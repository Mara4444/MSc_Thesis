Response:  On Monday (Julian date = 5), they played with 5 children.  On Tuesday (Julian date = 6), they played with 6 children.  So, on Wednesday (Julian date = 7), how many children did they play with?
Response:  On Sunday (July 18), they played with 4 children. On Monday (July 19), they played with some of those same children again. So, there were 4 + some = x children who played together on Monday. Since they played with half of them on Tuesday (July 20), there were x / 2 = y children who played together on Tuesday. Therefore, on Wednesday (July 21), they played with y children.
Response:  On Monday (July 4), they played with 7 children.  On Tuesday (July 5), they played with 13 children. So, on Wednesday (July 6), how many children did they play with?  We know that the number of children is always less than or equal to 13, so the answer must be between 0 and 13. Therefore, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  Bobble has eaten 25 chocolates and then he ate another 25 chocolates. So, in total, Bobble has eaten 50 chocolates. Now, if he had eaten 43 more chocolates, then he would have eaten a total of 93 chocolates.
Response:  Bobble drank 28 cups of tea and then he had 42 more cups. So, in total, Bobble drank 60 cups of tea.
Response:  Bobble drank 33 cups of tea and then he ate 4 more cups. So, in total, Bobble drank 37 cups of tea (33 + 4). Now, let's calculate how many teabags were used to make those cups of tea. If each cup of tea requires 1 teabag, then Bobble used 37 teabags in total (37 x 1 = 37).
Response:  Bobie gave away 38 chocolates and then had 36 left. He then gave away another 16 chocolates, leaving him with 16 remaining. So, the number of chocolates Bobie gave away is: 38 + 16 = 54 chocolates.
Response:  Bobble had 20 chocolates and he ate 34 of them. After that, he had 18 left. So, Bobble ate 34 - 20 = 14 chocolates in total.
Response:  Bobble gave away 21 chocolates at first. Then he ate 5 more and had 9 left. So, in total, Bobble ate 26 chocolates (21 + 5).
Response:  Bobble had eaten 22 chocolates and then he had some more. He ate 5 more chocolates after that. So, in total, Bobble ate 27 chocolates (22 + 5).
Response:  Bobble gave away 19 chocolates and then had 2 left. So, he had 20 chocolates initially (19 + 1). Now, he gave away 2 chocolates, so he has 18 chocolates left (20 - 2). Therefore, Bobble has 18 chocolates left.
Response:  Bobie has already eaten 32 chocolates and wants to know how many more he needs to eat to have exactly 20 chocolates left. So, if Bobie has already eaten 32 chocolates, then he has 20 - 32 = -18 chocolates left. Since Bobie cannot have negative chocolates, he needs to eat 18 more chocolates to reach his goal of having exactly 20 chocolates left. Therefore, Bobie needs to eat 18 + 32 = 50 chocolates in total.
Response:  Bob has eaten 17 chocolates and then he had 15 more. So, in total, Bob has eaten 32 chocolates (17 + 15). If Surumaa had 36 chocolates initially, she now has 0 chocolates left (36 - 32 = 0).
Response:  Bob has eaten 23 chocolates and Surumaa has eaten 30 chocolates. Now, if we add the number of chocolates that Bob has eaten to the number of chocolates that Surumaa has eaten, we get:  23 + 30 = 53. So, there are 53 chocolates left in the box.
"Response:  We have to find out how much Elon will get after 5 years and then compare it with Jack's salary after 3 years.

After 5 years, Elon's salary will be $100,000 x 5 = $500,000.

Now, let's calculate Jack's salary after 3 years. Since he is getting a 20% raise every year, his salary after 3 years will be $80,000 x 3 = $240,000.

So, the difference between Elon's and Jack's salaries after 5 years is: $500,000 - $240,000 = $260,000."
Response:  We have to find out how much Elon will pay for Jackie's parking ticket if he pays $2 more than twice the amount of the fine. So, we need to calculate the fine first. According to the question, the fine is Rs. 300. Therefore, if Elon pays $2 more than twice the amount of the fine, he will pay: $2 x 2 = $4 + $300 = $304. So, Elon will pay $304 for Jackie's parking ticket.
Response:  If Elon has 3 watermelons and Jackie takes 2 watermelons from him, then Elon will have 1 watermelon left. Now, if Jackie takes another watermelon from Elon, he will have none left. So, the final number of watermelons that Jackie will take is 1.
Response:  If Jackie had 6 watermelons and gave away 4 of them to Ella, then he has 6 - 4 = 2 watermelons left. Now, if Ella also got 2 more watermelons from somewhere else, then she has 2 + 2 = 4 watermelons in total. So, the final number of watermelons that Ella has is 4.
Response:  If Elena had 5 watermelons and Jack took away 2 watermelons from her, then Elena has 3 watermelons left. Now, if Jack takes away another watermelon from Elena, she will have 2 watermelons left. So, in total, Jack took away 3 + 1 = 4 watermelons from Elena.
Response:  We know that Elon has 3 vats of water and Jack has 5 vats of water. So, if we want to find out how much water Elon has, we need to subtract the number of vats Jack has from the total number of vats Elon has. Therefore, Elon has 2 vats of water. Now, let's calculate the amount of water Jack has. Since Jack has 5 vats of water and each vat contains 4 liters, then Jack has 5 x 4 = 20 liters of water.
"Response:  We have to find out how much Elon will pay for Jackie's parking ticket and then calculate how much more he has to pay after getting a discount of 30%.

Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of the parking ticket without any discount. According to the question, the fine is Rs. 200 per hour or Rs. 400 for 2 hours. So, the total cost of the parking ticket is:

Rs. 400 (for 2 hours) = Rs. 200 x 2 hours

Now, let's apply the discount of 30% to the cost of the parking ticket. To do this, we need to calculate 30% of the total cost of the parking ticket:

Rs. 200 x 30% = Rs. 60

So, the amount that Elon needs to pay after applying the discount is:

Rs. 400 - Rs. 60 = Rs. 340

Therefore, Elon needs to pay Rs. 340 for Jackie's parking ticket."
"Response:  We have to find out how much Elon will pay for Jackie's parking ticket and then calculate how much more he has to pay after getting a discount of 30%.

Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of the parking ticket without any discount. According to the question, the fine is Rs. 2000. So, the total amount that Elon needs to pay for Jackie's parking ticket is:

Rs. 2000 x 1 = Rs. 2000

Now, let's apply the discount of 30% to the total amount. To do this, we need to multiply the original amount by 0.7 (which is the reciprocal of 1 - 0.3). Therefore, the discounted amount that Elon needs to pay is:

Rs. 2000 x 0.7 = Rs. 1400

So, the final amount that Elon needs to pay for Jackie's parking ticket is:

Rs. 2000 + Rs. 1400 = Rs. 3400

Therefore, the answer to the question is Rs. 3400."
Response:  We know that Elena has 5 vats of rice and Jack has 4 vats of rice. So, if they share equally, each will get 3 vats of rice (5/2 = 3). Now, we need to find out how many vats of rice Elena had initially. If she had 5 vats of rice initially, then she had 1/2 vat less than what she shared with Jack (5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, Elena had 2 vats of rice initially.
Response:  We have to find out how much Elon will gain from Jack's parked car.  If Elon buys 6 vats of jackfruit at Rs. 20 per vat and sells it for Rs. 30 per vat, then he will gain Rs. 10 (Rs. 30 - Rs. 20) per vat. Since there are 2 vats in total, Elon will gain Rs. 20 (Rs. 10 x 2 vats). So, Elon will gain Rs. 20 from Jack's parked car.
Response:  We have to find out how much Jackie's park will increase in value if Elon's house is sold for $6 million and Jackie buys it for $3 million.  So, the difference between what Elon paid ($6 million - $3 million) is $3 million.  Now, we need to calculate how much of that amount Jackie will pay as taxes.  If Jackie pays $4 million for the park, then he has to pay taxes on the remaining amount, which is $900,000 (($4 million - $3 million)).
Response:  We have to find out how many times 5 can be divided into 6 without leaving any remainder.  So, we need to divide 5 by 6 and see if there is any remainder left.  When we divide 5 by 6, we get a quotient of 0 with no remainder, so we can say that 5 can be divided into 6 exactly zero times. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Elon has 3 vats of beer and Jack has 5 vats of beer. If we convert both amounts to balloons, then:  Elon has 3 x 10 = 30 balloons and Jack has 5 x 10 = 50 balloons. Now, let's compare their balloon collection: Elon has 30 balloons and Jack has 50 balloons, so Jack has more balloons than Elon.
Response:  We know that Elena has 7 balls and Jack has 6 balls. If we add both their numbers, we get: 7 + 6 = 13. So, Elena and Jack together have 13 balls.
Response:  If Elon can make 5 vats of beer in 1 hour, then he can make 6 vats of beer in 2 hours (since there are 2 hours). So, if Jackle can make 6 vats of beer in 3 hours, then he can make 9 vats of beer in 4 hours ( since there are 4 hours and Jackle can make 6 vats in 3 hours). Therefore, Jackle can make 12 vats of beer in 5 hours ( since there are 5 hours and Jackle can make 9 vats in 4 hours)
Response:  If we have taken out 2 watermelons from the park and given them to Jack, then there are 3 watermelons left in the park. Now, if we take another 6 watermelons from the park and give them to Jack, how many watermelons will be left in the park for us? So, the answer is 3 - 6 = -3 watermelons.
Response:  We know that Rajan can speak English for 6 hours and Chinese for 2 hours every day. So in total, he spends 8 hours speaking languages daily. Now, if we want to increase the time spent speaking English, how many extra hours will it take to make up for the lost time? Well, let's see... If Rajan wants to spend an additional 2 hours speaking English every day, it means he will have to spend a total of 8 + 2 = 10 hours speaking English per day. Therefore, it will take him 5 days (10 hours/day x 5 days) to catch up with the lost time.
Response:  We know that Rajan can speak English for 6 hours and Chinese for 7 hours in a day. So, he spends 6 + 7 = 13 hours speaking languages every day. Now, we need to find out how many minutes Rajan spends speaking each language per hour. To do this, we divide the total time spent speaking each language by the number of hours he spends speaking it. For example, if Rajan spends 6 hours speaking English, then he spends 6/13 \* 60 = 42 minutes speaking English per hour. Similarly, if he spends 7 hours speaking Chinese, then he spends 7/13 \* 60 = 54 minutes speaking Chinese per hour. Therefore, Rajan spends 42 minutes speaking English and 54 minutes speaking Chinese per hour.
Response:  If he can speak English for three hours every day and some other language for one hour, then in total he spends 4 hours per day speaking languages (3 + 1 = 4). So, if he continues this routine daily, in how many days will he be able to learn all the languages of the world?  Answer:  To calculate the number of days it would take him to learn all the languages of the world, we need to divide the total time he has available to learn languages by the number of languages he wants to learn. Assuming there are approximately 7,000 languages spoken around the world, let's assume he wants to learn all of them.  Therefore, the number of days required to learn all the languages of the world is:  Total time available to learn languages / Number of languages wanted to learn = 4 hours/day x 365 days/year / 7,000 languages = Approximately 28 years and 9 months.
Response:  If he takes 7 hours to learn English every day and wants to spend at least 2 hours practicing English per day, then in total, he will need 91 days (7 x 2 = 14) to reach his goal of fluency in English.
Response:  If he speaks Hindi for 5 hours and English for 2 hours every day, then in total, he spends 7 hours speaking languages per day (5 + 2 = 7). Now, if we assume that each hour of language learning takes 1/4th of his daily time, then he can learn 7 x 1/4 = 1.75 hours of English per day. So, it will take him approximately 1.75 days to learn 2 hours of English (1.75 x 2 = 3.5 days). Therefore, the answer is 3.5 days.
"Response:  If he can study for 5 days in a week and each day he studies for 6 hours of English and 7 hours of Chinese, then in one week (Monday to Sunday) he will study for a total of:

English = 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese = 7 x 5 = 35 hours

So, in one month (30 days), he will study for a total of:

English = 30 x 30 = 900 hours
Chinese = 35 x 30 = 1050 hours

Therefore, if he studies for 5 days a week, in one month he will have studied for a total of 900 hours of English and 1050 hours of Chinese."
Response:  If he can speak English for 6 hours and Hindi for 5 hours every day, then in one week (7 days), he will spend 42 hours speaking English and 35 hours speaking Hindi. So, in total, he will have spent 77 hours speaking English and Hindi in that week.
Response:  If he speaks English for 5 hours and Chinese for 4 hours every day, then in total, he will have spoken English for 150 hours (5 x 30) and Chinese for 120 hours (4 x 30). So, his total speaking time in both languages is 270 hours (150 + 120).
Response:  If he can read English for 4 hours and Chinese for 6 hours every day, then in total, he will have spent 86 days reading English and 132 days reading Chinese. So, his overall total is 218 days.
"Response:  The given information is as follows:

* Harikrishna can speak English for 6 hours per day.
* He can listen to Chinese for 7 hours per day.
* He can speak Spanish for 3 hours per day.

Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends speaking each language in total:

English: 6 hours/day x 24 hours/day = 144 hours/week
Chinese: 7 hours/day x 24 hours/day = 168 hours/week
Spanish: 3 hours/day x 24 hours/day = 72 hours/week

So, Harikrishna spends a total of 384 hours (144 + 168 + 72) per week learning languages."
"Response:  The given information is as follows:

* Harish takes 6 hours to learn English every day.
* He spends 3 hours studying English in the morning and 58 minutes in the evening.
* In total, he spends 9 hours and 20 minutes learning English per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take him to learn English fluently. We can do this by dividing the total time spent learning English by the time taken to learn one hour of English.

Time taken to learn one hour of English = Total time spent learning English / Number of hours learned per day
= 9 hours 20 minutes / 9 hours (as he learns for 9 hours per day)
= 1 hour 12 minutes

So, it will take Harish approximately 1 hour and 12 minutes to learn one hour of English. To find out how many hours he will take to learn fluent English, we can multiply the number of hours he learns per day by the number of days he has been learning English.

Number of hours to learn fluent English = Number of hours learned per day x Number of days learned
= 9 hours x 7 days (as he has been learning for 7 days)
= 63 hours

Therefore, it will take Harish approximately 63 hours to learn fluent English."
"Response:  We know that Rajan can speak English for 7 hours and Spanish for 4 hours in a day. So, he spends 2 hours speaking Chinese. Therefore, the total time spent by Rajan speaking different languages is:

English = 7 hours x 2 times/day = 14 hours per day
Spanish = 4 hours x 2 times/day = 8 hours per day
Chinese = 2 hours x 1 time/day = 2 hours per day

Now, let's calculate how much time Rajan spends speaking each language every week:

Weekly English = Daily English x 7 days = 14 hours x 7 days = 98 hours per week
Weekly Spanish = Daily Spanish x 7 days = 8 hours x 7 days = 56 hours per week
Weekly Chinese = Daily Chinese x 7 days = 2 hours x 7 days = 14 hours per week

So, Rajan spends approximately 98 hours per week speaking English, 56 hours per week speaking Spanish, and 14 hours per week speaking Chinese."
Response:  We know that Rajan can speak English for 2 hours every day and Spanish for 4 hours every day. So in total, he spends 6 hours (2 x 2 = 4 + 4) speaking languages every day. Now, we need to find out how many minutes are there in 6 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day. Therefore, Rajan spends 360 minutes speaking languages every day.
"Response:  If he spends 3 hours daily studying English and Hindi for 2 months, then in total he will spend:

English = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes/day \* 2 months = 720 minutes
Hindi = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes/day \* 2 months = 720 minutes
Total time spent = English + Hindi = 720 + 720 = 1440 minutes
Therefore, he will spend approximately 24 hours (1440 / 60) to learn both languages."
Response:  The person wants to learn English and Chinese languages for 7 days a week. For each day, they will spend 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese. So, in total, they will study English for 28 hours (4 x 7) and Chinese for 35 hours (5 x 7). Therefore, the total time spent learning both languages is 63 hours (28 + 35).
Response:  On Sunday (8th), they had 8 bowls of rice.  The next day (Monday) they had 7 bowls of rice. So, in total, they had 15 bowls of rice (8 + 7).
Response:  On Sunday (7th), they had 12 thalis. Then on Monday (8th), they had 13 more than the previous day, so it was 15 thalis. On Tuesday (9th), they had 12 + 1 = 13 thalis more than the previous day, so it was 28 thalis. Therefore, on Wednesday (10th), they had 28 - 1 = 27 thalis.
Response:  On Sunday (day 1), they had 4 bowls of rice each containing 200 grams. So, in total, they consumed 800 grams of rice that day.  On Monday (day 2), they had 3 bowls of rice each containing 200 grams. So, in total, they consumed 600 grams of rice that day.  On Tuesday (day 3), they had 2 bowls of rice each containing 200 grams. So, in total, they consumed 400 grams of rice that day.  Therefore, if they had a total of 6 bowls of rice per day, and each bowl contains 200 grams, then they would have consumed a total of 1200 grams of rice per day.
Response:  On Sunday, they had 4 watermelons and divided them equally among 8 people, so each person got 1/2 watermelon.  Now, let's calculate how many watermelons they will have on Monday if they eat 4 more watermelons in total. So, on Monday, they will have 4 + 4 = 8 watermelons in total. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Sunday (10th), they had 3 bowls of rice. So, in total, they had 3 x 10 = 30 bowls of rice. Then, on Monday (11th), they had 7 bowls of rice. Therefore, in total, they had 30 + 7 = 37 bowls of rice.
Response:  On Sunday (8th), they had breakfast at 9 am and lunch at 3 pm. So, they had 6 meals in total that day.  On Monday (9th), they had breakfast at 7 am and lunch at 12 pm. So, they had 4 meals in total that day. Therefore, the difference between their breakfast and lunch times is 5 hours (9 am - 3 pm).
Response:  On Sunday, they had 3 bowls of rice and 4 bowls of lentil soup.  On Monday, they had 7 bowls of rice and 44 bowls of lentil soup. So in total, they had 10 + 44 = 54 bowls of food.
Response:  We know that Basnet has scored 17 runs in the first innings and 16 runs in the second innings. So, the total number of runs scored by Basnet is: 17 + 16 = 33 runs. Therefore, the difference between the number of runs scored by Basnet in the two innings is: 33 - 20 = 13 runs.
Response:  We know that there are 5 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a week is 5 x 24 = 120 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours of sleep a person gets in an average night. According to the question, a person sleeps for 7-8 hours per night on average. Therefore, the number of hours of sleep a person gets in a week is 7-8 hours/night x 7 nights (as there are 7 nights in a week) = 49-60 hours/week. Finally, we need to calculate the difference between the total hours in a week and the number of hours of sleep a person gets in a week. This gives us the amount of time spent awake during the day. In this case, the difference is 120 - 49 = 71 hours/week.
"Response:  If there are 10 baskets of rice and each basket contains 5 kg of rice, then the total weight of all the baskets is:

10 baskets x 5 kg/basket = 50 kg

So, if there are 15 baskets in total, the total weight of all the baskets would be:

50 kg x 15 baskets = 750 kg"
"Response:  If there are 10 vats of water in the container and each vat contains 3 liters of water, then the total volume of water in the container is:

10 vats x 3 liters/vat = 30 liters

Now, if we add 5 more vats of water to the container, the total volume of water in the container becomes:

30 liters + (5 vats x 3 liters/vat) = 45 liters

Therefore, the number of vats of water that can be added to the container without overflowing is:

45 liters / 3 liters/vat = 15 vats"
Response:  We have to find out how many baskets are required for each of the given quantities.  For 7 watas of rice, we need 15 baskets (7 x 2 = 14). For 8 watas of wheat, we need 8 baskets (8 x 2 = 16). So, in total, we need 23 baskets (15 + 16 = 23). Therefore, there will be 23 baskets of grains in the basket.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 7, 8 and 9 can be divided into 71 and 80 respectively.  So, we need to divide each number by 71 and 80 separately.  Now, let's see what happens when we divide 7 by 71: 7 / 71 = 0.10 (approximately) Similarly, when we divide 8 by 71: 8 / 71 = 0.11 (approximately) And finally, when we divide 9 by 80: 9 / 80 = 0.1125 (approximately) As you can see, all of these numbers are very close to each other, but not exactly equal. Therefore, the difference between the number of times 7, 8 and 9 can be divided into 71 and 80 is approximately 0.0075 or 0.75%.
"Response:  We have:

2 watermelons (2 x 1400 = 2800 grams) + 6 apples (6 x 150 = 900 grams) + 14 bananas (14 x 100 = 1400 grams) = total weight of fruits = 3140 grams
So, the number of bananas in 14 bunches is 14/3140 = 0.0447 or approximately 4 bananas per bunch."
Response:  We have 19 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a week are: 19 x 24 = 4672 hours. Now, let's calculate the number of hours during rainy season (June to September): 3 months x 24 hours/day = 720 hours. And during winter season (December to February): 3 months x 24 hours/day = 720 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours during rainy season is 720 + 720 = 1440 hours.
Response:  We know that 6 hours have passed since Rato and Hariko started their work. So, they have worked for 6/90 = 1/15 of the total time (i.e., 90 minutes). Therefore, Rato has worked for 1/15 x 16 = 4 minutes, and Hariko has worked for 1/15 x 16 = 2 minutes.
Response:  We know that there are 18 hours in a day and 14 hours of daylight. So, during the nighttime, there will be 4 hours of darkness (18 - 14 = 4). Therefore, the number of hours of light during the day is 14, and the number of hours of darkness at night is 4.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 days in a week and 14 hours in a day. So, we have:

5 days x 24 hours/day = 120 hours/week

Now, let's calculate how many hours Basu has worked:

Basu works for 6 hours/day, so he has worked:

6 hours/day x 7 days/week = 42 hours/week

So, Basu has worked a total of 120 hours + 42 hours = 162 hours in one month."
Response:  We know that there are 65 tokers in total and each bascket has 7 watermelons and 3 water bottles. So, the total number of watermelons is: 65 x 7 = 455 watermelons And the total number of water bottles is: 65 x 3 = 195 water bottles Therefore, the answer is: 455 + 195 = 640
Response:  We know that there are 11 baskets of fruits and vegetables in total. Each basket contains 10 apples and 18 tomatoes. So, the total number of apples is 10 x 11 = 110 apples. Similarly, the total number of tomatoes is 18 x 11 = 208 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of fruits and vegetables is 110 + 208 = 318.
Response:  We have to calculate the total number of baskets and then multiply it with the weight per basket to get the total weight.  So, we need to know the following information: 1. Number of baskets (6) 2. Weight of each basket (16 kg) 3. Total weight of one basket (16 kg x 6 = 96 kg) Now, let's find out how many rupees are needed for 96 kg rice: Price per kilogram of rice = ₹18 Cost per kilogram of rice = ₹18 x 96 kg = ₹1744 So, the total amount needed for 96 kg rice is ₹1744.
Response:  We know that there are 7 baskets of alu (potatoes) and each basket contains 10 units of potatoes. So, the total number of potatoes in all 7 baskets is: 7 x 10 = 70 units of potatoes. Now, we also know that out of these 70 units of potatoes, 2 units are wasted due to rotting or other reasons. Therefore, the actual number of usable potatoes is: 70 - 2 = 68 units of potatoes.
Response:  We know that each basket contains 4 watermelons and 3 watermelons are harvested per day. So, in total, 7 baskets can be harvested per day. Therefore, the number of watermelons harvested is: 7 x 4 = 28 watermelons.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 baskets of rice and each basket contains 4 cups of rice. So, the total number of cups of rice in all 12 baskets is:

12 baskets x 4 cups/basket = 48 cups

Now, we need to find out how many cups of rice are left after one basket is emptied. Since there are 4 cups in each basket, if one basket is emptied, then:

48 cups - 4 cups (from one basket) = 44 cups

So, if all 12 baskets are empty, then there are 44 cups of rice left."
Response:  We know that there are 16 tokens in total and we have to find out how many haris (baskets) of 13 tokens each can be made from them. So, we need to divide 16 by 13 to get the number of baskets.  Therefore, the answer is: 16 / 13 = 2 baskets.
"Response:  We know that each parcel takes 19 hours to reach its destination and there are 4 parcels in total. So, the total time taken for all 4 parcels to reach their destinations is:

Time taken = Total distance / Speed of delivery = 19 x 4 = 76 hours

Now, we are given that there are 15 hours left after the delivery process starts. Therefore, the time when the delivery process started can be calculated as follows:

Starting time = Remaining time + Delivery time = 76 - 15 = 61 hours ago

So, the delivery process started 61 hours ago."
"Response:  If there are 10 tokri (baskets) and each basket contains 4 vata (units of measurement), then the total number of units in all 10 baskets is:

4 vata/basket x 10 baskets = 40 vata

Now, if each tokri has 6 haris (units of measurement), then the total number of haris in all 10 tokris is:

6 haris/tokri x 10 tokris = 60 haris

So, the total number of units in all 10 tokris is:

40 vata + 60 haris = 100 units"
Response:  We have to find out how many times the value of $60 can be filled in 7 watermelons and how much is left after filling 3 watermelons.  Firstly, we need to convert the given amount of money ($60) into watermelons. Since each watermelon costs $\$20$, we can fill $60 / \$20 = 3$ watermelons with this amount of money. Now, let's calculate how many watermelons can be filled with the remaining amount of money: $60 - (3 \times \$20) = \$40$. So, we can fill $\$40 / \$20 = 2$ more watermelons with the remaining money. Therefore, the total number of watermelons that can be filled with the given amount of money is $3 + 2 = 5$.
Response:  If Jeremy has 8 vats of oil and he gives 2 vats to his friend, then Jeremy will have 6 vats of oil left (8 - 2 = 6). Now, if his friend also gives him 3 vats of oil, then Jeremy will have 9 vats of oil in total (6 + 3 = 9). So, the answer is 9 vats of oil.
Response:  If there are 7 questions in total and each question has 10 options, then the total number of options is 7 x 10 = 70. So, if Jeremy answers 35 out of 70 questions correctly, his overall score would be 35/70 or 50%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has 22 vats of oil and he sold 6 vats to Shelby. So, now Jerry has 16 vats of oil left (22 - 6 = 16). Now, we are asked how many vats of oil Jerry had initially if he sold 22 vats in total. Therefore, the answer is 22 vats (initial amount).
Response:  Firstly, Jerry gave 5 vats of oil to Kotha and asked him to share it equally among 9 people. So, each person got 1/2 vat (or 0.5 vat) of oil from Jerry. Now, Kotha had 7 vats of oil left after sharing with those 9 people. If he wanted to give 3 vats of oil to someone else, how many vats would he have left? Solution:  We know that Kotha had 7 vats of oil left after sharing with the first group of 9 people. If he gives 3 vats of oil to someone else, then he will have 7 - 3 = 4 vats of oil left. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 vats.
Response:  We have two variables - $x$ and $y$. The equation is given as: $\frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{10} = \frac{1}{3}$. Now we need to find out how many times $y$ can be multiplied by $10$ to make it equal to $x$. So, we divide both sides of the equation by $\frac{y}{10}$: $\frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{10} = \frac{1}{3} \Rightarrow \frac{x}{2} = \frac{4}{5} \times \frac{y}{10}$ Now, we know that $x=8$, so $y = 8 \times 10 = 80$. Therefore, the number of times $y$ can be multiplied by $10$ to make it equal to $x$ is $80/10 = 8$.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of pages in 8 books and 9 books as follows:  Number of pages in 8 books = 8 x 16 = 128 pages Number of pages in 9 books = 9 x 16 = 144 pages Now, let's find out how many pages are there in all the books together: Total number of pages = 128 + 144 = 272 pages Therefore, the total number of pages in all the books is 272 pages.
Response:  We have to find out how many books Jerry can buy with $7 and how much money he will have left after buying those books.  If Jerry wants to buy 3 books of $2 each, then he will spend $6 (3 x $2). So, he will have $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). Now, if he wants to buy another book worth $5, he won't be able to do so as he doesn't have enough money. Therefore, the maximum number of books Jerry can buy is 3.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many pages are there in each book. As per the given information, one book has 5 pages and another book has 2 pages. So, the total number of pages in both books is : 5 + 2 = 7 pages. Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of pages in the original book (9 pages) and the number of pages after cutting (7 pages). Therefore, the answer is: 9 - 7 = 2 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of vats Jerry has. As per the question, Jerry has 8 vats and eachvat contains 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs Jerry has is : 8 x 4 = 32 eggs. Now, out of these 32 eggs, 16 are old eggs and need to be thrown away. So, the remaining eggs that Jerry has after throwing away the old ones are : 32 - 16 = 16 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs Jerry has is 16 vats.
Response:  If there are 3 questions in total and each question has 4 options, then the total number of options is 3 x 4 = 12. Now, if we have to distribute these 12 options among 6 people, each person will get 12/6 = 2 options. So, each person will have 2 options from the total of 12 options.
Response:  If Jeremy has 7 watermelons and he gives away 3 to his friend, then he will have 7 - 3 = 4 watermelons left.  Now, if he gives away another 2 watermelons to his other friend, he will have 4 - 2 = 2 watermelons left. So, Jeremy has 2 watermelons left.
Response:  If we had taken 2 vats of water from the well and returned 7 vats of water, then if we had taken 10 vats of water from the well, how many vats of water would we have left in the well after returning 5 vats of water?  So, the answer is 5 vats.
Response:  If Jeremy had 9 watermelons and gave 7 to Shelly, then he has 2 watermelons left (9 - 7 = 2). Now, if Shelly also received an additional 10 watermelons from someone else, she would have a total of 17 watermelons (7 + 10 = 17). So, the number of watermelons that Shelly received from Jeremy is 10.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many pages are there in each book.  For Book 1, there are 320 pages, and for Book 2, there are 480 pages.  Now, let's calculate the total number of pages in all three books together.  The total number of pages is 320 + 480 = 800 pages.  So, if Jeremy reads 25% of these pages, he will read 25% of 800 pages, which is equal to 200 pages.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy read 7 books and answered 3 questions correctly in his first exam. Then he studied for 2 hours and answered 4 more questions correctly in his second exam. So, the total number of correct answers Jeremy gave in both exams is: 7 + 3 = 10. Now, let's find out how many books Jeremy read to get this score. Since each book took him 1 hour to read, he read 10 books in total (10 x 1 hour/book). Therefore, the answer is: Books read = 10.
Response:  We know that there are initially 2 vats of water (1 + 1 = 2). If each vat can hold up to 6 cups of water, then the total capacity of both vats is 6 x 2 = 12 cups. Now, if we add 3 more vats of water, the total capacity will be 12 + 3 = 15 cups. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  We have 4 birds that can fly in total of 5 trees. So, each bird can fly to how many trees?  To find out, we divide the total number of trees (5) by the number of birds (4). Therefore, each bird can fly to 1 tree.
Response:  We have 46 vats of barley and 7 other grains. If we distribute these grains equally among 10 baskets, then how many vats will each basket contain?  So, the answer is 46/10 = 4.6 vats per basket.
Response:  We have 3 crows and 2 storks. The total number of birds is 5 (3 crows + 2 storks). So, the number of birds that can fit in one basket is 5/2 = 2 1/2 baskets.
Response:  We have 3 crows and 4 storks. Each crow can carry 2 bags of rice each, so we have 6 bags of rice in total from the crows (3 x 2 = 6). Now, each stork can carry 5 bags of rice each, so we have 20 bags of rice in total from the storks (4 x 5 = 20). Therefore, the total number of bags of rice that will be carried is 6 + 20 = 26 bags of rice.
Response:  We have 2 ducks and 3 birds. Each bird lays an average of 5 eggs per year. So, in total, we have 3 x 5 = 15 eggs from birds. Now, let's consider the situation where all the eggs hatched successfully. In that case, we would have 15 eggs + 2 ducklings = 17 offspring. Therefore, the number of chicks that grew into adult birds is 17.
Response:  We have 7 vats of water and we need to fill 4 vats with water from it. So, the number of vats left after filling 4 vats is 7 - 4 = 3 vats.
Response:  We know that there are 3 crows and 4 storks. Each crow can carry 6 bakulas (baby elephants). So, how many bakulas can each stork carry? Well, since there are 4 storks, they can carry a total of 4 x 6 = 24 bakulas together! Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  We have 6 crows and 3 storks. The crows can fly at most 4 km/hr (assuming they are not flying in formation). So, if they start flying together, they will cover a distance of 24 km (6 x 4 km/hr) in one hour. Now, let's assume that after an hour, two more crows join them, making it 8 crows in total. Since the storks cannot keep up with such a large group of birds, they slow down their flight to maintain a safe distance. Assuming they now fly at half the speed of the crows (i.e., 2 km/hr), they will cover a distance of 12 km (8 x 2 km/hr) in one hour. Therefore, the total distance covered by all the birds in one hour is 36 km (24 km + 12 km).
Response:  We have 6 vats of water and we added 3 more vats of water to it. So, now we have 9 vats of water in total. Now, each vat contains how much water? Well, if we had 6 vats initially containing 1/6th of the total water, then each vat contained 1/6 x 10 = 1.67 liters of water. Since we added 3 more vats, the total amount of water increased by 3 x 1.67 = 5.01 liters. Therefore, each vat now contains 1.67 + 5.01 = 6.68 liters of water.
Response:  We have to choose one option from each pair of options given in the question. So, we will start with the first pair and then move to the next pair and so on.  Option A - 10 Option B - 5  Option C - 20  Option D - 30 Now, let's calculate the total value of the options chosen: Option A (10) + Option B (5) = 15 Option C (20) + Option D (30) = 50 Therefore, the total value of the options chosen is 50.
Response:  We have 5 vats of water and we need to fill 4 vessels with equal amount of water. So, we will divide the total amount of water equally among the 4 vessels, which means each vessel will get 1/5 th part of the total water. Now, let's calculate how much water each vessel will get:  Total amount of water = 5 vats x capacity of one vat = 5 x 20 liters = 100 liters. Since we want to fill 4 vessels equally, so each vessel will get 100 liters / 4 = 25 liters of water. Therefore, the answer is 25 liters.
Response:  We have three bags of capacity 3, 5 and 7. Initially, each bag contains an equal number of balls (20). Now, we take out one ball from each bag and put it in a common basket. So, after this process, there are 18 balls left in each bag. Then, we take out two balls from each bag and put them in another common basket. So, after this process, there are 16 balls left in each bag. Finally, we take out six balls from each bag and put them in yet another common basket. So, after this process, there are 10 balls left in each bag. Therefore, the number of balls that went into the last basket is 10 - 18 = -8.
Response:  We have 5 storks and each can carry 3 chicks. So, total number of chicks carried by all storks is 5 x 3 = 15 chicks. Now, there are 4 people who want to count the chicks. So, the remaining chicks after counting (i.e., the difference between total number of chicks and number of people wanting to count) is 15 - 4 = 11 chicks.
Response:  We have 3 birds and they can hold 2 baskets each. So in total, we have 6 baskets. Now, let's assume that each bird can carry 2 baskets at a time. Therefore, if all 3 birds go together to collect baskets, they will be able to carry 6 x 2 = 12 baskets altogether.
Response:  We have three bags of capacity 6, 8 and 2 vats each. Initially, there are 3 + 4 = 7 vats of water in total. Now, we pour 1 vat of water from one bag to another until all the water is transferred. So, after transferring 1 vat of water, we will have 7 - 1 = 6 vats of water left in the original bag, and 6 + 2 = 8 vats of water in the other two bags. Therefore, the number of vats of water that went into the third bag is 8 - 2 = 6 vats.
Response:  In the first chapter, there are 48 pages. To find out how many pages are in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages. So, the number of pages in the second chapter is: 48 - 48 = 0 pages. Therefore, there are no pages in the second chapter.
Response:  In the first chapter, there are 37 pages. In the second chapter, there are 80 pages. To find out how many pages are added in total, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. So, the difference is: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in both chapters is 37 + 43 = 80 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 60 pages, and there are total 93 pages in the book. So, if we divide the number of pages by two, we get:  Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / 2 = 93 / 2 = 46.5 pages per chapter. Therefore, there are approximately 47 pages in each of the remaining two chapters (Chapters 2 and 3).
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 36 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is: 2 x 36 = 72 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 66 pages, the second chapter has 35 pages, and the third chapter has 24 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages less than the first chapter (i.e., 68 pages), and the third chapter has 25 pages less than the second chapter (i.e., 43 pages). Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Chapter 1: 91 pages Chapter 2: 68 - 23 = 45 pages Chapter 3: 43 - 25 = 18 pages So, the difference between the number of pages in the first two chapters is 45 - 23 = 22 pages, and the difference between the second and third chapters is 18 - 25 = -7 pages.
Response:  In the first chapter, there are 35 pages. In the second chapter, there are 18 pages. And in the third chapter, there are 20 pages. So, if we compare the number of pages between the three chapters, the third chapter has more pages than the other two chapters combined (35 + 18 = 53). Therefore, the correct answer is 53 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, the second chapter has 75 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:  53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 149 pages.
"Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book. Each chapter has 61 pages, so we can write:

Chapters = 31 x 61 = 1891 pages

So, the total number of pages in the book is 1891 pages."
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and 23 pages in total. Since there are 10 pages in each chapter, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 23 / 2 = 11 pages So, there are 11 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  The book has 81 pages, and there are 2 chapters in total. Each chapter contains 68 pages, so we have: Chapter 1: 68 pages x 2 = 136 pages Chapter 2: 68 pages x 2 = 136 pages Total number of pages in the book: 81 + 136 + 136 = 453 pages
Response:  We know that there are 62 people who went to Shivir and returned home. Out of them, 39 people did not get their due amount from the fundraising event. So, the number of people who got their due amount is: 62 - 39 = 23.
Response:  We know that there are 52 people in the group and they have to cross the river.  Out of them, 61 people can cross the river at once. So, we need to find out how many times 61 is divided by 52.  To do this, we divide 61 by 52: 61 ÷ 52 = 1.17  Therefore, the number of times 61 people can cross the river at once is 1.17 times.
Response:  We know that there are 32 people in total who went to the camp and returned home every day for 15 days. So, the total number of people who went to the camp = 32. Now, we need to find out how many people went to the camp each day. To do this, we divide the total number of people by the number of days they were at the camp: Total number of people per day = Total number of people / Number of days at the camp = 32 / 15 = 2.13 (approximately) Therefore, approximately 2.13 people went to the camp each day.
Response:  We know that there are 70 people in the village who have gone to the city for work.  Out of them, 60 people went to the city every day during those 15 days. So, the total number of people who went to the city is: 60 x 15 = 900 people.
Response:  We have to find out how many people went for the trek and how many of them returned.  So, we can start with the given information: 36 people went for the trek, 13 people did not return, and 49 people returned.  Now, let's calculate the number of people who went for the trek but did not return: 36 - 13 = 23 people.  Therefore, 23 people went for the trek but did not return.
Response:  We have to find out how many people went for the trek and how many of them returned.  So, we need to subtract the number of people who did not return from the total number of people who went for the trek.  Now, let's analyze the given information:  Total number of people who went for the trek = 44 People went for the trek but 39 people did not return, so the number of people who returned = Total number of people who went for the trek - Number of people who did not return = 44 - 39 = 5 people. Therefore, 5 people returned from the trek.
Response:  We have to find out how many people went for the trek and how many of them returned.  So, we need to subtract the number of people who did not return from the total number of people who went for the trek.  Now, let's analyze the given information:  Total number of people who went for the trek = 53  Number of people who did not return = 48  Therefore, the number of people who returned = Total number of people who went for the trek - Number of people who did not return = 53 - 48 = 5  So, five people returned from the trek.
"Response:  We have to find out how many people can fit in a room of size 33 feet x 34 feet.  To do this, we need to know the dimensions of each person.  Let's assume that each person takes up an area of 10 square feet (this is just an estimate and may vary depending on the individual).  So, if there are 33 people in the room, their total area would be:

Area of 33 people = 33 x 10 = 330 square feet

Now, let's calculate the area of the remaining space in the room after all the people are accommodated:

Area of remaining space = Area of room - Area of 33 people
= 33 x 34 = 1152 square feet

So, there can fit 33 people in the room comfortably without overcrowding them."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 13 people went to the camp and 59 people returned from the camp. So, the total number of people who went to the camp is 13 + 59 = 72 people. Now, let's calculate how many people were absent during the camp. We are given that 21 people did not attend the camp at all, and among those who attended the camp, 30 people were absent for some reason or other. Therefore, the total number of absentees is 21 + (30 x 72) / 100 = 21 + 2160 / 100 = 2376. So, there were 2376 people present in the camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 29 people in total who went to the mountain for trekking and out of them, 6 were experienced climbers. So, the number of people who did not have any experience is 23 (29 - 6).  Now, among these 23 people, 10 were able to reach the top of the mountain safely. Therefore, the number of people who could not reach the top of the mountain safely is 13 (23 - 10).
Response:  Firstly, we know that 41 people went to the mountain and 26 of them returned. So, the number of people who did not return is 41 - 26 = 15.  Now, let's assume that all the 15 people who did not return were carrying duffel bags. Therefore, the total number of duffel bags carried by the 15 people who did not return is 15 x 3 (as each person can carry only three duffel bags) = 45 duffel bags.
Response: 46 people went to the camp and 38 of them returned home. So, the remaining 7 people did not return home.
Response:  If Rahul can walk 7 vats in 10 steps while carrying a load of 4 vats, then he will be able to carry 3 vats more than his own weight (i.e., 7 - 4 = 3). So, if Rahul weighs 20 vats, he will be able to carry 60 vats (i.e., 20 x 3 = 60).
Response:  Rahul took 4 vats of water and poured it into a smaller container, leaving 2 vats remaining. Now he wants to know how many vats of water he has left. So, the answer is 2 vats of water are left with him.
Response:  If Rahul has 7 watermelons and he gives away 3 to his friend, then he will have 4 watermelons left. Now, if he gets 5 more watermelons from his bank, he will have 9 watermelons in total. So, the number of watermelons Rahul has after getting 5 more watermelons from the bank is 9.
"Response:  If there are 7 watermarks in one side of the paper and we have to find out how many watermarks will be visible after folding it twice, then we can use the following logic:

1st fold: The number of watermarks that will be visible after the first fold is half of the total number of watermarks (i.e., 3/2). So, after the first fold, 3 watermarks will be visible.

2nd fold: After the second fold, the remaining 4 watermarks will be hidden from view. Therefore, the final number of watermarks visible after both folds is 3 + 4 = 7.

So, the answer is 7 watermarks will be visible after folding the paper twice."
Response:  We have 6 vats of rice and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 1.5 vats of rice (6/4 = 1.5). Now, let's say we have 2 vats of rice left over after distributing them equally among the 4 people. So, there are 4 vats of rice remaining (2/4 = 0.5), which means that 1/2 vat of rice is left over. Therefore, the total number of vats of rice distributed is 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 vats.
Response:  We have to find out how many vats of water are required to fill up the tank that can hold 23 vats of water. So, we need to divide 23 by 3, which gives us 7.5 vats of water needed to fill up the tank completely. Therefore, there are 7.5 vats of water left in the tank after filling it up to its capacity.
Response:  At first, there were 7 watermelons in the basket. Then, two new watermelons were added to the basket, making it 9 watermelons in total. Now, after another addition of 6 watermelons, there are 15 watermelons in the basket. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were added is 8 (15 - 7).
Response:  Rahul took 2 vats of water from his own well and gave 4 vats to his friend. Then, he dug another 3 vats of water from his own well. So, now he has 1 more vat of water than before. Therefore, the answer is 5 vats (5 वटा).
Response:  We have 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards. Each card has four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) with 13 ranks (Ace to King). So there are 52 x 4 = 208 possible combinations of suits and ranks. Now, let's assume that each combination is equally likely to occur. Therefore, the probability of drawing any particular card from the deck is 1/208. To find out how many Aces we drew, we need to divide the number of Aces by 208: 7 / 208 = 0.0336 or approximately 3.36%.
Response:  We have three rows of watermelons and each row has 8 watermelons. So, in total, we have 24 watermelons (3 rows x 8 watermelons/row). Now, let's calculate how many watermelons are there in each row. If we divide the total number of watermelons by the number of rows, we get 9 watermelons per row (24 watermelons / 3 rows = 9 watermelons/row). Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We have four rows of three watermelons each, and we need to calculate how many watermelons there are in total.  Each row has seven watermelons, so the total number of watermelons in one row is 7 x 4 = 28.  Now, there are two more rows, so the total number of watermelons is 28 + 28 = 56. Therefore, there are 56 watermelons in total.
Response:  We know that 2 vats of water were added to the field in the first place (line 3). Then, we are told that 19 vats of water were added again after some time (line 5). So, the total amount of water added to the field is: 2 vats + 19 vats = 21 vats. Now, we need to calculate how many bullets were made from this water. According to line 7, each vat of water can make 80 bullets. Therefore, the total number of bullets made from all the water added to the field is: 21 vats x 80 bullets/vat = 1680 bullets.
Response:  We know that Edson has 10 balls and he wants to give some of them to his friend Dag.  If Edson gives 45 balls to Dag, then how many balls will be left with him after giving those balls to Dag? So, the number of balls left with Edson is 10 - 45 = -35 balls. Therefore, the answer is -35 balls.
Response:  We know that Edson scored 22 goals in 7 matches, which means he scored an average of 3.14 goals per match (22/7). Now, we are told that Dag scored 6 goals in 5 matches, which means he scored an average of 1.20 goals per match (6/5). If Edson had played 5 matches instead of 7, how many goals would he have scored? To find this out, we can multiply his average goal score per match by the number of matches he played: 3.14 x 5 = 15.70 goals. So, if Edson had played 5 matches instead of 7, he would have scored 15.70 goals. Similarly, if Dag had played 7 matches instead of 5, how many goals would he have scored? To find this out, we can multiply his average goal score per match by the number of matches he played: 1.20 x 7 = 8.40 goals. So, if Dag had played 7 matches instead of 5, he would have scored 8.40 goals. Finally, let's compare the number of goals scored by both players to see who scored more: 15.70 > 8.40, so Edson scored more goals than Dag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 5 vats of water were poured into the field and 3 vats of water were drained out from the same field. So, there are 2 vats of water left in the field. Now, if each vat contains 27 golaharu (units), then the total number of golaharu remaining in the field is 2 x 27 = 54 golaharu.
Response:  We know that 24 balls were thrown in the field and 9 of them went into the goalpost. So, the number of goals scored is 9. Now, we need to find out how many shots were taken by each team. Since there are 2 teams, let's call them Team A and Team B. If Team A took x shots and scored y goals, then we can write an equation as follows:  x + y = 24 (since total number of shots = total number of goals)  Similarly, if Team B took z shots and scored w goals, we can write another equation:  z + w = 24 (again, total number of shots = total number of goals)  Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x and y using these equations?
Response:  We know that in the maidan (field), there are 17 balls. If each ball weighs 0.29 kg, then the total weight of all the balls is: 17 x 0.29 = 4.83 kg. Now, let's calculate how many balls can be made with this weight of gold. Since one ball weighs approximately 0.05 kg, we can make: 4.83 / 0.05 = 96.6 balls. So, there can be approximately 96.6 balls made from the given weight of gold.
"Response:  We know that in the first game, Aditya scored 19 points and lost by 8 points to his opponent. Now, in the second game, Aditya has improved his score to 15 points but still lost by 7 points. So, the difference between Aditya's scores in the two games is:

19 - 15 = 4 points

Therefore, Aditya scored 4 more points in the second game than he did in the first game."
Response:  We know that in the maidan, there are 21 balls and 30 players. If each player hits 91 balls, then how many balls will be left for Edel? Since Edel has to hit all the remaining balls, we can calculate the number of balls he needs to hit. So, the answer is 91 - 21 = 70 balls.
Response:  We know that there are 12 balls in total and we have already thrown away 8 of them (which means we have 4 left). Now, if we throw away another ball, we will have 3 left. So, the number of balls remaining after throwing away another ball is 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3.
"Response:  If there are 408 students and each student has to bring Rs. 420 for lunch, then the total amount of money that needs to be collected is:

408 students x Rs. 420 per student = Rs. 176,560

So, out of the total amount of money needed (Rs. 176,560), if 32 students do not bring their share of money, then the remaining amount that needs to be collected from the other 376 students is:

Rs. 176,560 - (32 students x Rs. 420 per student) = Rs. 149,840

Therefore, 32 students did not bring their share of money, leaving behind Rs. 149,840 that needs to be collected from the remaining 376 students."
Response:  If there are 479 students in total and 30 of them have already taken the exam, then the remaining number of students who will take the exam is 479 - 30 = 449.  Now, if we assume that 89% of the students (or 362 students) have given their consent to take the exam, then the number of students who have not given their consent is 449 - 362 = 87. Therefore, out of 479 students, 87 have not given their consent to take the exam.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students who took part in the survey. According to the question, out of 310 students, 185 gave their opinion about the quality of food provided in the canteen. So, the remaining 125 students did not give their opinion. Therefore, the total number of students involved in the survey is: 310 - 125 = 185. Now, let's find out how many students preferred the taste of beef. As per the given information, 90 students liked the taste of beef. So, the percentage of students who preferred the taste of beef is: (90/185) x 100% = 49%.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students who took part in the survey. According to the question, out of 288 students, 264 gave their opinion about the quality of food provided in the canteen. So, the remaining 24 students did not give their opinion. Therefore, the total number of students involved in the survey is:

Total number of students = Number of students who gave their opinion + Number of students who did not give their opinion
= 264 + 24
= 288

Now, let's find out how many students preferred the taste of the food provided in the canteen. According to the question, among the 264 students who gave their opinion, 130 students preferred the taste of the food. Therefore, the number of students who did not prefer the taste of the food is:

Number of students who did not prefer the taste of the food = Total number of students - Number of students who preferred the taste of the food
= 288 - 130
= 158

Finally, let's find out how many students thought that the price of the food was reasonable. According to the question, among the 264 students who gave their opinion, 174 students thought that the price of the food was reasonable. Therefore, the number of students who did not think that the price of the food was reasonable is:

Number of students who did not think that the price of the food was reasonable = Total number of students - Number of students who thought that the price of the food was reasonable
= 288 - 174
= 114

So, to answer your question, out of the 288 students involved in the survey, 130 students preferred the taste of the food, 158 students did not prefer the taste of the food, and 114 students thought that the price of the food was reasonable."
Response:  If 457 students have given suggestions for the menu and 63 of them are vegetarians, then among the total 457 students, 63 students (or 14%) are vegetarians. Therefore, out of the 80 students who gave suggestions for the menu, 12 students (or 15%) are vegetarians.
"Response:  If we have 182 students and each student has to give suggestions for 5 different subjects, then the total number of suggestions will be:

182 students x 5 subjects = 910 suggestions

Now, if 166 students suggest something in at least one subject, then the total number of suggestions will be:

910 suggestions - 166 students who suggested something in at least one subject = 744 suggestions

Therefore, there are approximately 744 suggestions given by the students."
Response:  If there are 324 students in total and they have to choose one of the following dishes for lunch - pizza, pasta, or tater tot casserole - then we can calculate the probability as follows:  For pizza, there are 374 options (324 students x 10 different types of pizza). So, the probability of choosing pizza is 374/856 = 0.439. Similarly, for pasta, there are 324 options (324 students x 10 different types of pasta), so the probability of choosing pasta is 324/856 = 0.381. And for tater tot casserole, there are 128 options (128 students x 1 type of tater tot casserole), so the probability of choosing tater tot casserole is 128/856 = 0.151. Therefore, among these three options, the most likely choice for the 324 students would be pizza with a probability of 0.439.
Response:  If we give 257 students a suggestion to eat only one type of food for lunch every day (either alu ko pizza or beken thapna), and if they follow this suggestion, then out of 120 students who prefer alu ko pizza, 97 will have eaten more than 120 times that food in total. So, among those 120 students, 97 will have eaten at least 120 x 97 = 11440 times that food. Similarly, among the remaining 37 students who preferred beken thapna, 37 will have eaten at least 37 x 120 = 4440 times that food. Therefore, the total number of times all 257 students have eaten their preferred food is: 11440 + 4440 = 15880 times.
Response:  If there are 144 students in total and they have to choose one of the following options - pizza, burgers, or tacos - then we can calculate the probability as follows:  For option A (pizza): 144 students x 0.25 = 36 students will choose pizza.  For option B (burgers): 144 students x 0.25 = 36 students will choose burgers.  For option C (tacos): 144 students x 0.25 = 36 students will choose tacos. So, among all the students, 36 students will choose pizza, 36 students will choose burgers, and 36 students will choose tacos. Therefore, the probability that a student chooses pizza is 36/144, which is approximately 0.25. Similarly, the probabilities for burgers and tacos are also approximately 0.25 each.
Response:  If we give 228 students a choice between pizza and tacos, and 337 of them choose pizza, then out of the remaining 228 students, if 105 choose tacos, that means 123 students chose neither pizza nor tacos. Therefore, among the total number of students (228 + 337), 164 students did not prefer either option.
"Response:  If there are 660 students and each student has to bring 38 kg of food, then the total weight of food that needs to be brought is:

660 students x 38 kg/student = 25740 kg

Now, if we divide this amount among the 450 students who have agreed to participate in the program, then each student will have to carry:

25740 kg / 450 students = 57.19 kg per student

So, out of the 450 students who have agreed to participate in the program, 380 students (88%) have carried their share of the load, while 70 students (12%) have not carried their share."
Response:  If we have 218 students and each student has to eat only one meal per day, then total number of meals required is 218. Now, if 351 students want to eat with their friends, then total number of meals required becomes 351 x 2 = 702 meals. So, out of these 702 meals, 218 meals are already taken care of by the school, leaving us with 484 meals.
Response:  If we give special preference to students who have studied in class X and XII, then out of 269 students, 330 students will get priority over others for admission. Among them, 76 students will be selected based on their merit. So, the total number of students who will get admission after giving special preference is 330 + 76 = 406 students.
Response:  We have 569 students in the school and 236 boys. So, the total number of students is 569 + 236 = 781. Now, if we add 10 more girls to the school, the new total number of students will be 781 + 10 = 791. Therefore, the number of girls increased by 10.
Response:  We have 34 girls and 84 boys in the school initially. If we add 20 new students to the school, including 10 girls and 10 boys, then the total number of girls will increase by 2 (from 34 to 36), and the total number of boys will increase by 10 (from 84 to 94). Therefore, the final number of girls in the school is 36, and the final number of boys is 94.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in the school and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is 253 (485 - 232). Therefore, the percentage of boys in the school is 51.7% (253/485 x 100%).
Response:  We know that there are currently 697 students in the school and 228 more students will join next year. So, the total number of students in the school after one year will be:  Total no. of students = Current no. of students + Newly admitted students = 697 + 228 = 925 students. Therefore, there will be 925 students in the school after one year.
Response:  We know that there are currently 635 students in the school and each student has brought 510 rupees as their share of the fundraising campaign. So, the total amount collected from all the students is: 635 students x 510 rupees per student = 324,750 rupees. Therefore, if an additional 510 rupees were contributed by each student, the total amount collected would be: 324,750 rupees + (510 x 635) = 498,775 rupees.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in the school and 281 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the school is:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls = 868 - 281 = 587 boys.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 students in each class and there are 142 classes in total. So, the number of students in the school is:

Number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class
= 142 x 7
= 954

So, there are 954 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in the school and 223 boys. So, the total number of students is 706 + 223 = 929. Now, we need to find out how many girls are studying in the school. Since 480 girls have enrolled, the number of girls studying in the school is 480. Therefore, the number of students studying in the school is 929 (boys) + 480 (girls) = 1409.
Response:  We know that there are 920 students in the school and 811 boys. So, the number of girls is:  Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 920 - 811 = 109 Therefore, there are 109 girls in the school.
Response:  We have:  Number of students in school = 632  Number of boys in school = 410  Total number of students in school = 632 + 410 = 1042 Now, we need to find out how many more girls than boys are there in the school. So, let's subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: Number of girls in school = Total number of students - Number of boys = 1042 - 410 = 632 Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 632.
Response:  We know that in one school there are 732 students and 761 teachers. In another school, there are 682 students and 8 janitors. To find out how many students there are in the second school, we can subtract the number of teachers from the total number of students: 682 - 761 = -79 Students do not exist in the second school. Therefore, the number of students in the first school is greater than or equal to 79. So, the answer is 732 or more.
Response:  In one school, there are 135 students and 214 teachers. If all the students in that school have brought lunch, then the total number of people who have brought lunch from that school is:  Number of students x Number of students bringing lunch = 135 x 910 = 120,550  So, the number of people who have brought lunch from that school is approximately 120,550.
Response:  We know that there are 308 students in the school and 318 boys. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now, we need to find out how many students are girls. Since there are 308 girls among the total number of students, the number of boys is equal to the total number of students minus the number of girls, which is 626 - 308 = 318. Therefore, there are 318 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 students in the school and 309 teachers. Now, we need to find out how many students are taught by each teacher. To do this, we divide the number of teachers (309) by the total number of students (315). So, each teacher teaches an average of 315/309 = 1 student. Therefore, there are 315 students in the school who are taught by 772 teachers.
"Response:  If there are currently 402 students in the school and it increased by 739 students, then the new number of students in the school is:

New Number of Students = Old Number of Students + Increase
= 402 + 739
= 1141

Therefore, there are 1141 students in the school now."
"Response:  If there are currently 458 students in the school and it has increased by 692 students, then the total number of students in the school now is:

Total number of students = Current number of students + Increase in students
= 458 + 692
= 1140

So, there are 1140 students in the school now."
Response:  We have:  Number of students in school = 362 boys + 257 girls = 619 students Total number of students who passed = 403 students Now, let's find out how many more students passed than there were in total number of students in the school: Difference between total number of students and number of students who passed = Total number of students - Number of students who passed = 619 - 403 = 216 students Therefore, the number of more students who passed than there were in total number of students in the school is 216 students.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Edvard has $18 and he spent $16. So, his remaining amount of money is:

$18 - $16 = $2

Therefore, Edvard has $2 left after spending $16."
Response:  Firstly, $13 was spent and then $3 was added to it. So, the total amount of money that Edward has now is : $13 + $3 = $16.
Response:  Firstly, Edvard spent $90 and then he got $8 back. So, his new amount of money is $82. Now, he has $17 left with him. Therefore, the amount of money that Edvard had before spending $90 is $17.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $16 was spent on books and each book cost $92. So, the total number of books purchased is $\frac{16}{92} = \boxed{0.175}$ books. Now, since there are $\boxed{6}$ dollars left after buying the books, the amount of money spent on each book is $\boxed{\frac{16}{0.175}} = \boxed{92}$. Therefore, the amount of money spent on each book is $92$.
Response:  We have been given that $6 was spent on each of the 2 books. So, the total amount spent on both the books is $6 x 2 = $12. Now, we are asked to find out how much each book costs. To do this, we can divide the total amount spent ($12) by the number of books (2). Therefore, each book costs $\frac{12}{2} = $6.
Response:  Firstly, Edvard has $60 in his wallet and spends $16 on a book. So he is left with $44. Then, he gets $19 more, making it $63 in total. Therefore, the amount of money Edvard has now is $63.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $4 book and $3 pen cost together $7. Now, Edvard has $12 in total. So, how much did he pay for the book and pen separately? Book Cost = $4 x $12 = $48 Pen Cost = $3 x $12 = $36 Total Cost = Book Cost + Pen Cost = $48 + $36 = $84 Therefore, Edvard paid $84 for the book and pen.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $16 book cost and $8 were spent on it. Now, there is $19 left. So, if we want to find out how much more was spent on the book than the original price, we can subtract the amount spent from the original price: $19 - $8 = $11. Therefore, the book cost $11 more than its original price.
Response:  Advertisement cost $17, and they earned $10 from their friend. Now, they have $7 left. So, the amount of money that Edward lost is $10 - $7 = $3.
Response:  We know that Jacharile has 44 vats of ghee and Debidale has 58 pots of water. Now we need to find out how many pots of water Debidale has after mixing with Jacharile's ghee. Since 1 vat of ghee is equal to 4 pots of water, so Debidale will have 232 pots of water (58 x 4) after mixing with Jacharile's ghee. Therefore, the total number of pots of water that both Jacharile and Debidale have after mixing their resources is 232 + 58 = 290 pots of water.
Response:  We know that Jacharile has 51 votes and Debidale has 44 votes. To find out how many more votes Debidale got than Jacharile, we need to subtract the number of votes Debidale had from the number of votes Jacharile had. So, the difference between their vote counts is: 44 - 51 = -7. Therefore, Debidale got 7 fewer votes than Jacharile.
Response:  We know that Debidale has scored 44 wickets in his last 9 matches and Jakaarthi has taken 9 wickets in his last 5 matches. So, we can calculate the average number of wickets taken per match for each player as follows:  For Debidale: Average = (44/9) = 5 wickets per match  For Jakaarthi: Average = (9/5) = 1.8 wickets per match Now, let's compare their averages to find out who took more wickets per match. Since Debidale's average is higher than Jakaarthi's, we can conclude that Debidale took more wickets per match than Jakaarthi. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Debidale.
Response:  We know that Debidale did 51 push-ups today and Jakaari did 49 push-ups today. So, the total number of push-ups done by both is:  Debidale + Jakaari = 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups. Therefore, the total number of push-ups done by both is 100.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many vats of water were poured into the pot and how much water was left in the pot after pouring.  From the question, we know that 59 vats of water were poured into the pot and 44 vats of water were left in the pot after pouring. So, the total amount of water poured into the pot is 59 + 44 = 103 vats. Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of vats poured and the number of vats left in the pot. The difference is 103 - 44 = 69 vats. Therefore, Debidale poured 69 vats of water into the pot.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much water is required for each plant. For this, we need to know the volume of soil in which each plant is grown. From the given information, we can see that there are 44 vats of potatoes and 17 vats of carrots. So, the total volume of soil used for growing these vegetables is:

For potatoes: Volume of soil = Number of vats x Volume of onevat
= 44 vats x 20 liters/vat = 880 liters

For carrots: Volume of soil = Number of vats x Volume of onevat
= 17 vats x 30 liters/vat = 510 liters

Now, let's calculate the amount of water required for each plant based on their respective volumes of soil:

Water requirement for potatoes (in liters) = Volume of soil x Water content of soil (%)
= 880 liters x 20% = 176 liters

Water requirement for carrots (in liters) = Volume of soil x Water content of soil (%)
= 510 liters x 20% = 102 liters

Next, we need to find out how much water was actually applied to the plants. According to the question, 29 vats of water were added to the pots, but only 13 vats were enough for the carrots. Therefore, the difference between the actual water applied and the required water is:

Difference in water application (in liters) = Actual water applied - Required water
= 29 vats - 13 vats = 16 liters

Finally, we can calculate the number of patters needed to supply the required water as follows:

Number of pumps needed = Total water requirement / Amount of water supplied
= 176 liters / 16 liters = 11 pumps

Therefore, according to the given information, 11 pumps would be needed to supply the required amount of water to the plants."
Response:  We know that 53 vats of push-up and 14 vats of crunches were done today. Debidale did 17 more vats of push-ups than crunches. So, the difference between the number of vats of push-ups and crunches is 17 vats. Therefore, the number of vats of push-ups done today is 53 - 17 = 36 vats.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 87 crunches today.  So, we can calculate his total number of repetitions as follows: Push-ups = 35 Crunches = 87 Total repetitions = 35 + 87 = 122 Now, let's compare it with his goal of doing at least 100 repetitions in one day. Since he has done 122 repetitions today, which is more than his goal, we can say that Zachary has achieved his goal. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) He exceeded his goal.
Response:  We know that Zachary scored 46 points in push-ups and 58 points in crunches. He also did 38 push-ups more than Deborah. So, we can calculate his score as follows: Zachary's total score = Push-up score + Crunch score - Difference between Deborah's scores (Push-ups + Crunches) Now let's substitute the values given in the question: Zachary's total score = 46 + 58 - (38 + 62) = 176 points Therefore, Zachary scored 176 points.
Response:  We know that 19 vats of water were poured into the pot and it increased to 39 pots after boiling. So, the increase in volume is 20 pots (39 - 19). Now, we need to find out how many pots Jon filled with water before boiling. According to the question, Jon filled 13 pots with water before boiling. Therefore, the difference between the number of pots filled by Deb and Jon is 7 pots (39 - 13).
Response:  We know that 51 pats were pushed up by Jack and 22 pats were pushed down by Debbie. So, the total number of pats moved by both is 51 + 22 = 73 pats. Now, we are asked how many pats John moved. Since John moved 4 pats less than Debbie, John moved 73 - 4 = 69 pats. Therefore, John moved 69 pats.
Response:  We know that Jacharile has 15 push-ups today and Debidale has 39 push-ups today.  Jonle has done 9 less push-ups than Debidale. So, Jonle has done 20 push-ups today.
Response:  We know that Debidale has scored 30 points in the first quarter and 37 points in the second quarter, so he has scored a total of 67 points in the first half (30 + 37 = 67). Now, we need to find out how many points Debidale will score in the third quarter if he scores 30 points more than his previous quarter's score. So, if Debidale scored 37 points in the second quarter, then he will score 30 points more than 37, which is equal to 67 points (37 + 30 = 67). Therefore, Debidale will score 67 points in the third quarter.
Response:  We know that Debidale has scored 56 runs in 38 overs and has faced 38 balls. Now we need to find out how many runs he would have scored if he had played for 50 overs (which is equal to 150 balls). So, let's calculate his average score per over: Average Score = Total Runs / Number of Overs = 56 / 50 = 1.12 runs/over Now, let's assume that Debidale continued playing for another 4 overs (equal to 12 balls) after scoring 56 runs. In this case, he would have scored an additional 1.12 x 4 = 4.48 runs. Therefore, Debidale's total score after playing for 50 overs would be 56 + 4.48 = 60.48 runs.
Response:  We know that Debidale has 40 watermelons and he gave away 17 watermelons to Jhimkaarthy. So, Debidale has 23 watermelons left (40 - 17 = 23). Now, we are told that Jhimkaarthy received 34 watermelons from someone else and gave away 62 watermelons. So, Jhimkaarthy has 34 + 62 = 96 watermelons. Therefore, the difference between the number of watermelons Debidale had and the number of watermelons Jhimkaarthy had is 96 - 23 = 73 watermelons.
Response:  If Debidale has 36 watermelons and sells 20 at a profit of Rs. 58 each, then he will have 16 watermelons left after selling them. Now if he wants to sell 33 more watermelons at a loss of Rs. 4 each, how many watermelons will he be able to sell? Solution: To find out how many watermelons Debidale can sell at a loss of Rs. 4 each, we need to subtract the cost price from the selling price. The cost price of one watermelon is Rs. 58, so the selling price would be Rs. 58 - Rs. 4 = Rs. 54 per watermelon. Since Debidale wants to sell 33 more watermelons, he will be able to sell 33 x Rs. 54 = Rs. 1792 worth of watermelons at a loss of Rs. 4 each. Therefore, Debidale will be able to sell 33 + 16 = 49 watermelons in total.
Response:  We know that Debidale has 27 vats of rice and he wants to sell it at Rs. 10 per vat. If he sells 7 vats today, then he will get Rs. 700 (7 x 10 = 70). Now, if Jakaarthi buys 5 vats from him at Rs. 8 per vat, then Jakaarthi will pay Rs. 40 (5 x 8 = 40) to Debidale. So, after this transaction, Debidale will have Rs. 660 left (Rs. 700 - Rs. 40 = Rs. 660).
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of mathematics book and how many pages of general knowledge book are needed for Rahul to complete his homework completely.  Since Rahul can read two pages of general knowledge book in one hour, he will take 5 hours to finish reading all 10 pages of that book. So, the time taken to read the entire book is :  Time = Number of pages / Reading speed (in pages per hour) = 10 pages / 2 pages/hour = 5 hours  Similarly, since Rahul can solve five problems of mathematics book in one hour, it will take him 2 hours to solve all 25 problems of that book. Therefore, the time taken to solve the entire book is : Time = Number of problems / Solving speed (in problems per hour) = 25 problems / 5 problems/hour = 5 hours  Now, let's calculate the total time required to complete both books together : Total time = Time taken to read general knowledge book + Time taken to solve mathematics book = 5 hours + 5 hours = 10 hours  Therefore, according to the given information, Rahul needs 10 hours to complete his homework completely.
Response:  We have three students who can do math problems and four students who can read books. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 students. Now, let's assume that each student can perform one task at a time. Therefore, the maximum number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously is 7.
Response:  If there are 5 students and each student has to complete 7 homework assignments, then the total number of homework assignments that need to be completed is 5 x 7 = 35. So, out of these 35 homework assignments, if 4 students can complete 10 assignments each, then the remaining 10 assignments will have to be completed by 1 student. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If we have to solve 7 pages of mathematics homework in 4 hours, then we will have to complete one page every hour. So, if we start solving the first page at 3 PM, then we will finish it by 4 PM (1 hour). Now, we have only 3 hours left to solve the remaining 6 pages. Therefore, to complete all 7 pages within 4 hours, we need to work at an average rate of 1 page per hour.
Response:  If we have to complete all eight chapters of mathematics homework in 30 minutes, then each chapter will take approximately 4 minutes to complete (8 chapters x 4 minutes per chapter = 32 minutes). Now, if we have completed three chapters so far and there are five remaining chapters, then the total time taken to complete those five chapters will be 5 x 4 = 20 minutes (since we already spent 32 minutes completing the first three chapters). Therefore, the total time taken to complete all eight chapters is 32 + 20 = 52 minutes.
Response:  If we have 8 pages of math problems and each page has 6 problems, then we have a total of 8 x 6 = 48 math problems. Now, if we want to know how many pages it would take to complete all 48 math problems, we can divide 48 by 6 (the number of problems per page). This gives us approximately 8 pages. So, it would take around 8 pages to complete all 48 math problems.
Response:  If Rahul can complete 10 pages of mathematics in 3 hours, then he will be able to complete 1 page every hour. So, if he has to complete 30 pages (which is equal to 3 times 10 pages), it means that he will take 3 hours to complete them. Therefore, the total time taken to complete all 30 pages will be 3 x 3 = 9 hours.
Response:  For part (a), we have to find out how many pages of each book are needed to complete the total number of pages required for both books.  Book 1 has 200 pages, and we need 3 pages from it to complete the total number of pages required for both books. So, the number of pages of Book 1 that we need is 200 / 3 = 67 pages.  Similarly, for Book 2, we need 40 pages to complete the total number of pages required for both books. Therefore, the number of pages of Book 2 that we need is 40 / 3 = 13 pages.  Now, let's add the number of pages of both Books 1 and 2 that we need: 67 + 13 = 80 pages.  Hence, the answer is 80 pages.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pages of each subject are required to complete the total number of pages given in the question.  Mathematics has 9 chapters and each chapter contains approximately 20-30 questions, so we can assume an average of 25 questions per chapter.  Therefore, the total number of questions in mathematics is:

9 chapters x 25 questions/chapter = 225 questions

Now, let's consider the time taken to solve each question. Assuming that it takes around 1 minute to solve each question (which may vary depending on the complexity of the question), then the total time taken to solve all the questions in mathematics is:

225 questions x 60 seconds/minute = 13,500 seconds

Similarly, for Biology, there are 7 chapters with approximately 20-30 questions per chapter, resulting in a total of:

7 chapters x 25 questions/chapter = 175 questions

Assuming a similar time duration of 1 minute per question, the total time taken to solve all the questions in Biology is:

175 questions x 60 seconds/minute = 10,500 seconds

Therefore, if you want to read through both subjects equally thoroughly, you would need to spend approximately:

Mathematics: 13,500 seconds / 2 = 6,750 minutes or 108 hours
Biology: 10,500 seconds / 2 = 5,250 minutes or 84 hours

So, to cover both subjects equally thoroughly, you would need to spend around 108 hours reading through Mathematics and 84 hours reading through Biology."
"Response:  We have to find out how many pages of mathematics and biology books are needed for each student to complete their homework fully.  For this, we need to divide the total number of pages in both subjects' textbooks by the number of students.  The total number of pages in mathematics and biology textbooks is given as 110 pages.  If there are 20 students, then the number of pages per student would be:

Pages per student = Total pages / Number of students
= 110 pages / 20 students
= 5.5 pages per student (approximately)
Now, let's assume that each student needs to read 3 pages of mathematics and 2 pages of biology every day to complete their homework fully. So, the total number of days required to complete the homework fully would be:
Days required = Total pages / Reading speed (pages/day)
= 5.5 pages/student x 20 students
= 110 days (approximately)"
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of each subject (Mathematics and Biology) are required to complete the homework fully.  For Mathematics, we need 11 pages to complete the homework fully, as there are 7 questions in total and each question requires approximately 2 pages to write answers. Therefore, the total number of pages needed for Mathematics is 11. Similarly, for Biology, we need 8 pages to complete the homework fully, as there are 5 questions in total and each question requires approximately 1 page to write answers. Therefore, the total number of pages needed for Biology is 8. So, the difference between the number of pages needed for Mathematics and Biology is 3 (11 - 8 = 3).
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of each subject (Mathematics and General Knowledge) are required to complete the entire curriculum for Classes 1-8.  For Mathematics, we need 9 books with an average of 20 pages per book, so the total number of pages is: 9 x 20 = 180 pages.  Similarly, for General Knowledge, we need 29 books with an average of 4 pages per book, so the total number of pages is: 29 x 4 = 116 pages. Therefore, in total, we require 180 + 116 = 306 pages to complete the entire curriculum for Classes 1-8.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of each subject (Mathematics and Biology) are required to complete their homework fully.  For Mathematics, we need 7 pages for completing all the homework given in the question.  For Biology, we also need 7 pages for completing all the homework given in the question. Therefore, the total number of pages needed to complete both subjects' homework is 14 pages (7 + 7).
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of each subject (Mathematics and Biology) are required for 10 students to complete their homework fully.  Mathematics has 5 chapters with 2 pages per chapter, so it requires 10 x 5 = 50 pages in total. Similarly, Biology has 6 chapters with 3 pages per chapter, so it requires 10 x 6 = 60 pages in total. Therefore, we need 50 + 60 = 110 pages of homework for all 10 students to complete fully.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of mathematics and science books are needed for each student in order to complete their homework fully.  For this, we need to divide the total number of pages of both subjects' books by the number of students.  The total number of pages of mathematics and science books is given as 200 pages. If there are 4 students, then the number of pages per student will be: 200 pages / 4 students = 50 pages per student. Therefore, each student needs 50 pages of mathematics or science book to complete their homework fully.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of each subject are needed for 7 students and 19 books.  For mathematics, we need 7 x 4 = 28 pages.  For science, we need 19 x 3 = 57 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages required is 28 + 57 = 85 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 6 emails in total and we have already received 2 emails so far. So, the remaining number of emails to be received is 6 - 2 = 4. Now, let's assume that each email takes an average time of 1 hour to arrive. Therefore, the total time taken for all 4 emails to arrive will be 4 x 1 hour = 4 hours.
"Response:  We know that Bihān has received 6 emails and Dīunso has received 8 emails. So, we can calculate the difference between their email counts as follows:

Difference = 8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, the number of additional emails that Dīunso received compared to Bihān is 2."
Response:  If Bihān has received 4 emails in total and he wants to know how many emails he will receive if he continues to receive an average of 5 emails per day, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of days = Total number of emails / Average number of emails per day = 4 emails / 5 emails/day = 0.8 days So, Bihān will receive approximately 0.8 emails per day.
Response:  We know that there are 6 emails in total and we have received 3 so far. So, the remaining number of emails is 6 - 3 = 3. Now, each day we receive 5 new emails, so the number of emails we will receive tomorrow is 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Bihān has sent 5 emails and Dīunso has received 8 emails. So, there is a difference of 3 emails between them (5 - 8 = -3). Now, we need to find out how many emails Jyākale has sent or received. Since Jyākale has not mentioned anything about sending or receiving any emails, we can assume that he/she has neither sent nor received any email. Therefore, the answer is (-3) x 100 = -300%.
Response:  We know that there are 4 emails in Bihar and 5 emails in Delhi. So, the total number of emails received from both places is: 4 + 5 = 9 emails. Now, we need to find out how many emails were received from each place separately. From Bihar, 3 emails were received (as mentioned in the question). And from Delhi, 5 emails were received. Therefore, the total number of emails received from Bihar and Delhi separately is: 3 + 5 = 8 emails.
Response:  We know that Bihān has sent 3 emails and received 4 emails. So, there is a difference of -1 email between them. Now, let's consider Saṃjha's situation. He has sent 8 emails and received 6 emails, so there is a difference of 2 emails between them. Therefore, the number of emails that Bihān has received from Saṃjha is 2 emails.
Response:  We have 10 emails in total. Out of them, 7 are received and 3 are sent. So, the number of unread emails is 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 unread emails left after 7 days.
Response:  We know that Jyakale has received 9 emails from Bihan and sent 10 emails to him. So, there is no difference in the number of emails he has received and sent. Now, let's consider the time frame of the emails. Bihan sent 7 emails during the daytime, while Jyakale received 4 emails during the night. Therefore, the total number of emails exchanged between them during the night is 4 + 7 = 11 emails.
Response:  We have 10 emails to send and we sent 5 emails in the first round. So, there are remaining 5 emails left to be sent. In the second round, we sent 4 more emails, so now we have sent a total of 9 emails (5 + 4 = 9). Therefore, the number of emails that were successfully delivered is 9 - 5 = 4.
Response:  If Jyakale received 6 emails in total and he replied to 3 of them, then he must have sent 3 emails that were not replied to. So, if he sent 10 emails in total, then he must have received 7 emails (6 - 3 = 7).
Response:  We know that there are 3 emails and 64 letters in total. So, we can calculate the number of emails received per day as follows: Number of emails received = Total number of emails / Number of days taken to receive all emails = 3/7 = 0.42857 (approximately 1 email per day) Similarly, we can calculate the number of letters received per day as follows: Number of letters received = Total number of letters / Number of days taken to receive all letters = 64/7 = 9 (approximately 9 letters per day) Therefore, based on the given information, Jyakale received approximately 1 email per day and approximately 9 letters per day.
Response:  If Jyakale received 5 emails and 6 letters in one day, then he received a total of 11 messages (5 emails + 6 letters) that day.
Response:  We know that 10 emails and 12 letters were received in total.  Of these, 3 emails and 44 letters were received from Jack alone. So, to find out how many emails Jack sent, we need to subtract the number of emails he received from the total number of emails received. Therefore, the number of emails Jack sent is:  Number of emails Jack sent = Total number of emails received - Number of emails received from Jack  = 10 - 3 = 7 Emails.
Response:  At first, there were 6 emails and 8 letters received. Then, Jyakale reduced them to 2 emails and 7 letters. So, in total, Jyakale reduced 4 (6 - 2) emails and 5 (8 - 7) letters. Therefore, the number of emails and letters that Jyakale received after reducing them is 2 + 5 = 7 emails and 7 + 5 = 12 letters.
Response:  We know that Jyakale received 6 emails and replied to 91 of them. So, he sent out 2 emails for every email he received. Therefore, the number of emails Jyakale sent in one day is:  Number of emails sent = Total number of emails received / Number of emails replied to x Number of emails sent per reply = 6 / 91 x 2 = 13 Emails per day
Response:  If Jyakale received 4 emails and read 2 of them, then he has 6 unread emails left (4 - 2 = 6). Now, if he received another 8 emails and read 6 of them, then he has 2 unread emails left (8 - 6 = 2). Therefore, Jyakale reads an average of 1 email every day (2 / 1 = 1).
Response:  If he received 9 emails in total and he replied to 7 of them, then there are remaining 2 emails that he did not reply to. So, the number of unread emails is 2.
Response:  We know that 3 emails were received in Bihar and 5 emails were sent from Bihar. So, the difference between the number of emails received and sent is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, the number of emails that Jyakale did not receive is 16 - 2 = 14.
Response:  If Jyakale received 3 emails in Bihar and 6 emails in Saurashtra, then he received a total of 9 emails (3 + 6 = 9).  Now, if he received 10 more emails after that, then he received a total of 19 emails (9 + 10 = 19).
Response:  We know that Tiddlywinkles have 9 inches and Bhyaagutales have 12 inches. So, if we want to find out how many Tiddlywinks can fit in one Bhyaagu, we need to divide the length of Bhyaagu (12 inches) by the length of Tiddlywinkle (9 inches). This gives us 1.33 Tiddlywinks per Bhyaagu. Therefore, the answer is 1.33.
Response:  Tiddlywinkles have 31 inches and Bhyaagutales have 35 inches. So, if we calculate the total length of both, it will be: Total length = (31 + 35) = 66 inches. Therefore, the correct answer is 66 inches.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 36 appears in both sets of numbers given in the question. We can see that in set A, the number 36 appears once, and in set B, it appears twice. So, the total number of times 36 appears in both sets is 2 + 1 = 3. Now, let's find out how many times the number 17 appears in both sets. In set A, the number 17 appears once, and in set B, it appears thrice. So, the total number of times 17 appears in both sets is 1 + 3 = 4. Similarly, we can find out the number of times each number appears in both sets as follows: Set A: 36 - 1 = 35, 17 - 1 = 16; Set B: 36 - 2 = 34, 17 - 3 = 14. Therefore, the difference between the number of times 36 appears in both sets and the number of times 17 appears in both sets is: 35 - 14 = 21."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of inches in all three categories - Tiddi, Bhayaguta and Musale.  For Tiddi, there are 25 inches. For Bhayaguta, there are 18 inches. And for Musale, there are 2 inches. Therefore, the total number of inches is: 25 + 18 + 2 = 45 inches. So, the correct answer is 45 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that टिड्डी (Tiddi) got 19 inches in height. Then,  Bhygutta received 10 inches of Tittur. Musalle also got 20 inches of Tittur. Chuuhle got 39 inches of Tittur. So, the total amount of Tittur distributed among all four is: 19 + 10 + 20 + 39 = 88 inches. Therefore, Chuuhle got the most number of inches of Tittur, which is 39 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that टिड्डी (Tiddi) has scored 19 innings in cricket.  Secondly, we know that Bhagutai has scored 39 innings in cricket. Lastly, we know that Musale has scored 94 innings in cricket. Now, let's calculate the average score of each player: टिटुरले (Tituri): Average = Total Innings / Number of Fours Scored = 19 x 4 = 76  Bhygutai (Bhagutai): Average = Total Innings / Number of Fours Scored = 39 x 4 = 156  Musale (Musale): Average = Total Innings / Number of Fours Scored = 94 x 4 = 376 Therefore, among these three players, Musale has scored the highest number of fours with an average of 376, followed by Bhygutai with an average of 156 and Tituri with an average of 76.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiddi has scored 25 innings. Bhayaguta has scored 32 innings more than Tiddi. So, Bhayaguta has scored 32 + 25 = 57 innings. Musale has scored 26 innings less than Bhayaguta. Therefore, Musale has scored 57 - 26 = 31 innings.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiddi had 24 inches of height and Bhayaguta had 33 inches of height. So, their difference in height is 9 inches (33 - 24 = 9). Now, Musale had 5 inches less than Bhayaguta, so his height was 33 - 5 = 28 inches. Therefore, Chuahle's height was 28 inches.
"Response:  We know that Tiddlywink has 13 innings and Titur has 2 innings. So, we can calculate the average number of overs per inning as follows:

Tiddlywink - 13 x 6 = 78 overs
Titur - 2 x 6 = 12 overs
Now, let's find out how many overs Titur bowled in one inning:

Titur bowled 12 overs in his first inning.
So, the total number of overs Titur bowled in both innings is:

12 + 12 = 24 overs
Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Titur bowled 24 overs in two innings."
Response:  We have two numbers given in the question: 35 and 4. Now we need to find out how many times 4 can be divided into 35. To do this, we divide 4 by 35: 4 / 35 = 0.114286 (round off to one decimal place). So, there are approximately 11 parts of 4 that fit into 35. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  Firstly, we know that टिड्डी (Tiddi) got 19 inches in height and  Bhhyaguta got 4 inches less than Tiddi i.e., 15 inches. So, Bhhyaguta's height is 15 inches.  Now, let's find out how many times Bhhyaguta's height is equal to Tiddi's height. We can do this by dividing Bhhyaguta's height by Tiddi's height.  Bhhyaguta's height / Tiddi's height = 15/19 = 0.7368421052631578  Therefore, Bhhyaguta is 0.7368421052631578 times shorter than Tiddi.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiddi has scored 39 innings out of 40 in cricket. So, his average score per inning is:

$ \frac{39}{40} = \boxed{0.975}$ $ (rounded to two decimal places)$

Now, let's consider Bhayagutta and Musale. We know that Bhayagutta scored 19 innings less than Tiddi, which means he scored $\boxed{31}$ innings. Similarly, Musale scored $\boxed{28}$ innings less than Tiddi, which means he scored $\boxed{12}$ innings.

So, the total number of innings played by all three players can be calculated as follows:

Tiddi - $\boxed{40}$
Bhayagutta - $\boxed{31}$
Musale - $\boxed{12}$
Total - $\boxed{83}$

Now, let's calculate the average score per inning for each player:

For Tiddi: $\frac{\boxed{39}}{40} = \boxed{0.975}$

For Bhayagutta: $\frac{\boxed{31}}{39} = \boxed{0.775}$

For Musale: $\frac{\boxed{12}}{39} = \boxed{0.305}$

Finally, to find out who scored the most runs among them, we need to compare their averages:

Tiddi's average score per inning is higher than both Bhayagutta and Musale, so he scored the most runs among them. Therefore, the answer is:

$ \boxed{Tiddi} $"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiddi has scored 21 innings in cricket. Secondly, we know that Bhayagutta has scored 25 innings in cricket. Lastly, we know that Musalle has scored 16 innings in cricket. Now, let's calculate the average score of each player: Tiddi - (21 x 5) / 4 = 10.75 Bhayagutta - (25 x 5) / 4 = 13.75 Musalle - (16 x 5) / 4 = 9.5 Now, to find out who is the best batsman among them, we need to compare their averages. The highest average score belongs to Bhayagutta, so he is the best batsman among the three. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Bhayagutta.
Response:  We know that Tiddi has 39 inches and Titur has 17 inches. So, if we want to find out how many times Titur can fit inside Tiddi, we need to divide the length of Titur (17 inches) by the length of Tiddi (39 inches).  Therefore, Titur can fit inside Tiddi approximately 2.4 times.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of inch units for each category:  * For Tiddi, there are 9 inches per unit. So, the total number of inches = 9 x 7 = 63 inches.  * For Bhayagutta, there are 3 inches per unit. So, the total number of inches = 3 x 5 = 15 inches.  * For Musalle, there are 33 inches per unit. So, the total number of inches = 33 x 4 = 132 inches. Now, let's find out how many times Musalle is more than Tiddi: 132 inches (Musalle) / 63 inches (Tiddi) = 2.03 times more than Tiddi. Therefore, Mausoleum is approximately 2.03 times larger than Tiddi in terms of height.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of years that Tiddi had studied. According to the question, he studied for 14 innings. Therefore, the total number of years = 14 x 3 months/inning = 42 months. Now, let's calculate the total number of years that Bhayagutta and Musalle studied together. According to the question, they studied for 6 innings, which is equal to 6 x 3 months/inning = 18 months. Finally, let's calculate the difference between the total number of years that Tiddi and Chuuhle studied and the total number of years that Bhayagutta and Musalle studied together. The difference = Total number of years studied by Tiddi and Chuuhle - Total number of years studied by Bhayagutta and Musalle = 42 months - 18 months = 24 months. So, Chuuhle studied for the least number of months among all four friends.
Response:  We have to make 14 cups of tea and we need 6 cups of water for that. So, we will use 2 x 6 = 12 cups of water. Since we already used 5 cups of water earlier, we still have 7 cups of water left (12 - 5 = 7). Therefore, we will need an additional 3 cups of water (7 / 3 = 3) to make all 14 cups of tea.
Response:  Meri has 9 cups of rice and wants to distribute them equally among 11 people. So, each person will get 0.86 cups (9/11) of rice. Now, there are 4 cups left over after distributing them equally. Therefore, the number of cups that Abhi can have is 4 - 0.86 = 3.14 cups.
Response:  Meri has 6 cups of rice and wants to make 13 cups of chowmein. She already has 8 cups of water. To calculate how much more water she needs, we need to subtract the amount of water she already has from the total amount needed for chowmein. So, the difference between 13 cups (required) and 8 cups (available) is 5 cups. Therefore, Meri needs an additional 5 cups of water to make 13 cups of chowmein.
Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun daile 11 cups of water and 7 cups of tea are required. If they have already taken some water earlier, let's assume they took 3 cups of water before coming here. So, now they need 8 cups of water (11 - 3 = 8). Similarly, if they drank 2 cups of tea earlier, they still need 5 cups of tea (7 - 2 = 5). Therefore, they will need 8 + 5 = 13 cups of liquid in total.
Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun daile chhainda. (My brother has eaten 11 cups of rice.) Now we have to calculate how many cups of lentils he needs. According to the conversation, your brother needs 3 cups of lentils. So, if he has already eaten 11 cups of rice, then he still needs 8 cups of lentils.
Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun daile 12 cap ata ra chhainda. (They have 12 caps.) Now, they want to know how many cups of tea they can make with 5 cups of water and 3 cups of milk. So, if we divide 5 cups of water by 3 cups of milk, we get 1.67 cups of tea per cup of water. Therefore, they will be able to make 1.67 x 5 = 8.35 cups of tea in total.
Response:  Meri has 9 cups of rice and wants to distribute them equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 9/5 = 1.8 cups of rice. Now, there are 3 cups of dal left over after distributing the rice, so each person will get (3/5) = 0.62 cups of dal. Since there are 72 cups of chini in total, each person will get (72/5) = 14.4 cups of chini. Therefore, Katil needs 14.4 + 1.8 + 0.62 = 16.82 cups of food.
Response:  We have been given that Meri has 5 kg of atta and wants to make 14 chapatis. Each chapati requires 200 grams of Atta. So, we need to calculate how much atta is required for making 14 chapatis.  Number of chapatis = 14 Chapati weight in atta = 200 g/chapati x Number of chapatis = 30 kg (5 kg / 200 g) Therefore, out of 5 kg of atta, Meri will be able to make approximately 30 chapatis.
Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun daile chahinne cha (I have 12 cups of rice). Nu skhaamaa 12 cup daal, 5 cup chiini rae 49 cup nune chahinne chah (We need 13 cups of lentils, 5 cups of wheat flour, and 49 cups of salt). They have 11 cups of dal left (Mere le ke kek pakaun daile hauleki chah). So they need 2 more cups of dal.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice are required to make 10 kgs of biryani.  Since 1 cup of uncooked rice weighs approximately 200 grams, we can calculate the number of cups of uncooked rice needed as follows:

Number of cups of uncooked rice = Total weight of rice / Weight of one cup of uncooked rice
= 10 kg / 200 g
= 50 cups (approximately)

Now, let's consider that 2 cups of water are added for every cup of uncooked rice during cooking. So, to prepare 10 kgs of biryani, we would need:

Total volume of water = Number of cups of uncooked rice x Volume of water per cup of uncooked rice
= 50 cups x 2 cups/cup
= 100 liters (approximately)

Therefore, to make 10 kgs of biryani, you will require around 50 cups of uncooked rice and 100 liters of water."
Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun daile . 12 cups of rice, 14 cups of chickpeas and 7 cups of lentils are needed. If we had 2 cups of dal in advance, how much more do we need now? So, we need an additional 9 cups of lentils ( 2 - 12 = 9 )
Response:  We have been given that Meri has 6 cups of dal, 8 cups of rice, and 7 cups of lentils. She wants to distribute them equally among 5 people. So, we need to find out how many cups each person will get. Now, let's calculate it:  Total amount of food = 6 + 8 + 7 = 21 cups Food distribution ratio = Number of people / Total amount of food = 5 / 21 = 0.236 (or approximately 1/4) Therefore, each person will get approximately 1/4 cup of dal, 1/4 cup of rice, and 1/4 cup of lentils.
Response:  We have been given that Meri has 12 cups of rice and wants to make 13 cups of chicken curry. So far so good! Now, we are told that she has 2 cups of chicken left after making the curry. That means she used 10 cups of chicken (13 - 2 = 10). Therefore, the number of cups of chicken required for the recipe is 10 cups.
Response:  We have been given that Meri has 9 cups of dal and 6 cups of chini. She wants to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 2 cups of dal and 1 cup of chini. Now, we need to find out how many cups of chini are left after distributing 4 cups among 4 people. Therefore, the number of cups of chini left is 6 - (4 x 1) = 6 - 4 = 2 cups.
Response:  We have to make 6 cups of tea using 9 cups of water and 2 cups of dal. So, we need 3 more cups of water to make the remaining 3 cups of tea. Therefore, the required number of cups of water is 3 + 6 = 9 cups.
Response:  Meri has given 5 cups of rice and 14 cups of lentils to Abhi. Now, Abhi has only 11 cups of lentils left. To find out how many cups of lentils Abhi will have after adding 3 more cups of lentils, we need to subtract 11 from 14, which gives us 3. So, Abhi will have 3 additional cups of lentils after adding 3 more cups.
Response:  If they had 3 cups of rice and wanted to make 10 cups of chowmein, then they would need an additional 7 cups of water (since 1 cup of water is required for every cup of rice). So, in total, they needed 10 + 7 = 17 cups of water. Now, if they had already used up 5 cups of water, that means they have 17 - 5 = 12 cups of water left. Therefore, they can make 12 cups of chowmein.
Response:  The total amount of chini and dal is 5 + 13 = 18. If they want to have half of it (as per their request), then they will get 18 / 2 = 9. So, they will get 9 cups of chini and 9 cups of dal.
"Response:  We have been given that Meri has 6 cups of rice and 14 cups of lentils. She wants to make 7 cups of chapattis. So, we need to find out how many cups of atta (flour) she will require. Now, let's calculate it:

Required atta = Total amount of rice x Conversion ratio of rice to atta
= 6 cups x 250 g/cup
= 1500 g

Now, let's convert it to cups:

Required atta in cups = 1500 g / 100 g/cup
= 15 cups

So, Meri needs 15 cups of atta to make 7 cups of chapattis."
"Response:  We have been given two quantities - 11 cups of rice and 9 cups of lentils.  To find out how many cups of chickpeas are required, we need to divide the quantity of chickpeas by the total quantity of rice and lentils. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of cups of chickpeas = (Quantity of chickpeas / Total quantity of rice + lentils) x 100
= (12 / 11 + 9) x 100
= 137.64%
Therefore, approximately 137.64% of the total quantity is chickpeas."
"Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun dairy  = 3 cups milk + 10 cups water = 13 cups total liquid (Note: I have assumed that ""kek"" means cup in Nepali)  Now, let's calculate how much dal and rice are required based on the number of people eating:  Dal: For 6 people, we need 6/15 = 1/2 cup of dal per person = 3 cups total dal Rice: For 6 people, we need 6/15 = 1/3 cup of rice per person = 4.5 cups total rice So, to make 15 cups of food, we will need 3 cups of dal and 4.5 cups of rice."
Response:  Meri has 9 cups of rice and wants to make 14 cups of chini (a type of soup). She also has 40 cups of water. To make chini, she needs 3 cups of dal (lentils) which she doesn't have. So, she needs 3 + 9 = 12 cups of water more to make enough chini for 14 cups. Therefore, the answer is 12 cups.
Response:  Meri le ke kek pakaun daile 9 cups of rice are required, and Nuksa has provided 7 cups of atta (flour) and 4 cups of nuun (lentils). So, there is a shortage of 2 cups of atta. Now, let's calculate how many cups of atta are needed to make up for the shortage. Since each cup of atta makes 2 cups of bhindi, we need 2 x 2 = 4 cups of atta to cover the shortage. Therefore, the final amount of atta that Unnle needs to provide is 7 - 4 = 3 cups of atta.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice are required for 11 people and how much water is needed for that amount of rice.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of cups of rice required for each person.  Since there are 12 cups of rice in total, and 11 people are eating, so each person will get 1 cup of rice. Therefore, the number of cups of rice required for 11 people is 11. Now, let's move on to calculating the water requirement. As per the recipe, 1 cup of rice requires 3 cups of water. So, if 11 people are eating 1 cup of rice each, then the total quantity of water required is 3 x 11 = 33 cups.
Response:  We have been given that Meri has 7 cups of rice and wants to distribute it equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 7/10 = 35% of the total rice. Now, we know that there are 4 cups of chicken in the pot, which means that each person will get 35% of 4 = 1.4 cups of chicken. Since there are 10 people, the total amount of chicken required is 1.4 x 10 = 14 cups. Therefore, the answer is 14 cups.
Response:  We have to make 12 cups of tea using 14 cups of water and 10 cups of rice. So, we need 2 cups of water left over after making all the tea. Therefore, the answer is 2 cups.
"Response:  If there are 19 families living in the area with an average of 6 members per family, then the total number of people living in that area is:

19 families x 6 members/family = 114 people

Now, if 30% of these people have cars, then the number of cars in that area is:

114 people x 30% = 34 cars

So, out of 19 families, approximately 8 families (i.e., 40%) own at least one car."
"Response:  If there are 87 families living in that area and each family has an average of 5 members, then the total population of that area is:

87 families x 5 members per family = 435 people

Now, if 20% of those people have to leave their homes due to flooding, we can calculate it as follows:

435 people x 20% = 87 people (approximately)

So, approximately 87 people will have to leave their homes due to flooding in that area."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are around 20 families living in those houses.  Out of them, 8 families have dogs and 6 families do not have dogs.  So, the number of dog owners is 8/20 = 0.4 or approximately 40% of the total families.  Now, let's calculate the number of dogs owned by each family. If 8 families have dogs, then the total number of dogs is 8 x 14 = 112 dogs.  Therefore, there are approximately 112 dogs in those houses.
"Response:  If there are 85 families living in the mountains and each family has an average of 4 members, then the total number of people living in the mountains is:

85 families x 4 members per family = 340 individuals

Now, let's assume that 23 families from Africa have migrated to the mountains and each family has an average of 7 members. Therefore, the total number of people who have migrated from Africa to the mountains is:

23 families x 7 members per family = 161 individuals

Finally, if 37 families from Asia have also migrated to the mountains and each family has an average of 5 members, then the total number of people who have migrated from Asia to the mountains is:

37 families x 5 members per family = 185 individuals

Therefore, the total number of people living in the mountains after migration is:

340 + 161 + 185 = 686 individuals"
"Response:  We have 82 families living in the mountains who are facing difficulties due to lack of access to basic necessities like food and shelter. Out of these, 42 families are from Africa and 31 families are from Asia. If we provide assistance to each family equally, then the number of families that will benefit from our aid is:

Number of African families = 42
Number of Asian families = 31
Total number of beneficiary families = Number of African families + Number of Asian families
= 42 + 31
= 73 families
Therefore, out of the total 82 families, 73 families (or 90%) will benefit from our aid."
"Response:  If there are 38 families in the village who have to migrate due to landslides and among them, 27 families have already left for their new homes outside the country, then the remaining 11 families will also leave soon.  Now, if we assume that each family has an average of 4-5 members, then the total number of people who have to move from this village is:

Total number of people = Number of families x Average number of members per family
= 11 families x 4-5 members/family
= 44-55 people

So, out of the total 94 people living in the village, 44-55 people (or around 47%) will have to move to their new homes outside the country."
"Response:  If there are 18 families in the village who have to move out due to landslides and if each family has an average of 5 members, then the total number of people who will be affected is:

18 families x 5 members per family = 90 people

Now, let's consider the second part of the question. If 38 families from Africa and 80 families from Asia have to move out, then the total number of people who will be affected is:

38 families x 7 members per family (assuming an average of 7 members per family) = 266 people

80 families x 5 members per family = 400 people

Therefore, the total number of people who will be affected is:

266 + 400 = 666 people"
"Response:  We have 87 families living in the mountains who are facing difficulties due to the cold weather. If we provide each family with 18 new pairs of warm shoes, then the total number of warm shoes provided will be:

87 families x 18 pairs per family = 1562 pairs of warm shoes

Therefore, the answer is 1562."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 families living in the mountains who have to walk for 4-5 km every day to get water from the nearest source.  Out of these 49 families, 24 families have already shifted their residence to lower altitudes due to the increasing difficulty in getting water.  Therefore, the remaining 25 families (49 - 24 = 25) still live in the mountains and have to walk daily to get water.
"Response:  If there are 27 families living in the mountains and each family has an average of 4 members, then the total number of people living in the mountains is:

27 families x 4 members per family = 108 people

Now, let's assume that half of these people (54 individuals) have migrated to the plains due to the cold weather. So, the remaining population in the mountains would be:

108 people - 54 people = 54 people

Therefore, if 41 families had lived in the mountains before the migration, then the updated number of families after the migration would be:

41 families x 4 members per family = 164 people

So, the ratio of families to people in the mountains after the migration is:

164 people / 41 families = 4 families per 10 people

Answer: 4 families per 10 people"
"Response:  If there are 86 families living in the mountains and each family has an average of 5 members, then the total number of people living in the mountains is:

86 families x 5 members per family = 430 individuals

Now, let's assume that half of these individuals (i.e., 215 people) migrated to the plains due to the cold weather. So, the remaining population in the mountains would be:

430 - 215 = 215 individuals

Therefore, if 45 families lived in the mountains before the migration, then after the migration, only 45 / 215 = 0.207 families or approximately 1/5 of the original number of families live in the mountains."
Response:  If there are 41 families in the village who have to migrate due to landslides and among them, 35 families have already left for their new homes in Assam, then we need to find out how many more families will be left behind in Nepal.  So, the number of families remaining in Nepal is:  Number of families remaining in Nepal = Total number of families - Number of families that have already moved to Assam = 41 - 35 = 6 families.  Now, if 62% of the total number of families in the village are from Africa, then the number of African families remaining in Nepal is:  Number of African families remaining in Nepal = Percentage of African families x Total number of families = 62% x 41 = 25.7 families (round off to 26 families).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are around 300 species of birds in Nepal and they migrate to different parts of the world during winter.  Out of these, about 26 new bird species have been recorded in the southern part of Nepal. So, if we assume that each of these new species has around 5-10 individuals, then the total number of birds that migrated from northern parts of Nepal to southern parts would be approximately 130-260 individuals (i.e., 26 x 5 = 130 or 26 x 10 = 260). However, this is just an estimate as we don't have exact data on the number of individuals for each species.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pallavi's birthday is on February 25th. So, she will be celebrating her 253rd birthday this year. Now, let's calculate how many books she has read or written during her school days. According to the question, she studied in a school for 70 years and wrote/read 700 books during that time. Therefore, the total number of books Pallavi has read or written is 700 x 70 = 49,000 books.
Response:  We know that the person was born in 1950 and their school year ended when they were 23 years old (which is 1973). So, if we calculate from their birthday to the end of their school year, it will be around 23 years. Now, let's assume that they didn't work for any company during those 23 years, so their total working experience would be zero. Therefore, the number of pens they have used in their lifetime can be calculated as follows: Total working experience = Zero Pens used = 0
Response:  We know that in our birthday (440 days), we had 111 pens with us. Out of those, 106 pens were used and 5 remained. So, the number of pens used is 106.
Response:  We know that Pallavi's birthday is on June 20th and she has 65 friends in her class. In one year, they gave her 213 pens as gifts. So, we can calculate how many pens each friend gave to Pallavi. It means that each friend gave 16 pens (213/13 = 16) to Pallavi.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pallavi's birthday is on March 20th and she received 589 rupees as gift from her friends. Then, in the next year, she gave away 161 rupees to her friends as gifts. So, the total amount of money Pallavi spent on gifts for her friends in one year was 161 + 589 = 750 rupees. Therefore, the difference between the amount Pallavi spent on gifts for her friends and the amount she received as gift from them is 750 - 589 = 161 rupees.
Response:  We know that in one year, Aafno's age increases by 11 months. So, at the beginning of the second year, his age will be 120 months old. Now, let's calculate how many pens he got as gifts during the second year. According to the question, Aafno received 90 pens from his friends during the second year. Since each pen weighs 41 grams, the total weight of all the pens he received is 3690 grams (90 x 41 grams). Therefore, the difference between the total weight of pens he received and the weight of the pens he gave away is 412 grams (3690 - 3278 grams).
Response:  We know that in one year, the student received 563 pens as gifts from his friends on his birthday. If he gave away 332 pens to his friends, then he must have received (563 - 332) = 231 pens as gifts on his birthday.
Response:  We know that in one year, the student received 52 pens as gifts from his friends. If he gave away 492 pens, then he must have received an equal number of pens (i.e., 492 pens) as gifts during that year. So, the total number of pens the student received and gave away is 52 + 492 = 544 pens.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Pallavi's birthday is on May 21st and she has 521 friends in her school. Since each friend gives Rs. 66 as gift, the total amount of money received from all friends is:

521 friends x Rs. 66 per friend = Rs. 34,766

Now, let's calculate how much money Pallavi spent on gifts for each of her 154 classmates. Since she gave Rs. 154 to each of them, the total amount she spent on gifts is:

154 classmates x Rs. 154 per classmate = Rs. 23,600

So, the difference between the total amount of money Pallavi received (Rs. 34,766) and the total amount she spent on gifts (Rs. 23,600) is:

Rs. 34,766 - Rs. 23,600 = Rs. 11,166

Therefore, Pallavi had Rs. 11,166 left after buying gifts for all her classmates."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Pallavi scored 531 marks in her Class X examination and received a reward of Rs. 391 from her school. Now, let's calculate how much she earned per mark. To do this, we need to divide the reward amount (Rs. 391) by the total number of marks obtained (531). So, the earning per mark is:

Rs. 391 / 531 = Rs. 0.74 per mark
Now, let's find out how many pensils (a unit of measurement used for weight) Pallavi can buy with one rupee. We know that one rupee is equal to 100 paise, and one penis is equal to 25 paise. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of one penis as follows:

Rs. 1 / 100 = Rs. 0.01 per paise
Pennis = Rs. 0.01 x 25 = Rs. 0.25 per penis
So, Pallavi can buy approximately 38.4 pensils (Rs. 0.25 x 38.4 = Rs. 10.65) with one rupee."
Response:  We know that Pallavi's birthday is on June 10th and she has 610 friends in her school. Each friend gave her 406 erasers as gifts, so altogether she received 25780 erasers (610 x 406). However, we are also given that Pallavi herself gave away 336 erasers to her classmates during the school year, leaving her with 22424 erasers (25780 - 336). Therefore, the number of erasers that Pallavi had after the school year was 22424.
"Response:  We know that Pallavi was born in 1995 and her school year started from March 2014. So, she completed her schooling for 12 years (from March 2014 to March 2026). Now, let's calculate how many pens she got as a gift on her birthday during these 12 years:

Year    | Number of Pens Received
--------|-----------------------
2014   | 0
2015   | 1
2016   | 2
...     |...
2026   | 315

Therefore, Pallavi received a total of 315 pens as gifts on her birthday during these 12 years."
Response:  We know that Pallavi's birthday is on February 26th and she has 308 friends in her school.  In total, they gave her 231 pens as gifts. So, each friend gave her approximately 14 pens (231/308).
Response:  We know that Pallavi has scored 457 in her entrance exam and got 320 marks in her school leaving certificate. If she had scored 523 marks in her entrance exam without any deduction, then how many marks did she score in her actual exam?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of marks she actually scored from the total marks she could have scored if there was no deduction. So, the difference between the two scores is equal to the actual marks she scored. Therefore, the answer is (457 - 320) = 137 marks.
Response:  We have 11 water bottles and each bottle contains 30 grams of water. So, in total, we have 11 x 30 = 330 grams of water. Now, out of these 330 grams, 2 grams are spilled. So, the remaining amount of water is 330 - 2 = 328 grams.
Response:  We have 3 water bottles initially containing 4 cups of water each. So, in total, we have 12 cups of water. Now, let's say some people took some water from these bottles and gave it to others. After this process, there are 4 fewer bottles than before, but the number of cups remains the same (i.e., 12). Therefore, the number of cups per bottle decreases by 4/3 = 1 cup per bottle.
Response:  We know that 9 people went to the weather forecaster and 12 people came back. So, if we divide the number of people who came back (12) by the number of people who went (9), we get the ratio of people who returned : People who didn't return = 12/9 = 3/4. Therefore, approximately 3/4 of the people who went to the weather forecaster returned.
Response:  We have 14 water bottles and 5 customers. Each customer can take one bottle at a time. So, in total, we need to divide 14 bottles among 5 customers. To do this, we will give each customer 2-3 bottles (since there are 5 customers). Therefore, the number of bottles each customer gets is 2 or 3.
Response:  We have 13 customers initially and they buy 4 new products each. So, now we have 13 + 4 = 17 customers. If 9 of them return to buy more products, then the total number of customers becomes 17 - 9 = 8 customers. Therefore, there are 8 customers left after 9 customers return to buy more products.
Response:  Initially, there were 12 customers in the weather forecast office. When 15 new customers arrived, they took away 14 existing customers. So, the number of remaining customers is 12 - 14 = -2. Therefore, there are -2 customers left in the weather forecast office.
Response:  We have 3 water bottles initially containing 8 liters of water each. Now, we add 2 more water bottles, making it 5 water bottles in total. Each water bottle can hold 8 liters of water, so the total capacity of all water bottles is: 3 x 8 = 24 liters + 2 x 8 = 16 liters = 40 liters. Therefore, there are 40 liters of water in total.
Response:  We have 8 water bottles initially containing 5 grams of water each. So, in total, we have 8 x 5 = 40 grams of water. Now, 3 water bottles are taken away, leaving us with 8 - 3 = 5 water bottles. Each of these remaining water bottles contains 5 grams of water, so the total amount of water left is 5 x 5 = 25 grams. Therefore, the difference between the original and final amounts of water is 40 - 25 = 15 grams.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers in the weather forecast office. Then, some of them left and only 14 remained. Now, we need to find out how many new customers came after that. So, the total number of customers now is: 12 + (14 - 12) = 10 new customers.
Response:  We have $3 in our bank account and we want to buy something that costs $2. So, how much money will be left after buying it?  Therefore, there will be $1 left ($3 - $2).
Response:  We have been given that Danas has $40 and he spends $3 on a chocolate bar. So, his remaining amount of money is $40 - $3 = $37.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Danish got for selling his 99 chocolates at $3 each. So, we need to multiply the number of chocolates he sold with their price per piece: 99 x $3 = $327. Now, we subtract the amount that Banki gave him: $327 - $4 = $323. Therefore, Danish received $323 in total from selling his chocolates.
Response:  We have to find out how much each chocolate bar costs in dollars and then calculate the total cost of all three chocolate bars.  So, if one chocolate bar costs $2, then the total cost of three chocolate bars will be $6 (3 x $2).  Now, we need to convert this amount from dollars to rupees.  There are 100 rupees in one dollar, so $6 = Rs. 600 ($6 / 100).  Therefore, the total cost of all three chocolate bars is Rs. 1800 (Rs. 600 x 3).
Response:  We know that Danas has Rs.20 and he spent Rs.6 on chocolates. So, his remaining amount is Rs.20 - Rs.6 = Rs.14. Now, we are asked how many chocolates Danas can buy with Rs.14. To find this out, we need to divide the remaining amount (Rs.14) by the cost of one chocolate (Rs.3). Therefore, Danas can buy 14 / 3 = 4 chocolates.
Response:  We have $7 in total and we spent $2 on chocolates and $3 on candies. So, how much money do we have left? $$ Total amount = $7 \Rightarrow Spent on chocolates = $2 \Rightarrow Remaining amount = Total amount - Spent on chocolates = $7 - $2 = $5 $$ Now, let's calculate the number of dollars left. $$ Number of dollars left = Remaining amount / Dollar value = $5 / $1 = 5 $$ Therefore, there are 5 dollars left.
"Response:  We have been given that Danas has $4 and he spends $7 on candy and $6 on toys. So, his remaining amount of money is:

$4 - $7 = $3
$3 - $6 = $1

Therefore, Danas has $1 left after buying both candy and toys."
Response:  We have two dollars and six dollars. If we spend $6 on chocolates, then we will be left with $2 + $6 = $8. So, we can buy $3 worth of chocolates. Therefore, the amount spent on chocolates is $3.
Response:  We have been given that Danas has $5 and he spends $2 on candy and $3 on toys. So, his remaining amount of money is $5 - $2 = $3.
Response:  The amount of money that Dan and his friends had was $40. They spent $8 on candy. So, they had $32 left. Then, they gave $5 to their friend. Therefore, the total amount of money that Dan and his friends had after giving $5 to their friend is $32 + $5 = $37.
"Response:  We have to find out how much money Danish has in his wallet after buying a chocolate bar worth $3. If he spent $4 more than what he had in his wallet, then we can calculate the amount of money he had initially in his wallet as follows:

Amount of money Danish had in his wallet = Initial amount + Amount spent ( $4 )
= $3 + $4
= $7

So, Danish had $7 in his wallet before buying the chocolate bar."
Response:  We have to find out how much money Danish has in total and then calculate what percentage of that amount he spent on chocolates. So, let's first calculate the total amount of money Danish has: 4 dollars x 3 dollars = 12 dollars Now, we know that Danish spent 10 wraps of chocolate for which he paid 1 dollar each. So, the total amount he spent on chocolates is: 10 wraps x 1 dollar = 10 dollars Therefore, the percentage of money spent on chocolates is: (10 dollars / 12 dollars) x 100% = 83.33% So, Danish spent 83.33% of his total money on chocolates.
Response:  We have been given that there are 3 dollars and 4 dollars in total. So, the total amount of money is $3 + $4 = $7. Now, we need to find out how many chocolates Ramesh got for $7. Since each chocolate costs $2, Ramesh got 7/2 = 3.5 chocolates. Therefore, the answer is 3.5 chocolates.
Response:  We have $5 in total and we spent $3 on chocolates. So, we have $2 left. Now, we spent another $7 on chocolates, so now we have $2 - $7 = $-5 left. Therefore, the amount of money that was spent on chocolates is $7.
Response:  We have been given that Danas has $40 and he spends $7 on candy and $2 on a toy. So, his remaining amount of money is : $40 - $7 = $33. Now, we are asked how much money Kinnu got from Danas. Since Kinnu got $33 from Danas, the answer is (D) $33.
"Response:  We know that Paawalka wrote 115 books and sold them for Rs.78 each. So, he earned total revenue of:

Revenue = Number of books x Price per book
= 115 x 78
= Rs.8670

Now, we are asked how many times the books were sold. To find this out, we need to divide the total revenue by the price per book:

Number of books sold = Revenue / Price per book
= 8670 / 78
= 110

So, Paawalka sold 110 copies of his books."
Response:  We know that Paawal Singh had Rs.137 in his wallet and he spent Rs.105 on books. So, he had Rs.32 left over (Rs.137 - Rs.105 = Rs.32). Therefore, the remaining amount of money in Paawal Singh's wallet was Rs.32.
Response:  We know that Paawalka wrote 108 books and sold them through his own bookstore. Out of these, he gave away 62 books to his friends. So, the number of books left with him after giving away is 108 - 62 = 46 books. Now, we are asked how many books Paawalka would have sold if each book cost Rs. 350. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of books left with Paawalka (46) by the price of each book (Rs. 350). Therefore, the number of books sold by Paawalka is 46 / 350 = 0.13 books per day.
Response:  We know that Polka has 50 books and he sold 151 books through his online store. So, we can calculate the number of books Polka had after selling them as follows: Number of books Polka had = Total number of books sold - Number of books already in stock Total number of books sold = 151 books Sold = 50 books x 2 (since he sold twice) = 100 books Now, let's check if Polka had any books left after selling 100 books: Number of books Polka had after selling = Total number of books available for sale - Number of books sold Total number of books available for sale = 50 books + 100 books = 150 books Therefore, Polka had 150 books left after selling 151 books through his online store.
Response:  We know that Pawalka wrote two books and sold them for Rs.150 each. So, he earned a total of Rs.300 from selling those two books. Now, if he had 58 books to sell, he would have earned Rs.58 x 2 = Rs.116 from selling those additional books. Therefore, the total amount of money Pawalka earned from selling all his books is Rs.300 + Rs.116 = Rs.416.
Response:  We know that Paawalka had 21 books to sell and he sold 42 new books. So, his total number of books for sale is : 21 + 42 = 63 books. Now, if he sold 15 old books, then his remaining books for sale are : 63 - 15 = 48 books. Therefore, the difference in the number of books sold between the old and new books is : 48 - 21 = 27 books.
Response:  We know that Paawalka has 71 books to sell and he wants to sell them at a discount of 38%. So, he will get Rs. 240 as his total revenue from selling all these books. Now, if he wants to sell 116 books, then he will have to reduce the price of each book by 38% to make it attractive for buyers. Therefore, the new price of each book will be: New Price = Old Price x (1 - Discount Percentage) New Price = Rs. 380 x (1 - 0.38) New Price = Rs. 252 per book So, if he sells 116 books, he will earn Rs. 252 x 116 = Rs. 29,344 in revenue.
Response:  We know that Paavalko has 108 books and 55 pens. He wants to sell some of them. If he sells each book for Rs. 66 and each pen for Rs. 23, how much money will he get in total?  First, let's calculate the total value of his books: 108 books x Rs. 66 per book = Rs. 7,048  Next, let's calculate the total value of his pens: 55 pens x Rs. 23 per pen = Rs. 1,225  Now, let's add up the total value of both: Rs. 7,048 + Rs. 1,225 = Rs. 8,273  So, if Paavalko sells all his books and pens, he will get Rs. 8,273 in total.
"Response:  We have:

* 51 books and 106 pens = 828 (written as a decimal)
* 828 / 8 = 103 (rounded to nearest whole number)

So, they sold 103 books and 14 pens."
Response:  If there are 27 books in total and Pollal has given away 136 books, then he must have sold 109 books (27 - 136 = 109).
Response:  We know that Paawalka wrote 134 books and gave away 39 of them to his friends. So, he had 95 books left with him. Now, we are asked how many books he sold through bank transactions. Based on the information given in the question, Paawalka sold 68 books through bank transactions.
"Response:  We know that 95 books and 153 notes are worth Rs. 1300. Now, we have to find out how many books and notes can be bought with Rs. 2300. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of money (Rs. 2300) by the cost per book or note. For books, the cost is Rs. 130 each, so:

Number of books = Total amount / Cost per book = 2300 / 130 = 176 books

For notes, the cost is Rs. 15 each, so:

Number of notes = Total amount / Cost per note = 2300 / 15 = 150 notes

Therefore, with Rs. 2300, you can buy 176 books and 150 notes."
Response:  We know that there are 42 books and 143 pens in total.  Out of these, 113 books and 19 pens were sold. So, the remaining amount of books is 42 - 113 = 71 books. Similarly, the remaining amount of pens is 143 - 19 = 124 pens. Therefore, the number of pens that were not sold is 124 pens.
Response:  Firstly, Jesica cut 8 flowers from her garden and gave 2 to each of her friends. So, she has 10 flowers left in her garden. Now, out of these 10 flowers, how many are gulabs?
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 16 flowers in Jesika's flower basket. Then, she picked 23 flowers from the basket and put them back with 8 more flowers that she had brought from outside. So, now there are 31 flowers in the basket. To find out how many of these flowers are roses, we need to subtract the number of roses (8) from the total number of flowers (31). Therefore, there are 23 non-rose flowers in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, Jesika picked 4 flowers from the garden and made garlands of them. Then she gave 23 flowers to her friend. So, now there are 23 flowers left in the garden. To calculate how many garlands Jesika can make with these remaining flowers, we need to divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers used to make each garland (which is 4). Therefore, Jesika can make 23 / 4 = 5.75 garlands with the remaining flowers.
Response:  Firstly, there were 15 gulabs and Jesika took 33 of them. So, the remaining gulabs are 12 (15 - 33). Now, out of these 12 gulabs, Jesika gave 7 to her friend. So, the number of gulabs left with Jesika is 5 (12 - 7). Therefore, the final number of gulabs that Jesika has is 5.
Response:  Firstly, there were 21 flowers in the vase before Jesica took out 34 flowers and gave them to her friend. So, now there are 21 - 34 = -13 flowers left in the vase. Then, after Jesica's friend took out 15 flowers from the vase, there were -13 + 15 = 2 flowers left in the vase. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 20 vats of flowers were taken out from the garden and now there are only 59 flowers left in the garden. So, the number of flowers that were taken out is equal to the number of flowers remaining in the garden minus the original number of flowers in the garden. Therefore, the number of flowers taken out = 59 - 36 = 23 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, there were 13 flowers in the vase initially. Then, Jesica picked 5 flowers from the vase and gave them to her friend. So, the remaining flowers in the vase were 13 - 5 = 8. Next, Jesica's friend took 21 flowers from the vase, leaving behind 8 flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers left in the vase now is 8 + 21 = 29 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 15 gulabs and 62 vatas of arcids. Now, after Jesica's flower gardening, there are only 17 gulabs and 96 vatas of arcids left. To find out how many gulabs Jesica has cut, we need to subtract the number of gulabs she had from the initial total number of gulabs. Therefore, the answer is: 15 - 17 = -2
Response:  We have 12 gulabs and 2 arkids initially.  Out of them, we cut 10 gulabs and 21 arkids. Now, we are left with 10 gulabs and 21 arkids. To find out how many gulabs and arkids were cut, we need to subtract the number of gulabs and arkids that were not cut from the initial total. So, the answer is: Number of gulabs cut = 10 - 12 = -2 Number of arkids cut = 21 - 2 = 19
Response:  At first, there were 5 gulabs and 3 arkids. Then, Jesica cut some of them from her own flowerbed to give away as gifts. After that, she had 12 gulabs and 2 arkids left in her garden. Now, how many more gulabs than arkids does Jesica have in her garden?
Response:  Firstly, there were 7 flowers of Gulab and 12 flowers of Arki in Jesika's flower bed. Then, Jesika plucked some flowers from her own garden to give as gifts. As a result, there are now 11 flowers of Gulab and 20 flowers of Arki left in the bed. So, the number of Gulab flowers that increased is 4 (11 - 7 = 4) and the number of Arki flowers that decreased is 8 (20 - 12 = 8).
Response:  Jessica has 19 flowers in her bouquet and she wants to give 3 of them to Emily. So, if she gives 3 flowers to Emily, how many flowers will be left with Jessica?
Response:  Firstly, there were 13 gulabs and 84 arkids in Jesika's flower garden. Then, Jesika cut some of them to make space for more flowers. Now, there are 91 arkids and 14 gulabs left in the garden. To find out how many gulabs Jesika cut, we need to subtract the number of gulabs remaining from the total number of gulabs initially. So, the answer is 14 - 9 = 5 gulabs.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 gulabs and 3 arkids. After Jesika cut some of them, there were 7 gulabs and 13 arkids left. Now, we need to find out how many gulabs and arkids Jesika cut. So, let's divide the total number of gulabs by the number of gulabs left after cutting (7) : 16 / 7 = 2. Therefore, Jesika cut 2 gulabs. Similarly, we can calculate for arkids by dividing the total number of arkids by the number of arkids left after cutting (13) : 3 / 13 = 0.23. Therefore, Jesika cut 0.23 arkids.
Response:  At first, there were 6 gulabs and 20 arkids in Jesika's flower garden. Then, Jessica plucked some flowers from her own garden to give as gifts. After giving away some flowers, she had 21 gulabs and 18 arkids left in her garden. Now, after another round of plucking, she has 23 gulabs and 22 arkids in her garden. So, the number of gulabs that Jessica plucked from her own garden this time is: 23 - 21 = 2. Similarly, the number of arkids that she plucked is: 22 - 18 = 4. Therefore, the answer is 2 gulabs and 4 arkids.
Response:  At first, there were 9 gulabs and 6 arkids. Then, Jesica cut some of them to make flower baskets. After that, she had 13 arkids and 3 gulabs left. Now, how many more gulabs did Jesica have than arkids?
Response:  If Robin has 17 inches of hair and he cuts off 3 inches, then he will have 14 inches of hair left. So, if he had 13 inches of hair before cutting, he will have 10 inches of hair after cutting (13 - 3 = 10).
Response:  If Robin took away 20 inches of Kapil's hair, and now there are only 10 inches left, then how much hair did Robin take away from Kapil?  Therefore, the answer is 10 inches.
Response:  We know that Robin took out 16 inches of rope and left with 11 inches. So, he had 5 inches of rope remaining (11 - 16 = 5). Now, if we add 5 inches to the original length of 24 inches, we get 39 inches (24 + 5 = 39). Therefore, Robin has 39 inches of rope now.
Response:  If Robin had 19 inches of hair and it grew an additional 1 inch, then he would have 20 inches of hair now. So, his new length is 20 inches.
Response:  If Robin took 13 innings to complete his cap, and he had surpassed it by 14 innings, then we can calculate the time taken for him to complete one cap as follows: Time = Total number of innings / Number of caps completed = 13/1 = 13 days. Therefore, Robin takes 13 days to complete one cap.
Response:  We know that Robin has 14 inches in length and he cut off 8 inches from it. So now his length is 6 inches. To find out how many times longer than before, we need to divide the remaining length (6 inches) by the original length (14 inches). Therefore, Robin's tail is 20% longer than before.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 vessels in total and each vessel has 53 bottles. So, the total number of bottles is:

12 vessels x 53 bottles/vessel = 638 bottles

So, there are 638 bottles in total."
Response:  We know that there are 21 bottles in total and 53 of them have been filled with water from the park. So, we can conclude that among the remaining 21 bottles, 53/21 = 2.619 (approximately) must be empty.
Response:  We know that Danielle had 63 bottles of nail polish and she gave away 51 of them. So, she has 12 bottles left. Now, we are asked how many bottles of nail polish Danielle has now. Since she gave away 33 bottles, she has 33 - 12 = 21 bottles of nail polish left.
Response:  We know that Danielle had 36 bottles of water in her backpack and she gave away 35 bottles to someone else. So, now she has 1 bottle left in her backpack.  Now, we are asked how many bottles of water Danielle would have if she gave away all the remaining 22 bottles in her backpack. To find this out, we need to divide the number of bottles she wants to give away (22) by the number of bottles she already gave away (35). This gives us an estimate of 0.64 or approximately 1/1.6 bottles of water per person. Therefore, if Danielle gave away all the remaining 22 bottles in her backpack, she would have approximately 14 bottles of water left (22 x 0.64 = 14.28).
Response:  We know that Danielle has 30 bottles of water and she gave away 63 old bottles. So, the number of bottles Danielle has now is 42. Now, let's calculate how many full bottles Danielle has. If each bottle contains 8 ounces (fl oz), then the total amount of water in all 42 bottles is: 42 x 8 fl oz = 336 fl oz. Therefore, Danielle has 336 - 30 = 306 full bottles of water left.
Response:  We know that Danielle has 22 bottles of water and 8 packets of juice. She gives away 14 bottles of water and 5 packets of juice to her friends. So, she has 8 bottles of water and 3 packets of juice left. Now, we are asked how many bottles of water Danielle had initially. To find this out, we can use the information given in the question that Danielle had 22 bottles of water initially. Therefore, the answer is (22).
Response:  We know that Denny has 22 bottles of water and 30 bags of chips. He wants to pack them in boxes so that each box contains exactly 17 bottles or bags. How many boxes can he make?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of items (bottles + bags) by the number of items per box. In this case, there are 22 bottles and 30 bags, for a total of 52 items. If we want each box to contain 17 items, then we can make 52 / 17 = 3 boxes. So Denny can make 3 boxes.
Response:  We know that Danielle has 30 bottles of water and 14 packets of juice in her park bag. She gives away 7 bottles of water and 86 packets of juice to someone else. So, how many bottles of water does she have left in her park bag? To find out, we need to subtract the number of bottles she gave away from the total number of bottles she had. Therefore, the answer is: 30 - 7 = 23 bottles of water left in Danielle's park bag.
Response:  We know that Danielle has 11 bottles of water and 28 packets of juice in her backpack. She gives away 6 bottles of water and 5 packets of juice to someone else. So, she now has 5 bottles of water and 23 packets of juice left in her backpack. Now, we are asked how many more packets of juice Danielle can give away if she has 51 bottles of water in total. To find out, we need to subtract the number of packets she already gave away from the total number of packets she has (23). Therefore, Danielle can give away an additional 28 packets of juice (51 - 23 = 28).
Response:  We know that Danielle has 71 bottles of water and 24 packages of juice. She gives away 30 bottles of water and 8 packages of juice to her friends. So, she has left with 41 bottles of water and 16 packages of juice. Now, we need to find out how many bottles of water Danielle gave away in total. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total number of bottles given away = Number of bottles given away x (Number of people who received them / Number of people who were initially given water) In this case, the number of people who received water is 30, and the number of people who were initially given water is 71. Therefore, the total number of bottles of water given away by Danielle is: Total number of bottles given away = 30 x (30/71) = 21 bottles.
Response:  We know that Danielle has 10 bottles of water and 62 plastic bags. She gives away 27 bottles of water and 43 plastic bags. So, she now has 7 bottles of water left.
Response:  We know that there are 66 bottles in total and Daniel took out 25 of them for his collection. So, the number of bottles left with Danny is 66 - 25 = 41.
Response:  If there are 32 bottles in the park and each bottle has 4 caps, then there will be 128 caps in total (32 x 4 = 128). Now, if there were originally 25 bottles with caps in the park, then after 32 bottles have been added, there will be a total of 63 caps left over (25 - 128 = -63). So, Parka has 63 caps left over.
Response:  We know that Danielle had 60 bottles of wine in her cellar and she drank 58 of them. So, there were 2 bottles left in the cellar. Now, we are asked how many bottles of new wine Danielle added to the cellar. According to the passage, she added 58 new bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles in Danielle's cellar after adding the new ones is: 60 + 58 = 118 bottles.
Response:  We know that Danielle had 60 bottles of water in her park and she gave away 50 bottles to people who were thirsty. So, now she has 10 bottles left in the park. Then, we are told that she went to another place and gave away 30 more bottles of water. Now, let's calculate how many bottles of water Danielle has left after giving away those 30 bottles.  After giving away 30 bottles, Danielle has given a total of 80 bottles (60 + 30) away. So, she has 40 bottles left in her park (10 - 80). Therefore, the number of bottles of water Danielle has left after giving away 30 bottles is 40.
Response:  We know that Danielle had 54 bottles of old wine and she filled 48 new bottles with it. So, the total number of bottles she has now is 52 (old + new). Now, we need to find out how many full bottles Danielle has among these 52 bottles. Since each bottle contains 3/4 of a liter, we can calculate the total amount of liquid in all the full bottles as follows: Full bottles = Total volume of liquids / Volume of one bottle = 52 bottles x 0.75 liters per bottle = 36 liters Therefore, Danielle has 36 liters of full bottles among her 52 bottles.
Response:  We know that Danielle has 82 bottles and 29 packets of snacks. She gives away 42 bottles and takes 61 packets. So, she now has 42 - 42 = 0 bottles and 61 + 29 = 90 packets left. Therefore, Danielle has 0 bottles and 90 packets of snacks.
"Response:  We know that Denny has 66 bottles of water and 39 plastic bags in his parked car. He wants to distribute them equally among 16 people. So, we need to divide these items into groups of 16 each. Now, let's calculate how many bottles or plastic bags each person will get:

For bottled water: 66 / 16 = 4 bottles per person
For plastic bags: 39 / 16 = 2.5 plastic bags per person (since you can't have fractional bags)
So, Denny will give 4 bottles of water and approximately 2.5 plastic bags to each of the 16 people he is distributing them to."
Response:  We know that Danielle has 46 bottles of water and 50 packets of juice in her park. She wants to distribute them equally among 21 people. So, she will give each person 46/21 = 2.19 bottles of water and 50/21 = 2.38 packets of juice. Now, let's calculate how many bottles of water Danielle gave to each person: 2.19 x 21 = 44 bottles of water. Therefore, Danielle distributed 44 bottles of water among 21 people.
Response:  We have 65 bottles and 31 packets in total.  The park has 65 bottles and 9 packets of snacks. So, if we want to distribute them equally among all the people, each person will get: Bottles: 65/7 = 9 bottles per person Packets: 9 packets x 5 = 45 packets per person Now, let's calculate how many packets each person will get based on the number of bottles they got: Person A got 9 bottles, so they will get: 45 packets / 9 bottles = 5 packets per person Person B got 8 bottles, so they will get: 45 packets / 8 bottles = 6 packets per person And so on... Therefore, the answer is: Person A will get 5 packets, Person B will get 6 packets, and so on...
Response:  We know that Danielle has 58 bottles of water and 25 packages of plastic bags. She gives away 11 liters of water and 6 packages of plastic bags to her friend Rachel. So, how many bottles of water does Danielle have left? Well, if she had 58 bottles initially and gave away 11 liters, then she has 58 - 11 = 47 bottles left. And if she had 25 packages of plastic bags initially and gave away 6 packages, then she has 25 - 6 = 19 packages left.
Response:  We have 15 bottles of water and 18 packets of juice. Each packet contains 300 ml of juice, so we have a total of 5400 ml of juice (18 x 300 ml). Now, let's calculate how many bottles of water are needed to fill up all these packets of juice. There are 67 bottles of water in total (67 x 300 ml = 2010 ml), which means that each bottle of water can hold approximately 2010 / 5400 = 0.379 or nearly 38% of the total amount of juice. Therefore, we need approximately 38% of the total number of bottles of water to fill up all the packets of juice. So, the answer is 38%.

Response:  The station has 7 less than 14 more than 15. So, if we subtract 7 from 14, we get 7. Then, if we add 7 to 15, we get 22. Therefore, the correct answer is 22.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the station has 18 less passengers than before and now there are 13 more passengers in the jail. So, the total number of passengers at the station is 19 (18 + 13 = 19). Now, let's find out how many more or fewer passengers there are in the jail compared to the previous year. If there were 13 more passengers in the jail this year, then last year there would have been 13 - 1 = 12 fewer passengers in the jail. Therefore, the total number of passengers in both the station and the jail together is 19 + 12 = 31.
Response:  The station has 3 less than 80 passengers, and the village has 5 more than 24 passengers. So, the total number of passengers in the village is 80 + 5 = 85 passengers. Therefore, the difference between the number of passengers in the station and the village is 85 - 3 = 82 passengers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money in the station is Rs.1200 and it has decreased to Rs.980 after some time. Now, we are told that the amount of money in the station increased by Rs.40. So, the new amount of money in the station would be: Rs.980 + Rs.40 = Rs.1020. Therefore, the amount of money in the station after the increase is Rs.1020.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the station has 7 compartments and each compartment can accommodate 16 passengers. So, in total, there are 7 x 16 = 112 passengers who can travel in one train. Now, let's consider how many trains are available for travel. We know that there are 9 more trains than the previous year, so the number of trains this year is 9 + 1 = 10. Therefore, the total number of passengers who can travel per day is 112 x 10 = 1120 passengers.
Response:  The station is 7 km away from the village and the junction is 8 km away from the village. So, the distance between the station and the junction is: Station to Junction = 7 km + 8 km = 15 km Now, we need to find out how much time it takes for the train to reach the junction from the station. We are given that the speed of the train is 17 km/h. Therefore, the time taken for the train to reach the junction from the station can be calculated as: Time = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 17 km/h = 0.87 hours or 52 minutes.
Response:  We know that the station has 16 vats and the revenue of the station is Rs.9000. Now, we need to find out how much revenue each vat generates. To do this, we divide the total revenue by the number of vats: Rs.9000 / 16 = Rs.562.5 per vat. Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by each jar in terms of rupees: Rs.562.5 x 9 jars = Rs.4837.5. So, the revenue generated by each jar is Rs.4837.5.
Response:  If Jaxson has 6 vats of rice and he gives 18 vats to the village, then he will have 6 - 18 = -12 vats left. So, Jaxson has -12 vats of rice. Now, if the village gets 5 more vats from Jaxson, then the total amount of rice in the village is 18 + 5 = 23 vats.
Response:  If Jaxson's station has 5 less water than before and his station is in a different location with 18 more water than before, then we can calculate the new amount of water at Jaxson's station as follows: New water at Jaxson's station = Old water at Jaxson's station - (New water at old location x Transfer ratio) New water at Jaxson's station = 87 - (18 x Transfer ratio) Now, we need to find out what the transfer ratio is. According to the question, if the jil (district) has 87 more water than before and Jaxson's station is located in that district, then the transfer ratio would be equal to the number of additional water in the jil divided by the total water available in the jil. Transfer ratio = Additional water in jil / Total water available in jil = 87 / 265 = 0.324 Therefore, the new amount of water at Jaxson's station would be: New water at Jaxson's station = 87 - (18 x 0.324) = 87 - 5.92 = 81.08 So, there will be 81.08 liters of water left at Jaxson's station after the transfer.
Response:  If the number of students in the school decreases by 16, and the amount of money collected per student is Rs. 15 less, then the total amount of money collected will be:  School students decrease by 16 = (16 x 100)% = 1600 - 16 = 1584  So, if the number of students in the village increases by 12, then the total amount of money collected will be:  Total amount of money collected = Number of students x Amount of money collected per student  Therefore, the total amount of money collected will increase by 12 x Rs. 15 = Rs. 180.
"Response:  We have to find out how many steps are there in total and then calculate the average step length.  So, let's break down the given information into smaller parts:

Total number of steps = 12 + 79 = 91 steps
Average step length = Total distance / Number of steps
= 80 km / 91 steps
= 875 meters per step (approximately)"
Response:  We know that the number of steps taken by Jack is less than 13 and more than 3. So, let's assume that Jack took 9 steps. Now, we are asked how many steps Steve took. Since Steve took 8 steps, we can conclude that Steve took 2 fewer steps than Jack. Therefore, the difference between the number of steps taken by Jack and Steve is 9 - 8 = 1.
"Response:  We know that the number of steps in the staircase is 17 and the height difference between each step is 8 cm. So, the total height difference between the top and bottom of the staircase is:

 Height difference = Number of steps x Step height = 17 x 8 = 136 cm

Now, we are asked how much more or less than 80 cm the actual height difference is. To find this out, we need to subtract or add the given value (80 cm) from the calculated height difference:

Actual height difference = Calculated height difference - Given value = 136 cm - 80 cm = 56 cm

So, the actual height difference between the top and bottom of the staircase is 56 cm."
Response:  We know that the number of steps taken by Jack is 3 less than the number of steps taken by Sarah. So, if Sarah took 12 vats (steps) in one direction and 15 vats in the other direction, then Jack took 9 vats in one direction and 12 vats in the other direction. Therefore, the difference between the number of steps taken by Jack and Sarah is 3 vats.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of votes in the constituency is 1200 and out of which 400 are from the town. So, the number of votes from the town is 400/1200 = 33.33%. Now, let's calculate the difference between the total number of votes in the constituency and the number of votes from the town. Total number of votes in the constituency - Number of votes from the town = 1200 - 33.33% = 866.67%. Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of votes from the town is (866.67% / 400) x 100 = 216.15%.
Response:  We have to find out how much of the total area (18 vats) is covered by the remaining land (12 vats). So, we need to subtract the area of the remaining land from the total area.  Area of the remaining land = Total area - Area of the stevenage (8 vats) = 18 vats - 8 vats = 10 vats Now, we know that 10 vats of land are left after the construction of the stevenage. Therefore, the percentage of the remaining land in relation to the total area is: Percentage of remaining land = (Area of remaining land / Total area) x 100% = (10 vats / 18 vats) x 100% = 56%
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are studying in each school. We know that there are 19 schools and each school has an average of 12 students. So, the total number of students studying in all schools is:

19 x 12 = 228

Now, let's find out how many students are studying in each village. We know that there are 7 villages and each village has an average of 72 students. So, the total number of students studying in all villages is:

7 x 72 = 496

So, the difference between the total number of students studying in all schools and all villages is:

228 - 496 = -268

Therefore, Jack's guess was incorrect as the actual difference between the number of students studying in all schools and all villages is negative."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of villages in the district is 14 and each village has 6-7 houses. So, the total number of houses in all the villages is:

14 x 6 = 84 houses

Now, let's find out how many houses are there in each jil (sub-district). We know that there are 3 jils in the district and each jil has 3-4 villages. So, the total number of houses in all the jils is:

3 x 4 = 12 houses per jil

So, the total number of houses in the entire district is:

84 + 12 x 3 = 252 houses

Therefore, there are 252 houses in the entire district."
Response:  We know that the number of steps taken by Jack is 84 more than the number of steps taken by Sarah. So, if Sarah took 10 steps, then Jack took 94 steps (84 + 10 = 94). Now, we are asked to find out how many steps Jack took in total. From the previous question, we know that Jack took 13 vats of water and Sarah took 52 vats of water. Since each vat contains 4 steps, Jack took 52 x 4 = 208 steps in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 208 steps.
Response:  We know that 13 - 8 = 5 and 17 - 12 = 5. So, there are 5 vats of syau and 5 vats of rice.
"Response:  We have to find out how much more or less the total area of the two plots is.  The first plot has an area of 8 watas and the second plot has an area of 10 watas, so the difference between them is:

Area of first plot - Area of second plot = 8 - 10 = -2 watas

Now we need to convert this negative value into a positive one. Since we are dealing with areas, we can simply multiply the negative value by -1 to get the correct result:

-2 watas x -1 = 2 watas

So, the total area of both plots together is 2 watas more than the area of the second plot alone."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that station A has 3 less passengers than station B and Station B has 4 more passengers than station A. So, if there are 19 passengers at station A and 15 passengers at station B, then the difference in number of passengers between them is:

Station B - Station A = 19 - 15 = 4

Now, we need to find out how much more or less passengers station B has compared to station A. If station B has 4 more passengers than station A, then the difference in number of passengers between them can be calculated as follows:

Station B - Station A = 4

So, station B has 4 more passengers than station A."
Response:  Ollibhiako valtemma $78 and Supermarket price is $15 per dollar. So total amount spent in supermarket = $78 x $15 = $1170. Now, if they made $150 profit, then their total earning from selling goods in supermarket would be $1170 + $150 = $1320.
Response:  Ollibhyalale spent $78 at Supermarket. If they got $33 back as change, how much money did they have before spending?  So, Ollibhyalale had $45 ($78 - $33) before spending.
Response:  Firstly, Oliva bought $100 worth of dollars from ATM and spent $148 on supermarket. So, she had $148 - $100 = $48 left with her. Then, she spent $159 on jewelry. Therefore, her remaining amount after buying jewelry was $48 - $159 = -$111.
Response:  Firstly, Oliva bought $30 worth of goods from ATM Bank and got $49 back as change. So, he gained $19 in total. Now, let's calculate how much money he spent at Super Market after getting the change from ATM Bank. If he spent $49 at Super Market, then he had $19 left with him initially. Therefore, the amount he spent at Super Market is $29 ($49 - $19).
Response:  Firstly, Oliva bought $53 from ATM and gave $91 to Ethan. Then, she got $14 back from Supermarket. So, the total amount of money that Oliva gained was: $53 + ($91 - $14) = $62.
Response:  Ollibhiako Parsamā 106 dollars and they spent 26 dollars in supermarket and 49 dollars in shoes. If they had spent 49 dollars more in shoes, how much would they have spent in total?  Total amount = Supermarket expense + Shoe expense = 26 + 49 = 75 dollars.
Response:  Ollibhyalale spent $29 on supermarket items and received change of $54. So, if they had paid with a $50 bill, how much did they get back in change? $$ \therefore \text {Change = $54 - $50 = $4}$$
Response:  Ollibhyalale spent $38 on supermarket items. If they got a discount of $128, then the actual price they paid would be: $38 - ($128 / 2) = $38 - $64 = $74 So, Ollibhyalale saved $56.
Response:  We know that Debakshi had 19 votes in total and she removed 5 of them. So, now she has 14 votes left. To find out how many votes are required to make her the leader, we need to divide the number of remaining votes (14) by the number of candidates (3). Therefore, the minimum number of votes required for Debakshi to become the leader is: 14 / 3 = 4.67 votes. Since we can't have a fraction of a vote, round up to the nearest whole number which gives us 5 votes. So, Debakshi needs 5 more votes to become the leader.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 months in total and we have to find out how many days are there in each month. So, let's calculate it as follows:

Month 1: 18 days
Month 2: 19 days (as there are 18 days in Month 1 + 1 day)
Month 3: 20 days (as there are 19 days in Month 2 + 1 day)
.........
Month 18: 176 days (as there are 18 months x 18 days/month)
Total number of days = 176 days + 5 days (extra days in last month) = 181 days
So, the correct answer is 181 days."
Response:  Firstly, Debakshi had 10 apps in her phone and she deleted 4 of them. So, she has 6 apps left (10 - 4 = 6). Now, she downloaded 11 new apps, so she has a total of 17 apps (6 + 11 = 17). Therefore, the correct answer is 17.
Response:  Firstly, Debakshi had 21 friends in her phonebook and she added 8 new contacts. So, the total number of contacts in her phonebook now is 21 + 8 = 29.  Then, she deleted 4 contacts from her phonebook, so the remaining number of contacts is 29 - 4 = 25. Therefore, out of the 25 remaining contacts, 8 were added by Debakshi herself, which means that 17 (25 - 8) contacts were already present in her phonebook before she started adding new ones.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many new employees were appointed in Debhakos company after the merger. According to the question, 71 new employees were appointed. Now, we need to calculate the percentage of new employees among all the employees who worked for Debhakos before the merger. The total number of employees working for Debhakos before the merger was 150. So, the percentage of new employees is (71/150) x 100 = 47%. Therefore, out of the 140 employees who left Debhakos after the merger, 47% or 63 employees were new employees who joined the company after the merger.
Response:  We have to find out how many apps and files were there initially. From the question, we know that there were 16 apps and 77 files in total. Now, let's calculate how many apps and files each person had. If there were 5 people, then each person had 16/5 = 3 apps and 23/5 = 4.6 files. Since it is not possible to have a fraction of an app or file, we round off these numbers to the nearest whole number. So, each person had 3 apps and 4 files. Now, let's check who deleted the most number of apps and files. According to the question, some people deleted 3 apps and 20 files, while others deleted 2 apps and 18 files. Therefore, the person who deleted the most number of apps and files was the one who deleted 3 apps and 20 files.
Response:  We know that there are 17 applications and 21 files in total.  Of those, 3 apps and 7 files can be used for both the phone and computer. So, the number of unique apps and files is:  Unique Applications = 17 - 3 = 14 Unique Files = 21 - 7 = 14 Therefore, there are 14 unique applications and 14 unique files that can be used for both the phone and computer.
Response:  We know that there are 15 employees in Debhakosh and they have uploaded 24 files to their phones. Now, we need to calculate how many files each employee has uploaded. To do this, we divide the total number of files (24) by the total number of employees (15). So, each employee has uploaded approximately १६ (16) files.
Response:  We know that there are 19 apps and 18 files in Debbie's phone.  If we divide the number of apps by the number of files, we get 19/18 = 1.0625. So, approximately 6.25 apps can fit in one file.
Response:  We know that Debakshi had 17 applications accepted and 18 bank accounts opened. So, the total number of applications is 17 + 18 = 35.
Response:  We know that there are 59 files and 15 executables in the Debian system.  Out of these, 12 applications and 30 files were removed. So, the number of remaining files is:  Remaining files = Number of files before removal - Number of files removed = 59 - 12 = 47 files.
Response:  We know that there are 24 files and 13 employees in Debak's phone. Each employee has at least 7 files (as mentioned in the problem statement), so we can say that each employee has at most 24 / 13 = 1.85 files per person. Therefore, the total number of files an employee can have is at most 1.85 x 13 = 22.75 files. Now, let's calculate the total number of files available for all employees including Debak. Since Debak has 24 files, he cannot be included in this calculation. So, the total number of files available for all employees except Debak is 24 - 13 = 11 files. Finally, we need to subtract the number of files an employee can have from the total number of files available for all employees to get the number of files left for Debak. Therefore, the number of files left for Debak is 11 - 22.75 = -11.75 files.
Response:  We know that there are 24 files in total and we have to find out how many files can be accommodated in 9 slots of the phone.  Since each slot can hold at most 3 files, we can accommodate 9 x 3 = 27 files in all. But as per the question, only 12 apps were banked, so the remaining 15 files cannot be accommodated. Therefore, the number of files that can be accommodated in the phone is 27 - 15 = 12.
Response:  We know that there are 11 applications and 3 files in Debbie's phone. Each application takes up space according to its size, so we need to calculate how much space each app takes. For example, Instagram takes up 24 MB of space, Facebook takes up 20 MB of space, Twitter takes up 15 MB of space, etc. Therefore, if we add all these sizes together, we get: Application Space = (Instagram Size + Facebook Size + Twitter Size +...). Similarly, for files, we can calculate their total size as follows: File Space = (File Size 1 + File Size 2 + File Size 3 +...) Now let's assume that Debbie has 24 GB of free storage space available on her phone. So, we can divide this amount among the apps and files accordingly: App Space / Free Storage Space = (Application Size / Total Available Space) x 100% Filespace / Free Storage Space = (File Size / Total Available Space) x 100%. Based on the above calculations, we can determine that approximately 76% of Debbie's free storage space is taken up by her apps, while around 24% is used by her files.
Response:  We know that Neel has 24 cards and he gave 136 cards to Jeffrey. So, we need to find out how many cards Neel got back from Jeffrey. To do this, we can divide the number of cards Neel gave to Jeffrey (136) by the total number of cards Neel had (24). This gives us the ratio of cards returned to Neel by Jeffrey, which is 5.79 ( rounded off to two decimal places). Therefore, Neel received 58 cards (rounded off to two decimal places) from Jeffrey.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neel has given 301 cards to Jeff and now he has 154 cards left. So, the number of cards Neel gave to Jeff is 301 - 154 = 147 cards.
Response:  We know that Neel has 528 cards and Jeef has 11 cards. So, Neel gave Jeef some cards. The number of cards Neel gave to Jeef is (528 - 11) = 517 cards.
Response:  We know that Neel has 56 cards and Jeff has 234 cards. Now, we need to find out how many cards Jeff gave to Neel. Since Jeff had more cards than Neel, he could have given him at least some of his extra cards. So, let's assume that Jeff gave Neel 100 cards (which is a reasonable number considering their difference in card counts). Therefore, after receiving the cards from Jeff, Neel now has 56 + 100 = 156 cards.
Response:  We know that Neel had 309 base cards and gave away 156 of them. Now he has 154 base cards left. To find out how many basic cards Neel has now, we need to subtract the number of cards he gave away from the total number of base cards he had. So, 309 - 156 = 153. Therefore, Neel has 153 basic cards left.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many cards Neil has given to Jeffrey in total. From the question, we know that Neil gave 246 basball cards and 140 cards to Jeffrey. So, the total number of cards Neil gave to Jeffrey is:

246 + 140 = 386

Now, we need to find out how many baseball cards are left with Neil after giving them to Jeffrey. According to the question, Neil had 404 baseball cards initially, and he gave 386 cards to Jeffrey. Therefore, the number of baseball cards left with Neil is:

404 - 386 = 18

So, the number of baseball cards that Neil has left is 18."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neel had 573 cards and gave away 195 of them. Now, he has 200 cards left with him. To find out how many cards Jeefala got from Neel, we need to subtract the number of cards Neel gave away (195) from the total number of cards he had (573). So, Jeefala got 378 cards from Neel.
Response:  We know that Neel had 438 cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, we need to find out how many cards Neel has left after giving some to Jeff. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that Neel gave 10 cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards Neel has left is: Number of cards Neel had - Number of cards Neel gave to Jeff = 438 - 10 = 428 cards. Therefore, Neel has 428 cards left.
Response:  We know that initially there were 239 base cards and 38 bonus cards, resulting in a total of 277 cards. Now, we are told that Jeff gave away some cards to his friends, leaving him with 376 basic cards and 111 bonus cards. So, the number of base cards that Jeff had after giving away some cards is: 376 - 239 = 137 base cards. Therefore, the number of base cards that Jeff has now is 137.
Response:  We know that 19 watermelons were eaten and 35 watermelons were banked. So, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after they were eaten and banked. To do this, we can use subtraction.  Subtracting 35 from 19 gives us 16. Therefore, there are 16 watermelons left after they were eaten and banked.
Response:  We know that Pako had 28 cookies and he ate 7 of them. So, the number of cookies left with him is 28 - 7 = 21 cookies.
Response:  We know that Pakistako had 40 watermelons and he gave 2 to his friend. So, now Pakotko has 38 watermelons left. Then, his friend gave him 17 watermelons. Now, Pakotko has 55 watermelons in total. Therefore, the number of watermelons Pakotko had after giving 2 to his friend is 38, and the number of watermelons he got back from his friend is 17, so the final number of watermelons Pakotko has is 55.
Response:  Pako had 25 cookies and ate 5 of them. Now he has 20 cookies left. If he eats another 3 cookies, how many will he have left? So, the number of cookies Pako will have left after eating 3 more is 17 (20 - 3 = 17).
"Response:  Paku had 13 kukri and he ate 2 vats of rice. Now, let's calculate how many kukris he has left.  Number of kukris Paku had initially = 13
Number of vats of rice eaten by Paku = 2
Now, we need to find out how many kukris are left after eating 2 vats of rice. To do this, we will divide the number of initial kukris by the number of vats of rice eaten. So, the number of kukris left after eating 2 vats of rice = 13 / 2 = 6
Therefore, there are 6 kukris left with Paku."
Response:  We know that Pakistokol has eaten 40 watermelons and given away 5 watermelons to his friend. So, he has 35 watermelons left with him.
Response:  We know that Paku had 17 kukis and he gave 14 to his friend. So, now Paku has 3 (17 - 14) kukis left. Then, he gave 13 of those remaining kukis to his friend. Now, Paku has 0 kukis left, as he gave all of them away. Therefore, the number of kukis that Paku had after giving some to his friend is 0.
Response:  We know that Paku had 12 kukis and he gave 16 to his friend. So, initially, Paku had 12 - 16 = -4 kukis. Now, his friend returned 21 kukis to him, so now Paku has 21 + (-4) = 17 kukis. Therefore, the number of kukis Paku gained is 17 - 12 = 5 kukis.
Response:  We know that Pako has 22 watermelons and he gives 15 watermelons to his friend Kaka. So, Pako has 7 watermelons left. Now, we are told that Kaka eats 54 watermelons of Pako's remaining watermelons. Therefore, after Kaka eating the watermelons, Pako is left with 39 watermelons. Thus, the answer is 39.
Response:  We know that Pakiko has 9 watermelons and he gives 36 watermelons to Mithila. So, the number of watermelons left with Pakiko is 36 - 9 = 27 watermelons. Now, we are told that Mithila eats 6 watermelons. So, the number of watermelons left with Mithila after she eats them is 27 - 6 = 21 watermelons. Therefore, the total number of watermelons consumed by both Pakiko and Mithila is 21 + 9 = 30 watermelons.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice are required for each meal and then calculate the total number of cups needed throughout the day.  For breakfast, we need 37 cups of rice (37/4 = 9 cups per meal). Since they had 5 meals in a day, we need 5 x 9 = 45 cups of rice for breakfast. Similarly, for lunch and dinner, we need 11 cups of rice per meal, so we need 5 x 11 = 55 cups of rice for lunch and 5 x 11 = 55 cups of rice for dinner. Therefore, the total number of cups of rice needed throughout the day is 45 + 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 260 cups.
Response:  We know that Pakoko has 8 watermelons and he gives 20 watermelons to Nunu. So, Nunu gets 4 watermelons more than what Pakoko had. Therefore, the number of watermelons Nunu has is : 20 - 8 = 12 watermelons. Now we need to find out how many watermelons Nunu gave to Kaka. According to the question, Nunu gave 6 watermelons to Kaka. So, the total number of watermelons Kaka has is : 12 + 6 = 18 watermelons.
Response:  If Pako has eaten 36 watermelons and Surumaa has eaten 37 watermelons, then how many watermelons Pakoko has left? We know that Pako had 36 watermelons initially, so he must have eaten 36 - 37 = -1 watermelon. Therefore, Pakoko has no watermelons left.
Response:  Pako had 36 cookies and shared them equally among his 4 friends. So each friend got 9 cookies (36/4 = 9). Now, Pako gave 10 of those cookies to one of his friends. Therefore, the number of cookies left with Pako is 9 - 10 = -1 cookies. Hence, Pako has -1 cookie(s) left.
Response:  We know that Paku had 41 cookies and shared them equally among his friends. So each friend got 9 cookies (41/5 = 9). Now, we are asked how much more cookie did Paku eat than what he gave to his friends. To find this, we need to subtract the number of cookies given to friends from the total number of cookies Paku had. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paku ate and those he gave to his friends is: 41 - 9 = 32 cookies.
Response:  Paku consumed 6 kukis and gave his friend 30 vats of kuki juice. Then he himself drank 23 vats of kuki juice. So, the difference in the number of vats of kuki juice that Paku consumed and gave away is: 30 - 23 = 7 vats of kuki juice.
Response:  We know that Pako has 97 vats of rice and he wants to distribute them equally among his 34 friends. So, each friend will get 97/34 = 2.85 vats of rice. Now, let's calculate how many vats of rice Pako will have after distributing 15 mounds of rice among his friends. Since each mound contains 56 vats of rice, Pako will get 15 x 56 = 840 vats of rice. Finally, we subtract the number of vats of rice that Pako gave away (840 - 56 = 784) from the total number of vats of rice he had initially (97), which gives us the remaining amount of rice that Pako has now (97 - 784 = -687). Therefore, Pako does not have any mithai left.
Response:  We know that Pakoko had 26 watermelons and he gave 17 watermelons to his friend Mithila. So, the remaining watermelons with him were 9 watermelons. Now, we need to find out how many watermelons Pakoko had before giving any to Mithila. Therefore, the number of watermelons Pakoko had before giving any to Mithila is 26 - 17 = 9 watermelons.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required for each type of rice and then calculate the total amount of water needed.  For basmati rice, we need 39 vats (vat = cup) of water per 1 kg of rice. So, for 23 kg of rice, we need 871 vats (39 x 23) of water.  Similarly, for non-basmati rice, we need 6 vats of water per 1 kg of rice. So, for 23 kg of rice, we need 132 vats (6 x 23) of water. Therefore, the total amount of water needed is 871 + 132 = 1003 vats.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice and lentils are required for 40 people.  For this, we need to divide the total amount of food (280 vata) into equal parts based on the number of people.  Since there are 40 people in total, we can divide the total food quantity as follows:  Food Quantity per Person = Total Food Quantity / Number of People = 280 vata / 40 people = 7 vata per person Now, let's see how much rice and lentils each person will get: Rice Quantity per Person = Total Rice Quantity / Number of People = 15 vata / 40 people = 0.375 vata per person Lentil Quantity per Person = Total Lentil Quantity / Number of People = 28 vata / 40 people = 0.7 vata per person Therefore, each person will get approximately 0.375 vata of rice and 0.7 vata of lentils.
Response:  Gwen's birthday is on July 7th. She received $7 from her friends as a gift. Then she spent some money on a new dress which cost $50. So, how much money did Gwen have left after spending money on the dress?  We can calculate it as follows: $7 - $50 = $-43. So, Gwen had $43 left after buying the dress.
Response:  Gwyneth Paltrow was born in September 1972. So, she is currently 50 years old (as of September 2022). Now, let's calculate how much money she has spent on her birthday celebrations over the past 50 years:  In 1972, when Gwyneth was born, $8 dollars were equivalent to around $60 today. So, if we assume that Gwyneth's parents spent $8 on her birthday celebrations back then, it would be equivalent to around $60 today.  Similarly, if we assume that Gwyneth spends $6 on her birthday celebrations every year since then, it would amount to around $360 ($6 x 50 years) today. Therefore, based on these calculations, Gwyneth Paltrow has spent around $420 ($60 + $360) on her birthday celebrations over the past 50 years.
Response:  Gwen's father gave her $4. Now, if she spent $3 of that amount, how much money does she have left?  So, Gwen has $1 left after spending $3.
Response:  Gwen's father gave her $8 as birthday money. If she spent $4 of it, then how much money did she have left from her own savings?  We know that Gwen had $5 from her father and $3 from her own savings, so in total she had $8 + $5 = $13. Therefore, she had $13 - $4 = $9 left after spending $4.
Response:  Gwen's father gave her $6 as a gift. If she spent $4 of that amount, then how much money did she have left from her own savings?  We know that Gwen had $3 in her own savings before receiving the gift from her father. So, after spending $4, she would have $3 - $4 = $1 left in her own savings.
Response:  Gwen's father gave her $5 as a gift. Then, she spent $7 of her own money to buy something. If she had spent $4 more than what her father gave her, then how much money did she have left after buying something? So, let's calculate... $5 (gift from father) - $7 (spent by Gwen) = $2 (money left with Gwen).
Response:  Gwen's father gave her $5 as a gift. Then, she returned $2 to him. If she had spent $6 more than what she received from her father, how much money did she have left with her after returning $2 to him?  We can start by writing an equation based on the information given in the question: Gwen's initial amount = $5 + $6 (spent) =? Total amount = $5 + $6 = $11 Now, we know that Gwen returned $2 to her father, so the amount she had left with her after returning $2 is: $11 - $2 = $9 Therefore, Gwen had $9 left with her after returning $2 to her father.
Response:  Joshko had 9 bullets in his gun and he shot 4 of them. If he had 8 bullets left after shooting those 4, how many bullets did he have initially? So, Joshko had 9 bullets initially.
Response:  Josh ko sangrahmā kehī bulletharū thē. Utsel 21 bulleti gumayo. Yadi ahile usko 12 vatā golā chhanne bhane usko sangrahma kati golā thē. So, the answer is 12.
Response:  Josh ko sangrahmā 19 vatā gōlā thīe. They took out 11 bullets and left with 5 new ones. Now, how many bullets does Josh have? Solution:  Josh has 7 bullets (19 - 11 = 8 + 5).
Response:  Josh ko sangrahmā 4 vatā golā thīe. They then found 16 vatā of gold and buried 8 vatā of it. How much more gold did they find than what they initially had?
"Response:  Josh ko sangrahmā 7 vatā gōlā thīe. They then took 8 vatā gōlā and gave 10 vatā naya pāre. How much more did they gain in gold?

Answer:  The difference between 7 vatā (gained) and 8 vatā (taken) is 1 vata. So, they gained 1 vatā of gold."
Response:  Joshko had 21 balls in his collection and he gave away 7 of them to his friends. So, now he has how many balls left?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of balls Joshko has = Total number of balls - Number of balls given away = 21 - 7 = 14 Therefore, Joshko has 14 balls left in his collection.
Response:  Josh has 20 apples and gives 2 to Jyakala. So, Josh now has 18 apples left. If Jyakala had already 2 apples before receiving the 2 from Josh, then she now has 4 apples (2 + 2). Therefore, the number of apples Josh gave to Jyakala is 18 - 4 = 14 apples.
Response:  Josh has 22 apples and gives 20 to Jack. So, Josh now has 2 - 20 = 2 apples left.
Response:  If Joshua had 11 bullets in his gun and he fired 9 of them, then he has 2 remaining bullets left in his gun.
Response:  Josh ko sangrahamma 22 vata golla thi.  He then gave away 13 vatas of gold to someone else. Now, he has 5 vatas of gold left. So, Josh ko kati gollo chha?  The answer is 5 vatas of gold.
Response:  Josh ko sangrahmā 15 vatā golā thīe. They found 9 vatā gold and lost 23 vatā gold. So they gained 14 vatā gold (9 - 23 = 14).
Response:  Josh ko sangrahmā 3 vatā golā thīe. They had 6 vatā bullets left after shooting 5 vatā gumāeka thīe. Now, they have to shoot another bullet. So, the total number of bullets used by Josh is 6 + 1 = 7 bullets. Therefore, the correct answer is (7)
Response:  Marko had 4 pounds of steak and he gave half of it to his friend. So, Marko now has 2 pounds of steak left.  His friend had 9 pounds of steak, so he now has 9 - 2 = 7 pounds of steak left. Therefore, the difference in weight between what Marko had and what his friend had is 7 pounds.
Response:  Marko had 35 pounds of steak and he gave 13 pounds to his friend Buva. So, now Marko has 22 pounds of steak left (35 - 13 = 22). Now, Buva has 35 pounds of steak (13 + 22 = 35). Therefore, Buva's steak increased by 12 pounds (35 - 22 = 13) compared to what Marko had.
Response:  Marko had 20 pounds of steak and he gave 8 pounds to his friend. So, Marko has 12 pounds of steak left (20 - 8 = 12). Now, if we calculate the weight of Buva's steak, it was 3 times the weight of Marko's steak, so Buva's steak weighed 3 x 12 = 36 pounds. Therefore, the difference between Marko's and Buva's steak weights is 36 - 12 = 24 pounds.
Response:  Marko has 8 pound of steak and he wants to divide it equally among his 4 friends. So, each friend will get 2 pounds of steak (8/4 = 2). Now, let's calculate how much steak Buva will get if she gets 32 pounds of steak from Marko. Since Buva is getting 32 pounds of steak, she will have 32/4 = 8 pounds more than her friends. Therefore, Buva will get 10 pounds of steak (2 + 8 = 10).
Response:  Marko had 24 ponds of strawberries and he sold 9 ponds. So, now he has 15 ponds left (24 - 9 = 15). Now, Bob took 3 ponds from Marko. So, Marko now has 12 ponds left (15 - 3 = 12).
Response:  Marko had 36 pound of strawberries and he gave away 8 pounds to his friend. So, now Marko has 28 pounds of strawberries left. Then, he sold 4 pounds of strawberries at Rs. 10 per pound, so he gained Rs. 40 from that transaction. Now, Marko has 28 + 4 = 32 pounds of strawberries left.
Response:  Marko had 22 pounds of strawberries and he sold them at Rs. 30 per pound. He earned Rs. 660 from selling those strawberries (22 x 30 = 660). Now, Marko bought 30 pounds of strawberries for Rs. 45 per pound. So, he spent Rs. 1350 on buying those strawberries (30 x 45 = 1350). Therefore, his profit is Rs. 660 - Rs. 1350 = Rs. -690.
Response:  Marko has 15 pound of strawberries and he wants to share it equally among his friends. If each friend gets 37 pounds of strawberries, how much will be left for him? So, Marko's remaining strawberry is 37 - 15 = 22 pounds.
Response:  Marko had 30 pounds of steak and he gave 17 pounds to his friend. So, now Marko has 30 - 17 = 13 pounds of steak left.  If his friend's stomach can hold 30 pounds of steak, then Marko's friend's stomach can hold 30 / 2 = 15 pounds of steak.
"Response:  Marko had 10 pounds of steak and he gave 26 pounds to his friend. So, if we want to find out how much more weight Marko gained than his friend, we need to subtract the weight of meat that his friend got from the total weight of meat that Marko had. Therefore, the difference in weight between Marko and his friend is:

Weight of meat given by Marko = 26 pounds
Total weight of meat possessed by Marko = 10 pounds
Difference in weight = Total weight of meat possessed by Marko - Weight of meat given by Marko
= 10 pounds - 26 pounds
= -16 pounds
Therefore, Marko lost 16 pounds of weight."
"Response:  Marko has 11 pounds of strawberries and he wants to share them equally among his friends. If each friend gets 30 pounds of strawberries, then how much will Marko have left?

Answer:
Marko will have 7 pounds (11 - 3 x 30 = 7) of strawberries left after sharing them with his friends."
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then, some of them got off the bus and left 7 children behind. So, initially, there were 2 + 7 = 9 children in the bus. Now, we are asked how many children were in the bus after 10 people got off. Therefore, the number of children who remained in the bus after 10 people got off is 9 - 10 = -1. Hence, there was -1 child in the bus after 10 people got off.
Response:  Basma has 26 children and each child has 38 siblings. So, in total, Basma has 26 x 38 = 944 children. However, only 38 of them are boys, so the number of girls is 906 (944 - 38).
Response:  At first, there were 2 children in the bus. Then, 41 children got off the bus. So, initially, there were 2 + 41 = 43 children in the bus. Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus after getting off 2 children is 43 - 2 = 41.
Response:  Firstly, there were 43 children in Basamra's class. Out of them, only 21 children went to school. So, the number of children who did not go to school is 21 - 43 = -22. Since negative numbers are counted as zero, we can say that exactly 0 children from Basmara's class went to school outside.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in Basamala's class. Out of them, only 8 children went to school. So, the number of children who did not go to school is 33 (41 - 8). Now, out of these 33 children, 18 did not attend school at all. Therefore, the number of children who attended school is 15 (33 - 18).
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in Basamala's house. Then, 10 of them went outside to play and did not come back. So, the number of children left inside the house was 21 - 10 = 11. Therefore, there were 11 children inside Basamala's house.
Response:  Firstly, there are 5 children in Basma's house.  Then, 63 children went out of Basma's house and some of them returned with their parents. So, the number of children who remained outside is 63 - 14 = 50. Therefore, 50 children from Basma's house went outside.
Response:  Firstly, there were 36 babies in Basanta's house. Then, 68 babies went outside and only 5 came back to Basanta's house. So, the total number of babies that Basanta had was 36 + (68 - 5) = 12 babies. Therefore, the correct answer is 12 babies.
Response:  Firstly, there are 22 people in Basmala's family.  Secondly, out of these 22 people, 40% (or 9) are children. Therefore, the number of children in Basmala's family is 9. Now, we need to find out how many of them went outside. Since 3/4 th of the total number of people in Basmala's family went outside, and there are 9 children in her family, then 7 children (i.e., 3/4 th of 9) went outside. So, the answer is 7.
Response:  Firstly, there are 28 children in Basmala's class.  Secondly, out of these 28 children, 8 children are absent from school due to fever. Therefore, the total number of children present at school is 28 - 8 = 20. Thirdly, among these 20 children, 4 children have gone outside to play. So, the remaining 16 children are inside the school building. Hence, the final answer is 16.
Response:  We know that there are 23 boys and 24 girls in Basmala's class. So, the total number of students in Basmala's class is 23 + 24 = 47. Now, we are asked how many students went to school after Basmala. Since Basmata took 8 students with her, the remaining 40 students did not go to school with her. Therefore, the number of students who went to school with Basmala is 8.
"Response:  If they sold 133 units of beads at Rs.51 each, then their total revenue would be:

Revenue = Number of units x Price per unit
= 133 x 51
= Rs.6,793
Now, if they want to make a profit of Rs.2000, we need to subtract the cost price from the revenue:
Cost price = Revenue x Profit percentage
= Rs.6,793 x 20%
= Rs.1,358
So, they can sell around 135-140 units of beads to make a profit of Rs.2000."
Response:  We have to find out how many vats of rice Beckerle can make with 54 vats of rice he has. He sells each vat for Rs 1300. If he wants to earn as much money as possible, how many vats should he sell? Solution: To maximize his profit, Beckerle should sell all 54 vats of rice. This way, he will earn a total of Rs 7,260 (54 x Rs 1300). So, the answer is 54 vats.
Response:  We know that Beckerle sold 145 watermelons and earned Rs 870. If he had 72 more watermelons, how many would he have in total? So, Beckerle has 217 watermelons (145 + 72) in total.
Response:  If he has Rs.155 in his bank account and he withdraws Rs.140, then he will have Rs.155 - Rs.140 = Rs.15 left in his account.
Response:  We know that 121 watermelons were sold and out of those, 105 watermelons were old ones. So, the number of new watermelons sold is: New watermelons = Old watermelons - Sold old watermelons = 105 - 121 = -16 watermelons. Therefore, there are 16 fewer new watermelons than old watermelons.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many vats of beer were sold by Barley. From the given information, we know that Barley sold 13 vats of beer and earned Rs 910 as revenue. Now, let's calculate the price per vat of beer. We know that Barley sold 91 vats of beer in total, so the price per vat of beer is: Price per vat = Total revenue / Number of vats sold = Rs 910 / 91 = Rs 10 per vat So, if Barley sold 13 vats of beer at Rs 10 per vat, he earned a total amount of: Amount earned = Number of vats x Price per vat = 13 x Rs 10 = Rs 130 Therefore, the amount that Barley earned from selling those 13 vats of beer was Rs 130.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Beckerle sold 107 watermelons and bought 78 new ones. So, he gained 29 watermelons (78 - 59 = 29). Now, let's calculate how much money Beckerle made from selling those 29 watermelons. Since each watermelon costs Rs 31, Beckerle earned Rs 879 (29 x 31 = 879) from selling those watermelons. Therefore, Beckerle's total profit is Rs 879 + Rs 29 = Rs 908.
"Response:  The first transaction involved buying 110 watermelons and selling them for 75 watermelons each. So, the total amount earned from this transaction was:

110 watermelons x 75 watermelons/watermelon = 8250 watermelons

Now, in the second transaction, they bought 76 watermelons and sold them for 80 watermelons each. So, the total amount earned from this transaction was:

76 watermelons x 80 watermelons/watermelon = 6080 watermelons

So, the difference between the two transactions is:

8250 - 6080 = 2170 watermelons

Therefore, the number of watermelons Becker got back after both transactions is 2170 watermelons."
Response:  Firstly, they sold 144 vats of beer at Rs. 71 per vat, which means they earned Rs. 9,856 (144 x 71). Then, they sold 111 more vats of beer at the same price, which means they earned an additional Rs. 8,326 (111 x 71). Therefore, in total, they earned Rs. 18,182 (9,856 + 8,326) from selling those two batches of beer.
Response:  If he sold 10 keys for Rs. 91 each and bought 149 keys at Rs. 85 each, then his total cost of buying those keys would be: Total Cost = Number of Keys x Price per Key = 149 x 85 = Rs. 12,675 Now, if he sold all 10 keys for Rs. 91 each, then his total revenue from selling those keys would be: Total Revenue = Number of Keys x Sale Price per Key = 10 x 91 = Rs. 910 So, his profit (or loss) can be calculated as follows: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = 910 - 12,675 = Rs. -11,765 He has incurred a loss of Rs. 11,765.
Response:  We have to find out how many pastries Becker can make with 7 cups of flour and 148 grams of sugar.  Firstly, we need to convert the volume of flour from cups to grams. There are 200 grams in 1 cup, so 7 cups of flour is equal to 1400 grams (7 x 200 = 1400). Now, let's calculate the weight of sugar required for making 7 cups of pastry dough. Since there are 150 grams of sugar in 1 cup, we need 2100 grams (148 / 150) of sugar for 7 cups of pastry dough. Therefore, Becker can make 7 + 2100 = 2107 pastries with the given ingredients.
Response:  We have to find out how many beads are in each row of the basket and then calculate the total number of beads in all rows.  The question states that there are 126 vati (baskets) containing 48 peshtee (beads) each. So, the total number of beads in one vati is: 126 vati x 48 peshtee/vati = 5732 peshtee. Now, we need to find out how many rows are there in each vati. Let's assume that each vati has 11 rows of beads, as stated in the question. Then, the total number of rows in all 126 vatis is: 126 vati x 11 rows/vati = 1391 rows. Finally, we can calculate the total number of beads in all rows by multiplying the number of rows with the number of beads in each row: 1391 rows x 5732 peshtee/row = 760656 peshtee. Therefore, the answer to the question is 760656 peshtee.
Response:  We have to find out how many pastries Beckerle can make with 19 wat and 131 wat of flour.  If he sells each pastry for Rs 70 and makes a profit of Rs 8 per pastry, then we need to calculate the number of pastries that will give him the maximum profit.  So, let's do some calculations:  Number of pastries = Total weight of flour / Weight of one pastry x Profit per pastry  = 19 wat / 250 g (weight of one pastry) x Rs 8/pastry  = 760 pastries  Now, if Beckerle sells 760 pastries, he will make a total profit of Rs 5,920 (760 x Rs 8/pastry).
Response:  If they sold 157 keys at Rs. 169 each and had 147 pieces of pastries to sell, then their total revenue from both sales would be: Revenue from key sales = Number of keys x Price per key = 157 x 169 = 26,333 Revenue from pastry sales = Number of pastries x Price per piece = 147 x 147 = 20,899 Total revenue = Revenue from key sales + Revenue from pastry sales = 26,333 + 20,899 = 47,232 Now, if they sold 158 keys instead of 157, their new total revenue would be: New total revenue = Revenue from key sales + Revenue from pastry sales = 26,333 + 20,899 = 47,232 + 1,000 = 48,232 So, the increase in revenue due to selling one more key is Rs. 1,000 (48,232 - 47,232).
"Response:  We know that 54 vats of beer and 143 vats of paste are available for sale. If they sell 68 kegs of beer and 92 kegs of paste, how many kegs will they have left to sell?

Answer:

Total number of vats = 54 + 143 = 197 vats
Sold quantity of beer = 68 kegs x 30 liters/keg = 2040 liters
Sold quantity of paste = 92 kegs x 10 liters/keg = 920 liters
Remaining quantity of beer = Total number of vats - Sold quantity of beer = 197 - 2040 = 1853 liters
Remaining quantity of paste = Total number of vats - Sold quantity of paste = 197 - 920 = 1053 liters"
"Response:  If they sold 44 watermelons at Rs. 8 per kg, then they earned a total of:

44 x 8 = Rs. 352

Now, if they had 48 watermelons and gave away 4 free watermelons, then their remaining quantity would be:

48 - 4 = 44 watermelons

So, the number of watermelons they have after giving away 4 free ones is:

44

Therefore, the correct answer is:

44"
Response:  If they had sold 80 vats of beer at Rs. 40 per vat, then their total revenue would have been: 80 vats x Rs. 40 per vat = Rs. 3200. Now, if they had to sell 40 vats more at the same price, their additional revenue would be: 40 vats x Rs. 40 per vat = Rs. 1600. So, in total, they would have earned Rs. 3200 + Rs. 1600 = Rs. 4800 from selling those extra 40 vats of beer.
"Response:  If they had 137 rupees initially and spent 169 rupees, then their remaining balance would be:

Remaining Balance = Initial Amount - Spent Amount
= 137 - 169
= -32

So, they have a negative balance of Rs 32."
Response:  We have to find out how many vats of beer were brewed and sold.  Firstly, we know that 173 vats of beer were brewed. Out of these, 103 vats were new and 70 vats were old. So, the number of new vats of beer brewed is 103. Now, we need to find out how many vats of beer were sold. From the given information, we know that 86 vats of beer were sold. Therefore, the difference between the total number of vats of beer brewed and the number of vats sold is 86 - 103 = -17 vats. Since the result is negative, it means that there are 17 more vats of beer unsold than brewed.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many vats of rice Beckerle sold in total. From the question, we know that he sold 99 vats of rice and earned Rs. 1670. So, the total number of vats of rice sold by Beckerle is:

99 vats x Rs. 1670 = Total sales revenue

Now, let's find out how much profit Beckerle made from each vat of rice. We know that he sold 89 vats of rice at Rs. 234 each, so the total amount of money he earned from these vats is:

89 vats x Rs. 234 = Profit from selling 89 vats

Now, let's subtract the profit from selling 89 vats from the total sales revenue to find out how much profit Beckerle made overall:

Total sales revenue - Profit from selling 89 vats = Overall profit

So, the overall profit made by Beckerle is:

Rs. 1670 - Rs. 2057 = Rs. (-) 388

Therefore, Beckerle lost around Rs. 388 on each vat of rice he sold."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many vats of beer can be made from 8 vats of water. Since 1 vat of beer requires 3 liters of water, we can make 8 x 3 = 24 liters of beer from 8 vats of water. Now, let's assume that out of these 24 liters, 139 liters are sold at Rs. 145 per liter and remaining 106 liters are sold at Rs. 139 per liter. Therefore, total revenue generated is: Revenue = Number of liters sold x Price per liter = 139 liters x Rs. 145 per liter = Rs. 18,775 Total revenue = Rs. 18,775 So, the profit earned is: Profit = Total revenue - Cost = Rs. 18,775 - (Cost of producing 1 vat of beer) =? To find the cost of producing 1 vat of beer, we need to divide the total cost of production by the number of vats produced. According to the question, the total cost of production is Rs. 139 per liter. Therefore, the cost of producing 1 vat of beer is: Cost of producing 1 vat of beer = Total cost of production / Number of vats produced = Rs. 139 / 24 = Rs. 5.63 per liter So, the profit earned is: Profit = Rs. 18,775 - (Rs. 5.63 per liter x Number of liters sold) = Rs. 18,775 - (Rs. 5.63 x 139 liters) = Rs. 18,775 - Rs. 7,932 = Rs. 10,843 Therefore, the profit earned is Rs. 10,843.
Response:  We know that 62 vats of beer were brewed and then 149 vats were sold. So, there is a difference of 87 vats between the two quantities. Now, we are asked how many vats of beer were left after selling 144 vats. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of vats sold from the total quantity brewed. Therefore, the answer is 33 vats of beer were left after selling 144 vats.
Response:  We know that 81 vats of beer were brewed and then 92 vats were sold. So, there is a difference of 11 vats (92 - 81). Now, we are asked how much more beer was brewed than sold. To find this, we need to subtract the number of vats sold from the total number of vats brewed. Therefore, the answer is: 11 vats.
Response:  We have to find out how many rupees will be gained if 61 vats of rice are sold at Rs. 108 per vat and 167 vats of rice are sold at Rs. 44 per vat. So, total amount earned from selling these two lots of rice is: Total Amount = Number of Vats x Price Per Vat = 61 vats x Rs. 108/vat + 167 vats x Rs. 44/vat = Rs. 6,592 + Rs. 736 = Rs. 7,328 Therefore, the difference between the cost price and the selling price is Rs. 7,328 - Rs. 6,592 = Rs. 736.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pastries and cookies are available for sale based on the given information.  From the question, we know that there are 56 vats of pastries and 124 vats of cookies.  Since each vat contains 80 pieces, the total number of pastries is:

56 vats x 80 pieces/vat = 4320 pastries

Similarly, the total number of cookies is:

124 vats x 80 pieces/vat = 9760 cookies

Now, let's calculate the percentage of pastries and cookies sold. To do this, we need to divide the number of pastries or cookies sold by the total number of pastries or cookies available for sale. For pastries, the percentage sold is:

(104 pastries / 4320 pastries) x 100% = 24%

For cookies, the percentage sold is:

(29 cookies / 9760 cookies) x 100% = 3%

Therefore, if they sell 104 pastries and 29 cookies, they will have 76% of their pastries and 97% of their cookies left in stock."
Response:  We have to find out how many posts and pastries Beckerle can make with 52 vats of paste and 84 kilograms of flour.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of posts that Beckerle can make with 52 vats of paste. Since each vat contains 102 grams of paste, Beckerle can make 52 x 102 = 5200 grams of posts. Now, let's convert this amount into units of pastries. Since one gram of post is equal to 0.0375 pastries (as per the given information), Beckerle can make 5200 / 0.0375 = 1369 pastries from 52 vats of paste. Next, we need to calculate the number of pastries Beckerle can make with 84 kilograms of flour. Since one kilogram of flour makes approximately 375 grams of dough (as per the given information), Beckerle can make 84 x 375 = 30,000 grams of dough. Now, let's convert this amount into units of pastries. Since one gram of dough is equal to 0.0375 pastries (as per the given information), Beckerle can make 30,000 / 0.0375 = 811 pastries from 84 kilograms of flour. Therefore, the total number of pastries Beckerle can make is 1369 + 811 = 2180 pastries. So, the answer is 2180 pastries.
Response:  We have to find out how many pastries Beckerle can make with 134 eggs and 110 kecks (a unit of measurement for flour).  If he sells each pastry at Rs.92, then he will earn Rs.106 per pastry. So, if he makes 140 pastries with eggs and bakes them, he will earn Rs.140 x 106 = Rs.14,520 in total. Now, let's calculate how much profit he will make by selling 110 kecks. Since each keck costs Rs.10, Beckerle will spend Rs.10 x 110 = Rs.1,100 on flour alone. So, his total cost will be Rs.1,100 + Rs.14,520 = Rs.15,620. This means that he will make a profit of Rs.15,620 - Rs.1,100 = Rs.14,520. Therefore, Beckerle can make approximately 117 pastries with 134 eggs and sell them to make a profit of around Rs.14,520.
Response:  We have to find out how much percentage increase in price of pastries Beckerle can afford to give if he wants to sell 14 vats of pastries at Rs. 8 per vat and earn a profit of Rs. 973.  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of one vat of pastries = (Number of vats x Price per vat) / 100 = Rs. 8 x 14/100 = Rs. 112 So, the total cost price of selling 14 vats of pastries is = Rs. 112 x 14 = Rs. 1568 Now, let's find out the desired profit = Profit = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 973 - Rs. 1568 = Rs. (-415) As Beckerle cannot afford to give a negative profit, we need to adjust the selling price accordingly. To find the new selling price, we divide the desired profit by the number of vats sold = New selling price = Desired profit / Number of vats sold = Rs. 973 / 14 = Rs. 69 per vat Therefore, Beckerle can afford to give an increase of approximately 69% in the price of pastries to make a profit of Rs. 973 while selling 14 vats of pastries.
Response:  We know that 43 vats of beer were sold at Rs. 114 per vat, and 154 vats of beer were sold at Rs. 78 per vat. So, if they had sold 114 vats of beer at Rs. 78 per vat, how many vats of beer would they have sold in total? Solution: Total number of vats of beer sold = Number of vats of beer sold at Rs. 78 per vat x Total amount earned from selling beer at Rs. 78 per vatTotal number of vats of beer sold = 114 vats x Rs. 78 per vat = Rs. 86,920So, the total number of vats of beer sold is Rs. 86,920.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 22 can be divided into 40. So, we need to divide 22 by 40. When we divide 22 by 40, we get 0.55. Therefore, there are 0.55 times or 55 games that Kelsi can play with her friends.
"Response:  If they have 106 votes and they want to distribute them among 64 candidates, then each candidate will get:

$$ \frac{106}{64} = 1.67 $$

So, each candidate will get $1.67$ votes."
Response:  If they can play 91 games in 24 hours, then they will have played 3.75 games per hour (91/24). Now, if they had played 92 games earlier and want to know how many more games they could have played, we need to subtract the number of games they already played from the total number of possible games they could have played. So, the difference between 92 and 91 is 1 game. Therefore, they could have played 1 extra game if they had played for 24 hours after playing 92 games earlier.
Response:  We have 20 watermelons and we want to distribute them equally among 70 people. To do this, each person will get 3 watermelons (20/70 = 3). Now, let's assume that there are 12 watermelons left over after distribution. So, the remaining amount of watermelons is 12 - 3 = 9 watermelons.
Response:  We have 46 vats of rice and we want to distribute them equally among 132 people so that each person gets 31 vats of rice. So, we need to divide 46 vats by 132 people.  Therefore, the answer is 0.35 vat per person.
"Response:  We know that there are 80 notes in total and we have to find out how many notes are left after playing 31 notes. So, the number of notes left is:

80 - 31 = 49

Now, we need to find out how many notes are played in each game. From the question, we know that there are 6 games in total and each game has 5 notes played. Therefore, the total number of notes played in all 6 games is:

6 x 5 = 30

So, the remaining notes after playing all 6 games are:

49 - 30 = 19

Therefore, the answer is 19 notes are left after playing all 6 games."
Response:  We know that Ryandik has 52 blocks and he wants to make a tower of height 38 blocks. So, we need to find out how many blocks Ryandik can place in each layer of the tower.  If we divide 38 blocks by 52 blocks per layer, we get 0.73 layers (or 73% full). Therefore, if Ryandik places 38 blocks at a time, he will be able to build 38 / 0.73 = 51 layers of the tower.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks of size 97 can be made from 72 blocks of size 100. To do this, we need to divide 72 by 100 and round off the result to the nearest whole number. So, there are approximately 7.4 blocks of size 97 that can be made from 72 blocks of size 100.
Response:  Ryan has 79 blocks and he uses 14 blocks for each of his two towers. So, he needs 14 x 2 = 28 blocks for both towers. And he has 79 - 28 = 51 blocks left. Therefore, there are 51 blocks remaining after building the two towers.
Response:  Ryandiko has 58 blocks and he wants to build two structures with different sizes. One structure requires 27 blocks and another one requires 33 blocks. So, Ryandiko will have 10 blocks left after building both structures.
Response:  Ryan has 37 blocks and wants to build a house with 33 blocks and a tower with 13 blocks. To calculate how many blocks he will have left after building the house and the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for each structure from the total number of blocks available.  For the house, Ryan needs 33 blocks, so he will have 37 - 33 = 4 blocks left.  For the tower, he needs 13 blocks, so he will have 4 - 13 = -9 blocks left (since negative numbers indicate that he has more blocks than he started with). Therefore, Ryan will have a total of 4 + (-9) = 5 blocks left after building both structures.
Response:  Ryan has 86 blocks and he wants to build a house with 79 blocks and a tower with 23 blocks. So, he will have 14 blocks left over after building both the house and the tower.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks of size 36 wat will be required to fill 59 wat space. To do this, we need to divide 59 by 36, which gives us 1.62 blocks. So, approximately 1.62 blocks will be required to fill the given space.
Response:  Ryan has 95 blocks and wants to build a house with 20 blocks and a tower with 50 blocks. To calculate how many blocks he will have left after building these structures, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for each structure from the total number of blocks he has.  For the house, Ryan needs 20 blocks, so he will have 95 - 20 = 75 blocks left.  For the tower, he needs 50 blocks, so he will have 75 - 50 = 25 blocks left. Therefore, Ryan will have 25 blocks left after building both the house and the tower.
"Response:  Ryan has 90 blocks and he wants to build a house with 89 blocks and a tower with 63 blocks. So, how many blocks will be left after building the house and the tower?

Response:  If there are 20 different books in the library and you have read 5 of them, then the probability that the next book you pick is one of the remaining 15 books is (15/20) = 0.75 or 75%. So, if you pick another book after reading the fifth one, the probability that it is one of the remaining 10 books is (10/20) = 0.5 or 50%. Therefore, the probability that you will pick a book that you haven't read before among the remaining 10 books is (9/20) = 0.45 or 45%.
Response:  If Tya has read 13 books and wants to know how many more books she needs to read to catch up with her classmates who have read 8 books, then we need to calculate the difference between their number of books read and Tya's number of books read. So, the difference is: 13 - 8 = 5 books. Therefore, Tya needs to read 5 more books to catch up with her classmates.
Response:  If Tapainle reads 12 books and watches 56 movies, then they have spent a total of 68 hours (12 x 6 = 72) reading or watching things.  So, if Tapainle spends an average of 4 hours per day on reading or watching things, then they will spend 17 days (68/4 = 17) doing so.
"Response:  If there are 4 books and 17 movies that Tya has watched, then the total number of things Tya has consumed is:

Books = 4
Movies = 17
Total = Books + Movies = 4 + 17 = 21
So, Tya has consumed 21 things in total."
"Response:  If there are 16 books and 14 movies in the school library, then the total number of items in the library is:

Books = 16
Movies = 14
Total Items = Books + Movies = 16 + 14 = 30
So, there are 30 items in the school library."
Response:  If there are 8 books and 10 movies in the school library, then the total number of items in the library is: 8 + 10 = 18.  Now, if we have to choose 19 books and 61 movies from the library, then the remaining number of books and movies left in the library will be: 18 - 19 = 9 books and 51 movies.
Response:  If Tapainle reads 13 books and watches 12 movies, then they have spent a total of 13 + 12 = 25 hours.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total time as follows: 25 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1500 minutes.  So, Tapainle has spent 1500 minutes (or 25 hours) consuming media content.
"Response:  If Tya has read 11 books and watched 17 movies, then she has spent a total of 11 + 17 = 28 hours watching or reading things.  Now, if we assume that each book takes an average of 4 hours to read (which is a rough estimate) and each movie takes an average of 2 hours to watch (also a rough estimate), then we can calculate how many days Tya would have spent reading or watching things as follows:

Books: Total time spent = Number of books x Time per book = 28 hours / 11 books = 2.5 days
Movies: Total time spent = Number of movies x Time per movie = 28 hours / 17 movies = 1.6 days
So, in total, Tya would have spent around 2.5 + 1.6 = 4.1 days consuming various forms of media."
Response:  If there are 8 books in total and we have to read 8 of them from 'Tapain's Mental School' shelf, then the number of books left on that shelf is: 8 - 8 = 0. So, there are no books left on Tapain's mental school shelf.
Response:  If Tya has read 62 books and watched 19 videos, then she has spent a total of 81 minutes (62 x 30 seconds/book) reading and 1375 minutes (19 x 70 minutes/video) watching. Therefore, if Tya spends an additional 4 minutes reading and 34 minutes watching, she will have spent a total of 85 minutes reading and 411 minutes watching.
Response:  If Tya has read 8 books and watched 21 videos, then she has spent a total of 8 + 21 = 29 hours studying.  Since each book takes an average of 7 hours to read, Tya has spent 8 x 7 = 56 hours reading books.  Similarly, since each video takes an average of 4 hours to watch, Tya has spent 21 x 4 = 84 hours watching videos. Therefore, Tya has spent a total of 56 + 84 = 140 hours studying.
Response:  If there are 14 pictures of farmers and 15 pictures of animals in the book, then there will be a total of 29 pictures (14 + 15) in the book.
"Response:  If there are 17 books and 11 movies in the school library, then the total number of items in the library is:

17 x 1 = 17 books + 11 x 1 = 11 movies = 28 items

So, out of the 28 items in the library, the number of books that are not movies is:

28 - 11 = 17 books (not movies)

Therefore, among the 13 books that you can read during your lunch break, 17 books (not movies) are available for reading in the library."
Response:  If Tapainle reads 10 books and watches 6 movies in school, that means they have spent a total of 16 hours (10 x 2 = 20 + 6 x 2 = 12) watching movies or reading books.  Therefore, if Tapainle spends 14 hours studying for their exams, they will have studied for 2 hours more than the time they spent watching movies or reading books (14 - 16 = -2).
Response:  We have to find out how many books and comics are there in total.  There are 8 books and 5 comics. So, the total number of items is 8 + 5 = 13. Therefore, we can read 19 books (16 x 1.2) and watch 16 movies (13 x 1.2).
Response:  We have 7 tickets in total and we want to distribute them among 4 people. So, each person will get 1 3/4 ticket (7 / 4 = 1 3/4). Now, let's say that out of these 4 people, 2 are able to attend the event. So, they will get 2/3 of the remaining tickets (7 - 2 = 5), which is equal to 2 tickets. Therefore, the answer is 2 tickets.
Response:  We know that Debal has 12 tickets and he wants to buy 14 more tickets. So, in total, Debal will have 26 tickets (12 + 14). Now, we need to find out how many tickets Deble will get if he buys 14 more tickets than his current number of tickets. Therefore, Deble will get 30 tickets (26 - 14 = 30).
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Debal will get if he wins 18 votes and spends 5 votes for campaigning. So, we need to calculate the number of tickets left after subtracting the cost of campaigning from the total number of votes won.  Total number of votes won = 18 votes + (5 votes / 2) = 18 + 2.5 = 20.5 votes. Now, let's see how many tickets Debal can get based on his vote share. If he gets 20.5 votes out of 30 votes (which is the total number of votes in the election), then his ticket-to-vote ratio would be: Ticket-to-vote ratio = Number of tickets obtained / Total number of votes cast = 20.5 / 30 = 0.67 tickets per vote. Since there are 30 voters in the election, Debal will get approximately 6.7 tickets if he wins all the votes.
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Debal can buy with his money of Rs 1900. Since he has Rs 1200 left after buying 12 tickets, we can calculate the number of tickets he can buy as follows: Number of tickets = Remaining amount / Cost of each ticket So, the number of tickets Debal can buy is: Number of tickets = Rs 1200 / Rs 70 (cost of one ticket) = 17 tickets Now, let's see what happens if Debal buys 7 kurtas instead of 7 tickets. As per the question, if he buys 7 kurtas, he will have Rs 70 left. So, the number of tickets Debal can buy now is: Number of tickets = Remaining amount / Cost of each ticket So, the number of tickets Debal can buy is: Number of tickets = Rs 70 / Rs 70 (cost of one ticket) = 1 ticket Therefore, Debal can buy 17 tickets or 1 kura.
"Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Debal will get if he wins 13 lotteries and how much money he will get from each ticket. Then we need to calculate how much money he will gain from selling his old clothes and how much he will lose in buying new clothes. Finally, we need to determine how much money he will have after all these calculations are done.

So, let's start with the first part of the question - How many tickets will Debal win if he wins 13 lotteries?

Debal will win 13 lotteries, so he will get 13 x 8 = 104 tickets.

Now, let's move on to the second part of the question - How much money will Debal get from each ticket?

Each ticket is worth Rs. 8, so Debal will get Rs. 8 x 104 = Rs. 826 total amount from all the tickets he won.

Next, let's consider the third part of the question - How much money will Debal gain from selling his old clothes?

Debal has 8 old clothes, and each cloth costs Rs. 500. So, Debal will gain Rs. 500 x 8 = Rs. 4000 from selling his old clothes.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Debal will lose in buying new clothes.

Debal wants to buy 8 new clothes, and each cloth costs Rs. 800. So, Debal will lose Rs. 800 x 8 = Rs. 6400 from buying new clothes.

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find out how much money Debal will have after all these calculations are done.

Rs. 826 (from winning lotteries) + Rs. 4000 (from selling old clothes) - Rs. 6400 (from buying new clothes) = Rs. 7964

Therefore, Debal will have Rs. 7964 after all the calculations are done."
Response:  If they had taken 14 tickets and lost 2, then they have 12 tickets left (14 - 2 = 12). Now, if they took 10 more tickets and lost some of them, they will have X number of tickets left, where X is the difference between the total number of tickets they took and the number of tickets they lost. So, in this case, X = 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, they have 10 tickets left.
Response:  We have 14 ropes of length 9 meters each. If we cut one end of each rope, how many meters will be left? So, the total length of all the ropes after cutting their ends is 14 x 9 = 126 meters. Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in length. The increase in length is (126 - 9) / 9 = 38%. Therefore, the length of each rope increased by 38% after cutting their ends.
Response:  We have 13 ropes of length 6 meters each. So, in total, we have 13 x 6 = 78 meters of rope. Now, let's calculate how many times the height of the tree (which is 20 meters) can be covered with these ropes. Therefore, the number of layers of ropes that can cover the height of the tree is 78 / 20 = 3.9 layers.
Response:  We have 20 water bottles of 5 liters each, so in total we have 20 x 5 = 100 liters of water. Now, if we pour 3 liters of water from one container to another, we will be left with 97 liters (100 - 3). If we repeat this process 4 times, we will have poured out 3 x 4 = 12 liters of water, leaving us with 88 liters (97 - 12). So, after 4 rounds of pouring, all the water will be gone and there will be no water left in any of the containers. Therefore, option B is correct.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 12 watermelons. Firstly, we need to calculate the volume of one watermelon. The average weight of a watermelon is around 5 kg (based on my research). So, if we divide the weight of one watermelon by its volume, we get the volume of one watermelon in cubic centimeters (cm³): Volume of one watermelon = 5 kg / 0.001 m³ = 5000 cm³ Now, let's calculate the total volume of 12 watermelons: Total volume of 12 watermelons = 12 x 5000 cm³ = 60,000 cm³ Next, we need to convert this volume from cubic centimeters to liters. There are 1000 cm³ in one liter, so: Total volume of 12 watermelons in liters = 60,000 cm³ / 1000 = 60 liters Finally, we can use this value to determine how many bags of rice can be filled with 12 watermelons. Based on the information provided earlier, each bag of rice can hold approximately 20 kg (or 0.02 m³) of rice. Therefore, we can fill: Number of bags of rice that can be filled with 12 watermelons = Total volume of 12 watermelons / Volume of one bag of rice = 60 liters / 0.02 m³ = 300 bags of rice So, if you had 12 watermelons and wanted to fill them into bags of rice, you could fit approximately 300 bags of rice into them!
Response:  We have 9 vats of water and we need to fill 4 tanks. So, we will use 3 vats for each tank. Now, we have 3 x 9 = 27 vats left. After filling 4 tanks, we will have 27 - 12 = 15 vats left.
Response:  If we take 12 vats of water and pour it into an empty bag, then initially there will be no bags in the bag. So, the number of bags that can fit in the bag is 0. Now, if we add 12 vats of water to the already filled bag, then the total volume of water in the bag becomes 12 + 12 = 24 vats. Since the bag has a capacity of 15 vats, now there are 9 vats of water left over (24 - 15 = 9). Therefore, the number of bags that can fit in the bag after adding 12 vats of water is 9.
Response:  If we take 13 vats of water and pour it into an empty container with a capacity of 3 vats, how much water will be left in the original container afterward?  Since there are 4 vats remaining in the original container (13 - 3 = 4), so 4 vats of water will remain in the original container after pouring 13 vats into another container.
Response:  If we start with 11 vats of water and pour it into the well, the depth of the water in the well will increase by 11 buckets. Now, if we add another 11 buckets of water to the well after the first batch has filled it up to its brim, then the total depth of water in the well will be equal to 22 buckets (i.e., 11 + 11). So, the answer is 22.
"Response:  If each borrower can repay Rs. 28 per day as interest, and there are 66 borrowers in total, then the total amount of interest that they owe is:

Interest owed = Number of borrowers x Daily interest rate
= 66 x Rs. 28/day
= Rs. 1792/day

So, if each borrower can repay Rs. 28 per day as interest, then the total amount of interest that they owe is Rs. 1792/day."
Response:  The daily income of the person is Rs.800 and they have to pay Rs.240 as rent. So, their remaining amount after paying rent is Rs.560 (Rs.800 - Rs.240). Now, if they want to save Rs.1000 in 8 days, they will need to save Rs.125 per day (Rs.1000 / 8 = Rs.125). Therefore, it will take them 24 days (Rs.125 x 8 = Rs.900) to save Rs.1000.
Response:  If they cut 46 bundles of straw in 3 days, then they must have cut __________ bundles per day.
Response:  We know that there are 38 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a week is 38 x 24 = 864 hours. Now, we need to calculate how many hours are left after working for 49 days continuously. Total hours worked in 49 days is 49 x 24 = 1156 hours. Therefore, the remaining hours are 864 - 1156 = -302 hours.
"Response:  The daily wage of each worker is Rs. 66 per day and they work for 8 hours a day. Therefore, their total earnings in one week (7 days) are:

Weekly Earnings = Daily Wage x Number of Days worked
= Rs. 66 x 7
= Rs. 452

Now, let's calculate how many sundials they can make in a month (30 days):

Monthly Sundials = Weekly Earnings x Number of Months
= Rs. 452 x 30
= 13,560 sundials

Therefore, if there are 8 workers, they can make:

Total Sundials = Number of Workers x Monthly Sundials
= 8 x 13,560
= 104,480 sundials

So, in 87 days (87 x 8 = 696), the workers can make 104,480 sundials."
Response:  We know that there are 8 hours in a day and 35 weeks in a year. So, if someone works for 8 hours a day, they will work for 240 hours (8 x 30) in a month. Therefore, in a year, they will work for 7,200 hours (240 x 30).
Response:  We know that there are 16 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a week is: 16 x 24 = 432 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyasapchi worked in a month. According to the question, he worked for 57 weeks, which means he worked for: 57 x 432 = 24,904 hours. Therefore, Tyasapchi worked for 24,904 hours in a month.
Response:  If they can collect 67 apples per day and each apple weighs 120 grams, then in total they will have collected 67 x 35 = 2495 grams of apples per day.
Response:  We know that there are 74 trees in the forest and they need to be cut down in 31 days. So, we have to cut down 2 trees per day on average. Now, let's calculate how many trees will be left after 51 days. If we cut down 2 trees per day, then after 51 days, we will have cut down a total of 102 trees (51 x 2 = 102). Therefore, after 51 days, there will be 68 trees left in the forest (74 - 102 = 68).
"Response:  If each bar of chocolate weighs 50 grams and there are 76 bars in total, then the total weight of all the chocolates is:

76 bars x 50 grams/bar = 3800 grams

Now, if they managed to sell 64 bars, then the remaining weight of chocolates is:

3800 grams - (64 bars x 50 grams/bar) = 1920 grams

So, the amount of chocolate left after selling 64 bars is 1920 grams."
"Response:  We know that there are 28 days in a month and 12 months in a year. So, if we calculate the total number of days in a leap year (365 days), it will be:

Total number of days = Number of days in a non-leap year x Number of months in a non-leap year + Number of days in a leap year
= 30 days/month x 12 months + 365 days
= 3945 days

Now, let's find out how many days are left after cutting 28 days from each month:

Number of days left = Total number of days - Number of days cut from each month
= 3945 days - (28 days x 12 months)
= 3945 days - 336 days
= 3609 days

So, after cutting 28 days from each month for 26 years, there will be 3609 days left."
Response:  We know that there are 82 days in a year and 61 days are safe from landslides. So, if we want to calculate how many days it will take for the remaining 21 days (which are unsafe) to be affected by landslides, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of days x Percentage of days unsafe  Therefore, the calculation is as follows: Number of days = 82 x 21 / 100 = 1754 days  Now, let's convert this value into months: Number of months = 1754 days / 30 days per month = 58.49 months  Finally, round up the result to the nearest whole number: Number of months = 59 months  Therefore, based on the given information, it will take approximately 59 months (or about 4.8 years) for the remaining 21 days of the year to be affected by landslides after the construction of the retaining wall.
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and April together, so we have to subtract these days from the total number of days given in the question. Therefore, the remaining days after subtracting 31 days = 24 days x 45 days = 1080 days. So, the answer is 1080 days.
Response:  According to the given information, each day, 44 sun hours are available and 25 sun hours are wasted due to cloud cover. So, the total number of sun hours available per day is 44. Now, we need to find out how many sun hours are harvested per day. To do this, we will divide the total number of sun hours available per day (44) by the number of sun hours that can be harnessed per day (39). Therefore, the number of sun hours harvested per day is: 44 / 39 = 11.03 sun hours per day.
"Response:  According to the given information, we have:

Total number of days in a month = 30
Number of days for which sunlight is available = 5
Number of days for which sunlight is not available (i.e., cloudy) = 74

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours of sunlight per day:

Total number of hours of sunlight per day = Total number of days x Number of hours of sunlight per day
= 30 x 5
= 150 hours

So, there are 150 hours of sunlight per day on average."
Response:  If they had cut 54 bundles of straw in 18 days, then they would have cut __________ bundles per day.
Response:  If they had cut 56 trees in 14 days, then they would have cut approximately 4 trees per day.
Response:  We know that the farmer has to plough 25 bighas of land every day and earn Rs. 5 per bigha. So, he will earn Rs. 125 per day (25 x 5 = 125). Now, we need to calculate how many days it takes for him to plough all 73 bighas of land. To do this, we divide the total area of land (73 bighas) by the daily area he can plough (25 bighas): 73 / 25 = 3days Therefore, it will take the farmer 3 days to plough all 73 bighas of land.
"Response:  We know that in 6 days, they can dig 65 borewells and in 46 days, they can dig 480 borewells. So, if they work for 7 days, they will be able to dig how many borewells?

Answer:  They will be able to dig 7 \* 65 = 455 borewells in 7 days."
Response:  We know that there are 41 days in a month and 86 days in a season. So, if we want to calculate how many days it takes for one parippakva sundala (unripe) to become ripe, we need to divide the number of days in a season by 41. Therefore, the answer is: 86/41 = 2.07 days per day.
"Response:  We know that there are 71 borewells in the area and each borewell requires 60 cubic meters of water per day. So, the total amount of water required from all the borewells is:

71 borewells x 60 cubic meters/day = 4260 cubic meters/day

Now, we need to calculate how much water can be saved if 35 borewells are closed for 15 days. To do this, we will use the formula:

Total water saved = Total daily water requirement x Number of days closed

So, in this case, the total water saved would be:

Total water saved = 4260 cubic meters/day x 15 days = 6390 cubic meters

Therefore, if 35 borewells are closed for 15 days, the total water saved would be 6390 cubic meters."
Response:  We know that Jesika is 12 feet tall and her head is 11 feet high from the ground. So, we need to find out how many feet long is her head relative to her body height.  Since Jesika's head is 11 feet high from the ground, it means that her head is 11/12 of her total height (12 feet) away from the ground. Therefore, the length of Jesika's head relative to her body height is 11/12 \* 12 = 9.5 feet.
Response:  Jessica is 7 feet tall and wants to buy a carpet that measures 14 feet long. To find out how much carpet she can buy with her height, we need to divide her height by the length of the carpet. So, if Jessica's height is 7 feet (which is equal to 8.25 inches), and the carpet is 14 feet long (which is equal to 16.33 feet), then we can calculate the number of times Jessica's height fits into the length of the carpet as follows: Height = 8.25 inches Length of carpet = 16.33 feet Number of times Jessica's height fits into the length of the carpet = Height / Length of carpet = 8.25 in x 16.33 ft = 130.97 times Therefore, Jessica can buy approximately 130.97 feet of carpet with her height of 7 feet.
Response:  Jessica is 7 feet tall and wants to buy a carpet that measures 14 feet long. So, we need to calculate how many square feet of carpet she can afford based on her height. To do this, we divide her height (in feet) by the length of the carpet (in feet).  Therefore, the number of square feet of carpet Jessica can afford is:  Height of Jessica = 7 feet Length of carpet = 14 feet Number of square feet of carpet = Height / Length = 7 / 14 = 0.50 square feet So, Jessica can afford approximately 0.50 square feet of carpet.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many feet are there in total between Jesika and Rohan. We know that Jesika is 5 feet 6 inches tall (11 फिट) and Rohan is 5 feet 9 inches tall (15 फिट). So, the total height difference between them is: 5 feet 9 inches - 5 feet 6 inches = 3 inches. Now, we need to convert this height difference into feet. There are 12 inches in one foot, so: 3 inches x 12 = 36 inches. Therefore, the total height difference between Jesika and Rohan in feet is: 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.
Response:  We have two trays of different sizes - one is 2 feet long and 12 inches wide (which is equal to 3 feet), and another is 4 feet long and 6 inches wide. To find out how many tiles can fit in each tray, we need to calculate their volumes first. The volume of the smaller tray is 2 x 3 = 6 cubic feet, and the volume of the larger tray is 4 x 6 = 24 cubic feet. Now, let's divide the total volume of both trays by the volume of each tray to get the number of tiles that can fit in each tray: Number of tiles per tray = Total volume of trays / Volume of each tray = 6 + 24 = 30 cubic feet / 6 = 5 tiles per tray So, there are 5 tiles that can fit in each of the two trays.
Response:  If Jessica has 19 feet and 18 feet of cloth, then she has a total of 37 feet of cloth (19 + 18 = 37). Now, if she wants to make a skirt that is 20 feet long, how much cloth will she have left after making the skirt? To find out, we need to subtract the length of the skirt from the total amount of cloth she has. So, 20 - 37 = -17 feet. Therefore, Jessica will have -17 feet of cloth left after making the skirt.
"Response:  The height of Jessica is 19 feet and her weight is 20 feet. So, we need to find out how many times Jessica's height is equal to her weight. We can do this by dividing Jessica's weight by her height:  Jessica's weight (in feet) = 20 feet; Height of Jessica (in feet) = 19 feet  Now, let's divide Jessica's weight by her height:  Number of times Jessica's height is equal to her weight = 20 feet / 19 feet = 1.0588235294117647  Therefore, Jessica is approximately 1.0588235294117647 times taller than her weight."
Response:  If Jessica wants to know how many carpets of size 10 feet x 12 feet (36 square feet) she can buy with $1000, we need to calculate the cost per square foot first.  The cost per square foot = Total amount / Area of the carpet = $1000 / 36 sq ft = $27.78 per sq ft Now, let's find out how many carpets of size 5 feet x 7 feet (35 square feet) she can buy with $27.78 per sq ft. Number of carpets = Total amount / Cost per sq ft = $27.78 / $27.78 = 1 carpet So, Jessica can buy one carpet of size 5 feet x 7 feet with $1000.
"Response:  If Jessica wants to know how many times her 10-foot long carpet will fit in her 2-foot wide room, we need to divide the length of the carpet (10 feet) by the width of the room (2 feet). So, the number of times the carpet can fit in the room is:

$$ \divide = {10 ft} / {2 ft} = 5 $$

Therefore, Jessica's carpet can fit in her room 5 times."
Response:  We know that Jessica is 6 feet tall and her shoes are 4 inches long. So, if we calculate the total length of her footwear, it will be: Total length = (6 x 2) + (4 x 1) = 12 + 4 = 16 inches. Therefore, Jessica needs 16 inches of carpet for each foot.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of T-shirts that each person can sell in one day.  For Arkansas, there are approximately 230 people who can buy T-shirts per day.  Similarly, for Texas, there are around 230 people who can buy T-shirts per day.  Therefore, the total number of T-shirts that can be sold in one day is:  Arkansas - 230 x 23 = 5170 T-shirts Texas - 230 x 23 = 5170 T-shirts So, the total number of T-shirts that can be sold in one day is 5170 T-shirts.
Response:  We have to sell 3 T-shirts at $51 each in Arkansas and Texas. So, we will make $51 x 3 = $153 from selling those 3 T-shirts.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Rajan and his friends sold 87 T-shirts in total at an average price of $12 each. So, their total revenue was:

87 x $12 = $1042

Now, let's calculate how much money they would have made if they had sold 47 T-shirts instead of 87. We can do this by multiplying the number of T-shirts sold by the average price per T-shirt:

47 x $12 = $564

So, if Rajan and his friends had sold 47 T-shirts instead of 87, they would have made $564 less than what they actually made."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Rajan and Arjun sold 106 t-shirts each during their respective games. So, in total, they sold 212 t-shirts. Now, let's calculate how many t-shirts each of them sold during their respective games:
Rajan sold 106 t-shirts during his game, which lasted for 3 hours. Therefore, he sold 35.33 t-shirts per hour (106/3).
Arjun sold 106 t-shirts during his game, which lasted for 4 hours. Therefore, he sold 26.5 t-shirts per hour (106/4).
Now, if Arjun had played for 115 minutes more than Rajan, then Arjun's total playing time would be:
Arjun's playing time = Rajan's playing time + (115 minutes / 60)
= 3 hours + (115/60)
= 3.5 hours
So, Arjun sold 28.75 t-shirts per hour (26.5 t-shirts per hour x 3.5 hours).
Therefore, the difference between the number of t-shirts sold by Rajan and Arjun is:
Difference = Arjun's sales - Rajan's sales
= 28.75 - 35.33
= -6.58
So, Arjun sold fewer t-shirts than Rajan during their respective games."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rajan and his friends sold 98 T-shirts in total during their Arkansas trip. Out of these, they sold 89 T-shirts during the time they played cricket, which is equivalent to २०% of the total sales. Therefore, if they had played cricket for ७४ hours instead of ५४ hours, they would have sold an additional २०% of the total sales, which is equal to २०% x ७४ hours = १४ hours. So, the additional time spent playing cricket resulted in an increase of १४ hours in the sale of T-shirts. Now, let's calculate the revenue generated from each hour of cricket played. We know that they sold ८९ T-shirts during the cricket match, which means they earned ९८ dollars per T-shirt. Therefore, the total revenue generated from the cricket match is equal to ९८ dollars x ८९ T-shirts = ७७७ dollars. Finally, we can calculate the average price paid per T-shirt by dividing the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold, which gives us ७७७ dollars / ८९ T-shirts = ८५ dollars per T-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many T-shirts each person in Arkansas and Texas sold during their respective games.  For Arkansas, there were 78 T-shirt sales, and for Texas, there were 186 T-shirt sales.  Therefore, the total number of T-shirts sold during both games is 78 + 186 = 264 T-shirts.  Now, let's assume that each T-shirt was sold at $7.80.  So, the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during both games is 264 T-shirts x $7.80 per T-shirt = $2,039.20.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many T-shirts and jeans each person in Arkansas and Texas bought during that time period. According to the given information, there were 183 T-shirt buyers and 31 jean buyers in Arkansas, while in Texas, there were 275 T-shirt buyers and 99 jean buyers. So, the total number of T-shirts sold in both states is: 183 + 275 = 458 T-shirts. Similarly, the total number of jeans sold in both states is: 31 + 99 = 130 jeans. Now, let's find out how much money each person spent on average buying T-shirts and jeans. To do this, we will divide the total amount of money spent on T-shirts and jeans by the total number of people who bought them. For T-shirts, the total amount spent is $62 x 458 = $28,056, and for jeans, it is $99 x 130 = $12,710. Therefore, the average amount spent per person on T-shirts is $28,056 / 458 = $61.37, and for jeans, it is $12,710 / 31 = $404.65.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many T-shirts and jeans each person in Arkansas and Texas can buy with their monthly income.  The average monthly salary of an adult in Arkansas is $670, and in Texas it is $165. So, if someone earns $670 per month, they could buy 74 T-shirts or 156 jeans. Similarly, if someone earns $165 per month, they could buy 23 T-shirts or 49 jeans. Therefore, the total number of T-shirts and jeans that people in Arkansas and Texas can buy depends on their individual income levels.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rajan and Arjun sold 157 T-shirts and 19 jeans respectively in Arkansas. Now, let's calculate the average price of each item they sold. The average price of each T-shirt is $24 and the average price of each jeans is $34. So, if we multiply the number of T-shirts sold by their average price, we get $3680 (157 x $24). Similarly, if we multiply the number of jeans sold by their average price, we get $666 ($19 x $34). Therefore, the total amount of money earned by Rajan and Arjun is $3680 + $666 = $4346.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each T-shirt and Jersey sold in Arkansas and Texas respectively.  The cost of one T-shirt is $86 and that of one Jersey is $232. Therefore, the total cost of 254 T-shirts and 43 Jerseys sold in Arkansas would be:  Total Cost = Number of items x Cost per item = 254 T-shirts x $86 = $21,900  Similarly, the total cost of 232 Jerseys sold in Texas would be:  Total Cost = Number of items x Cost per item = 232 Jerseys x $232 = $52,704 Now, let's find out how much the price of one T-shirt increased compared to the previous year.  To do this, we will subtract the total cost of 254 T-shirts sold last year from the total cost of 254 T-shirts sold this year:  Increase in Price = (Current Year Cost - Last Year Cost) / Last Year Cost = ($21,900 - $17,300) / $17,300 = 27% So, the price of one T-shirt has increased by 27%.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each T-shirt costs $51. Since there are 30 T-shirts in total, the cost of all T-shirts is:

$51 x 30 = $1530

Now, we know that Arkansas and Texas teams sold 8 T-shirts each. So, the total number of T-shirts sold is:

8 + 8 = 16

Therefore, the amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is:

$1530 x 16 = $24960

So, the Arkansas and Texas teams earned $24960 from selling T-shirts."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each t-shirt costs $20 and there are 20 t-shirts in total. So, the total cost of all t-shirts is:

$ 20 x 20 = $400

Now, let's see how much money each t-shirt sells for. We know that Arkansas and Texas both sold their t-shirts at $217 each. So, the total revenue generated from selling these t-shirts is:

$217 x 14 = $2958

Now, let's calculate the profit made per t-shirt:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $2958 - $400
= $2558

So, each t-shirt makes a profit of $2558."
"Response:  We have to find out how many T-shirts can be sold at $10 each to make $60 in total.  To do this, we need to divide the total amount of money ($60) by the selling price per T-shirt ($10). So, the number of T-shirts that can be sold is:

$60 / $10 = 6

So, 6 T-shirts can be sold to make $60 in total."
Response:  We know that Armani and Texaas are selling t-shirts at $215 each. If we buy 5 t-shirts, then the total cost will be $215 x 5 = $1075. So, the price of one t-shirt is $215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Raj has sold 5 t-shirts and 215 jeans in total. So, he earned $5 x 5 = $25 from selling t-shirts and $215 x 215 = $46,750 from selling jeans. Therefore, Raj earned a total of $25 + $46,750 = $46,775 from both t-shirts and jeans combined.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money each t-shirt and jeans cost. According to the given information, one t-shirt costs $204 and one jeans costs $76. So, in total, 158 t-shirts and 2 jeans would cost: 158 x $204 = $31,992  And 2 x $76 = $152. Therefore, the total amount of money made from selling these clothes is: $31,992 + $152 = $32,144.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each T-shirt and Jersey.  The cost of one T-shirt is $210 and that of one Jersey is $230. Therefore, the total cost of 177 T-shirts would be:

$210 x 177 = $36,970

Similarly, the total cost of 23 Jerseys would be:

$230 x 23 = $5,190

Now, let's find out how much Arkansas and Texas made from selling these clothes. We know that they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 Jerseys in total. So, their total revenue can be calculated as follows:

Total Revenue = Number of items sold x Price per item
= 177 T-shirts x $36,970
+ 23 Jerseys x $5,190
= $62,160 + $124,820
= $186,980

Therefore, Arkansas and Texas made a total of $186,980 from selling these clothes."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each T-shirt and Jersey.  The cost of one T-shirt is $15 and that of one Jersey is $25. Therefore, the total cost of 113 T-shirts would be $1695 ($15 x 113) and that of 78 Jerseys would be $1900 ($25 x 78). Now, let's find out how much Arkansas and Texas made from selling these clothes. According to the question, they sold 113 T-shirts for $1695 and 78 Jerseys for $1900. So, their total revenue from selling these clothes is $3695 ($1695 + $1900). Finally, we can see that the price of one T-shirt increased by $4 ($15 - $11 = $4) and that of one Jersey increased by $10 ($25 - $15 = $10).
"Response:  If there are 5 sets of 10 cups each and they want to distribute them equally among 20 people, then each person will get:

Number of cups per person = Total number of cups / Number of people
= 5 x 10 = 50 / 20
= 2.5 cups per person

So, if there are 5 sets of 10 cups each and they want to distribute them equally among 20 people, then each person will get approximately 2.5 cups."
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are needed for each set of tables and then sum them up to get the total number of cups required.  For example, if we have 12 sets of tables, each set requires 4 cups of water, so the total number of cups needed is 12 x 4 = 48 cups.
Response:  We have to find out how many sets of three cups each are needed for a total of 9 cups.  So, we divide 9 by 3: 9 / 3 = 3. Therefore, there will be 3 sets of three cups each.
Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then how many chairs will there be in total?  So, the answer is: 11 x 13 = 143 chairs.
Response:  We have 10 sets of tables with 6 plates in each set. So, the total number of plates is 10 x 6 = 60 plates. Now, if there are 11 people attending the party and they want to eat from all the sets of tables, then each person will get 6/11 = 53% of a plate. Therefore, the total number of plates that will be left for each person is (60 - 53%) = 7 plates per person.
Response:  We have 12 tables and each table has 14 cups. So, in total, we have 12 x 14 = 168 cups. But there are 7 more additional cups, so the total number of cups is 168 + 7 = 175 cups.
Response:  There are 14 people in total attending the party. Each set of three tables has 3 cups each, so there will be 3 x 3 = 9 cups in one set of tables. Since there are 14 people attending the party, and each person gets to take 3 cups from each set of tables, then the total number of cups that each person will get is 9 / 14 = 0.64 per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 0.64 cups of tea at the party.
"Response:  If there are 14 tables with 9 sets of curry per table, then the total number of curries is:

14 tables x 9 sets/table = 126 sets of curry

So, each person will get approximately 126/9 = 14 cups of curry."
"Response:  If Luis makes $5 per hour working in his field for 8 hours a day, he earns:

$5/hour x 8 hours/day = $40/day

Now, let's calculate how much money Luis makes in a week:

$40/day x 7 days/week = $280/week

So, Luis makes $280 per week working in his field."
"Response:  If Luis makes $1216 in total during his lifetime, and he spends $16 per month, then:

Total amount spent = Monthly spend x Number of months = $16 x 12 = $192

So, the remaining amount after spending $192 is:

Remaining amount = Total amount - Amount spent = $1216 - $192 = $1024

Therefore, if Luis spends $16 per month, he will have $1024 left after 12 months."
"Response:  If Louis can make $216 per hour working in his field, and he works for 702 hours in a year (which is equivalent to 30 days x 24 hours/day), then his total earnings from his job would be:

Total earnings = Hourly wage x Number of hours worked
= $216/hour x 702 hours
= $150,984 per year ($216/hour x 702 hours)
So, if Louis makes $150,984 per year from his job, and he spends $70,200 on fruits, then he has $80,784 left after buying fruits."
"Response:  If Luis can make $1357 in 8 hours working at $16 per hour, then he can make:

$1357 x 8 = $10,248 in one day (24 hours)

Now, let's calculate how much money Luis can make in a month (30 days):

$10,248 x 30 = $307,400

So, if Luis works for 8 hours a day and makes $10,248 per day, he can make approximately $307,400 per month."
Response:  If Louis made $28 per hour working for 40 hours in a week, his total earnings would be:  $28 x 40 = $1120 per week. Now, if he worked an additional 93 days at the same rate, his total earnings would be: $1120 x 93 = $105600. So, if he worked every day without taking any breaks or vacations, he could potentially make around $105600 in one year.
Response:  If Louis can make $403 per day working 8 hours a day, then he can make $1612 per day working 24 hours a day (8 hours x 3). So, if he works for 30 days straight without taking any breaks, he will have earned $ $49,320 ($1612 x 30).
"Response:  If Louis can make $368 per day working 8 hours a day, then he will make $2880 per week if he works 7 days a week. Now, let's calculate how much money he will have after 1 year (52 weeks).

If he makes $2880 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, then he will have made a total of $149,600 ($2880 x 52) in a year. So, his savings at the end of 1 year will be $149,600 - $36,800 = $112,800."
Response:  If he can make $491 per day working 8 hours a day, then in 1181 days (3 years and 4 months), he will have earned $567,230 ($491 x 1181). However, if he spends $216 per month on fruits and vegetables, then after 1181 days, he will have spent a total of $259,630 ($216 x 1181). So, his net profit will be $307,600 ($567,230 - $259,630).
Response:  We have to grow wheat in 19 hectares of land and sell it for $133 per dollar. So, we will get total revenue of $2507 ($133 x 19 hectares). Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit = Revenue - Cost. Cost = Production cost + Other expenses. Let's assume production cost is $60 per hectare and other expenses are $20 per hectare. Total cost = $60 x 19 hectares + $20 x 19 hectares = $1140 + $380 = $1520. Therefore, our profit would be $2507 - $1520 = $987.
Response:  If he makes $2 per hour and works for 8 hours a day, his daily income is $16 ($2 x 8).  Now, if he works for 7 days a week, his total weekly income is $112 ($16 x 7).  Finally, if he works for 50 weeks in a year (assuming 4 weeks of vacation), his annual income is $5600 ($112 x 50).
"Response:  If Vishram takes 10 minutes to fill up water in his container and he has 9 feet of height, then the volume of water he can pour is equal to 9/12 of the total capacity of the container. So, if the container has a capacity of 100 liters (which is equivalent to 35.3 gallons), then the volume of water that Vishram can pour is:

Volume of water = Total capacity of container / Number of feet of height
= 100 liters / 9 feet
= 11.11 liters per minute

So, Vishram can pour approximately 11.11 liters of water per minute."
Response:  We know that water weighs approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). So, if we have a cube of water with a volume of 2 cubic meters (m3), its weight would be: Water weight = Volume x Density = 2 m3 x 1 g/cm3 = 2000 kg Now, let's calculate the weight of dinosaur feces based on the given information: Dinosaur feces weight = Amount of feces x Density of feces = 8 ft3 x 2 g/ft3 = 16 kg Therefore, if there are 14 feet of dinosaur feces, their total weight would be: Total weight of dinosaur feces = Number of feet x Weight per foot = 14 ft x 16 kg/ft = 224 kg
Response:  We know that water weighs approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). So, if we have 500 grams of water in a container, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = Mass / Density = 500 g / 1 g/cm3 = 500 cm3 Now, let's assume that the density of dinosaur dung is roughly half that of water, i.e., 0.5 g/cm3. Therefore, if we have 1200 grams of dinosaur dung, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = Mass / Density = 1200 g / 0.5 g/cm3 = 2400 cm3 If we compare these two volumes, we see that the volume of dinosaur dung is significantly larger than that of water. In fact, it is almost twice as large! So, if we had to guess how many liters of water could fit inside a pile of dinosaur dung, we would say around 2 liters at least.
Response:  We know that Vishram has taken 15 kg of rice and given 4 kg of wheat in exchange for it. So, he now has 11 kg of rice left (15 - 4 = 11). Now, we are told that if Rohan had taken 13 kg of rice instead of 4 kg, then Pani would have received 9 kg of rice (13 - 4 = 9) from him. Therefore, the amount of rice that Pani received from both Vishram and Rohan is equal to 11 + 9 = 20 kg of rice.
Response:  We know that water weighs approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). So, if there are 16 grams of water in a liter (L), then there will be 16 x 1000 = 1600 grams of water in a cubic meter (m³). Now, let's calculate how much water is required to fill up a container with a volume of 9 feet (ft) x 3 ft = 27 cubic feet (ft³). To do this, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to liters. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and there are 12 inches in 1 square foot. Therefore, there are 12 x 12 = 144 inches in 1 cubic foot. So, 27 cubic feet is equal to 27 x 144 = 3856 cubic inches. Now, since there are 1600 g/cm³ of water, we can calculate the weight of water required to fill the container as follows: weight of water = volume of water x density of water = 3856 cm³ x 1600 g/cm³ = 614,480 grams or approximately 614 kg. Therefore, if it takes 13 feet (ft) to fill the container, then the weight of water required to fill it would be 614 kg / 13 ft = approximately 47,692 grams or 47.7 kilograms.
Response:  We know that Vishram has taken a decision to play cricket with his friends after drinking 9 cups of water. Now, we need to calculate how much weight he will lose if he plays for 15 minutes and then drinks 6 cups of water again.  Firstly, let's calculate the amount of water he drank initially. Since he drank 9 cups of water, the total volume of water he drunk is: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 9 cups x 200 ml/cup = 1800 ml  Next, let's calculate the weight loss due to dehydration based on the formula provided in the question: Weight loss (in grams) = Total volume of water lost x 0.5%  So, the weight loss due to dehydration would be: Weight loss = 1800 ml x 0.5% = 9 grams  Finally, let's calculate the new weight of Vishram after playing cricket for 15 minutes and drinking 6 cups of water again: New weight = Old weight - Weight loss = 70 kg - 9 g = 69.91 kg  Therefore, Vishram will lose approximately 9 grams of weight after playing cricket for 15 minutes and drinking 6 cups of water again.
Response:  If Brain has 34 books and he wants to distribute them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of books, then we need to divide 34 by the number of friends he has.  Since Brain has 20 friends, we can give him 1.7 books per friend (34/20). So, Brain will have 56 books left after distributing them equally among his 20 friends (34 - 1.7 x 20 = 56).
"Response:  Brainly has total 42 books in its library and each book contains 2 shelves. So, the total number of shelves Brainly has is:

Total no. of books = 42
No. of shelves per book = 2
Total no. of shelves = Total no. of books x No. of shelves per book
= 42 x 2
= 84 shelves
Therefore, Brainly has 84 shelves in its library."
Response:  Brainly has 27 books and 80 articles. Each book contains an average of 30 pages, so there are 23 books with 690 pages in total (27 x 30 = 810). Therefore, the total number of pages in all Brainly publications is 810 + 690 = 1500 pages.
Response:  Brainly has 10 books and each book contains 9 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in Brainly is: 10 x 9 = 90 pages. Now, let's consider the magazine. If it contains 46 pages, then the total number of pages in the magazine is: 46 + 90 = 136 pages. So, the total number of pages in Brainly and the magazine together is: 136 pages.
Response:  Brainly has 23 books and 61 articles. If we multiply these numbers together, we get 29 x 61 = 1791. So, the total number of pages in Brainly's books and articles is 1791 pages.
Response:  Brainly has 7 books in total, and each book has an equal number of pages as the number of questions answered on Brainly. So, if Brainly has answered 28 questions, then each book has 28/7 = 4 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in all 7 books is 7 x 4 = 28 pages.
"Response:  Brainly has 20 books in total. If he gives each book a price of Rs. 38, then the total cost of all the books is:

Total cost = Number of books x Price per book
= 20 books x Rs. 38
= Rs. 760
So, the total amount that Brainly will pay for all the 38 books is Rs. 760."
Response:  If there are 10 people celebrating their birthdays today and each person has to bring 2 presents for their friends, then how many gifts will they have in total?  So, the total number of gifts = 10 x 2 = 20 gifts.
Response:  We have to find out how many people are there in total and then divide it by 12 to get the average number of birthday cards per person. So, let's first calculate the total number of people: 12 x 3 = 36 people have given birthday cards. Now, we need to divide the total number of people by 12 to get the average number of birthday cards per person: 36 / 12 = 3 average birthday cards per person. Therefore, each person has approximately 3 birthday cards.
Response:  If there are 10 friends and each friend has to give a speech for 5 minutes, then the total time required for all the speeches will be 5 x 10 = 50 minutes. Now, if we subtract the time taken by the first two speakers (7 + 3 = 10 minutes), then the remaining time available for the other 8 speakers will be 50 - 10 = 40 minutes. So, each of the next 8 speakers will have 40/8 = 5 minutes to deliver their speeches.
Response:  If there are 14 people in total and each person has to give a speech for 5 minutes, then the total time required for all the speeches will be 70 minutes (14 x 5 = 70). Now, if we subtract the time taken by the first speaker (6 minutes), then the remaining time available for the other speakers will be 64 minutes (70 - 6 = 64). So, each of the next 13 speakers will get approximately 5 minutes and 2 seconds (64 / 13 = 5 + 2) to deliver their speeches.
Response:  If there are 9 friends and each friend has to give 3 recommendations for their favorite movies, then the total number of movie recommendations will be 9 x 3 = 27.  But if they have to give 2 recommendations each, then the total number of movie recommendations will be 9 x 2 = 18.
Response:  If Melisa can get 12 points in each game, and she has played 36 games altogether, then the total number of points she has scored is:  Total score = Number of games x Points per game = 36 x 12 = 432 points.
Response:  We have to find out how many points each game will score and then add them up.  For Game 1, we know that Melissa scored 25 points and lost by 7 points, so she scored 32 - 7 = 25 points.  For Game 2, we know that Melissa won by 9 points, so she scored 9 points.  For Game 3, we know that Melissa lost by 4 points, so she scored 8 - 4 = 4 points.  Therefore, the total number of points Melissa scored is 25 + 9 + 4 = 48 points.
Response:  We know that Melisa has scored 109 points in each of the first 82 games and 79 points in the last game. So, we can calculate her average score as follows:  Average Score = (Total Points / Number of Games) Total Points = 109 x 82 + 79 = 8653 Number of Games = 83 Therefore, Melisa's average score is 8653/83 = 104.5 points per game.
Response:  Melisa has collected 21 coins in total and she wants to distribute them equally among her friends so that each friend gets an equal number of coins. Since there are 7 friends, each friend will get 3 coins (21 / 7 = 3). So, Melisa distributed 3 coins to each of her 7 friends.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Melissa has thrown in total and then divide it equally among the nine players. So, we can start with finding out the total number of balls that Melissa threw. According to the question, she threw 13 balls. Now, let's assume each player gets an equal share of the total number of balls thrown by Melissa. Therefore, the number of balls each player will get is: Total number of balls = Number of balls thrown by Melissa x Players = 13 x 9 = 117 balls.
Response:  If we have 40 people in a park and each person can walk at most 2 km/hr, then the total distance they can cover in one hour is: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 km/hr x 60 min/hour = 120 km. So, if 20 people start walking simultaneously, they can cover a distance of 120 km in one hour.
"Response:  If there are 18 people in one room and each person can eat 9 meals at a time, then the total number of meals that can be eaten in that room is:

18 people x 9 meals/person = 162 meals

So, if all 18 people start eating at the same time (i.e., 18 people x 1 meal/person = 18 meals), then the total number of meals that can be eaten in that room at any given time is:

162 meals - 18 meals = 144 meals

Therefore, Ferries Wheeler can eat 144 meals at once."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 seats in each ferry and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, to find out how many trips the ferry can make in one hour, we need to divide the total number of seats by the number of people it can accommodate per trip. Therefore, the number of trips the ferry can make in one hour is:

$$ \frac {19 \times 15} {20} = 96 $$

So, the ferry can make $96$ trips in one hour."
"Response:  We have to find out how many people can fit in each seat and then calculate the total number of people who can be accommodated in all 18 seats.  If we assume that each seat can accommodate 15 people, then we can calculate the total number of people who can be accommodated as follows:

Number of people who can be accommodated = Total number of seats x Number of people per seat
= 18 x 15
= 270 people

So, if 10 seats are available at any given time, then the maximum number of people who can be accommodated is:

Maximum number of people who can be accommodated = Available seats x Number of people per seat
= 10 x 15
= 150 people"
Response:  We have to find out how many people can fit in one park and then calculate how many parks are needed for 60 people.  The size of each park is given as 14 janas (which means 14 x 3 = 42 square meters). So, if we divide the total area required by the number of people who can fit in one park, we get: Total Area Required / Number of People per Park = 60 / 14 = 4.29 parks. Since you cannot have a fraction of a park, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 5 parks. Therefore, 5 parks would be able to accommodate 60 people.
Response:  We have to find out how many jana (people) can fit in one sita (site). According to the given information, one sita is equal to 23 vatas (units of measurement), and each vata contains 14 janas (people). So, we can calculate the number of people who can fit in one sita as follows: Number of people = Total area of one sita / Area per vata x Number of vatas in one sita Therefore, the total area of one sita is 2 vats x 23 vats = 46 vats. Now, we know that each vata contains 14 janas, so the number of people who can fit in one sita is: Number of people = 46 vats / 14 vatas per sita = 3.25 janas per sita Since there are 23 vats in one sita, we can calculate the total number of people who can fit in one sita as follows: Total number of people = Number of janas per sita x Number of vats in one sita Therefore, the total number of people who can fit in one sita is: Total number of people = 3.25 janas/sita x 23 vats/sita = 74.75 janas or approximately 75 people.
"Response:  We have to find out how many jana (people) can fit in each seat and then calculate how many seats are available for ferries.  From the given information, we know that there are 3 swarg parkamas (heavens) with 16 janas (people) in each heaven.  So, the total number of people who can fit in these heavens is:

3 swarg parkamas x 16 janas per parkama = 48 janas

Now, let's come to the ferries. There are 7 thulasi parks (fields) with 12 janas in each field. Therefore, the total number of people who can fit in these fields is:

7 thulasi parks x 12 janas per park = 84 janas

So, the total number of people who can fit in both the heavens and fields is:

48 janas + 84 janas = 132 janas

Now, we need to find out how many seats are available for ferries. As mentioned earlier, each ferry has 7 vats (seats). Therefore, the total number of seats available for ferries is:

7 vats x 7 thulasi parks = 49 seats

Finally, we can see how many seats are left after accommodating all the people who want to go to Swarga. The remaining seats are:

Available seats = Total seats - Number of people who can fit in both heavens and fields
= 49 seats - 132 janas
= -83 seats

Therefore, there are -83 seats available for ferries to take people to Swarga."
"Response:  If there are 16 people in total and each person can sit in 4 seats, then the total number of seats available for all 16 people is:

16 people x 4 seats per person = 64 seats
So, each person can have 4 seats."
Response:  If there are four people in one room and each person can sit on two chairs, then how many chairs will be available for all four people to sit on simultaneously?  We have: Number of people = 4 People per room = 2 Chairs per person = 8 total chairs So, there will be 8 chairs available for all four people to sit on simultaneously.
Response:  We have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices. So, in total we have 7 x 8 = 56 slices of pizza. Now, if there are 14 people to share these slices equally among them, then each person will get 56 / 14 = 4 slices of pizza.
Response:  We have 28 slimes and each slime has 2 tukras. So, in total we have 28 x 2 = 56 tukras of slime.
"Response:  We have 17 people in total and each person has 4 slides. So, the total number of slides is:

17 x 4 = 68 slides

Therefore, there are 68 slides in total."
Response:  We have 9 vats of rice and each vat contains 10 tukras. So, in total, we have 9 x 10 = 90 tukras of rice. If we divide this amount equally among two people, then each person will get 90/2 = 45 tukras of rice.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bags of flowers can be filled with 45 cups of water.  First, we need to convert the volume of water from cups to liters. There are 100 milliliters in one liter, so:

45 cups x 237 ml/cup = 10,675 ml

Now, we know that each bag of flowers can hold approximately 10 liters of water. So, to find out how many bags of flowers can be filled with 10,675 ml of water, we divide the total volume of water by the capacity of each bag:

10,675 ml / 10 l/bag = 106.75 bags

Therefore, if there are 45 cups of water and each bag can hold approximately 10 liters of water, then there will be 106.75 bags of flowers."
Response:  We have 9 flowers in total and each flower has 45 petals. So, the total number of petals for all 9 flowers is 45 x 9 = 365 petals. Now, we are asked how many bags of 45 petals each can be made from these 365 petals. To find out, we divide 365 petals by 45 petals per bag, which gives us 8 bags. Therefore, 8 bags of 45 petals each can be made from the 9 flowers.
"Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are in each pot and then multiply it with the number of pots. So, let's calculate first:

Number of flowers in one pot = 36 flowers / 12 vats = 3 flowers per vat

Now, we need to find out how many vats there are in total. According to the question, there are 36 vats in total.

So, the total number of flowers = Number of vats x Number of flowers in one vat
= 36 vats x 3 flowers/vat
= 108 flowers

Therefore, there are 108 flowers in total."
Response:  We have to distribute 55 flowers among 30 people in such a way that each person gets at least 15 flowers and no one gets more than 60 flowers.  So, we need to divide 55 flowers into groups of 30 people with a maximum of 60 flowers per group.  Therefore, the number of groups is 55 / 60 = 9.
Response:  If each flower requires 10 seeds to grow and there are 60 flowers in total, then the number of seeds required for all the flowers is: 60 x 10 = 600 seeds.
Response:  We have 8 flowers in total and each flower has 3 petals. So, we have 8 x 3 = 24 petals altogether. Now, if each person can collect 32 petals, then each person will be able to collect (24 / 32) = 0.75 bunches of flowers. Therefore, each person can collect approximately 0.75 bunches of flowers.
"Response:  If Myanmar has 55 million people and each person gives $2 to their 11 friends, then the total amount of money given is:

$2 x 55 million = $110 million

So, Myanmar gave $110 million in aid to its 11 friends."
Response:  If Maithili can make 7 dishes for her friends in one day, and each friend gets 2 portions of food, then how many portions will she give to each friend?  Therefore, Maithili will give 14 portions (7 x 2) to each of her friends.
Response:  If Myathyule has 15 friends and each friend eats 5 packets of food, then Myathyule will eat 5 x 15 = 75 packets of food. Since there are 10 bags of rice available, each bag can provide 50 packets of food (since each packet contains 250 grams). Therefore, 75 packets / 50 packets per bag = 1.5 bags of rice. So, Myathyule will need 1.5 bags of rice to feed all his friends.
Response:  If Myathyule can hit 24 wickets in 3 overs, then he will have to bowl at an average of 8 wickets per over (24/3 = 8). Now, if he has 3 teammates and each of them takes turns bowling, then they will be able to take 17 wickets (17 x 3 = 51) in total. So, the remaining 9 wickets will be taken by Myathyule himself (51 - 17 = 34). Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  If Myathyule has packed 22 packets of snacks and each packet contains 34 pieces, then total number of snacks = 22 x 34 = 716. Now, if there are 11 people sharing equally among them, then each person will get = 716 / 11 = 65 snacks.
Response:  If Myathyule has packed 29 packets of snacks and distributed them equally among his two friends, then each friend will get 14.5 packets (29/2 = 14.5). Now, if each packet contains 30 watts of energy, then the total amount of energy that each friend will consume is 14.5 x 30 = 435 watt-hours (Wh).
"Response:  If Myathyule has 14 packets of food and can feed 7 people equally, then each person will get:

$$ \frac{14}{7} = 2 $$ packets of food per person.

So, each person will eat $2$ packets of food."
Response:  If there are 18 people in total and each person has to eat 36 packets of food, then:  Number of packets of food that each person can have = Total number of packets of food / Number of people  Number of packets of food per person = 36 packets / 18 people = 2 packets per person Therefore, each person will be able to eat 2 packets of food.
Response:  If there are 6 people in total and each person has to share equally among themselves, then the number of shares will be 6/1 = 6. So, each person will get 6 shares or 6/6 = 1 share. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  There are 23 people in total and they have to share their food equally among themselves. Since there are only 11 plates available, each person will get 2 plates (11/23). So, each person will eat 2 plates of food.
Response:  Myathyo has 31 friends and he wants to distribute 5 bags of rice among them equally. So, each friend will get 1/5 of one bag of rice = 20% of one bag of rice. Since there are 31 friends, Myathyo has 31 x 20% = 6.3 bags of rice left over after distributing 5 bags equally among his friends.
Response:  If there are 32 packets of chocolate and each packet contains 98 pieces of chocolate, then the total number of pieces of chocolate in all the packets is: 32 packets x 98 pieces/packet = 3160 pieces of chocolate. Now, if each person gets to eat 5 pieces of chocolate, then the total number of pieces of chocolate that each person will get to eat is: 3160 pieces / 5 pieces/person = 632 people.
"Response:  If there are 10 packets of snacks ( each containing 8 vatas) and 5 people want to share them equally among themselves, then each person will get:

Number of vatas = Total number of packets x Number of people sharing / Number of vatas in each packet
= 10 x 5 / 8
= 62.5 vatas per person
Therefore, each person will get 62.5 vatas of snacks."
Response:  There are 28 people in total and each person has to share equally among themselves. So, if there are 13 packets of food and 15 people, each person will get 1/2 = 0.57 packet of food (rounded off to one decimal place). Therefore, each person will get approximately 0.57 packets of food.
"Response:  The number of bottles that were sold in 109 days is given as 109. Now, we need to find out how many bottles are sold per day. To do this, we divide the total number of bottles sold (109) by the number of days they were sold (109). So, the number of bottles sold per day is:

$$ \frac{109}{109} = 1 $$

So, there was one bottle sold per day."
Response:  The water level in the tank is decreasing at a rate of 153 liters per day. If the tank can hold 17 days worth of water (i.e., 17 x 153 = 2591 liters), then how much water will be left in the tank after 17 days? So, the answer is 2591 - 153 = 2438 liters.
"Response:  Debbie has 264 water bottles and she fills each bottle with 15 liters of water. She sells them every day for 11 days. How many bottles will she have left after selling all the bottles?

Let's assume that she sells x bottles per day. Then, the total number of bottles she will sell is:
x = 11 days \* 15 liters/bottle = 165 liters
Since Debbie starts with 264 bottles, the number of bottles she will have left after selling all the bottles can be calculated as follows:
Number of bottles left = Total number of bottles sold - Initial number of bottles = 165 liters / 15 liters/bottle = 11 bottles
Therefore, Debbie will have 11 bottles left after selling all the bottles."
Response:  We know that Debbie has 301 water bottles and she uses 144 bottles every day for 7 days straight. So, in total, she will use 1008 bottles (301 x 7). Now, we are asked how many bottles she would have left if she had started with 157 bottles initially. Therefore, the number of bottles she will have left after using 1008 bottles is: 157 - 1008 = -851 bottles.
Response:  We have two vessels - one containing 88 liters of water and another containing 13 liters of saltwater. If they are mixed equally, how much water will be left in each vessel afterward?  Since there are 4 liters of water in each vessel initially, if we mix them equally, then after mixing, each vessel will contain 20 liters of water (i.e., 88 liters / 2 = 44 liters + 13 liters). So, the amount of water left in each vessel after mixing is 44 liters.
"Response:  Debbie has 200 bottles of water and 312 bottles of soda. If she drinks 8 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda every day, how many days will it take for her to finish all the bottles?

Answer:

Days = Total bottles / Daily consumption
= 200 + 312 - (8 x Days) - (4 x Days)
= 520 - 32 - 32
= 466 days

Therefore, it will take Debbie approximately 466 days to finish all the bottles if she continues consuming them at the same rate."
Response:  We know that Debbie has 6 bottles of water and she uses 12 liters of water per day. So, we need to calculate how many days it will take for her to finish all the water in those 6 bottles.  To do this, we can divide the total amount of water (12 liters/day x number of days) by the capacity of each bottle (1 liter).  Therefore, the answer is:  Days = Total amount of water / Capacity of each bottle = 12 liters/day x 30 days / 1 liter = 360 days
Response:  Debbie has 95 bottles of water and fills 180 bottles with water in one day. If she filled each bottle to the brim (i.e., completely full), then: Number of days it would take her to fill 180 bottles = Total number of bottles / Amount of water filled per day = 95 bottles / 180 bottles per day = 0.5273 days (or approximately 1.64 days) So, it would take Debbie approximately 1.64 days to fill all 180 bottles if she continues filling them at the same rate.
"Response:  Debbie has 360 bottles of water and fills 162 bottles with water every day. If she continues to fill bottles at this rate for 5 days, then:

Day 1: She filled 162 bottles = 162/360 x 1 = 0.447 (approximately) bottles per day
Day 2: She filled 162 bottles - 162/360 x 2 = 0.447 (approximately) bottles per day
Day 3: She filled 162 bottles - 162/360 x 3 = 0.447 (approximately) bottles per day
Day 4: She filled 162 bottles - 162/360 x 4 = 0.447 (approximately) bottles per day
Day 5: She filled 162 bottles - 162/360 x 5 = 0.447 (approximately) bottles per day

So, in total, Debbie filled approximately 2189 bottles (5 days x 0.447 bottles per day)."
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils are there in total and then divide it by 14 to get the number of pensils per pack. So, let's calculate the total number of pensils first. According to the question, there are 14 packets of pensils, and each packet contains 11 pensils. Therefore, the total number of pensils = Number of packets x Number of pensils in each packet = 14 x 11 = 154 pensils. Now, we need to divide the total number of pensils by 14 to get the number of pensils per pack. So, the number of pensils per pack = Total number of pensils / Number of packets = 154 / 14 = 11 pensils per pack.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pensils are needed to fill 12 watters of ink. Since each pencil contains 3 watters of ink, we need:

$$ \text{Number of pensils} = \frac{\text{Total amount of ink (in watters)}}{\text{Amount of ink per pencil (in watters)}} $$

Given that we want to fill $12$ watters of ink with $3$ watters of ink per pencil, we can calculate the number of pensils as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{Number of pensils} &= \frac{12}{3} \\
&= 4 \
\end{aligned} $$

Therefore, we need $4$ pensils to fill $12$ watters of ink."
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils are needed for each pencil and then multiply it with the total number of pencils.  For this, we need to divide the weight of one pencil (16 vata) by the weight of one pencil (28 vata). So, we get: Number of pensils per pencil = 16/28 = 0.5714285714... Now, let's calculate the total number of pensils needed for 28 pencils: Total number of pensils = 0.5714285714... x 28 = 15.39... Therefore, there will be approximately 15.39 pensils needed for 28 pencils.

Now, we need to divide the total number of pensils by 6 to get the number of pensils per pack: 132 / 6 = 22 pensils per pack.
Response:  If we have 35 pens and want to divide them equally among 7 people, each person will get 5 pens (35 / 7 = 5). Now, if we add the number of pens each person got (5) with the total number of pens available (35), we get the total number of pens that are left over after dividing them equally among all the people (35 - 7 x 5 = 10). Therefore, there will be 10 pens left over after dividing them equally among all the people.
Response:  We have 19 pens and we want to divide them equally among 7 people. So, each person will get 2 pens (19 / 7 = 2). Now, let's find out how many pens each of the 4 colors has. If there are 4 red pens, then there are 4 x 4 = 16 blue pens. Therefore, each color has 16 pens (total number of pens / total number of colors).So, the answer is 16.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils are there in total and then divide it by 7 to get the number of pensils per pack. So, let's calculate the total number of pensils first. From the question, we know that there are 36 pensils in each pack. Therefore, the total number of pensils = 36 x 7 = 252 pensils. Now, we need to divide the total number of pensils by 7 to get the number of pensils per pack. So, the number of pensils per pack = 252 / 7 = 36 pensils per pack.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils and pencils are there in total.  There are 11 packets of pensils, each containing 31 pensils. So, the total number of pensils is 11 x 31 = 341 pensils. Similarly, there are 27 packets of pencils, each containing 25 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is 27 x 25 = 675 pencils.  Hence, the total number of pensils and pencils together is 341 + 675 = 1016.
Response:  We have to find out how many pennies can fit in a container of 30 watermelons. To do this, we need to divide the volume of one watermelon (5 watermelons) by the volume of one penny. So, if we assume that each watermelon has a volume of 5 watermelons x 100 = 500 cubic centimeters (cm³), then we can calculate the volume of one penny as follows: Volume of one penny = Diameter of a penny x Length of a penny x Height of a penny = 0.7854 cm x 0.629 cm x 0.064 cm = 0.00492 cubic centimeters (cm³). Now, let's divide the volume of one watermelon by the volume of one penny to get an estimate of how many pensinsula can fit in a container of 30 watermelons: Number of pensinsulas that can fit in a container of 30 watermelons = Volume of one watermelon / Volume of one penny = 500 cm³ / 0.00492 cm³ = approximately 10,440,000 pensinsulas. Therefore, based on these calculations, it is estimated that around 10 million pensinsulas can fit in a container of 30 watermelons.
Response:  We have 6 pens and we want to divide them equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 1 pen. Now let's assume that there are 7 pencils in total (including the one that is already used). If we give 1 pencil to each of the 5 people, then how many pencils will be left? Therefore, the answer is 7 - 5 = 2 pencils.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils can be made from 35 watermelons and each pencil requires 4 watermelon slices. So, we need to divide 35 watermelons by 4 watermelon slices per pencil. Therefore, the number of pensils that can be made is: 35 / 4 = 875 pensils.

"Response:  We have:

* Number of schools = 21 (as given in the question)
* Total number of students = 98 (as given in the question)
* Number of classes per school = 7 (as given in the question)

Now, let's calculate the total number of classes:
Total number of classes = Number of schools x Number of classes per school
= 21 x 7
= 147 classes

So, there are 147 classes in all the schools combined."
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in total and each class has 50 students. So, the total number of students in all classes is:

84 x 50 = 4200

Now, we need to calculate the number of students who can fit in one bus. As per the information given, there are 118 buses available. Therefore, the maximum number of students who can be accommodated in one bus is:

118 x 50 = 5900

So, the total number of students in all classes is less than the number of students who can fit in one bus. The difference between these two numbers gives us the exact number of students who cannot fit in one bus:

4200 - 5900 = -1700

Therefore, there are 1700 students who cannot fit in one bus."
Response:  We have 67 classes in total and each class has 66 students. So, we have 67 x 66 = 4232 students in our school. If each bus can seat 50 passengers, then we need 4232 / 50 = 84.6 students per bus to accommodate all of them. Therefore, we will require 84 buses to transport all the students from their homes to school.
Response:  We have to calculate the total number of students in each class and then add them up to get the total number of students in the school.  The school has 87 classes with an average of 58 students per class, so there are 87 x 58 = 4960 students in the school. Since each bus can seat 20 passengers, we need 4960 / 20 = 248 buses to transport all the students to school.
"Response:  We have:

* Number of schools = 24
* Total number of students = 120
* Number of classes per school = 8

= 102 x 99
= 10180

So, 10180 students can go for trips."
Response:  We have to calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated in each classroom and then multiply it with the total number of classes to get the total capacity of the school.  Based on the information provided in the question, there are 72 classes in the school, and each class has 3 seats. Therefore, the total number of students that can be accommodated in each class is 3. Now, let's calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated in the entire school. Since there are 111 students in the school, we need to divide the total number of classes by the number of students to get the average number of students per class. So, the average number of students per class is 3/111 = 0.027 or approximately 2.7 students per class. Finally, to find out how many students can be accommodated in one bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses available. According to the question, there are 3 buses available, so the maximum number of students that can be accommodated in each bus is 2.7 x 3 = 8.1 students. Therefore, the total number of students that can be accommodated in one bus is 8.1.
Response:  We have to find out how many students are in each class and then calculate the total number of students in all classes.  There are 17 classes in the school, and each class has 46 students. Therefore, there are 782 students (17 x 46) in all the classes combined.
Response:  If Helena has 11 kittens and each kitten eats 9 balls of yarn in one day, then how many balls of yarn will Helena need to buy for all her kittens?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of kittens = 11 Ball of yarn required per day = 9 Total number of balls of yarn needed = Number of kittens x Ball of yarn required per day = 11 x 9 = 99 balls of yarn. Therefore, Helena needs 99 balls of yarn to keep all her kittens happy!
Response:  If Helena has 10 balls and she gives 5 balls to each of her 10 friends, then how many balls will she have left?  So, Helena will have 5 balls left.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls each player will get in total and then calculate the probability of getting at least one ball from each player.  So, let's first calculate the total number of balls that Helly will get: 23 + 15 = 38 balls.  Now, we need to divide this total number of balls among the players: 38 / 4 = 9.5 balls per player (round up to 10 balls).  Since there are 4 players, each player will get 10 balls in total.  Now, let's calculate the probability of getting at least one ball from each player:  The probability of getting at least one ball from any particular player is (1 - probability of not getting any ball) = (1 - 0.27) = 0.73 or 73%.
"Response:  We have to find out how many balls each person can hold in their hand based on the total number of balls and the number of people participating in the game.  If there are 13 people playing the game and they can hold 50 balls each, then the total number of balls that can be held by all players is:

13 people x 50 balls/person = 650 balls
Now, let's calculate how many balls each player can hold if there are 26 balls left after Helly takes some balls.

650 balls - 26 balls = 624 balls
So, each player can hold 624 balls in their hand."
Response:  There are 20 balls in total and each student has to throw 5 balls. So, the number of throws for each student is 5. Now, let's assume that each ball is equally likely to be caught or not caught. Then, the probability of catching exactly x balls is (1/2)^x. Therefore, the probability of catching none of the balls is (1/2)^0 = 1. The probability of catching at least one ball is 1 - (1/2)^0 = 1. So, the probability of catching at most 4 balls is 4/5. Hence, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Helena has 28 bullets and she gives two bullets to each of her 14 friends, then how many bullets will she have left?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of bullets Helena has = 28 Bullets given to friends = 14 x 2 = 28 Total number of bullets Helena has after giving them away = 28 - (28 x 14) = 0 So, Helena will not have any bullets left after giving them all away to her friends.
Response:  We know that there are 392 pages in the book and Frank read 14 pages every day. So, to find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading pages x Number of days per page Therefore, Number of days = 392 / 14 x? Now, let's substitute the values we have: Number of days = 392 / 14 x? = 27.85 days So, Frank finished reading the book in approximately 27.85 days.
"Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages of his book every day and it took him 569 days to finish reading the entire book. So, the total number of pages he read is:

Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day
= 569 days x 22 pages/day
= 12380 pages

Therefore, there are 12380 pages in Frank's book."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank read 612 pages of his book in 7 days. So, he read an average of 87 pages per day (612/7 = 87). Now, let's find out how many pages he would have read if it took him 6 days to finish reading the entire book. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages (612) by the time taken to finish reading the book (6 days): 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 102 pages every day during those 6 days.
Response:  The book has 555 pages, and each page has 20 lines per page. Therefore, there are total 11,100 lines in the book (555 x 20). Now, we need to divide this number by 22 days to find out how many lines Frank can read in one day. So, Frank can read approximately 506 lines in one day (11,100 / 22)
Response:  We know that Frank read 193 pages of his book in 66 days. So, he read an average of 2.85 pages per day (193/66). Now, we need to find out how many chapters (or pages) Frank read each day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages he read (193) by the number of days he took to finish reading the book (66): 193 / 66 = 2.94 chapters per day. Therefore, Frank read approximately 2.94 chapters every day during those 66 days.
Response:  We know that there are 249 pages in each book and it takes 3 days to read one book. So, if we want to read all the books, it will take us 3 x 249 = 747 days to finish reading all the books.
Response:  If it takes 66 pages to read each book and there are 12 books in total, then it will take 792 days (approximately 2.3 years) to finish reading all the books. However, if Frank reads all the books simultaneously, he will need 492 days (approximately 1.5 years) to complete the task.
Response:  We have to read 16 books in 16 days. Each book has 112 pages. So, we need to read approximately 1784 pages (112 x 16) in 16 days. This is equivalent to reading around 111 pages per day (1784 / 16).
Response:  The book has 8 pages per day, and there are 576 pages in total. So, to finish reading the entire book, it will take approximately 72 days (576 / 8 = 72).
Response:  We know that Frank read 450 pages of his book in 30 days. So, he read an average of 15 pages per day (450/30 = 15). Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank will read every day from now until the end of the book. To do this, we can use the formula: Total number of pages / Remaining time = Daily pages to be read. In this case, the total number of pages is 480 (450 + 30), and the remaining time is 30 days. Therefore, Frank will read 16 pages every day (480/30 = 16) till the end of the book.
Response:  We know that Frank read 3 chapters of a book in 607 days. So, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages = Total number of pages in the book / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 594 pages, and Frank took 607 days to read it. Therefore, the number of pages he read per day is: Number of pages/day = 594 pages / 607 days = 9.5 pages/day Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read in each chapter: Chapter 1: 9.5 pages/day x 3 chapters = 28.5 pages Chapter 2: 9.5 pages/day x 3 chapters = 28.5 pages Chapter 3: 9.5 pages/day x 1 chapter = 9.5 pages Therefore, Frank read a total of 28.5 + 28.5 + 9.5 = 66 pages in the three chapters he read.
Response:  We know that Frank read 405 pages of his book in 66 days. So, he read an average of 6 pages per day. Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank read in total during those 66 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of days by the average number of pages read per day:  Number of pages read = Total number of days x Average number of pages read per day  Number of pages read = 66 days x 6 pages/day = 396 pages  Therefore, Frank read 396 pages of his book during those 66 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many dollars are equal to 120 rupees in Nepalese currency. So, we need to divide $120 by the value of one rupee in Nepalese currency. The current exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = 115 NPR (Nepalese Rupees). Therefore, we can calculate as follows: $120 / 115 NPR = 1040 NPR. So, there are 1040 Nepalese rupees equivalent to $120.
Response:  If each pizza costs $81 dollars and there are 33 vats of sauce needed for one pizza, then we can calculate how much it will cost to make one pizza as follows: Number of vats of sauce required = Total number of pizzas / Number of vats of sauce per pizza = 33 (vats) / 1 (pizza) = 33 vats So, if you want to know how many vats of sauce are needed to make 33 pizzas, we can use the same formula: Number of vats of sauce required = Total number of pizzas x Number of vats of sauce per pizza = 33 x 33 = 1091 vats Therefore, to make 33 pizzas, you would need 1091 vats of sauce.
"Response:  We have to find out how much money each person will get if there are 107 dollars and 93 dollars for each person. So, we need to divide 107 by 93 to find out how many people can be given 93 dollars each.  Therefore, the number of people who can be given 93 dollars each is:

$$ \frac{107}{93} = 11 $$

So, $11$ people can be given $93$ dollars each."
"Response:  If each dollar is equal to Rs 76, then:

1. The total value of 25 dollars = $ 25 x 76 = Rs 1800
2. The total value of 30 dollars = $ 30 x 76 = Rs 2280
3. The difference between the two amounts = Rs 2280 - Rs 1800 = Rs 480
Therefore, if one paisa is equal to Rs 76, then 30 paisas are equal to Rs 2280."
"Response:  If each pizza costs $26, and you have ordered 104 pizzas, then the total cost of all the pizzas would be:

Therefore, there are 3080 Nepalese rupees in 28 dollars.
Response:  We have 18 balls in total and we want to arrange them into 2 groups of equal size. So, we need to divide the balls equally among the two groups. Since there are 2 groups, each group will contain half of the total number of balls, which is 9 balls. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  If there are 100 groups of 40 people each in a hall with an area of 187 square meters, then we need to calculate how many people can fit in that space. To do this, we will divide the total area of the hall (in square meters) by the size of one group (also in square meters). So, if we have 100 groups of 40 people each, and the total area of the hall is 187 square meters, then we can fit: Number of people = Total area of hall / Size of one group = 187 / 40 = 4.675 people per group x 100 groups = 467.5 people in the entire hall. Therefore, approximately 467 people can fit in the hall.
Response:  We have to find out how many groups of 203 and how many groups of 63 are there in total.  If we divide 875 (total number of balls) by 203, we get 4.31 groups of 203 balls each. Similarly, if we divide 875 by 63, we get 13.89 groups of 63 balls each. So, there are approximately 4.31 groups of 203 balls each and 13.89 groups of 63 balls each.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 142 and 356 are divisible by 47 and 178 respectively.  So, we need to divide each number by 47 and 178 separately.  For 142, dividing by 47 gives us 3 with remainder 0, and dividing by 178 gives us 2 with remainder 0. Similarly, for 356, dividing by 47 gives us 7 with remainder 0, and dividing by 178 gives us 21 with remainder 0. Now, let's count the number of times each number is divisible by its respective remainders:  For 142, it is divisible by 0, 1, and 2 (remainder of division by 47) and divisible by 0 and 1 (remainder of division by 178). Therefore, the number of times 142 is divisible by each of these remainders is 3. Similarly, for 356, it is divisible by 0, 1, 2, and 3 (remainder of division by 47) and divisible by 0, 1, 2, and 3 (remainder of division by 178). Therefore, the number of times 356 is divisible by each of these remainders is also 3.  Thus, the answer is 3 x 3 = 9.

"Response:  If Brainiac has 38 cups of coffee and he wants to share it equally among his 19 friends, then each friend will get:

38 / 19 = 2 cups of coffee per friend

So, Brainiac will have 38 - (2 x 19) = 38 - 36 = 2 cups of coffee left after sharing it with his friends."
"Response:  If Brainaki has 14 friends and each friend gets 30 cups of tea, then the total number of cups of tea Brainaki will get is:

14 friends x 30 cups per friend = 420 cups of tea
So, Brainaki will get 420 cups of tea in total."
Response:  We have 5 people who made kukri and sold them for Rs. 22 each. So, total revenue generated is: 5 x 22 = Rs. 110. Now, we need to calculate the cost price of one kukri. If it takes 22 days to make one kukri, then the cost per day of making one kukri is: 22/22 = Rs. 1. Therefore, the cost price of one kukri is Rs. 110 / 1 = Rs. 110. Since there are 17 more kukris unsold than sold, the number of unsold kukris is: 17 - 5 = 12.
Response:  If Brahma had given 10 people 18 watermelons each and they equally divided among themselves, then each person would have received 18/10 = 1.8 watermelons. Now, if there were 9 people left with 18 watermelons each, then each person would receive 18/9 = 2 watermelons. So, in total, 9 people would get 2 x 9 = 18 watermelons.
Response:  We have two people, A and B, who want to share 14 cookies equally between them. So, we need to find out how many cookies each person will get. Now, let's assume that both A and B are equally hungry for cookies, so they can divide the total number of cookies equally among themselves. Therefore, the number of cookies each person (A or B) will get is half of the total number of cookies. Hence, the answer is 7 cookies per person (A or B).
"Response:  If each guest eats 2 cups of rice, and there are 10 guests in total, then the total number of cups of rice consumed is:

10 guests x 2 cups/guest = 20 cups of rice
So, if they have to prepare 100 cups of rice for all the guests, they will need an additional 80 cups (100 - 20)."
Response:  If there are 42 tukras in each chakleta and they have to share equally among themselves, then how many tukras will each one get?  We can start by dividing 42 by the number of people sharing equally (in this case, 16). So, each person will get: 42 / 16 = 2.6875 tukras per person. Since we cannot have a fraction of a tukra, let's round it off to the nearest whole number, which is 3 tukras per person. Therefore, each person will get 3 tukras from each chakleta.
"Response:  If they had eaten 26 chocolates in total and each chocolate weighed 33 grams, then they would have eaten a total of:

26 x 33 = 840 grams

So, they would have eaten 840 grams of chocolate in total."
Response:  We have to find out how many tukras Frank can make in total if he has 33 tukra molds and uses each one for 24 vats of ghee.  So, the total number of tukras Frank can make = Number of tukra molds x Number of vats of ghee used per tukra mold.  In this case, we know that Frank has 33 tukra molds and he uses each one for 24 vats of ghee, so the total number of tukras Frank can make = 33 x 24 = 756 tukras.  Now, let's assume that Frank wants to distribute these 756 tukras equally among his 9 friends.  So, the number of tukras each friend will get = Total number of tukras / Number of friends = 756 / 9 = 84 tukras each.
Response:  If there are 11 holes in each of the two pieces of cheese, and they have to be connected to make one big circle, then we need 22 holes in total (11 + 11 = 22). So, the number of chaklets that will fit around the cheese wheel is 22.
"Response:  We have two identical rectangles with an area of 16 square units each. If we cut one rectangle into 4 equal parts and another into 8 equal parts, how many squares will each part contain?  To find out, let's use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. For the first rectangle, the length is half the width, so the area is 2 times the width. For the second rectangle, the length is twice the width, so the area is 4 times the width. Now, if we divide both areas by 4 (since there are 4 equal parts), we get the number of squares in each part: Part 1: 2/4 = 0.5 squares per part; Part 2: 4/4 = 1 square per part. Therefore, each part contains 0.5 or 1 square."
Response:  We have 25 boxes of apples and each box contains 14 apples. So, in total we have 25 x 14 = 350 apples.
Response:  We have 10 boxes of chocolates and each box contains 5 pieces of chocolate. So, in total we have 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of chocolate.
"Response:  If one cup of rice is equal to 67 milliliters (as given in the question), then:

1 cup of rice = 67 ml

Now, let's convert 900 grams of rice to milliliters:

1 kg = 1000 ml (conversion factor)

So, 900 g = 900 / 1000 = 0.9 liters (approximately)

Now, we need to find out how many cups are equivalent to 0.9 liters of rice:

1 cup = 67 ml (as above)

Therefore, 0.9 liters of rice = 0.9 x 67 ml/cup = approximately 62 cups (rounded off)."
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of diet soda will be needed if we want to drink 22 liters of water and we normally drink 61 ml of diet soda per liter of water. So, firstly, let's convert 22 liters into milliliters (mL). 22 L x 1000 mL/L = 22,000 mL Now, we know that we normally drink 61 mL of diet soda per liter of water. Therefore, to calculate how many bottles of diet soda we need, we can divide the total amount of water we want to drink by the amount of diet soda we normally drink per liter of water: 22,000 mL / 61 mL/L = 357.69 bottles Of course, you cannot buy bottles of diet soda in fractional sizes, so rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us an answer of 358 bottles.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water are there in total. So, we need to calculate the number of bottles of water that are in each batch and then add them up.  In this case, there are 30 bottles of water in one batch, and there are 8 batches in total. Therefore, the total number of bottles of water is: 30 x 8 = 240 bottles.  So, the final answer is 240 bottles.
"Response:  We have:

* 79 bottles of oil (initial amount)
* 53 bottles of water (amount added to the initial amount)
* 42 vats of syrup (amount added to the initial amount)

Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles after each addition:

1. Oil: After adding 53 bottles of water, there are now 79 + 53 = 132 bottles of oil.
2. Water: After adding 42 vats of syrup, there are now 132 + 42 = 174 bottles of water.

So, the final number of bottles is:

Oil: 132 bottles
Water: 174 bottles

Therefore, the answer is 132 bottles of oil and 174 bottles of water."
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of diet soda were consumed in total and then calculate how much weight was gained or lost based on that amount.  So, firstly, we need to convert the given amounts from liters to bottles.  There are approximately 400 milliliters (L) in each bottle of diet soda.  Therefore, 54 L x 400 ml/bottle = 21600 ml of diet soda consumed.  Next, we need to determine how many calories are present in each bottle of diet soda.  According to various sources, there are around 0 calories per liter of diet soda.  Thus, the total number of calories consumed is 21600 ml x 0 calories/ml = 0 calories.  Finally, we can calculate the weight gain or loss based on the number of calories consumed.  If the person did not exercise at all during this period, they would have gained weight if they consumed more calories than their body burned off through other activities like sleeping, breathing, etc.  In this case, since no calories were consumed, there would be no weight gain or loss.
Response:  We have 17 apples and we want to share them equally among 9 people. So each person will get 1 apple. Now, there are 29 walnuts in total and we want to distribute them equally among 9 people too. So each person will get 3 walnuts. But there are only 29 walnuts left after distributing them equally among all the people. Therefore, the remaining amount of walnuts is 29 - 29 = 0 walnuts.
Response:  We have 19 bottles of diet soda and we drank 60 bottles in total. So, if we drank 60 bottles, then we must have drunk 31 bottles more than what we had initially (19 - 60 = -41). Therefore, the number of bottles that were left after drinking is (-41) / 2 = -20.5 bottles.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water are needed for 72 people to drink for 32 days and then calculate how much water is left after that.

Firstly, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 32 days is equal to 4.5 weeks (32 / 7 = 4.5).

Now, let's calculate how many bottles of water each person needs to drink per day based on the provided information. We know that there are 72 people who need to drink water for 4.5 weeks, which means they will need to drink water for a total of 315 days (4.5 x 72 = 315).

If each person drinks 8 bottles of water per day, then the total number of bottles needed for all 72 people for 315 days is:

8 bottles/person/day x 72 people = 576 bottles (total)

Now, let's check how many bottles of water are left after 72 people drink for 32 days. To do this, we simply subtract the number of days they drank from the total number of days they were supposed to drink:

Total days - Days drunk = Bottles left
315 days - 32 days = 283 days (remaining)

So, after 72 people drink water for 32 days, there are 283 days remaining, or approximately 900 bottles of water (283 days x 8 bottles/day)."
Response:  We have to find out how much water is required for each type of crop and then calculate the total amount of water needed.  For potatoes, we need 36 wat...
Response:  We have 30 bottles of oil and we want to distribute them equally among 28 people. So, each person will get 1.07 bottles (30/28). Now, let's consider the bank notes. If there are 28 banknotes of Rs 100 each, then their total value is Rs 2800 (28 x 100). Since we distributed 1.07 bottles of oil per person, the total amount of money that each person received is Rs 2594 (2800 - 1.07 x 30 = 2594). Therefore, the total amount of money that all 28 people received is Rs 69,760 (2594 x 28 = 69,760).
Response:  If one Kirana store has sold 4 bottles of diet soda at Rs.79 each, then if 79 people had bought diet soda from that store, how many bottles would they have bought in total?  Therefore, the number of bottles of diet soda sold = Total number of customers x Number of bottles sold per customer = 79 x 4 = 316 bottles.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water are there in total.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of bottles of water that can fit in one container. According to the question, one container can hold 57 bottles of water. So, the number of containers needed to fill all the bottles is:

Number of containers = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles per container
= 26 + 27 = 53 containers

Now, let's find out how many bottles of water are there in each container. According to the question, one container holds 26 bottles of water. Therefore, the total number of bottles of water in all the containers is:

Total number of bottles = Number of containers x Number of bottles per container
= 53 x 26 = 1348 bottles

So, the final answer is 1348 bottles of water."
Response:  We have 81 bottles of water and we need to fill 60 bottles with diet soda and 60 bottles with light soda. So, in total, we will use 81 x 2 = 162 bottles of water. Now, let's calculate how many bottles of each drink we can make based on the amount of water used. For diet soda, we have 60 bottles, so we can make 60 / 81 = 0.74 (or approximately 74) bottles of diet soda per 81 bottles of water. Similarly, for light soda, we have 60 bottles, so we can make 60 / 81 = 0.74 (or approximately 74) bottles of light soda per 81 bottles of water. Therefore, if we use 162 bottles of water, we can make approximately 74 bottles of diet soda and 74 bottles of light soda.
"Response:  We have:

1. 49 bottles of beer (initial amount)
2. 40 bottles of beer drunk (subtracted from initial amount)
3. 6 bottles of light beer drunk (subtracted from initial amount)

Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles of beer left after everyone drank their share:

Total bottles of beer left = Initial amount - Number of bottles drunk
= 49 - (40 + 6)
= 49 - 46
= 3

So, there are 3 bottles of beer left after everyone drank their share."
Response:  On day 317 (Monday), 31 people came to the Darbar and listened to the sermon. If there were 295 people in total who attended the sermon that day, then we can calculate the percentage of people who attended the sermon as follows:  Percentage = (Number of people who attended the sermon / Total number of people) x 100  In this case, the percentage would be:  Percentage = (31 / 295) x 100 = 10.4%
Response:  On day 703, there were 8 people who went to Bakinigham Pyales and returned.  If it took them 246 days to reach Bakinigham Pyales, then they must have started their journey on day 246 of that year. Therefore, the number of people who went to Bakinigham Pyales is equal to (day 703 - day 246) / 7 = 457 people.
"Response:  If there are 100 people who have gone to Bakinigham and returned in one day (i.e., 24 hours), then the average time spent at Bakinigham per person is:

$$ \frac{100}{24} = 4.17 \text{ hours} $$

Now, let's assume that out of these 100 people, 66 people went to Bakinigham during the daytime (i.e., from sunrise to sunset). Then, the average time spent at Bakinigham per person for those who went during the daytime can be calculated as follows:

$$ \frac{66}{24} = 2.83 \text{ hours} $$

Therefore, if 66 people went to Bakinigham during the daytime, they would spend an average of 2.83 hours at Bakinigham."
Response:  We know that there are 132 people who have gone to Bakinigham and returned after 15 days. So, if we divide 406 by 132, we get the number of days it took for 406 people to go to Bakinigham and return. Therefore, the answer is 327 days.
"Response:  If there were 45 people in the group who went to Bakinigham and returned after 82 days, then the total number of days they spent at Bakinigham would be:

Total days = Number of people x Duration of stay
= 45 x 82
= 3610 days

So, if 89 people had gone to Bakinigham and stayed for 7 days each, the total number of days they spent at Bakinigham would be:

Total days = Number of people x Duration of stay
= 89 x 7
= 6033 days"
Response:  On average, there are 71 people per day who go to Bakinigham Darbar and watch the paintings for 55 minutes each. So, in one week (7 days), 71 x 7 = 497 people will visit the place. Now, if it takes 38 days for 188 people to see all the paintings, then in one week (7 days), 188 / 38 = 5 people can see all the paintings. Therefore, the answer is 5 people.
"Response:  If there were 39 pictures of elephants in the circus and each picture had 661 people watching it per day (on average), then the total number of people who watched the elephant show per day would be:

39 pictures x 661 people/picture = 25,799 people/day

Now, if the elephant show was running for 60 days, then the total number of people who watched the show would be:

25,799 people/day x 60 days = 1,587,410 people

So, approximately 1,587,410 people watched the elephant show during those 60 days."
Response:  On day 1, there were 92 people who went to work at the office. On each of the next 4 days (days 2-5), 41 more people came to work at the office, so on day 5, there were 92 + 41 = 133 people working at the office. Therefore, in total, 133 people worked at the office during those 5 days.
Response:  On day 512, there were 80 people who went to the bank. If we subtract the number of people who went to the bank on days 471 and 808, then how many people went to the bank on day 89?  Therefore, the answer is 364 people went to the bank on day 89.
Response:  On day 705, there were 8 people who had gone to the forest for meditation.  If each person spent an average of 4 days in the forest, then how many people went to the forest in total?  We know that 191 people went to the forest in total during those 245 days. So, we can calculate the number of people who went to the forest per day as follows:  Number of people who went to the forest per day = Total number of people who went to the forest / Total number of days  = 191 / 245 = 7.63 people per day
"Response:  We know that the person has 159 grams of fat in their body and they want to reduce it to 628 grams. So, we need to calculate how much weight they can lose per day to reach their goal.  To do this, we will use the following formula:
Weight loss (in grams) = Total fat content (in grams) - Desired fat content (in grams) / Number of days
Now, let's plug in the values we have been given:
Weight loss (in grams) = 159 g - 628 g / x
where x is the number of days it takes to reach the desired fat content. Solving for x, we get:
x = 159 g / 628 g
x = 0.25 or approximately 1/4
So, if the person wants to reduce their fat content from 159 grams to 628 grams, they would need to lose about 1/4 pound (or 113 grams) of fat per day over a period of 4 weeks (which is equal to 30 days)."
Response:  We have to find out how much momo and rice are required for each person in total.  For this, we need to know the number of people who will be eating together.  If there are 49 people eating together, then they will require a total of 49 x 288 grams = 13760 grams of momo.  Similarly, if there are 288 grams of momo per person, then the total amount of momo required for all 49 people is 13760 / 288 = 48 persons worth of momo.  Now, let's calculate the amount of rice required.  Since there are 48 persons eating together, they will require a total of 48 x 260 grams = 12560 grams of rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of momo can be made from 570 grams of dough.  Since each momo requires about 22-23 grams of dough, we can make approximately 26-27 moms (570 / 22 = 26.4 and 570 / 23 = 26.6). Therefore, there are around 26-27 moms in 570 grams of dough.
Response:  We have to find out how much momo required for 166 grams of rice and then calculate how many grams of momo are needed for 20 grams of rice.  Firstly, we need to convert 166 grams of rice into equivalent amount of momo. As per the recipe, 1 cup of rice is equal to 180 grams of momo. So, 166 grams of rice is equal to 0.9 cups of momo (166/180 = 0.9). Now, let's calculate how many grams of momo are needed for 20 grams of rice. As we know that 1 cup of momo is equal to 160 grams, so 20 grams of momo is equal to 0.13 cups of momo (20/160 = 0.13). Therefore, the answer is 0.13 x 0.9 = 0.117 grams of momo are needed for 166 grams of rice.
Response:  We are given that the cost of one item is Rs.557 and we need to find out how many items can be purchased with Rs.1700.  To do this, we will divide the total amount (Rs.1700) by the cost of each item (Rs.557). So, the number of items that can be purchased = Total amount / Cost of each item = 1700 / 557 = 3.06  Therefore, approximately 3.06 items can be purchased with Rs.1700.
"Response:  We know that he has 11 grams of sugar and wants to make 492 grams of molasses. So, we need to calculate how many times he can repeat this process to get the desired amount of molasses.

We can start by dividing the total weight of molasses (492 grams) by the weight of one gram of sugar (1 gram = 0.001 kg). This gives us:

492 g / 1 g = 492,000 grams

Now, we know that he has 11 grams of sugar, so we can divide the weight of sugar by the weight of one gram of sugar to find out how many times he can repeat the process:

11 g / 0.001 kg = 11,000 repetitions

Therefore, if he repeats the process 11,000 times, he will have 492,000 grams of molasses, which is equal to 492 grams."
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 94 people who have died in the accident and their bodies are being preserved for 90 days. Now, let's calculate how many bodies can be preserved per day:

Number of days = 90 days
Number of bodies = 94 people

Now, we need to divide the number of bodies by the number of days to get the average number of bodies that can be preserved per day:

Average number of bodies per day = Number of bodies / Number of days
= 94 / 90
= 1.04 bodies per day

So, approximately 1.04 bodies can be preserved per day."
"Response:  We are given that there were 266 people in the group and they had to cross the river within 90 days. Since each person can carry only 5 kg of load per day, we need to calculate how many days it would take for all 266 people to cross the river with their belongings.

Day 1-50: In these 50 days, each person will have to cross the river once carrying their own weight (50 kg) + their belonging (5 kg). So, total number of trips = 50 x 266 = 1330 trips.

Day 51-90: In these last 40 days, each person will have to make 8 trips (since there are 40 days left and each person has to cross the river 8 times). Total number of trips = 8 x 266 = 2072 trips.

Total number of trips = 1330 + 2072 = 3402 trips.

So, it would take 3402 trips for all 266 people to cross the river with their belongings."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 294 days between January 1st, 1944 and December 31st, 1945. Since each day has 24 hours, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows: Total hours = Number of days x 24 hours/day = 294 days x 24 hours/day = 6,870 hours Now, let's convert this value from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: Minutes = Hours x 60 minutes/hour = 6,870 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 416,200 minutes Finally, let's convert this value from minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so: Seconds = Minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 416,200 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 25,536,000 seconds Therefore, the answer is 25,536,000 seconds.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 235 people who have died due to lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter.  Out of these, 77 people have died every day for the past 10 years. Therefore, the total number of deaths due to lack of access to basic necessities is:

Total Deaths = Number of People Died per Day x Total Number of Days
= 77 x 10 years
= 770

So, there have been 770 deaths due to lack of access to basic necessities over the last 10 years."
Response:  We know that there are 252 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a year is: 252 x 24 = 6048 hours per year. Now, we need to calculate how many hours the person spent studying during their lifetime. According to the question, they studied for 108 hours per day, which means they spent: 108 hours/day x 365 days/year = 38,930 hours studying per year. Therefore, the total number of hours the person spent studying throughout their entire life is: 38,930 hours/year x 57 years = 2,279,350 hours.
Response:  We are given that Auntie has Rs. 360 in her purse and she spends Rs. 8 per day on daily expenses. So, after 24 days (which is equal to 2 weeks), she will have spent a total of Rs. 8 x 24 = Rs. 192. Now, we are also given that she has Rs. 240 left after spending Rs. 192. Therefore, the remaining amount after 2 weeks is Rs. 240 - Rs. 192 = Rs. 48.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in Nepali alphabet and each letter has its own unique sound. So, if we want to find out how many sounds (or phonemes) are present in Nepali language, we need to count the number of distinct sounds for each letter.  For example, the letter ""k"" has two distinct sounds - /k/ and /kh/. Similarly, the letter ""c"" has three distinct sounds - /k/, /ch/, and /sh/. Therefore, the total number of sounds in Nepali language is:  Number of distinct sounds per letter x Total number of letters = 52 sounds  In conclusion, there are 52 distinct sounds or phonemes in Nepali language."
Response:  We know that there are 40 water buffaloes in each field. Since each field has 2 ponds, we can calculate the number of water buffaloes per pond as follows: Number of water buffaloes per pond = Total number of water buffaloes / Number of fields x Number of ponds per field Therefore, the number of water buffaloes in each pond is: Number of water buffaloes in each pond = 40/4 x 2 = 8 water buffaloes So, there are 8 water buffaloes in each pond.
"Response:  We have to find out how many trays of water and how much time it takes for each tray to fill up with water.  Firstly, we know that there are 56 vessels in total, and each vessel can hold 39 liters of water. So, the total capacity of all the vessels is:

56 vessels x 39 liters/vessel = 2174 liters

Now, let's assume that each tray can hold 10 liters of water. Therefore, we need to divide the total capacity of all the vessels by the capacity of each tray to find out how many trays we need:

2174 liters / 10 liters/tray = 217 trays

So, we need 217 trays of water to fill up all the vessels."
"Response:  We have 74 liters of water and 22 liters of milk. Each liter of water can make 46 jars of pickle (as per the given information). So, total number of jars of pickle that we can make with 74 liters of water is:

74 liters x 46 jars/liter = 3304 jars of pickle
Now, each jar of pickle requires 22 liters of milk to prepare. So, total number of jars of pickle that we can make using all 22 liters of milk is:

3304 jars x 22 liters/jar = 71,680 jars of pickle
Therefore, out of 74 liters of water, we can make 71,680 jars of pickle."
"Response:  We have to find out how many jars of water and how much weight each jar can hold.  Firstly, we know that there are 15 watermelons in total, and each watermelon weights around 10 kg (as per the given information). So, the total weight of all watermelons is:

Weight of watermelons = Number of watermelons x Weight of each watermelon
= 15 x 10 kg
= 150 kg

Now, we know that there are 62 jars of water in total. Each jar can hold 1 liter of water, so the total volume of water held by all jars is:

Volume of water = Number of jars x Volume of each jar
= 62 x 1 litre
= 62 litres

Since we want to find out how many jars of water each person gets, let's divide the total volume of water by the number of people:

Number of jars of water per person = Total volume of water / Number of people
= 62 litres / 19 people
= 3.37 jars of water per person

So, each person gets approximately 3.37 jars of water."
"Response:  We know that 13 vats of Seto Tee-shirt cost Rs. 3900. So, if we want to buy 39 vats of Seto Tee-shirts, how much will it cost us?

Answer:  The cost of 39 vats of Seto Tee-shirts = (Cost of 13 vats x 3) = Rs. 3900 x 3 = Rs. 11700"
"Response:  If there are 66 vats of Seto Tee-Shirt and each vat contains 3 sets of Tee-Shirts, then we have:

66 vats x 3 sets/vat = 198 sets of Tee-Shirts

So, there are 198 sets of Tee-Shirts in total."
Response:  We know that there are 28 pieces of t-shirts in total and we want to find out how many sets of 56 t-shirts can be made with them. To do this, we need to divide the number of t-shirts by 56, which gives us: Number of sets = Total number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts per set  In this case, the total number of t-shirts is 28, so let's plug it into the formula: Number of sets = 28 / 56  Number of sets = 0.5 or 1/2 So, based on the calculation, one set of 56 t-shirts can be made from 28 t-shirts.
Response:  We know that there are 53 pieces of Seto T-shirts and 34 pieces of Pyaant T-shirts in total. Now, we need to find out how many sets of Seto T-shirts can be made with 57 packets of fabric. To do this, we divide the number of packets of fabric by the number of pieces in each packet: 57 packets / 3 = 19 sets of Seto T-shirts. Therefore, 19 sets of Seto T-shirts can be made with 57 packets of fabric.
Response:  We have 51 vats of oil and we want to fill 3 tires with it. So, each tire will get 51/3 = 17 vats of oil. Therefore, the total number of pyeaj (packets) required to fill all 3 tires is 17 x 3 = 51 packets.
"Response:  We have been given that there are 70 vats of oil and we want to know how many sets of T-shirts (5 pieces each) can be purchased with this amount of money.  If we calculate the cost of one set of T-shirts, it will be:

Cost of one set of T-shirts = Cost of 1 vat of oil / Number of vats of oil
= Rs 140 / 70 vats
= Rs 2 per vat of oil

Now, let's find out how many sets of T-shirts can be purchased with 140 rupees:

Number of sets of T-shirts = Amount of money available for purchasing T-shirts / Cost of one set of T-shirts
= Rs 140 / Rs 2 per vat of oil
= 70 vats of oil

Therefore, if we spend Rs 140 on buying T-shirts, we can purchase 70 sets of T-shirts, each containing 5 pieces."
Response:  If there are 4 vats of water and each vat contains an equal amount (barabar samyama), then the total number of vats is 4 x 4 = 16. So, the total number of cups of water is 16 x 32 = 512 cups. Therefore, each vat contains 512/4 = 128 cups of water.
Response:  If Tapai has 33 watermelons and each watermelon weighs 11 kg, then Tapai has a total of 33 x 11 = 353 kg of watermelons. Now, if Pratik has 11 watermelons and each watermelon weighs 11 kg, then Pratik has a total of 11 x 11 = 121 kg of watermelons. So, the difference in weight between Tapai's and Pratik's watermelons is: 353 kg - 121 kg = 232 kg.
"Response:  If each pot contains 41 cups of water and there are 53 pots in total, then the total amount of water contained in all the pots is:

41 x 53 = 2191 cups

So, the number of cups of water that will spill out of one pot when it is turned upside down is:

2191 / 53 = 40.86 cups"
Response:  If there are 14 apples in total and 7 of them are red, then the number of red apples is 7/14 = 0.5 (or half) of the total number of apples. So, there are 14 - 0.5 = 13 non-red apples.
Response:  If each pot contains 3 cups of water and there are 21 pots in total, then the total amount of water contained in all the pots is: 3 x 21 = 63 cups of water. Now, if we take away 21 cups of water from each pot (which represents the amount of water that has leaked out), then the remaining water in each pot would be: 63 - 21 = 42 cups of water. So, the number of cups of water left in each pot after taking away the leaked water is 42 cups.
Response:  If Tapai has 26 vats of rice and she gives away 15 vats to her friend, then she has 11 vats left (26 - 15 = 11).  Now, if she gives away another 52 vats to her brother-in-law, then she has 0 vats left (11 - 52 = 0). Therefore, Tapai's total amount of rice given away is 53 vats (15 + 52 = 53).
Response:  If Tapain has 14 vats of rice and he wants to distribute them equally among 28 people, then each person will get 0.5 vat (14/28) of rice. Similarly, if Tapain has 28 vats of rice and he wants to distribute them equally among 86 people, then each person will get 0.32 vat (28/86) of rice. Therefore, the total amount of rice that Tapain will have after distributing it equally among all the people is: 0.5 vat + 0.32 vat = 0.82 vat.
Response:  If one daakiyal (a unit of measurement) in each block contains 5 jankha (units of weight), and there are 25 blocks in total, then the total number of jankhas in all the blocks is:  Total number of jankhas = Number of jankhas per block x Number of blocks = 5 jankhas/block x 25 blocks = 125 jankhas.
Response:  If one house has 9 vats of water and there are 20 houses in total, then each house will have 9/20 = 0.45 vats of water per house. So, if there are 20 houses with 20 vats of water each, then the total amount of water is 20 x 0.45 = 9 vats.
Response:  If there are 6 blocks in total and each block has 24 vats of water, then the total amount of water is:  6 blocks x 24 vats/block = 144 vats of water.
"Response:  If one daakiyal (a person who sells goods) can sell 14 watermelons per house, and each watermelon weighs 20 kg, then the total weight of watermelons that one daakiyal can sell in a day is:

14 watermelons/house x Total number of houses = Total weight of watermelons sold/day
= 14 x 100 = 1400 kg/day

Now, if the price of each watermelon is Rs. 50, then the total revenue generated by the daakiyal in a day is:

Total weight of watermelons sold/day x Price of each watermelon = Revenue/day
= 1400 kg/day x Rs. 50 = Rs. 70,000/day

So, the daakiyal can earn Rs. 70,000/day by selling watermelons in 100 houses."
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in one block and each house has 32 vats of water, then the total number of vats of water in that block is:

20 houses x 32 vats/house = 640 vats of water

So, if we want to know how many janks (a unit of measurement for volume) of water there are in each block, we can divide the total number of vats by the number of janks per vat:

640 vats / 16 janks/vat = 40 janks of water in each block"
Response:  We have to find out how many janks of water each house will get based on the total number of vats of water available and the number of houses.  Since there are 78 vats of water in total, and we need to divide it among 30 houses, we can calculate the average amount of water each house will receive as follows:  Average amount of water per house = Total number of vats of water / Number of houses = 78 vats / 30 houses = 2.6 vats of water per house Now, let's assume that each house requires 19 vats of water for its daily needs. So, if one block contains 30 houses, then each house in that block will require 19 vats of water per day. Therefore, the total number of janks of water required for all 30 houses in that block is: Total number of janks of water required for one block = Number of houses x Required water per house = 30 houses x 19 vats/house = 570 janks of water
"Response:  If there are 55 houses in a hulaakavala and each house has 32 meters of land, then the total length of land for all 55 houses is:

55 x 32 = 1760 meters

So, if one block contains 8 vats of land (which is equal to 8 x 32 = 256 square meters), then the number of blocks required to cover the entire area of land for all 55 houses is:

1760 / 8 = 215 blocks"
Response:  If there are 81 houses in total and each house has 4 walls, then the total number of walls is: 81 x 4 = 324 walls. Now, if each wall can hold 12 bricks, then the total number of bricks that can be placed on all the walls is: 324 x 12 = 3976 bricks. So, the answer is 3976 bricks.
"Response:  We have to find out how many janks of water each house can hold based on the size of the block and then calculate the total amount of water that all houses in the block can hold.  So, we need to divide the total area of the block (16 watas) by the area of each house (4 watas).  Therefore, the number of janks of water each house can hold is:

Number of janks = Total area of block / Area of each house
= 16 watas / 4 watas
= 4 janks

Now, let's assume there are x houses in the block. Then, the total amount of water that all houses in the block can hold is:

Total amount of water = Number of janks x Number of houses
= 4 janks x x houses

So, if there are 17 houses in the block, the total amount of water they can hold is:

Total amount of water = 4 janks x 17 houses
= 68 janks

Therefore, the answer is 68 janks of water."
Response:  We have to find out how many groups of 4 people can be formed using 10 apples and 20 golds.  To do this, we need to divide both numbers by 4.  So, 10 / 4 = 2.5 groups of 4 people can be formed using 10 apples. Similarly, 20 / 4 = 5 groups of 4 people can be formed using 20 golds. Therefore, there will be 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 groups of 4 people in total.
Response:  We have to divide 55 into 10 groups of 5 each and 15 individuals.  So, we need to make 3 groups of 5 + 2 groups of 4 + 1 group of 3 + 1 individual.
"Response:  We have to find out how many andas (units) of rice are required to make 11 groups of 2 vats each. To do this, we need to divide 11 by 2. So, the number of andas (units) of rice needed is:

$$ \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 $$

So, there will be $ 5\text {and} 5 $\text{ units of rice needed}."
Response:  We have to divide 80 sand into 4 groups of equal size. So, we will divide it into 20 sand each group (80/4 = 20). Now, let's see how many anda each group contains. Each group has 20 sand, so there are 20 x 4 = 80 anda in total.
Response:  We have to divide 30 into 4 groups of equal size. Since each group should contain an odd number of balls (since there are 15 balls in total), we can make one group with 7 balls and another group with 6 balls. That means each group will have 7 + 6 = 13 balls in total. So, the answer is 13.
Response:  We have to divide 180 andes into groups of 6-6 andes each. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make.  There are 30 andes in total (180 - 150 = 30).  Therefore, we can make 30 / 6 = 5 groups of 6-6 andes each.
Response:  We have to group 3-3 members in each team. So, we need 9 teams in total (3 x 3 = 9). Each team will consist of 1 leader and 2 followers. Therefore, there will be 9 leaders and 18 followers in total (9 x 2 = 18). Now, let's calculate the number of groups that can be formed with these members: Group size = Number of members / Number of groups = 9 members / 9 groups = 1 member per group. So, there will be 9 groups in total.
"Response:  We have to find out how many groups of 5-5 cards each can be formed using all 20 cards and how many groups of 6 cards each can be formed using all 20 cards.

Firstly, let's count the number of ways in which we can form groups of 5 cards each from the remaining 14 cards after removing the first 5 cards:

We can choose 5 cards from the remaining 14 cards in 14C5 = 35 ways.

Now, let's count the number of ways in which we can form groups of 6 cards each from the remaining 18 cards after removing the first 5 cards:

We can choose 6 cards from the remaining 18 cards in 18C6 = 379 ways.

Therefore, the total number of groups of 5 cards each that can be formed using all 20 cards is 35, and the total number of groups of 6 cards each that can be formed using all 20 cards is 379."
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 20 groups of 5 gold coins and 12 groups of silver coins. So, in total, she has 20 x 5 = 100 gold coins and 12 x 2 = 24 silver coins. Therefore, the total number of coins Rebeka has is 100 + 24 = 124 coins.
"Response:  If each round has 11 rounds and there are 154 rounds in total, then:

Round 1 to Round 11 have 11 rounds each, so the number of rounds is 11 x 11 = 121.
From Round 12 to Round 154, there are also 11 rounds each, so the number of rounds is 11 x 43 = 453.
In total, there are 121 + 453 = 574 rounds."
"Response:  If each round has 46 cards and there are 17 rounds in total, then the number of cards in one round is:

Number of cards per round = Total number of cards / Number of rounds
= 46 x 17
= 782 cards

So, if each player gets 46 cards in each round, then the total number of cards that each player will get in all 17 rounds is:

Total number of cards for each player = Number of cards per round x Number of rounds
= 782 x 17
= 13,094 cards

Therefore, the answer to the question is 13,094 cards."
Response:  If we have two roulette wheels with 84 pockets each and one ball per wheel, then in total there are 168 pockets (84 x 2). Now, if we assume that each pocket has an equal probability of landing on any number, then the expected value of the number of points earned for each round is 84/37 = 2.29 points. So, if we play 84 rounds, our average score would be 84 x 2.29 = 190.56 points.
"Response:  If each round has 157 rounds and there are 46 rounds in total, then we have:

Total number of rounds = 157 x 46 = 7082

So, if he wins every round, he will get 1 point for every round won, which is:

Points earned = Total number of rounds x 1 = 7082 x 1 = 7082

Therefore, the person will earn 7082 points."
Response:  If he got 3 marks in each round and there were 78 rounds in total, then he would have gotten a total of 3 x 78 = 234 marks. So, if he scored 78 marks more than expected, his actual score would be 234 - 78 = 156 marks.
Response:  We have 10 friends who want to play cards with each other. Each friend has 2 cards in their hand and they can use any of these cards to make a pair or a sequence. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table as a draw pile. To win the game, a player must get rid of all their cards first. If a player forms a pair or a sequence using two cards from their hand, they can discard one card from their hand and keep the other card. For example, if a player has two 5s in their hand, they can discard one 5 and keep the other 5. After forming a pair or sequence, the player can take another turn by drawing a card from the draw pile. However, if a player cannot form a pair or sequence after drawing a card from the draw pile, they must pass their turn. The game continues until only one player is left with cards in their hand. That player wins the game. So, the probability that each friend will win the game is 1/10 because there are 10 players playing the game.
Response:  We know that Emily and her friends had 11 losses in total. Each loss was worth 28 votes, so they lost a total of 28 x 11 = 308 votes. Now, we need to find out how many moties Emily had. Since each vote is equal to one moti, Emily had 308 / 1 = 308 motis.
Response:  If Emily has 8 hares and each hare gives her 16 vats of honey, then Emily will get 8 x 16 = 128 vats of honey in total.
Response:  We have 18 wickets lost and 6 wickets remaining.  Each wicket has 4 runs associated with it. So, total number of runs lost = 18 x 4 = 72. Now, we need to find out how many runs are left for each team to score. Since there are 6 wickets remaining, each team needs to score 6/6 = 1 run per wicket. Therefore, total number of runs needed for each team to win = 1 run per wicket = 6 runs.
Response:  We have 5 moti (pearls) in total. Each pearl has 4 vats (parts). So, we have 5 x 4 = 20 parts in total. Now, each part contains one moti, so there are 20 motis in total. Therefore, the answer is 20 motis.
"Response:  We have 72 people in total and each person has to carry 3 bags of rice (6 kg each). So, we need to calculate how many kilograms of rice can be carried by all 72 people together.

1. Total weight of 72 people carrying 3 bags of rice = 72 x 3 x 6 = 1086 kg

So, Emily can carry 1/72th of the total weight which is 1086 kg / 72 = 15 kg."
Response:  We have 43 people in total, and each person has to carry either 5 or 20 bags of rice. If they carry 5 bags, then there will be 860 bags (43 x 5) in total. If they carry 20 bags, then there will be 1760 bags (43 x 20) in total. So, the number of bags carried by each person is: Number of bags = Total number of bags / Number of people. In this case, it is: Number of bags per person = 1760 / 43 = 40 bags per person. Therefore, each person carries 40 bags of rice.
Response:  We have 44 people playing together and they lose 26 games. Each game lost is worth 2 points to their opponent. So, in total, their opponents get 2 \* 26 = 52 points. Now, we need to find out how many points Emily gets for winning these games. Since she won 26 games, she gets 2 points for each win, which is equal to 2 \* 26 = 52 points. Therefore, Emily gets 52 points.
Response: 81905827 = 8 x 10^6 (Since there are 8 zeros in the number)  Now, let's calculate the difference between the two numbers: 81905827 - 6682342 = 75222405  So, the difference between the number of children who went to school and those who stayed at home is 75222405.
Response:  According to the given information, in 2029, there were 2035 children who went to school during the summer vacation and returned home after 7 days. Now, let's calculate how many more children returned home compared to those who went to school. So, we have: Number of children who returned home = Total number of children x Percentage increase = 2035 x 17 = 34,555 Therefore, 34,555 more children returned home than those who went to school.
Response: 898051 is the total number of children who were vaccinated in Larne County during the period from January to December 2075. Among them, 629424 children received the vaccine at home, and 268637 children attended the school-based vaccination program. Therefore, the number of children who received the vaccine at home is 629424.
Response:  The number of children who have been vaccinated against measles in the last three years is given as 313473. Now, we are told that during the hot season (i.e., from April to June), there were 274865 children at home and 30947 children outside their homes. So, the total number of children who received the vaccine during this period is: 313473 - 274865 = 38607. Therefore, approximately 38607 children received the measles vaccine during the hot season.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation and 455628 of them go for camping. So, the number of children who don't go for camping is: 907611 - 455628 = 452083.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 88,056 children who have been vaccinated against measles at the time of writing this letter (88,056 x 100 = 8,805,600). Therefore, the number of children who have not received the vaccine is 828,554 (88,056 - 8,805,600).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6169 students in Larence School. Now, we need to find out how many of them went to the camp. We can do this by dividing the total number of students with those who attended the camp. So, the number of students who went to the camp is: 6169 / 917 = 68. Therefore, 68 students from Larence School went to the camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34049 people who have taken part in the conference and among them, 13486 are from outside the region. So, the total number of participants is 34049 + 13486 = 47535.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 61079 students in Garmeeko School and among them, 59079 students attend school regularly. Now, let's calculate the number of students who do not attend school regularly. We can assume that out of the remaining 2208 students, 2204 students have some kind of disability or health issue that prevents them from attending school regularly. Therefore, the total number of students who do not attend school regularly is 2204.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6499 students in Garmeeko School who were absent during the earthquake. Out of these, 893 students from outside the school premises also participated in the rescue work. So, the total number of students involved in the rescue work is 893 + 6499 = 7392.
"Response:  We know that Edamas has 3 vats of water and Jyaki has 9 vats of water. So, we can calculate the difference between their amounts as follows:

Edamas has 3 vats of water = 3 x 10 liters/vat = 30 liters
Jyaki has 9 vats of water = 9 x 10 liters/vat = 90 liters

So, the difference in amount of water between Edamas and Jyaki is:

90 liters - 30 liters = 60 liters

Therefore, there are 60 liters of water more in Jyaki than in Edamas."
Response:  We know that Edamas has 10 vats of syrup and Jyakies has 2 vats of syrup. To find out how many more vats of syrup Jyakies has than Edamas, we need to subtract the number of vats of syrup that Edamas has from the number of vats of syrup that Jyakies has. So, the difference between the number of vats of syrup possessed by Jyakies and Edamas is: 2 - 10 = -8 vats of syrup. Therefore, Jyakies has 8 more vats of syrup than Edamas.
Response:  We know that Jyaki has 10 vats of rice and he wants to give 9 vats to Edam. So, how many vats will be left with Jyaki after giving 9 vats to Edam?  Vats = Quantity / Number of recipients  In this case, quantity is 10 vats and number of recipients is 2 (Jyaki and Edam). Therefore, the remaining vats with Jyaki after giving 9 vats to Edam are:  Vats = 10 / 2 = 5 vats.
Response:  We know that Jyaki has 10 apples and Edam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jyaki has than Edam, we need to subtract the number of apples Edam has from the number of apples Jyaki has. So, the difference between the number of apples Jyaki has and Edam has is: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, Jyaki has 2 more apples than Edam.
Response:  We know that Edam and Jyaki are friends who have 6 apples each. Then, they share their apples equally among themselves. So, after sharing, both of them will have 4 apples each. Therefore, the total number of apples is 10 (6 + 4).
Response:  Edam and Jyaki are walking together. Edam is 9 vats ahead of Jyaki. After 7 vats, they meet again. So, in total, Edam walked for 9 + 7 = 16 vats.
Response:  We know that Edam and Jyaki are friends who have 12 apples in total.  Edam gives 9 apples to Jyaki, leaving him with 3 apples.  Now, Edam takes back 8 apples from Jyaki, leaving him with 5 apples. So, the final number of apples Jyaki has is 5.
Response:  We know that Edam and Jyaki have 4 and 10 votes respectively.  So, if we add their votes together, we get 14 votes (4 + 10 = 14).  Now, let's consider Adama and Jyaki's votes.  They have 6 and 2 votes respectively.  If we add their votes together, we get 8 votes (6 + 2 = 8).  Therefore, the total number of votes is 14 + 8 = 22 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many vats of water Jyaki has. According to the question, Jyaki has 89 vats of water. Now, we need to find out how much water Adam has. As per the question, Adam has 11 vats of water. Therefore, the difference between the number of vats of water Adam and Jyaki is: 11 - 89 = -78 vats. So, Adam has -78 vats of water.

Response:  Helen and her friends gave Helena $19 for lunch today. They also bought $231 worth of rice and $27 chips. So, in total, they spent $258.
Response:  In 1970, Helen and her husband had 197 chickens and 46 ducks. Today, they have 75 watermelons and 66 chickens. So, the number of chickens increased by 39 (75 - 46 = 39).
Response:  Helen and her husband had 519 chickens and 300 ducks in their farmhouse. Today they have sold 280 eggs and 359 chicken feed bags. So, how much money did they make today?  Based on the information provided, Helen and her husband made $419 today (280 x $1.60 = $419).
Response:  We have 81 dogs and 59 cats. If each dog plays with its toy for 30 minutes, then how many hours will the dogs play together?  Total time played by dogs = Number of dogs x Time per dog = 81 dogs x 30 minutes/dog = 2430 minutes. Now, let's calculate the total time played by the cats. Since there are 59 cats and each cat plays with its toy for 20 minutes, the total time played by the cats is: Total time played by cats = Number of cats x Time per cat = 59 cats x 20 minutes/cat = 1180 minutes. Therefore, the difference in the total time played by the dogs and cats is: Difference = Total time played by dogs - Total time played by cats = 2430 minutes - 1180 minutes = 1250 minutes. So, the dogs play with their toys for 1250 more minutes than the cats do.
Response:  In total, Katiel played 91 games with his new team and won 88 of them. His old team played 53 games and won 27 of them. So, Katiel's new team won more games than his old team. Now, let's calculate the total number of games Katiel's teams played together. Katiel played 91 games with his new team and 53 games with his old team, so in total he played 144 games (91 + 53) with both teams combined.
Response:  We know that there are 78 new games and 86 old games in total. Of these, 48 new games have been played with their friends. So, the number of new games left is 30 (78 - 48).
Response:  We have to find out how many new games and old games each of them will play.  For Ketki, we know that she will play 8 new games and 19 old games. So, her total number of games played = 8 + 19 = 27.  Similarly, for Sneha, we know that she will play 6 new games and 63 old games. So, her total number of games played = 6 + 63 = 69. Therefore, Ketki will play more games than Sneha.
Response:  Firstly, there are 62 new games and 80 old games in total.  Among the new games, there are 73 players playing them, while among the old games, there are 41 players playing them. So, the number of players who played only old games is:  Number of old games - Number of players playing old games = 80 - 41 = 39.
Response:  We know that Ketaki and her friends played 57 games of cards together and won 63 times. So, we can calculate the ratio of wins to losses as follows:  Wins = 57 / (57 + 63) = 0.48 or approximately 48%. Therefore, Ketaki and her friends won 48% of the time they played cards together.
Response:  Firstly, there are 57 new games and 39 old games in total. Among them, 34 new games have been played with their friends. So, the number of old games that were not played with friends is:  Old games not played with friends = Total old games - Number of old games played with friends = 39 - 34 = 5. Therefore, among the old games, only 5 were not played with friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $60 was spent in September and $19 was earned during the same month. So, the total amount of money that Jeansen had at the end of September is: $$60 + $19 = $79$$ Now, let's move to October. We are told that Jeansen spent $33 during this month. Therefore, the updated balance of Jeansen's account after October is: $$79 - $33 = $46$$ Finally, we have November, where Jeansen earned $19 again. So, the current balance of Jeansen's account is: $$46 + $19 = $65$$
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $86 dollars and Jessie has $5 dollars. So, in total they have $91 dollars. Now, during the week, both of them spent money as follows: Fred spent $7 dollars and Jessie spent $3 dollars. Therefore, their remaining balance is: $91 - ($7 + $3) = $81 dollars.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $19 dollars in one week and Jessica earned $16 dollars in another week. So, their total earnings for two weeks are: Fred - $19 x 2 = $38; Jessica - $16 x 2 = $32. Now, let's calculate how much they earned per day: Fred - $38 / 7 days = $5.43; Jessica - $32 / 7 days = $4.64. Therefore, Fred earned $5.43 per day and Jessica earned $4.64 per day during those two weeks."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gat got $114 in one week and then he spent $22 on car maintenance. So, his remaining amount of money is $92. Now, we are told that Jeshn earned $78 in one week. Therefore, Geshn's total amount of money after one week is $78 + $92 = $160.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how much money Fred earned in one week. As per the question, he earned $111 in seven days, so his daily earning is $16 ($111 / 7 = $16). Now, let's calculate how much money Jason earned in one month. He earned $400 in four weeks, so his daily earning is $100 ($400 / 4 = $100). Now, let's compare their earnings and find out who earned more. Since Fred earned $16 per day and Jason earned $100 per day, Fred earned less than Jason. Therefore, the answer is (A) Less than $100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $49 in his account and Jane has $30.  Now, let's calculate how much money they have gained or lost during the week.  For Fred, he gained $72 - $49 = $23.  For Jane, she gained $30 + $112 = $142.  So, the total amount of money gained by both Fred and Jane is $23 + $142 = $165.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $78 was spent in Fred's shop and $31 was earned from selling old newspapers. So, the total amount of money gained is $78 + $31 = $109. Now, we are told that Jason sold his old newspapers for $14 each, so he earned a total of $14 x 14 = $196. Therefore, the difference between what Fred spent and what Jason earned is $196 - $109 = $87.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $33 per hour working at the factory and Jessica earned $95 per hour working as a lawyer.  Now, let's calculate how much money they made in one week.  Fred worked for 40 hours, so he made $1260 ($33/hour x 40 hours).  On the other hand, Jessica worked for 74 hours, so she made $6860 ($95/hour x 74 hours).  Therefore, Fred made $1260 and Jessica made $6860 in one week.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Fred earned in total during the week. We know that he earned $47 per day and worked for 7 days, so his total earnings are: $47 x 7 = $319. Now, let's find out how much money Jason earned during the same period. According to the passage, Jason earned $99 per day and also worked for 7 days, so his total earnings are: $99 x 7 = $693. Finally, we can see that Fred earned less than Jason, as mentioned in the passage. So, the difference between their earnings is: $693 - $319 = $374. Therefore, Fred earned $374 less than Jason during the week.
Response:  Jessica can walk for 71 kilometers in one day. If she walks at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour, then it will take her 355 minutes to cover that distance (71 km / 20 km/h = 355 min). However, since she has been walking non-stop for 20 days, she has walked a total distance of 71 x 20 = 1420 kilometers (355 min x 20 days = 7100 minutes).
Response:  Jessica had $27 in her wallet and spent $101 every day. So, after 27 days, she would have spent a total of $27 x 27 = $709. Therefore, the amount left in her wallet after 27 days is $27 - $709 = $-682.
Response:  Jessie walks at a speed of 126 km/h for 6 hours and then rests for 4 hours. So, in total, she covers a distance of 126 x 6 = 756 km during her walk. Now, let's calculate how much distance she covers after taking a break of 4 hours. Since she walks at a constant speed of 126 km/h throughout, she covers a distance of 756 km / 126 km/h = 6 times 4 = 24 hours. Therefore, after taking a break of 4 hours, Jessie covers a distance of 24 x 126 km/h = 3072 km.
Response:  Jessie had 35 kilograms of rice and she gave away 69 kilograms. So, what was her remaining weight of rice?  We know that Jessie had 35 kilograms of rice initially, which she reduced to 69 kilograms after giving some away. Therefore, her remaining weight of rice is: 35 kg - 69 kg = (-34) kg.
Response:  Jessica has 114 kilos of rice and she wants to distribute it equally among 50 people. So, each person will get 2.28 kilos (114/50) of rice. Now, let's assume that there are 70 more people who want to receive rice from Jessica. If we divide the remaining amount of rice (114 - 50 x 2.28 = 36.2 kg) equally among these additional 70 people, then each person will get 0.51 kilos (36.2/70) of rice.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 9 kilos of gold. She wants to divide it into two equal parts so that she can give one part to her friend and keep the other for herself.  Now, let's calculate how many kilograms each part will be:

Part given to friend = Total weight of gold / Number of parts
= 9 kg / 2
= 4.5 kg

Now, let's see how much Jessica will have after giving one part to her friend:

Weight of gold left with Jessica = Total weight of gold - Weight of part given to friend
= 9 kg - 4.5 kg
= 4.5 kg

So, Jessica will have 4.5 kilograms of gold left after giving one part to her friend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 92 kilos of rice in her bag. She wants to distribute them equally among 56 people. So, each person will get 1.63 kilos of rice (92/56). Now, let's calculate how many kilos of rice Jesika will have after distributing them among 70 people. We know that she has already distributed 56 kilos among 56 people, so now she has 92 - 56 = 36 kilos left. To distribute these remaining 36 kilos among 70 people, each person will get 0.51 kilos of rice (36/70). Therefore, the total amount of rice Jesika will have after distributing it among all 70 people is 1.63 + 0.51 = 2.14 kilos per person.
Response:  We know that 95 vats of water were poured into a pot and then 61 vats of water were taken out. So, the remaining amount of water in the pot is 34 vats (95 - 61 = 34). Now, if 64 vats of water had been poured into the pot initially, how much water would have remained in the pot after taking out 61 vats? To find this, we need to subtract the number of vats taken out from the total initial amount of water: 64 - 61 = 3. Therefore, 3 vats of water would have remained in the pot after taking out 61 vats.
Response:  We know that 93 + 27 = 120. So, if there were 40 units of rice and 53 units of wheat, then the total number of units of food grains would be 120 - 40 = 80. Therefore, the remaining amount of foodgrains after distribution is 80 - 53 = 27.
Response:  We have to find out how many magar (units) are there in total and then calculate the percentage of each unit.  So, let's break down the given information into smaller parts:  Total number of units = 3 + 75 = 78 Units. Now, we need to find out the number of magar (units) in each group: Group 1: 82 serp (units) Group 2: 19 magar (units) Now, we can calculate the percentage of each group as follows: Percentage of Group 1 = (82/78) x 100% = 104.5% Percentage of Group 2 = (19/78) x 100% = 24.1% Therefore, the percentage of magar (units) in each group is: Group 1: 104.5% Group 2: 24.1%
"Response:  We know that there are 79 species of snakes in Nepal and if we assume that each snake gives birth to an average of 24 babies (as mentioned in the question), then the total number of baby snakes born in one year would be:

Total number of baby snakes = Number of species x Average number of babies per species
= 79 x 24
= 1856

So, if 24 serpents and 51 magarharu were born in one year, then the total number of baby snakes born in one year would be:

Total number of baby snakes = Total number of baby serpents + Total number of baby magarharu
= 1856 + 24
= 1880

Therefore, the answer is 1880."
"Response:  The farmer had 171 bags of potatoes and sold them for Rs. 30 each. Today, he has 30 more bags of potatoes. So, the total number of bags of potatoes he has now is:

171 + 30 = 201 bags of potatoes

Therefore, the correct answer is 201 bags of potatoes."
Response:  The farmer had 160 bags of potatoes and sold 56 bags today. So he has 104 bags left (160 - 56 = 104). Now, if he sells 41 bags tomorrow, he will have 63 bags left (104 - 41 = 63).
Response:  The farmer had 90 bags of potatoes and sold 154 bags today. So, he has 50 bags left. Therefore, the total number of bags of potatoes the farmer has is: 90 - 154 + 50 = 294 bags.
Response:  The farmer has 175 bags of potatoes and 77 bags of onions. If he gives away 172 bags of potatoes and 73 bags of onions as tips, how much will be left with him? So, the final amount of potatoes he will have is 175 - 172 = 3 bags. Similarly, the final amount of onions he will have is 77 - 73 = 4 bags.
Response:  The farmer has 177 bags of potatoes and 12 bags of onions. If he gives away 53 bags of potatoes and 3 bags of onions as tips, how much potatoes and onions will he have left? So, the farmer will have 124 bags of potatoes (177 - 53) and 9 bags of onions (12 - 3).
"Response:  The farmer has harvested 105 bags of wheat and 71 bags of potatoes in one day. If he had harvested 137 bags of potatoes, how many bags would he have harvested in total?

Solution:
Total number of bags of potatoes = Total number of days x Number of bags per day
= 105 + 71 +... (additional days)

So, if he had harvested 137 bags of potatoes, he would have harvested a total of:

Total number of bags of potatoes = 105 + 71 + 137 = 298 bags
Therefore, the correct answer is 298 bags."
Response:  If each pot has 4 cups of water and there are 12 pots in total, then the total amount of water is: 4 x 12 = 48 cups of water. Now, if we want to distribute this water equally among all the people living in the house, then each person will get: 48 / 6 (number of people) = 8 cups of water per person. So, the answer is 8 cups of water per person.
Response:  If each pot has 13 holes and requires 8 cups of water to boil, then how much water is required for all 17 pots to boil simultaneously?  We need to calculate the total number of cups of water needed for all 17 pots to boil.  Each pot needs 8 cups of water, so we multiply 17 by 8 to get the total amount of water needed:  Total Water Needed = 17 x 8 = 136 cups.
Response:  If each fruit has 3 seeds and there are 11 fruits in total, then the number of seeds is: 11 x 3 = 33 seeds.  And if we need to have at least 8 Nakhu (a unit of measurement) for each house, then the total number of seeds required for all houses is: 33 x 8 = 252 seeds.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many tukras (units) of water are required for each mandir ko parkhala (temple courtyard). According to the question, 12 vats of water are needed for every 10 vats of water used in the temple courtyard. So, the ratio of water required for the temple courtyard is 12:10 or 2:3. Therefore, if 15 tukras of water are required for the temple courtyard, then 45 tukras of water will be required for every 10 tukras of water used in the temple courtyard. Now, let's calculate the number of tukras of water required for one house. As per the question, if 10 tukras of water are required for every 10 houses, then 1 tukra of water is required for every 1 house. Therefore, the number of tukras of water required for one house is 1.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of the house based on its length and width. The length of the house is given as 20 meters and the width is given as 10 meters, so the total area of the house is: Area = Length x Width = 20 x 10 = 200 square meters. Now, let's assume that each tree needs at least 16 square feet (or 1.5 square meters) of space around it for proper growth. So, for 20 trees, we would need at least 320 square feet (or 30 square meters) of additional space. Therefore, the total area required for all 20 trees is: Total Area Required = 200 + 30 = 230 square meters. Since the house has an area of 200 square meters, we can safely plant 20 trees inside the house without overcrowding them.
Response:  If each pot has 74 cups and we want to fill them with water without spilling any, then we need to calculate how much water is required for one pot.  So, let's divide 74 cups by 1 cup per pot = 74 pots.  Now, if there are 36 pots in total, then we can calculate the amount of water needed as follows: Total amount of water needed = Number of pots x Amount of water per pot = 36 pots x 74 cups/pot = 2680 cups.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bricks are required for each layer of the temple and then calculate the total number of bricks needed.  For the first layer, we need 12 bricks per wat (which is equivalent to 0.3 meters) as mentioned in the question. So, the total number of bricks required for the first layer is:

12 bricks/wat x 12 wat = 144 bricks

For the second layer, we need 17 bricks per wat, which means we require:

17 bricks/wat x 12 wat = 204 bricks

So, the total number of bricks required for both layers is:

144 bricks + 204 bricks = 348 bricks

Therefore, the answer is 348 bricks."
Response:  We know that there are 3 packets of chocolates in each box and we have 42 boxes in total. So, the number of packets of chocolates = Total number of boxes x Number of packets per box = 42 x 3 = 126 packets of chocolates.
Response:  We know that there are 43 packets of chocolates and each packet contains 23 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, we have 43 x 23 = 1009 pieces of chocolate. Now, we are asked how many more chocolates Robins has than he gave to his friends. The difference between the number of chocolates given to friends and the total number of chocolates is equal to the number of extra chocolates Robins has. Therefore, the answer is 8 (the difference between 1009 and 967).
Response:  We know that each packet of Robin contains 7 tukras. So, the total number of packets of Robin = 6 watas / 7 tukras per packet = 89 packets. Therefore, there are 89 packets of Robin in total.
Response:  We have 28 packets of chocolates and each packet contains 4 pieces of chocolate. So, in total we have 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of chocolate. Now, we are asked how many kilograms (kg) of chocolate Robins has. Since each piece of chocolate weighs 0.5 troy oz or 14 grams, to convert the number of pieces to kg, we need to divide the total weight of chocolate by the weight of one piece. Therefore, 112 pieces of chocolate / 14 grams per piece = 0.79 kg. So, Robins has approximately 0.79 kg of chocolate.
"Response:  We have two packets of chocolates - one with 21 pieces and another with 45 pieces. Each piece of chocolate weighs 9 grams. So, in total, we have:

21 pieces x 9 grams/piece = 189 grams (from first packet)
45 pieces x 9 grams/piece = 405 grams (from second packet)

Now, let's find out how much Robins has gained in total:

Total weight of both packets = 189 + 405 = 594 grams
So, Robins has gained 594 grams of chocolates."
Response:  We have 28 packets of chocolates and each packet contains 6 pieces of chocolate. So, in total we have 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of chocolate. Now, we are asked how many tuktas (a unit of weight equal to 40 grams) of chocolate Robinsang has. Since there are 168 pieces of chocolate, and each piece weighs approximately 40 grams, Robinsang has 168 x 40 = 6720 grams of chocolate.
Response:  We have to make 3 minutes of shorts in total. So, we need to make 60 seconds / 3 minutes = 20 shorts per minute. Now, let's calculate how many shorts we can make in 1 hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can make 20 shorts/minute x 60 minutes/hour = 1200 shorts in an hour. Finally, we can calculate how many hours it will take to make 60 shorts as follows: 60 shorts / 1200 shorts/hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes. Therefore, it will take approximately 30 minutes to make 60 shorts.
Response:  We know that one minute is equal to 60 seconds. So, in 5 minutes, there are 5 x 60 = 300 seconds. Now, we need to convert this time into meters. The speed of an average person walking is approximately 1 meter per second. Therefore, the distance covered by a person walking at a speed of 1 meter/second for 300 seconds is: Distance = Speed x Time = 1 m/s x 300 s = 300 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Outer had 9 vats of oil and now he has 44 vats of oil. So, in one minute, he can produce 3 vats of oil. Therefore, Outer can produce 3 x 60 = 180 vats of oil in an hour.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many minutes it takes to make 13 shirts and then divide that number by 8 to find out how many minutes are required for each shirt. So, if it takes 13 minutes to make one shirt, then it will take 8 x 13 = 104 minutes to make 8 shirts. Therefore, in total, it will take 104 minutes to make 13 shirts or 8 shirts.
Response:  On Monday, he made 9 shirts and today he has finished 8 of them. So, in one minute, he can finish approximately 0.875 shirts (8/9 x 60 = 0.875).
Response:  Firstly, we know that 3 minutes are equal to 3 x 60 = 180 seconds. Now, we have to find out how many shirts can be made in 4 minutes and 8 minutes. To do this, we need to divide the time taken for each task by the number of shirts made in one minute. For 4 minutes, we can make 4 x 60 = 240 shirts, and for 8 minutes, we can make 8 x 60 = 480 shirts. Therefore, the total number of shirts made is: Total no. of shirts = 240 + 480 = 720 shirts. So, Mesin has worked for a total of 180 + 480 = 660 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the tailor can make one shirt in 6 minutes and he worked for 12 minutes today. So, he made 12/6 = 2 shirts today. Now, let's calculate how many shirts he can make in total. Since he has been working for 14 minutes today, he can make (14 x 2) = 28 shirts in total.
Response:  We know that in one minute, 60 seconds pass. So, in 5 minutes (5 x 60 = 300 seconds), 300 seconds will pass. Now, we have to calculate how many shirts can be made in 12 minutes (12 x 60 = 720 seconds). Therefore, if today Mesinle can make 5 shirts per minute and has worked for 12 minutes, then he has made 60 shirts (5 x 12 = 60).
Response:  If they can make $165 per day on average in 5 days, then their total earnings for those 5 days would be: $165 x 5 = $825. So, they made $825 in those 5 days.
Response:  The person earns $144 per day and works for 22 days in total. Therefore, their total income is: $144 x 22 = $3088.
Response:  On average, each person can play carnival games for 30 days and earn $42 per day. Therefore, in total, they will earn $1260 ($42 x 30). Now, let's calculate how much money Ring Toss game players will make in one day. If there are 22 players playing Ring Toss every day, they will earn $88 in total ($42 x 22). So, the difference between what Carnival game players and Ring Toss players will make in one day is $334 ($1260 - $88).
Response:  We know that in Carnival, there are 44 days and $382 is spent during those days. So, if we calculate the average amount spent per day, it comes out to be $\$382 / 44 = \$8.67$. Now, let's assume that for the remaining 10 days of Banki, they spend an average of $\$374$ per day, which comes out to be $\$374 / 10 = \$37.4$ per day. Therefore, the total amount spent during Banki would be $\$37.4 x 10 = \$374$. So, the correct answer is $\$374$.
Response:  We know that in Carnival, there are 20 days of games and rides, and each day has 12 hours of operation (from 10 am to 10 pm). So, total operating time for Carnival is 240 hours (20 days x 12 hours/day). Now, let's calculate how much money can be earned per hour based on the given information:  Total revenue = Number of visitors x Price per visitor x Operating hours  Total revenue = 120,000 visitors x $15 x 240 hours = $36 million Total revenue per hour = $36 million / 240 hours = $148,750 per hour
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Karnivallam made in total during his 154 days of work. As he earned $325 per day, he made a total of:

$325 x 154 = $49,700

Now, let's calculate how much money Banki made during her 57 days of work. As she earned $114 per day, she made a total of:

$114 x 57 = $6,388

So, the difference between what Karnivallam and Banki made is:

$49,700 - $6,388 = $43,312"
Response:  We know that Lucia had 10 packets of rice and she gave away 4 packets to her friend. So, now Lucia has 6 packets of rice left (10 - 4 = 6). Now, we are asked how many packets of rice Kini received from Lucia. Since Kini received 3 packets of rice from Lucia, the answer is 3. Therefore, the final answer is 6 + 3 = 9 packets of rice.
Response:  We know that Lucia packed 4 big bags and each bag contained 22 small packets of chocolates. So, in total, she had 4 x 22 = 88 small packets of chocolates. Additionally, there were 16 chocolate bars in each big bag, so the total number of chocolate bars was 16 x 4 = 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the total number of chocolate items (small packets + chocolate bars) that Lucia packed was 88 + 64 = 152.
Response:  We know that Lucia packed 23 packets of rice and some other things in 27 bags. So, each bag contains an average of 0.9 packets of rice (23/27). Now, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice Lucia packed in total. Since each packet of rice weighs approximately 1 kg, then the total weight of rice packed by Lucia is: Total weight = Number of packets x Weight per packet = 0.9 x 1 kg = 0.9 kg Therefore, Lucia packed approximately 0.9 kg of rice in total.
Response:  We know that Lucia bought 2 packets of kukri and 12 packets of rice at Rs. 56 per packet. Therefore, she spent a total of Rs. 56 x 2 = Rs. 112 on buying kukri and rice. Now, we are asked to find out how much money Lucia received in total. Since she received Rs. 56 x 12 = Rs. 672 from selling her products, we can see that she gained a profit of Rs. 672 - Rs. 112 = Rs. 560. So, the final amount that Lucia received was Rs. 560.
Response:  We know that there are 12 people in Basma's group and they have to share the cost equally among themselves. So, each person has to pay Rs. 360 (12 x Rs. 30). Now, we need to find out how many people can travel with Rs. 4000. To do this, we divide Rs. 4000 by Rs. 360, which gives us 11 people who can travel with Rs. 4000. Therefore, Ahile's group consists of 11 people.
Response:  Basma has 8 people in her group and Arkha has 12 people in his group. So, there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in total. Now, 3 people from Basma's group have gone out of the room, so there are 8 - 3 = 5 people left in Basma's group. Therefore, there are 5 people left in Basma's group.
"Response:  We know that Basanta has 13 friends and he gave Rs. 400 to each of them. So, the total amount given by Basanta is:

Rs. 13 x Rs. 400 = Rs. 5200

Now, we are asked how many people Ahile can accommodate with this money. To find out, we need to divide the total amount given by Basanta by the cost per person:

Rs. 5200 / Rs. 400 = 13

So, Ahile can accommodate 13 people with the money given by Basanta."
Response:  We know that 8 people can fit in one train compartment. So, if there are 11 people in total in the train, then each compartment has 8/11 = 0.73 people per compartment. Therefore, there are approximately 0.73 x 8 = 5.64 people in each train compartment.
Response:  We know that there are 22 leaders and 676 participants in total. Now, let's find out how many students were present among those 676 participants. To do this, we need to divide the number of participants (676) by the number of students (10). So, the number of students who were present at the event is: 676 / 10 = 67. Therefore, 67 students were present at the event.
Response:  We know that there are 73 participants in the program, including 724 students and 74 teachers. So, the total number of people involved in the program is: 73 + 724 + 74 = 1531. Therefore, 1531 people were present at the event.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there were 174 participants in the program and out of them, 521 students were present. So, we can say that for every 3 participants, there was one student present. Therefore, if we divide 521 students by 174 participants, we get 3 as the result.  Hence, the answer is 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 61 participants in the program (including 17 students). Now, let's calculate how many of them were able to attend the event. We can see from the given information that out of 61 participants, only 44 were able to attend the event. Therefore, the correct answer is 44.
"Response:  If Gupha had 919 fitness goals and he completed 1307 yoga sessions, then we can calculate his progress as follows:

Progress = (Total number of yoga sessions completed) / (Total number of fitness goals set) x 100%
= (1307) / (919) x 100%
= 45.62%
Therefore, Gupha has achieved approximately 45.62% of his fitness goals so far."
Response:  If there are 1218 people who have gone for yatra and they walk at an average speed of 4 km/hr, then the total distance covered by them is: Distance = Speed x Time = 4 km/hr x 8 hours = 32 km. Now, if 17 of them return late by 2 hours, then the total distance covered by them is: Distance = Speed x Time = 4 km/hr x 10 hours = 40 km. So, the difference in distance between those who returned late and those who completed their journey on time is: Difference = Total distance of late comers - Total distance of early finishers = 40 km - 32 km = 8 km.
"Response:  If there are 659 feet in a mile and Gupha has 762 feet of elevation gain, then we can calculate how many miles Gupha is long as follows:

Miles = Feet / Mile length
= 762 ft / 5,280 ft/mi
= 14.3 mi

So, Gupha is approximately 14.3 miles long."
Response:  We have to find out how many times Bhagodā has eaten Birālāharu's food in total.  Firstly, we know that Bhagodā ate 6 vat of Birālāharu's food and then he spilled 2 vat of it. So, the total amount of food Bhagodā ate is 6 + 2 = 8 vat. Now, we need to divide this number by the number of mouthfuls (or portions) that each vat contains. According to the passage, each vat contains 8 morsels or portions. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of mouthfuls that Bhagodā ate as follows: 8 vat x 8 portions/vat = 64 mouthfuls. So, Bhagodā ate 64 mouthfuls of Birālāharu's food in total.
Response:  We have 7 watermelons and we want to share them equally among 12 friends. So, each friend will get 7/12 = 0.58 watermelons. Now, let's assume that there are 15 banknotes of Rs 100 each. Since we don't know how many banknotes are left after sharing the watermelons, let's assume that there are exactly 15 banknotes remaining. Therefore, each friend will receive Rs 100 / 15 = Rs 6.67 per person as change from the banknotes.
Response:  We have 16 watermelons and we gave away 7 of them to our friends. Now there are 9 watermelons left with us. If we give away 2 more watermelons, then there will be 7 watermelons left with us. So, the number of watermelons left with us after giving away 2 more is 7.
Response:  We know that there are 15 watermelons in total and each watermelon has 5 seeds. So, the number of seeds in all the watermelons together is: 15 x 5 = 75 seeds. Therefore, the correct answer is 75 seeds.
Response:  We know that 23 vats of water were filled in 43 vessels. So, we need to divide 23 by 43 to find out how many vats each vessel could hold.  Therefore, each vessel could hold approximately 0.53 vats of water (23/43).
Response:  We know that the shepherd had 58 sheep and he sold 35 of them. So, the number of sheep left with him is: 58 - 35 = 23.
Response:  We have to find out how many vats of water are required to fill up the tank that holds 40 vats of water and then calculate how much water is left after filling it up to 54 vats.  Firstly, we need to convert the given quantities from vats to liters.  There are 16 lits in one vat, so: 40 vats x 16 lits/vat = 640 liters ( initial capacity of the tank)  Next, we need to calculate how much water is required to fill up the tank to its full capacity of 54 vats: 54 vats x 16 lits/vat = 864 liters ( total capacity of the tank after filling) Now, let's see how much water is left after filling the tank to its full capacity: 864 liters - 640 liters = 224 liters ( amount of water left in the tank after filling) So, the answer is 224 liters.
"Response:  We have to find out how many questions are there in each section and then calculate the total number of questions.  There are 11 questions in each section, so we can write it as follows:
Section A has 11 questions, Section B has 4 questions, and Section C has 40 questions. Therefore, the total number of questions is:
Total Number of Questions = (11 x 4) + (4 x 40) = 44 + 160 = 204 questions."
Response:  We have to find out how many boxes of 10 kg each can be filled with rice from one bag of 80 kg.  So, we need to divide 80 kg by 10 kg/box = 8 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes that can be filled with rice from one bag is 8.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 8 watermelons and 10 bags of wheat. Watermelon weight is approximately 3 kg per piece, so we need to calculate the total weight of 8 watermelons: 8 x 3 = 24 kg. Now, let's check how much space each bag of wheat takes up: 10 x 50 = 500 kg. Since there are 500 kg of wheat in 10 bags, each bag contains 50 kg of wheat. So, now we know that 1 bag of wheat weighs 50 kg. To find out how many bags of wheat can fit in 4 tons (which is equal to 4000 kg), we divide the total weight of wheat by its weight per bag: 50000 / 50 = 100 bags. Therefore, if we fill all 10 bags of wheat into one shipment, then we will have 10/100 = 0.1 or 10% extra space left over after filling all the bags.
Response:  We have 10 bags of rice with each bag containing 544 grams of rice. Since there are 32 flowers in each bag, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total weight of rice / Weight of one flower x Number of bags So, the total number of flowers is: Number of flowers = 544 g / 32 g/bag x 10 bags = 17680 flowers
Response:  We know that there are 466 bags of wheat and each bag contains 53 kg of wheat. So, the total weight of wheat in all bags is: 466 x 53 = 24,978 kg. Similarly, we know that there are 181 bags of lentils and each bag contains 181 kg of lentils. So, the total weight of lentils in all bags is: 181 x 181 = 10,018 kg. Therefore, the total weight of both wheat and lentils is: 24,978 + 10,018 = 34,996 kg.
"Response:  We know that there are 141 bags of rice and each bag contains 71 flowers and 91 leaves. So, in total, we have:

Number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers
Number of leaves = 141 x 91 = 12571 leaves

Therefore, the total number of flowers and leaves is 9671 + 12571 = 22242."
Response:  We know that each bhaanda has 40 flowers. So, if there are 400 bhandas, then there will be 40 x 400 = 16,000 flowers in total. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 16,000.
Response:  We have 452 skittles in total and we want to divide them equally among 427 people. So, each person will get 106 skittles (452 / 427 = 106).
Response:  We have to find out how many skittles are in 3941 skittles and then divide it by 4950 erasers. So, we can calculate as follows: Number of Skittles = 3941 Erasers = 4950 x (Number of Skittles / Number of Erasers) = 4950 x (3941/4950) = 4950 x 0.82 = 3765 erasers Therefore, each group of 4950 erasers contains approximately 3765 skittles.
Response:  We have 896 skittles in total and we want to divide them equally among 517 erasers. So, each eraser will get 896/517 = 1.73 skittles. Now, if we had 8 sampoohs (groups) of equal size, each group would get 1.73 x 8 = 13.44 skittles.
Response:  We have 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, there are 270/5 = 54 classes. Now, we need to find out how many students are in each class. Since there are 5 students in each class, the total number of students in all classes is 54 x 5 = 270. Therefore, the answer is 270.
"Response:  We have 304 classes in total and each class has 75 students. So, the total number of students is:

304 classes x 75 students/class = 22,800 students

Therefore, there are approximately 22,800 students in the school."
