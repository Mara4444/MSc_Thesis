Response: 8 (20 - 12 = 8)
Response: 12 - 11 = 1. Julia played with one more child on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response: 10 (Julia played with 5 kids on Monday and 10 kids on Tuesday)
"Response: 12
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday.
* She played with a total of 16 kids.

Since we know that Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday, we can deduce that she played with 2 more kids on Monday (since 14 + 2 = 16). Therefore, Julia played with 12 kids on Monday."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Julia played tag with 16 kids on Monday and 12 more kids on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 16 + 12 = 28 kids on both days combined. Therefore, she played with 28 - 16 = 12 kids on Tuesday."
"Response: 22
Explanation: Julia played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday and 8 more kids on Monday, so she played with 14 + 8 = 22 kids on Monday."
Response:  Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 kids in total.
"Response: 
Monday - Julia played with 15 kids.
Tuesday - Julia played with 18 kids.
Total number of kids = 15 + 18 = 33 kids."
"Response: 
Monday - Julia played with 5 kids.
Wednesday - Julia played with 15 kids."
"Response: 
On Tuesday Julia played with 14 kids (given in the problem).
On Wednesday Julia played with 16 kids (given in the problem)."
Response: 2 (seven minus five) = 2 more kids did Julia play with on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response: 14 - 8 = 6
Julia played with 6 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday."
Response: 2 (11 - 9 = 2)
"Response: 
Monday - 15 + Tuesday = 18 + Wednesday = 7

So, Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 more kids on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday."
Response:  Julia played with 23 kids in total (13 + 10 + 15).
Response: 7 + 13 = 20. Julia played tag with 20 kids in total (7 on Monday and 13 on Tuesday).
"Response: 
Let's say Julia played with x kids on Monday and y kids on Tuesday. We know that x + y = 12 (kids on Monday) and x + y = 14 (kids on Tuesday). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 8 (kids on Monday)
y = 6 (kids on Tuesday)
So, Julia played with 8 kids on Monday and 6 kids on Tuesday, for a total of 14 kids."
Response: 19 - 18 = 1 more kid played with on Monday than Tuesday.
Response: 1 (one) more kid did Julia play with on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response: 18 - 4 = 14
Explanation: Julia played with 4 kids on Monday, so there are 18 - 4 = 14 kids left to be played with on Tuesday."
"Response: 6 - 4 = 2

Explanation: Julia played with 6 kids on Monday and 4 kids on Wednesday, so there are 6 - 4 = 2 more kids that she played with on Monday than on Wednesday."
Response: 18 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby ate 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy and 14 pieces of chocolate, for a total of 51 candies and chocolates eaten by Bobby.
"Response: 22 more pieces of candy than chocolate did Bobby eat.
Explanation: To determine this, we need to calculate the total number of candies and chocolates that Bobby ate separately first. Then, we can compare them to find out how much more candy Bobby ate compared to chocolate.

Total number of candies = 38 + 36 = 74
Total number of chocolates = 16

Since the difference between the total number of candies (74) and the total number of chocolates (16) is 58, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate. Therefore, the correct answer is 58."
Response:  Bobby ate 34 + 18 = 52 pieces of candy.
"Response: 7 pieces of candy are left.
Explanation: Bobby started with 21 candies and ate 5, so he has 21 - 5 = 16 candies left. Then he ate another 9 candies, so he has 16 - 9 = 7 candies left."
"Response: 14 pieces of candy Bobby had eaten before he ate an additional 5 candies.  
Explanation: Bobby started with 22 pieces of candy and ate some pieces (not specified in the problem). After that, he ate five more candies, leaving him with eight pieces of candy remaining. To determine how many pieces of candy Bobby had eaten initially, subtract the number of pieces he had left after eating five more from the total number of pieces he had to begin with: 22 - 8 = 14. Therefore, Bobby had eaten 14 pieces of candy at the beginning."
Response:  Bobby has 17 pieces of candy left after eating 2 pieces.  
"Response: 12 (pieces of candy eaten by Bobby)

Explanation: If Bobby started with 32 pieces of candy and now has 20 pieces left, then he must have eaten 12 pieces of candy (32 - 20 = 12)."
"Response:  Bobby has 21 pieces of candy left after eating 17 and 15 additional candies.  
Explanation:  To determine how many candies Bobby has left, we need to subtract the number of candies he ate from his initial amount. If Bobby started with 36 candies and ate 17 + 15 = 32 candies, then he has 36 - 32 = 4 candies left."
Response: 7 (Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left after eating 23)

Response: 14 - 6 = 8 more green peaches than yellow peaches.
Response: 19 - 11 = 8 more red peaches than yellow peaches.
Response: 6 + 16 = 22 red or green peaches are in the basket.
Response: 18 (red) + 14(yellow) = 32
"Response: 6 + 14 = 20 (total number of peaches)
6 (number of green peaches) + 14 (number of yellow peaches) = 20"
"Response:  There are 65 baskets with 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches each, so the total number of peaches is:

65 x (7 + 3) = 65 x 10 = 650 peaches per basket."
"Response: 
There are 11 baskets with a total of 11 x 20 = 220 peaches (10 red + 18 green per basket)."
Response:  There are 6 x 16 = 96 red peaches in total.

Response: 6 - 2 = 4 more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket.
Response: 4 (the number of action figures Jerry already had) + 8 (the number of new action figures he added) = 12. So Jerry added 8 action figures to the shelf.
Response: 3. Jerry had three action figures on the shelf initially.
Response: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures were on Jerry's shelf in all.
Response: 7 (action figures) - 9 (books) = 8. Jerry had 8 more action figures than books on his shelf.
"Response: 6 more books than action figures were on Jerry's shelf.

Explanation: Let X represent the number of action figures Jerry had initially (X = 2).
Let Y represent the number of books Jerry had initially (Y = 10).
After adding four more action figures, Jerry now has X + 4 action figures (X + 4 = 6)
Since there are six more books than action figures, we can set up an equation as follows:

Y + 6 = X + 4 + Y

Simplifying this equation yields:

Y + 6 = 2 + 10

Solving for Y gives us:

Y = 6

Therefore, Jerry had six more books than action figures on his shelf after adding four more action figures."
Response: 9 + 10 = 19 books were on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response: 7 (action figures) - 2 (books) = 5 more action figures than books were on Jerry's shelf.
Response: 14 (number of books) - 5 (action figures) = 9. Jerry had 9 more books than action figures on his shelf.
"Response: 12 action figures were on Jerry's shelf in all. Here is the calculation:

8 (initial number of action figures) + 4 (newly added action figures) - 5 (removed action figures) = 12"
Response: 3 action figures were removed by Jerry from the shelf as he added four new ones.
Response: 3 action figures were added by Jerry to the shelf.
Response: 8 action figures were present on Jerry's shelf initially.
"Response: 9 (action figures) + 7 (more action figures) = 16
16 - 10 (books) = 6
Therefore, Jerry has 6 more action figures than books on his shelf."
Response: 6 (action figures) - 3 (books) = 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
"Response: 4 more books than action figures were on Jerry's shelf.

Explanation: Let X represent the number of action figures on Jerry's shelf (X = 3). Since we know that Jerry started with 7 books, let Y represent the number of books on his shelf (Y = 7). After adding two more action figures, the total number of items on the shelf is:

X + Y + 2 = 3 + 7 + 2

Simplifying the equation:

9 = Y + 2

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

Y = 7

Therefore, there were 7 books on Jerry's shelf initially, and 3 action figures. So, the difference between the number of books and action figures was:

7 - 3 = 4

Hence, there were 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf."
Response: 4 (four) birds have come to sit on the fence as there are already two birds sitting on the fence and four more birds have joined them.
Response: 3 birds were already sitting on the fence before the other 4 birds joined them.
Response: 50 birds (4 + 6 = 10 + 46)
Response: 3 + 5 = 8 birds are sitting on the fence. Since there are already two storks (2) sitting on the fence, in total, there will be 8 birds and 2 storks (i.e., 10 animals) sitting on the fence after five more birds come to join the original three birds.
"Response: 3 (birds) + 2 (more birds) = 5 birds.
4 (storks) + 2 (more storks) = 6 storks.
Therefore, there are 5 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence."
Response: 6 (storks) - 2 (birds) = 4 more storks than birds are sitting on the fence.
Response: 6 + 2 = 8 storks are sitting on the fence.
Response: 3 + 6 = 9 birds and 4 + 6 = 10 storks are sitting on the fence.
Response: 6 (birds) + 3 (storks) = 9. So there are 9 animals sitting on the fence in total.
Response: 6 more storks joined the existing 3 storks, so there are now 9 storks in total (3 + 6). The number of birds remains unchanged at 4. Therefore, there are 9 storks and 4 birds sitting on the fence, with 9 - 4 = 5 more storks than birds.
Response: 10 birds are sitting on the fence.
Response: 5 (more birds) - 4 (more storks) = 1 (more bird than stork).
Response: 6 more storks than birds are sitting on the fence.
Response: 7 (birds) - 5 (storks) = 2. There are two more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
Response: 6 (storks) + 2 (birds) = 8. If 3 more birds come to join them, then there will be 2 + 3 = 5 birds in total. So, there are 8 - 5 = 3 storks more than birds sitting on the fence.
Response: 6 more storks = 6 + 0 (birds) = 6 more storks than birds.
Response: 37 pages (48 - 11 = 37)
Response: 80 - 37 = 43 pages.
"Response: 33 pages (calculation below)

Explanation:
Total number of pages = 60 + 33 = 93
First Chapter = 60 pages
Second Chapter = Total - First = 93 - 60 = 33 pages"
Response: 67 - 36 = 31 pages.
Response: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
"Response: 
The difference between the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the second chapter can be calculated as follows : 
First Chapter - Second Chapter = (91) - (23) = 68 pages 
Therefore, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter."
"Response: 
The second chapter has 18 pages, while the third chapter has 3 pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the third chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:

18 - 3 = 15

So, the second chapter has 15 more pages than the third chapter."
"Response: 
The difference between the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the third chapter can be calculated as follows:

Difference = (Number of pages in the first chapter) - (Number of pages in the third chapter)
= (53) - (21)
= 32

Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter."

"Response: 
Let's say Doug initially had x marbles and Ed had x + 2 marbles. After losing some marbles, Doug has x - y marbles, where y is the number of marbles he lost. Since Ed still has x + 2 marbles, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x - y = (x + 2) + 19...(1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - y = x + 3...(2)

Solving for y, we get:

y = 3x - 2...(3)

Now, we know that Doug lost 3x - 2 marbles."
"Response: 34
Explanation: If Ed has 45 marbles and Doug loses 11 marbles, then Doug has 11 fewer marbles than Ed. So, Ed has 45 - 11 = 34 more marbles than Doug."
"Response: 15

Explanation: If Ed has 22 marbles and Doug loses 7 marbles, then Doug will be left with 7 fewer marbles than Ed. So, Doug has 22 - 7 = 15 marbles now."
"Response: 
Doug had 24 marbles initially."
"Response: 13 more marbles.
Explanation: Let's start by identifying what we know about the situation:

* Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug initially.
* Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground.
* Ed found 9 more marbles.

We can represent this information using an equation:

Ed = Doug + 24... (1)

Since Doug lost 27 marbles, we can subtract 27 from his initial amount to find out how much he has left:

Doug = 0 (since he lost all his marbles)

Now, let's add Ed's newfound marbles to his original total:

Ed = Doug + 24 + 9... (2)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

Ed = 0 + 24 + 9

Simplifying, we get:

Ed = 33

So, Ed had 33 marbles in total, which is 13 more than Doug had."
Response: 13 (Ed had 13 more marbles than Doug)
"Response: 12
Explanation: Ed initially had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 19 + 0 = 19 marbles and Doug had 0 marbles. After losing some marbles at the playground, Ed now has 19 - x marbles, where x is the number of marbles he lost. Since Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation:

19 - x = 8 + 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, Ed lost 12 marbles at the playground."
"Response: 75

Explanation: Let's break down the information we know:

* Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So, if Doug had x marbles, Ed had x + 30 marbles.
* Ed lost 21 marbles at the playground. So, after losing those marbles, Ed has x + 30 - 21 = 75 marbles left.

Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 30 - 21 = 75

Simplifying the equation:

x + 30 = 75 + 21

Solving for x:

x = 46

So, Doug had 46 marbles before Ed lost any marbles. And since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, Ed had 46 + 30 = 76 marbles before losing any marbles."
"Response: 17 - 20 =  3
Doug has 3 marbles now."
"Response: 408 - 42 = 366

Explanation: To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon (42) from the total number of students who made suggestions (408). The difference is 366, which means that 366 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon."
Response: 10 more students suggested bacon than mashed potatoes.  
Response: 185 - 15 = 170 (students who suggested adding bacon)
Response: 264 - 288 = 24 (students who suggested mashed potatoes)
Response: 63 students suggested bacon.
Response: 166 + 182 = 348 students suggested bacon.
Response: 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in suggesting new food items.
Response: 67 (mashed potatoes) - 120 (bacon) = 37 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon.
Response: 328 (mashed potatoes) - 79 = 249 more students suggested mashed potatoes than tomatoes.
Response: 314 (337 - 23) = 314 more students suggested bacon than tomatoes.
Response: 38 + 450 = 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.
Response: 351 + 218 = 569 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response: 330 - 269 = 61 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.
Response: 333 (girls) - 236 (boys) = 97 more girls than boys.
Response: 841 - 34 = 807. So, the school has 807 more boys than girls.
"Response:  There are 232 girls + x boys = 485 students in total.
x = 485 - 232 = 253 boys."
"Response: 
Let X be the number of boys in the school. Then we know that the total number of students is 697 + X. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, the number of girls is 697 + X + 228 = 697 + X + (228). Simplifying this equation, we get:
X + 228 = 697
Subtracting 228 from both sides gives us:
X = 469
Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school."
Response:  There are 635 girls + (510 more boys) = 635 + 510 = 1145 boys in the school.
"Response: 
There are x number of boys in the school.
Since there are 868 girls, then the total number of students is 868 + x.
We know that there are 281 more girls than boys, so we can write an equation based on this information:
x = (868 - 281)
Solve for x to find out how many boys are in the school.
Once you have found out how many boys are in the school, add that number to the number of girls to get the total number of students in the school."
"Response: 
There are 700 girls + (142 more boys) = 700 + 142 = 842 students in the school."
"Response: 
There are currently 706 + 418 = 1124 students in the school."
Response: 902 + 44 = 946 girls in the school now.
Response: 257 more girls than boys (632 + 465 = 1097)
Response: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls.
"Response: 
Let's say that after adding new students, the total number of girls is x + 496 and the total number of boys is y + 910.
We know that initially, there were 135 girls and 214 boys, so we can set up equations based on these numbers:
x + 496 = 135 + (496 - 135) = 135 + 361 = 496
y + 910 = 214 + (910 - 214) = 214 + 706 = 910
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving for x and y gives us:
x = 496
y = 910
So, there are 496 girls and 910 boys in the school now."
"Response: 
There are 308 + 318 = 626 students in the school."
"Response: 315 + 309 = 624 (total number of students)
624 + 772 = 1396 (total number of people in the school including students and teachers)."
Response:  There are 739 - 402 = 337 boys in the school.
Response: 1300 (692 + 458)
"Response: 196 more girls than boys (calculation below)

Explanation:
Let's first find out how many students the school has altogether after the new girls join:
Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
= 362 + 257 + 403
= 822
Now, let's compare the number of girls to the number of boys:
Number of girls - Number of boys = Total number of girls - Total number of boys
= 257 + 403 - 362
= 196
Therefore, the school has 196 more girls than boys."
"Response: 
Edward has $2 left after spending $16.

Question: if johnny has 5 pencils and gives 3 to his friend, how many pencils does johnny have left?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: 
Johnny has 2 pencils left after giving 3 to his friend."
"Response: 
Let's say Edward spent x dollars. We know that he started with $13 and now has $3 left. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

$13 - x = $3

Now solve for x by adding $13 to both sides of the equation:

$13 + ($13 - x) = $3 + $13

Simplify the right side of the equation:

26 = 4x

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 6

So Edward spent $6."
"Response: 
Before Edward spent any money, he had $9 + $8 = $17."
"Response: 
Let's say Edward had x dollars before spending his money.
We know that he spent 92 dollars on books, so we can write an equation based on this information:
x - 92 = 6... (1)

Now, let's solve for x by adding 92 to both sides of the equation:
x = 92 + 6... (2)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
92 + 6 - 92 = 6

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 78

Therefore, Edward had $78 before spending his money."
"Response: 
Let's say x is the cost of one book. Since Edward bought two books, the total cost would be 2x.
We know that Edward spent $12 in total, so we can set up an equation:
2x = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So each book costs $6."
"Response: 
Before Edward spent his money,he had $ (19-6) =$ 13."
"Response: 
Let's say Edward spent x dollars on books and y dollars on pens. We know that x + y = 12 (total amount of money Edward had).
We also know that x + 3 = 4 (amount of money Edward spent on pens).
Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 9 (amount of money Edward spent on books)
y = 3 (amount of money Edward spent on pens)
Therefore, Edward spent $9 on books and $3 on pens."
"Response: 
Let's say Edward spent x dollars on books and y dollars on pens. We know that x + y = 16 (the total amount of money Edward spent) and y = 8 (the amount of money Edward spent on pens). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 16 - 8 = 8
y = 8
So, Edward spent 8 dollars on books and 8 dollars on pens. To find out how much more Edward spent on books than pens, we need to subtract the amount spent on pens from the amount spent on books:
Difference = 8 - 8 = 0
Therefore, Edward spent the same amount on both books and pens."
"Response: 
Before Edward spent any money, he had $17.

Question: If Sally spent $25 and then received $15 as a gift, how much does she have left?
Based on the information provided, formulate an algebraic expression to represent the situation.
Answer:
Let's say that Sally had x dollars before she spent any money.
After spending $25, she is left with x - $25.
Then, she receives $15 as a gift, so she now has x - $25 + $15 = x + $15."
Response:  Zachary did 44 push-ups, David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary so David did 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, together they did  44 + 102 = 146 push-ups.
Response: 7 (Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David)
Response: 35 (Zachary did 35 push-ups)
Response: 51 + 49 = 100.
Response:  David did  59 + 19 = 78 push-ups.
Response:  David did  13 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did 17 - 13 = 4 crunches.
Response:  Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches.
Response: 29 more push-ups (58 - 35 = 29) and 10 fewer crunches (-87 + 3 = 10).
Response: 10 more crunches than push-ups.
"Response:  David did  52 push-ups (calculation below)

Step by step calculation to find out how many push-ups David did :

Let X be the number of push-ups Zachary did. Since we know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, we can write an equation as follows:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39

We are also given that John did 13 push-ups less than David. So we can write another equation as follows:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 13

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (X and David's push-ups). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

Zachary's push-ups = 19
David's push-ups = 19 + 39 = 52

Therefore, David did 52 push-ups."
"Response: 39 (calculation below)

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Zachary did 51 push-ups.
David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary.
John did 4 push-ups less than David.

We can start by finding out how many push-ups David did:

David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so:

David did 51 + 22 = 73 push-ups

Now we know that John did 4 push-ups less than David, so:

John did 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups

Therefore, John did 69 push-ups."
Response:  Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 9 fewer push-ups than David, so John did  6 (9 - 3) = 6 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 15 + 6 = 21 push-ups more than John.
Response:  Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 push-ups.
Response: 94 (38 + 56)
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know from the problem:
Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches.
David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 34 + 40 = 74 push-ups.
David did 17 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches.
Therefore, David did 74 push-ups and 45 crunches."
Response: 25 (push-ups) + 5 (crunches) = 30.
Response:  Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups (17 - 5 = 12).

"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 36 inches
Frog: x inches (where x is the distance the frog jumped)
Mouse: x + 15 inches (where x is the distance the frog jumped)
We also know that the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can set up an equation based on that information:
Frog - Grasshopper = 17
Now we have two equations and three unknowns (x, x + 15, and 36). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x. Let's use substitution.
First, solve Equation 2 for x:
x + 15 = Mouse
Next, substitute this expression into Equation 1:
(Frog - Grasshopper) = 17
Substitute x + 15 for Frog - Grasshopper:
17 = 17 + 15
Simplify:
32 = 32
This tells us that both equations are true, so all three animals jumped the same distance. Therefore, the frog jumped 36 inches just like the grasshopper."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 25 inches
Frog: 18 inches farther than Grasshopper (so Frog jumps = Grasshopper + 18)
Mouse: 2 inches farther than Frog (so Mouse jumps = Frog + 2)
Now let's calculate each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 25 inches
Frog: 25 + 18 = 43 inches
Mouse: 43 + 2 = 45 inches
Therefore, the mouse jumped 45 inches."
"Response: 
Let's start by finding out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
Frog's distance = Grasshopper's distance + 10 inches
We also know that the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so we can set up another equation:
Mouse's distance = Frog's distance + 20 inches
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Grasshopper's distance and Mouse's distance). Can you use these equations to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper?"
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 19 inches
Frog: x (we don't know yet)
Mouse: -94 inches (-94 is negative because it means the mouse jumps less than the others)
We also know that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 39 inches
Now we can set up an equation based on these statements:
19 + 39 = x
58 = x
So, the frog jumped 58 inches."
"Response: 
Let's assume that the distance traveled by the frog is x inches. Since the mouse jumps 26 inches less than the frog, the distance traveled by the mouse would be x - 26.
We know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

Grasshopper (G) = 25
Frog (F) = G + 32
Mouse (M) = F - 26

Now solve for M to find out how far the mouse jumped:

M = F - 26
= (G + 32) - 26
= G + 32 - 26
= 25 + 32 - 26
= 41

Therefore, the mouse jumped 41 inches."
"Response: 19 inches (calculation below)

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Grasshopper jumped 24 inches
* Frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper
* Mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog

We can start by finding out how far the frog jumped:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 33 inches
= 24 inches + 33 inches
= 57 inches

Now we know that the frog jumped 57 inches. Let's find out how far the mouse jumped:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 5 inches
= 57 inches - 5 inches
= 52 inches

So the mouse jumped 52 inches. Now we need to find out how much farther the mouse jumped compared to the grasshopper:
Distance between mouse and grasshopper = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
= 52 inches - 24 inches
= 28 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper."
"Response: 
Let x be the distance that the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, we know that the grasshopper jumped x + 2 inches. We are also given that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 2 = 13
Solving for x, we get:
x = 11
So, the frog jumped 11 inches."
"Response: 
The frog jumped 31 inches (35 - 4 = 31)."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 19 inches (G)
Frog: x inches (F)
Mouse: 44 inches less than F (M = F - 44)
We also know that the Grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the Frog, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
G = F + 4
Now we have two equations and three unknowns (G, F, M). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for G, then find F and M. Let's use substitution.
Substituting G into the first equation, we get:
F + 4 = 19
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:
F = 15
Now we know F is equal to 15, so we can substitute it back into the second equation to find M:
M = F - 44
M = 15 - 44
M = -29
So the Mouse jumped 29 inches less than the Frog. Finally, we can find the Frog's jump distance by adding the difference between the Mouse and Frog's jumps to the Frog's distance:
F + (-29) = 15 + (-29)
F = 15 - 29
F = 6
Therefore, the Frog jumped 6 inches."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 39 inches (given)
Frog: x inches (unknown)
Mouse: x - 12 inches (unknown)
We know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so we can set up an equation based on that information:
Grasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + 19 inches
Now, we also know that the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so we can set up another equation based on that information:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 12 inches
Substituting the first equation into the second one gives us:
Mouse's jump = (Frog's jump + 19 inches) - 12 inches
Simplifying and solving for the mouse's jump distance, we get:
Mouse's jump = (x + 19) - 12
= x + 7
So, the mouse jumped 7 inches."
"Response: 
Let's assume that the distance jumped by the frog is x inches. Then, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches more than the frog, so its distance jumped would be x + 25. The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so its distance jumped would be x - 16. We are asked to find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse. To do this, we need to subtract the distance jumped by the mouse from the distance jumped by the grasshopper:

x + 25 - (x - 16) =?

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 25 - x + 16 =?

Solving for the unknown variable x, we get:

x + 25 - x + 16 = 25 + 16 = 41

So, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse."
Response: 22 inches (39 - 17)
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 9 inches
Frog: 33 inches more than Grasshopper (so Frog jumps = Grasshopper + 33)
Mouse: 3 inches less than Frog

Now let's set up an equation to represent this information:

Grasshopper + Mouse = Frog

Substituting the values we know:

9 + Mouse = 33 + 9

Solving for Mouse:

Mouse = 24

So the mouse jumped 24 inches."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about each animal's jump distance:
Grasshopper: 14 inches
Frog: x (we don't know yet)
Mouse: 16 inches less than the frog
We can begin by finding out how far the frog jumped based on the information that it is 37 inches farther than the grasshopper:
x = 37 + 14 = 51 inches
Now we know that the frog jumped 51 inches. Since the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, we can find its jump distance as follows:
Mouse jump distance = Frog jump distance - 16 inches
= 51 inches - 16 inches
= 35 inches
Therefore, the mouse jumped 35 inches, which is 21 inches fewer than the grasshopper's jump of 56 inches (35 + 14)."

"Response: 
Let's say Mary has already added x cups of flour to her cake batter. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour according to the recipe, then we can set up an equation as follows:

13 - x = 12 + x (since she needs 12 more cups)

Solving this equation, we get:

x = 1 cup (since 13 - 1 = 12 + 1)

Therefore, Mary has already added 1 cup of flour to her cake batter."

* Paul received a total of x crayons as a birthday gift.
* By the end of the school year, he had either lost or given away 551 - x crayons.
* He only had 177 crayons left.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 551 = 177 + x

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 551 = 177 + x

Subtracting 177 from both sides:

2x = 384

dan had $5 initially because $3 - $2 = $5."
"Response: 
The amount of money Dan had before buying the candy bar is $3.
He spent some amount of money to buy the candy bar and now he has $4.
So, we can set up an equation based on this information:
$3 + x = $4...(1)
where x is the cost of the candy bar.
Solving for x, we get:
x = $4 - $3
= $1
Therefore, the candy bar cost $1."
"Response: 
dan spent $ 3 x 99 = $297 on candy bars.
he has $4 - $297 = $4 - $297 = $0 left."
"Response: 
Each candy bar costs $ 4. 
Explanation : 
Dan spent $ 3 and bought two candy bars, so the total cost is $ 3 x 2 = $ 6. 
Since each candy bar costs the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost by 2 to find out the cost of each candy bar : 
$ 6 / 2 = $ 3 per candy bar."
"Response: 
dan spent $ 2 x 3 = $ 6 to buy candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $ 6, he can buy only one candy bar with $ 2. So, Dan bought one candy bar."
"Response: 
dan has $5 left after buying a candy bar and a chocolate."
"Response: 
dan spent $ 13 on the candy bar and chocolate because $ 7 + $ 6 = $ 13."
"Response: 
To find out how much Dan spent buying the candy bar compared to the chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the total amount he spent.
Total Amount Spent = Cost of Candy Bar + Cost of Chocolate
= $6 + $3
= $9
Subtracting the cost of the chocolate from the total amount spent gives us the difference:
$9 - $3
= $6
Therefore, Dan spent $6 more buying the candy bar than he did buying the chocolate."
"Response: 
To find out how much more Dan spent on buying chocolate compared to the candy bar, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the total amount he spent on both items.
Total Amount Spent = Cost of Candy Bar + Cost of Chocolate
= $2 + $3
= $5
Since Dan spent $5 in total, he spent $3 on the chocolate and $2 on the candy bar. Therefore, he spent $1 more on the chocolate than on the candy bar."
"Response: 
$ 4 - $ 8 = $ (negative amount)
$ (negative amount) + $ 5 = $ 9
So, there is $ 9 left after Dan's friend gave him $ 5."
"Response: 
The amount of money Dan had before buying the candy bar is represented by x = 4.
After purchasing the candy bar, he has $3 remaining; therefore, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:

x - 4 = 3...(1)

Solving for x in equation (1), we get:

x = 3 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the candy bar costs $7."
"Response: 
$ 3 - (10 x $ 4) = $ 3 - ($ 4 x 10) = $ 3 - $ 40 = $ 3 - $ 40 = $ 36
Therefore, Dan has $ 36 left after buying 10 candy bars."
"Response: 
Each candy bar costs $2."
"Response: 
To find out how much Dan spent on buying a candy bar compared to a chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the cost of the candy bar.

$7 - $3 = $4

So, Dan spent $4 more on buying a candy bar than he did on buying a chocolate."
"Response: 
To find out how much Dan spent buying chocolate compared to the amount he spent buying a candy bar, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the total amount Dan spent.
Total Amount Spent = Cost of Chocolate + Cost of Candy Bar
= $7 + $2
= $9
Therefore, Dan spent $9 in total.
He spent $7 on chocolate and $2 on a candy bar.
So, he spent $7 - $2 = $5 more on chocolate than on a candy bar."

Response: 46 books (the difference between 108 - 35 = 73).
Response: 91 (151 - 50 = 91)
Response: 42 books were sold by Paul because 58 - 42 = 16 is equal to the number of new books purchased (150).
"Response: 37 (calculation below)

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Paul initially had 21 books and sold x books at his garage sale. After selling those books, he is left with 15 books.

We know that Paul also bought 42 new books after the garage sale. So, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 42 = 15

Where x represents the number of books Paul sold at the garage sale.

To solve for x, subtract 42 from both sides of the equation:

x + 42 - 42 = 15 - 42

This simplifies to:

x = 37

So, Paul sold 37 books at his garage sale. He sold more books than he bought because he started with 21 books and ended with 15 books after buying 42 new books."

Solve for x by subtracting 106 from both sides of the equation:

x = 92

So Paul sold 92 pens at the garage sale."
Response: 136 - 27 = 109.
"Response:  Let's say Paul sold x books at the garage sale. We know that he started with 134 books and gave 39 books away as gifts. So, the number of books he has left is:  

134 - 39 = 95  
Now we are told that Paul has 68 books left, so we can set up an equation:  

95 - x = 68  
Solve for x by subtracting 95 from both sides:  

x = 27  
Therefore, Paul sold 27 books at the garage sale."
"Response:  Let's say Paul sold x books at the garage sale. We know that he started with 153 books and ended up with 13 books left. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  

153 - x = 13

Solve for x by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation:  

153 - 13 = x

Now solve for x:  

140 = x

So Paul sold 140 books at the garage sale."
"Response: 
Let's use ""P"" to represent the number of pens sold at the garage sale. We know that Paul started with 42 pens and has 19 pens left after the garage sale, so we can set up an equation as follows:

42 - P = 19

We also know that Paul sold some books at the garage sale, but we don't know how many. Let's use ""B"" to represent the number of books sold. We know that Paul started with 143 books and has 113 books left after the garage sale, so we can set up another equation as follows:

143 - B = 113

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (P and B). Can you solve for P and B?"
Response:  There will be 18 roses in the vase after Jessica added 8 more roses to the existing 10 roses.
Response: 7 roses were in the vase at the beginning.
Response:  Jessica cut $21$ roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
Response:  Jessica cut 17 - 3 = 14 more roses than she threw away.
Response: 34 - 15 = 19. Jessica threw away 19 more roses than she cut from her garden.
Response:  Jessica cut   = 59 - 20 = 39 roses.
Response: 12 roses are left in Jessica's flower garden.
Response:  Jessica cut 17 - 15 = 2 roses.
Response: 21 - 2 = 19 orchids did Jessica cut.
Response: 10 (roses) - 2 (orchids) = 8 more roses than orchids in the vase.
Response: 9 (the number of more orchids than roses)
"Response:  To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we need to subtract the initial number of roses (3) from the total number of roses currently in the vase (19). So,  

19 - 3 = 16

Therefore, Jessica cut 16 roses from her flower garden."
Response:  Jessica cut $14$ roses.
Response: 7 (orchids)
"Response:  There are 22 roses in the vase, and 21 orchids. To find out how many more roses than orchids, subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses:  

22 - 21 = 1

Therefore, there are one more rose than orchid in the vase."
"Response:  There are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.  
Explanation: Let's count the number of each type of flower in the vase after Jessica added more flowers:
Orchids: 13 (initial) + 9 = 22
Roses: 3 (initial) + 6 = 9
Therefore, there are 22 - 9 = 13 more orchids than roses in the vase now."
Response: 4 inches (17 - 13 = 4)
"Response: 
Before Robin cut her hair, it was 20 + 10 = 30 inches long."
Response:  Robin's hair is currently 23 inches long (16 + 12).
Response: 37 inches (19 + 18)
Response: 14 - 13 = 1 inch. Robin's hair is now 1 inch long.
"Response: 
Let's start with what we know:
Robin had 14 inches of hair to begin with.
She grew her hair by 8 inches.
So, after growing her hair, Robin has 14 + 8 = 22 inches of hair.
Then, she cut off 20 inches of her hair.
Therefore, Robin has 22 - 20 = 2 inches of hair left.
Her hair is now 2 inches long."

Response: 53 - 21 = 32. Danny found 32 bottle caps at the park.
Response: 51 + 63 = 114 bottle caps.
Response: 11 (Danny found 11 more bottle caps at the park than the number of old ones he threw away.)
Response: 63 - 30 = 33. Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park.
Response: 22
Response: 30 - 17 = 13 wrappers did Danny have at first.
"Response: 
Danny collected 30 bottle caps at the park and 14 wrappers. To determine how many more bottle caps Danny collected than wrappers, subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps:

30 - 14 = 16

Therefore, Danny collected 16 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park."
Response: 28 - 11 = 17 (wrappers) > 68 - 11 = 57 (bottle caps). So Danny found 17 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.
"Response: 
Danny has 28 - 16 = 12 more bottle caps than wrappers."
"Response: 
Danny has 43 wrappers - 27 bottle caps = 16 more wrappers than bottle caps."

Response: 6 (54 - 48 = 6)
"Response: 
Let's start by analyzing the information given to us:
Danny had 29 bottle caps at first, and he collected 42 more at the park. So, Danny currently has 29 + 42 = 71 bottle caps.
Now, let's look at the wrappers:
Danny had 82 wrappers at first, and he found 61 more at the park. Therefore, Danny currently has 82 + 61 = 143 wrappers.
So, to summarize, Danny had 29 bottle caps at first, and he currently has 71 bottle caps and 143 wrappers."
Response: 66 wrappers
Response: 39 (bottle caps) - 52 (wrappers) = 13 more bottle caps than wrappers.
Response: 9 - 3 = 6 more wrappers than bottle caps.
"Response: 
Danny has 12 bottle caps - 11 wrappers = 1 more bottle cap than wrapper."

Response: 18 (Steven has 18 peaches)
Response:  Jake has  7 - 14 = 7 - 14 = 7 + 14 = 21 peaches.
"Response:  Jill has 26 peaches (calculated below).  

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 18 peaches.
Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill. This means that if Jill has y peaches, then Steven has y + 13 peaches.
We know that Steven has 19 peaches. So we can set up two equations based on these statements:
Equation 1: Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven:
x - 18 = 19... (1)
Equation 2: Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill:
x + 13 = y + 13... (2)
Now solve Equation 1 for x:
Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
x + 13 = y + 13
x + 13 - 18 = y + 13 - 18
x - 18 = y - 18
Solving for x, we get:
x = 24
So Jake has 24 peaches. Now we can find out how many peaches Jill has:
Since Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 19 peaches, Jill must have 19 - 18 = 1 more peach than Jake. Therefore, Jill has 25 peaches."
"Response: 2
Explanation: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 8 - 3 = 5 peaches. Since Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, Jill has 8 - 3 = 5 peaches as well. Therefore, Jake has 5 - 5 = 0 more peaches than Jill."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Jill has 11 more peaches than Steven, so Jill has 11 + 4 = 15 peaches in total. Since Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 4 - 12 = 2 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 15 - 2 = 13 more peaches than Jake."
Response:  Jake has 7 + 9 = 16 peaches.
Response:  Jill has  9 (17 - 7 + 8) peaches.
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.
* Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches (since Jill cannot have negative number of peaches).
* Since Jill has no peaches, we can say that Steven has 16 + (-11) = 5 more peaches than Jill.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
Response:  Jake has 5 - 6 = 9 peaches.
"Response:  Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven and Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Let S be the number of peaches Steven has = 18 + J's number of peaches (Jill)
S = 18 + 87
S = 105

Now, let J be the number of peaches Jake has = S - 5
J = 105 - 5
J = 100

So, Jake has 100 peaches and Jill has 87 peaches. The difference between their numbers is:

Jake has 100 - 87 = 13 more peaches than Jill."
Response: 4 peaches.
Response:  Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has  19 - 12 = 7 peaches.
Response:  Jake has 13 + 3 = 16 apples.
Response: 9 more peaches than apples.
"Response: 
Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples, so he has a total of 12 + 15 = 27 fruit.
Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 3 = 9 peaches.
Jake also has 10 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 15 + 10 = 25 apples.
To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we need to compare the number of apples he has with the number of peaches he has:
27 (apples) - 25 (peaches) = 2
Therefore, Steven has 2 more apples than peaches."
"Response:  Jake has 8 peaches (calculation below).  

Let's break down the information given in the problem to find out how many peaches Jake has:

Steven has 12 peaches and Jill has 67 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jill has 12 - 67 = 55 peaches.
Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches.

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Steven has 18 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill.

From the first statement, we know that Steven has 18 peaches.
From the second statement, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 18 - 12 = 6 peaches.
From the third statement, we know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 6 + 8 = 14 peaches.

Therefore, Jill has 14 peaches."
"Response:  Jake has 53 peaches (calculation below).  

Let's break down the information given in the problem to find out how many peaches Jake has:

Steven has 19 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
Jill has 72 more peaches than Jake.

First, let's calculate how many peaches Jake has by subtracting 12 from Steven's number of peaches:

19 - 12 = 7

So, Jake has 7 peaches.

Now, we know that Jill has 72 more peaches than Jake, so we can add 72 to Jake's number of peaches to find out how many peaches Jill has:

7 + 72 = 80

Therefore, Jill has 80 peaches."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

Steven has 14 peaches.
Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 peaches.
Jill has 3 more peaches than Jake, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 peaches.
Therefore, Jill has 11 peaches."
Response:  Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has  13 - 10 = 3 peaches.
Response:  Jake has 13 + 8 =  21 apples.
Response: 7 more peaches than apples.
"Response: 
Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has a total of 19 + 15 = 34 fruit.
Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches.
Jake also has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples.
Therefore, Steven has 34 fruit in total (15 peaches and 19 apples), and Jake has 23 fruit in total (12 peaches and 23 apples).
To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we need to subtract the number of peaches from the number of apples:

23 (apples) - 15 (peaches) = 8

So, Steven has 8 more apples than peaches."
Response: 63 dollars (78 - 15 = 63)
"Response: 
Let's say that Olivia had x amount of dollars to begin with. Since she spent $78 and now has $33 left, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x - 78 = 33

To solve for x (the initial amount of money), we can add 78 to both sides of the equation:

x - 78 + 78 = 33 + 78

This simplifies to:

2x = 111

Dividing by 2 gives us:

x = 55

So, Olivia had $55 to begin with before spending $78 at the supermarket."
Response:  $159 - $100 = $59.
"Response:  Olivia collected $49 more dollars from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.  

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. There were $3 in Olivia's wallet initially.
2. She collected $49 more dollars from the ATM.
3. After visiting the supermarket, there were $49 dollars left in her wallet.

Now let's think about what happened to the money:

1. The initial $3 + the $49 collected from the ATM = Total amount of money Olivia had.
2. The total amount of money minus the amount spent at the supermarket = Amount left in her wallet.

Using these two equations, we can solve for the unknown variable (the amount spent at the supermarket):

Equation 1:
$3 + $49 = Total amount of money
Total amount of money = $3 + $49 = $52

Equation 2:
$52 - Amount spent at supermarket = Amount left in wallet
Amount spent at supermarket = $52 - $49 = $3

So, Olivia spent $3 at the supermarket and collected $49 more dollars from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket."
"Response:  $ 91 - $ 14 = $77
Explanation: To find out how much more Olivia spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we need to subtract the amount of money she had left ($14) from the amount of money she collected at the ATM ($91). This gives us $77 as the difference between the two amounts."
"Response:  $49 - $26 = $23
Explanation: The amount Olivia spent at the showroom is given as $49. Subtracting the amount she had remaining after visiting both places ($26), we get the amount she spent at the showroom: $49 - $26 = $23."
Response:  $54 - $29 = $25.  
"Response:  $128 - $38 = $90
Explanation: To find out how much money Olivia has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent ($38) from the initial amount of money she had ($128). The result is $90, which represents the amount of money Olivia has left after spending $38 at the supermarket."
Response: 14 (19 - 5 = 14)
Response: 18 + 5 = 23 apps were on Dave's phone at the beginning.
Response: 7 apps were deleted by Dave.
Response: 65 (89 - 24 = 65).
Response: 67 (71 - 4 = 67)
"Response: 
Let's say Dave deleted x apps. We know that before deleting any apps or files, Dave had 16 apps in total. After deleting some apps and files, Dave has 5 apps remaining. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  

16 - x = 5

Solving for x gives us:

x = 11

So Dave deleted 11 apps from his phone."
"Response: 
Let X be the number of files Dave deleted.
We know that after deleting some apps and files, Dave has 3 apps and 7 files left.
So we can write an equation based on this information:

3 + 7 = 21 (since there were originally 21 files)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 21 - 3 - 7
= 21 - 10
= 11

Therefore, Dave deleted 11 files."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know:

* Dave has 21 apps left on his phone (given)
* Dave has 4 files left on his phone (given)

We can start by finding out how many more apps Dave has compared to files. To do this, subtract the number of files from the number of apps:

21 - 4 = 17

So, Dave has 17 more apps than files on his phone."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know:
Dave has 6 apps left on his phone (given).
He has 15 files left on his phone (given).
We can let x be the number of apps Dave has left on his phone.
Then, we can write an equation to represent the information given in the problem:
x + 15 = 6...(1)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
x + 15 - 15 = 6 - 15
x = 0
So, there are no more apps left on Dave's phone. Now, we can find out how many more files than apps Dave has left on his phone:
15 - 0 = 15
Therefore, Dave has 15 more files than apps left on his phone."
Response: 1 app was added by Dave to his phone.
"Response: 
Let X be the number of apps Dave deleted.
We know that Dave started with 15 apps and deleted some of them, so we can write an equation based on this information:
15 - X = 12 (since Dave has 12 apps left)
Solving for X, we get:
X = 3 (Dave deleted 3 apps)"
"Response: 
Let's say Dave deleted x files.
We know that initially, Dave had 24 files and after deleting some files, he has 21 files left. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

24 - x = 21

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3

So Dave deleted 3 files."
"Response: 
Let's say Dave has x apps remaining on his phone. Since there are 12 apps in total, we know that x + 5 = 12 (since there are 5 files). Solving for x gives us:
x = 7
So, Dave has 7 apps left on his phone and 5 files. He has 2 more apps than files."
Response: 24 - 2 = 22. Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.
Response: 106 (cards that Nell has left)
"Response: 
Nell had 301 + 154 = 455 cards initially."
Response: 316 ( Nell gave 316 cards to Jeff)
"Response: 
Jeff has 234 + x = 234 + (some number of cards given by Nell) cards now, where x is the number of cards that Nell gave him.
We know that Nell has 566 - x = 566 - (number of cards given by Jeff) cards left after giving some cards to Jeff.
So we can set up two equations:
Equation 1: 234 + x = 234 + (some number of cards given by Nell)
Equation 2: 566 - x = 566 - (number of cards given by Jeff)
Now solve these equations simultaneously to find out the value of x and the number of cards that Jeff has."

Response: 87 (more 10-cards than baseball cards)
"Response:  Nell gave 195 cards to John and some more to Jeff, so she gave a total of 195 + x cards to Jeff, where x is the number of additional cards she gave to Jeff. Since Nell has 210 cards left, we can set up the equation:

195 + x = 210

Solving for x, we get:

x = 15

So, Nell gave 15 cards to Jeff in addition to the 195 cards she gave to John."
"Response: 
Nell has 178 baseball cards - 55 10-cards = 123 more baseball cards than 10 cards."
"Response:

Paco had 54 cookies at first (35 + 19 = 54)."
Response: 21 (28 - 7 = 21)
"Response: 
Paco had 40 cookies to start with and ate 2 of them, so he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left after eating 2 cookies. Then he bought 37 more cookies, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total."
"Response: 8 (the number of additional cookies Paco ate)

Explanation:
Paco started with 25 cookies and ate 5 of them, leaving him with 20 cookies. Then he bought 3 more cookies, bringing his total to 23 cookies. The difference between the number of cookies Paco ate and the number of cookies he bought is 8 (25 - 20 = 8)."
"Response: 
Paco ate 2 cookies and then bought 36 more cookies, so he bought 36 - 2 = 34 more cookies than the ones he ate."
Response: 22 cookies (40 - 5 + 13 = 22)
"Response: 
Paco ate 14 cookies and gave 13 cookies to his friend, so he ate 14 - 13 = 1 more cookie than he gave to his friend."
Response: 5 (21 - 16 = 5)
Response: 22 - 15 = 7 (Paco has 7 sweet cookies left)
Response: 3 (Paco has 3 salty cookies left)
"Response: 
Let's say Paco ate x sweet cookies and y salty cookies. We know that x + y = 37 (total number of cookies eaten) and x + 2 = 5 (number of sweet cookies eaten). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 30 and y = 7. Therefore, Paco ate 30 sweet cookies and 7 salty cookies. Since he ate more sweet cookies than salty cookies, the difference is:

Sweet cookies - Salty cookies = 30 - 7 = 23

So, Paco ate 23 more sweet cookies than salty cookies."
Response: 14 (salty cookies - sweet cookies) = 34 (salty cookies) - 20 (sweet cookies).
Response: 1 cookie.

Response:  Gwen received $14 dollars for her birthday because if she had $6 dollars left after spending $8 dollars then she must have had $14 dollars in total ($8 + $6 = $14).
Response: 5 dollars.
Response: 3 dollars. Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, so in total she received $8 + $5 = $13. She spent $4, so she received $13 - $4 = $9 more from her mom than from her dad.
Response: 2 dollars. Gwen's father gave her $6 - $4 = $2 more than her mother gave her.
Response: 3 dollars (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom, so in total she received $7. She spent $6, so she has $7 - $6 = $1 left over. Therefore, she received $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom.
Response: 5 marbles (since Josh had 9 marbles initially and currently has 4).
"Response: 
Josh had x marbles in his collection initially. He lost 21 marbles and is left with 12 marbles now. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation as follows:
x - 21 = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 33
Therefore, Josh had 33 marbles in his collection initially before losing 21 of them."
Response: 8 (19 - 11 + 5)
"Response: 8 - 16 = -8
Explanation: Josh lost 16 marbles and found 8 new ones, so he has 4 + 8 = 12 marbles left. He lost 16 - 8 = 8 more marbles than he found."

Response: 15 pounds (Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds more than his dad's).
Response: 22 pounds (dad's strawberries weighed more than Marco's by 22 pounds).
Response: 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3)
Response: 40 pounds (32 + 8)
"Response: 
Let's say Marco's father had x pounds of strawberries before they returned home. Since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, he has only 3 pounds left. Therefore, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Marco's strawberries = 3 pounds

Subtracting 9 pounds from Marco's total will give us the weight of his father's strawberries:

Marco's strawberries - 9 pounds = His Father's Strawberries

Solving for x, we get:

x = 24 pounds (since Marco and his father collected 24 pounds of strawberries in total)

Therefore, his father's strawberries weighed 24 pounds."
Response: 4 pounds (8 pounds - 3 pounds = 4 pounds)
Response: 30 pounds.
Response: 22 pounds (37 - 15 = 22)
"Response: 
Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so he picked 30 pounds of strawberries.
If together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds, then Marco's dad only picked 17 - 30 = 13 pounds of strawberries.
So, Marco's strawberries were 30 - 13 = 17 pounds more than his dad's."
"Response: 
His dad's strawberries weighed $26 - 10 = 16$ pounds more than Marco's strawberries."
"Response: 
Let's say Marco picked x pounds of strawberries. Since his father's strawberries weighed 11 pounds, then together they would have weighed 11 + x pounds. The total weight is given as 30 pounds, so we can set up an equation:

11 + x = 30

Solve for x by subtracting 11 from both sides:

x = 30 - 11

x = 19

So, Marco picked 19 pounds of strawberries."

Response: 26 + 38 = 64 children are on the bus now.
Response: 30 children were riding on the bus before it stopped.
"Response: 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
Explanation: If 43 children were initially on the bus and 21 children were left on the bus after some children got off, then 22 children (43 - 21) must have gotten off the bus at the bus stop."
Response: 23 (the difference between 41 and 18).
Response: 4 children got on the bus at the bus stop because 21 - 10 = 11 and 11 + 4 = 15 (the number of children who were initially on the bus).
Response: 79 - 63 = 16. So, 16 more children got on the bus than those who got off.
Response: 56 (the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on)
"Response: 18 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* At first, there were 22 children on the bus.
* When the bus stopped at the bus stop, 40 more children boarded the bus.
* After all these children got on and off the bus, there were only 2 children left on the bus.

Now let's think about what happened to the other 38 children who boarded the bus:

* If 22 children were already on the bus, that means 16 children (40 - 22 = 16) boarded the bus at the bus stop.
* But we know that only 2 children were left on the bus after everyone boarded and exited. Therefore, 16 children must have gotten off the bus at the bus stop.

So, 16 children got off the bus at the bus stop."
Response: 54 (the difference between the number of children who boarded and the total number of children on the bus).
"Response: 5 (let's explain)

Explanation: Let X be the number of children who got off the bus and Y be the number of children who got on the bus. We know that X + Y = 8 (total number of children on the bus). Since 23 children were already on the bus, we can set up the equation as follows:

X + Y = 8

We also know that 24 children got on the bus, so Y = 24. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

X + 24 = 8

Solving for X, we get:

X = 5

Therefore, 5 more children got off the bus than those who got on."

Response: 47 (the difference between the number of cakes sold and the number of new cakes purchased)
Response: 84 cakes.
"Response: 39 more cakes were made by the baker than those that were sold.
Explanation: To find out how many more cakes the baker made than those sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made. Let's do this:

Total number of cakes made = 144
Number of cakes sold = 71

Subtracting 71 from 144 gives us:

144 - 71 = 73

So, the baker made 73 more cakes than those sold."
Response: 39 (149 - 10 = 139)
Response: 45 (148 - 103 = 45)
"Response: 30 (cakes) + 48 (pastries) = 78.
The difference between the number of cakes and pastries is:
78 - 81 = -3."
Response: 49 (more pastries than cakes)
Response: 13 (cakes) - 10 (pastries) = 3.
"Response: 
Let's say x is the number of more pastries Baker sold than cakes.
We know that Baker sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries in total.
So we can write an equation to represent this information:

68 + 92 = 160... (1)

Now let's think about what we know about the relationship between cakes and pastries. We know that Baker made 54 cakes and 143 pastries. So for every one cake Baker made, they also made approximately 2.5 pastries (since there are 143/54 = 2.57 pastries per cake).

Therefore, if Baker sold 68 cakes, they must have sold approximately 68 x 2.5 = 160 pastries as well (since each cake comes with 2.5 pastries). This means that the difference between the number of pastries and cakes sold is exactly equal to 160 - 68 = 92 pastries!

So the correct answer is x = 92 pastries."
Response: 48 - 44 = 4.
Response: 40 - 8 = 32.
Response: 32 (169 - 137 = 32)
Response:  The baker has 87 cakes left (173 - 103 + 86).
Response: 78 (more cakes baker bought than those he sold)
"Response: 
Let X = number of cakes Baker baked (8)
Y = number of new cakes purchased by Baker (139)
Z = number of cakes sold by Baker (145)
To find out how many more cakes Baker sold than those he bought, we need to subtract the number of new cakes purchased from the number of cakes sold:
Z - Y = 145 - 139 = 6
Therefore, Baker sold 6 more cakes than those he bought."
Response: 82 cakes.
Response: 92 - 46 = 46.
"Response: 
Let's say the number of cakes the baker has after selling some is x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem as follows:

x + 167 = 108 + 44

Solve for x by subtracting 167 from both sides:

x + 167 - 167 = 108 + 44 - 167

x = 23

Therefore, the baker would still have 23 cakes after selling 108 cakes and 44 pastries."
Response: 27 (29 - 2 = 27)
Response: 84 - 94 = -10 or 10 fewer cakes than pastries.
Response: 92 - 140 = 48. The baker made 48 more pastries than cakes.
Response: 97 - 8 = 99 more cakes than pastries were sold by the baker.
"Response: 
Let's say the number of cakes Baker sold is x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem as follows:

x + 78 = 154 (since 154 pastries were sold)

Simplifying this equation by subtracting 78 from both sides gives us:

x + 0 = 76

Solving for x, we get:

x = 76 - 0

Therefore, Baker sold 76 cakes.

Now let's find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker sold:

To do this, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold (76) from the total number of pastries sold (154):

154 - 76 = 78

So Baker sold 78 more pastries than cakes."

1944 oranges (66 x 28 = 1944)"
Response: 3 days
Response: 14 sacks per day (56 / 4 = 14)
"Response: 
To find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 49 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks per day by the number of days they will be harvesting : 
38 sacks/day x 49 days =  1764 sacks "
"Response: 
To find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of oranges harvested in 87 days. 
Let's start by calculating the daily harvest : 
Daily Harvest = Number of Sacks x Number of Oranges per Sack 
Daily Harvest = 66 x 25 
Daily Harvest = 1650 
Now let's calculate the total number of oranges harvested in 87 days : 
Total Harvest = Daily Harvest x Number of Days 
Total Harvest = 1650 x 87 
Total Harvest = 143,950 
Therefore, after 87 days of harvest, they will have 143,950 oranges."
"Response: 
They harvest 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day."
"Response: 
To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we can divide 80 by the number of sacks harvested per day : 
80 / 16 = 5 days 
Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges."
"Response: 
To find out how many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges, we can use the information given in the problem :

* Each sack contains 12 oranges
* They harvest 67 sacks per day

So, to calculate the number of oranges harvested, we can multiply the number of sacks harvested by the number of oranges per sack :

Number of oranges = Number of sacks x Number of oranges per sack
= 35 x 12
= 420

Therefore, if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges, they will have harvested 420 oranges."
Response: 3 sacks of oranges will be left after 51 days of harvesting.
"Response: 
To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we need to calculate the number of sacks that contain good oranges. We can do this by subtracting the number of sacks discarded from the total number of sacks harvested.

Number of sacks harvested = 76
Number of sacks discarded = 64

Therefore, the number of sacks containing good oranges is:

76 - 64 = 12

Since each sack contains 50 oranges, the total number of good oranges harvested per day is:

12 x 50 = 600

So, they harvest 600 oranges per day."
"Response: 

Let X be the number of sacks of oranges harvested in one day. Then we can write an equation for the total number of sacks of oranges harvested in 26 days as follows:

X(28 + 52) = (28 x 26) + (52 x 26)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

342X = 792 + 1320

Solving for X, we get:

X = 24

Therefore, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have harvested a total of:

28 x 26 = 728 sacks of ripe oranges
52 x 26 = 1320 sacks of unripe oranges

Total = 728 + 1320 = 2048 sacks of oranges."
"Response: 

Let X be the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested in 25 days. Since each day they harvest 82 sacks of ripe oranges, we can write an equation for the total number of sacks of ripe oranges as follows:

X + 82(25) = 82(25) + 61(25)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

X + 2050 = 2050 + 1525

Solving for X, we find that:

X = 3575

Therefore, after 25 days of harvesting, they will have 3575 sacks of ripe oranges."
"Response: 

Let X be the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in 45 days.
Since they harvest 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day, the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in 45 days is:
X = 24 x 45 = 1080 sacks
Therefore, after 45 days of harvesting, they will have 1080 sacks of unripe oranges."
Response: 19 sacks (44 - 25 = 19)
Response: 69 (74 - 5) = 69 more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day than ripe oranges.
Response: 3 days (18 x 3 = 54)
Response: 56 x 14 = 784 sacks of oranges were harvested in total over 14 days.
"Response: 

Let X be the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested in 73 days.
Since they harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges per day, we can write an equation based on this information:
X = 5(73)

Solve for X by multiplying 5 by 73:
X = 5 x 73 = 365

Therefore, after 73 days of harvesting, they will have 365 sacks of ripe oranges."
"Response: 

Let X be the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in 6 days.
Since they harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges per day, we can write an equation as follows:
X = 65 x 6

Solve for X by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:

X = 65 x 6
X = 390

Therefore, after 6 days of harvesting, they will have 390 sacks of unripe oranges."
"Response: 86 - 41 = 45

"Response: 
The area of Jesse's carpet should be equal to 14 square feet. Since the length of Jesse's room is given as 7 feet, we can use this information to find out the width of the room. To do so, we need to divide the area of the carpet by the length of the room. We get:  
Width = Area / Length  Width = 14 ft^2 / 7 ft  Width = 2 ft or 24 inches  Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 24 inches or 2 feet."
"Response: 
The area of the carpet Jesse wants is given by:
Area = Length x Width
Given that the width of Jesse's room is 7 feet, we can substitute this value into the formula to solve for the length of the room:
Length = Area / Width
Substituting the values given in the problem:
Length = 14 ft^2 / 7 ft
Simplifying and solving for the length:
Length = 20 ft
Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 20 feet."
"Response: 249 square feet (calculation below)

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the total area of Jesse's room in square feet:

Length x Width = Total Area
Total Area = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet

Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, we subtract that from the total area to find out how much more carpet she needs:

More Carpet Needed = Total Area - Amount Already Have
More Carpet Needed = 165 - 16 = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 149 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room."
"Response: 
To find out how many tiles Jesse needs, we first need to calculate the total area of her room's floor. We can do this by multiplying its length (2 feet) by its width (12 feet):

Total Area = Length x Width
= 2 x 12
= 24 square feet

Since each tile has an area of 4 square feet, we divide the total area by the size of one tile to determine how many tiles are needed:

Number of Tiles = Total Area / Size of One Tile
= 24 / 4
= 6

Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the entire floor of her room."
"Response:  To calculate the total area of Jesse's rooms, we multiply the length by width of each room. Since there are 20 rooms, we repeat this calculation for each room and then add up the results.  
Total Area = (19 x 18) + (19 x 18) +... + (19 x 18)  Total Area = 324 square feet  Therefore, Jesse needs 324 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms."
Response: 20 - 19 = 1 foot. Her room is one foot longer than it is wide.
"Response: 
The area of the carpet that Jesse needs is given as 10 square feet. Since she wants to cover her entire room with this carpet, we know that the area of the room must be equal to the area of the carpet. The length of the room is given as 5 feet, so we can use this information to find the width of the room.

Let's start by converting both dimensions from feet to square feet:

Length (L) = 5 ft x 12 in/ft = 60 sq ft
Width (W) =?

Since the area of the room is equal to the area of the carpet, we can set up an equation using these two values:

Area of room (A) = Area of carpet (C)

A = C

We know that the area of the carpet is 10 square feet, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:

10 = C

Now we need to solve for the width of the room. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

W = 10 / 10

W = 1

So the width of Jesse's room is 1 foot."
"Response: 
Let's use Jesse's room dimensions to find out how long she needs for the carpet. We know that the width of her room is 2 feet and we need to find out its length so that we can calculate the area required for the carpet. 
Area = Length x Width 
Length = Area / Width  
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 
Length = (10) / (2) 
Length = 5 feet 
Therefore, Jesse needs a carpet with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room, which has a length of 5 feet and a width of 2 feet."
"Response:  Jesse needs an additional $36$ square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.

Explanation: To find out how much extra carpet Jesse needs, we first calculate the total area of her room by multiplying its length and width:

Total Area = Length x Width
= 4 x 20
= 80 square feet

Since Jesse already has $18$ square feet of carpet, we subtract that from the total area to determine how much more carpet she needs:

More Carpet Needed = Total Area - Amount Already Have
= 80 - 18
= 62 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional $62$ square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor."
"Response: 
Let's say x is the number of t-shirts that were sold. Since the Razorback T-Shirt Shop makes $23 per shirt, we can write an equation based on this information:  

23x = 230... (1)

Now, let's solve for x. We can divide both sides of the equation by 23 to get rid of the dollar sign:  

x = 230 / 23... (2)

Simplifying, we have:  

x = 9

So, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 9 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response: 
Let's say that the cost per t-shirt (C) = x.
We know that the total revenue (R) = 3 x C because there were three t-shirts sold for C dollars each.
The equation becomes:
R = 3x
R = 51
Solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:
x = R/3
x = 51/3
x = 17
So, the cost per t-shirt is $17."
"Response: 
To find out how much money was made by selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to know how many t-shirts were sold during that game. According to the problem, 47 t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. We can use this information to calculate how much revenue was generated from these sales using the given price per t-shirt ($87).

Revenue from Arkansas Game = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price Per T-Shirt
= 47 x $87
= $3,969

Response: 127 (the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game)
"Response: 
To find out how much money was made by selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold (89) by the price per t-shirt ($ 98). Therefore, the amount earned from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is:

89 x $ 98 = $ 8,722"
"Response: 

Let X be the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game. Since we know that the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $78 per shirt, we can set up an equation as follows:

X \* 78 = (186 - X) \* 78

We know that there were 186 t-shirts sold in total, so we can substitute this value into the first term of the equation:

X \* 78 + (186 - X) \* 78 = 78(186)

Simplifying the equation:

3X + 1404 = 1404

Solving for X:

3X = 1404

X = 468

So, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $78 \times 468 = $36,544 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game."

So, a jersey costs $146 more than a T-shirt."
"Response: 
The total amount made by the Razorback T-Shirt Shop from selling t-shirts is calculated as follows:
Total Amount = (Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt) - Discount Per T-Shirt
= (130 x $51) - ($8 x 130)
= $6,430 - $940
= $5,490
Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $5,490 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game after offering an $8 discount per t-shirt."
"Response: 
To find out how much money Razorback T-Shirt Shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned.

Let's assume that Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks (4 years) and pays $702 in taxes. To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings over the period.

Total Earnings = Weekly Earning x Number of Weeks
= $21 x 216
= $4560

Now, let's subtract the amount paid as taxes from the total earnings:

Balance After Taxes = Total Earnings - Taxes
= $4560 - $702
= $3858

Therefore, after paying $702 in taxes, Lewis will have $3858 left at the end of the harvest season."
"Response: 
To calculate the total amount Lewis will earn in 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks worked in each season : 
$ 1357 x 223 = $ 309,811 
Therefore, Lewis will earn $ 309,811 if he works for 73 harvest seasons."
"Response: 
To calculate Lewis's total income during the harvest season, we need to add his regular weekly earnings and his overtime weekly earnings.

Regular Weekly Earnings = $28 x 1091 weeks = $3,072.80
Overtime Weekly Earnings = $939 x 1091 weeks = $996,499
Total Income During Harvest Season = Regular Weekly Earnings + Overtime Weekly Earnings = $3,072.80 + $996,499 = $1,000,571.80"
"Response: 
Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks = Total amount earned during harvest season =  
$403 x 233 = $91,690"
"Response: 
To find out how much Lewis pays in rent throughout the harvest period, we must multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works during the harvest season.
Lewis makes $368 each week and works for 1359 weeks during the harvest season.
$368 x 1359 = $497,244 is the total amount that Lewis spends on rent over the course of the harvest season."
"Response: 
To calculate the amount of money Lewis will have after the harvest season, we need to subtract the total amount of rent paid from the total amount earned during the harvest period.
Total Amount Earned = Total Weeks x Weekly Earning
= 1181 weeks x $491/week
= $537,091

Total Rent Paid = Total Weeks x Weekly Rent
= 1181 weeks x $216/week
= $252,796

Amount Left After Paying Rent = Total Amount Earned - Total Rent Paid
= $537,091 - $252,796
= $284,295

Therefore, Lewis will have $284,295 left after paying rent at the end of the harvest season."
Response:  Lewis earns $7 per week.  
Response:  The harvest lasted for 90 weeks (178 / 2 = 90).

Response:  There will be 17 books in each of Bryan's two bookshelves since 34 is divided evenly among them.
"Response: 
If Bryan has a total of 42 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then he will need 42/2 = 21 bookshelves to store all of his books."
"Response: 
To find out how many books Bryan has in total, we need to multiply the number of bookshelves by the number of books per shelf. We can do this as follows:

Total books = Number of bookshelves x Number of books per shelf
= 23 x 27
= 541

Therefore, Bryan has 541 books in total."
"Response:  To find out how many magazines Bryan has in total, we need to multiply the number of bookshelves (10) by the number of magazines on each shelf (46):  
Total Magazines = Number of Bookshelves x Number of Magazines per Shelf  
Total Magazines = 10 x 46  
Total Magazines = 460  
Therefore, Bryan has 460 magazines in total."
"Response: 
To find out how many books Bryan has in total, we need to multiply the number of bookshelves by the number of books per shelf:

29 x 23 = 647

So, Bryan has 647 books.

To find out how many magazines Bryan has in total, we can do the same calculation:

29 x 61 = 1899

So, Bryan has 1899 magazines."
Response: 4 books per shelf.
Response:  Bryan has 19 bookshelves.
"Response: 
To ensure that no friend is left out, Carol needs to buy packages of invitations such that every friend receives an invitation. Since there are 10 friends and each package has 2 invitations, Carol needs to buy 10/2 = 5 packets of invitations."
"Response: 
There are 3 packs with the same number of invitations. Let x be the number of invitations in each pack. Since Carol has 12 friends and needs to send out invitations to all of them, we know that 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So there are 4 invitations in each pack."
"Response: 
Let X = number of invitations Carol has after sending some to her friends.
We know that Carol buys 7 packs of invitations, so she has 7 x 10 = 70 invitations in total.
If she sends invitations to 2 friends, then she uses up 2 x 10 = 20 invitations.
Therefore, X = 70 - 20 = 50."
Response:  Carol has 14 x 6 = 84 invitations in total (from the 6 packs). Plus, she has 11 extra invitations, so she has a total of 84 + 11 = 95 invitations.
"Response: 
To determine how many extra invitations Carol needs to buy, we can start by determining how many invitations are included in each pack that she purchased. Since each pack has three invitations, we know that:

2 packs x 3 invitations/pack = 6 invitations

Since Carol wants to invite 9 friends, we subtract the number of invitations she already has (6) from the total number of friends she wants to invite (9):

9 - 6 = 3

Therefore, Carol needs to buy 3 extra invitations."
Response:  Melissa played 3 games.  
Response:  Melissa scored 27 points in each game.  
"Response: 
To calculate Melissa's total points for 79 games, we need to multiply her average score per game by 79. Since she scores 109 points per game and gets 82 bonus points per game, her total points per game is:

Total Points Per Game = (109 + 82) = 191

Now, let's multiply her total points per game by 79:

Total Points For 79 Games = 191 x 79 = 14,399

Therefore, Melissa scored 14,399 points in 79 games."
"Response: 3 games
Explanation: Melissa scored a total of 21 points and she scored 7 points in each game, so we can calculate the number of games as follows:

21 = 7 x (number of games)

Solving for the number of games, we get:

3 games"
Response:  Melissa scored 7 points per game.  
"Response: 
Each seat of the Ferris wheel can accommodate 5 individuals (20/4 = 5)."
Response: 20 seats (18 riders x 9 people per rider)
"Response: 
To find out how many people can ride 20 Ferris wheels simultaneously, we need to calculate the total number of seats available across all 20 Ferris wheels. Since each Ferris wheel has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people, the total number of seats available is:

Total Seats = Number of Ferris Wheels x Number of Seats per Ferris Wheel
= 20 x 19
= 380

Now, we need to calculate the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheels at the same time. To do this, we divide the total number of seats by the number of people that can fit in each seat:

Maximum Riders = Total Seats / Number of People per Seat
= 380 / 15
= 25

Therefore, up to 25 people can ride the Ferris wheels in Paradise Park simultaneously if there are 20 Ferris wheels with 19 seats each."
Response: 96 people (18 x 15 = 96) - 10 (seats that are broken).
Response: 2 people can join the Ferris wheel because there are currently 16 people riding it and each car can accommodate up to 14 riders for a total of 6 x 14 = 84 available spaces.
Response: 2 x 14 = 28 people can ride the Ferris wheel on small seats.
Response: 7 x 12 = 84 people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats.
Response: 4 people can sit in each seat of the Ferris wheel.
Response:  The Ferris wheel has 8 seats because 2 x 4 = 8.

"Response: 
To find out how many seeds Paige and her mother planted, we need to multiply the number of flower beds by the number of seeds per flower bed. We know that there are 45 flower beds and 10 seeds in each flower bed, so we can calculate as follows:

45 x 10 = 450

Therefore, Paige and her mother planted 450 seeds."
Response: 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per flowerbed
Response: 4 flower beds.
Response: 90 flowers (55 x 2 = 110 - 60)
"Response: 
If Paige and her mother planted 60 seeds altogether and each flower bed requires 10 seeds, then they would have had 6 flower beds (60 / 10 = 6)."
Response: 4 seeds per flowerbed.
"Response: 
Let's say Matthew has x crackers in total. If he gives 2 crackers to each of his 11 friends, then he will give a total of 2 x 11 = 22 crackers away.
So, after giving away the crackers, Matthew will be left with x - 22 crackers.
Now, we need to find out what value of x results in x - 22 being equal to zero. To do this, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:
x - 22 = 0

Solving for x, we get:
x = 22

Therefore, Matthew had 22 crackers before giving any away."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Matthew gave 2 crackers to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 2 x 4 = 8 crackers to his friends. Therefore, he gave crackers to 4 friends."
Response: 2 crackers per friend (2 x 5 = 10).
Response: 8 (8 x 3 = 24)
"Response: 
Let's say Matthew gives an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend. So he will give 22/11 = 2 crackers and 34/11 = 3 cakes to each friend."
Response: 10 cakes per person (30 cakes divided by 3 people).
"Response: 
Let's say Matthew gives x crackers and y cakes to each friend. Since there are 7 friends, we can write an equation for the total number of crackers and cakes given to all friends as follows:

x + (x + 1) +... + (x + 6) = 14 (total crackers)
y + (y + 1) +... + (y + 6) = 21 (total cakes)

Since Matthew has 14 crackers and 21 cakes in total, we know that:

x + y = 14 + 21 = 35

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 3 crackers per friend
y = 5 cakes per friend

So each friend will eat 3 crackers and 5 cakes."
"Response: 36 / 18 = 2
Each friend ate 2 crackers."
"Response: 6 x 6 = 36
Therefore, Matthew gave crackers to 6 friends."
"Response: 
Let's say Matthew gave x crackers to each of his two friends. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem as follows:

x + x = 11 (since Matthew has 11 crackers left)

Simplifying the equation by adding x and x, we get:

2x = 11

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:

x = 5

So, each of Matthew's friends ate 5 crackers."
Response: 8 (Matthew gave 8 crackers to each of his 5 friends)
"Response: 
Let's assume that Matthew divided the crackers equally among his four friends. If there are x number of crackers per friend, then we can set up an equation as follows:

x + x + x + x = 32 (since there are 32 crackers in total)

Since all the values are equal, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4:

x = 8 (since there are 8 crackers per friend)

Now, let's find out how many cakes each friend got. We know that there are 98 cakes in total, so we can divide them equally among the four friends:

98 / 4 = 24 (since each friend gets 24 cakes)

Therefore, each friend ate 8 crackers and 24 cakes."
Response: 2 cakes per friend.
"Response: 
Let x be the number of crackers each friend received. Since there are 28 friends, we can write the equation:
x + (13/28) = 28
where (13/28) represents the fraction of crackers that Matthew has. Solving for x, we get:
x = 4
So each friend received 4 crackers.
Now let y be the number of cakes each friend received. We know that there are 15 cakes in total, so we can write the equation:
y + (15/28) = 28
Solving for y, we get:
y = 7
So each friend received 7 cakes."
"Response: 
Let's say Debby bought x bottles of water. Since each bottle contains 109 ml of water and she drinks 109 bottles per day, she consumes 109x ml of water per day.
Since there are 74 days in total, Debby consumed 74 x 109 = 8236 ml of water in total.
Therefore, to consume 8236 ml of water over 74 days, Debby must have purchased at least 8236/109 = 75 bottles of water."
"Response: 
Debby drank 153/17 = 9 bottles per day."
Response: 264 - (15 x 11) = 264 - 165 = 99 water bottles left.
"Response: 
Let's say Debby drank x days worth of water. Then we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Debby had 301 water bottles at first (let's call this ""A"") and she drank 144 bottles per day (let's call this ""B""). So after one day, she would have A - B = 301 - 144 = 157 bottles left.

We know that Debby has 157 bottles left, so we can set up another equation based on this information:

157 = A - (x \* B)... where x is the number of days Debby drank water.

Now we need to solve for x by substituting equations A and B into equation 2:

157 = 301 - (x \* 144)

Simplifying:

157 = 301 - x \* 144

Subtracting 301 from both sides gives us:

-144 = -x \* 144

Dividing both sides by -144 gives us:

x = 1

So Debby drank water for exactly 1 day!"
"Response: 22 days

Explanation:
To determine how many days the water bottles will last, we need to divide the number of water bottles by the number of water bottles consumed per day (in this case, 4). This gives us:

88 water bottles / 4 water bottles/day = 22 days

Therefore, the water bottles will last for 22 days if Debby drinks 4 water bottles per day."
"Response: 

Let's say Debby drinks x soda bottles per day. Then we can set up an equation to represent this information:

x + 4 = 256 (since there are 4 soda bottles left after Debby drinks one)

Now let's find out how long the soda bottles will last based on how much Debby drinks each day:

If Debby drinks 312 water bottles per day, then she drinks 312 - 4 = 308 soda bottles per day.

So, the soda bottles will last for:

256 / 308 = 0.827 days or approximately 2 days."
Response: 12 bottles / 6 bottles per day = 2 days
"Response: 

Let's say Debby drinks x water bottles per day. Then, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

x + 15 = 180 (since there are 180 water bottles in total)

Now, let's find out how long it will take for her to finish all the water bottles by solving for x:

x = 180 - 15

x = 165

So, Debby has enough water bottles to last for 165 days."
Response: 45 days.
"Response: 
Faye has 14 x 11 = 154 pencils."
Response: 4 pencils per row.
"Response: 
To find out how many rows Faye can make, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row. We have 28 packs of pencils, and each pack has 24 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

28 x 24 = 672

Faye wants to place the pencils in rows with 16 pencils in each row, so we divide the total number of pencils by 16:

672 / 16 = 41

Therefore, Faye can make 41 rows of pencils."
Response:  Faye has 22 x 6 = 132 pencils in total.
"Response: 
Faye has 35 pencils and wants to place them in rows of 5 pencils each. To find out how many rows she can make, we need to divide 35 by 5:

35 ÷ 5 = 7
So Faye can make 7 rows of 5 pencils each."
"Response: 
Faye has 4 x 19 = 76 pencils."
Response:  Faye has 30 x 7 = 210 crayons.
"Response: 
Faye has a total of 31 x 11 = 341 pencils and 27 x 11 = 297 crayons. Therefore, Faye has a total of 341 + 297 = 638 art supplies."
"Response: 
Faye can make 6 rows of 5 pencils each because 5 x 6 = 30 (the number of pencils Faye has)."
Response: 3 pencils in each row.
"Response: 
Faye has 35 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 4 pencils. To find out how many rows Faye can make, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row (in this case, 2).

So, we can calculate as follows:

Total number of pencils = 35 x 4 = 140
Number of pencils per row = 2

Therefore, we can make:

140 / 2 = 70 rows

So, Faye can make 70 rows of pencils."
Response: 31 x 6 = 186 pencils.
Response: 24 x 30 = 720 pencils.
Response:  Faye has 32 crayons (16 x 6 = 32).
"Response: 
There are 98 students in total at the school. If we divide that number by the number of buses (which is 7), we can determine how many students will be assigned to each bus. To do this, we'll use long division with remainders.

98 / 7 = 14 remainder 1

So, each bus will have 14 students (the quotient) plus one additional student (the remainder). Therefore, each bus will seat 15 students."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The school has 84 classrooms.
* Each school bus can seat 118 students.
* There are 95 school buses.

We need to find out how many students are in the school. To do this, we will use the information about the number of classrooms and the number of school buses. We know that there are 84 classrooms and 95 school buses, so let's start by multiplying these two numbers together to get the total number of student desks:

84 x 95 = 7960

Now, we know that each school bus can seat 118 students, so let's divide the total number of student desks by the number of students per bus to find out how many buses are needed:

7960 / 118 = 67

Since there are 95 school buses, we can see that there are not enough buses to transport all of the students. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of students in the school based on the information provided."
"Response: 
To determine the number of buses required for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available per bus. We can do this as follows:
Total Number of Students = 67 x 66 = 4322
Number of Seats Available Per Bus = 6
Therefore, we can calculate the number of buses required as follows:
4322 / 6 = 720
So, we would need 720 buses to transport all the students on the field trip."
"Response: 
To determine the number of buses required for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus (in this case, 2 seats per bus). We can calculate this as follows:

Total number of students = 58 x Number of classrooms = 58 x 87 = 4966

Number of buses required = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus
= 4966 / 2
= 2483

Therefore, 2483 buses will be needed for the field trip."
"Response: 
Let's say that x represents the number of students per class. Since there are 24 classrooms and 120 students total, we can write an equation to represent this information as follows:

24x = 120

To find out how many students are in each class, we divide both sides by 24:

x = 120/24

x = 5

Therefore, there are five students in each class."
Response: 3 buses will be required to transport all of the students who wish to participate in the field trip.
"Response: 
Let X be the number of students who don't want to go on the trip = 8
The total number of students in the school = 11 (given)
Total number of seats available on each bus = 99 (given)
Number of students who will go on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students not going = 11 - 8 = 3
Therefore, 3 students are going on the trip."
"Response: 
To determine the number of buses needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus. In this case, we have 111 students and 3 seats per bus, so we can calculate as follows:

111 students / 3 seats per bus = 37 buses

Therefore, the school needs 37 buses to take the field trip."
"Response: 
Let's assume that each bus can seat x number of students. Since there are 46 buses and 92 students, we can set up the following equation:

x \* 46 = 92

Solving for x, we get:

x = 92 / 46

x = 2

Therefore, each bus can seat 2 students."

If Haley has 20 marbles and there are 2 boys who like to play with her, then each boy will receive 10 marbles since division is done equally among the two boys."
Response: 14 boys.
"Response: 
To find out how many days Frank took to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day : 
392 pages / 14 pages/day = 28 days 
Therefore, it will take Frank 28 days to finish the book."
"Response: 
Let's say the total number of pages in the book is x.
Frank reads 22 pages per day, so he reads a total of 22x pages over 569 days.
We can set up an equation based on this information:
22x = 569 \* 22
Solving for x, we get:
x = 13044
Therefore, there are 13044 pages in Frank's favorite book."
Response:  To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book. So, we can calculate as follows: Total pages = 612 pages Number of chapters = 24 chapters Days taken to finish the book = 6 days Therefore, we can calculate the average number of pages Frank read per day as follows: Average pages per day = Total pages / Days taken to finish the book Average pages per day = 612 pages / 6 days Average pages per day = 102 pages per day
"Response: 
Let's say there are x pages in each chapter. Since there are 5 chapters and 555 pages total, we can set up the equation:
x + x + x + x + x = 555
where x is the number of pages in each chapter.

Since Frank took 220 days to read the entire book, we know that he spent d days reading each chapter:
d = 220 / 5
d = 44 days per chapter

Now we can use this information to solve for x:
x + x + x + x + x = 555
x + x + x + x + x = 555 - 44(5)
x + x + x + x + x = 511

The sum of the first five positive integers is 511:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 511

So, there are 511 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 
Let's say Frank finished x chapters each day. Since there are 15 chapters in total and Frank took 660 days to complete the book, we can set up an equation as follows:

x \* 15 = 660

Solving for x, we get:

x = 44

Therefore, Frank read 44 chapters every day."
"Response: 
To find out how many pages Frank reads per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it takes him to finish the book. In this case, there are 249 pages in each book, and it takes Frank 3 days to finish each book, so:

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
= 249 pages / 3 days
= 83 pages per day"
"Response: 
Let's say Frank reads x books in total. Since each book has 66 pages, Frank will have read a total of 66x pages.
Since it takes him 12 days to complete one book, it will take him 12x days to complete all the books.
We know that Frank spends 492 days to finish all the books, so we can set up an equation as follows:

12x = 492

Now divide both sides by 12 to solve for x:

x = 492 / 12

x = 38

Therefore, Frank reads 38 books in total."
"Response: 
To find out how many pages Frank read each day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book:

Total pages = 112 pages
Days taken to finish the book = 16 days

So, we can calculate the average number of pages Frank read per day as follows:

Average pages per day = Total pages / Days taken to finish the book
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read an average of 7 pages per day."
Response: 576 / 8 = 72 days
Response:  To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took him to finish the book. So, we can calculate as follows: Total pages = 41 x 450 = 18,950 pages Number of days = 30 days Therefore, pages per day = Total pages / Number of days = 18,950 / 30 = 631 pages/day
"Response: 
To find out how many pages there are in each chapter, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters. We know that the book has 3 chapters and 594 pages in total (594 x 3 = 1782). To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we can divide 1782 by 3:

1782 ÷ 3 = 594

So, there are 594 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 
Let's say Frank reads x chapters per day. Since there are two chapters in total and each chapter has 405 pages, then Frank reads 405x pages per day.
We know that it takes him 664 days to complete the entire book, so we can set up an equation as follows:

405x = 664 \* 365 (days)

where 365 is the number of days in a year. Solving for x gives us:

x = 187.5

So, Frank reads approximately 187.5 chapters per day."
"Response: 
To find out how much each pack costs, we need to divide the total amount by the number of packs:

$120 / 6 = $20 per pack

So, each pack of DVDs costs $20."
"Response: 
To calculate the total cost of buying 33 packs of DVDs, we need to multiply the cost per pack by 33:

Cost per pack = $81
Total cost of 33 packs = 33 x $81 = $2,693

Therefore, it would cost $2,693 to buy 33 packs of DVDs at $81 per pack."
Response: 2 packs of DVDs.
"Response: 
To find out how much we need to pay for each pack after a discount of $25, we can subtract $25 from the original price of $76.

"Response: 
Brenda's mother prepared 420 cookies (14 x 30)."
"Response: 
Let's say Brenda and her mother together received x cookies. Since Brenda's mother threw away 17 cookies, then Brenda must have received (x - 17) cookies.
Since both Brenda and her mother received the same number of cookies, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Brenda received (x - 17) cookies
Brenda's mother received (x - 17) cookies

Adding these two equations gives us:

2(x - 17) = 22

Solving for x, we get:

x = 39

So, Brenda and her mother together received 39 cookies."
"Response: 
Let X be the number of guests who came to the party. Then we know that X + 9 = 10 (since 9 guests did not come).
We also know that Brenda's mother prepared 18 cookies in total. Therefore, the number of cookies prepared per guest is 18/X.
Since each guest had the same number of cookies, we can set up an equation based on this information:
18/X = 18/10 = 1.8
Now, we need to find out what value of X satisfies both equations. To do this, we can divide both sides of the second equation by 1.8:
X = 10 x 1.8 = 18
Therefore, there were 18 guests at the party. Each guest received 18/18 = 1 cookie."
Response: 7 cookies per guest.
Response: 5 guests.

If Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoils and needs to deliver 5 cases (cases = 12 boxes), then we can calculate the number of boxes in each case as follows:

Number of boxes in one case = Total number of boxes / Number of cases
= 10 boxes / 5 cases
= 2 boxes per case

Therefore, there are 2 boxes in each case."

"Response: 959 visitors (calculation below)

Explanation:
To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace in 25 days, we need to divide the total number of visitors in one day by 25.

Total number of visitors in one day = 703

Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors in one day / Number of days
= 703 / 25
= 28

Therefore, 28 x 25 = 700 visitors visited Buckingham Palace within 25 days.

However, the question states that 246 visitors visited the palace on one particular day, so we need to subtract this number from the total number of visitors to get the correct answer.

703 - 246 = 457

Therefore, 457 visitors visited Buckingham Palace within 25 days."
Response: 594 (594 = 666 - 72)
"Response: 
Let's say x represents the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace the previous day.
We know that 132 visitors visited the palace on the day Rachel and her friends went (which is not today).
The total number of visitors in the last 327 days was 406.
To find out how many visitors were at the palace the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the total number of visitors over the past 327 days:
x = 406 - 132
x = 274
Therefore, approximately 274 visitors visited Buckingham Palace the previous day."
Response: 45 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that particular day.
"Response: 71 x 2 = 142 (total number of paintings)
142 / 188 = 0.76 (number of days for 188 visitors)
0.76 x 57 = 43 (days for 57 days)"
Response: 661 - 600 = 61.
"Response: 567 visitors (calculation below)

Explanation:
To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace before that day, we need to subtract the number of visitors who came on the previous two days from the total number of visitors on those days.

Total visitors on the previous day = 419
Total visitors on the day before that = 103

Subtracting the total visitors on the previous two days from each other gives us:

419 - 103 = 316

Therefore, 316 visitors visited Buckingham Palace before that day."
"Response: 
To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days, we need to add up all of the numbers given for each day. Let's do this step by step:

Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2: 808 visitors
Day 3 (today): 512 visitors
Total number of visitors so far = 471 + 808 + 512 = 1881

Since there have been 89 days, we can multiply the total number of visitors by 89/3 to get the average daily attendance:

Average daily attendance = 1881 x 89/3 = 621

Therefore, 621 visitors visited Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days."
Response: 284 more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on this particular day compared to the average number of visitors over the past 245 days (705 - 457 = 284).

x = 288 - 260

x = 28

Therefore, John already has 28 grams of wax."
"Response: 
Let x be the number of grams of wax that the boy has.
We know that he needs 22 g more than what he currently has. So we can write an equation as follows:
x + 22 = 353
Simplifying the equation:
x + 22 = 353
Subtracting 22 from both sides:
x = 331
Therefore, the boy has 331 grams of wax."

Therefore, 18 drums of grapes would be filled in each day."
Response: 38,504 drums of grapes (244 drums/day x 146 days)
"Response:  To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of drums filled per day (221) by the number of days (77). So,  

221 x 77 = 16987 drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days"
"Response: 
To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days, we need to multiply the number of drums filled per day (108) by the number of days (58). Therefore, the total number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 58 days is:

108 x 58 = 6,240 drums

So, in 58 days, 6,240 drums of grapes would be filled if each picker fills 108 drums per day."

"Response: 
Jackie has 9 - 8 = 1 apple less than Adam. Therefore, Jackie has 12 - 1 = 11 apples."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about Adam and Jackie's apple collection based on the information given in the problem statement:

Jackie has 10 apples.
Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie.
Together, they have 2 apples.
We can use this information to create an equation that represents their combined total of apples:

Let J represent Jackie's number of apples (J = 10)
Let A represent Adam's number of apples (A = J + 4)
Their combined total is 2, so we can set up the following equation:

J + A = 2...(1)
Now, let's solve for A using the value of J:

Substituting J = 10 into equation (1), we get:

A = 10 + 4 = 14
So, Adam has 14 apples."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about Adam and Jackie's fruit collections:

Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples.
Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie.

We can represent this information in an equation:

Let A be the number of apples Jackie has (which is 11).
Let B be the number of apples Adam has (which is 5 more than A).

So, B = A + 5...(1)

Now, let's substitute the value of A into equation (1):

B = 11 + 5

"Response: 
Let's compare the number of chocolate chip cookies to the number of raisin cookies that Helen baked.
Yesterday, Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies and 0 raisin cookies (since she didn't bake any). So, the difference is:

19 - 0 = 19

This means that Helen baked 19 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies yesterday.

Today, Helen baked 237 chocolate chip cookies and 231 raisin cookies. So, the difference is:

237 - 231 = 6

This means that Helen baked 6 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies today.

In total, Helen baked 19 + 6 = 25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies."
"Response: 
Let's compare the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday with the number she baked today.
Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies.
To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the number she baked today from the number she baked yesterday.
197 - 66 = 131
So, Helen baked 131 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday than she did today."
"Response: 
To find out how many more raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the number of raisin cookies she baked today from the number of raisin cookies she baked yesterday. Let's do that:

Yesterday: 280 - 300 = -20 (negative 20)
Today: 300 + 280 = 580

So, Helen baked 580 - (-20) = 580 + 20 = 600 more raisin cookies today than she did yesterday."

Response: 31 snakes were not hiding.
Response: 57 alligators were not hiding (97 - 40 = 57).
Response: 64 alligators were not hiding.
Response: 25 animals were not hiding in the cage because there are only 24 snakes and 51 alligators that were hiding. To find out how many animals were not hiding, subtract the total number of animals hiding from the total number of animals in the cage: 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 animals not hiding in the cage.
Response: 11 tomatoes.
Response: 63 tomatoes were left after yesterday's picking.
Response: 204 (154 + 50)
Response: 3 tomatoes and 5 potatoes are left after picking 172 potatoes.
"Response: 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes.
Explanation: If the farmer has 177 tomatoes and picks 53 of them, then he is left with 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes. Since there is no change in the number of potatoes (12), the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left."
"Response: 
Let X be the number of green tomatoes that the farmer has after picking 137 tomatoes. Then we can write an equation based on the information given:
X + 71 = 105... (1)
We know that the total number of tomatoes the farmer picked is 137, so we can set up another equation:
137 = X + 71... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
X + 71 = 137
Subtracting 71 from both sides gives us:
X = 66
So there are 66 green tomatoes left after the farmer picked 137 tomatoes."
"Response: 
To determine how many planks John needs for the house wall, we can start by determining how many nails are needed per plank. Since each plank requires two nails, we can say that one plank requires two nails.

Now, let's look at the total number of nails required for the entire wall. The question states that John will use four nails in all to secure the large planks of wood. So, the total number of nails required is:

Total number of nails = 4

Since each nail secures two planks, we can divide the total number of nails by 2 to find out how many planks are required:

Number of planks = Total number of nails / 2
= 4 / 2
= 2

Therefore, John needs 2 planks of wood for the house wall."
Response:  John will require 204 nails (13 x 17 = 221 + 8) to build the walls of his house.
Response:  To determine how many planks John needs for the house wall, we can start by identifying that each plank requires three nails to secure it. Therefore, the total number of nails required is 3 x 11 = 33 nails. Since 8 additional nails are used, this means that there must be at least 8 / 3 = 2 extra planks. So, John needs 2 + 11 = 13 planks for the house wall.
Response:  John needs 15 + 5 = 20 nails in total to secure the walls of his house.
Response: 32 nails (2 x 16)
Response:  John will need 8 x 74 = 592 planks of wood for the walls of his house.
"Response: 
To determine the total number of planks needed for the house wall, we first calculate the total number of large planks required using the formula:
Total Number of Large Planks = (Number of Walls x Length of Each Wall) / Size of Each Large Plank
Since there are 4 walls in the house, and each wall is 8 meters long, the calculation becomes:
Total Number of Large Planks = (4 x 8) / 3.6
= 32 / 3.6
= 9
Therefore, John will require 9 large planks for the house walls.
Now, let's calculate the total number of small planks required using the formula:
Total Number of Small Planks = Total Number of Large Planks x Ratio of Small Planks per Large Plank
In this case, the ratio of small planks per large plank is 25/14 = 1.75
So, the calculation becomes:
Total Number of Small Planks = 9 x 1.75
= 16.25
Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us:
Total Number of Small Planks = 17
Therefore, John will require 17 small planks for the house walls."
"Response: 
Let's use ""p"" to represent the number of packages Robin has. Since each package contains three pieces of gum, we can write an equation based on this information:

3p = 42 (since there are 3 x p = 42 pieces of gum)

Now divide both sides by 3 to solve for p:

p = 14 (Since 3p divided by 3 equals 14)

Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum."
"Response: 
Robin has 43 packages x 23 pieces per package = 961 pieces of gum.
Adding the 8 extra pieces gives Robin a total of 961 + 8 = 969 pieces of gum."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know:

* Robin has 7 pieces of gum per package (given)
* Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum (given)
* The total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41 (given)

Now let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many packages Robin has:

We know that each package contains 7 pieces of gum, so if we divide the total number of pieces of gum by 7, we should get the number of packages:

41 / 7 =?

Do you see how to solve for the number of packages?"
"Response: 
Robin has 28 packages of gum x 4 pieces per package = 112 pieces of gum."
"Response: 
To find out how many pieces of candy Robin has, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of pieces per package. We can do this as follows:

Number of packages x Number of pieces per package = Total number of pieces

In this case, we know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and 45 packages of candy. Each package of gum contains 9 pieces, so:

21 packages x 9 pieces/package = 189 pieces of gum

Each package of candy contains 9 pieces, so:

45 packages x 9 pieces/package = 405 pieces of candy

Therefore, Robin has a total of 189 + 405 = 694 pieces of candy."
"Response: 
Robin has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gum and 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy for a total of  168 + 84 = 252 pieces."

"Response: 
To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we can divide the total amount earned ( $165) by the number of days it was open (5):
$165 / 5 = $33 per day
So, the ring toss game made $33 per day."
"Response: 
The amount of money made by the ring toss game is calculated as follows:

Total daily income = $144 x 22 days = $3,068

Therefore, the total amount of money made by the ring toss game over the 22-day period is $3,068."
"Response: 
The Ring Toss Game Made $14 Per Day.

Explanation:
Let X be the daily earnings of the ring toss game. Since the game made the same amount of money each day, we know that X is constant. The total earnings for all 30 days are given as:

420 = 30X

We also know that the game and the attendant earned $22 together. So, the earnings of the game alone can be found by subtracting the amount earned by the attendant from the total earnings:

30X - 22 = 420

Solving for X, we get:

X = 14

Therefore, the ring toss game made $14 per day."
"Response: 
To find out how much money was made in total, we need to add up both amounts:

$382 + $374 = $756

Therefore, the ring toss game made a total of $756 over the entire period."
"Response: 
To find out how much the ring toss game made per day during the first 20 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total amount earned by the number of days it was open. In this case, the total amount earned is $120 + $66 = $186. The game was open for 20 days, so we can calculate as follows:

$186 / 20 days = $9.30 per day (for the first 20 days)"
"Response: 
To find out how much the ring toss game made per day during the last 57 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total amount earned during that period by the number of days.

Total amount earned = $114 (from the last 57 days) + $325 (from the first 154 days) = $439
Number of days = 57 + 154 = 211

Therefore, the daily earnings for the ring toss game during the last 57 days of the carnival were:

$439 / 211 = $2.06 per day"
Response: 6 (10 - 4 = 6)
Response: 4 + 22 + 16 = 42
Response: 4 packs of cake.
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Lucy spent $x on cookie packs (since there are 2 packs)
* Lucy spent $y on cake packs (since there are 12 packs)
* Lucy received $56 in change

We can write an equation based on this information:

$x + $y = Total Amount Spent
Total Amount Spent = Change Received

Substituting the values we know into the first equation, we get:

$x + $y = $56

Now solve for x and y:

$x + $y = $56

$x = 30 (since y = 56 - 30 = 26)$

So Lucy spent $30 on cookie packs and $26 on cake packs. In total, she spent $30 + $26 = $56."
Response:  There will be 12 + 4 = 16 people on the bus after four more people get on it. Since each bus cannot carry more than 36 people, we need to subtract 16 from 36 to find out how many people are currently on the bus. Therefore, there are 36 - 16 = 20 people on the bus right now.
Response:  There will be 9 (8 + 1) people on the bus after 12 more people get on it if no one gets off. If three people get off, then there will be 9 - 3 = 6 people left on the bus.

"Response: 
To find out how many action figures Adam's shelves can hold, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf. We know that Adam can fit 11 action figures on each shelf, so if he has four shelves, he can hold 4 x 11 = 44 action figures on his shelves."
Response: 2 shelves.
"Response: 
To find out how many items Adam's shelves can hold, we need to multiply the number of items he can place on each shelf by the number of shelves he has. We know that he can fit 8 action figures and 10 cabinets on each shelf, so if we multiply those numbers together, we get:
