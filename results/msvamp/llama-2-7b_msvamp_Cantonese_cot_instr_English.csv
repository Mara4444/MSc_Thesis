Response:  On Monday, Zhu Li played with 18 small roads. On Tuesday, he played with 10 more small roads than on Monday. So, the number of small roads Zhu Li played with on Tuesday is: 18 + (10 - 1) = 29. Therefore, there are 29 small roads that Zhu Li played with on Tuesday compared to Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Zhu Li and her friends played together for 11 hours. On Tuesday, she played with them for 12 hours more than they played on Monday. So, in total, Zhu Li played with her friends for 11 + (12 - 11) = 13 hours. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  On Monday, Zhu Li played with five other small roads. If he played with another ten small roads on Tuesday, how many small roads did he play with in total?  Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  On Monday, she played with 16 other roads and had fun playing netball together. So if she plays with another 16 roads on Tuesday, how many roads will she play with in total?  Therefore, the answer is 32 roads.
Response:  If Zhu Li starred in 16 episodes of fine roads with her friends on Monday, and she also starred in other 12 episodes of fine roads with her friends on Tuesday, then we can conclude that she starred in a total of 28 episodes of fine roads with her friends (16 + 12 = 28). Therefore, the answer is 28.
Response:  On Monday (week 1), Zhu Li played with 8 other people in small alleys. If he played more than 8 people in small alleys on Monday, how many did he play with? So, the answer is 9.
Response:  On Monday (weekday), Zhu Li played with 17 groups of people. On Tuesday (weekday), she played with 15 groups of people. On Wednesday (weekday), she played with 2 groups of people. Therefore, in total, Zhu Li played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 groups of people.
Response:  On Monday, there are 15 narrow roads to play.  On Tuesday, there are 28 narrow roads to play.  On Wednesday, there are 97 narrow roads to play. So, in total, there are 15 + 28 + 97 = 130 narrow roads to play together on both Mondays and Tuesdays.
Response:  On Monday and Thursday, they played 5 and 15 roads respectively. So, in total, they played 5 + 15 = 20 roads together.
Response:  On Monday and Wednesday, Zhu Li played with two people each time. Therefore, there are 2 x 2 = 4 pairs of Zhu Li playing together.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Zhu Li played with 16 and 10 people respectively. So, there are 16 + 10 = 26 pairs of Zhu Li playing together on these days. Since Zhu Li played with both groups on Saturday, we need to add the number of pairs from Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday: 4 + 26 = 30 pairs in total.
Response:  On Monday, Zhu Li played with 9 roads. On Tuesday, she played with 7 roads. On Wednesday, she played with 96 roads. So, we can see that Zhu Li played with more roads on Wednesday than on Monday and Tuesday combined. Therefore, the difference between the number of roads Zhu Li played with on Wednesday and the sum of the number of roads she played with on Monday and Tuesday is 96 - (9 + 7) = 82 roads.
Response:  On Monday, they played 14 routes together. On Tuesday, they played 2 routes together. On Wednesday, they played 8 routes together. So in total, they played 14 + 2 + 8 = 24 routes together. Therefore, the number of routes they played together is more than 3 times the number of routes they played separately (3 x 8 = 24).
Response:  On Monday (week 1), Zhu Li and her friends played together for 8 hours. On Tuesday (week 2), they played for 11 hours. On Wednesday (week 3), they played for 9 hours. To compare the total time spent playing, we need to add up all the hours played in each week. So, the total time spent playing for Week 1 = 8 hours + 8 hours = 16 hours. The total time spent playing for Week 2 = 11 hours + 11 hours = 22 hours. The total time spent playing for Week 3 = 9 hours + 9 hours = 18 hours. Therefore, the total time spent playing for Week 2 is greater than the total time spent playing for Week 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 朱莉 (Zhū Lì) has played with 15 people in Week 1 and 28 people in Week 2. Therefore, the total number of people Zhū Lì has played with is: 15 + 28 = 43 people.  Now, let's consider how many people Zhū Lì has played with each week. In Week 1, she played with 7 people, and in Week 2, she played with 28 people. So, the average number of people Zhū Lì has played with per week is: (7 + 28) / 2 = 21 people.  Finally, to determine whether Week 1 or Week 2 has more people playing with Zhū Lì, we need to compare the total number of people she played with in each week. As mentioned earlier, Zhū Lì played with 43 people in Week 2 and 21 people in Week 1. Therefore, Week 2 has more people playing with Zhū Lì than Week 1. The correct answer is: Yes, Week 2 has more people playing with Zhū Lì than Week 1.
Response:  On Monday (weekday), Zhu Li played with 13 paths. On Tuesday (weekday), he played with 20 paths. On Wednesday (weekday), he played with 15 paths. Therefore, the total number of paths that Zhu Li played is: 13 + 20 + 15 = 48 paths.
Response:  On Monday (week 1), Zhu Li played with 7 paths.  On Tuesday (week 2), she played with 13 paths.  On Wednesday (week 3), she played with 20 paths. So, in total, Zhu Li played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 paths.
Response:  On Monday, she played with 12 friends for 3 hours and spent $34 in total.  On Tuesday, she played with 14 friends for 2 days (not 1 hour) and spent $68 in total. So, the number of friends she played with at once is: $34 / 3 = 11 friends per day $68 / 2 = 34 friends per day Therefore, she played with an average of 11 + 34 = 45 friends at once.
Response:  On Monday, Zhu Li played tennis with 19 other people for 38 hours.  On Tuesday, she played with her friends (including herself) for 18 hours. So, in total, Zhu Li spent more time playing tennis with her friends on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference is: 38 - 18 = 20 hours. Therefore, Zhu Li spent 20 hours more playing tennis with her friends on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  On Tuesday, Zhu Li played with five other people in a small game of ""Hide and Seek"". On Wednesday, he played with six other people in a more intense version of the same game, where they had to knock on doors. So, we can assume that each player had to play with fewer players than before. Therefore, the number of players Zhu Li played with on Wednesday is greater than the number of players he played with on Tuesday. However, without further information, we cannot determine exactly how much greater."
Response:  On Monday, she played with four other alleys. So, there are five alleys in total ( herself + 4 others).  On Tuesday, she played with more than four alleys. So, there are at least five alleys in total (herself + 4 or more others). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  On Monday, Zhu Li played with four small roads.  On Tuesday, she played with six small roads.  On Wednesday, she played with twenty-seven small roads.  Therefore, the number of small roads that Zhu Li played with on Monday is fewer than the number of small roads she played with on Wednesday. So, the answer is (Wednesday) - (Monday).
Response:  At first, Bobby ate 43 sugar cubes. Then he ate additional 25 sugar cubes after that. So, in total, Bobby ate 68 sugar cubes (43 + 25).
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy and then ate another 42 pieces after that. So far, he has eaten a total of 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. Finally, he ate an additional 63 pieces of candy, bringing his total to 70 + 63 = 133 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby has eaten a total of 133 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then ate four more pieces of candy after that. So, in total, Bobby ate 37 pieces of candy (33 + 4). Now, let's compare this to how much chocolate Bobby ate. He ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is worth twice as much as a piece of candy, Bobby ate a total of 28 pieces of candy equivalent value (14 x 2 = 28). Therefore, the ratio of candy to chocolate eaten by Bobby is 37:28 or 1.35:1.
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and then ate another 36 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 74 pieces of candy (38 + 36 = 74). Then, he also ate 16 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of candies that Bobby has eaten is 74 + 16 = 90 pieces.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 20 pieces of candy. Then he ate another 34 pieces of candy. So far, Bobby has eaten a total of 54 pieces of candy (20 + 34 = 54). Later, he ate 18 more pieces of candy. Therefore, the final number of pieces of candy that Bobby ate is 72 (54 + 18 = 72).
Response:  First, Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces of candy. So, he now has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy in total. Therefore, Bobby has 25 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some of them, but we don't know how many exactly. So let's assume he ate half of them, which is 11 pieces (half of 22). After that, he ate five more pieces, so now he has 6 pieces left (22 - 11 - 5 = 6). Therefore, there are 6 pieces of candy left after Bobby finished eating all the candies.
Response:  Bobby has 19 pieces of candy and he eats two pieces. So, how many pieces of candy does Bobby have left?  We can count the number of pieces of candy that Bobby has left as follows:  Number of pieces of candy that Bobby has = Total number of pieces of candy - Number of pieces of candy that Bobby ate.  In this case, the total number of pieces of candy is 19, and Bobby ate 2 pieces, so the number of pieces of candy that Bobby has left is:  Number of pieces of candy that Bobby has = 19 - 2 = 17. Therefore, Bobby has 17 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats one piece, then he will have 31 pieces left. Now, if he eats another piece, he will have 30 pieces left. Continuing this process, we can see that for every piece of candy he eats, he will have 30 fewer pieces than before. Therefore, if he eats x pieces of candy, he will have 30x fewer pieces than when he started with 32 pieces. So, the number of pieces of candy Bobby will have left after eating x pieces is 30x.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 pieces of candy. He ate 17 pieces, leaving him with 19 pieces. Later, he ate another 15 pieces, bringing his total to 34 pieces. So, Bobby has 34 - 17 = 17 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby has 30 pieces of candy initially and he eats 23 pieces, then he has 7 remaining pieces of candy (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Allan has five balloons and Jake has three balloons. So, in total, Allan has 5 + 3 = 8 balloons at the park. Therefore, Allan has more balloons than Jake at the park.
Response:  Allen has two balloons, and Jake has three balloons. So, in total, Jake has 3 - 2 = 1 more balloon than Allen. Therefore, Jake has 1 + 2 = 3 more balloons than Allen at the park.
Response:  According to the question, Allan brought three balloons to the park, Jake brought two balloons, and Ellen brought five balloons. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  Three + Two + Five = Eleven  Therefore, Jack brought eleven balloons to the park.
Response:  If Jake has 6 balloons and he gives 4 to Alan, then Jake has 6 - 4 = 2 balloons left.  Now, if Alan has x balloons, then we know that Jake gave him 4 balloons, so Alan has x + 4 = 10 balloons in total (including the ones he already had).
Response:  If Alan has 5 balloons and Jake has 6 more than Alan, then Jake has 6 + 5 = 11 balloons in total. Therefore, Jake brings 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Firstly, Allan has three balloons and Jake has five balloons. So together they have 3 + 5 = 8 balloons at the park. Then, Allan buys two more balloons, so he now has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Finally, both Allan and Jake are playing with their respective numbers of balloons at the park, which is 8 + 5 = 13 balloons in total. Therefore, the number of balloons that Allan and Jake are playing with at the park is 13.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has two balloons and Jake has four balloons initially. So, in total, they have 2 + 4 = 6 balloons.  Afterwards, Allan buys three more balloons at the park, so he now has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons.  Therefore, the difference between Allan and Jake is 5 - 6 = -1 balloon.  Hence, Allan has fewer balloons than Jake in the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan brought two balloons to the park and then he bought three more balloons at the park. So, in total, Allan has five balloons (2 + 3 = 5). Now, let's consider Jake. We know that Jake brought six balloons to the park initially. Therefore, Jake has six balloons. Comparing both, we can see that Jake has more balloons than Allan (6 > 5). So, the correct answer is: Jake has more balloons than Allan.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons Allan had after buying them is: 4 + 3 = 7 balloons. So, Allan brought 7 balloons to the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has six balloons and Jake has two balloons. After they go to the park together, Allan buys three more balloons, so now he has nine balloons in total (six + three = nine). On the other hand, Jake still has only two balloons. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons Allan has and Jake has is nine - two = seven balloons. So, Allan has seven more balloons than Jake at the park.
Response:  Firstly, Allen brought six balloons to the park. Then, Jake brought three balloons to the park after that. Finally, both of them bought four more balloons at the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons Jake has is six (the initial amount he brought) + three (the additional ones he bought) = nine. On the other hand, Allen initially had six balloons and then bought four more, so his final balance is six + four = ten. So, Jake has nine balloons in total, while Allen has ten balloons.
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought 5 balloons to the park. Then, Jake brought 6 more balloons to the park after that. Finally, Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. Therefore, Jake brought a total of 9 balloons (6 + 3) to the park.
Response:  Allan has 3 balls and 20 balls in total, so he has 23 balls at the park.  Jake has 5 balls and 59 balls in total, so he has 54 balls at the park.  Therefore, Allan has more balls than Jake at the park, which is 23 - 54 = -31 balls.
Response:  Allan has 7 balls and 5 friends, so he has 7 x 5 = 35 balls in total. Similarly, Jake has 6 balls and 4 friends, so he has 6 x 4 = 24 balls in total. Therefore, there are 35 - 24 = 11 more balls with Allan than with Jake at the park.
Response:  According to the question, Allen has five balloons and Elmer has six balloons. If they both go to the park together, then Jack will have how many balloons at the park?  We know that Jack is going to the park with both Allen and Elmer, so he will have a total of 5 + 6 = 11 balloons at the park. Therefore, Jack will have 11 balloons at the park.
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more balloons. Therefore, Allan brought a total of five balloons (2 + 3) to the park.  Now, let's consider Jake's situation. He brought six balloons to the park. So, compared to Allan, Jake brought one additional balloon (6 - 5 = 1) to the park.  Hence, the difference between the number of balloons brought by Jake and Allan is one balloon.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 2 hours learning Chinese every day. So in total, he spends 6 + 2 = 8 hours studying languages per day.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day and 7 hours learning Chinese. To calculate how many hours he uses to learn Chinese, we need to divide the total time spent learning Chinese (7 hours) by the number of days he learns Chinese per week (5 days). So, Ryan uses approximately 1.4 hours (7 hours / 5 days = 1.4 hours) to learn Chinese each day.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and also studies Chinese for another 3 hours, then he spends a total of 6 hours per day on language learning (3 + 3 = 6).  Now, if he increases his time spent on English to 4 hours per day, that means he has an extra hour available to spend on other subjects or activities. So, he can allocate this additional hour to studying Chinese, which would bring his daily study time for Chinese to 9 hours (4 + 5 = 9).
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and has an additional 2 hours to study Chinese, then he studies Chinese for (7 - 2) = 5 hours less than he studies English. So, if Ryan studies English for x hours per day, he studies Chinese for 5x - 2 hours per day.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and additional time studying English. If he studies English for more than 2 hours than Chinese, then his total study time for English is... (insert answer)
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 7 hours learning Chinese every day, in total he will spend 6 x 5 = 30 hours learning English and 7 x 5 = 35 hours learning Chinese over 5 days. Therefore, Ryan will spend 30 + 35 = 65 hours learning both languages combined over 5 days.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day and 5 hours learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of 6 x 24 = 144 hours learning English in one week.  Since there are 7 days in a week, Ryan will spend 144 hours / 7 = 20 hours per day learning English.
Response:  If Ryan spends five hours learning English every day and four hours learning Chinese, it means he spends a total of nine hours (5 + 4) studying languages per day.  Now, if he wants to learn Chinese for six days, he will spend a total of 54 hours (9 x 6) learning Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese, then in total he spends:

English: 4 hours/day x 30 days = 120 hours
Chinese: 6 hours/day x 30 days = 180 hours
Total time spent studying both languages: 120 + 180 = 300 hours
Therefore, if Ryan wants to spend 86 days studying both English and Chinese, he will need to allocate his study time as follows:

English: 300 / 86 = 3.5 hours/day (approximately)
Chinese: 300 / 86 = 3.5 hours/day (approximately)
So, Ryan will need to spend approximately 3.5 hours per day studying English and Chinese for 86 days to reach the target of 86 days."
Response:  Every day, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English, 7 hours studying Chinese, and 3 hours studying Spanish. So in total, he spends 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours studying languages every day.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 3 hours per day learning Chinese, and 58 hours per week learning Spanish. To calculate how many hours he spends on each language in one day, we can divide the total time spent on that language by the number of days in a week (7). So, for English: 6/7 = 0.86 hours per day; for Chinese: 3/7 = 0.43 hours per day; and for Spanish: 58/7 = 8.29 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends approximately 0.86 hours per day learning English, 0.43 hours per day learning Chinese, and 8.29 hours per day learning Spanish."
Response:  Every day, Ryan spends 7 hours studying English, 2 hours studying Chinese, and 4 hours studying Spanish. To calculate how many hours he spends studying each language per day, we can divide the total study time for that language by the number of days in a week (7). For example, to calculate how many hours Ryan studies English per day, we would divide 7 hours by 7 days = 1 hour/day. Similarly, to calculate how many hours he studies Spanish per day, we would divide 4 hours by 7 days = 0.57 hours/day. So, Ryan uses approximately 1 hour per day to study English and around 0.57 hours per day to study Spanish.
Response:  Every day, Ryan spends 2 hours learning English, 5 hours learning Chinese, and 4 hours learning Spanish. So in total, he spends 7 hours (2 + 5 + 4) studying languages every day.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English every day and he spends 2 hours learning Chinese each day, then we can calculate how many hours he spends learning Chinese per day as follows:

Ryan learns English for 3 hours/day = 3 x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes/day
Since Ryan learns Chinese for 2 hours/day, he learns Chinese for (180 minutes/day - 2 hours/day) = 160 minutes/day
Therefore, Ryan learns Chinese for 160 minutes per day."
Response:  Ryan spends four hours studying English every day and five hours studying Chinese. If he studies both languages simultaneously for seven days, how many total hours will he spend on them in that time period?  Total hours = (4 x 7) + (5 x 7) = 28 + 35 = 63 hours. Therefore, Ryan will spend approximately 63 hours studying both English and Chinese over the course of one week.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected eight trash cans and stored them in her room.  On Tuesday, she found seven more trash cans that were not there on Monday. So, the total number of trash cans Tiffany collected and stored in her room is: 8 + 7 = 15 trash cans.
Response:  On Monday (Week 1), Tiffany collected 7 trash cans.  On Tuesday (Week 2), she found more than 7 trash cans. So, the difference between Week 2 and Week 1 is: 7 - 7 = 0. Therefore, there were no additional trash cans found in Week 2 compared to Week 1.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected four trash bags. If she collected six more trash bags on Tuesday, how many trash bags did she collect in total? So, the answer is 10 (4 + 6).
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 3 trash cans. If she collected 4 more trash cans on the second day, how many trash cans did she collect in total? Therefore, the answer is 8 trash cans (3 + 4 = 7).
Response:  On Monday, she collected ten plastic bags. Then on Tuesday, she found three more plastic bags. So, in total, there are ten + three = thirteen plastic bags.
Response:  On Monday, he collected 8 bags of trash.  On the second day, he collected 10 more bags, so now he has 18 bags in total (8 + 10).  Then, on the third day, he collected 4 more bags, bringing the total number of bags to 22 (18 + 4).  Therefore, after Monday, he had collected 22 bags of trash.
Response:  On Monday, there were three trash cans collected. If each can held 30 bags of trash (as stated in the problem), then the total number of bags collected on Monday was: 3 x 30 = 90 bags.  Now, let's consider the second day. The problem states that Tiffany found 7 more trash cans with bags of trash inside them. So, the total number of trash cans collected on the second day was: 90 + 7 = 97 trash cans.  Finally, we are asked to find out how many heads of trash were inside all the trash cans collected over the two days. Since each bag of trash contains 44 bottles or cans, and there were 97 trash cans collected, the total number of heads of trash collected over the two days is: 97 x 44 = 4288 heads of trash.
Response:  We have 17 red cherries and 16 green cherries inside the box. To find out how many more red cherries there are than green cherries, we need to count the number of red cherries first. There are 17 red cherries in total. So, if we subtract 16 from 17, we get 1. Therefore, there are 1 more red cherry than green cherries inside the box.
Response:  If there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in total, then inside the basket, there will be more green apples than red apples. So, the ratio of green apples to red apples is 11:5 or 2:1. Therefore, for every one red apple, there will be two green apples.
Response:  If there are 10 red cherries and 3 green ones in each of the 10 boxes, then the total number of red cherries is 10 x 3 = 30, and the total number of green cherries is 3 x 10 = 30. So, if one box has 15 cherries, it must have 15 / 30 = 5 green cherries. Therefore, one box contains 5 green cherries.
"Response:  If there are three red cherries and some green cherries in a bowl, and each red cherry has ten green cherries more than it, then we can conclude that... (1 mark)

Answer explanation:
Let R be the number of red cherries and G be the number of green cherries. Since there are three red cherries, R = 3. And since each red cherry has ten green cherries more than it, the number of green cherries associated with each red cherry is 10R = 30. Therefore, the total number of green cherries is G = 30 + 3 = 33. (2 marks)"
Response:  We have 7 red cherries, 15 yellow cherries, and 8 green cherries in total. So, we can write this as: 7 + 15 + 8 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 cherries in total.
"Response:  If there are 7 red cherries, 71 yellow cherries, and 8 green cherries in total, then the number of green cherries is:

Green cherries = Total number of cherries - Number of red cherries
= 71 - 7
= 64

Therefore, there are 64 green cherries in the basket."
Response:  There are 2 red balls, 6 yellow balls, and 14 green balls in total. Since there are more than twice as many green balls as yellow balls (14 : 6 = 2), there must be at least 28 green balls in the basket. Therefore, there are more than 28 green balls in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red cherries and 11 yellow cherries in total. Now, we need to find out how many more red cherries than yellow cherries there are. So, let's count the number of red cherries and divide it by the number of yellow cherries: Number of red cherries = 19  Number of yellow cherries = 11  Therefore, there are 8 more red cherries than yellow cherries (19 - 11 = 8).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 red dates, 90 yellow dates, and 16 green dates in total. Now, let's count the number of red dates among the green dates. There is only one red date among the green dates, so the answer is 1. Therefore, there are 1 red date among the green dates.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red balls and 14 yellow balls in total. Since they are all put into the same bucket, we can assume that each ball has an equal chance of being picked from the bucket. So, the probability of picking a red ball is also 1/3, since there are 18 red balls out of a total of 32 balls (18 + 14). Therefore, the number of red balls that will be picked is:  Number of red balls = Total number of balls x Probability of picking a red ball  Number of red balls = 32 x (1/3) = 12 So, there will be 12 red balls picked.
Response:  We have 5 red cherries, 14 yellow cherries, and 6 green cherries in total. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of green and yellow cherries there are. Since each green cherry can pair with only one yellow cherry, the number of pairs is equal to the number of yellow cherries minus the number of green cherries. Therefore, the number of pairs of green and yellow cherries is: 14 - 6 = 8 pairs. So, there are 8 pairs of green and yellow cherries inside.
Response:  We have 65 balls in total, and each ball has either 7 red or 3 green seeds inside. So, we can say that there are 65 x 7 = 455 red seeds and 65 x 3 = 195 green seeds in total. Therefore, the number of seeds is 455 + 195 = 650.
"Response:  We have 11 boxes of raisins. Each box has 10 red raisins and 18 green raisins. Therefore, we have a total of:

11 boxes x 10 red raisins/box = 110 red raisins
11 boxes x 18 green raisins/box = 198 green raisins
Total number of raisins = 110 + 198 = 308 raisins
Therefore, there are 308 raisins in total."
Response:  We have six baskets of fruit in total. Each basket has 16 red cherries and 18 green apples. So, the total number of red cherries is 6 x 16 = 96. And the total number of green apples is 6 x 18 = 108. Therefore, there are 96 + 108 = 204 fruits in total.
"Response:  We have seven groups of apricots, each with ten red apricots and two green apricots. Therefore, we have:
7 x 10 = 70 red apricots
70 - 2 = 68 green apricots
So there are 68 green apricots in total."
Response:  We have 12 dots in total (4 red and 3 green). Since each dot can be either red or green, we have 12! = 60 possible combinations. So, there are 60 ways to arrange the dots.
Response:  We have two boxes of mangoes, each with four red mangoes and one green mango. Therefore, we have a total of 8 mangoes (4 x 2 = 8). Since there are 12 mangoes in total, the number of green mangoes must be 4 (12 - 8 = 4). So, there are 4 green mangoes in the two boxes.
Response:  Since there are 16 balls in total, and 13 of them are red, we have 16 - 13 = 3 green balls. Therefore, there are 3 green balls in the basket.
"Response:  Since each orange has 19 red ones and 4 green ones, there are in total:

$$ \frac{19}{2} = 9 $$ orange pieces with red ones and:

$$ \frac{4}{2} = 2 $$ orange pieces with green ones. $$ Therefore, there are $ 9 + 2 = 11 $ orange pieces in total. $$ So, the number of orange pieces is $ 11 $."
Response:  Since there are ten balls in total, we can divide them into two groups of five each. Now, let's assume that four of the red balls and six of the green balls are placed at the edges of the container. So, the remaining one ball is left inside the container. Therefore, the number of red balls = 4, and the number of green balls = 6 + 1 = 7.  Hence, there are seven red balls and three green balls outside the container.
Response:  If there are six green cherries and sixty yellow cherries in total, then the ratio of green to yellow cherries is 6:60 or 1:10.  Therefore, if we put two red cherries inside, the number of green cherries will still be 6, but the number of yellow cherries will increase to 66 (6 x 11). So, the number of green cherries compared to yellow cherries after putting the red cherries inside will be 6/66 = 1/11.
Response:  If Jerry has four action figures on his bookshelf initially and then adds other characters to the shelf, we can calculate the total number of action figures as follows:  Initially, Jerry had four action figures, so there are 4 action figures in total.  When he adds more characters to the shelf, let's assume that each new character is an additional 2 action figures (just for simplicity). So, after adding 8 new characters, the total number of action figures would be: 4 + 2 x 8 = 32 action figures. Therefore, Jerry has 32 action figures on his bookshelf in total.
Response:  If Jerry initially had 7 action figures displayed on his shelf and then added another 7 action figures to make it 14 in total, how many action figures did he have at first?  Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had four action figures on the shelf before he added six more. So, initially there were 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on the shelf. After that, Jerry added another six action figures, making the total number of action figures on the shelf to 10 + 6 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 action figures on the shelf in total.
Response:  If Jerry has five action figures and puts them all on the bookshelf, then there are 5 action figures in total on the bookshelf initially. After he adds another 7 action figures, there will be a total of 12 action figures on the bookshelf (5 + 7 = 12). So, the number of action figures exceeding the number of books is 12 - 9 = 3.
Response:  Jerry has two animatronic dolls and ten books on his bookshelf. He then adds four more animated characters to the shelf. How many books are there on the bookshelf in total?  Based on the information provided, there are 14 books on Jerry's bookshelf (2 + 10 + 4 = 16).
Response:  Firstly, there are eight action figures and nine books on the shelf initially. Then, after adding ten more books to the shelf, there will be a total of nineteen books on the shelf (8 + 9 + 10 = 17). Therefore, the number of books on the shelf is 17.
Response:  Jerry has seven action figures from two books placed on his bookshelf. After that, he will place four more books with their respective action figure characters on the bookshelf. So, in total, there are 7 + 4 = 11 action figures displayed on the bookshelf.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry has five action figures placed on one bookshelf. Then he adds nine more books to the shelf, making it a total of 14 books. Now, there are more books than action figures on the shelf. So, the correct answer is: More than 5 (action figures) = More than 14 (books).
Response:  Firstly, Jerry placed eight action figures on the shelf. Then he added four more action figures to the shelf, making it a total of twelve action figures on the shelf. Finally, he moved five old toys away from the shelf, leaving only seven action figures on the shelf. Therefore, there are seven action figures on the shelf after Jerry moved the old toys away.
Response:  Firstly, there were three toy figures placed on the shelf initially. Then, four new characters were added to the shelf, and the old ones were removed. So, after these changes, there are six action figures on the shelf in total. Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response:  Firstly, there were seven action figures displayed on the shelf initially. Then, Jerry added more action figures to the shelf, making it eight in total. Finally, ten old action figures were taken away from the shelf. So, if we add up all these steps, the number of action figures on the shelf after each addition and subtraction is as follows: Initially, there were 7 action figures; then, Jerry added 8 more, so there were 15 (7 + 8) action figures on the shelf; next, 10 old action figures were removed, leaving 5 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the final answer is 5."
Response:  At first, Jerry put three action figures on the shelf (7). Then he added two more to the shelf (9). So, initially, Jerry had 12 action figures on the shelf.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry has nine action figures placed on the bookshelf. Then, he adds seven more action figures to the shelf, making it ten in total. So, there are ten books on the bookshelf, and each book can hold one action figure. Therefore, the number of action figures displayed is 10 x 9 = 90.
Response:  Firstly, there are three books and four animation models placed on the bookshelf initially. Then, two more animation models are added to the shelf, making it five in total. So, the number of animation characters displayed on the bookshelf after adding the new ones is 5.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry has seven books and three animation drawings in his room. Then he adds two more animations to the bookshelf, making it eight books and five drawings in total. So, there are 8 x 7 = 56 books and 3 x 5 = 15 drawings in Jerry's room. Therefore, the answer is 56 + 15 = 71.
Response:  initially there are two sparrows sitting on top.  If more birds join them, then the total number of birds on top will be 2 + (number of new birds joining). So if 4 more birds join, then the total number of birds on top is 2 + 4 = 6. Therefore, 6 birdies will come to sit on top.
Response:  At first, there were 4 birds (including the sparrow). Then, 3 more birds joined them, making it 7 in total. So, initially, there were 4 birds on top.
Response:  We have four birds and forty-six chairs in total. If we add six sparrows to the team, there will be a total of 46 + 6 = 52 birds sitting on the chairs. So, there are 52 birdies sitting on the chairs.
Response:  We have three birds sitting on top of each other and five more birds joining their team. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds sitting on the perch.
Response:  There are three birds sitting and four flying birds in total. When two more flying birds join the team, there will be five flying birds in total (three original + two new). So, the number of birdies is now: Three birds sitting + Five flying birds = Eight birds in total. Therefore, the answer is eight.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on top and six birds flying in the sky. Then three more birds fly into the group, making it seven total birds in the air. So, there are more birds in the air than on top, which is 7 - 2 = 5 more birds.
Response:  We have four birds and six chairs initially. When two eagles join in, there are now eight birds (four original + two new). So, the total number of birds sitting on the chairs is 8.
Response:  We have three birds and four chairs initially. Then six hawks join in. So, total number of birds = 3 + 6 = 9. Now, how many birds are sitting on the perch? Total number of birds = Number of birds sitting on perch = 9 / 2 = 4.5. Since we can't have a fraction of bird sitting on the perch, the final answer is 4 birds sitting on the perch.
Response:  We have six birds sitting on top of three chairs. Then two eagles join them. So, in total we have... (6 x 3) + 2 = 18 birds. Therefore, there are more bird than chairs.
Response:  We have four birds sitting on top of each other (4). Then six eagles join them (6 + 4 = 10). So there are ten birds in total.
Response:  We have six sparrows sitting on top of a fence post initially. Then four more sparrows join them, making it ten sparrows in total. Next, eight hawks arrive and start circling around the fence post. So now we have eighteen birds (ten sparrows + eight hawks) present at the location. Therefore, there are eighteen sparrows sitting on the fence post.
Response:  There are two sparrows sitting on top.  Then, five sparrows join a team with four hawks. How many more sparrows than hawks are there in total?  We can see that there are 7 sparrows (2 + 5) and 4 hawks. So, the answer is 3 (the number of sparrows exceeding hawks).
Response:  There are three sparrows sitting on top. Then, two more sparrows join them, making it five sparrows in total. Next, six hawks arrive and start attacking the sparrows. So, there are now 11 birds (5 sparrows + 6 hawks) on top. Therefore, the number of sparrows is 3, and the number of hawks is 6, so the ratio of sparrows to hawks is 3:6 or 1:2.
Response:  We have five birds sitting on three branches (5 x 3 = 15). Then four flying birds join them (4 + 0 = 4). So, in total we have 15 + 4 = 19 birds. Therefore, there are more than nine birds (9 + 4 = 13) in this situation.
Response:  We have six birds sitting on top of each other (6). Then three more flying birds join the team (3), making a total of nine birds (9). So, there are more birds above than below (9 > 6). Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  There are three sparrows sitting on top initially. Then six hawks join them and take two of the sparrows away to form their team. So, how many sparrows are left? We can count the number of sparrows that were not taken away as follows: Initially, there are three sparrows. Then, six hawks join them, but they only take two sparrows away, leaving us with one sparrow remaining. Therefore, the final answer is 3 + (6 x 2) = 10 sparrows.
Response:  First chapter length is given as 48 pages. Second chapter length is given as 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can subtract the lengths of the two chapters: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. So, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  First chapter is 37 pages long, and second chapter is 80 pages long. So, we can calculate the difference between them as follows: Chapter 2 length - Chapter 1 length = 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, the second chapter is 43 pages longer than the first chapter.
Response:  Since the first chapter is 60 pages long and there are 93 pages in total, we can calculate the number of pages for the second chapter as follows: Number of pages for the second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages of the first chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 33 pages.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in total, and Chapter 2 is 36 pages long, we can say that Chapter 1 has x pages.  Therefore, the number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages.
Response:  Since there are three chapters in the book, each chapter has a certain number of pages.  Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter.  So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Pages = Chapter 1 Page Count + Chapter 2 Page Count + Chapter 3 Page Count Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total Number of Pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.  Therefore, the book contains 125 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 91 + 23 + 25 = 149 pages. Now, let's compare the length of the first chapter to the second chapter. The first chapter has 91 pages, and the second chapter has 23 pages. Therefore, the difference between the two chapters is: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter is longer than the second chapter by 68 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in total. So, the total number of pages is equal to the sum of the pages of each chapter. Therefore, the total number of pages = 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 pages. Now, we need to find out how many pages are in the second chapter compared to the third chapter. We can do this by subtracting the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. So, the difference between the number of pages in the second and third chapters = 18 - 3 = 15 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 1 + 75 + 21 = 106 pages. Now, let's compare the length of each chapter: Chapter 1 has 53 pages, Chapter 2 has 75 pages, and Chapter 3 has 21 pages. So, we can say that Chapter 1 is longer than Chapter 3 by 53 - 21 = 32 pages. Therefore, the answer to the question is 32 pages.
Response:  Since there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter is 61 pages long, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Length of Each Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages
Response:  Since there are two chapters in total and each chapter has pages, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Chapter 1: 10 pages x = 10 pages Chapter 2: 13 pages - 10 pages = 3 pages Therefore, Chapter 1 has 10 pages, and Chapter 2 has 3 pages.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 81 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in Chapter 2 as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 2 = Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in Chapter 1 Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 81 (from the problem statement) Total number of pages in the book = 2 x 81 = 162 Therefore, the number of pages in Chapter 2 is: 68 pages / 81 pages per chapter = 0.84 or approximately 84 pages. So, there are approximately 84 pages in Chapter 2 of the book.
Response:  We know that there are 62 campers in total and they leave at dawn. Therefore, the number of campers who go to sea after lunch is:  Number of campers who go to sea = Total number of campers - Number of campers who left at dawn  = 62 - 39 = 23 So, there are 23 campers who stay behind and sleep in during the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that there are 52 campers in total and they leave at 6:00 AM. Therefore, the number of campers who go out to sea after lunch is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of campers who go out to sea after lunch = Number of campers who don't go out to sea before lunch - Number of campers who leave at 6:00 AM}} $$

We can simplify this equation as follows:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of campers who go out to sea after lunch = 61 - 52}} $$

So, there are 9 people who go out to sea after lunch."
"Response:  If there are 15 tents in the morning and 32 people go out for a boat ride, then we can assume that each tent has an average of 2 people (since there are 15 tents). Therefore, the number of people who went out for a boat ride in the afternoon is:

$$ \text {Number of people who went out for a boat ride} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 $$

So, $16$ people went out for a boat ride in the afternoon."
Response:  If there are 7 other people who go fishing in the afternoon and there are 60 campers in total, then the number of campers who go fishing in the morning is:  Number of campers = Total number of campers - Number of campers who go fishing in the afternoon  Number of campers = 60 - 7  Number of campers = 53 Therefore, 53 campers go fishing in the morning.
Response:  In the morning (from 7 am to 12 pm), 36 campers went fishing.  In the afternoon (from 1 pm to 5 pm), 13 campers went fishing again.  Finally, in the evening (from 6 pm to 10 pm), 49 campers went fishing for the third time.  Therefore, there were a total of 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 campers who went fishing at some point during the day.
Response:  We know that there are 44 campers in total and they go fishing at dawn. So, the number of campers who went fishing at dawn is 44.  Now, we are told that 39 campers go fishing in the afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who went fishing at dawn and those who went fishing in the afternoon is 5 (44 - 39).  Finally, we are told that 31 campers go fishing at night. So, the number of campers who did not go fishing at any of these times is 13 (44 - 31).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 53 campers who go fishing in the morning. Then, we have 48 campers who go fishing in the afternoon. Finally, we have 49 campers who go fishing at night. So, if we compare the number of people going fishing at each time, we can see that there are more people going fishing at night than in the morning or afternoon. Therefore, the answer is (D) Night.
Response:  In the morning, 33 people went fishing.  In the afternoon, 34 people went fishing again.  At night, 10 people went fishing again. So in total, how many people went fishing at least once?  Therefore, the answer is 37 (33 + 34 + 10).
Response:  We know that 13 campers went to the boat at dawn and 59 campers left for a hike in the morning. So, the total number of campers who went out is 59 + 13 = 72. Therefore, there were 72 campers in total who went out during the day.
Response:  We know that there are 29 campers who go hiking in the morning and return to the campsite at noon.  Therefore, there are 37 campers (29 + 8) who stay at the campsite during the day and go for a walk after lunch.
Response:  We know that there are 41 campers who go boating in the morning and 4 campers who go hiking in the morning. Therefore, the total number of campers who go out for activities in the morning is 41 + 4 = 45 campers.  In the evening, all 26 campers return from their activities and stay at the campsite. So, the total number of campers who go out for activities in the evening is 45 - 26 = 19 campers.
Response:  We know that there are 46 campers in total and they go out for a boat ride at either 9 am or 2 pm. So, if we assume that all 46 campers go for the boat ride, then the number of campers who go for the boat ride at 9 am is 46/2 = 23. Since there are only 23 campers going for the boat ride at 9 am, the remaining 23 campers must have gone for the boat ride at 2 pm. Therefore, the number of campers who went for the boat ride at 2 pm is 23.
Response:  If there were initially seven fruits on the tree and four of them fell off, then there are three remaining fruits on the tree. So, the number of fruits on the tree now is 3.
Response:  At first, there were four fruits on the tree. If he picked one fruit, then there would be three left on the tree. So, if he picked another fruit, there would be two left on the tree. Therefore, the number of fruits that remained on the tree after he picked two fruits is 2.
"Response:  Since there are seven fruits in total and three of them are ripe, we have:

7 - 3 = 4

So, there are four unripe fruits left on the tree."
Response:  Since Rachel picked two ripe fruits from the tree and there are seven fruits in total on the tree, we can conclude that six of them are not yet ripe (since they were not picked). So, the number of ripe fruits on the tree is 2/7 = 1/3. Therefore, there are three ripe fruits on the tree.
Response:  Rachel picked 6 mature fruits from the tree. Since there are two mature fruits and four immature fruits, we can conclude that the total number of fruits on the tree is 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, the tree has 8 fruits in total.
Response:  Since Rachel picked three mature fruits from the tree, there are now two mature fruits left on the tree.  The total number of immature fruits is 27 - 3 = 24. So, the number of mature fruits on the tree is 2 / 2 = 1. Therefore, the tree can have at most 1 mature fruit.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel picked seven fruits from the tree. Then, two new fruits grew on the tree. So, there are six fruits left on the tree. Finally, we are asked how many fruits the tree can have. Since the tree had six fruits before Rachel picked any, and two new fruits grew afterward, the total number of fruits the tree can have is 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.
Response:  We know that there are two fruits on the tree initially. Then, four more fruits grow on the tree. Finally, three new fruits grow on the tree, bringing the total number of fruits to 9 (2 + 4 + 3 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 fruits on the tree.
Response:  Since 瑞秋 (Rachel) has 52 fruit trees and she picked two fruits from one of them, there are 52 - 2 = 50 remaining fruit trees. Now, we need to find out how many fruits each tree can have. According to the passage, there are seven fruits on each tree. Therefore, the total number of fruits on all 50 trees is 7 x 50 = 350 fruits. So, the answer is 350.
Response:  Rachel has three apple trees and picks eight apples from each tree. So, she collects 8 x 3 = 24 apples in total. Now, there are still nine apples left on each of the three trees. Therefore, the total number of apples on all three trees is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 apples.
Response:  Rachel has four apple trees and picks seven apples from each tree. So, she collects 7 x 4 = 28 apples in total. Since there are still 29 apples left on the trees after Rachel picked her share, that means she did not pick all of them. Therefore, the final number of apples Rachel gets is 28 + 29 = 57 apples.
Response:  Ed threw 20 marbles onto the field, and then Doug threw some more. So, Ed has thrown 20 + (some number) = X marbles in total. Since Doug threw fewer than Ed, we know that X is less than or equal to 39 (the difference between Ed's throw and Doug's throw). Therefore, the answer is X = 39.
Response:  Ed has 45 marbles and wants to know how many more than Doug has. We are given that Doug has 11 small balls. So, we can calculate the number of marbles that Doug has as follows:  Number of marbles = Small balls + Large balls (in this case, 11)  Therefore, the number of marbles that Doug has is:  Number of marbles = 11 + 45 = 56 marbles  Now, let's compare the number of marbles that Doug has with the number of marbles that Ed has:  Number of marbles that Doug has = 56 marbles Number of marbles that Ed has = 45 marbles  Therefore, there are 11 more marbles in Ed's collection than in Doug's collection.
Response:  Ed has 22 marbles and he gives 6 of them to Doug. So, Ed now has 22 - 6 = 16 marbles left.  Now, Doug has 7 + 6 = 13 marbles in total (including the ones he already had). Therefore, there are 16 - 13 = 3 more marbles with Doug than with Ed.
Response:  Ed has 27 marbles initially and wants to give 3 of them to Doug at the field. So, after giving 3 marbles to Doug, how many marbles does Ed have left?  Ed has 27 - 3 = 24 marbles left. Therefore, Doug had initially 24 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Doug threw 24 marbles onto the playground. Then, we are told that Ed found 9 marbles. So, the number of marbles left after Ed found them is:  Number of marbles left = Total number of marbles - Number of marbles found = 24 - 9 = 15 marbles. Therefore, there are 15 more marbles than Doug had.
Response:  Ed has 29 marbles in total and throws 17 small blocks into the playground. To find out how many more marbles Eddie has than Doug, we need to subtract the number of small blocks that Ed threw from his original total number of marbles. So, the answer is:  Number of marbles Eddie has = Total number of marbles - Number of small blocks thrown = 29 - 17 = 12
Response:  Firstly, we know that Eddie threw 19 balls into the amusement park. Then, he gave Doug eight marbles. So, the total number of balls that Eddie threw is 19 + 8 = 27. Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  Ed defeated 21 small balls in an amusement park with 30 marbles. So he has 30 - 21 = 9 marbles left. Now we know that Doug has 91 marbles more than Ed. Therefore, Doug has 91 + 9 = 100 marbles more than Ed.
Response:  Ed has 17 pearls and throws 20 small blocks of wood into the amusement park. Since each block of wood is equal to 3 pearls, there are now 60 pearls (20 x 3 = 60) in the amusement park. Therefore, there are 49 pearls left with Ed (17 - 60 = -49).
Response:  If 408 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 42 students suggest adding pork, then there are more than 10 times as many students who want potatoes added compared to those who want pork added (408/42 = >10). Therefore, if we have to choose one food item based on the suggestions of these students, it should be potatoes.
"Response:  If 479 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 489 students suggest adding pork to the menu, then we can calculate the proportion of students who suggested each food item as follows:

Proportion of students suggesting potatoes = (479/1068) x 100% = 45.2%
Proportion of students suggesting pork = (489/1068) x 100% = 46.3%
So, among the total number of students, approximately 45.2% suggested adding potatoes to the menu, while approximately 46.3% suggested adding pork."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 310 students in total. Then, we have to find out how many students suggested adding potatoes and pork to the menu. According to the question, 185 students recommended adding potatoes, while 26 students recommended adding pork. Therefore, the number of students who thought that both potatoes and pork should be added to the menu is 185 + 26 = 211 students. So, there are 211 students who believed that both potatoes and pork should be included in the menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 288 students were asked to decide which food they prefer between pork and potato. Then, 264 students suggested adding pork to the menu, while 24 students suggested adding potato. Therefore, there are 24 students who want to eat potato.
Response:  If 457 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 63 of them recommend adding pork, then there are 457 - 63 = 494 students who do not recommend adding pork.  Therefore, if more than 63% (i.e., 494/457) of the students recommend adding potatoes, they will be added to the menu.
Response:  If 182 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 166 of them also suggest adding pork, then there are 166 students who want both potatoes and pork in the menu. So, among the remaining 16 students who did not suggest adding either potatoes or pork, there will be an equal number (i.e., 16) of students who will suggest adding potatoes as they will suggest adding pork. Therefore, there will be 16 + 16 = 32 students who will suggest adding potatoes to the menu.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of students who suggested adding each food item to the menu.  For ""土豆"" (tofu), there are 324 students who suggested it.  For ""豬肉"" (pork), there are 374 students who suggested it. And for ""番茄"" (tomato), there are 128 students who suggested it.  Therefore, the final answer is: 土豆 - 324, 豬肉 - 374, 番茄 - 128."
Response:  If 257 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, and 120 students suggest adding pork, then there are 257 + 120 = 377 suggestions for adding these two food items.   Since 97 students suggest adding tomatoes, there are 97 additional suggestions for this food item. Therefore, the total number of suggestions is 377 + 97 = 474.
Response:  If 144 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, and there are 467 total students, then the proportion of students who suggested adding potatoes is (144/467) = 0.305. Similarly, if 79 students suggest adding tomatoes to the menu, and there are 467 total students, then the proportion of students who suggested adding tomatoes is (79/467) = 0.172.
Response:  If 228 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, and 337 students suggest adding pork to the menu, then there are a total of 565 students (228 + 337). However, if only 23 students suggest adding tomatoes to the menu, then there are a total of 548 students (565 - 23). Therefore, the correct answer is 548.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 450 students in total who will be participating in this survey. Since 450 - 66 = 384 students did not suggest adding any new food to the menu, and among them, 38 students suggested adding pork to the menu, so the number of students who suggested adding pork is 38. Therefore, the answer is 38.
Response:  If there are 218 students who want to add beef and 351 students who want to add pork, then we can calculate the number of students who will choose both options as follows:  Number of students choosing both = Total number of students - Number of students choosing only one option (beef or pork)  In this case, the total number of students is 579 (218 + 351), so the number of students choosing both options is:  Number of students choosing both = 579 - (218 + 351) = 579 - 569 = 10  Therefore, 10 students will choose both beef and pork.
Response:  If 269 students suggest adding pork and 330 students suggest adding potatoes, then there are more students who suggest adding potatoes than those who suggest adding pork. Therefore, the number of students who will choose to add potatoes over pork is greater than 100 (i.e., 330 - 269).  As for the remaining 76 students who suggest adding tomatoes, they will not be affected by the previous choices since they did not suggest adding either pork or potatoes. So, none of them will change their minds.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can divide the number of girls by the number of boys: Number of girls = 569 Girls / Boys = 569/236 = 2.41 times as many girls as boys So, there are approximately 2.41 times as many girls as boys in this school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls:  Number of boys / Number of girls = 841 / 34 = 25.67 (round down to nearest whole number) Therefore, there are approximately 26 more male students than female students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 male students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls and 469 boys in school. If we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of male students = 697 - 228 = 469 Now, we want to find out how many male students are left after deducting the number of female students who have more than one boyfriend. So, let's divide the remaining male students by the number of females with more than one boyfriend: Number of male students left = 469 / 130 = 35 males Therefore, there are 35 male students left in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls. So, the total number of students in the school is: 635 + (510 x 2) = 1145. Therefore, there are 1145 male students in the school.
Response:  If there are 868 female students and 537 male students in the school, then the total number of students is: 868 + 537 = 1405.  Therefore, the number of students in the school is 1405.
Response:  If there are 700 female students and 458 male students in the school, then we can say that the number of male students is 142 more than the number of female students. So, if we add 142 to 700, we get 842. Therefore, there are 842 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in the school initially. Then, 418 new students join the school, which means the total number of students in the school now is: 706 + 222 = 928. So, there are 928 students in this school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school initially. Then, 44 more girls join the school, so now the total number of girls is 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, the number of female students in the school is 946.
Response:  Firstly, there are 632 female students and 410 male students in the school initially. Then, 465 additional female students join the school, making the total number of female students 1097 (632 + 465). Therefore, the ratio of female students to male students is:  1097 females / 410 males = 2.68:1
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school initially. Then, 682 girls join the school with 8 boys. To find out how many female students there are now, we need to subtract the number of male students who joined from the initial total number of females. Therefore, the number of female students in the school after the new students joined is:  Number of female students = Initial number of female students - Number of male students who joined  = 732 - 8  = 724 So, there are 724 female students in the school after the new students joined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in one class. If all of them join the school, then the total number of male students will be 214 + (496 - 135) = 781 males. Therefore, there are 781 male students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626.  Now, let's consider the teachers. There are 36 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of male to female students is 318 : 308 = 105 : 94.  Finally, the total number of students including teachers is 626 + 36 = 662.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers. There are 772 teachers in the school, so we add them to the total number of students: 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396 people in the school.
Response:  If there are 402 more female students than male students in the school, and there are 739 female students in total, then the number of male students must be equal to 739 - 402 = 337. Therefore, there will be 337 male students in the school.
Response:  If there are 458 more female students than male students in school, and there are 692 total female students, then there must be 692 - 458 = 234 male students in school. Therefore, the number of students in school is 234 + 692 = 926.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 362 male students and 257 female students in the school initially. Then, another 403 female students join the school, making the total number of female students to be 403 + 257 = 660. Therefore, the ratio of female students to male students is 660 : 362 = 1.85. So, there are about 1.85 times more female students than male students in this school.
Response:  According to the question, 艾德華德 (Edward) has $1800 and he used $1600 of it. So, Edward has $200 left ($1800 - $1600 = $200).
Response:  According to the question, 艾德华德 (Edward) has $130 and he spent some money on something. We know that Edward has $30 left after spending money. So, we can calculate the amount of money Ed...
Response:  Firstly, Edgar spent $900 and then he gave you $800. So, Edgar had $120 left ($900 - $800 = $120). Then, Edgar spent another $800 and gave you $1700 ($800 + $1700 = $2500). Therefore, before Edgar used up all his money, he had $2300 ($2500 - $200 = $2300).
Response:  Edward spent $16 on 92 books, so each book cost him $0.17 ( $16 / 92). Since he has $6 left after buying the books, we can calculate how much money he had before buying the books as follows: $6 = $X - $0.17 X, where $X is the amount of money Edward had before buying the books. Solving for $X, we get $X = $6 / ($0.17) = $36. So, Edward had $36 before buying the books.
Response:  We know that Edgar spent $6 on two books, and each book costs the same amount of money. Therefore, we can say that the cost of one book is half of the total amount spent by Edgar, which is $6 / 2 = $3 per book. So, each book costs $3.
Response:  According to the question, Edgar spent $600 on books and $160 on pens. So he has $190 left before he spends all his money. Therefore, Edgar has $190 - $600 = -$410 left before he spends all his money.
Response:  Edgar spent $400 to buy books and $300 to buy pens. So he has $700 left. Now let's calculate how much money Edgar spent on buying books and pens separately: Book price = $400 Pens price = $300 Total cost = $400 + $300 = $700 Therefore, Edgar spent $700 / $12 = $58.33 on buying books and pens combined.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Edgar spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. Therefore, he has $19 left after buying both items. Now, let's calculate how much of that amount was spent on books versus pens. To do this, we can divide the total amount Edgar had ($19) by the cost of each item (books = $16, pens = $8). Books: $16 / $19 = 0.84 Pens: $8 / $19 = 0.42 So, Edgar spent approximately 84% of his money on books and 58% on pens.
Response:  After Edgar used $17 of his $20 bill to buy something, he had $3 left. Then, he gave $10 of that remaining amount to his friend as change. So, Edgar had $3 - $10 = $7 left before he spent all of it.
Response:  Zachary did 44 times of bending and stretching movements, while David did 58 times. So, they have done a total of 102 (44 + 58) bending and stretching movements together.
Response:  Zachary did 51 times of bending and stretching movements, while David did 44 times. Therefore, Zachary did more than David by 7 times (51 - 44 = 7).
Response:  David did 44 times of bending forward, Drew did 9 times, and Zachary did more than 10 times. So, the correct answer is (David) + (Drew) + (Zachary) = 53.
Response:  According to the question, David did 51 times of bending and reaching movements, while Drew did 49 times. So, the difference between them is 2 (51 - 49). Therefore, David and Zachary have done 2 more bending and reaching movements than Drew.
Response:  According to the question, Zachary did 59 times of forward bending and 44 times of backward bending. David did 19 times of both forward and backward bending movements. So, the difference between them is 27 times (59 - 36 = 27). Therefore, David performed 27 more times of bending movements than Zachary.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Zachary did 44 times of forward bending exercise and 17 times of backward bending exercise. As for David, he did 30 times of forward bending exercise and less than 13 times of backward bending exercise. Therefore, we can conclude that David did more forward bending exercises than Zachary. In terms of total number of bending exercises, David did 30 + 17 = 47 times, while Zachary did 44 + 13 = 57 times. So, David did 10 more bending exercises than Zachary.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Zachary did 53 times of forward bending exercise and 14 times of backward bending exercise. David did 17 times of multiple bending exercises but had fewer shrinkage movements than Zachary by 10 times. So, we can conclude that Zachary has done more than twice as many bending exercises as David. Therefore, the answer is 53 x 2 = 106.
Response:  Zachary did 35 times of forward bending exercise and 3 times of backward bending exercise, while David did 58 times of forward bending exercise. Therefore, the difference between them is 23 times (58 - 35). Since David did more forward bending exercises than Zachary, he has done 87 - 23 = 64 more times of forward bending exercises than Zachary.
Response:  Zachary did 46 times of forward bending exercise and 58 times of backward bending exercise, while David did 38 times of multiple bending exercises. However, David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary, with 62 times less. Therefore, the number of times Zackary can do sit-ups is ________________.
Response:  According to the question, Zachary did 19 times of bending movement, David did 39 times, and John did 26 times (including the 13 times that he subtracted from David). Therefore, David did 39 - 13 = 26 times more bending movements than Zachary.
Response:  Zachary did 51 times of bending forward movement, while David did 22 times.  Therefore, John did more than 51 - 22 = 29 times of bending forward movements compared to David.
Response:  According to the question, Zachary did 15 times of bending forward movement, and David did 39 times.  Therefore, the difference between their number of movements is 24 (39 - 15).  Now, let's compare Zachary with John. The question states that Zachary did more than John. So, we can say that Zachary did at least 24 + 9 = 33 more times of bending forward movement than John.
Response:  According to the question, David did 30 times of bending forward (俯仰) in today's physical education class. If he jumped over 37 times, then he must have done more than 30 times of bending forward. So, the answer is: More than 30 times.
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did 38 forward bends and Zachary did 20 forward bends. So together they have done 38 + 20 = 58 forward bends. Now, we are asked how many backbends (俯仰动作) they have done in total. Since each forward bend is equivalent to two backbends, we can say that David has done 38 x 2 = 76 backbends, and Zachary has done 20 x 2 = 40 backbends. Therefore, the total number of backbends done by both David and Zachary is 76 + 40 = 116 backbends.
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did 40 times more backbends than today's physical education class. So if David did 40 x 3 = 120 backbends, and Zachary did 34 + 62 = 96 backbends, then we can conclude that David did fewer backbends than Zachary. Specifically, David did 120 - 96 = 24 less backbends than Zachary.
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did 36 times more forward bends than backbends (36 vs 33). So if David did 58 forward bends and 33 backbends, then he must have done 25 more forward bends than backbends (58 - 33 = 25). Therefore, Zachary did 73 forward bends (58 + 15 = 73).
Response:  David did 27 times of forward bending and less than 30 times of backbend. So he did (27 - 30) = -3 times of backbend.  Now, Zachary did 5 times of forward bending and 17 times of backbend. Therefore, Zachary did (17 - 5) = 12 times more backbends than David.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages for each subject. For mathematics, there are 5 pages of learning activities, so the total number of pages is 5. For reading comprehension, there are 2 pages of reading passages and questions, so the total number of pages is also 5. Therefore, the total number of pages for both subjects is 10 (5 + 5).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages for both tasks. For the three-page math problem, there are 3 pages in total. For the four-page reading comprehension passage, there are also 4 pages in total. Therefore, the total number of pages needed to be read before starting the math problem is 3 + 4 = 7 pages.
Response:  If Rachel finished reading 5 pages of math learning materials and then read more pages after that, let's assume she read x pages in total.  To find out how many pages she needs to read for the next task (which is 7 pages), we can divide x by 7. So, Rachel needs to read x/7 pages for the next task.
Response:  If Rachel does 7 pages of math homework and each page has 4 questions, then she has done a total of 28 questions (7 x 4 = 28). Now, if she reads more than 4 pages of reading comprehension homework, let's assume she reads 6 pages (6 x 4 = 24). So, in total, Rachel has completed 52 questions (28 + 24 = 52).
"Response:  If Rachel spends more time doing math homework than reading homework, and she has to write an eight-page essay, we can calculate the number of pages she needs to write based on the ratio of time spent on math homework to time spent on reading homework.  Suppose Rachel spends x hours on math homework and y hours on reading homework. Since Rachel wants to write an eight-page essay, let z be the total number of pages she needs to write. Then, we can use the following equation to find z:

z = (x/y) \* 8

Now, we need to solve for z. For example, if Rachel spends three times as much time on math homework as she does on reading homework, then x = 3y. Substituting this value into the previous equation gives us:

z = (3y/y) \* 8 = 3

Therefore, Rachel needs to write three pages of text to fulfill her assignment."
Response:  If Rachel has to write an eight-page essay for her math homework and she is given six pages of reading material from her textbook, then we can calculate the number of pages Rachel needs to write as follows: Number of pages needed = Total pages - Number of pages read = 8 - 6 = 2 pages So, Rachel needs to write two additional pages beyond what she reads in her textbook.
Response:  If Racheal needs to complete 10 pages of math homework and each page has 3 problems, then... (calculate)...she will need to solve 30 problems in total!
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of pages required for each activity:  For 2-page math worksheets, we will need 4 pages (2 x 2 = 4).  For 3-page reading comprehension exercises, we will also need 3 pages (3 x 3 = 9). Finally, for the 10-page biology practice sheets, we will need 10 pages (10 x 1 = 10). Therefore, in total, we will need 26 pages (4 + 9 + 10 = 26) to complete all three activities.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages for each subject. For mathematics, there are 2 pages of reading comprehension and 96 pages of practice exercises, so the total is 98 pages. For biology, there are 2 pages of reading comprehension and 94 pages of practice exercises, so the total is 96 pages. Therefore, the difference between the two subjects is 1 page (98 - 96 = 1).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages that Rex needs to complete for his homework. Based on the information provided in the question, Rex has been assigned 11 pages of mathematics learning tasks and 2 pages of reading comprehension tasks. Therefore, the total number of pages he needs to complete is:

11 + 2 = 13 pages

So, Rex needs to complete 13 pages of homework."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 蕾切爾 has to do 7 pages of math learning activities and 11 pages of reading comprehension exercises.  Therefore, the total number of pages for math is 7 + 2 = 9 pages.  For reading comprehension, it is 11 pages.  Now, let's calculate the ratio of reading comprehension pages to math pages. We have 11 pages of reading comprehension / 9 pages of math = 1.22 or approximately 1.23. So, the girl has more pages of reading comprehension than math.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages that Rex needs to read and learn from. Based on the information provided, Rex needs to read 11 pages for reading comprehension practice and 29 pages for biology learning activities. Therefore, the total number of pages is 11 + 29 = 40 pages. Now, let's calculate how many pages Rex can write in each subject area. For mathematics, Rex has been asked to write 5 pages, which is equivalent to 1/8th of the total number of pages (40 pages / 8 = 5 pages). Similarly, for reading comprehension, Rex has been asked to write 3 pages, which is equivalent to 1/6th of the total number of pages (40 pages / 6 = 3 pages).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages that Rex needs to read and learn from. Based on the given information, Rex needs to read and learn from seven pages of reading comprehension passages and three pages of biology passages. Therefore, the total number of pages is = 7 + 3 = 10 pages. Now, let's calculate the number of pages that Rex can write in math and biology. Since Rex wants to write a few pages in both subjects, we can assume that he will write half a page (or 50% of a page) in each subject. Therefore, the number of pages that Rex can write in math is = 10 / 2 = 5 pages. Similarly, the number of pages that Rex can write in biology is also = 10 / 2 = 5 pages. So, the final answer is: Number of pages that Rex can write = 5 pages in math and 5 pages in biology.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages that Rex needs to read and write for both tasks combined. For reading comprehension, he needs to read 10 pages x 3 questions = 30 pages. For writing, he needs to write 5 pages x 2 tasks = 10 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Rex needs to complete is 30 + 10 = 40 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of pages for each subject separately. For reading comprehension, there are usually 2-3 pages per passage, so let's assume an average of 2.5 pages per passage. Therefore, if she needs to read 10 passages, it would be around 25 pages (10 x 2.5 = 25). Next, for math, there are usually 4-6 problems per page, depending on their difficulty level and format. So, assuming an average of 5 problems per page, if she needs to complete 10 pages of math exercises, it would be around 50 problems (10 x 5 = 50). In total, then, she would need to spend around 75 minutes (25 + 50) reading comprehension and doing math exercises.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages for each subject. For reading comprehension, there are 4 pages. For mathematics, there are 7 pages. And for biology, there are 19 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages is: 4 + 7 + 19 = 30 pages. So, the student has to do 30 pages of homework.
Response:  Jack received six emails in total. In the morning, he received two emails, and in the afternoon, he received another two emails. So, the number of emails Jack received in the morning is 2, and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is also 2. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is 2 + 2 = 4.  Hence, the correct answer is (D) 4.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and in the afternoon, he received 8 emails. So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon and those he received in the morning is:  8 - 6 = 2 emails. Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
Response:  If Jack received four emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he received a total of... (do the calculation)...emails that day. Therefore, if he received five emails in the afternoon, he would have received... (do the calculation again)...emails that day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received six emails in total.  He received three emails in the morning and three emails in the afternoon. So, he received an email every 2 hours (morning + afternoon). Therefore, Jack receives an average of 3 emails per day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 5 emails in the morning and then he received 8 more emails in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 5 + 8 = 13 emails.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received four emails in the morning and five emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of nine emails that day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received three emails in the morning, four emails in the afternoon, and eight emails in the evening. So, in total, Jack received 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 emails.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in total.  In the afternoon, he received 7 emails, and in the evening, he received 17 emails. So, we can calculate the number of emails Jack received during each time period as follows:  Morning (9 am - 3 pm): 7 emails Evening (3 pm - 6 pm): 0 emails Night (6 pm - 10 pm): 17 emails Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is: 7 + 0 + 17 = 24 emails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is 9 + 7 = 16. So, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning, then he received 5 emails in the afternoon, and finally he received 4 emails in the evening. So, in total, Jack received 10 + 5 + 4 = 19 emails.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received three emails.  So in total, he received 3 + 6 = 9 emails that day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails and 64 messages today morning. Then he received 5 emails and 504 messages in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 3 + 64 = 67 emails and 5 + 504 = 569 messages today.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received five emails and six letters in the morning. In the afternoon, he received nine emails and seven letters. So, in total, Jack received 5 + 6 = 11 messages in one day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. Then he received 3 emails and 44 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 13 emails (10 + 3) and 56 letters (12 + 44). Therefore, the answer is Yes, Jack received more emails than letters in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning, and then he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 8 + 7 = 15 messages during the day. Therefore, the answer is Yes, Jack received more messages in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails this morning and then sent out 91 emails later in the day. So far, he has sent out a total of 97 emails (6 + 91 = 97). Then, after lunch, he wrote 74 more emails, bringing his total number of emails sent today to 171 (97 + 74 = 171). Therefore, Jack receives an average of 171 emails per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack received four emails and Li wrote two emails to him. So, in total, Jack received six emails (4 + 2). Then, after lunchtime, Jack received eight more emails. Therefore, the number of emails Jack sent per day is: 6 + 8 = 14 emails/day
Response:  If Jack receives 9 emails in one day and he receives an email every morning, then he will receive 7 emails in the morning (since there are 9 emails in total). Therefore, Jack will receive 7 + 1 = 8 emails in the afternoon. So, Jack will receive 9 - 7 = 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received three emails in the afternoon of Friday, five emails in the morning of Saturday, and sixteen emails in the evening of Saturday. So, we can calculate the total number of emails Jack received as follows:  Total number of emails = Number of afternoons + Number of mornings + Number of evenings  Total number of emails = 3 + 5 + 16 = 24 Therefore, Jack received more emails in the evening of Saturday than he did in the afternoon or morning of that day.
Response:  If Jack received three emails in the afternoon and six emails in the morning of one day, then he received a total of nine emails that day (3 + 6 = 9).  Now, if he received ten emails every evening, then he would have received a total of 30 emails that day (10 x 3 = 30).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the blue ball is 9 inches and the height of the red ball is 12 inches. Therefore, we can calculate the difference in height as follows:  Difference = 12 - 9 = 3 inches. So, the distance traveled by the blue ball is 3 inches more than the distance traveled by the red ball.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 同青 has jumped 31 inches and 青 has jumped 35 inches. To find out how many times they have jumped more than each other, we need to subtract their jumps from each other. So, 同青 has jumped 31 - 35 = -4 inches less than 青. Therefore, they have jumped more than each other 4 times.
Response:  Green jumps 36 inches and blue jumps 17 inches. Since green is farther than blue, we can say that green jumped x inches more than blue. Therefore, the distance green jumped is 36 - 17 = 19 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 青 (Qing) can jump 25 inches and 鼠 (Shu) can jump 18 inches. Therefore, the distance between them is:  Distance = 25 - 18 = 7 inches. Now, let's calculate how far Shu jumps: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 inches / 0.5 seconds = 4 inches. So, Shu jumps 4 inches.
Response:  Green jumps 19 inches and blue jumps 10 inches farther than green. So, blue jumps 39 inches (19 + 10). Now, old mouse jumps 20 inches farther than blue, so old mouse jumps 59 inches (39 + 20).
Response:  Green jumps 39 inches and blue jumps 94 inches. So, green jumps farther than blue by 55 inches (94 - 39 = 55).
Response:  Green jumps 32 inches and blue jumps 25 inches. Since green jumps farther than blue, we can say that green jumps 9 inches more than blue (32 - 25 = 9). So, the distance Blue jumps is 26 inches. Therefore, the length Blue jumps is 26 inches.
Response:  Green jumps 33 inches and blue jumps 24 inches. So, green jumps farther than blue by 9 inches (33 - 24 = 9). Now, let's compare the jumping distance of the old mouse to that of the bug. The old mouse jumps 5 inches shorter than the bug, so the difference in their jumping distances is 9 + (-5) = 14 inches. Therefore, the old mouse jumps 14 inches less than the bug.
Response:  The grasshopper jumps 13 inches and lands 2 inches away from its starting point. So, the distance traveled by the grasshopper is 13 - 2 = 11 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the grasshopper can jump 35 inches (90 cm) in one hop. Then, we are told that it jumps away from the obstacle at a distance of 10 cm for each hop. Therefore, if the grasshopper makes $n$ hops, it will move away from the obstacle by a total distance of $10 \times n$ cm. Now, we need to find out how many hops the grasshopper makes in total. We can do this by using the information given in the question that the grasshopper takes $t = 2$ seconds to cross the obstacle. Since there are $60$ seconds in $1$ minute, we have: $$time = 2 \text{ seconds} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ minutes}$$ Therefore, the grasshopper makes $n = time \cdot t = \frac{1}{60} \cdot 2 = 30$ hops in total. So, the answer is $30$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the grasshopper jumps 19 inches (or 48 cm) and the old mouse jumps 10 cm less than the grasshopper, which is 9 cm. Therefore, the distance the blue jay jumps is: Blue Jay = Grasshopper - Old Mouse = 19 inches - 9 cm = 10 inches or 25 cm.
Response:  Green jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. Therefore, the distance between green and the grasshopper after they landed is 39 - 19 = 20 inches. Now, let's calculate how far the old mouse jumped. Since the old mouse jumped lower than green, it jumped 12 inches less than 20 inches, which means it jumped 20 - 12 = 8 inches. So, the old mouse jumped 8 inches.
Response:  Green jumped 21 inches, and old mouse jumped 25 inches. So, green jumped farther than old mouse. Now, let's compare their jumps in terms of height. Green jumped 16 inches lower than old mouse. Therefore, old mouse jumped farther than green.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the blue ball is 39 inches and the height of the red ball is 17 inches. Therefore, we can calculate the difference in height as follows:  Difference = Blue ball height - Red ball height = 39 - 17 = 22 inches So, the distance between the two balls after jumping is 22 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the big mouse can jump 9 inches (23 cm) and the small mouse can jump 3 inches (7.6 cm). So, if they both jump together, the total distance traveled will be 9 + 3 = 12 inches (30.5 cm).
Response:  Green jumps 37 inches, and small mouse jumps 16 inches less than green. So, small mouse jumps 21 inches (37 - 16 = 21). Therefore, the difference in jumping distance between the two mice is 21 inches.
Response:  Since Mary has already used up five bowls of flour (5), she needs to add more flour to make another batch of dough. To calculate how many more bowls of flour she needs, we can divide the total amount of flour required (14 bowls) by the number of bowls she has already used (5). So, Mary needs an additional 9 bowls of flour (14 - 5 = 9).  Similarly, since she has already added 6 bowls of sugar (6), she needs to add more sugar to make another batch of dough. We can divide the total amount of sugar required (14 bowls) by the number of bowls she has already added (6) to find out how many more bowls of sugar she needs. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 8 bowls of sugar (14 - 6 = 8).
Response:  If Mary has already used 4 cups of flour and needs 9 cups for the recipe, then she will need an additional 5 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5).  Similarly, if the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and Mary has already used 4 cups, then she will need an additional 7 cups of sugar (11 - 4 = 7).
Response:  If Mary has already used up 4 bowls of flour (as mentioned in the problem), then she needs to add 8 more bowls of flour to make the required 13 bowls. So, the number of extra bowls of flour needed is 8.
Response:  If Mary has already put down 3 cups of flour (which is equivalent to 11 bowls), and she needs an additional 2 cups of flour, then she will need a total of 5 cups of flour (or 13 bowls).
Response:  If Mary has already added three cups of flour and needs to add six more cups, then we need to calculate how many cups of flour are left to be added.  We know that there are 11 cups of sugar required in the recipe, so if Mary has already added three cups of flour, she has used up three out of 11 cups of sugar. Therefore, we need to add six more cups of flour to make up for the remaining seven cups of sugar. So, the total number of cups of flour needed is 7 + 3 = 10 cups.
Response:  If Mary has already put away 3 cups of flour and needs an additional 2 cups for the recipe, then she will need to add 2 x 4 = 8 cups of flour in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added three bowls of flour (3 x 9 = 27 bowls) and 60 bowls of sugar (60 / 5 = 12 bowls). So, she needs to add 45 more bowls of flour (27 - 45 = -18 bowls). Therefore, Mary needs to subtract 18 bowls of flour from the total amount required for the recipe.
"Response:  If Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (out of 14 cups required) and she needs to add more sugar (out of 5 cups required), then we can calculate the number of additional cups of sugar needed as follows:

Number of remaining cups of sugar = 5 - 2 = 3 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 additional cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  If Mary has already added 11 bowls of flour and needs to add more, then she will need to add 3 more bowls of flour (since there are 12 bowls in total). So, the answer is 3 bowls of flour.
Response:  Since Mary has already used up seven bowls of flour, she needs to add an additional five bowls of flour (5 x 10 = 50) to make the required amount of dough for the recipe. Therefore, Mary needs a total of 60 bowls of flour (10 + 50 = 60). To calculate how many bowls of sugar and salt are needed, we can use the same ratio as in the original recipe: 10 bowls of sugar and 80 bowls of salt. So, Mary needs a total of 90 bowls of sugar and salt (10 + 80 = 90).
Response:  If there are already two cups of flour missing (which is equivalent to 160 grams), then we need to add an additional 6 cups of flour (which is equivalent to 384 grams) to make up for it. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed would be 384 - 160 = 224 grams.
Response:  We know that Mary has already used up 5 cups of flour and now she needs to add sugar and salt according to the recipe. The ratio of sugar to flour is 3:2, so for every cup of flour, we need to add 1/3 cup of sugar. Since Mary has already used up 5 cups of flour, she needs to add 1 1/3 cups of sugar (5 x 1/3 = 1 1/3). Similarly, the ratio of salt to flour is 1:4, so for every cup of flour, we need to add 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Since Mary has already used up 5 cups of flour, she needs to add 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt (5 x 1/4 = 1 1/4). Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 1/3 cups of sugar and 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt to make the cake.
"Response:  If Mary has already added two cups of sugar to the mixture, and the recipe requires 13 cups of sugar in total, then we can calculate how many more cups she needs to add as follows:

Number of remaining cups of sugar = Total amount of sugar required - Amount of sugar already added
= 13 cups - 2 cups
= 11 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to the mixture."
Response:  If Mary has already put four cups of sugar in the mixture, and the recipe requires nine cups of flour, then she needs to add five more cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (which is equivalent to 400 grams), and the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar (which is equivalent to 1200 grams), then she needs to add an additional 8 cups of flour (or 1600 grams) to make up for the missing amount of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 8 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has already used up 11 bowls of flour (which is equal to 11/2 cups), then she needs an additional 3 cups of flour to make the recipe complete. As for the sugar, since the recipe requires 5 bowls or 5 cups of sugar, and Mary has already used up 1 cup, she still needs 4 more cups of sugar. Therefore, the final answer is:  Mary needs 3 cups of flour and 4 cups of sugar.
Response:  If Mary has already added three cups of sugar and ten cups of flour to make the cake, and she needs to add five more cups of flour but not sugar, then... (1 cup of flour = 40 g)...she will need to add an additional 5 x 40 = 200 grams of flour. So, in total, Mary will need to add 3 + 200 = 203 grams of flour to make the cake.
"Response:  If Mary has already put away 3 cups of flour (which is equivalent to 3 x 200g = 600g), and the recipe requires 13 cups of flour in total, then we can calculate how much flour Mary still needs to add as follows:

Mary still needs to add: 13 - 3 = 10 cups of flour (or 10 x 200g = 2000g)

Therefore, if Mary wants to make sure she has enough flour for the recipe, she will need to add an additional 2000g of flour."
Response:  If Mary has already added seven bowls of flour and sixteen bowls of sugar, then she needs to add how many more bowls of flour to make up for the difference between the required amount of flour (14 bowls) and the amount she has already added (7 bowls)? So, the answer is 7 + 14 = 21 bowls of flour needed.
Response:  If Mary has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar to make the cake batter, then she needs to add an additional 1 cup of sugar to reach the required amount of 11 cups for the recipe. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1 cup.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour to make the cake batter. To find out how much more flour she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of flour needed = Original amount of flour - Amount already used

In this case, the original amount of flour required is 3 cups + 10 cups + 15 cups = 38 cups. Since Mary has already used 6 cups, we need to subtract that from the total amount:

Amount of flour needed = 38 cups - 6 cups = 32 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 32 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  Since Mary has already added four cups of flour to the mixture, she needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour (since the recipe calls for 9 cups in total). Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar, 7 cups of flour, and 4 cups of salt required for the recipe. Since two cups of cornstarch have already been added, we need to subtract that from the total amount of ingredients needed. Therefore, the number of additional cups of cornstarch needed is:  9 - 2 = 7 cups.
Response:  If we have 11 cups of sugar and we need to add 9 cups of salt, then we will have 20 cups of sugar left after adding the salt (11 - 9 = 2). So, we need to add 3 more cups of sugar (2 + 3 = 5) to make up for the missing sugar. Therefore, the final amount of sugar needed is 5 cups.
Response:  If Mary has already added four cups of sugar to the mixture, and the recipe requires seven cups in total, then she needs to add three more cups (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  If Mary has already put ten cups of sugar in the bowl, and the recipe requires twelve cups of sugar, then she needs to add two more cups of sugar (12 - 10 = 2).  Similarly, if the recipe requires fourteen cups of flour, and Mary has already used ten cups (14 - 10 = 4), then she needs to add four more cups of flour (4). Therefore, Mary needs to add two cups of sugar and four cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  If there are 19 bird species families living in the mountain area and they migrate to warmer countries for winter, then:

* 60% of 19 = 11.4 bird species families (approximately) will leave for winter migration.
* Therefore, approximately 11 bird species families will be left behind in the mountain area during winter."
"Response:  If 7 bird families leave to go south for winter, and there are 87 bird families in total living near the mountain, then we have:

Number of bird families left = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that left for winter
= 87 - 7
= 80

So, there are 80 bird families remaining near the mountain after 7 bird families have left for winter."
Response:  We know that 20 birds migrated away from their original home to escape the cold winter. So, there are 20 - 14 = 6 remaining families of birds in the mountain area near their original homes.
"Response:  If 23 bird families fly to Africa and 37 bird families fly to Asia, then we have:

Total number of bird families = 85 - 23 + 37 = 49

So, there are 49 bird families left in the mountain area after some families migrate to Africa and Asia."
Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain.  If 42 bird families fly to Africa and 31 bird families fly to Asia, we can calculate the number of birds flying to each region as follows:  Number of birds flying to Africa = 42 x 8 = 336 birds Number of birds flying to Asia = 31 x 8 = 252 birds Therefore, there are more birds flying to Africa than to Asia. The difference between these two numbers is 84 birds (336 - 252).
"Response:  If there are 38 bird families living near the mountain and they migrate to different regions as follows:  * 47 bird families fly to Africa.  * 94 bird families fly to Asia.  To find out how many more bird families fly to Asia than to Africa, we need to subtract the number of bird families that fly to Africa from the total number of bird families that fly to Asia:  

$$ \text {Number of bird families that fly to Asia} - \text{Number of bird families that fly to Africa} = \text {More birds in Asia than in Africa } $$

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  $ \text {Number of bird families that fly to Asia} = 94 $  $ \text {Number of bird families that fly to Africa} = 47 $  Subtracting $ 94$ from $ 47 $ gives us the difference between the two numbers:  $$ 57 $$  Therefore, there are $ 57 $ more bird families that fly to Asia than to Africa."
Response:  We know that there are 18 bird families moving towards warmer areas near mountains. If 38% of these birds migrate to Africa and 80% move to Asia, then we can calculate the number of birds that migrated as follows: Number of birds that migrated = (38/100) x 18 = 64 birds Now, let's convert this percentage to a decimal value: 64 / 18 = 3.57 or approximately 3.6 birds That means around 3.6 birds out of every 18 bird families moved away from their original habitats to escape the harsh winter weather.
Response:  If there are already 87 bird families living in the mountain area and 18 new bird species join them, then the total number of bird families in the mountain area will be:  87 + 18 = 105 bird families.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that ""冬天將近"" means winter is approaching. So, many animals will migrate to warmer places.  Next, we are told that there are 9 bird families living near a mountain.  Then, we learn that 59 bird species from other areas have flown over for the winter.  Finally, we find out that 24 new bird species have arrived at the mountain area from the North Pole.  Therefore, the total number of birds in the mountain area during winter is: 9 + 59 = 68 bird families x 10 (average number of birds per family) = 680 birds."
Response:  If there are initially 41 bird species families living near the mountain, and they all migrate away for winter, then there will be no birds left in the area during that time. So, the number of bird species families remaining in the area after migration is zero (0).
"Response:  If there are initially 45 bird families living near the mountain and winter is approaching, we can assume that each family has an average of 3-4 birds (this is just an estimate, as different species may have varying sizes). So, in total, there would be around 135-140 birds living nearby the mountain. Now, if many birds migrate to warmer countries for the winter, let's assume that half of them (around 72 birds) fly away. This means that around 63 birds will remain in the area (45 initial families x 3-4 birds per family = 135-140 birds; 72 birds flying away = 63 birds remaining). Therefore, out of the original 45 bird families, around 39% (63/135) will stay behind during the winter months."
"Response:  If 35 bird families flew to Asia and 62 bird families flew to Africa, we can calculate the difference between them as follows:

Difference = 62 - 35 = 27

So, there are 27 more bird families that flew to Africa than to Asia."
Response:  Firstly, we know that many animals migrate to warmer countries near winter. So, there will be more birds in the mountainous area during this time of year. Secondly, we are told that 26 new bird species from the North Pole have arrived in the nearby mountains. This means that the total number of birds in the area has increased significantly. Lastly, we are given that two bird species from the North Pole fly south for the winter. This implies that the number of birds in the area may decrease slightly due to migration. Therefore, the final answer is:  Birds in the mountainous area near winter:  (26 + x) - 2, where x represents the number of birds that flew south for the winter.
Response:  Paul has already thrown away 70 books before the end of the school year, so he has 253 - 70 = 183 remaining pens.
Response:  We know that Paul received 551 books as his birthday gift and he has already given away or sold 374 of them (551 - 374 = 177). So, there are 177 pens left in the box.
Response:  Paul has 440 pieces of paper and he gives away 111 to his friends. So, he has 329 pieces of paper left (440 - 111 = 329).
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul received 65 pens as a birthday gift and shared them with his friends at school over the course of a year. This means that each friend received an average of 213/65 = 3.27 pens per month.  Since Paul kept 16 pens for himself, he must have given away 213 - 16 = 207 pens in total. Therefore, the number of pens that Paul has already given away is 207.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received 589 pens as a gift for his birthday and he gave away 571 of them to his friends. So, he has 161 pens left with him. Now, let's calculate how many more pens Paul lost than what he gave away. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pens he gave away (571) from the total number of pens he received (589). Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is: 589 - 571 = 18.So, Paul lost 18 pens more than what he gave away.
Response:  Paul has 110 pens in total and gives away 90 of them to his friends, leaving him with 412 pens. To find out how many more pens he has than what he gave away, we can subtract the number of pens he gave away from the total number of pens he had:  Number of pens Paul has = Total number of pens - Number of pens given away  In this case, the total number of pens is 110, and the number of pens given away is 90, so:  Number of pens Paul has = 110 - 90 = 20  Therefore, Paul has 20 more pens than what he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul received 563 pens from his friends and he himself wrote 558 pens. So, the total number of pens he wrote is 558 + 563 = 1121 pens. Now, we need to find out how many pens he has left after giving them away. If he gave away 332 pens, then the number of pens he has left is 1121 - 332 = 789 pens. Therefore, Paul received 789 pens as gifts on his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 52 pens from his friends and he himself threw away 535 pens, so the total number of pens he had is:  52 + 535 = 687 pens.  Now, we are asked how many pens have been lost or taken away. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pens Paul has left (492) from the total number of pens he had:  687 - 492 = 195 pens. Therefore, 195 pens have been lost or taken away.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 pens as gifts and he ended up with 154 pens after some were lost or taken away. So, we can calculate the number of pens that were lost or taken away using the following formula: Number of pens lost = Total number of pens - Number of pens left = 521 - 154 = 367 pens. Therefore, 367 pens were lost or taken away from Paul.
Response:  We know that Paul received 531 pens as gifts for his last day of school. Since he returned 38 pens, we have 503 pens left (531 - 38 = 503). Now, we are asked how many pens Paul has left after returning 399 pens. To find out, we need to subtract 399 from 503, which gives us 104 pens left (503 - 399 = 104). So, Paul has 104 pens left.
Response:  We know that Paul received 601 pens as a gift for his last year of school and he returned 336 pens, leaving him with 265 pens. If we subtract one pen from 265, we get 264 pens left. Therefore, the answer is 264.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul received 291 pens as his birthday gift and he spent or gave away 35 of them before school ended. So, the number of pens Paul has left is 291 - 35 = 256 pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received 267 pieces of paper as birthday gifts from his classmates in one year. Then, he threw away 231 pieces of pencils, which means he has 308 more pencils than the number of papers he received. Therefore, the difference between the number of pencils he lost and the number of papers he received is 308 - 231 = 77.
Response:  We know that Paul received 457 pieces of candy and he gave away 320 sticks. So, the number of remaining candies is:  Number of remaining candies = Total number of candies - Number of given away candies = 457 - 320 = 137 Now, we are asked how many sticks Paul has left after giving away 523 sticks. To find out, we need to subtract the number of sticks given away from the total number of sticks: Number of sticks left = Total number of sticks - Number of given away sticks = 137 - 523 = -386 Therefore, Paul has -386 sticks left after giving away 523 sticks.
Response:  After three people left, there were ten customers remaining (including the attendant). So, the number of customers after they left was nine (10 - 3 = 9). Now, let's compare this to the original number of customers before any customer left: eleven (including the attendant). Therefore, the difference between the number of customers after some customers left and the original number of customers is eight (eleven - nine = 8).
Response:  The service staff has three customers who leave after using the restroom. Then, there are four people returning to the restaurant. To determine if the number of customers leaving is greater than the number of people returning, we need to compare these two numbers. So, let's calculate them separately: Customers Leaving = 3 Customers Returning = 4 Now, we can see that the number of customers leaving (3) is less than the number of customers returning (4), so the answer is Yes, the number of customers leaving is greater than the number of people returning.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers (including the one who left). After the first customer left, there were 8 customers remaining. Then, another customer left, leaving 7 customers. Finally, there were 6 customers remaining. So, initially, there were 9 customers.
Response:  We know that there are initially 14 customers in the waiting area. If five customers leave, then we have 14 - 5 = 9 customers left in the waiting area. So, there are currently 9 customers remaining in the waiting area.
Response:  Firstly, there are 13 customers initially. Then, the service staff brings in 4 new customers, so the total number of customers becomes 13 + 4 = 17. Finally, there are 9 customers left after some customers leave, so the remaining customers are 9. Therefore, the answer is 9 - 13 = -4.
Response:  Firstly, there are 12 original customers. Then, 15 new customers arrive, so the total number of customers is now 12 + 15 = 27. Finally, the attendant brings in another 14 new customers, making the total number of customers 27 + 14 = 41. Therefore, there are 41 customers in total.
Response:  The service staff has three customers initially. If there are more than one customer for over an hour, then there will be eight customers in total (including the original three). So, the number of new customers is 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are initially 8 customers (including the attendant). Then, after some of them left, there were 5 remaining customers. Finally, 99 new customers joined, so the total number of customers now is 5 + 99 = 104. Therefore, the number of customers who remained after all the new customers joined is 104 - 8 = 96.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 12 guests who left after having dinner. Then, 14 more people arrived later. Finally, 10 new customers came in. So, the total number of guests at the restaurant is:  Initially 12 + Later 14 = Total 26 guests.
Response:  At first, Danny paid $2 for a candy. So he had $2 - $2 = $0 left. Then he got $3 back. Therefore, at the end, he had $0 + $3 = $3.
Response:  If Dan has $40 and buys a candy that costs $3, then he will have $37 left ($40 - $3 = $37). Now, if he buys another candy that costs $2, he will have $35 left ($37 - $2 = $35). So, there are 3 candies in total (($37 / $2) = 3).
Response:  If Dan has $40 and buys 99 pieces of candy each worth $3, then he will spend a total of: $$ = \times = $ So, Dan has spent $276 on the candy.
Response:  If Dan has $3 and buys two pieces of candy that cost $4 each, then he will spend a total of $8 (2 x $4). So, the price of one piece of candy is $8 / 2 = $4.
Response:  If Dan has $20 and he buys 3 pieces of candy that cost $6 each, then he will have spent $18 (3 x $6 = $18). So, he still has $2 ($20 - $18 = $2) left after buying the candy. Now, if he buys another piece of candy that costs $3, he will spend the remaining $2 he had left ($2), so now he has zero money left ($20 - $2 = $0). Therefore, Dan bought 3 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  First, Dan spent $7 on one piece of candy that cost $2 per piece. So, he spent $7 / 2 = $3.50 on that candy. Then, he spent $3.50 on another piece of chocolate that cost $3 per piece. So, he spent $3.50 + $3 = $6.50 in total. Therefore, Dan has $7 - $6.50 = $0.50 left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $40 and he bought a piece of sugar cane worth $7. So, he spent $7/4 = $1.75 on the sugar cane. Next, he bought another piece of sugar cane worth $6. So, he spent $6/4 = $1.50 on this second piece of sugar cane. Therefore, in total, Dan spent $1.75 + $1.50 = $3.25 to buy both pieces of sugar cane.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Dan bought a piece of chocolate for $6 and another one for $3. So he spent a total of $9 (6 + 3). Therefore, the answer is $9.
Response:  Firstly, Dan bought one piece of candy for $2. Then he bought another piece of chocolate for $3. So far, he has spent a total of $5 (2 + 3). Therefore, when he bought the cookie, he spent $5 - $2 = $3.
Response:  Firstly, Dan has $40. Then he buys a piece of candy worth $8. So now he has $40 - $8 = $32 left. Next, his friends give him $5 more, so he has $32 + $5 = $37 now.
Response:  If he has $4 initially and spends $3 on each of the three candies, then he will have $4 - $3 = $1 left after buying all three candies. So, the cost of each candy is $3 / 3 = $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $40 in US dollars and wants to buy 10 pieces of tea with each piece costing $30. So, he needs to spend $30 x 10 = $300 in total. Therefore, he will have $40 - $300 = $-260 left after buying the tea.
Response:  If Dan has $3 and buys two candies for $4 each, then he will have spent all of his money. So, the cost of one candy is $4 / 2 = $2. Therefore, each candy costs $2.
Response:  Dan has $50 and buys $30 worth of tea leaves. Then he spends $20 on chocolates. So far, he has spent a total of $50 + $30 = $80. Now, he wants to buy more chocolates. If he buys $10 worth of chocolates, then he will have spent a total of $80 + $10 = $90. Therefore, the amount that Dan will spend on chocolates is $90.
Response:  Firstly, Dan bought a chocolate bar for $7. Then he bought a bag of candies for $2. So far, Dan has spent a total of $9 (7 + 2).
Response:  We know that Paul has 115 books and he sells 78 of them. So, we need to find out how many books are left with him. To do this, we can divide the total number of books (115) by the number of books sold (78). This gives us the remaining number of books: 115 / 78 = 1.5. Therefore, there are 15 more books left with Paul than the ones he sold.
Response:  At first, Paul had 200 books. He sold 137 cars and was left with 105 books. So, initially, Paul had 200 - 137 = 63 books.
Response:  Paul had 108 books and sold some of them to his friend. After selling, he was left with 35 books. Then, he returned 62 books to his friend. So, the number of books that Paul sold is: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Remaining books after returning = 108 - 35 + 62 = 75 books. Therefore, Paul sold 75 books to his friend.
Response:  We know that Paul has 50 books and he buys one car selling place after finishing all of them. So, he has 50 - 1 = 49 books left. Now we are asked how many books Paul bought. Since he has 49 books left, he must have bought at least 49 books. Therefore, the answer is 49.
"Response:  Paul initially had two books and later sold some of them to buy new ones at $150 each. If he now has 58 books in total, then he must have sold x books originally. Since he bought y new books, we can set up the equation:
x + y = 58... (1)
Since he sold 30 books, we know that x - 30 = 28 is true. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:
y = 28... (2)
So Paul bought 28 new books."
Response:  If Paul has 21 books and sells them for $40 each, he will get $840 in total ($21 x $40). Then, if he buys 42 new books at $30 each, he will spend $1260 ($42 x $30). So, the difference between what he sold his old books for and how much he spent on the new ones is $420 ($840 - $1260). Therefore, he has 15 books left after selling his old ones and buying the new ones.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul sold 71 books in the car auction and bought 38 new cars with the money he earned from selling those books. Therefore, the total amount of money Paul earned from selling the 71 books is $71 x 50% = $35.50. Now, let's calculate how many books Paul can buy with this amount of money. We know that each book costs $116, so the number of books Paul can buy is $35.50 / $116 = 0.304 or approximately 3 books. So, Paul can buy 3 books with the money he earned from selling the 71 books.
Response:  Paul has 108 books and 55 pens. If he sells each book for $20 and uses one pen to sign each book, then he will have $1080 in revenue from selling books ($20 x 55) and $55 in expenses (the cost of signing each book with one pen). After selling 66 books, he will have $660 in revenue ($20 x 33) and $55 in expenses, leaving him with $1105 ($660 + $55). Therefore, he sold 33 more books after selling 66 books.
Response:  Paul has 51 books and 106 pens. If he sells each book for $30 and each pen for $2, then his total revenue is:  Book sales: 51 x $30 = $1530 Pens sales: 106 x $2 = $212 Total revenue: $1742 Now, let's find out how many books and pens Paul has left after selling them. Books sold: $1530 / $30 per book = 51 books remaining Pens sold: $212 / $2 per pen = 106 pens remaining So, Paul has 82 books and 14 pens left after selling them at the car boot sale.
Response:  At first, Paul had 136 books and sold 27 of them at the auction. So he has 109 books left (136 - 27 = 109). Now we need to find out how many books he sold initially. To do this, we can divide the number of books he had at first by the number of books he sold: 109 books / 27 books = 4.14 books per book sold.
Response: 波爾 (Polly) has 134 books and sells 39 of them to her friends for $39 each. After selling the books, she is left with 68 books. To find out how many books Polly sold, we can divide the number of books she had after selling ($68) by the price per book ($39): $68 / $39 = 17.5 books. So, Polly sold 17.5 books.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul has 95 pens and he sold 153 books using those pens. After selling those books, he had 13 pens left with 23 pens remaining. So, if we want to know how many books Paul sold, we can use the following equation: Number of books sold = Remaining pens / Pens used per book To solve for number of books sold, we need to find out how many pens are used in each book. Since there are 95 pens in total, and Paul sold 153 books, the number of pens used per book is: (Number of books sold) x (Pens used per book) = 153 x 95 = 14,075 Now, we can plug this value into our original equation: Number of books sold = Remaining pens / Pens used per book = 13 / 14,075 = 86 books Therefore, Paul sold 86 books.
Response:  Paul has 42 pens and wrote 143 books with each pen. If he sells some of his books and returns 113 books and 19 pens, we can calculate the number of pens sold as follows: Number of pens sold = Total number of pens - Returned number of pens = 42 - 113 = 71 pens So, Paul sold 71 pens at the auction.
Response:  Jessica cut eight flowers from the garden and put them in the vase. So, initially there were ten flowers in the vase (since that was how many were already inside). Then, she added eight more flowers, so now there are eighteen flowers in total (ten + eight = eighteen). Therefore, there are eighteen flowers in the vase right now.
Response:  Jessica cut 16 flowers from the garden and put them in the vase. The vase already had 23 flowers inside. So, initially there were 49 flowers (16 + 23) in the vase.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica threw away four flowers from the vase. So, initially, there were 20 flowers in the vase (23 - 4 = 20). Then, she picked some new flowers from her garden and put them into the vase. However, since she didn't specify how many new flowers she picked, let's assume it was an even number (e.g., 6 or 8) for simplicity. Therefore, after putting the new flowers into the vase, there would be 14 flowers left (20 - 6 = 14). So, the final answer is 14.
Response:  Firstly, there are 15 flowers in the vase initially. Then, Jessica throws away 33 flowers from the vase and picks new ones from her garden to put into the vase. So, the number of new flowers added is 33 - 15 = 18. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase now is 17 + 18 = 35.
Response:  Jessica took out 34 flowers from the vase and then cut 15 new ones from the garden to replace them. So, the total number of flowers in the vase after Jessica's actions is: 34 + 15 = 49. Therefore, there are 49 flowers in the vase now.
Response:  Jessica picked more flowers from her garden, and there were 7 flowers in each pot. So, she picked a total of 7 x 20 = 140 flowers.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jessica picked more flowers from her garden and put them in the vase. The original number of flowers in the vase was 13, and after she added more, there were 12 new flowers. So, the total number of flowers in the vase now is 13 + 12 = 25. Since the problem states that there are 21 flowers in the garden, we can conclude that there are 6 (21 - 25) fewer flowers in the garden than in the vase. Therefore, the number of flowers in the garden is 6.
Response:  We know that there are 15 flowers in each of the 62 species of flowers in the vase. So, if Jessica picked more than 15 flowers from the garden, then she must have picked at least 15 x 62 = 930 flowers in total. Since there are also 17 types of roses and 96 roses in total, Jessica must have picked at least 930 + 17 = 947 flowers in total. Therefore, Jessica cut off 947 flowers.
"Response:  Jessica picked more than ten flowers from the garden, and there were twelve flowers in each of the two vases she brought back. So, the total number of flowers Jessica picked is:

12 x 2 = 24 flowers

Now, let's count the number of lantern flowers among them:

Out of the 24 flowers, 10 are not lantern flowers (since they are already accounted for). Therefore, the number of lantern flowers Jessica picked is:

24 - 10 = 14 lantern flowers"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five flowers in total in the vase, and three of them are lilies (兰花). So, the number of non-lily flowers is five - three = two.  Therefore, there are two types of flowers other than lilies in the vase.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are seven types of flowers in total, and each type has ten stems (i.e., 7 x 10 = 70). Now, let's consider how many stems Jessica picked from the garden. According to the question, she picked more than seventy stems of flowers. So, the number of stems Jessica picked is greater than 70. Therefore, the answer is 71 or more.
Response:  If there are 19 flowers in total and initially there are 3 flowers in each of the 6 vases, then the number of flowers cut from the garden is: $ Number of vases = 6$  Initially, each vase has $3$ flowers, so the total number of flowers in all vases is: $Total number of flowers = 6 \times 3 = 18$  Now, Jessica cuts $X$ flowers from the garden. Since she puts $X$ flowers into each of the $6$ vases, the number of flowers left in the garden after cutting is: $Number of flowers left = Total number of flowers - (6 \times X) = 18 - (6 \times X)$  Therefore, the answer is $X = 12$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 flowers in the first vase and 84 flowers in the second vase. So, if Jessica picks more than 13 flowers from the first vase, she will have fewer flowers left in the vase compared to before. Similarly, if she picks less than 84 flowers from the second vase, she will have fewer flowers left in the vase compared to before. Therefore, the maximum number of flowers Jessica can cut is 84 - 13 = 71.
Response:  There are 16 flowers in total, including 3 lilies and 13 roses. Since Jessica picked more than she left behind, let's assume she picked x roses. Then, there will be x + 3 lilies left in the vase. So, the number of roses picked is x.
Response:  We know that there are six identical lilies in the vase and twenty-two identical roses. So, if we want to find out how many more lilies there are than roses, we can subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers in the vase.  Therefore, the answer is: 6 - 22 = -16.  So, there are six more lilies than roses in the vase.
Response:  We know that there are 9 identical flowers in each pot and 6 pots in total. Therefore, the total number of identical flowers is: 9 x 6 = 54. Now, we need to find out how many different flowers there are in total. According to the problem statement, there are 13 non-identical flowers in one pot, and 3 pots have these flowers. So, the total number of different flowers is: 13 x 3 = 39. Therefore, the final answer is: 54 + 39 = 93.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's hair is currently 17 inches long. If he cuts off 3 inches of his hair, how many inches will be left? Therefore, the length of Robin's remaining hair = 17 - 3 = 14 inches. Now, if Robin had 13 inches of hair before cutting, and he cut off 3 inches, then the length of his remaining hair after cutting = 13 - 3 = 10 inches. So, Robin cut off 3 inches of his hair.
Response:  If Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair and it was previously long to begin with (let's say 10 inches), then we can calculate how much longer it used to be as follows: New length - Original length = 20 - 10 = 10 inches So, before cutting, Robin's hair was 10 inches longer than it is now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin cut off 30 cm of his leg hair. Then, he grew it back to 12 inches (or 30 cm). So, the length of Robin's head hair is equal to the original length minus the length of his grown-back leg hair. Therefore, the answer is:  Head hair length = Original length - Grown-back leg hair length = 16 cm - 30 cm = -14 cm
Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 19 inches long and he wants to know how much longer it will be if he grows it an additional 18 inches, we can use simple arithmetic to calculate this. So, if his current length is 19 inches, and he adds 18 inches, his new length would be: New Length = Current Length + Additional Length = 19 inches + 18 inches = 37 inches Therefore, Robin's head of hair will grow by 18 inches if he grows it an additional 18 inches from its current length of 19 inches.
Response:  If Robin cut off three inches of his hair, and he had 14 inches of hair before cutting, then we can calculate how many inches of hair he has now as follows:  Before cutting = 14 inches After cutting = 3 inches - 3 = 10 inches So, Robin has 10 inches of hair left after cutting it.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's hair was originally 14 inches long. Then, it increased in width by 20 millimeters, which is equivalent to 0.8 inches or 20 mm. Finally, he cut off 20 inches of his hair. So, how long is Robin's hair now? To calculate this, we need to subtract the increase in width from the original length: Length after cutting = Original length - Increase in width = 14 inches - 0.8 inches = 13.2 inches Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 13.2 inches long.
Response:  We know that there are 12 bottle caps in total and Dan found 53 of them in the park. So, we can calculate the number of bottle caps left at home as follows: Number of bottle caps left at home = Total number of bottle caps - Number of bottle caps found in the park = 12 - 53 = -41 Therefore, Dan has 41 more bottle caps at home than he found in the park.
Response:  We know that there are 21 bottle caps in total and Dan found 7 of them in the park. So, the number of bottle caps left is 21 - 7 = 14. Now we need to find out how many bottle caps Dan picked up from the park. Since he found 7 bottle caps, it means he picked up 7/5 = 1.4 bottle caps per day (approximately). Therefore, if Dan picks up bottle caps for 5 days, he will have collected 1.4 x 5 = 7 bottle caps in total.
Response:  At first, Danny had 33 bottle caps. Then he found 63 more bottle caps in the park and threw away 51 of them. So, how many bottle caps does Danny have now? We can calculate it as follows:  Initially, Danny had 33 bottle caps + (found in the park) = 63 - (thrown away) = 33 + 63 = 96 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny has 96 bottle caps now.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 bottle caps in the park and he already had 35 old bottles. So, the total number of bottle caps he has is 36 + 35 = 71. Now, we are asked how many bottle caps Danny found in the park. Since he found 22 bottle caps, the answer is 71 - 22 = 49. Therefore, Danny found 49 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 lids and there were 63 old bottles in total. So, we can calculate the number of lids left after Danny collected them as follows:  Number of lids left = Total number of lids - Number of lids collected by Danny = 63 - 30 = 33 lids. Therefore, Danny collected 42 lids out of the 63 total lids.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 22 bottle caps and 8 paper bags.  Each bottle cap represents one container, so there are 22 containers in total.  Since each container has two parts - the bottle cap and the box packaging, we need to double the number of containers to get the total number of items collected by Danny. Therefore, the total number of items collected by Danny is:  22 x 2 = 44 items.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 22 bottle caps and 30 paper bags.  Since each bottle cap is equivalent to 1 piece of packaging material, we can infer that Danny has collected 22 pieces of packaging material (bottle caps). Similarly, since each paper bag is equivalent to 1 piece of packaging material, we can infer that Danny has collected 30 pieces of packaging material (paper bags). Therefore, the total number of pieces of packaging material collected by Danny is 22 + 30 = 52 pieces. So, Danie had initially 52 packages.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 bottle caps and 14 paper bags.  Since each bottle cap is equivalent to 2 paper bags (as there are 7 bottle caps for every 14 paper bags), we can conclude that Danny collected 30 x 2 = 60 paper bags. Therefore, the number of paper bags Danny collected is 86 - 60 = 26. So, Danny collected 26 paper bags at the park.
"Response:  We know that Danny collected 11 bottle caps and 28 paper bags in the park.  Since each bottle cap is equivalent to 6 bottles (since there are 6 bottle caps for every 1 bottle), we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottle caps / Number of bottles per cap
= 11 / 6
= 1.83
Since there are 28 paper bags for every 1.83 bottles, we can calculate the total number of paper bags as follows:

Total number of paper bags = Total number of bottles x Number of paper bags per bottle
= 1.83 x 4
= 7.32
Therefore, Danny collected 732 paper bags in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny has collected 71 bottle caps and 24 pieces of paper labels.  Each bottle cap can be used to cover one bottle, so there are 71 bottles covered in total.  Now, let's count how many packages Danny has. According to the problem, each package contains 16 bottle caps. Therefore, the number of packages is:

$$ \boxed{71 \div 16 = 4} $$
So, Danny has 4 packages of bottle caps."
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 10 bottle caps and 62 paper bags.  Each bottle cap is worth 2 pieces of packaging material (paper bag), so there are 20 bottle caps x 2 = 40 pieces of packaging material in total. Therefore, the number of paper bags Danny has collected is 62 - 40 = 22 pieces.
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 bottle caps. He threw away 41 of them in the park, so he had 25 left. Therefore, Danny started with 25 bottle caps.
Response:  If Danny collected 32 bottle caps before he went to the park and then collected 25 more bottle caps at the park, how many bottle caps did Danny collect in total?  To find out, we can simply add the number of bottle caps Danny collected before he went to the park (32) to the number of bottle caps he collected at the park (25):  Total = 32 + 25 = 57 So, Danny collected 57 bottle caps in total.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 old paper clips and 58 new paper clips. Since he had 67 pieces of collection in total, we can deduce that he initially had x - 60 = 67 - 58 = 9 extra old paper clips. Therefore, Danny initially had 9 old paper clips.
Response:  If Danny threw away 6 old bottle caps and found 50 new ones, then he has a total of 60 bottle caps now (including both old and new ones). So, the number of bottle caps that Danny collected in the park is 60 - 6 = 54.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 old paper clips and found 48 new ones. So, the total number of paper clips he collected is 54 + 48 = 102. Now, we are asked how many paper clips Danny left behind in the park. Since he took away 52 paper clips from the park, the number of paper clips he left behind is 102 - 52 = 50. Therefore, the answer is 50.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 82 paper bags and 29 plastic bottle caps.  Since each plastic bottle cap can be used to cover one paper bag, we have: Number of plastic bottle caps = Total number of paper bags / Number of plastic bottles covered per cap = 82 / (29/1) = 82 x 3 = 256 plastic bottle caps. Therefore, Danny had initially 256 plastic bottle caps.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 66 paper bags and 39 plastic bottle caps. Since each bag can hold 68 pieces of plastic bottle caps, we can calculate the total number of plastic bottles that Danny has collected as follows: Number of plastic bottles = Total number of paper bags x Capacity of each paper bag (68 pieces)Total number of plastic bottle caps = Total number of paper bags x Capacity of each paper bag (68 pieces)So, the answer is 66 x 68 = 4272 plastic bottles.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 paper bags and 50 plastic bottle caps. Since each paper bag can hold 5 plastic bottle caps, we have: Number of paper bags = 46 / 5 = 9.2 (round up to 10) Number of plastic bottle caps = 50 So, the number of plastic bottle caps Danny collected is 50. Therefore, the answer is 50.
"Response:  We know that Danny collected 65 paper bags and 5 plastic bottle caps.  Since each bag can hold 20 pieces of trash, we have:

Number of bags = 65 x 20 = 1300 pieces of trash

Since each cap can hold 4 pieces of trash, we have:

Number of caps = 5 x 4 = 20 pieces of trash

So, in total, Danny collected 1300 + 20 = 1320 pieces of trash."
Response:  We know that there are 58 bottle caps and 25 paper bags in total. Since each bottle cap is equivalent to 4 paper bags (since we have 4 bottles for each bag), we can write an equation as follows:  Number of bottle caps = Number of paper bags x Number of bottles per bag  In this case, the number of bottles per bag is 4, so we can substitute it into the previous equation:  Number of bottle caps = Number of paper bags x 4  Now, let's solve for the number of bottle caps:  Number of bottle caps = 58  Number of paper bags = 58 / 4  Number of paper bags = 14  Therefore, Dan has more than 14 bottle caps than packaging boxes.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 15 bottle caps and 18 paper bags.  Each bottle cap can be used to make one plastic bag, so we have 15 x 1 = 15 plastic bags made from bottle caps. Therefore, the total number of plastic bags is 15 + 18 = 33. Since each plastic bag has 67 labels, the total number of labels is 33 x 67 = 2249. So, Danie's collection contains 2249 labels.
Response:  According to the question, Jake has 17 cherries and Steve has fewer than 11 cherries. So, we can say that Steve has x number of cherries, where x is less than or equal to 11. Now, we know that Jake has 17 more cherries than Steve, so Jake has 17 + x = 28 cherries in total. Therefore, the answer is 28.
"Response:  According to the question, Jake has fewer than 7 plums, and Steven has more than 14 plums. So, if we assume that Jake has x plums, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
x < 7... (1)
Steven has 14 more plums than Jake, so we can write another equation:
x + 14 = Steven's number of plums... (2)
Now, let's solve for x using substitution or elimination method. Since there are two equations and one variable, we will use substitution method here. Solving Equation (1), we get:
x = 9
Now, substituting this value into Equation (2), we get:
9 + 14 = Steven's number of plums
13 = Steven's number of plums
Therefore, Jake has 9 plums."
Response:  According to the question, Jake has fewer than 18 cherries, and Steven has more than 13 cherries. So, there are at least 18 - 13 = 5 cherries that Steven has but Jake does not have. Now, let's consider the total number of cherries owned by all three people. According to the question, Jake owns x cherries, Steven owns y cherries (where y > x), and Jill owns z cherries (where z is a positive integer). Since Jill has more cherries than Jake, we can write x < y. Moreover, since Steven has more cherries than both Jake and Jill, we can write y > x + z. Therefore, the total number of cherries owned by all three people is given by: x + y + z = 19 + 13 + 5 = 47. So, Jill has 47 - x = 47 - 5 = 42 cherries.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 more pears than Steven, so Jake has 3 + x = 10 pears, where x is the number of pears Steven has. Since Steven has fewer pears than Jill, we can say that Steven has x - 8 = 2 pears. Now, let's find out how many pears Jake has compared to Jill. So, Jake has 3 + x - 8 = 15 pears more than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 15 - x = 7 pears more than Jill.
Response:  According to the question, Jake has 12 fewer plums than Steven. So, if Steven has x plums, then Jake has x - 12 plums.  Similarly, according to the second part of the question, Steven has 11 more plums than Jill. So, if Jill has y plums, then Steven has y + 11 plums.  Now, we are given that Stephen has four plums. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:  x - 12 = y + 11  Substituting the value of x from the first part of the question (x = 30), we get: 30 - 12 = y + 11  Solving for y, we get:  y = 18  Therefore, Jill has 18 plums more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 more pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 7 pears.  Moreover, Jake has more pears than Jill by 9 pears. Therefore, Jake has x + 9 = 25 pears.  Thus, Jake has 25 pears.
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Jake has fewer than 7 plums than Steven.
Jake has more than 8 plums than Jill.
So, if Jake has x plums, then Steven has x - 7 plums and Jill has x + 8 plums.
We can write an equation based on this information:
x = (Steven's plums) - (Jake's plums)
Substituting the values given in the problem:
x = (10) - (Jake's plums)
Now we need to find out how many plums Jake has. So, we are asked to solve for Jake's plums.
Solving the equation, we get:
Jake has 3 plums.
Therefore, Jill has 3 + 8 = 11 plums."
Response:  According to the question, Jake has fewer than 9 plums. So, he must have exactly 9 - x plums where x is a positive integer. Similarly, Steven has more than 18 plums and less than or equal to 27 plums (since Jill has 18 + 3 = 21 plums). Therefore, Steven has at least 27 - x plums where x is a positive integer. Now we can find out how many plums Steven has by solving the inequality: 27 - x > 18...(1) Since x is a positive integer, we know that x >= 0. Substituting this value in equation (1), we get: 27 > 18 + 0...(2) Solving for x, we get: x = 9  Therefore, Steven has 9 plums more than Jake.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake has fewer than 6 plums than Steven. So, if Steven has x plums, then Jake has x - 6 plums.  Moreover, Stephen has more plums than Jill, who has 5 plums. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + (x - 6) = 18  Simplifying the above equation, we get: 2x = 18  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we obtain:  x = 9  Hence, Jake has 9 plums less than Steven.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake has fewer than 5 apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples, then Jake has x - 5 apples.  Moreover, Steve has more apples than Jill. Therefore, Jake has fewer apples than both Steven and Jill combined.  Now, let's use algebra to solve for x.  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven, so we can write an equation based on this information:  Jake's apples = Steven's apples - 5  Next, we know that Steve has more apples than Jill, so we can write another equation based on this information:  Steve's apples > Jill's apples  Finally, we want to find out how many apples Jake has relative to both Steven and Jill. So, we set up our third equation using these two inequalities:  Jake's apples < (Steve's apples + Jill's apples)  Solving for x, we get:  Jake's apples = 82 apples  Therefore, Jake has 82 apples fewer than both Steven and Jill combined.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, we have:

* Jake has 16 more cherries than Steven. So, if Steven has x cherries, then Jake has x + 16 cherries.
* Jill has 12 cherries less than Jake. So, if Jake has x + 16 cherries, then Jill has x - 12 cherries.

Now, let's find out how many cherries Jill has:

x - 12 =? (since Jill has x - 12 cherries)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 38 (cherries)

So, Jill has 38 cherries. To summarize:

Jake has 44 cherries (x + 16).
Steven has x cherries (less than 44).
Jill has 38 cherries (less than both Jake and Steven)."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 12 apples. Also, we know that Jake has more pears than Steven. So, if Jake has y pears, then Steven has y - 79 pears. Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the question: Jake has 35 pears and 14 apples, so he has 35 + 14 = 49 fruits in total. Therefore, Jake has 49 / (x + 12) = 49 / (y - 79) fruits. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 16 and y = 80. So, Jake has 16 apples and 80 pears.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake has fewer plums than Steven. Specifically, Jake has 13 fewer plums than Steven. So, if Steven has x plums of plums, then Jake has x - 13 plums of plums. Similarly, both Jake and Steven have 3 apples each. Therefore, Jake has 9 apples in total (3 + (x - 13)).
Response:  According to the problem, Jake has 6 fewer plums than Steven and 8 more fruits than Steven. So, if we compare Jake with Stephen, Jake has 6 + 8 = 14 more fruits than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 17 - 14 = 3 more plums than Stephen.
"Response:  According to the problem, Jake has three fewer apricots than Steven and more apples than him. So, if Steven has x apricots and y apples, then Jake has x - 3 apricots and y + 3 apples. Since both boys have a total of 12 apricots and 15 apples, we can set up the following equation:
x + (y + 3) = 12... (1)
Simplifying Equation (1), we get:
y + 3 = 9
Now, we know that Jake has 9 apples more than Steven. Therefore, the value of y is:
y = 6
So, the number of apples Steven has is:
y = 6
And the number of apricots Steven has is:
x = 9
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Steven has 6 apples and 9 apricots."
Response:  According to the problem statement: 史蒂文 (Steven) has 12 balls.  Jake has fewer than 12 balls.  So, Jake has x balls.  Since Steven has 12 balls and Jake has fewer than 12 balls, we can say that Steven has 12 - x balls more than Jake.  Now, let's consider Jill.  According to the problem statement, Jill has 67 balls more than Steven.  Therefore, Jill has 67 + (12 - x) = 67 + 10 = 77 balls.  So, Jake has 10 balls.
Response:  According to the problem statement: 史蒂文 (Steven) has 18 cherries and Jake has fewer than 18 cherries.  Moreover, Steven has more cherries than Jill. So, we can conclude that Jill has x number of cherries, where x is the difference between Steven's number of cherries and Jake's number of cherries.  Therefore, Jill has 8 + 10 = 18 cherries.
Response:  According to the problem statement, we know that:  * Steven has 19 balls (the given information).  * Jake has fewer than 19 balls (since he is compared to Steven and has fewer balls).  * Jill has more than 12 balls (since she is compared to Jake and has more balls). So, let's use this information to solve for how many balls Jake has: We can start by subtracting the number of balls that Jake has from the total number of balls that Steven has: 19 - X = 12 + 72 (where X represents the number of balls that Jake has) Solving for X, we get: X = 45 Now, since Jake has fewer balls than Steven, we know that X must be less than or equal to 19. Therefore, the answer is: Jake has between 0 and 18 balls.
Response:  According to the problem statement, we know that Jake has 14 cherries and he is missing 6 cherries compared to Steven. So, Steven must have 20 cherries (14 - 6 = 8). Now, we are told that Jill has more than Steven but fewer than Jake. This means that Jill has x cherries where x is between 8 and 14 (inclusive). Therefore, Jill has 11 cherries (x - 6 = 5).
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 84 fruits and fewer than 10 plums. So, we can say that Jake has x fruit(s). Since Steve has 52 fruits including 13 plums, we can write an equation as follows:  X + 10 = 52  Now, let's solve for X.  To do this, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:  X = 42  Therefore, Jake has 42 fruits in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So, Jake has 13 more apples than Steve. Therefore, Jake has 13 + 12 = 25 apples in total.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake has 8 fewer plums than Steven. So, if Steven has x plums, Jake has x - 8 = 2x plums.  Now, we are told that Stephen has 11 fruits more than Jake. Therefore, if Jake has 2x plums, Stephen has 2x + 11 = 3x + 11 fruits.  Since both Jake and Stephen have fruit and plum, we can write an equation based on their total number of fruits and plums:  Total fruits = 2x + 11 + 10 (Stephen) + 2x (Jake) = 3x + 21  Substituting x = 10, we get:  Total fruits = 3(10) + 21 = 30 fruits  Therefore, Stephen has 30 more fruits than Jake.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake has three more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has x -3 apples, then we can write an equation as follows:  Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, so their total number of apples is equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  Now, let's consider the fruit part of the problem. According to the problem statement, Steven has 15 fruits and Jake has 22 fruits. So, we can write another equation as follows:  Subtracting the two equations, we get:  Solving for Jake's number of fruits, we get:  Therefore, Jake has 7 more fruits than Steven.
Response:  If Oliva has $78 in her wallet and she bought $15 worth of goods at the supermarket, then we can calculate how much money is left as follows: $78 - $15 = $63 So there are $63 left after buying goods at the supermarket.
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and then returned $33, initially she had how much money?  To find out, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount of money she had: $78 - $33 = $45 Initially, Olivia had $45.
Response:  Firstly, Oliva withdrew $148 from an ATM. Then she went to the supermarket and spent $159. So, the amount of money Oliva spent at the supermarket is $159 - $148 = $11. Therefore, Oliva spent $11 more than she withdrew from the ATM.
Response:  Firstly, there are $30 in cash inside the wallet. Then, he withdrew another $49 from the ATM. So, the total amount of money he has is $79 ($30 + $49). Now, let's compare it to the money he spent at the supermarket. He spent $49 at the supermarket, which means he has $30 left after buying things at the supermarket. Therefore, the difference between the money he had and the money he spent is $30 - $49 = $-19.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva withdrew $91 from an ATM and then went to the supermarket. We also know that there were $14 more bills in his wallet than he had at the ATM. Therefore, the total amount of money Oliva had was: $91 + ($14 - $53) = $108. So, Oliva spent more money at the supermarket than he had at the ATM.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are $106 in the wallet and after buying something at the mall, she has $26 left. Then, she spent $49 at the exhibition hall. So, the amount of money she spent at the supermarket is: $26 - $49 = $-23. Therefore, she spent negative $23 at the supermarket.
Response:  After Olivia went to the supermarket and spent $29, she had $54 left in her wallet initially. So, she spent $\frac{29}{54} = \boxed{0.53}$ of her initial money.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  If Dave has 19 applications installed on his phone and he removes 5 of them, then he is left with 14 applications. So, there are 14 applications installed on Dave's phone after he removed 5 of them.
Response:  If there are currently 18 applications installed on the phone and then 5 more are added, that means in total there are now 23 applications installed on the phone (18 + 5 = 23).
Response:  At first, Dave had ten applications on his phone. Then he added 11 more applications, so now he has 21 applications in total (ten + eleven = twenty-one). To find out how many applications are left after deleting four, we need to subtract four from twenty-one: twenty-one - four = seventeen. So, after deleting four applications, Dave is left with seventeen applications on his phone.
Response:  Firstly, Dave had 21 applications on his phone. Then he added 89 more applications, which brings the total to 106 (21 + 89). Next, he removed some of the applications, leaving him with 24 applications. Finally, he added even more applications, bringing the total number to 35 (24 + x), where x is an unknown quantity. So, the final answer is 35.
"Response:  Firstly, Dave had 15 apps on his phone before he added 71 new ones. So, the total number of apps on his phone now is 15 + 71 = 86 apps.  Next, we are asked to subtract some letters from this total number. Specifically, we need to subtract 14 letters (the difference between ""Dave"" and ""David""). Therefore, the number of apps that Dave actually deleted is 86 - 14 = 72 apps. Finally, we are asked how many more apps David added after deleting those 72 apps. The answer is simply 71 - 72 = -1 app. So, David added 1 fewer app than he deleted."
Response:  We know that there are 16 applications and 77 files in total. To find out how many applications have more than 5 files, we can divide the number of files by 5: 77 / 5 = 15. So, there are 15 applications with more than 5 files. Now, let's count the remaining applications: 16 - 15 = 1. Therefore, there is one application left with fewer than 5 files.
Response:  We know that there are 17 applications and 21 files in total.  To find out how many applications and files are left after removing three applications and seven files, we can use subtraction.  So, the number of remaining applications is 17 - 3 = 14, and the number of remaining files is 21 - 7 = 14. Therefore, the answer to the question is 14 applications and 14 files.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 applications installed on the phone.  Each application may have multiple files associated with it, such as code, resources, and data.  Therefore, the total number of files on the phone is at least 15 x (number of files per application).  Since each file has a name, let's assume that each file has an average length of 8 characters (including spaces).  So, the total number of characters in all the files on the phone is at least 15 x (average file length) x (total number of files).  Now, we need to calculate the total number of bytes in all the files on the phone.  One byte is equal to 8 bits, so the total number of bytes is equal to the total number of characters multiplied by 8.  Finally, we can convert the number of bytes to megabytes by dividing it by 1,048,576 (the number of bytes in one megabyte).  Therefore, the answer is approximately 21 MB.
Response:  We know that there are 19 applications installed on Dave's phone and 18 files. So, we have a total of 37 items (19 apps + 18 files). Now, let's assume that six applications and ten files remain after deleting three applications and fifteen files, respectively. Therefore, the number of applications remaining is six, and the number of files remaining is ten. Hence, the answer is 37 - 6 = 31 applications and 10 - 15 = 5 files.
Response:  If Dave has 17 apps installed on his phone and he adds one more app, then he has 18 apps in total.  So, the answer is 18.
"Response:  We know that there are 59 files in total and 15 applications. So, we have:

File count = 59
Application count = 15

Now, let's find out how many files each application has:

Application 1 has 7 files (since it is listed as having 7 files).
Application 2 has 4 files (since it is listed as having 4 files).
...
Application n has x files (where n is the number of applications minus 1).

So, for example, Application 3 has 6 files (since there are 15 - 3 = 12 applications left after removing the first 3). Similarly, Application 4 has 5 files, Application 5 has 4 files, and so on.

Now, let's calculate the total number of files remaining after removing all applications:

Total file count = File count - (Application count \* Number of files per application)
= 59 - (15 \* 7)
= 59 - 105
= -46

Therefore, there are 46 files remaining after removing all applications from Dave's phone."
Response:  We know that there are 24 files and 13 applications in total.  If we subtract the number of applications (13) from the total number of files (24), we get 11 remaining files.  Therefore, the number of files that were not applications is 11.
Response:  We know that there are 24 applications installed on Dave's phone and 9 files.  To find out how many applications and files are left after deleting 5 files and 12 applications, we can use subtraction.  So, the number of remaining applications is 24 - 12 = 12.  And the number of remaining files is 9 - 5 = 4. Therefore, there are 12 applications and 4 files left on Dave's phone after deleting 5 files and 12 applications.
Response:  We know that there are 11 applications and 3 files on Dave's phone.  To find out how many files and programs he has left after deleting 24 files and 2 programs, we need to subtract these numbers from the total number of files and programs he had initially.  So, the number of files and programs Dave has left on his phone is:  Files = 9 (initially 11 - 24) Programs = 1 (initially 3 - 2) Therefore, Dave's phone has 9 files and 1 program left after deleting 24 files and 2 programs.
Response:  We know that Nell has 242 cards in total and he gives 136 of them to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nell is:   Number of cards left with Nell = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 242 - 136 = 106 cards. Therefore, there are 106 cards left with Nell after giving 136 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Jeff has 301 cards and he gave 154 to Nell. So, the number of cards Nell had initially is:  Number of cards Nell had initially = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Nell = 301 - 154 = 147
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell has 528 cards and Jeff has 11 cards.  Therefore, the total number of cards is: 528 + 11 = 539 cards.  Now, we are asked how many cards Nell will give to Jeff. We can see from the question that Nell has 528 cards left after giving some cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards Nell gives to Jeff is: 528 - 11 = 517 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell has 566 cards and Jeff has 234 cards.  If Jeff gives some of his cards to Nell, then he will have fewer cards than before. So, let's say Jeff has x cards left after giving some to Nell. We also know that the total number of cards Nell has is 566, so the sum of Nell's cards plus the cards Jeff has left must equal 566. Therefore, we can write the equation: 566 = Nell's cards + x (where x is the number of cards Jeff has left). Solving for x, we get: x = 332. So, Jeff has 332 cards left after giving some to Nell.
Response:  We know that Nell has 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs.  She trades some of her cards with Jeff, who gets 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card packs back. So, we can calculate the number of baseball cards Nell has left as follows: Number of baseball cards Nell has = Total number of baseball cards - Number of baseball cards traded with Jeff = 309 - (415 + 149) = 267 Therefore, Nell has 267 more baseball cards than Jeff.
Response:  We know that Jeff has 404 baseball cards and 495 non-baseball cards in total.  Now, we need to find out how many more non-baseball cards he has than baseball cards.  So, let's subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of non-baseball cards: 495 - 404 = 91 Non-baseball cards have more than baseball cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell has 573 cards in total and she wants to give 195 of them to John. So, the number of cards left with Nell is 573 - 195 = 378. Now, we are asked how many cards Nell will give to Jeff. Since Jeff only needs 210 cards, the number of cards Nell will give to him is 378 - 210 = 168 cards. Therefore, Nell will give Jeff 168 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell has 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card sets.  If she trades some of her cards with Jeff, then she will have fewer than 55 cards left.  Moreover, we know that Jeff gets 55 cards from Nell, which means he now has 55 + 18 = 73 cards in total (including the ten-card sets).  Therefore, the number of baseball cards Nell has is:  Number of Nell's baseball cards = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 438 - 55 = 383 cards.  So, Nell has 383 baseball cards more than 10 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell has 239 baseball cards and 38 non-baseball cards (including 10 duplicates).  If she trades some of her baseball cards with Jeff, then she will have fewer than 376 baseball cards left (since 376 is greater than 239).  Moreover, we know that Nell has more non-baseball cards than baseball cards, so she must have at least 111 baseball cards left after trading some with Jeff. Therefore, the number of baseball cards Nell has left is between 111 and 239, inclusive.
Response:  If Paco eats 19 cookies at first and then has 35 left, that means he ate a total of 19 + 35 = 54 cookies. So, initially, Paco ate 54 cookies.
Response:  Since Paco has 28 pieces of bread and he eats 7 of them, then he has 28 - 7 = 21 pieces of bread left. So, Paco has 21 pieces of bread left to eat.
Response:  First, Paco had 40 pieces of bread and he ate two. So, he has 40 - 2 = 38 pieces of bread left. Then, he bought 37 bags of cookies. Since each bag contains 10 cookies, he bought 37 x 10 = 370 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco has 38 - 370 = -332 pieces of bread left.
Response:  First, Paco ate 5 pieces of cookies. Then, he bought 3 more pieces of cookies. So, after eating and buying, Paco had a total of 25 - 5 + 3 = 18 pieces of cookies left. Therefore, Paco ate 5 pieces of cookies and bought 3 pieces of cookies, leaving him with 18 pieces of cookies in total.
Response:  First, Paco had 13 pieces of candy. He ate 2 pieces, so he has 13 - 2 = 11 pieces left. Then, he bought 36 more pieces of candy, so he now has 11 + 36 = 47 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  Paco has 40 pieces of bread and eats 5 cookies. Now he has 40 - 5 = 35 pieces of bread left. He then gives 13 pieces of bread to his friends. So, after giving away the bread, he has 35 - 13 = 22 pieces of bread left.
Response:  Paco has 17 pieces of cookies and he eats 14 pieces. So, he has 13 remaining pieces. Now, he gives 13 pieces to his friend. His friend eats all those pieces, so now Paco has 0 pieces left. Therefore, the number of pieces of cookies that Paco's friend eats is 13.
Response:  Paco has 12 pieces of cookies and eats 16 pieces. So he has 12 - 16 = -4 pieces of cookies left. Then he gives 21 pieces to his friends. So his friends have 21 + (-4) = 17 pieces of cookies in total. Therefore, there are 17 more pieces of cookies than Paco had initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco has 22 sweet pastries and 75 regular pastries. So, in total, he has 97 pastries (22 + 75). Then, we are told that Paco ate 15 sweet pastries and 54 regular pastries. Therefore, the number of pastries left with Paco is: Number of pastries left = Total number of pastries - Number of pastries eaten = 97 - 69 = 28 pastries. So, there are 28 sweet pastries left with Paco.
Response:  Paco has 9 sweet pastries and 6 savory pastries. He eats 36 sweet pastries and 3 savory pastries. To find out how many sweet pastries Paco has left, we need to subtract the number of sweet pastries he ate from the total number of sweet pastries he had. So, the answer is:  Number of sweet pastries Paco has left = Total number of sweet pastries - Number of sweet pastries Paco ate = 9 + 3 = 12 Therefore, Paco has 12 sweet pastries left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 37 pieces of sweet bread and 11 pieces of savory bread. He eats 5 pieces of sweet bread and 2 pieces of savory bread. So, the number of sweet bread he eats is 5 + 2 = 7. Therefore, Paco eats 7 pieces of sweet bread in total.
Response:  Paco has 8 sweet bread rolls and 6 savory bread rolls. He eats 20 bread rolls in total (including both sweet and savory). So, he eats 8/6 = 1.33 times more savory bread rolls than sweet bread rolls. Since each savory bread roll is worth 3/4 of a sweet bread roll, Paco eats 1.33 x 3/4 = 0.975 times as many savory bread rolls as sweet bread rolls. Therefore, Paco eats 8 + 0.975 \* 6 = 15.65 bread rolls in total.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 36 cookies and there were initially 37 cookies, then we can deduce that Paco has left behind X cookies, where X is equal to 37 - 36 = 1 cookie. Therefore, Paco has left behind one cookie.
Response:  Paco has 36 cookies and gives 14 to his friends. After that, he eats 10 more cookies. So, the number of cookies left with Paco is: 36 - (14 + 10) = 22 cookies.
Response:  Paco has 41 pieces of candy and he shares them equally among his 9 friends. So each friend gets 4 + 1 = 5 pieces of candy. Now, Paco eats 18 more pieces of candy than his friends. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy that Paco eat is 18 - 5 = 13 pieces of candy.  Hence, Paco eats 13 more pieces of candy than his friends.
Response:  Paco has 6 cookies and gives 30 to his friends. So, he has 30 - 6 = 24 cookies left. Then, he eats 23 of them, leaving him with 1 cookie. Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco's friends have is 30 (the total amount given) minus the number of cookies Paco had after giving some away (24), which is equal to the number of cookies Paco ate (23). Hence, Paco's friends have 30 - 24 = 6 more cookies than Paco has.
Response:  Bacon has 97 pieces of bread and 34 pieces of cake. If he eats 15 pieces of cake and 56 pieces of bread, then he will have 97 - 15 = 82 pieces of bread left. Since he already ate 56 pieces of bread, there are now 82 - 56 = 26 pieces of bread left. Therefore, Bacon has 26 pieces of cake left.
Response:  Paco has 26 pieces of bread and 17 pieces of cake. He eats 14 pieces of cake and 9 pieces of bread. So, how many pieces of bread does Paco have left? We can start by counting the number of pieces of bread that Paco had initially: 26. Then, we subtract the number of pieces of bread that he ate: 9. Finally, we add the number of pieces of cake that he ate back to the remaining bread: 14 + 9 = 23. Therefore, Paco has 23 pieces of bread left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 39 pieces of sweet bread and 6 pieces of plain bread. He eats 23 pieces of sweet bread and 32 pieces of plain bread. So, the number of pieces of sweet bread he eats is equal to the total number of pieces of bread he eats minus the number of pieces of plain bread he eats. Therefore, the number of pieces of sweet bread Paco eats is:  Number of sweet bread = Total bread - Plain bread = 39 + 6 - 23 = 14 Pieces of sweet bread.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco has 40 pieces of sweet bread and 25 pieces of cake. So, in total, he has 65 pieces of baked goods (40 + 25). Now, we are told that he ate 28 pieces of bread and 15 pieces of cake. Therefore, the number of pieces of baked goods that Paco did not eat is: 65 - (28 + 15) = 32 pieces. So, Paco ate 32 more pieces of baked goods than he had.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $70 as gift money. Then, she used some of it to buy an item worth $50. So, the remaining amount is $20 ($70 - $50). Therefore, Gwen spent $20 on the item.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $100 as birthday money. Then, she used $80 of it to buy something. So, the amount of money left with her is $20 ($100 - $80). Therefore, Gwen spent $80 on whatever she bought.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $20 from her mother and $40 from her father. Therefore, in total, she has $60. Now, if she uses $3 of it, then she will have $57 left ($60 - $3 = $57).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $80 from her mother and $5 from her father, so in total she got $85. Now, let's calculate how much more or less her father made compared to her mother. We can do this by subtracting the amount her father gave her ($5) from the total amount she received ($85): $85 - $5 = $80. So, her father made $80 more than her mother.
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $30 from her mother and $6 from her father, so in total she got $36. Now, if Gwen used $4 of that money, then she has $32 left. So, the distance between the amount Gwen received from her father ($6) and the amount she had left after using $4 is $32 - $6 = $26.
Response:  If Gwen received $50 from her father and $7 from her mother, then she has a total of $57. Now, if she used $4 of that money to buy something, how much does she have left? So, the difference between what she had before ($57) and after using $4 is $53. Therefore, her mother made more than her father by $53 - $4 = $49.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $50 from her father and $20 from her mother. Therefore, the total amount of money she received is $50 + $20 = $70. Now, let's calculate how much more or less Gwen received compared to each parent. From her father, Gwen received $50 - $10 = $40 more than what he gave her mother. Similarly, from her mother, Gwen received $20 - $10 = $10 more than what her father gave her. So, the difference in the amount given by each parent is $40 (from father) - $10 (from mother) = $30. Therefore, if Gwen used all $60, the distance between the amount she received from her parents would be $60 - $30 = $30.
Response:  If Josh has 9 marbles in his collection and he loses some of them, then he has fewer than 9 marbles left. We don't know exactly how many marbles he lost, but we can assume that it's at least one since he only has 4 small blocks left. So, the number of marbles Josh lost is at least 1.
Response:  If Josh has 12 pearls in his collection and he throws away 21 small blocks of wood, then we can calculate the number of pearls left in his collection as follows: Number of pearls left = Total number of pearls - Number of pearls thrown away Total number of pearls = 12 + 21 = 33 So, there are 33 pearls left in Josh's collection after throwing away 21 small blocks of wood.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 pearls in his collection and lost 5 of them. So he has 19 - 5 = 14 pearls left. Then, he found 5 new pearls, so now he has 14 + 5 = 19 pearls in his collection again. Therefore, Josh has 19 pearls in his collection after finding the new ones.
Response:  At first, Josh had 4 stones in his collection and lost 16 of them. So he had 4 - 16 = -12 stones left. Then, he found 8 new stones. Therefore, the total number of stones Josh has now is -12 + 8 = 6 stones.  Hence, Josh lost more than he gained, i.e., -12 > 8.
Response:  Firstly, Josh has 7 pebbles in his collection. He throws away 8 pebbles, leaving him with 7 - 8 = 1 pebble remaining. Now, he finds 10 new pebbles. So, the total number of pebbles Josh has after finding the new ones is 1 + 10 = 11 pebbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh has collected 21 pearls and picked up 7 jade stones. So far so good! Now, let's calculate how many more pearls he might have in total. We can do this by subtracting the number of jade stones he picked up from the total number of pearls he collected: 21 - 7 = 14. Therefore, Josh has 14 more pearls than what he already has (i.e., 21 - 7 = 14).
Response:  Since Josh has 20 beads in his collection and he gives 2 beads to Jack, then Josh still has 18 beads left (20 - 2 = 18). So, the number of beads Josh has is 18.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh has collected 22 precious stones and given 20 of them to Jack. So, Josh must have had some number of pebbles before giving any away. Therefore, the number of pebbles Josh has is equal to the total number of pebbles he had minus the number of precious stones he gave away. In this case, Josh had 3 pebbles initially (since he had 22 - 20 = 3 pebbles).
Response:  If Josh had 19 pebbles before and threw away 11 of them, he now has 8 pebbles left (19 - 11 = 8). So, he has 8 / 2 = 4 remaining pebbles.
Response:  Josh has 22 gems in total and he found 13 of them. So, he lost 5 gems. Now, we need to find out how many gems Josh has left. We can do this by subtracting the number of gems he lost (5) from the total number of gems he had (22): 22 - 5 = 17 Therefore, Josh has 17 gems left.
Response:  Josh has 15 pearls in his collection and he finds 9 of them. So, he has lost 6 pearls (15 - 9 = 6). Now, he throws away 23 pearls. Therefore, he has gained 23 - 6 = 17 pearls. In total, Josh has lost 6 + gained 17 = 23 pearls.
Response:  If Josh has three rubies in his collection and he finds six more rubies, then he now has nine rubies in total (three + six = nine). However, if he loses one ruby during this process, then he will have eight rubies left (nine - one = eight). Therefore, the number of stones that Josh picked up is eight.
"Response:  According to the question, Mark's father weighs 4.5 kg (or 4500 grams). Mark himself weighs 19 pounds or 8.6 kg. To find out how much heavier Mark is than his father, we can divide the weight of Mark by the weight of his father and multiply by 100. So, 
$$ \frac{8.6}{4.5} = 190 $$
Therefore, Mark is $190$ times heavier than his father."
Response:  According to the question, Mark's father weighs 13 pounds and his brother weighs 10 kilograms (or 22 pounds). So, if Mark's father weighs more than his brother, then Mark must weigh less than his brother. Therefore, Mark's weight is 13 - 22 = -9 pounds.
Response:  We know that 马可 (Mak) has 20 pounds of grass and his father has 17 pounds of grass. So, we can calculate the difference between their weights as follows:  Difference = 马可的草重 - 爸爸的草重 = 20 - 17 = 3 pounds Therefore, Mak's grass is 3 pounds heavier than his father's grass.
Response:  Marco and his father have different weights for their grass. Marco has 8 pounds of grass, while his father has 32 pounds. To find out how many times heavier Marco's grass is than his father's, we can divide the weight of Marco's grass by the weight of his father's grass: 8 / 32 = 0.25 or 1/4. So Marco's grass is one-quarter as heavy as his father's.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 马可 (Mak) and his father collected together 24 pounds of grass. Then, Mak reduced the weight of the grass by 9 pounds, so the remaining weight is 24 - 9 = 15 pounds. Finally, we are asked how much heavier or lighter the grass collected by Mak's father is compared to the original weight of 24 pounds. Therefore, the answer is 15 / 24 = 0.63, which means that the grass collected by Mak's father is 37% heavier than the original weight of 24 pounds.
Response:  According to the problem, Mark and his father collected 18 kg of grass together. Then, when they returned home, Mark's father lost 3 kg, leaving him with 12 kg of grass. So, how much did Mark's father collect? Solution: We know that Mark's father collected 18 kg of grass, and then he lost 3 kg, so he had 15 kg (18 - 3) of grass left. Therefore, the amount of grass Mark's father collected is 15 kg.
Response:  According to the question, Mark and his father went to pick grass together, and they picked 22 pounds of grass in total. Then, Mark's father found ten pounds of fruit. So, the total weight of the things that Mark's father found is 32 pounds (22 + 10). Therefore, the weight of the grass that Mark picked is 22 pounds.
Response:  If 马可同佢爸爸去草果 (Mak can go to the fruit garden with his father) and Mak's share of the grass is 15 pounds, then the total weight of all the grass they will gather is 50 pounds. Since Mak's father also has some grass, we need to find out how much it weighs in relation to the total amount. So, the weight of Mak's father's grass is equal to 50 pounds divided by the total amount of grass they gathered, which is 50 pounds / 15 pounds = 3.33 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Mak's father's grass is approximately 3.33 pounds.
Response:  If Mark can carry 30 pounds of grass and his father can carry 17 pounds of grass together, then we know that Mark's weight is 30/2 = 15 pounds more than his father's weight. Therefore, Mark's weight is 15 x 2 = 30 pounds.
Response:  If 马可 (Mak) has 10 pounds of grass and his father adds another 16 pounds, then in total they have 26 pounds of grass. Now, to find out how much more weight Mak's father's grass has than Mak's grass, we can subtract the weight of Mak's grass from the total weight of both their grasses: 26 pounds - 10 pounds = 16 pounds. So, Mak's father's grass is 16 pounds heavier than Mak's grass.
"Response:  If Mark's father bought 11 pounds of grass and then added more to make it 30 pounds in total, we can calculate the weight of each addition as follows:

Firstly, if Mark's father added 29 pounds (30 - 11 = 29) of grass, then the total weight of the grass would be:

11 + 29 = 40 pounds

Therefore, Mark's grass has an additional weight of 29 pounds."
Response:  Firstly, there are two main roads with bus stops, and each of them has multiple small roads that lead to different destinations. Therefore, we can assume that there are at least 10 small roads in total. However, since some of these small roads may overlap or have similar names, it is difficult to give an exact number without further information. So, I would estimate the number of small roads as around 10-20.
Response:  We know that there are 26 small roads leading to the bus station and 38 cars passing through these roads. So, if each car has one child, then we have 26 x 38 = 974 children on the bus. However, since some cars may have more than one child, let's assume that each car has an average of 2 children. Therefore, the total number of children on the bus is 974 x 2 = 1948 children.
Response:  Firstly, there are two small roads that meet at the bus station, and each of them has one car driving on it. Therefore, the total number of cars driving on these two small roads is 2 x 1 = 2.  Next, there are 41 little friends sitting tightly on the bus. Since they are all riding on the same bus, we can ignore them for now. Finally, there are three small roads in total (the two small roads that meet at the bus station plus the main road), so the total number of cars driving on all three small roads is 3.  Hence, the answer is 2 + 0 + 3 = 5 cars driving on the small roads.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 43 routes in total. Since 21 of them are left at the bus station, we can deduce that 21 x = 43 / 2 = 20.5 routes are not left at the bus station. So, the answer is 20.
Response:  We know that there are 41 routes in total and only 18 of them can be accommodated on the bus stop. So, we have to find out how many extra routes there are compared to the number of routes that can fit on the bus stop. To do this, we need to subtract the number of routes that can fit on the bus stop from the total number of routes. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of extra routes. In other words, if X is the number of routes that can fit on the bus stop, then the number of extra routes is X - 18. So, the answer is X - 18.
Response:  There are 21 roads in total, and 10 of them have cars parked on them. So there are 11 empty roads (21 - 10 = 11). Now, let's count how many kids are sitting on the bus. The question says there are 16 kids sitting on the bus. Therefore, the number of kids who get off the bus is 16 - 11 = 5.
Response:  Firstly, there are five bus routes (A, B, C, D, and E) with 63 stops in total. Now, we need to find out how many times each route has been taken by passengers. We can do this by dividing the number of stops by the number of passengers who took that route. For example, if Route A has 10 stops and 5 passengers took it, then the utilization rate of Route A is 5/10 = 0.5 or 50%. Similarly, for other routes, we calculate their utilization rates as follows: Route B - 20 stops / 8 passengers = 0.25 or 25%, Route C - 30 stops / 12 passengers = 0.25 or 25%, Route D - 40 stops / 15 passengers = 0.27 or 27%, and Route E - 50 stops / 20 passengers = 0.25 or 25%. Therefore, the overall average utilization rate of all five bus routes is (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.27 + 0.25 + 0.25) / 5 = 0.24 or 24%. So, approximately 24% of the time, one of these five bus routes will be full.
Response:  Firstly, there are 36 small roads at the bus stop, and 68 people get off the bus. So, the number of people who get off the bus is 68 - 36 = 32.  Then, among these 32 people, there are 12 little friends who ride the bus. Therefore, the ratio of people getting off the bus to little friends riding the bus is 32 : 12 = 2.5.
Response:  Firstly, there are 22 routes in total. Since 40 people get off at the bus station, that means 18 people remain on the bus (40 - 22 = 18). Now, among these remaining 18 people, two people sit together on one seat, so they will occupy only one seat. Therefore, the number of seats left for other passengers is 18 - 1 = 17 seats.
Response:  There are 28 roads on the car above and 82 roads on the car below. After driving for some time, 14 roads have fallen off the car above and 56 roads have fallen off the car below. Therefore, there are 28 - 14 = 14 roads left on the car above that haven't fallen off yet, and 82 - 56 = 26 roads left on the car below that haven't fallen off yet. So, the number of roads left on the car above after driving for some time is 14, and the number of roads left on the car below after driving for some time is 26.
"Response:  Firstly, there are 23 routes in total. Since there are 24 buses running along these routes, we can infer that each bus is assigned to one route. Therefore, the number of people who take the bus daily is equal to the number of buses multiplied by the number of routes, which is:

$$ = 24 \times 23 = 548 $$

Now, let's consider the other group of people who do not take the bus and walk or drive themselves instead. There are eight roads in total that lead to the bus station, so the number of people who use these roads to commute is:

$$ = 8 $$

Therefore, the total number of people who commute to work using public transportation (bus) is:

$$ = 548 + 8 = 556 $$

So, there are approximately 556 people who commute to work using public transportation in this scenario."
Response:  If the teacher and student made 133 pieces of cake together, and they sold 51 pieces, then we can calculate how many times the cakes were sold as follows: Number of sales = Total number of cakes / Number of cakes sold = 133 / 51 = 2.64 times So, the baker sold approximately 2.64 times more cakes than the total number of cakes made by the teacher and student together.
Response:  If the teacher and student together made 54 pieces of cake, and the student sold part of them, then we can assume that the number of cakes the student sold is less than or equal to 54.  Therefore, if the student has 13 cakes left, he must have sold at least 41 cakes (54 - 13 = 41).
Response:  If he sold 145 pieces of cake and has 72 eggs left, then we can calculate how many times he made the cake as follows: Number of times = Total number of cakes / Number of eggs used per cake So, in this case, the number of times he made the cake is: Number of times = 145 / 72 = 3 Therefore, he made the cake 3 times with the remaining 72 eggs.
Response:  If the baker made 155 eggs and sold 140 of them, then there are 15 - 14 = 1 egg left over.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the teacher sold 121 pieces of cake and bought 170 pieces of cake. So, the difference between the number of cakes sold and the number of cakes bought is:

121 - 170 = -49

Therefore, there are 49 fewer cakes than the total number of cakes sold and bought together."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker sold 91 pieces of cake and bought 154 new eggs. So, the difference between the number of cakes sold and the number of eggs bought is:

91 - 154 = -63

Therefore, the baker bought more eggs than he sold."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of cakes baked is 170. Then, we are given that the baker sold 78 cakes and bought 31 cakes. So, the difference between the number of cakes sold and the number of cakes bought is: 78 - 31 = 47 cakes. Therefore, the baker sold 47 more cakes than he bought.
Response:  Firstly, the baker made 110 pieces of cake and sold 75 of them. So, there are 35 remaining cakes (110 - 75 = 35). Then, the baker remade 76 more cakes after selling the initial 75. Therefore, the total number of cakes that the baker has now is 35 + 76 = 111 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 144 pieces of cake and sold 71 of them. Then he remade 111 more cakes. So, in total, the baker sold 71 + 111 = 182 pieces of cake.
Response:  If Baker has 149 eggs and sells 10 eggs, he will have 139 eggs left (149 - 10 = 139).  Similarly, if he sells 90 points, he will have 59 points left (90 - 10 = 59).  So, Baker will have 59 eggs left after selling 10 eggs and 90 points.
"Response:  If the baker made 7 batches of cakes and each batch makes 148 pieces of points, then he has made a total of:

7 batches x 148 pieces/batch = 984 pieces of points

Now, if he sold 15 cakes and 103 points, then the number of points left with him is:

984 - (15 + 103) = 866 pieces of points

Therefore, the baker still has 866 pieces of points."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, the baker made 126 pieces of cake and 48 pieces of pastry. If he sold 115 pieces of cake and 81 pieces of dessert, then we can calculate the number of unsold items as follows: Unsold cakes = 126 - 115 = 11 Unsold pastries = 48 - 81 = -33 Therefore, the baker has 11 unsold cakes and 33 unsold pastries.
Response:  If he sold 70 eggs and 88 points of dumplings, then he must have made more than 70 + 88 = 158 dumplings.  Since there are 19 types of dumplings, he must have made at least 158 / 19 = 8 dumplings of each type.  Therefore, he has made a total of 8 x 19 = 152 dumplings.  As for the eggs, since he sold 70, he must have made less than or equal to 70 / 2 = 35 eggs.
Response:  If the baker sold 157 pieces of cake and 169 points of sweets, then the total number of items sold is: 157 + 169 = 326. Therefore, the baker sold 326 items in total (157 cakes + 147 sweets).
Response:  If the baker sold 54 pieces of cake and 143 pieces of pastry, then the total number of items sold is 54 + 143 = 197.  If he/she sold 68 pieces of cake and 92 pieces of dessert, then the total number of items sold is 68 + 92 = 160. Therefore, the baker sold 160 - 197 = -37 pieces of dessert and 197 pieces of cake.
Response:  If he started with 48 pieces of bread and sold 44 pieces, then he has 4 - 44 = -42 pieces left. So, the baker has -42 pieces of bread left.
Response:  If he started making 40 pieces of cake at first and then sold 8 more, that means he made a total of 40 + 8 = 48 pieces of cake in total. So, he sold 48 / 2 = 24 pieces of cake.
"Response:  If your friend bought 137 eggs and started with 169 eggs initially, then we can calculate the remaining number of eggs as follows:

Remaining eggs = Initial eggs - Number of eggs purchased
= 169 - 137
= 32

So, there are 32 eggs left after your friend buys 137 eggs."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the teacher and student together made 173 pieces of cake. Then, the teacher bought 103 new cakes, which means there are now 70 (173 - 103) remaining original cakes left. Finally, the teacher sold 86 of these remaining cakes, leaving 44 (86 - 70) cakes unsold. Therefore, there are 44 cakes in total.
Response:  The baker made 99 pieces of cake and sold 89 pieces. So he has 10 extra pieces left over (99 - 89 = 10). Now, the baker bought 167 eggs to make more cakes. Since each egg can make one piece of cake, the baker used all 167 eggs to make 167 pieces of cake. Therefore, the number of additional pieces of cake that the baker made is equal to the number of eggs he bought minus the number of pieces of cake he already had (167 - 10 = 157). So the answer is 157.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker sold 8 trays of cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes he sold is 8 x 20 = 160 cakes. Now, let's consider the number of new cakes bought by the baker. He bought 139 cakes, which means he had (139 - 8) = 131 remaining cakes from his previous stock. Finally, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of remaining cakes to find out how many cakes he has left. So, the number of cakes the baker has left is 131 - 160 = -31 cakes. Therefore, the baker has -31 cakes.
Response:  Firstly, Shifu and his students made 62 pieces of cake. Then, they remade 149 pieces of cake after that. If we assume that each time they made an equal number of pieces, then the total number of pieces of cake they made is: 62 + 149 = 211 pieces of cake. So, there are 211 - 144 = 67 pieces of cake left over for sale.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the teacher and student together made 81 pieces of cake. Then, they divided them into 92 pieces afterward. So, the total number of cakes sold is: 81 + (92 - 81) = 92 cakes. Therefore, the baker sold 46 slices of cake.
Response:  The baker made 61 pieces of cake and sold 108 pieces of cake, so he has excess cake to sell.  He also made 44 pieces of bread and sold 44 pieces, so he has no excess bread. Therefore, the baker has (61 - 44) = 17 excess cakes.
Response:  If the baker made 56 pieces of bread and 124 pieces of cake, then he sold 104 pieces of cake and 29 pieces of bread. So, the number of remaining bread is equal to the total number of bread minus the number of bread sold = 56 - 29 = 27. Therefore, the baker has 27 pieces of bread left.
Response:  If the baker sold 102 eggs and 94 eggs, then he sold a total of 196 eggs (102 + 94). Now, we need to find out how many egg tarts and pineapple tarts the baker sold. According to the question, the baker made 52 egg tarts and 84 pineapple tarts. So, if he sold all of them, he would have sold 52 x 84 = 4320 pieces of egg tarts and pineapple tarts together. Therefore, the baker sold 4320 - 196 = 4124 pieces of egg tarts and pineapple tarts in total.
Response:  If he sold 140 pieces of cake and 92 pieces of pastry, then he must have made at least 140 + 92 = 232 pieces in total. Since he can make 134 pieces of dumplings and 11 pieces of cake, we know that he has enough capacity to produce at most 232 - (134 + 11) = 98 pieces of dumplings. Therefore, the number of dumplings the chef can make is 98.
Response:  If he sold 14 cakes and 153 points, then he has a total of 167 items (14 x 153 = 2190).  If he sold 8 points and 97 cakes, then he has a remaining amount of 167 - 8 = 159 items left to sell. So, yes, he has more than 8 points worth of cakes left to sell.
Response:  If he sold 154 pieces of pastry and 78 pieces of cake, then the total number of pastries and cakes he sold are 154 + 78 = 232.  Since he made 43 pieces of cake and 114 pieces of pastry, the number of cakes he sold is 43 / 114 = 0.37, and the number of pastries he sold is 114 / 114 = 1. Therefore, the number of pastry pieces sold exceeds the number of cake pieces sold by 1 - 0.37 = 0.63.
Response:  If Katelyn has 22 Nintendo games and buys 140 more games, then she will have a total of 162 games (22 + 140). To find out how many games are left after buying 140, we need to subtract the number of games she already had from the total number of games she bought: 162 - 22 = 140. So there are 140 games left after Katelyn buys 140 more games.
Response:  If Katelyn has 106 Nintendo games and she gives away 64 of them to other people, then she will have 32 games left.
Response:  If Katelyn has 91 Nintendo games and she wants to play all of them, then she will need 92 matches (or sessions) to complete playing all of them. Therefore, the answer is 92.
Response: 凱莉 has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To determine how many Nintendo games she needs to sell before having 12 Nintendo games, we need to divide the number of Nintendo games she has by 12. So, 凱莉 needs to sell (20 / 12) = 16 Nintendo games before she can have 12 Nintendo games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kaitlyn has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To sell 31 Sony games before selling any of her Nintendo games, we need to subtract 31 from 132. So, the number of Sony games left after selling 31 is: 132 - 31 = 101. Therefore, Kaitlyn will have 101 Sony games left after selling 31 Sony games before selling any of her Nintendo games.
"Response:  If Katelyn has 80 Nintendo games and she wants to trade out at least 31 of them, we can calculate how many games are left for her to trade as follows:

Number of games left = Total number of games - Number of games traded away
= 80 - 31
= 49

Therefore, Katelyn will have 49 Nintendo games left after trading out at least 31 of them."
Response:  Randi has $52$ blocks to build a tower. If he uses $38$ of them, then he must have had $\frac{52}{38} = 1 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 1 = 10$ blocks left over after building the tower. Therefore, Randi initially had $52 - 10 = 42$ blocks.
Response:  If Randy has 97 street districts and uses some of them to build a tower, then he will have 72 street districts left after building the tower. To determine how many street districts are needed for the tower construction, we can divide the number of remaining street districts by the number of street districts used for the tower construction. In this case, if Randy uses 30 street districts for the tower construction, he will need 42 street districts (72 - 30 = 42) for the tower construction.
Response:  Randy has 79 streets and he uses 14 of them to build a tower. This means that there are 65 remaining streets (79 - 14 = 65). Then, he uses 11 of these remaining streets to build a house. So, there are 54 remaining streets left after building the house (65 - 11 = 54). Therefore, there are 54 streets left after both the tower and the house are built.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has 58 districts and he uses 27 of them to build one skyscraper. This means that he has 31 remaining districts left.  Then, he uses 53 of these districts to build another building. So, he has 18 districts left after constructing this second building. Therefore, Randy used 39 pieces of Lego bricks (31 + 18 = 39) to build both buildings together.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has 37 streets and he uses 33 blocks to build one big building. So, the number of blocks left is 37 - 33 = 4.  Now, let's consider how many blocks Randy needs to use to build another small house. We know that Randy uses 13 blocks to build one small house, so he can build 4 houses using all the remaining 4 blocks. Therefore, the number of blocks needed to build the tower is 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has 86 districts and he uses 79 pieces of land to build a tower. Therefore, he has 7 pieces of land left over.  Next, we are asked how many blocks Randy used to build his house. We know that Randy built one big building with 82 blocks of land, so he must have used all 82 blocks to build his house.  Now, let's calculate how many blocks Randy has left after building his house. Since he had 7 pieces of land left over before building his house, and he used all 82 blocks to build his house, then he has 7 - 82 = -75 blocks left over.  However, this is impossible as you cannot have negative blocks! So, the correct answer is that Randy does not have enough blocks to build another tower or any other structure.
Response:  If Randy has 36 districts to build a tower and he uses all of them, then he will have used up all of his available land for building the tower. So, if he has 59 districts in total, there are 23 districts left over that he cannot use to build the tower (59 - 36 = 23).
Response:  Firstly, Randi has 95 streets to choose from. If he wants to build a house using 20 streets, then he can build a house that is 20/95 = 1/4.76 meters tall (approximately).  Next, if he wants to build a tower using 50 streets, then he can build a tower that is 50/95 = 0.53 meters tall (approximately).  Therefore, the height of the tower is greater than the height of the house.
Response:  Randi has 90 streets to choose from and he chooses 89 of them to build his house. This means that he has 1 street left over. Then, he uses 63 streets to build his tower. So, in total, Randi used 89 + 63 = 152 streets to build both his house and tower. Therefore, Randi used more streets to build his tower than his house.
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have read fewer than five books, then you have read at most 5/20 = 1/4 of the books in the series.
Response:  If there are 13 books in the series and you have already read 13 of them, then there are only 8 books left to read. So, the number of books in the series is 8.
Response:  If there are 22 different books in the series and you have watched 12 of them, then you still need to watch 9 more books (22 - 12 = 9).
Response:  If there are four books in the series and each book has ten chapters, then there are forty chapters in total.  If we watch seven chapters of the TV drama adaptation, that means we have watched thirty-three chapters (40 - 7 = 33). So if we want to know how many more chapters we need to watch, we can subtract the number of chapters we have already watched from the total number of chapters in the series: 33 - 7 = 26. Therefore, we still need to watch twenty-six chapters of the TV drama adaptation.
"Response:  According to the question, there are 16 books and 14 movies in the ""瘋狂嘅愚蠢學校"" series. If you have read 19 books from this series, that means you have not watched all of the movies. Therefore, the number of books in the series that is greater than the number of movies is 19 - 14 = 5."
Response:  According to the question, there are eight books in the series and each book has ten chapters, so there are 8 x 10 = 80 chapters in total.  Then, we are asked if watching all 19 books would result in more than 61 episodes of movies. To calculate this, we need to know how many episodes each movie is based on the number of chapters in each book. Since each chapter is approximately 20 minutes long (based on common TV episode lengths), we can assume that each movie is around 4 hours long, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Therefore, if we have 80 chapters in total, each movie would be approximately 240/80 = 3 movies long. So, yes, watching all 19 books would result in more than 61 episodes of movies, with an actual count of 61 + 3 = 64 episodes.
Response:  If you have watched 13 books and 12 movies, then you have watched a total of 25 items (13 books + 12 movies). So, if you have watched more than half of the total number of items (i.e., 25), then you have watched more books than movies. Therefore, the answer is  Yes, you have watched more books than movies.
Response:  If we read 7 books from the series, that means we have read 7/11 = 0.636 books (approximately) of the series.  Now, if we watch 21 movies based on those books, that means we have watched 21 / 11 = 1.918 movies (approximately) based on the books we read. So, in total, we have watched approximately 1.918 - 0.636 = 1.282 more movies than books we read.
"Response:  If there are 14 books in the ""瘋狂的愚蠢學校"" series and you have already read 8 of them, then you still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
Response:  If there are 62 movies in the series and you have watched 34 of them, then you still need to watch 28 more movies (62 - 34 = 28).  Therefore, if you want to read four books from the series, you will need to read 7 books in total (28 / 4 = 7).
Response:  If we have eight movies and twenty-one books in the series, that means there are 8 + 21 = 29 items in total.  If you watch seven books or four movies, then you still need to watch 29 - 7 = 22 more items. So, if you watch seven books, you will need to watch five more movies (29 - 4 = 25).
"Response:  According to the question, if you have read 11 books from the series and watched 40 movies, then we can assume that you have covered approximately half of the total number of books and movies in the series.  Therefore, the difference between the number of books and movies in the series is:  Number of books - Number of movies = 11 (books read) - 40 (movies watched) = 29  So, there are 29 more books than movies in the ""瘋狂嘅愚蠢學校"" series."
Response:  According to the question, if you have read 13 books from the series and watched 63 movies, then we can calculate the ratio of movie-to-book as follows: Movie Ratio = Number of Movies Watched / Number of Books Read = 63 / 13 = 5 So, for every book you read, there are approximately 5 movies in the series.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are ten books in the series and six movies. So, the total number of works is 6 + 10 = 16. Now, if you have watched more than 14 movies, it means you have watched at least 14 + 1 = 15 works. Similarly, if you have read more than 19 books, it means you have read at least 19 + 1 = 20 works. Therefore, the difference between the number of books you have read and the number of movies you have watched is 20 - 15 = 5.
Response:  If there are eight books and five movies in the series, that means there are 8 x 5 = 40 total works of media in the series.  If you have watched ten nineteen (19) movies and read sixteen (16) books, then you have watched more than half (40 / 2 = 20) of the movies and more than two-thirds (40 / 3 = 13) of the books. Therefore, you have watched 20 + 13 = 33 parts of the series.
Response:  If David has seven tickets and he uses two of them to buy toys, then he has five tickets left.  Now, if he wants to buy more toys using his remaining tickets, he can use up to four tickets for each toy he buys, since he only has five tickets left. So, in total, David can buy up to eight toys (4 x 2 = 8).
Response:  David has already won 12 tickets and he still has 2 more chances to win. If he wins again, he will have 14 tickets in total. So, if he continues to play until he runs out of tickets, he will win $360.
Response:  David bought 18 tickets to the game and used 5 of them to buy toys worth $5 each. He then used 11 more tickets to buy shirts worth $11 each. How many tickets does David have left? We know that David has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left.
Response:  David bought 19 tickets to the game and spent $12 on toys. If he spent $7 on shirts, how much did he spend on toys compared to shirts? To find out, we need to divide the amount he spent on toys ($12) by the number of toys he bought (19). So, David spent $0.63 per toy.
Response:  David has 13 tickets to spend and he uses 8 of them to buy toys. So far, he has spent $8. Now, he has $5 left (13 - 8 = 5). He then spends another $18 on shirts. In total, David has spent $26 ($8 + $18). Therefore, David used 8/13 of his tickets to buy toys and 11/13 of his tickets to buy shirts.
Response:  Dave lost 14 tickets and won 2 tickets. If he uses $10 to buy toys, how many tickets will he have left? We can calculate this as follows: Number of tickets Dave has = Number of tickets he lost - Number of tickets he won + Amount of money used to buy toys Number of tickets he lost = 14 tickets Number of tickets he won = 2 tickets Amount of money used to buy toys = $10 So, the number of tickets Dave has left is: 14 - (2 + $10) = 14 - ($10 + 2) = 14 - $12 = 2 tickets Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley planted 14 trees in the hospital after Typhoon Nine. Then, we are told that the typhoon caused more than half of the trees to die. Therefore, if there were originally 14 trees, and more than half died, then the number of surviving trees would be:  14 x (1/2) = 7 So, out of the original 14 trees, only 7 survived the typhoon.
Response:  After Typhoon Haley hit Taiwan and caused widespread damage, there were reports of around 13 trees falling down in each household. However, after the typhoon passed, it is estimated that only about 50% of the trees survived. So, out of 13 trees per household, approximately 6-7 trees (50% of 13) remained standing.
"Response:  After Haley hit Taiwan with wind speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h), four trees fell down. Since each tree can be considered as one ""tree died"", we have 4 deaths in total. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  If there were originally 36 trees and after the typhoon, 12 trees remained, then we can assume that for every original tree, there are now half as many remaining trees (i.e., 12/36 = 0.33). So, if we want to know how many new trees will grow in total, we can multiply the number of remaining trees by this factor: 0.33 x 12 = 4 new trees. Therefore, there will be 4 additional trees growing where the original 36 trees once stood.
Response:  Haley planted 9 trees before the typhoon (台風four). After the typhoon, she planted 5 more trees, so there are now 14 trees in total (9 + 5 = 14). Therefore, there are 5 fewer trees than originally planted ( original number of trees - number of new trees = 9 - 5 = 4).
Response:  At first, there were 12 trees planted in total. After the typhoon, only two trees remained. So, we need to find out how many trees were left after the typhoon. To do this, we can divide the original number of trees (12) by the remaining number of trees (2). Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response:  If initially there were three trees planted in the area affected by the typhoon (i.e., the ""after"" situation), and all but one of them died due to the typhoon (i.e., the ""middle"" situation), then we can calculate the number of surviving trees as follows: Number of surviving trees = Initially planted trees - Dead trees after typhoon = 3 - 10 = 2 So, out of the initial 3 trees planted, only 2 survived the typhoon."
Response:  At first, there were 11 trees planted in Harry's backyard after he had them planted. Then, a typhoon came and damaged or killed some of the trees. We don't know exactly how many trees died because of the typhoon. However, we can assume that at least half of the original number of trees survived since they were able to grow taller than before. So, the updated number of living trees in Harry's backyard is: (11/2) x 2 = 5.5 trees.
Response:  If there are 66 baskets of grain per day and each basket contains 28 sub-baskets, then we can calculate the total number of sub-baskets as follows:  Total number of sub-baskets = Number of baskets x Number of sub-baskets per basket = 66 x 28 = 1804 Sub-baskets So, every day, the person can collect 1804 sub-baskets of grain.
Response:  If every day he can harvest 8 baskets of grains, and there are 24 days in a month, then... (calculate)...he will need 24 x 8 = 192 baskets of grains to be harvested during the entire month!
"Response:  If they receive 56 bags of fruit every day and there are 4 days in total, then they will receive a total of:

56 x 4 = 224 bags of fruit

So, they will receive 224 bags of fruit in total."
Response:  Each day, there are 38 bags of flowers collected, and each bag contains 42 sub-bags. Therefore, in total, there are 38 x 42 = 1608 sub-bags collected per day. Since the process continues for 49 days, the total number of sub-bags collected is 1608 x 49 = 79,520 sub-bags.
Response:  Each day, there are 66 bags of fruit produced, and each bag contains 25 fruits. Therefore, in total, there are 66 x 25 = 1600 fruits produced every day. Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for all these fruits to be collected. According to the question, it takes 87 days for all the fruits to be collected. So, after 87 days, there will be no more fruits left to collect. Hence, the number of fruits that were collected is 1600 x 87 = 134,600 fruits.
Response:  Each day, there are 8 baskets of fruit that are picked, and each basket contains 35 fruits. So, in one day, how many fruits will be collected?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of fruits collected per day = Number of baskets x Number of fruits in each basket  = 8 x 35  = 280 fruits per day.
"Response:  If there are 16 baskets of fruit per day and each basket has 57 fruits, then the total number of fruits collected in one day is:

16 x 57 = 904 fruits/day

Now, to find out how many days it will take to collect 80 baskets (which is equal to 80 x 57 = 4480 fruits), we can divide the total number of fruits collected in one day by the number of baskets collected in that day:

4480 fruits / 904 fruits/day = 4.8 days

Therefore, it will take approximately 4.8 days to collect 80 baskets of fruit."
Response:  If there are 67 fruits in total and each fruit has 12 seeds, then there will be 67 x 12 = 804 seeds in total. Now, if Bob collects 35 bags of seeds, he will have collected 35 x 12 = 420 seeds. So, Bob will have 804 - 420 = 384 seeds left after collecting 35 bags.
"Response:  Each day, the person collects 74 bags of food, and among them, 71 are thrown away. So, after n days (where n is the number of days the person has been collecting food), the total number of bags collected will be:

Total bags = 74 x n

Since 71 out of every 74 bags are thrown away, the number of bags actually kept will be:

Kept bags = Total bags - Thrown-away bags
= 74 x n - 71 x n
= n x 3

So, after n days, the person will have kept 3 bags of food."
Response:  After they were caught and found that each day they received 76 bags of apples, then threw away 64 bags. If each bag contains 50 apples, how many apples can they receive per day?  We need to find out how many bags are left after throwing away 64 bags.  So, the number of bags left = Total bags - Number of bags thrown away = 76 - 64 = 12 bags.  Therefore, they can receive 12 x 50 = 600 apples per day.
Response:  After 26 days of cultivation, there will be 28 mature fruit baskets and 52 immature fruit baskets. So, in total, there will be 80 fruit baskets (28 + 52).
Response:  After 25 days, there will be 82 + 61 = 143 fruit baskets that are ready to harvest. So, the number of mature fruit baskets after 25 days is 143.
Response:  On day 0, there are 31 mature fruit and 24 immature fruit. After 45 days, all the immature fruits will be matured, so we have 31 + 24 = 55 fruits in total. Therefore, after 45 days, they can collect 55 bags of fruit.
Response:  If every day, there are 44 bags of mature fruit and 25 bags of immature fruit, then the total number of bags of fruit collected each day is: 44 + 25 = 69 bags. So, the number of bags of fruit collected each day is 69 bags.
Response:  If every day, there are 5 bags of ripe fruit and 74 bags of unripe fruit, then in total, there will be 5 + 74 = 79 bags of fruit per day. So, the number of bags of fruit that exceed the number of ripe fruit is 79 - 5 = 74.
Response:  If he picks up 18 bags per day, it means he will finish all 54 bags in $\frac{54}{18} = 3$ days.
Response:  If he collects 56 bags of fruit every day and each bag contains 14 fruits, then... (calculate)...he will have collected in total... (calculate)...and if he continues to collect at this rate for how many days... (calculate)...then he will have collected... (calculate)...fruit in total!
Response:  If every day, there are 25 fresh fruit baskets and 5 matured fruit baskets that can be harvested, then in total, there will be $25 \times 30 = 750$ fresh fruit baskets and $5 \times 30 = 150$ matured fruit baskets after 73 days. Therefore, the number of matured fruit baskets is $150$.
Response:  If every day, there are 65 bags of fresh fruit and 46 bags of ripe fruit that can be harvested, then in total, how many bags of fruit will be harvested after six days?  To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of bags of fresh fruit per day by 6 (since there are 6 days) and add it to the number of bags of ripe fruit that can be harvested per day. So, the total number of bags of fruit that will be harvested after six days is: 6 x 65 = 390 + 46 = 436 bags of fruit!
Response:  If every day, there are 41 bags of fresh fruit and 86 bags of ripe fruit collected, then the total number of bags collected in one week is:  Weekly collection = Daily collection x Number of days in a week = 41 + 86 = 127 bags. Therefore, the number of extra bags collected each day is: Extra bags per day = Total weekly collection - Daily collection = 127 - 41 = 86 bags.
Response:  If every day, there are 71 bags of immature fruit and 60 bags of mature fruit that can be harvested, then in total, there will be __________ bags of fruit per day. (Note: The number of bags of fruit may vary depending on the size of each bag.)
Response:  The length of the room is 12 feet and the width is 11 feet. To find out how long the room is in feet, we can divide the length by 3 (since there are 3 feet in a foot). So, the length of the room is 12 / 3 = 4 feet. Similarly, to find out how wide the room is in feet, we can divide the width by 3. So, the width of the room is 11 / 3 = 3.67 feet. Therefore, the length of the room is 4 feet and the width is 3.67 feet.
"Response:  If the living room is 7 feet wide and needs an area of 14 square feet for the carpet, we can calculate the width of the room as follows:

Width = Area of carpet / Width of room
= 14 sq ft / 7 ft
= 2 ft

Therefore, the width of the living room is approximately 2 feet."
"Response:  If the living room is 7 feet wide and needs a rug that is 14 feet long, we can calculate the length of the living room as follows:

Length of living room = Length of rug / Width of rug
= 14 ft / 7 ft
= 2

So, the length of the living room is approximately 2 times the width of the rug, which in this case is 2 x 7 = 14 feet."
Response:  Firstly, we need to convert the measurements from feet and inches to square feet. The length of the room is 11 x 3 = 33 square feet, and the width is 15 x 2 = 30 square feet. Now, we have a total area of 33 + 30 = 63 square feet for the room. Next, we need to divide this area by the size of each floor mat. If each floor mat covers an area of 6 square feet, then we will need 63 / 6 = 10.5 floors of floor mats to cover the entire room. Therefore, there will be 11 floors of floor mats needed to cover the room.
Response:  If each room is 2 meters long and 4 meters wide, then the area of each room is 8 square meters (2 x 4 = 8). Since there are 10 rooms in total, the total area of all the rooms is 80 square meters (10 x 8 = 80). Now, we need to find out how many square meters of floor tiles are needed to cover the entire ground floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the rooms by the size of one tile. For example, if each tile measures 1 meter by 1 meter, then we would need 80 tiles (80 / 1 = 80) to cover the entire ground floor. Therefore, the answer is 80 tiles.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of the room based on its length and width. The length is 6 meters and the width is 7 meters, so the area of each room is: Area = Length x Width = 6 x 7 = 42 square meters. Now, we have to cover each room with carpeting, which means we need to divide the total area of the rooms by the size of one carpet. Suppose each carpet has a size of 1 meter x 1.5 meters (which is a common size for a small living room). Therefore, the number of carpets needed to cover all the rooms is: Number of Carpets = Total Area / Size of Each Carpet = 42 square meters / 1 meter x 1.5 meters = 28 carpets. So, there will be 28 carpets needed to cover all the rooms in this case.
Response:  The width of the room is 6 feet, and the length is 7 feet. To find out how long the room is, we can multiply the width by the number of feet in 1 foot (which is 12). So, the length of the room is: 6 feet x 12 = 72 feet. Therefore, the length of the room is 72 feet.
Response:  Since Jesse needs a 10 square foot area to cover her room, we know that the length of the room is equal to the width times 10 divided by the square root of 10. So if the length of the room is 5 feet, then the width must be 20 feet (5 x 10 / sqrt(10)).
"Response:  Since Jesse needs a carpet that is 10 square feet in size to cover her room, we know that the length of the room must be at least 10 feet.  If the width of the room is 2 feet, then the length of the room can be calculated as follows:
Length = Width x Area Required / Total Area
= 2 x 10 / 12 (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
= 8 feet
Therefore, Jesse's room is approximately 8 feet long."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the room in square feet. The length of the room is given as 1 meter, which is equal to 3.28084 feet. The width of the room is given as 6 meters, which is equal to 19.68508 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 3.28084 x 19.68508 = 67.62 sq ft Now, we are asked how many layers of carpet will be needed to cover the floor of the room. We can assume that each layer of carpet covers an area of 1/8th of the total area of the room (since there are 8 sides to a rectangular room). So, the number of layers of carpet needed to cover the entire floor of the room is: Number of layers = Total area / Area per layer = 67.62 sq ft / 0.125 sq ft per layer = 540 layers Of course, this assumes that the carpet is laid out flat and without any gaps between the layers. If there are gaps between the layers or if the carpet is not laid out perfectly flat, then more layers may be needed.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each shirt sold for $23. Then, we are told that there were 15 sales in total. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling these shirts is: 15 x $23 = $345 So, the number of T-shirts sold is: $345 / $23 = 14.62 (round to the nearest whole number) So, the person sold 15 T-shirts.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money earned from selling three T-shirts is $51.  Next, we need to find out how much each T-shirt costs.  We can do this by dividing the total amount of money earned by the number of T-shirts sold.  So, if we divide $51 by 3, we get $17 per T-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in Arkansas, each T-shirt is sold for $87. In addition, during the competition period in Arkansas and Texas, a total of 95 T-shirts were sold. Therefore, the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts in Arkansas is: 95 x $87 = $8325. Now, let's calculate the number of T-shirts sold in Texas:  During the competition period in Texas, 47 T-shirts were sold. So, the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts in Texas is: 47 x $87 = $4069. Finally, to find out how much money was earned from selling T-shirts in both states, we need to subtract the cost of selling T-shirts in Texas from the total revenue generated in Arkansas: $8325 - $4069 = $4256. Therefore, the answer is $4256.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of T-shirts sold in both states is 242. Then, we are given that in Arkansas, they sold 115 T-shirts, and in Texas, they sold 127 T-shirts. So, to find out how many T-shirts were sold in Texas, we can subtract the number of T-shirts sold in Arkansas from the total number of T-shirts sold: 242 - 115 = 127. Therefore, the number of T-shirts sold in Texas was 127.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of T-shirts sold in Arkansas is 163. Then, we are told that the store sold 89 T-shirts during the competition in Arkansas. Therefore, the difference between the total number of T-shirts sold and the number of T-shirts sold during the competition in Arkansas is 74 (163 - 89). Now, we need to find out how much money each T-shirt was sold for. According to the question, each T-shirt was sold for $98. So, if we multiply the number of T-shirts sold during the competition in Arkansas ($89) by the price of each T-shirt ($98), we get $8,522 (89 x $98 = $8,522). Finally, we add the amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during the competition in Arkansas ($8,522) to the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts throughout the entire trip ($10,305), which gives us a grand total of $18,827 ($10,305 + $8,522 = $18,827).
Response:  Firstly, we know that in Arkansas, they sold 186 T-shirts during the competition period. Then, we are asked how many T-shirts they sold in Texas if they sold 172 T-shirts there. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of T-shirts sold in Texas = Total number of T-shirts sold x Percentage of sales in Texas / 100 (Since we want to find out the percentage of sales in Texas) Percentage of sales in Texas = (Number of T-shirts sold in Texas / Total number of T-shirts sold) x 100 (Using the formula above) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Percentage of sales in Texas = (172 / 186) x 100 = 93.5% Therefore, they sold 93.5% of the total number of T-shirts in Texas.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each T-shirt costs $62 in the store in Arkansas and $99 in the store in Texas. Therefore, if we buy one T-shirt from the store in Arkansas, it will cost us $62. If we buy one T-shirt from the store in Texas, it will cost us $99. Now, let's consider how many T-shirts were sold during the competition period. According to the question, 183 T-shirts were sold in total, including 31 sportswear items. Since each T-shirt costs differently in different states, we need to calculate the number of T-shirts sold in each state separately. To do this, we can divide the total number of T-shirts sold (183) by the price per T-shirt in each state (Arkansas: $62; Texas: $99). This gives us: Number of T-shirts sold in Arkansas = 183 / $62 = 30 T-shirts Sold in Texas = 183 / $99 = 19 T-shirts So, there were 30 T-shirts sold in Arkansas and 19 T-shirts sold in Texas during the competition period."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each T-shirt is sold for $67 in the store A and $165 in store B. Therefore, if one buys six T-shirts from Store A, they will pay $67 x 6 = $392. Similarly, if one buys three T-shirts from Store B, they will pay $165 x 3 = $495. Now, let's move to the second part of the question. We are told that there were 74 T-shirts and 156 pieces of clothing (not including T-shirts) sold during the competition period in Arkansas. If we assume that all the T-shirts were sold at the higher price in Store B ($165), then the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts would be 74 x $165 = $12,090. However, since some T-shirts were sold at the lower price in Store A ($67), we need to subtract the revenue generated from those sales. The total revenue generated from selling T-shirts at the lower price in Store A would be 74 x $67 = $4,898. Therefore, the difference between the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts at the higher price in Store B and the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts at the lower price in Store A is: $12,090 - $4,898 = $7,202.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one T-shirt in Arkansas is $34, and in Texas it is $19. So, if we want to find out how much more expensive one T-shirt is in Texas compared to Arkansas, we can simply subtract the prices: $19 - $34 = -$15. Therefore, one T-shirt costs $15 less in Texas than in Arkansas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each T-shirt is sold for $86 in the store A and $232 in the store B. Therefore, we can calculate the price difference between the two stores as follows: Store A: $86 x 254 = $21,900 Store B: $232 x 43 = $9,780 Now, let's find out how much one baseball jersey costs compared to one T-shirt: Price ratio = ($9,780 / $21,900) = 0.44 or approximately 44% So, one baseball jersey costs about 44% more than one T-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each shirt costs $51. Then, in the competition, there are 130 shirts sold at a discount of $8 per shirt. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling these shirts is:  $51 x 130 = $6,430 So, the number of shirts sold is:  $6,430 / $8 = 800 shirts
Response:  Firstly, we know that each shirt costs $201 in Arkansas and $217 in Texas.  Therefore, if they sell 14 shirts in total, the total revenue from selling shirts is:  Revenue = Number of shirts x Price per shirt  Revenue = 14 x ($201 + $217) / 2  Revenue = $3,588  So, they sold 14 shirts and made a total revenue of $3,588.
Response:  According to the question, during the competition period in Arkansas and Texas, they sold 60 T-shirts per hour between the two states. If each T-shirt sells for $10, then how many T-shirts did they sell in total? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of T-shirts = Number of hours x Number of T-shirts per hour Total number of T-shirts = 60 x 2 (since they are from both Arkansas and Texas) Total number of T-shirts = 120 T-shirts So, they sold 120 T-shirts in total.
Response:  We know that there are five T-shirts and the total amount earned is $215. So, we can calculate the price of each T-shirt as follows:  Price of one T-shirt = Total amount earned / Number of T-shirts = $215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $43.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each T-shirt is sold for $250 and each basketball jersey is sold for $5 per piece. Therefore, if they sell 10 T-shirts and 20 basketball jerseys, their total revenue will be:  Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of basketball jerseys x Price of basketball jersey  Revenue = 10 x $250 + 20 x $5  Revenue = $2,500 + $100  Revenue = $2,600 So, they have sold $2,600 worth of products at the event.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each T-shirt is sold for $204 in Arkansas and $76 in Tennessee. Therefore, if they sell 158 T-shirts in total, they will make $31,960 from T-shirts ($204 x 158). Now, let's calculate how much they made from selling balls. Since each ball costs $76, if they sell 2 balls, they will make $152 from balls ($76 x 2). So, their total revenue is $31,960 + $152 = $32,112.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Company sells T-shirts for $240 each and baseball jerseys for $210 each during the Arkansas vs. Texas game period. Then, we are asked how much one T-shirt costs compared to one baseball jersey. To find out, we need to divide the price of the baseball jersey ($210) by the price of the T-shirt ($240). This gives us a ratio of 210/240 = 0.875 or approximately 90 cents per dollar. Therefore, one T-shirt costs about 90 cents more than one baseball jersey.
Response:  We know that each T-shirt is sold for $25 and each basketball jersey is sold for $115. So, we can calculate the price difference between them as follows: Price difference = $115 - $25 = $90 per basketball jersey. Therefore, one basketball jersey costs $90 more than one T-shirt.
Response:  If there are five groups of ten people each, then the total number of people is 5 x 10 = 50.  Therefore, more than 50 groups of ten people can fit in one large room.
Response:  If there are 12 chairs in the backyard and each table has an equal number of chairs, then the number of tables is also 12. So, if there are two groups of people hosting parties at different tables, then each group will have 6 tables (since 2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, each chair at each table will be occupied by 2 people ( since 6 x 2 = 12).
Response:  If there are nine tables in the backyard and each table has three chairs, then we have: Number of tables = 9 Tables per chair = 3 Chairs per table = 27 Total number of chairs = 9 x 3 = 27 So, there are 27 chairs in total.
Response:  If there are 11 people in each group and each group has 13 people in total, then we have:  Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group = 11 x 13 = 143 people. Therefore, if all 11 people in each group throw their own party, there will be 143 parties in total.
Response:  If there are 11 people sitting in the chairs and each chair has 6 seats, then we have a total of 11 x 6 = 66 seats taken up. This means that there are 66 - 11 = 55 empty seats left over.
Response:  We know that there are 12 chairs in each group and 6 extra chairs for guests. So, the total number of chairs is: 12 x 5 = 60 chairs. Now, we need to calculate how many positions can be accommodated based on the available chairs. Each chair can accommodate one person, so the maximum number of people who can attend the party is: 60 / 14 = 4.29 people per chair (round up to nearest whole number). Therefore, the total number of people who can attend the party is: 4.29 x 5 = 21.45 people.
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and each group has 3 chairs, then we need to buy 14 x 3 = 42 chairs in total.
"Response:  If there are 9 sets of dining tables and each set has 14 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. Now, we know that more than 126 chairs are provided because the passage states ""every table has 14 chairs."" Therefore, the correct answer is (more than) 126."
Response:  If Easy earned $460 in total over 5 weeks, that means he earned an average of $92 per week. So, his weekly income is $92.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest season. If he earns $16 per day, how many days did it take him to earn that amount? Solution: To find out how many days it took Lewis to earn $1216, we can divide the total amount he earned by his daily income. So, $1216 ÷ $16 = 78 days. Therefore, Lewis earned $1216 in 78 days.
Response:  If he earns $260 per week and pays $702 in taxes every quarter, then his total income for one year is: $260 x 52 = $13,280. So, after paying taxes, he will have: $13,280 - $702 = $12,578 left.
"Response:  If Easy earns $1357 per week for 22 weeks during the harvest season, that means he earned a total of:

$1357 x 22 = $29,044

Now, if he works for 73 consecutive weeks during the harvest season, his total earnings would be:

$29,044 x 73 = $2,068,692

Therefore, Easy will earn approximately $2,068,692 in 73 consecutive weeks during the harvest season."
Response:  Louis earns $28 per hour and works for 40 hours in a week. Therefore, his weekly income is:  $$ \text {Weekly income} = \text {Hourly wage} \times \text{Number of hours worked} $$ $$ \text {Weekly income} = 28 \times 40 = 1120 \text { dollars} $$ Now, let's assume that Louis works overtime every week and earns $50 per hour extra. So, his total weekly income including overtime is: $$ \text {Total weekly income} = \text {Weekly income} + \text {Overtime income} $$ $$ \text {Total weekly income} = 1120 + (50 \times 10) = 1270 \text { dollars} $$ Since Louis works 1091 hours in a year, his annual income is: $$ \text {Annual income} = \text {Yearly hours worked} \times \text {Total weekly income} $$ $$ \text {Annual income} = 1091 \times 1270 = 136,910 \text { dollars} $$ Therefore, if Louis works overtime every week, he will earn an additional $136,910 in a year.
Response:  If there are 233 weeks in a year and each week has $49 rent, then the total rent for one year is: 233 weeks x $49/week = $10,877. So, if the person earns $10,877 per year in rent, they will have earned $10,877 x 52 weeks/year (assuming a standard calendar year) = $560,524 in a year.
Response:  Louis pays $388 per week for rent, which is equivalent to $1,640 per month ($388 x 4 weeks). Since he receives $1,359 every two weeks, he has $281 left over after paying his rent each time ($1,359 - $1,640 = $281). Therefore, in order to calculate how much money Louis will have at the end of the period, we need to subtract the amount he spends on rent from the total amount he receives: $281 + $281 +... + $281 = $13,590 (the number of times he receives $281). So, Louis will have $13,590 at the end of the period.
"Response:  Louis earns $491 per week and works for 1181 weeks until he retires. If he pays $216 in rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of his working life?

Step 1: Calculate the total amount earned during Louis's working life.
Total amount earned = Number of weeks worked x Weekly income
= 1181 x $491
= $573,011

Step 2: Subtract the total amount spent on rent to find out Louis's savings.
Savings = Total amount earned - Total amount spent on rent
= $573,011 - (1181 x $216)
= $455,805

Therefore, Louis will have $455,805 at the end of his working life after paying $216 in rent every week for 1181 weeks."
Response:  Louis worked for 19 weeks and earned $133 in total. To find out how much he earned per week, we can divide the total amount by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Louis earned $7 per week.
Response:  Louis earns $2 for each hour he works, and he works every week for 5 hours. So, in one week, he earns $10 (2 x 5 = 10). If he earned $178 in total, then he worked for X weeks, where X is the number of weeks it takes him to earn that amount. We can set up an equation based on this information: X = $\frac{178}{10}$ = 17.8 weeks. Therefore, Louis worked for 17.8 weeks to earn the $178 he mentioned in the question.
Response:  If Dylan is 9 feet tall and the water depth is ten times his height, then... (1) The water depth is equal to 90 feet. (2) Now, we need to find out how much deeper the water is compared to Dylan's height. So, we subtract Dylan's height from the water depth: 90 - 9 = 81 feet. Therefore, the water depth is 81 feet deeper than Dylan's height.
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water is twice as deep as Draco's height, which is 8 feet (2.4 meters) shorter than Longbottom's height of 10 feet (3 meters). If Ron's water level is at 14 feet (4.3 meters), how deep is the water?
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water depth is 5 times that of Dean, who is 11 feet tall. If Ron's water level is 12 feet, how deep is the water?  Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the water depth as follows: Water depth = 5 x (Dean's height) = 5 x 11 = 55 feet So, the water depth is 55 feet.
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water depth is 15 times higher than Dean's height. If Ron's water level is 13 feet, how deep is the water?  Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the water depth as follows: Water depth = 15 x Height of Dean = 15 x 4 feet = 60 feet Therefore, the water depth is 60 feet.
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, which means it is 9 feet deep for Dane. If Ron's water level is at 13 feet, how deep is the water?  Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate that the depth of the water is 20 feet (13 feet + 7 feet).
Response:  Dean is nine times taller than Rooney, so if Rooney is 5 feet tall, then Dean is 45 feet tall (9 x 5 = 45). Now, we know that the water is 10 times deeper than Dean, so if he can touch the bottom with his hands at a depth of 45 feet, then the water must be at least 450 feet deep (10 x 45 = 450). Therefore, the water is at least 450 feet deep.
Response:  If there are 34 books in total and we want to distribute them evenly across 2 bookshelves, each bookshelf will have how many books?  We can divide 34 by 2 to get our answer: 34 / 2 = 17 So, each bookshelf will have 17 books.
"Response:  If there are 42 books in total and each bookshelf has 2 books, then we have:

Number of bookshelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 42 / 2
= 21

So, there are 21 bookshelves in total."
Response:  If there are 27 books and 80 magazines in total, that means each bookshelf has an average of 23 books (27 / 80). So, the number of books on each shelf is 23 x 80 = 1860 books. Therefore, the total number of books is 1860 + 27 = 1887 books.
Response:  If there are nine books and each book has four shelves, then there will be a total of 9 x 4 = 36 shelves for all the books. Now, if there are forty-six magazines and each magazine is placed on one of these shelves, then we can calculate the number of magazines on each shelf as follows:  Number of magazines on each shelf = Total number of magazines / Number of shelves So, the number of magazines on each shelf will be:  Number of magazines on each shelf = 40 (magazines) / 36 (shelves) = 1.11 (approximately 11 magazines per shelf). Therefore, in total, there will be approximately 11 magazines on each of the 36 shelves.
Response:  If there are 23 books and 61 magazines, then together they have a total of 84 bookshelves (23 x 61 = 1453). Now, if each shelf has 29 books and magazines, then the total number of books and magazines will be: 1453 x 29 = 40791. Therefore, there are 40791 books and magazines in total.
Response:  If there are seven bookshelves and each bookshelf has the same number of books, then the total number of books is 7 x 28 = 196 books. So, if Brian has 28 books, he must have at least 196 - 28 = 168 books in his other six bookshelves.
Response:  If there are 38 books in total and each shelf has two books, then we can calculate the number of shelves as follows: Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf = 38 / 2 = 19 shelves. Therefore, there are 19 shelves in total.
"Response:  If Carol has invited ten friends to her birthday party and each invitation card has two envelopes inside, then the total number of envelopes needed is:

10 friends x 2 envelopes per friend = 20 envelopes

So, if Carol buys them all, she will need 20 envelopes in total to ensure that none of her friends are forgotten."
Response:  Since Carol sent out 12 friendship invitation cards, and each card has multiple invitations (we don't know how many), we can calculate the total number of invitations as follows:  Number of invitations = Total number of friendship invitation cards x Number of invitations per card  In this case, the total number of invitations is:  Number of invitations = 12 x?  Where? represents the unknown number of invitations per card.  We are asked to find out the value of?.  Therefore, the answer is: ? = 3  Because Carol bought 3 gift boxes, and each box contains multiple invitation cards.
Response:  If Carol sent out ten invitation letters and bought seven of them back, that means she has three unused invitation letters left over. So, if she only sends two invitation letters to her friends, there will be one letter left over. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Carol sent out 14 invitation cards to her friends for her birthday party. She then bought 6 of them back. So, the number of invitation cards she has left is 14 - 6 = 8.  Since she can invite multiple people per card, and she has 8 invitation cards remaining, she can invite up to 8 x (number of people she can invite per card) = 8 x 4 = 32 people to her birthday party.
Response:  If Carol wants to invite 9 friends for her birthday party and each invitation card has three invitation cards inside, she needs to buy 9 x 3 = 27 invitation cards in total. So, Carol needs to buy 27 invitation cards.
Response:  If Melissa gets 12 points in each game and has a total of 36 points, then she must have played __________ games. (Note: The blank represents the number of games.)
Response:  If Melissa has played three games and scored 81 points in total, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81 / 3 = 27).
"Response:  If Melissa scores 109 points in each game and wins $82 for every win, then she has won a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{79} \frac{109}{2} \times \frac{82}{2} $$

where $\frac{109}{2}$ is the number of points Melissa scored per game, and $\frac{82}{2}$ is the amount of prize money she won per game.

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{79} \frac{546}{2} $$

Therefore, Melissa has won a total of $546$ in all 79 games."
Response:  According to the question, Melissa has scored a total of 21 points in all the games she played. Since each game is worth 7 points, we can calculate the number of games as follows: Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 games Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in each of the 13 games, then she totalled 91 x 13 = 1123 points for all the games combined.
Response:  If there are four seats in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can sit at the same time, then each seat can accommodate 5 people (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If there are 18 people who can sit in the Ferris wheel at the same time, and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then we need to know how many seats are available in total. We can calculate this as follows: Number of seats = Total number of people x Number of people per seat So, in this case, we have: Number of seats = 18 x 9 = 162 seats Therefore, there are 162 seats available in the Ferris wheel for all 18 people to sit at the same time.
Response:  Each big wheel has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people. So, in total, we have 19 x 15 = 285 seats available for all 20 big wheels. Since each person can ride only one big wheel at a time, the maximum number of people who can ride simultaneously is 285 / 20 = 14 people. Therefore, the answer is 14.
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is:

18 seats x 15 people/seat = 270 people

So, if 10 seats are broken, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at one time is:

270 people - 10 seats = 260 people"
"Response:  If there are six seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 14 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is:

6 seats x 14 people/seat = 84 people

Now, if there are already 16 people in the Ferris wheel, that means we have reached the maximum capacity of 84 people. Therefore, no more people can join the Ferris wheel."
Response:  We know that there are two types of seats in the Ferris wheel: small seats (23) and large seats (14). So, we have a total of 37 seats (23 + 14 = 37). Now, each seat can accommodate 5 people, so the total number of people who can sit on the Ferris wheel is 37 x 5 = 185 people. Therefore, the answer is 185 people.
Response:  There are three small seats and seven large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, while each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, the total number of people who can sit on the Ferris wheel is: 3 x 16 = 48 + 7 x 12 = 84. Therefore, there can be up to 84 people sitting on the Ferris wheel at any given time.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can simultaneously ride in Heavenly Park, and each person needs to sit on a Ferris wheel with four seats, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit on each seat. So, the answer is 16/4 = 4. Therefore, each seat on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 4 people.
Response:  Since there are four people in total, each seat can accommodate two people. Therefore, the number of seats is: 4 x 2 = 8 seats.
"Response:  If there are 7 slices per pizza and we have 14 pizzas in total, then the number of slices overall is:

7 x 14 = 98

So, there are 98 slices in total."
"Response:  If there are 28 pieces of pizza and each piece has two slices, then we have:

Number of slices = Total number of pieces x Number of slices per piece
= 28 x 2
= 56 slices

Therefore, we have 56 slices of pizza in total."
Response:  If there are 17 pieces of pizza and each piece has four slices, then the total number of slices is: 17 x 4 = 68 slices.  Since there are 25 people, the number of slices each person will get is: 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices per person.
Response:  If there are 9 pieces of pizza and each piece has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices.  Now, if we divide them equally between two people, each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices of pizza.
Response:  If there are 45 flowers and each flower has ten seeds, then the total number of seeds is:  45 x 10 = 450 seeds.
Response:  If there are 9 flowers in each pot and we want to plant an equal number of seeds for each flower, then we will need to plant 45 seeds in total. So, if we have x pots, we can calculate the number of seeds needed as follows: Number of seeds = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot = 9 x 45 = 375 seeds. Therefore, if we have x pots, we will need to plant 375/x seeds in each pot.
Response:  We know that there are 36 types of flowers and each flower has ten seeds inside it. So, in total, we have 36 x 10 = 360 seeds. Now, only 58 seeds grew into flowers, which means that 360 - 58 = 292 seeds did not grow into flowers. Therefore, there are 292 flowers.
Response:  We know that there are 55 types of flowers and each flower has 15 seeds inside. So, in total, we have 55 x 15 = 825 seeds. Now, only 60 flowers grew, which means that some seeds did not grow into flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers grown is 60 / 825 = 0.73 or approximately 73%.
Response:  If there are 10 seeds in each flower pot and they all germinate, then we have 10 x 60 = 600 seeds in total. Since each seed can produce multiple flowers, let's assume that each flower produces an average of 3 flowers (this is just an estimate, as it can vary depending on the plant). Therefore, the number of flowers produced would be 600 / 3 = 200 flowers. So, there will be 200 flowers in total.
Response:  If there are 8 flowers and each flower has 32 seeds, then the total number of seeds is 8 x 32 = 256 seeds.  Now, if we want to distribute these seeds equally among all 8 flowers, we need to divide 256 by 8, which gives us an average of 32 seeds per flower. So, each flower will have 32 seeds.
Response:  If Matthew has 3 cookies and he wants to share them equally among his 11 friends, then each friend will get 0.27 cookies (3 / 11).  So, Matthew has 3 x 11 = 33 cookies in total.
Response:  If Matthew has eight cakes to share among his friends and he gives two cakes to each friend, then he will have how many cakes left after giving them all away?  Solution:  To find out how many cakes Matthew has left after giving them all away, we need to subtract the number of cakes he gave to each friend from the total number of cakes he had. So, if he has eight cakes in total and he gives two cakes to each of four friends, then he will have how many cakes left?  Answer:  Four (8 - 4 = 4).
Response:  If Matthew has 15 pieces of candy and he wants to share them equally among his 5 friends, each friend will get 3 pieces of candy (15 / 5 = 3).  However, since there are still 10 pieces of candy left after Matthew shared them with his friends, each remaining friend will get 2 pieces of candy (10 / 5 = 2).
Response:  If Matthew has 24 cookies and he divides them equally among three friends, each friend will get 8 cookies (24 / 3 = 8). Now, if Matthew gives 5 cookies to one of his friends, that friend will have 13 cookies left (8 + 5 = 13). So, Matthew gave 5 cookies to 1 friend.
"Response:  If Matthew has 22 pieces of bread and 34 pieces of cake, and he wants to divide them equally among his 11 friends, then each friend will get:

Bread: 22 / 11 = 2 pieces of bread per person
Cake: 34 / 11 = 3 pieces of cake per person
Therefore, each person will eat 2 + 3 = 5 pieces of food in total."
"Response:  If Matthew has 29 pieces of cake and 30 eggs, and he wants to divide them equally among his two friends, then each friend will get:

Cake: 29 / 2 = 14 pieces of cake per friend
Eggs: 30 / 2 = 15 eggs per friend

So, each friend will eat 14 pieces of cake and 15 eggs."
"Response:  If Matthew has 14 bread rolls and 21 cakes, and he wants to share them equally among his 7 friends, then each friend will get:

Bread rolls: 14 / 7 = 2 per person
Cakes: 21 / 7 = 3 per person

So, each of Matthew's 7 friends will receive 2 bread rolls and 3 cakes in total."
Response:  If Matthew has 36 chocolate cookies and wants to share them equally among his 18 friends, each friend will get how many cookies?  To find out, we can divide 36 by 18: 36 / 18 = 2. So each friend will get 2 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew has 36 song choices and he wants to share them equally among his 7 friends, then each friend will get:  36 / 7 = 5 songs per friend.
Response:  Since Matthew gave each of his two friends an equal number of cookies (23), and he has 11 leftover, that means he gave them a total of 46 cookies (2 x 23 = 46). So, each friend got half of those cookies, which is 23 cookies per person.
Response:  We know that Matthew has 31 cookies and wants to share them equally among 5 friends. So, we need to divide 31 by 5 = 6.2 (rounded up to nearest whole number). Therefore, each friend will get 6 cookies from Matthew.
Response:  If Matthew has 32 chocolate cookies and wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 8 cookies (32 / 4 = 8). Now, if he also wants to share the pancakes equally among his friends, each friend will get 23 pancakes (98 / 4 = 23).
Response:  If Matthew has 10 chocolate cookies and wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 2.5 cookies (10 / 4 = 2.5).  Now, if he also wants to share the pudding equally among his friends, each friend will get 2 cups of pudding (8 / 4 = 2).
"Response:  If Matthew has 28 friends and he wants to divide an equal number of cookies and cakes among them, then we can assume that each friend will get an equal share of both cookies and cakes. So, if Matthew initially had 13 cookies and 15 cakes, then each friend will receive:

Cookies: 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 4-5 cookies per person)
Cakes: 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 5-6 cakes per person)"
Response:  If he drinks 109 bottles of wine in one day and each bottle can be used for 74 days, then we need to calculate how many bottles he buys. We know that he buys water bottles, not wine bottles, so we have to convert the number of wine bottles to water bottles. There are 74 days in a week, so if he drinks 109 bottles of wine in one day, it means he drinks 109/7 = 15.6 bottles of wine per week. Since he buys water bottles, let's assume he buys 1 bottle of water per week. Therefore, he buys 1 bottle / 15.6 bottles per week = 0.064 bottles per day. Now, since he has been drinking for 30 years, we need to multiply the number of bottles he buys per day by 30 years: 0.064 bottles per day x 30 years = 1.848 bottles. So, he buys approximately 1.85 bottles of water every day for 30 years.
"Response:  If one bottle of wine can last for 17 days at a daily drinking amount of 153 bottles per day, then we need to calculate how many bottles of wine are consumed each day:

$$ \text {Number of bottles of wine consumed per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of bottles of wine available}}{\text{Daily drinking amount}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bottles of wine consumed per day}} = \frac{153}{\text{17}} = 9 } $$
Therefore, the person consumes 9 bottles of wine per day."
Response:  Debbie bought 264 bottles of water and drank one bottle every ten days. Therefore, she has drunk 26 bottles so far (10 x 26 = 260). So, there are 264 - 26 = 238 bottles left.
Response:  If he drank 144 bottles of water in one day, and there were originally 301 bottles, then we can calculate how many days it would take him to finish them all as follows: Number of bottles left = 301 - 144 = 157 So, if he drinks 157 bottles per day, it will take him approximately 2 days to finish all the original 301 bottles. Therefore, the answer is 2 days.
Response:  If David drinks 88 bottles of water in one day and he has 13 bottles of soy milk left, then he can use those 13 bottles for how many days?  To calculate this, we need to divide the number of bottles of soy milk he has (13) by the number of days he drank water (88). So, David can use his remaining soy milk for approximately 7 days (13 / 88 = 0.15 or 15%).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soy milk in total. If one person drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soy milk per day, then the number of days they can last with only soy milk is:

Number of days = Total amount of soy milk / Amount of soy milk consumed per day
= 256 bottles / 4 bottles
= 64 days

Therefore, if the person continues to consume only soy milk for those many days, they will eventually run out of soy milk."
Response:  If he can drink six bottles of alcohol per day and buys twelve barrels, we need to calculate how many days it will last him.  We know that one barrel contains 42 bottles (since each barrel has 42 bottles), so he bought 12 x 42 = 508 bottles in total. Therefore, if he drinks six bottles per day, it will last him for 508 / 6 = 84.67 days. So, he will be able to drink alcohol for approximately 85 days.
Response:  If David drinks 15 bottles of water (95 bottles) in one day and he has 180 bottles of water in total, then he has 180 - 95 = 85 bottles left.  Now, if he continues to drink at the same rate, he will finish all his remaining water in 85 / 15 = 5 days. Therefore, David can use his water for 5 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David drank 122 bottles of water in one day, and he had 360 bottles of water in total. So, the percentage of water he drank is (122/360) x 100% = 34%.  Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take for him to finish drinking all 360 bottles of water if he continues at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of bottles by the number of bottles he drank in one day: (360/34%) = approximately 10.5 days. Therefore, it will take David around 10.5 days to finish drinking all 360 bottles of water if he continues at his current rate of consumption.
"Response:  If Faye has 14 rows and each row has 11 columns, then the total number of pens she has is:

14 rows x 11 columns per row = 154 pens (not including the blank space)

So, Faye has 154 pens in total."
Response:  If we have 12 pens and want to arrange them in three rows, each row can hold how many pens?  We know that there are 4 pens in each row, so the total number of pens in one row is 4 x 3 = 12 pens. Therefore, if we arrange 12 pens in three rows, each row will contain 12 pens / 3 = 4 pens.
Response:  Since there are 28 pens in total and each row has 16 pens, we can have at most $28 / 16 = 1 \text{ row}$.  Therefore, Faye can arrange her pens in at most $1$ row.
"Response:  We know that Faye has six rows of pens with 22 pens in each row. Therefore, the total number of pens Faye has is:
6 rows x 22 pens/row = 132 pens Total Number of Pens: 132
So, Faye has 132 pens."
"Response:  If Faye has 35 pens in one row and 7 pens in another row, she can arrange them in different ways to make 3 rows of 5 pens each. Here are some possible arrangements:

Row 1: 35 pens (F)
Row 2: 7 pens (E)
Row 3: 35 pens (F)

So, there are 3 rows with 5 pens in each row, making a total of 15 rows."
Response:  Firstly, we have 19 rows in total. Each row has 4 pens, so the total number of pens is 19 x 4 = 76 pens. Therefore, there are 76 pens in total.
Response:  If we have 7 rows of 36 pens each (total = 252 pens), and then we remove 30 pens from one row, there will be 222 pens left in that row. So, the number of groups of pens after removing 30 pens is 222 / 7 = 31 groups.
Response:  We have 11 rows and each row has 31 columns, so we have a total of 341 cells in the table (11 x 31 = 341). Now, let's count how many pairs of adjacent cells have the same value.  There are 27 pairs of adjacent cells that have the same value (27 x 2 = 54). Therefore, there are 54 pairs of adjacent cells that have the same value among all 341 cells in the table.
"Response:  Since there are 30 pens in total and each row has 5 pens, we can arrange them into rows as follows:

Row 1: 5 pens (Pen 1, Pen 2, Pen 3, Pen 4, Pen 5)
Row 2: 5 pens (Pen 6, Pen 7, Pen 8, Pen 9, Pen 10)
...
Row 30: 5 pens (Pen 30, Pen 31, Pen 32, Pen 33, Pen 34)
Therefore, Faye can arrange 30 pens into 6 rows of 5 pens each."
"Response:  If Faye has 6 pens and wants to arrange them in two rows of equal length, we can find the number of pens each row will have as follows:

Row 1: Since there are 6 pens in total, Row 1 will have 3 pens (6 / 2 = 3).

Row 2: Now, since Row 1 already has 3 pens, Row 2 will have 3 pens as well (6 - 3 = 3).

Therefore, Faye will have 3 pens in each row."
Response:  Since there are 35 pencils in total and each pencil has 4 parts, we have a total of 35 x 4 = 140 parts. Now, if we arrange them into two rows with two pencils each, we have 2 x 2 = 4 pencils in each row. Therefore, he can arrange them into 4 rows.
Response:  If there are 31 packets of pens and each packet contains 6 pens, then the total number of pens is 31 x 6 = 186 pens. Now, if he arranges them in rows of 19 pens each, then he will have 19 rows. Therefore, the number of rows he has is 19. So, the answer is 19.
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 pens and she wants to arrange them in 7 rows of 4 pens each. Since there are 24 pens in total, we can calculate the number of pens per row as follows: Number of pens per row = Total number of pens / Number of rows = 24 / 7 = 3.5 pens per row Now, let's count how many pens Faye has in each row: Row 1: 4 pens x 4 pens/row = 16 pens Row 2: 4 pens x 3.5 pens/row = 14 pens Row 3: 4 pens x 3.5 pens/row = 14 pens... (continued) Therefore, Faye has 16 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 16 = 80 pens in total.
Response:  Firstly, we have 16 rows in total. Each row has 6 columns, so the number of cells in each row is 6 x 16 = 96. Therefore, the total number of cells in all 16 rows is 96 x 16 = 1536. So, Faye has 1536 pens.
"Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in this school and 98 students will participate in the outdoor trip. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 7 passengers, we need to divide 98 by 7 to find out how many buses are needed for the entire group. Therefore, the number of buses required is:

$$ \boxed{98 \div 7 = 14} $$
So, there will be 14 buses for the entire group."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 84 classrooms in this school. Since each classroom can accommodate 30 students (as mentioned in the problem), then the total number of students in this school is:

Number of classrooms = 84
Capacity per classroom = 30
Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity per classroom
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
Therefore, there are approximately 2520 students in this school."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. We know that there are 67 classrooms and each classroom has 66 students, so the total number of students is:

67 x 66 = 4282 students

Next, we need to calculate how many buses are needed for the field trip. Since each bus can seat 6 people, we need:

4282 / 6 = 713 seats

So, we need at least 713 buses for the field trip."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 classrooms in this school and each classroom has 58 students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 87 x 58 = 4960 students. Now, we need to find out how many buses are needed for the field trip. Since each bus can accommodate 2 students per seat, we need (4960 / 2) = 248 buses. So, the school needs 248 buses for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in this school and each classroom has an equal number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is 24 x 120 = 2880 students. Since each bus can seat 84 students, we have 2880 / 84 = 35 buses for transportation. So, each bus carries approximately 35 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 66 classrooms in this school and 102 students attending it. Since each classroom has 8 seats per car, we have a total of 66 x 8 = 532 seats available for transportation. Now, let's assume that 22 students do not want to go to class. To calculate how many cars they need to take, we divide the number of remaining seats (532 - 22 = 510) by 8, which gives us approximately 64 cars needed to accommodate all the students who want to attend classes. Therefore, the answer is 64 cars.
Response:  Since there are 102 classrooms in this school, and each classroom has 30 students (on average), then the total number of students in the school is 102 x 30 = 3060 students.  Now, let's assume that 8 students do not want to go on the field trip. Therefore, the number of students who will go on the field trip is 3060 - 8 = 3052 students.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in this school and each classroom has 3 seats per bus. Therefore, we need to divide 111 students among these 72 classrooms. To do this, we can use division. So, we will divide 111 by 72 to get the number of students per classroom. This gives us approximately 1.58 students per classroom (or about 160 students total). Since each bus can seat 3 passengers, we will need approximately 50 buses (160 / 3 = 50) to transport all 111 students to school.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms in this school and 92 students. If all buses are full, then each bus has how many seats? To find out, we need to divide the number of students by the number of classrooms. So, if there are 92 students and 17 classrooms, then each bus can carry approximately 5.3 students (92 / 17 = 5.3). Since there are 46 buses, each bus can carry approximately 46 x 5.3 = 240.6 students. Therefore, each bus has approximately 241 seats.
Response:  If Harry has 9 marbles and he gives each of them to one of the boys in her class, then how many marbles will Harry have after giving them away?  Well, if there are 10 boys in total (including Harry himself), then Harry will give away 9 x 10 = 90 marbles in total. So, after giving them away, Harry will have 9 - 90 = -81 marbles!  Therefore, the answer is -81.
Response:  If there are n male students in the class and each of them gets 5 beads from Hong Li, then the total number of beads given out is 5n. Since Hong Li has 10 beads to begin with, she will have 10 - 5n beads left after giving away all the beads. So, the number of male students who received beads is equal to the number of beads Hong Li has left, which is 10 - 5n. Therefore, the answer is 10 - 5n.
Response:  There are 4 boys in total, and each boy wants to get 15 beads. So, how many beads will each boy get if there are only 23 beads in total?  Each boy will get 15/4 = 3.75 beads. Since you cannot have a fraction of a bead, each boy will get 4 beads. Therefore, the number of beads that each boy will get is 4.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who want to play with marbles and 50 boys who want to play cards, then each boy will have an equal chance of getting either marbles or cards. So, the probability of any one boy getting marbles is 1/2 (or 50%), and the probability of any one boy getting cards is also 1/2 (or 50%). Now, let's calculate how many marbles each boy can get if there are 26 marbles in total. Since there are 13 boys playing with marbles, each boy has a 1/13 chance of getting at least one marble. Therefore, the expected number of marbles each boy gets is 13 x 1/13 = 1 marble. Similarly, since there are 50 boys playing with cards, each boy has a 1/50 chance of getting at least one card. Therefore, the expected number of cards each boy gets is 50 x 1/50 = 1 card. In conclusion, each boy will get approximately 1 marble and 1 card.
Response:  Since there are 20 marbles in total and Harry wants to divide them equally among his classmates, each boy will get 5 marbles (20/4 = 5). If Harry then divides the remaining 16 marbles into two equal parts, each part will have 8 marbles (16/2 = 8). Therefore, the second boy will receive 8 marbles.
Response:  There are 5 boys in total in Haley's class. Each boy is given 2 marbles to play with. Since there are 5 boys and each boy has 2 marbles, the total number of marbles given out is 10 (5 x 2 = 10). Now, we need to find out how many boys have exactly 28 small blocks if they have 10 marbles each. To do this, we can divide the total number of marbles by the number of marbles each boy has: 10 / 2 = 5. So, there are 5 boys who have exactly 28 small blocks each.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 14 pages every day and there are 392 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to read the book, we can divide the number of pages he read by the number of pages per day: Number of days = Total pages / Daily pages = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Frank used 27 days to write the book.
Response:  If Frank reads 22 pages every day and it takes him 569 days to finish reading the book, then we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Number of pages = Total pages / Days taken to read the book In this case, the total pages in the book are 569 days \* 22 pages/day = 12,378 pages So, there are approximately 12,378 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that Frank has 612 pages in his book and he wants to read it within 6 days. So, we can calculate how many pages he needs to read each day:  Number of pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days = 612 pages / 6 days = 102 pages per day Now, let's see how long it would take him to finish reading one page: Time taken to read one page = Number of pages per day x Time taken to read one page = 102 pages/day x (How much time does Frank have each day?) = How much time does Frank have each day? Therefore, if Frank has 24 chapters in his book, we can calculate how long it would take him to finish reading each chapter: Time taken to read one chapter = Number of pages per chapter x Time taken to read one page = (Number of pages per chapter) x (Time taken to read one page) = (Let's assume each chapter has 30 pages) x (102 pages/day) = 3078 minutes or approximately 50.6 hours To summarize, Frank can finish reading his entire book within 6 days with an average reading speed of 102 pages per day, assuming he has 24 chapters in his book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to complete the book with 555 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages per chapter as follows: Number of chapters = Total pages / Time taken to complete the book Chapter length = Total pages / Number of chapters Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Total pages = 555 Chapters = 220 / 555 = 0.4 (or approximately 4) So, each chapter has around 4 pages on average.
Response:  Since there are 15 chapter sections in the book, and Frank took 660 days to complete it, we can calculate the number of chapters he could read per day as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of chapters x Time taken to complete the book / Number of days taken to finish the book Chapter reading speed = Total number of chapters / Time taken to complete the book  In this case, the total number of chapters is 193, and Frank took 660 days to complete the book. So, if we divide the total number of chapters by the time taken to complete the book, we get: Chapter reading speed = 193 / 660 = 0.29 (or approximately 1/4) chapters per day Now, let me explain why my answer is 0.29 instead of just rounding off to an integer like 1 or 0.5. When you divide a large number by a smaller one, rounding off may not always give you the most accurate result. For example, if you have 193 chapters and take 660 days to complete them, rounding off to the nearest whole number might make you think that Frank could read about 20 chapters per day. However, since the actual time taken to complete each chapter is not equal to the time taken to complete all the chapters, rounding off may not accurately represent how many chapters Frank could read in a single day. Therefore, I chose to use decimal numbers to ensure more accuracy in my calculation.
Response:  If Frank reads 249 pages of a book in three days, that means he reads an average of 83 pages per day (249 / 3 = 83).
Response:  According to the problem statement, Frank read each book for 66 pages in 12 days. Therefore, he read one book in 66/12 = 5.5 days. Now, if Frank used 492 days to read all the books, he would have read how many books?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of books = Total number of pages / Time taken to read one book  In this case, the total number of pages is 66 x 30 = 1980 pages. So, the number of books Frank read is: Number of books = 1980 pages / 5.5 days per book = 35.7 books (approximately)
"Response:  If it takes Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book, and there are 112 pages in the book, we can calculate how many pages he reads each day as follows:

Days = 16
Pages per day = Days x Number of pages / Total number of pages
= 16 x 112 / 112
= 10 pages per day
Therefore, Frank reads 10 pages of his favorite book each day for 16 days."
Response:  If Frank reads only eight pages per day, it means he will finish reading the book in 73 days (576 pages / 8 pages/day = 73 days).
Response:  We know that Frank has to read 41 chapters of a book with each chapter having 450 pages in total. To complete this task within 30 days, we can calculate how many pages he can read per day as follows:  Number of days = 30 Days  Total number of pages = 450 pages/chapter x 41 chapters = 18,500 pages Total time taken = 30 days x 24 hours/day = 720 hours Now, let's find out how many pages Frank can read per hour: Total pages/Total time = 18,500 pages / 720 hours = 26 pages/hour Therefore, Frank can read approximately 26 pages per hour.
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 607 days and there are three chapters in the book with a total of 1782 pages (3 x 594 pages). So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to complete the book In this case, the number of pages read per day is: Number of pages read per day = 1782 pages / 607 days = approximately 29 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to complete the book, and each chapter has 405 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the number of chapters as follows: Number of chapters = Total pages / Page per chapter = 405 pages/chapter x 12 (chapters per year) = 4860 chapters Now, let's find out how many days Frank spent reading each chapter: Time taken to read one chapter = Total time taken to complete the book / Number of chapters = 664 days / 4860 chapters = 0.137 days per chapter So, Frank could have read approximately 0.137 days per chapter.
"Response:  If we want to buy six DVD boxes for $120, then each box costs:

$120 / 6 = $20 per box

So each box costs $20."
"Response:  If each DVD costs $81, then buying 33 DVDs will cost:

$81 x 33 = $2690

So, buying 33 DVDs will require $2690."
Response:  If each DVD costs $107 and there is a discount of $106, then the price after discount is $1 = $106. Now we need to find out how many DVDs can be bought with $93. To do this, we divide $93 by $106, which gives us $\frac{93}{106} \approx 0.88$. So, approximately 88 DVDs can be bought with $93.
Response:  If each DVD costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 for each box, then we need to calculate how much one box costs after applying the discount. So, the cost of one box = $76 - ($25 x number of boxes) = $76 - ($25 x ) = $51 per box. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each box.
"Response:  If I have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many dollars are available for buying DVDs.
$104 - $26 = $78

Step 2: Calculate how many DVDs can be bought with the available money.
$78 / $26 = 3

So, if I have $104 and each DVD costs $26, I can buy 3 DVDs."
Response:  If we have $28 to spend, and there are two DVD boxes in total, then each box costs half of that amount or $\$14$.
"Response:  If there are 18 fragrances in total, and we want to divide them into two groups of equal size (i.e., 2 dimensions), then we can do so as follows:

Group 1: Fragrance 1 - Fragrance 9 (9 fragrances)
Group 2: Fragrance 10 - Fragrance 18 (9 fragrances)

So, there will be 9 fragrances in each group, for a total of 18 groups."
"Response:  If there are 140 sets of 187 pieces each, then we have:
Number of sets = 140 x 187 = 23,690
So, there are 23,690 different types of fragrances in Philip's collection."
Response:  First, we have 203 fragrances in total. Then, we divide them into 7 groups of 28 fragrances each (since there are 7 choices). Now, within each group, we further divide them into 95 sub-groups of 3 fragrances each (since there are 95 options for each sub-group). Therefore, the size of each sub-group is 3.
Response:  Firstly, Philip has 142 grains of incense, and he wants to divide them into 47 groups. So each group will have 142/47 = 3 grains of incense. Similarly, if we want to divide the remaining 356 grains among 178 groups, each group will have 356/178 = 2 grains of incense. Therefore, each grain of incense is divided into 3 or 2 depending on whether it belongs to Philip or not.
Response:  If Philip has collected 196 groups of fragrances and each group contains 392 fragrances, then we can calculate the number of fragrances in each group as follows: Number of fragrances per group = Total number of fragrances / Number of groups = 392 x 196 = 70,544 fragrances So, there are 70,544 fragrances in each group.
"Response:  If Philip has 180 different types of fragrances in his collection and he wants to arrange them into groups of 18 per class, then we need to divide 180 by 18 to find out how many groups there will be. So, the number of groups is:

180 / 18 = 10

Therefore, Philip's fragrance collection can be divided into 10 groups of 18 fragrances each."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Philip has 87 fruit seeds and he wants to divide them into two groups. Each group will have 93 sets of seeds. Therefore, the total number of sets of seeds is:

87 / 2 = 43.5 sets

Since each set contains 93 seeds, the total number of seeds in both groups is:

43.5 x 93 = 4161.5 seeds

Therefore, there are approximately 4161.5 seeds in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Philip has 384 marbles and 192 fragrances. If he wants to divide them into groups of 345 marble sets and 16 child sets, then we can calculate the number of marbles in each set as follows: Number of marbles in each set = Total number of marbles / Number of sets = 384 / 16 = 24 marbles per set Now, let's calculate the number of fragrances in each set: Number of fragrances in each set = Total number of fragrances / Number of sets = 192 / 16 = 12 fragrances per set Therefore, each child set contains 24 marbles and 12 fragrances.
Response:  If Brananda makes 38 pieces of glutinous rice cake and each piece has 19 layers, then we need to calculate how many people can eat them. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces (38) by the number of layers in each piece (19). So, the answer is: 38 / 19 = 2. Therefore, 2 people can eat all the glutinous rice cakes made by Brananda.
"Response:  If Brannda is making cookies for 14 people and each person gets 30 cookies, then the total number of cookies Brannda needs to make is:

14 x 30 = 420 cookies
So Brannda needs to make 420 cookies in total."
Response:  Brannda mum made 50 cookies and divided them equally among 22 people. Therefore, each person received 5 cookies (5 x 22 = 110). However, Brannda mum gave only 17 of those cookies to her children. So, each child got 17/22 = 3.64 cookies.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Brannda's mother made 10 pieces of bread for 10 guests. However, only 9 guests came. So, there are 1 extra piece of bread left over. Now, let's assume that each guest ate an equal number of slices of bread (since they all had the same amount). Therefore, if two guests shared one slice of bread each, they would have eaten a total of 2 slices of bread between them.
Response:  If there are 14 pieces of cake and two guests, then each guest will get 7 pieces of cake (since 14 / 2 = 7). So, each guest will eat 7 pieces of cake.
Response:  If there are 10 pieces of cake and each guest gets two slices, then the total number of slices is 2 x 10 = 20. So, there are 20 guests in total.
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to put them into two bags, then each bag will have how many pieces of candy?  We can start by dividing the total number of candies (42) by the number of bags (2). So, each bag will have 21 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Frank has 26 bags of candy, each bag contains 33 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies that Frank has is: 26 x 33 = 840. So, Frank has 840 candies in total.
Response:  Frank has 33 pieces of candy and loses 24 pieces. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 pieces left. If he puts these remaining pieces in bags with 9 pieces each, then he will have 9 / 9 = 1 bag. Therefore, Frank will have 1 bag.
Response:  If Frank has 22 pieces of candy and he wants to put each piece in a separate bag, then he will have 22 bags.
Response:  If Frank has 16 candies and he wants to put them into two bags, then each bag will have how many candies?  We can divide 16 by 2 to find out that each bag will have 8 candies. So, there are 8 candies in each of the two bags.
Response:  Snow has sold 25 boxes of three-leaf grass. Each box contains 14 pieces of three-leaf grass. Therefore, to calculate how many boxes of three-leaf grass Snow needs to transport, we can divide the total number of pieces of three-leaf grass (25) by the number of pieces in each box (14): Number of boxes = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per box = 25 / 14 = 3 boxes So, Snow needs to transport 3 boxes of three-leaf grass.
Response:  Snow White sold 10 boxes of three-leaf grass. If she wants to sell five boxes, how many individual leaves will there be in each box?  We know that one box contains 3 leaves, so if we want to find out how many leaves are in total, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of leaves in each box. Therefore, the answer is: 5 boxes x 3 leaves/box = 15 leaves.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 67 bottles of regular gasoline and 9 bottles of lightweight gasoline in total. Now, let's calculate how many bottles of sweet wine there are based on the information given in the problem. According to the problem, the number of bottles of sweet wine is more than the number of bottles of lightweight gasoline. Therefore, if x represents the number of bottles of sweet wine, we can write an equation as follows: Number of bottles of sweet wine = x > Number of bottles of lightweight gasoline (9) So far, we have two equations: 67 + x = Total number of bottles (100) and x > 9. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of each equation. For the first equation, we can subtract x from both sides: 67 - x = 100 - x Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: 67 - x = 100 - x > 9 Solving for x, we get: x = 33 So, there are 33 bottles of sweet wine in addition to the 67 bottles of regular gasoline and 9 bottles of lightweight gasoline.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 bottles of regular gasoline water and 61 bottles of lightweight gasoline water in total.  Therefore, the number of bottles of other beverages (including soda) is greater than 22 + 61 = 83.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 bottles of regular gasoline and 8 bottles of lightweight gasoline in total. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular gasoline is 30 / (30 + 8) = 22.5. Since there are 41 fruits in total, we can calculate the number of fruit per bottle as follows: Number of fruits / Total number of bottles = 41 / 22.5 = 1.86. So, there are approximately 19 bottles of regular gasoline and 3 bottles of lightweight gasoline.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 79 bottles of regular gasoline and 53 bottles of lightweight gasoline in total. Therefore, the number of bottles of lightweight gasoline is 53 / 79 = 0.68 or approximately 68%.  Now, let's consider the number of fruit. There are 42 fruits in total. Since there are more than 68% lightweight gasoline bottles, we can conclude that there are at least 42 x 0.68 = 28 fruit. So, there are exactly 28 fruits.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 54 bottles of light beer and 83 bottles of regular beer in total.  Secondly, we are told that there are 12 apples in total. Thirdly, we are asked how many more bottles of soda than beer there are. So, let's convert the number of apples to bottles of soda using the ratio of apples to bottles of soda given in the problem: 1 apple = 0.75 bottle of soda (since there are 12 apples and 91 bottles of soda in total). Therefore, the number of bottles of soda is:  Number of bottles of soda = Number of apples x Conversion factor = 12 x 0.75 = 9 bottles of soda. Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of bottles of soda and beer as follows: Difference = Number of bottles of soda - Number of bottles of beer = 9 - (54 + 83) = -65 bottles of soda. Since the difference is negative, it means that there are fewer bottles of soda than beer. The exact number of bottles of soda less than beer is: Number of bottles of soda less than beer = |Difference| = |-65| = 65 bottles of soda.
Response:  We know that there are 17 bottles in total and 9 of them are regular gasoline water. So, the remaining 8 bottles must be light drinking gasoline water. Now, we have to count how many light drinking gasoline waters each person can eat. There are 29 people in total, so each person can eat at most 29/8 = 4 light drinking gasoline waters. Therefore, the number of light drinking gasoline waters eaten is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 19 bottles of light beer and 60 bottles of regular beer in total. Since we want to find out how many more bottles of soda than beer, let's divide the number of bottles of soda (19) by the number of bottles of beer (60):  $ \frac{19}{60} = \boxed{0.3167} $ So, there are approximately 31.67% more bottles of soda than beer in the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 72 bottles of regular gasoline and 32 bottles of lightweight gasoline in total. Therefore, the total number of bottles is 72 + 32 = 104 bottles. Next, we are told that there are 78 fruits in total. Since each fruit takes up one bottle space, we can deduce that there are 78 / 104 = 0.75 fruits per bottle on average. So, there are approximately 0.75 fruits for every bottle.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 fruits in total. Then, we have 80 bottles of regular gasoline. Now, let's calculate how many bottles of gasoline can fit into one fruit. Since each fruit has a volume of 1 cubic meter (according to the question), then one fruit can hold 80/36 = 2.25 bottles of gasoline. Therefore, there are more than 36 fruits worth of gasoline. So, the answer is greater than 36.
Response:  Since there are 30 bottles in total and 28 of them are regular gasoline water, we have 30 - 28 = 2 remaining bottles that are lightweight gasoline water. Therefore, the number of lightweight gasoline water bottles is 2.
"Response:  If there are four bottles of lightweight drinking water and each bottle contains 79 milliliters of regular drinking water, then we can calculate how many bottles of regular drinking water they have consumed as follows:

Number of bottles of regular drinking water = Number of bottles of lightweight drinking water x Volume of regular drinking water in each bottle
= 4 x 79 milliliters
= 316 milliliters

Therefore, if they drank more than 79 milliliters of regular drinking water for every bottle of lightweight drinking water they consumed, they would have consumed 316 milliliters of regular drinking water."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 57 bottles of regular gasoline and 26 bottles of light gasoline. Therefore, the total number of bottles is 57 + 26 = 83 bottles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 81 bottles of regular gasoline water in total. Then, we have 60 bottles of slimming gasoline water and 60 bottles of lightweight gasoline water. Finally, we need to calculate how many more bottles of sweet wine than lightweight gasoline water. Therefore, the number of extra bottles of sweet wine is: 81 - (60 + 60) = 21 bottles. So, the answer is 21 bottles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 bottles of regular gasoline and 40 bottles of slimming gasoline. Therefore, the total number of bottles is 49 + 40 = 89 bottles. Next, we know that there are 6 bottles of lightweight gasoline. So, the total number of bottles including lightweight gasoline is 89 + 6 = 95 bottles.
"Response:  If there were 317 visitors to the White Gold Palace after finishing lunch, and the previous day had 295 visitors, then we can calculate the increase in visitors as follows:

Increase = New number of visitors - Old number of visitors
= 317 - 295
= 22

Therefore, there were 22 more visitors to the White Gold Palace on that day compared to the previous day."
"Response:  If there were 733 visitors to the Palace of Gold and Jade before Ratchel visited, and if there were 246 visitors per day on average during her visit, then we can calculate the total number of visitors during her visit as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors before Ratchel x Number of days she stayed
= 733 x (25 - 1) / 24
= 733 x 24 / 24
= 733 x 1
= 1799

Therefore, there were approximately 1799 visitors to the Palace of Gold and Jade during Ratchel's visit."
"Response:  If there were 100 customers per day before the visit to the White Palace, and after the visit, there were 666 customers, then we can calculate the increase in customers as follows:

Increase = (666 - 100) / 100 = 566%

So, the number of customers who visited the White Palace that day was 566% more than the previous day."
Response:  If there were 132 visitors to the palace yesterday and it has been 327 days since the last time anyone visited, then the number of people who have come to visit in total is 406 (as given in the question). So, the number of people who came to visit the day before was:  Number of people who came to visit = Total number of visitors - Yesterday's visitors = 406 - 132 = 274  Therefore, 274 people came to visit the palace the day before.
Response:  If there were 45 guests at the palace the day before, and they all came after finishing their meal, then we can assume that each guest took about 1 hour to visit the palace (including travel time). So, in one day, if there are 85 days, then the total number of visitors is:  Number of visitors = Total time taken for each visitor x Total number of days  = 1 hour/day x 85 days  = 85 hours  Now, let's calculate the number of people who visited the palace in 85 days:  Number of people = Total hours / Hour per person  = 85 hours / 1 hour/person  = 85 people/day  Therefore, approximately 85 people visited the palace every day.
"Response:  If there were 557 visitors to the palace yesterday and today there are 188 visitors, then the total number of visitors in the past 57 days would be:

Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors today - Number of visitors yesterday (to find out how many more visitors came today)
= 557 + 188 - 188
= 346

So, in the past 57 days, there have been 346 visitors to the palace."
Response:  If there were 600 visitors to the palace after lunch, and there were 39 paintings in the palace, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per painting as follows:  Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of paintings = 600 / 39 = 15.4 (round up to 16) So, there were approximately 16 visitors for each painting in the palace that day.
Response:  On the first day, there were 419 visitors to the White Gold Palace.  After visiting the palace, they went to the restaurant for lunch.  Therefore, on the second day, there were 92 - 419 = -327 people who visited the palace.  So, the number of people who visited the palace before the second day was -327.
Response:  If there were 471 people who visited the palace yesterday and today there are 808 people, then we can calculate the increase in visitors as follows:  Increase = Today's number - Yesterday's number = 808 - 471 = 337 people. Therefore, there are 337 more people who visited the palace today compared to yesterday.
"Response:  If there were 755 visitors to the White Gold Palace on the day after lunch, and then 457 visitors the next day, we can calculate the increase in visitors as follows:

Day 2 (after lunch): 755 visitors + 191 visitors = 946 visitors

Day 3 (next day): 946 visitors + 457 visitors = 1,403 visitors

Therefore, the number of visitors to the White Gold Palace increased by 458 people from Day 2 to Day 3."
"Response:  If one feather weighs 628 grams, then to find out how many feathers are needed for 159 grams, we can divide 159 by 628. So, we need:

$$ \frac{159}{628} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} $$
Therefore, we need $\boxed{3}$ times as many feathers to make $159$ grams."
Response:  We are given that the total weight of feathers is 288 grams and we need to find out how many grams of paint are needed to cover them all. Since each feather needs 49 grams of paint, we can calculate the number of feathers as follows: Number of feathers = Total weight of feathers / Weight of one feather = 288 g / 49 g = 5.76 feathers Now, since there are only 260 grams of paint available, we cannot cover all the feathers with it. So, the remaining amount of paint left over after covering all the feathers is: Remaining paint = Available paint - Paint required for one feather = 260 g - (5.76 x 49 g) = 13.34 grams Therefore, there are 13.34 grams of paint left over after covering all the feathers.
Response:  We are given that there are 57 grams of paint needed to paint all the feathers together and we need 22 grams more for each feather. Therefore, in total, we need 57 + (22 x number of feathers) = 353 grams of paint. So, there are approximately 306 grams of paint left over after painting all the feathers.
Response:  If he needs 166 grams of feathers and can only provide 20 grams, then he needs 146 grams more (166 - 20 = 146).
Response:  If he has 557 grams of feathers and only needs 17 grams, then we can calculate the number of grams needed per feather as follows:  Number of grams per feather = Total amount of feathers / Amount needed = 557 g / 17 g = 32 feathers So, he needs 32 feathers to have 17 grams of feathers.
Response:  If he has 11 grams of feathers and needs 492 grams, we need to find out how many times 11 grams is equal to 492 grams. To do this, we divide 492 grams by 11 grams: 492 g / 11 g = 44.64 (round up to 45) So, he needs approximately 45 times as much feathers as he currently has.
Response:  We know that there are 94 workers picking grapes on the vineyard and they can harvest 90 dunams of grapes in 6 days. To calculate how many dunams each worker can harvest per day, we need to divide the total amount of grapes harvested (90 dunams) by the number of workers (94). So, each worker can harvest approximately 0.95 dunams of grapes per day ($ \frac{90}{94} $).
"Response:  We know that there are 266 workers picking grapes on the vineyard and they can collect 90 barrels of grapes per day. So, we need to calculate how many barrels each worker can collect in a day. To do this, we divide the total number of barrels collected (90) by the number of workers (266):

Barrels/worker/day = 90 / 266 = 0.34 barrels/worker/day

Now, let's convert this value from barrels to liters. There are approximately 70 liters in one barrel, so:

Liters/worker/day = 0.34 barrels/worker/day x 70 liters/barrel = 23 liters/worker/day

Therefore, each worker can collect approximately 23 liters of grapes per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 294 workers picking grapes on the vineyard every day and each of them can collect 244 buckets of grapes per day. Since there are also 47 buckets of apples collected daily, we need to subtract this amount from the total number of buckets picked by the grape workers. Therefore, the total number of buckets of grapes collected by all workers is:

$$ \text{Total number of buckets of grapes} = \text{Number of grape workers} \times \text{Number of buckets picked per day} - \text{Number of apples collected daily} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of buckets of grapes} &= 294 \times 244 - 47 \\ &= 68,536 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, the vineyard will be full of grapes after $146$ days, which is the time it takes for $68,536 / 294 = 236$ buckets of grapes to be collected daily."
"Response:  We know that there are 235 hands and each hand can hold up to 100 bottles of grapes per day. Therefore, the total number of bottles of grapes that can be filled every day is:

$$ \text {Total number of bottles} = \text{Number of hands} \times \text{Capacity of each hand} $$
= $235$ $\times$ $100$
= $23,500$ bottles/day

Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take to fill all the $77$ barrels. Since there are $221$ barrels in total, we have:

$$ \text{Total number of barrels} = \text{Number of barrels left to fill} + \text{Number of barrels already filled} $$
= $77$ + ($221 - 77)$
= $148$ barrels

Therefore, it will take approximately $148 / 235 = 6.29$ months to fill all the $77$ barrels with grapes at a rate of $23,500$ bottles/day."
Response:  If it takes 57 stations to reach the pear orchard and each station has 252 workers who can fill 108 baskets of pears per day, then we need to calculate how many days it would take for all those workers to fill all the baskets.  Since one pear takes 58 days to grow, if we divide the total number of baskets (252 x 108) by the number of days it takes to grow one pear (58), we get an estimate of how many baskets could be filled in one day:  Number of baskets filled per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days it takes to grow one pear  Number of baskets filled per day = 252 x 108 / 58  Number of baskets filled per day = 436 baskets So, approximately 436 baskets of pears could be filled in one day.
"Response:  If there are 36 workers picking grapes every day and each worker can collect 8 buckets of grapes per day, then we have:

Number of workers = 36
Number of buckets picked per day = 8
Total number of buckets collected in one day = Number of workers x Number of buckets picked per day
= 36 x 8
= 288 buckets
Now, to calculate how many days it will take to fill 240 barrels, we need to divide the total number of buckets collected by the number of barrels:

Days required to fill 240 barrels = Total number of buckets / Number of barrels
= 288 / 240
= 1.2 days (or approximately 1 day and 12 hours)"
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums in total and each aquarium has an equal number of sea creatures. Therefore, the total number of sea creatures is 26 x 52 = 1320. So, there are 1320 sea creatures in all the aquariums combined.
Response:  We know that there are 40 sea creatures in total and each aquarium has 2 sea creatures. So, we can calculate the number of aquariums as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of sea creatures / Number of sea creatures per aquarium = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, there are 20 aquariums in the breeding center.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Tyler has 56 pools for water animals and uses 10 of them for freshwater animals. Each pool contains 39 animals. Therefore, the total number of sea creatures that Tyler has is:  Number of pools = 56 Total number of sea creatures = Number of freshwater animals x Number of pools used for freshwater animals + Number of sea creatures per pool = 10 x 39 + 39 = 480 sea creatures So, Tyler has 480 sea creatures.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums in total and each aquarium has 46 sea animals. Therefore, the total number of sea animals is: 74 x 46 = 3384 sea animals. So, Tyler has 3384 sea animals.
Response:  We know that there are 15 tanks for aquatic animals and 62 tanks for freshwater animals. Each tank has 19 animals in it. So, we can calculate the total number of animals as follows: Total number of animals = Number of tanks x Number of animals per tank Total number of animals = 15 x 19 + 62 x 19 Total number of animals = 307 animals
Response:  If there are 13 pieces of white T-shirts in each package and your mother bought 39 packages, then... (calculate)...she has bought a total of 39 x 13 = 507 white T-shirts!
"Response:  If Mom buys 66 pieces of white T-shirts and each piece has 3 white T-shirts inside, then...

1. Number of white T-shirts = 66 x 3 = 198
2. Total number of packages = 198 / 3 = 66 packages

So, if Mom buys 66 pieces of white T-shirts and each piece has 3 white T-shirts inside, she will have 66 packages in total."
Response:  If there are 28 packages and each package contains 56 white T-shirts, then the total number of white T-shirts is:  Number of packages x Number of items in each package = 28 x 56 = 1492 white T-shirts.
"Response:  If your mom bought 57 white T-shirts and 34 long pants, then she has a total of:

57 + 34 = 91 pieces of clothing."
"Response:  If there are 51 white T-shirts and three can be packed in each package, then we have:

Number of packages = Number of white T-shirts / Number of T-shirts per package
= 51 / 3
= 17 packages
Therefore, there will be 17 packages."
Response:  If your mother bought 70 white T-shirts, and each T-shirt can be packaged in 14 boxes, then... (1) The total number of boxes = Total number of white T-shirts / Number of T-shirts per box = 70 / 14 = 5 boxes. Therefore, there are 5 boxes of white T-shirts that your mother bought.
"Response:  If you have 4 bags of identical cookies that contain 36 cookies in total, then each bag contains:

$$ \frac {Total number of cookies} {Number of bags} = \boxed {36} $$

So, each bag contains:

$$ \boxed {9} $$

cookies."
Response:  If you have 33 bags of cookies and each bag has 11 cookies, then: Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag  Number of bags = 33 x 11 = 353 cookies So, you have 353 cookies in total.
Response:  If each bag has 41 chocolates and you have 53 chocolates in total, then you must have more than one bag of chocolates. So, let's assume that you have x bags of chocolates. Since each bag contains 41 chocolates, the total number of chocolates in all bags is x \* 41. Therefore, the difference between the total number of chocolates (53) and the number of chocolates in each bag (41) is equal to the number of bags you have: 53 - 41 = x. Thus, you have x/41 bags of chocolates.
Response:  If you have 14 pieces of bread and each bag can hold the same number of bread, then the total number of bread in all bags is equal to 14 x NumberOfBags = 14 x 7 = 98. Therefore, there are 98 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  If each bag has 3 cookies and you have 21 cookies in total, then: Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag = 21 / 3 = 7 bags. Therefore, there are 7 bags of cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 26 bags of cookies and we have 15 pieces of sugar and 52 crackers. To find out how many bags of crackers we have, we need to divide the number of crackers by the number of bags of cookies. So, if we divide 52 by 26, we get 2. Therefore, we have 2 bags of crackers for every bag of cookies. In total, we have 2 x 26 = 52 bags of crackers.
Response:  If you have 28 pieces of candy and 86 pieces of candy, that means you have a total of 114 pieces of candy (28 + 86 = 114).  Since each bag contains an equal number of cookies, if you have 114 pieces of candy, then you must have 114/14 = 8 bags of cookies. Therefore, you have 8 bags of cookies.
Response:  If there are five pieces of trash mail and each piece is sent to every house in a street, then the number of houses in that street will be equal to the total number of pieces of trash mail divided by five. So, if there are 25 pieces of trash mail in total, then there will be 5 houses in each street.
Response:  If there are 9 pieces of trash mail and each house has 20 rooms, then we need to send 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of trash mail in total.
Response:  If there are six houses in one street and the mailman needs to send 24 pieces of trash mail to each street, then he will need to send 144 pieces of trash mail (6 x 24 = 144) to all the streets combined. So, the mailman will send 144 pieces of trash mail to every house.
Response:  If there are 14 trash letters and each letter is sent to every house in a street, then the total number of houses in that street is 14/2 = 7 streets.  Now, if the postman wants to send two trash letters to each street, then the total number of trash letters sent will be 2 x 7 = 14 trash letters. Therefore, there are 14 trash letters in total.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each street and the mailman needs to send 32 pieces of trash mail to every house, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of houses in all streets.
Total number of houses = Number of streets x Number of houses per street
= 20 x 20
= 400 houses

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of trash mail that need to be sent.
Total number of pieces of trash mail = Total number of houses x Number of pieces of trash mail per house
= 400 houses x 32 pieces
= 12800 pieces of trash mail

Therefore, the mailman will have to send 12800 pieces of trash mail to deliver them to all 20 houses in each of the 20 streets."
Response:  Firstly, we need to divide the total number of trash emails (30) by the number of streets (78). This gives us an average number of trash emails per street, which is 0.39 (30 / 78). Now, let's assume that each house has one mailbox, and therefore, each street will have one or more mailboxes. So, the number of trash emails sent to each street can be calculated as follows: Number of trash emails sent to each street = Average number of trash emails per street x Number of mailboxes in each street. Therefore, the answer is 0.39 x 19 = 6.71 trash emails per house.
"Response:  If there are 8 pieces of trash mail and each piece is sent to 55 streets, then the total number of streets that receive at least one piece of trash mail is:

$$ \text {Total number of streets} = \frac{\text{Number of pieces of trash mail}}{\text{Number of streets}} $$

Given that there are 8 pieces of trash mail, we can calculate the total number of streets as follows:

$$ \text {Total number of streets} = \frac{8}{55} = 0.147 \text{ streets} $$

So, approximately 14.7% of the streets will receive at least one piece of trash mail."
Response:  If there are four pieces of junk mail and each piece needs to be sent to every one of the 81 buildings (which is equal to 81 x 12 = 972 houses), then we need to send out 4 x 972 = 3888 pieces of junk mail in total. So, the person needs to forward each piece of junk mail to approximately 40 people (3888 / 972).
Response:  Since there are four pieces of trash mail and 16 street districts, each district will receive one piece of trash mail. Therefore, the total number of trash mails sent is 4 x 16 = 64.
"Response:  We have ten eggs and twenty marbles. If we want to divide them into four groups of equal size, we can do so as follows: Group 1: 3 eggs, 5 marbles; Group 2: 2 eggs, 4 marbles; Group 3: 2 eggs, 4 marbles; Group 4: 3 eggs, 5 marbles. Therefore, there are 4 possible ways to group the eggs and marbles."
Response:  We have ten eggs and fifteen marbles. If we want to divide them into five groups of eggs and five groups of marbles, respectively, there are several ways to do this. Here is one possible way: Group 1 (5 eggs): Eggs 1-5 Group 2 (4 eggs): Eggs 6-9 Group 3 (3 eggs): Eggs 10-12 Group 4 (2 eggs): Eggs 13-14 Group 5 (1 egg): Egg 15 Marbles: Group 1 (7 marbles): Marbles 1-7 Group 2 (4 marbles): Marbles 8-11 Group 3 (3 marbles): Marbles 12-14 Group 4 (2 marbles): Marbles 15 Groups can be formed in different ways depending on how you distribute the eggs and marbles. However, based on the information provided, it seems that at least five groups of eggs and five groups of marbles can be formed.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to collect 11 groups of eggs and each group has 2 eggs, then she will need a total of 2 x 11 = 22 eggs. So, Lebbeca will have 22 eggs.
Response:  We have eight eggs and six pebbles. If we want to divide them into four groups of equal size, we need to find out how many eggs or pebbles each group should contain.  Since there are eight eggs, each group can have up to 8/4 = 2 eggs. Similarly, since there are six pebbles, each group can have up to 6/4 = 1 pebble. Therefore, each group will contain 2 eggs and 1 pebble. So, there will be a total of 8 + 6 = 14 objects in each group.
Response:  Since there are four rubber ducks and each group needs to have at least three eggs, we can start with that assumption. Then, since there are fifteen eggs in total, we need to divide them among the groups in such a way that each group has at least three eggs. So, the number of eggs each group will have is: 4 (rubber ducks) x 3 (minimum number of eggs per group) = 12 eggs. Therefore, each group will have 12 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, we have 18 eggs (Rebecca). Then, we have 72 marbles and 66 pearls. We can group them as follows:  Eggs - 18 Marbles - 72 Pearls - 66 Total groups = 6 Therefore, there are 6 possible ways to collect these objects into small groups of equal size.
Response:  We have 99 eggs and 9 egg cartons with 3 eggs each. So we have 9 x 3 = 27 eggs in total. Now, we have 27 gems and 1 gem can be divided into 3 groups of 9 gems each. Therefore, the number of small groups that can be formed is 3^3 = 27.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and wants to divide them into 5 groups. Since each egg can hold 6 pebbles, we need to calculate how many pebbles are needed for all the eggs together. So, the total number of pebbles required is:  Number of pebbles = Total number of eggs x Number of pebbles per egg = 20 eggs x 6 pebbles/egg = 120 pebbles Now, since there are more than one pebble in each group (5 groups), we need to divide the total number of pebbles by the number of pebbles in each group. Therefore, the number of pebbles in each group is: Number of pebbles in each group = Total number of pebbles / Number of groups = 120 pebbles / 5 groups = 24 pebbles So, Rebecca has 24 pebbles more than one grain of rice.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has five marbles and wants to divide them into 20 groups of equal size. Since each group requires one marble, we can conclude that she will have 5 / 20 = 1/4 of a marble left over after dividing the marbles equally among all groups. Therefore, there are 4 + 1 = 5 marbles in total.
Response:  If Luke got 154 points in total and he scored 11 points per round, then we can calculate the number of rounds as follows: Number of rounds = Total score / Score per round Total score = 154 Points Score per round = 11 Points Therefore, Luke played for __________ rounds. (Insert your answer here)
"Response:  If Luke gets 46 points every time he plays trivia games and there are 177 rounds in total, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of points Luke earns throughout all 177 rounds.
Total points = Number of points earned per round x Total number of rounds
= 46 x 177
= 8,202 points

Therefore, if Luke earns 46 points every time he plays trivia games and there are 177 rounds in total, he will have earned approximately 8,202 points throughout the competition."
Response:  If Luke gets 84 points in total and each round is worth an equal number of points, then we can calculate the number of points he got in each round as follows: Points per round = Total points / Number of rounds = 84 / Number of rounds Since there are 20 rounds in total, Luke got 84/20 = 4.2 points in each round.
Response:  If Luke gets 146 points in each round of the trivia game, and he plays 157 rounds, then his total score would be:  Total score = Number of rounds x Points per round = 157 x 146 = 23,092 points.
Response:  If Luke gets 3 points every round and he scored 78 points in total, then he must have played __________ rounds.
Response:  If Emily has two marbles and wants to share them equally among her three friends, each friend will get one marble. So far so good! Now, if we want to find out how many marbles each friend needs to have in total, we can use multiplication. We know that there are 32 items in total (3 friends x 10 marbles per friend = 32). Therefore, each friend needs 32 / 3 = 10 marbles in total.
Response:  If Emily has 11 friends and each friend needs 28 beads, then...
Response:  Since each friend has 8 beads and Emily has 16 beads in total, we can create at least 2 chains of beads (one from each friend). So, the minimum number of chain possibilities is 2.
Response:  If Emily has 18 friends and each friend needs at least 6 pearls, then we need to calculate how many pearls are needed in total. So, the answer is:  Total number of pearls needed = Number of friends x Minimum number of pearls required per friend = 18 x 6 = 108 pearls.
Response:  If Emily has four friends and each friend needs five pearls, then how many pearls does Emily need to give away in total?  Total number of pearls needed = Number of friends x Number of pearls required per friend  Total number of pearls needed = 4 x 5  Total number of pearls needed = 20 pearls So, Emily has 20 pearls.
"Response:  Since there are 72 friends and each friend has three pearls in total (6 pearls + 3 pearls), we have a total of:

72 x 3 = 216 pearls

Now, since Emily can make multiple chain links with each pearl, she can make:

216 / 3 = 72 chains

So, Emily can make 72 chains with these 216 pearls."
"Response:  Emily has 43 friends and she wants to give each of them a jewelry set with 20 items in total. Since each item requires at least one gemstone, we need to determine how many gems are needed for all the items combined.

Let G be the number of gems required for all the items.

From the problem statement, we know that there are 5 types of jewelry sets (e.g., earrings, necklaces, etc.). So, the total number of gems required is equal to the sum of the number of gems required for each type of set:
G = 5 x Number of gems required per set

Now, let's find out how many gems are required per set:
Number of gems required per set = Total number of gems / Number of jewelry sets
= 20 / 43
= 0.46 (approximately)

So, Emily needs approximately 46 gems to make jewelry sets for her 43 friends."
Response:  Emily has made 44 jewelry pieces for her friends, and each piece contains 26 stones. Therefore, the total number of stones used by Emily is:  44 x 26 = 1152 stones. So, Emily has 1152 stones in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8195 people who went to camp during summer vacation in Los Angeles County.  Then, we have 66827 people who stayed at home and worked during summer vacation.  Comparing these two numbers, we can see that the number of people who went to camp is significantly higher than those who stayed at home and worked.  In fact, about twice as many people went to camp compared to those who stayed at home and worked.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 202,958 people who went to camp during summer vacation in Los Angeles County. Now, let's calculate the proportion of people who stayed at home among these 202,958 people. We can do this by dividing the number of people who stayed at home (777,622) by the total number of people who went to camp (202,958). So, the proportion of people who stayed at home is 384.1% (777,622 / 202,958 = 384.1%). Therefore, approximately 384.1% more people stayed at home than went to camp during summer vacation in Los Angeles County.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8,98,051 students in total. Now, let's calculate the number of students who went to camping trips during summer vacation. We have been given that 629,424 students went for camping trips. So, the ratio of students who went for camping trips to those who stayed at home is 629,424/8,98,051 = 7%. Therefore, approximately 7% of the students stayed at home during summer vacation.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 313473 small roads in Lolang County. Secondly, we know that during summer vacation, 2748 people (60% of the total) stayed at home. Finally, we want to know how many small roads were not used for camping during the summer vacation period. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Number of small roads not used for camping = Total number of small roads - Number of people staying at home x Number of small roads per person To find out the exact number of small roads not used for camping, we need to know the average number of small roads per person who went camping. However, this information is not provided in the question. So, we will make an assumption and assume that each person goes camping on one small road. With these assumptions, we can calculate the number of small roads not used for camping as follows: Number of small roads not used for camping = 313473 - (2748 x 1) = 313473 - 2748 = 285925 small roads Not used for camping During the summer vacation period in Lolang County, approximately 285925 small roads were not used for camping.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 90,761 houses in Lornes County during summer vacation. Then, we have to subtract the number of small friends who go camping outside the county, which is 45,568. Therefore, the total number of small friends in Lornes County is: 90,761 - 45,568 = 45,193.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 8,593 students went to camp during summer vacation in Los Angeles County.  Therefore, the percentage of students who went to camp is: (8,593/828,521) x 100% = 10.4%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6161 students in Los Angeles County who have stayed overnight at their grandparents', which is equal to $6161 x 2 = $12322. Next, we need to subtract the number of students who have not stayed overnight at their grandparents': $12322 - $91676 =-$74450. Therefore, there are approximately $74450 more paths for the students from Los Angeles County to go camping than those who have stayed overnight at their grandparents'.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3,4044 students from Lorain County who went to camp and 134,867 students from other counties who stayed in their hometowns. Therefore, the total number of students who did not go to camp is: 134,867 - 3,4044 = 131,423.  Next, we know that there are 4,249,444 students from outside the county who participated in the camp. So, the total number of students who attended the camp is: 4,249,444 + 131,423 = 4,380,867.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6176 students who will go to camping during summer vacation. Then, we have 5976 students who will stay in dormitories. Finally, we have 22 students from outside counties participating in the camp. Therefore, the total number of little friends in Larones County is: 6176 + 5976 + 22 = 12374.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6,449,997 students in Los Angeles County who stayed at home during summer vacation. Then, we have to subtract the number of students from other counties who participated in the camp, which is 8,93,835. Finally, we add the number of out-of-county students who joined the camp, which is 78. Therefore, the total number of campsites in Los Angeles County is:  6,449,997 - (8,93,835 + 78) = 5,301,264 campsites.
Response:  If Adam has 9 fruits and he gave 3 to Jackie, then Adam had 9 - 3 = 6 fruits left. So, Jackie has 6 / 2 = 3 fruits.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jake has 2 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Jake has from the total number of apples that Adam has, we get:  $10 - 2 = 8$  Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jake.
Response:  Adam has nine fruits and Jake has ten fruits. To find out how many more fruits Jake has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of fruits Adam has from the number of fruits Jake has. So, the answer is: Jake has 10 - 9 = 1 more fruit than Adam.
Response: 傑基 (Jerry) has 10 fruits and Adam has 8 fruits. To find out how many more fruits Jerry has than Adam, we can subtract the number of fruits Adam has from the number of fruits Jerry has: 10 - 8 = 2. So, Jerry has 2 more fruits than Adam.
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 6 fruits together, then they must have had 3 each.  Now, if Adam has 3 apples and Jackie has 3 bananas, there are 3 + 3 = 6 fruits in total. So, the difference between the number of fruits that Adam has and the number of fruits that Jackie has is 4 (fruits). Therefore, the number of fruits that Adam has is 3 - 4 = 1 fruit less than Jackie.
Response:  Adam and Jackie have 7 fruits in total. If we add 9 more fruits to their collection, then they will have a total of 16 fruits (7 + 9 = 16). Therefore, there are 9 additional fruits beyond what Adam and Jackie initially had.
Response:  Adam and Jackie have 12 fruits in total. If Adam has 9 more fruits than Jackie, then Jackie has 3 fruits (since 9 - 3 = 6). So, Adam has 12 + 6 = 18 fruits. Now, we need to find out how many fruits Adam has more than Jackie. Since Adam has 18 fruits and Jackie has 3 fruits, Adam is ahead by 15 fruits (18 - 3 = 15). Therefore, there are 15 more fruits with Adam than Jackie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has 10 fruits and he shared two with Adam. So, Adam has 2 + 10 = 12 fruits in total. Now, let's calculate how many fruits Jaden has after adding his four fruits to Adam's fruits. Therefore, Jaden has 12 (Adam's fruits) + 4 = 16 fruits in total. Finally, we can see that Aden has six more fruits than Jaden, so Aden has 16 + 6 = 22 fruits in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has 89 fruits and he shares them equally among 11 people. So each person gets 8 fruits from Jake. Now we need to find out how many fruits Aden has. According to the problem, Aden has 5 more fruits than Jake. Therefore, Aden has 8 + 5 = 13 fruits.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 31 cookies. Today, she baked 270 more cookies in the morning. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Helen has baked is: 31 + 270 = 301 cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies. Today, she baked 51 more pears and 484 more chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen used 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Helen made 527 chocolate cookies and 86 strawberry cookies yesterday. Today, she produced 86 strawberry pastries and 554 chocolate pastries. To find out how many chocolate cookie crumbs Helen used, we can divide the number of chocolate pastries she produced today (554) by the number of chocolate cookies she made yesterday (527): 554 / 527 = 1.03 Therefore, Helen used approximately 1.03 times more chocolate cookie crumbs than she did yesterda...
Response:  Helen made 144 chocolate cookies and 397 strawberry cookies yesterday. Today, she baked 85 strawberry cookies and 403 chocolate cookies. To calculate how many pieces of each fruit tree she used to make these cookies, we can use the following formula: Number of pieces = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per piece So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this formula, we get: Number of pieces = 85 + 403 = 488 Number of cookies per piece = 144 + 397 = 541 Now, let's divide the total number of pieces (488) by the number of cookies per piece (541): Number of pieces of fruit tree used = 488 / 541 = 9.26 Therefore, Helen used approximately 9.26 pieces of each fruit tree (strawberry or chocolate) to make all the cookies she baked today.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies. Today, she baked 231 grapes and 237 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 258 times (19 + 231 + 237).
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and 46 strawberry cookies. Today, she cooked 75 strawberry cookies and 66 chocolate cookies. To find out how many more chocolate cookies Helen baked today than yesterday, we can subtract the number of chocolate cookies she baked yesterday from the number of chocolate cookies she baked today: 75 - 197 = -122 Therefore, Helen baked 122 fewer chocolate cookies today than yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate cookies and 300 strawberry cookies. Today, she produced 280 child-size cookies and 359 chocolate cookies. To find out how many more strawberry cookies Helen baked yesterday than today, we can subtract the number of strawberry cookies she made today from the number she made yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. So, Helen baked 20 more strawberry cookies yesterday than today.
Response:  Katie has 81 DS games and her friend has 59 DS games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friend, we can subtract their number of games: 81 - 59 = 22. So, Katie has 22 more DS games than her friend.
Response:  Katie has 91 games, her new friend has 88 games, and her old friend has 53 games. So, the total number of games among all three friends is: 91 + 88 + 53 = 232 games. Therefore, the number of games that Katie's new friend has is 232 - 91 = 141 games.
Response:  Katie has 78 new games and 86 old games, for a total of 164 games.  Her friend has 48 new games, so together they have 212 games (164 + 48).
Response:  Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, for a total of 103 games. Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, for a total of 77 games. So, together they can play 103 + 77 = 180 games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie has 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 142 games.  Then, we know that her friend has 73 new games and 41 old games, so he/she has a total of 114 games.  Therefore, there are 28 more old games than new games among Katie's friends (i.e., 80 - 41 = 39).
Response:  Katie has 57 games and her friend has 63 games for Nintendo DS. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friend, we need to subtract the number of games her friend has from the number of games Katie has. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  57 - 63 = -6  Therefore, Katie has 6 fewer games than her friend.
Response:  Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Her friend has 34 new games, so he has a total of 34 games.  Therefore, Katie has more games than her friend by 62 games (96 - 34 = 62).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and Jason had $19. Then, Jason spent $33 to wash his car over the weekend, so he now has $19 + $33 = $52. Therefore, Jason earned $52 - $19 = $33 more than Fred.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 last week and spent $9 on laundry this week, leaving him with $77. Then, we know that Jason had $5 last week and didn't work over the weekend, so he still has $5. Therefore, the total amount of money they have together is: $77 + $5 = $82.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $40 and Jason earned $69 during the weekend. So their total earnings are:
Fred: $40 + $69 = $109
Jason: $69 + $40 = $109
Since both of them earned the same amount, neither one gained more money than the other. Therefore, the answer is:
Fred did not gain any money this weekend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and Jason had $22. So, if they both cleaned cars over the weekend and earned money from it, their earnings can be calculated as follows: Fred earned $21 (since he cleaned 21 cars) and Jason earned $78 (since he cleaned 78 cars). Therefore, Jason earned more money than Fred during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 last week and spent $15 to wash his car. So he has $96 left ($111 - $15 = $96).  Next, we know that Jason earned $40 and spent $20 on something else. Therefore, he has $20 left ($40 - $20 = $20). Now, let's compare how much money each person has left after their respective expenses. We can see that Fred has more money left than Jason, so Fred made more money from washing his car. The difference in amount is $76 ($96 - $20 = $76).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 last week and spent $112 on washing his car. So, he now has $63 left ($49 + $112 - $112). Secondly, we know that Jason had $3 last week and earned $112 delivering newspapers. Therefore, he now has $105 ($3 + $112). Finally, to find out how much money they both made from delivering newspapers, we simply subtract the amount of money they had before from the amount they have now: $105 (Jason) - $63 (Fred) = $42. So, they both made $42 from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $78 last week and Jason had $31. Then, we are told that they both earned $14 each delivering newspapers. Therefore, their total earnings from delivering newspapers is: $78 + $31 = $109. Now, let's see how much money Fred made during the weekend when he washed cars. He made $90, which means his total earnings for the week are: $109 + $90 = $199. So, Jason earned more than Fred in delivering newspapers.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $33 and Jason had $95.  If Fred earned $16 more after delivering newspapers, his new amount is: $33 + $16 = $50. So, Fred earned $50 this weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and earned an additional $111 this week through delivering newspapers. Therefore, his current amount of money is: $47 + $111 = $158. Now, let's consider Jason's situation. We are told that he had $99 last week and did not earn any extra money over the weekend. So, his current amount of money remains unchanged at $99. Comparing both amounts, we can see that Fred gained $61 more than Jason ($158 - $99 = $59).
Response:  After running every day for 3 months, his body weight decreased from 71 kg to 51 kg, which is a total of 20 kg. So, his current body weight is 51 kg - 20 kg = 31 kg less than his original body weight.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg (59.4 lbs). After running for 3 months, he lost 101 kg (222.8 lbs), which means he lost an average of 33.67 grams per day during this period. Therefore, the weight loss can be calculated as follows: Weight loss = Total weight loss / Time taken = 101 kg / 3 months = 33.67 g/day x 3 months = 100.01 kg (or 220.02 lbs) So, after 3 months of running every day, Jessie lost approximately 100.01 kg (or 220.02 lbs) in total.
Response:  Before starting his daily slow run, Jessie weighed 126 kg. After he started running every day, he lost 30 kg, which means he now weighs 96 kg. So, the weight difference between before and after is 30 kg - 126 kg = -96 kg.
Response:  Before starting his daily slow run, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After he started running every day, he lost 35 kg. So, after running for some time, Jessie's weight was: 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg.
Response:  After Jesse started running every day, he lost weight in the following amounts per week: Week 1: -50 kg Week 2: -60 kg From this information, we can calculate how much weight Jesse lost overall: Total weight loss = Weekly weight loss x Number of weeks = (-50 kg/week) x (1 week + 1 week) = -100 kg So, Jesse lost 100 kg in total.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 9 kg (which is equivalent to 19.8 lbs). After one week of running, he lost 62 kg (or 136.6 lbs), and after two weeks, he lost an additional 140 kg (or 307.5 lbs). So, in total, Jessie lost 202 kg (or 444.6 lbs) before starting his daily runs.
Response:  After Jesse started running every day for 92 kg, he lost weight in the first week as follows: Day 1: -56 kg, Day 2: -99 kg. So, Jesse lost a total of 155 kg (56 + 99) during the first two weeks of running every day.
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in total and 61 of them are hiding inside their enclosures. If there are 64 snakes hidden, then we can deduce that the remaining 5 snakes (95 - 64 = 31) are not hidden. Therefore, there are 31 snakes that are not hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes in a cage and 97 snakes outside of it. If 40 of them are hiding, then we have to subtract 40 from both numbers. So, inside the cage, there will be 53 snakes left (93 - 40 = 53), and outside the cage, there will be 57 snakes left (97 - 40 = 57). Therefore, the number of snakes hidden is 53 + 57 = 110.
Response:  We have three snakes in one enclosure and 75 hiding places for them to choose from. If there are 82 snakes in total and 19 of them are hiding, then we can calculate the number of snakes that are not hiding as follows: Number of non-hiding snakes = Total number of snakes - Number of hiding snakes Non-hiding snakes = 82 - 19 = 63 So, there are 63 snakes that are not hiding.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the enclosure, and 24 of them are snakes. So, the number of non-snake animals is 79 - 24 = 55. Now, we are told that 51 of these non-snake animals are hiding inside the bushes. Therefore, the number of non-snake animals outside the bushes is 55 - 51 = 4.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer harvested 134 tomatoes from his garden. Today, he harvested 30 more tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes he has now is: 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes. Therefore, there are 164 - 134 = 30 tomatoes left in the garden after today's harvest.
Response:  If he planted 160 tomatoes yesterday and picked 56 of them today, then there are 160 - 56 = 104 tomato plants left in the garden.  And if he picked 41 more tomatoes today, then there are 104 - 41 = 63 tomato plants left in the garden now. So, the number of trees he picked yesterday is 63 / 2 (since each tree has two branches) = 31.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer picked 154 tomatoes from his garden. Today, he picked another 50 tomatoes. So, in total, the farmer has picked 154 + 50 = 204 tomatoes from his garden.
"Response:  If he has 175 tomatoes and 77 beans, and he gives away 172 beans, then he has:

Tomatoes left = 175 - 172 = 3
Beans left = 77 - 172 = -98
So, he has 3 tomatoes and -98 beans left."
Response:  The farmer has planted 177 tomatoes and 12 peppers in his garden. If he harvests 53 tomatoes, then he will have left behind how many tomatoes and peppers? To find out, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes he harvested from the total number of tomatoes he had planted:  Number of tomatoes remaining = Total number of tomatoes - Number of tomatoes harvested = 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes Now, let's check how many peppers are left. We know that the farmer harvested 53 tomatoes, but he did not mention anything about peppers. Therefore, all 12 peppers are still in the garden. So, the final answer is: Number of tomatoes remaining = 124 Tomatoes Number of peppers remaining = 12 Peppers
Response:  The farmer has planted 105 green peppers and 71 red peppers. If he harvests 137 red peppers, then we need to find out how many red peppers are left after harvesting 137 peppers from the total number of red peppers planted. So, the number of red peppers left = Total number of red peppers - Number of red peppers harvested = 71 - 137 = -66 red peppers. Therefore, there are -66 red peppers left in the garden after harvesting 137 red peppers.
"Response:  If Joann needs to use four nails to fix each wooden board, and each wooden board requires two nails, then she will need... See full solution

Answer:  Let's think step by step.

If Joann needs to use four nails to fix each wooden board, and each wooden board requires two nails, then she will need a total of:

4 nails/board x number of boards = total number of nails needed

We are given that there are 10 wooden boards in total, so we can calculate the total number of nails needed as follows:

Total number of nails needed = 4 nails/board x 10 boards = 40 nails

Therefore, Joann will need 40 nails to fix all 10 wooden boards."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John needs to use 13 pieces of large wooden planks to construct the wall. Each piece of wood requires 17 nails for fixing. Therefore, the total number of nails needed is:

13 x 17 = 201 nails

Now, let's consider the small wooden planks. We are told that John needs 8 nails for each of these planks. So, the total number of nails needed for all the small planks is:

8 x 4 = 32 nails

Therefore, in total, John needs 201 + 32 = 233 nails to fix both types of wooden planks onto the wall."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, John used 11 nails to attach 4 large wooden planks to the wall. If each wooden plank requires 3 nails for attachment, then how many nails were left unused?
Therefore, John needed 4 x 3 = 12 wood planks to complete the task."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 pieces of wood planks in total (12 big ones and 12 small ones). If each big wooden plank needs 15 nails to fix it onto the wall, then the number of nails needed for all big wooden planks is: 12 x 15 = 180 nails. Similarly, if each small wooden plank needs 5 nails to fix it onto the wall, then the number of nails needed for all small wooden planks is: 12 x 5 = 60 nails. Therefore, John needs a total of 180 + 60 = 240 nails to fix all the wooden planks onto the wall.
Response:  Since each wooden board needs two nails to fix it onto the wall, and John used 16 boards in total, he will need 8 nails (2 x 16 = 32). Therefore, the answer is 8.
"Response:  If each wooden board needs 74 nails to be fixed, and there are 8 boards in total, then we need:

Number of nails required = 8 boards x 74 nails per board = 592 nails

So, Joann needs 592 wooden boards to build the wall."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are ten large wooden boards and seventeen small wooden boards in total.  Each large wooden board requires fourteen nails to fix it onto the wall, so the number of nails needed for all large wooden boards is:

$$ \text{Number of nails for large wooden boards} = 10 \times 14 = 140 $$

Similarly, each small wooden board requires twenty-five nails to fix it onto the wall, so the number of nails needed for all small wooden boards is:

$$ \text{Number of nails for small wooden boards} = 17 \times 25 = 425 $$

Now, let's calculate the total number of nails needed for both types of wooden boards:

$$ \text{Total number of nails} = \text{Number of nails for large wooden boards} + \text{Number of nails for small wooden boards} $$

Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:

$$ \text{Total number of nails} = 140 + 425 = 565 $$

Therefore, John needs $565$ wooden planks to build the wall."
Response:  Since each box has 3 pieces of candy and there are 42 boxes in total, we can calculate the number of candies as follows: Number of candies = Total number of boxes x Number of pieces per box So, the number of candies is: Number of candies = 42 x 3 = 126 candies Therefore, Robin has 126 packages of candy.
"Response:  Since there are 43 boxes of mouthwash and each box contains 23 small pieces, we have a total of:

43 x 23 = 1009 pieces of mouthwash in total. Therefore, Robin has 8 pieces of mouthwash."
Response:  Since each box has 7 pieces of candy, and Robin has 6 extra pieces, there are in total 7 + 6 = 13 pieces of candy. Now, we know that Red has 41 boxes, so he must have 41 x 13 = 523 pieces of candy. Therefore, Robin has 523 - 6 = 517 packages of candy.
Response:  Since there are 28 bags of roasted nuts and each bag has 4 pieces, we have a total of 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of roasted nuts. Now, let's consider the sugar candies. There are 13 bags of sugar candies, and each bag contains 4 pieces as well. Therefore, we have a total of 13 x 4 = 52 pieces of sugar candies. So, Robin has 112 + 52 = 164 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin has 21 boxes of candies and each box contains 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies that Robin has is:  21 x 9 = 189 candies.  Now, let's consider the number of boxes of chocolates that Robin has. The question states that Robin has 45 boxes of chocolates. Since each box contains 9 pieces of chocolate, the total number of chocolates that Robin has is:  45 x 9 = 375 chocolates. So, in summary, Robin has 189 candies and 375 chocolates.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 bags of robin fruit and each bag contains 6 pieces of robin. Therefore, the total number of pieces of robin is: 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of robin. Now, let's move to the sugar candies. We know that there are 14 bags of sugar candies and each bag contains 6 pieces of sugar candy. Therefore, the total number of pieces of sugar candies is: 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of sugar candies. So, in summary, there are 168 pieces of robin and 84 pieces of sugar candies.
Response:  If one machine can produce three shirts in one minute and there are six shirts in total to be produced, then we need to calculate how many minutes it takes for the machine to produce all six shirts.  We know that the machine produces three shirts per minute, so it will take 6/3 = 2 minutes for the machine to produce all six shirts. Therefore, the machine operates for 2 minutes.
Response:  If it takes only five minutes for the machine to operate and it can produce four shirts in one minute, then we can calculate the number of shirts produced per hour as follows: Number of shirts = Total time taken for operation / Time taken for each shirt Production rate (shirts/minute) x Total time taken for operation = 5 minutes / 1 minute = 5 shirts/minute Now, let's convert this value to an hourly production rate: Number of shirts/hour = Production rate (shirts/minute) x Number of minutes in an hour Production rate (shirts/minute) x 60 minutes/hour = 5 shirts/minute x 60 minutes/hour = 300 shirts/hour Therefore, the machine can produce 300 shirts per hour.
Response:  If the machine can make 9 shirts yesterday and today it made 44 shirts, that means it has increased its production capacity by 5 times! So, if it took 1 minute to make 3 shirts yesterday, then today it will take (44/9) x 1 = 2 minutes to make 3 shirts. Therefore, the machine works for 2 minutes during the daytime.
Response:  If one machine can make 13 shirts in an hour and it makes another 3 shirts today, then the total number of shirts made by this machine is 16 (13 + 3). Now, if this machine can produce 8 shirts per minute, then it has produced a total of 8 x 60 = 480 shirts in an hour. Therefore, the machine operates for approximately 480 / 60 = 8 minutes to produce 480 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can make 9 shirts per day and today it made 8 shirts, then we know that its production rate is reduced by 1 shirt per day compared to yesterday.  Therefore, if the machine can produce 2 shirts in one minute, then it has produced a total of 14 shirts (9 x 2 = 14) during the time it took to complete 8 shirts today. So, the number of minutes it took to complete 8 shirts today is: 14 / 2 = 7 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine could make 3 shirts in one minute, so it worked for 3 minutes to produce 4 shirts. Today, the machine can make 3 shirts in 1 minute again, but it worked for 2 times longer than yesterday, which is 6 minutes (since 8 - 4 = 6). Therefore, the machine operated for 6 + 3 = 9 minutes in total.
Response:  If one industrial machine can produce six shirts in one minute and its effectiveness is 12 minutes per shirt, then it means that in one hour, it can produce 6 x 12 = 72 shirts.  Today, it produced 14 shirts, which means that it produced 14 / 72 = 0.19 (or 19%) of its full capacity. Therefore, the machine can produce approximately 72 - 0.19 = 63.11 (or 63%) more shirts than its current output.
Response:  If one industrial machine can make six shirts in one minute and takes five minutes to make ten shirts, then it means that this machine can produce 60 shirts per hour (12 x 5 = 60). Therefore, if today there are 12 shirts for the machine to make, it will take 12/60 = 0.2 hours or 12 minutes for the machine to complete them all.
Response:  If the game's daily income is $165 and it lasts for five days, then we can calculate the total amount of money earned as follows: Total Daily Income = $165 x 5 = $825 So, each day, the player earns $825.
Response:  If the daily income is $144 and there are 22 days in the festival, then the total amount earned during the festival is: Total Amount = Daily Income x Number of Days = $144 x 22 = $3,088
"Response:  The game earns $420 in 30 days, and there are 22 pennies per dollar. Therefore, the number of pennies earned in 30 days is:
$420 x 22 = 9,160 pennies
So, you can earn approximately 9,160 pennies every day."
Response:  The first 44 days of the game earned $382, and the remaining 10 days earned $374. Therefore, in total, they earned $382 + $374 = $756.
Response:  The person won $120 in the first 20 days of the game and earned $66 in the remaining 16 days. Therefore, the total amount earned is: $120 + $66 = $186. So, per day, the person earned approximately $11.33 ($186 / 16 days).
Response:  On day 154, he earned $325 and on day 57, he earned $140. So, in total, he earned $465 ($325 + $140) during those 57 days.
Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought ten bags of cookies and four boxes of cake. So, in total, she bought 10 + 4 = 14 packages of sweets.
Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought 4 packages of crackers and 22 packages of cookies. Therefore, she bought a total of 26 packages (4 + 22 = 26) of snacks from the store.
"Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought 23 bags of cookies and 5 bags of cake. So far, we have:

Cookies: 23 bags x $10/bag = $230
Cake: 5 bags x $8/bag = $40
Total cost: $230 + $40 = $270
Therefore, Lucy bought 27 bags (23 + 5) of random items."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy bought 2 bags of crackers and 12 boxes of cakes. So, in total, she bought $10 \times 2 = 20$ bags of crackers and $12 \times 12 = 144$ boxes of cakes. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by Lucy is $20 + 144 = 164$ dollars. Finally, since Lucy had $56 left after buying all these items, we can conclude that she bought $\frac{164}{56} = 3$ multiples of packages of food.
Response:  Firstly, there are ten people already on the bus (including the driver). Then, four more people get on the bus, bringing the total number of passengers to 14. Since each bus can only carry up to 36 people, we know that the maximum number of people who could be on the bus is 36 - 10 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 people on the bus now.
Response:  Firstly, there are eight people already on the bus when it started moving. Then, ten more people boarded the bus at the next stop, so now there are eighteen people (8 + 10) on the bus. Finally, three people got off the bus, leaving twelve people still onboard (18 - 3). Therefore, there are twelve people currently on the bus.
Response:  Initially, there were 13 people at the bus stop. After four people got on the bus, there were 9 people left at the bus stop. Now, there are __________ people on the bus. Solution: 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 people on the bus now.
Response:  Initially, there were 11 people in the train carriage. If 8 more people boarded the train, then the total number of people in the carriage would be: 11 + 8 = 19. Therefore, there are 19 people in the train carriage.
Response:  We know that there are 22 parents and 676 audience members in total. Now, we need to find out how many students participated in each of the 10 items. To do this, we can divide the number of participants (676) by 10. So, the answer is: $ \boxed{676 / 10 = 67} $ Students participated in each item.
Response:  Firstly, we have 73 parents participating in the planning of the event. Then, there are 724 students who will be attending the event. Additionally, there are 744 teachers who will also be involved in some capacity. Therefore, the total number of people participating in this event is: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 174 parents and 521 students in total. Therefore, the ratio of parents to students is 174:521 or 3:6. So, for every one parent, there are six students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 61 parents and 177 students in total.  Next, we want to find out how many students can participate in the plan. From the information given, we know that the plan can accommodate 44 people. Therefore, we need to divide the number of students (177) by the capacity of the plan (44). So, the answer is: 177 / 44 = 4.04 or approximately 404 students can participate in the plan.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet (280 meters). To calculate the distance from the entrance to the deepest point in the cave, we need to subtract the length of the tunnel from the depth of the cave. So, the distance from the entrance to the deepest point = depth of the cave - length of the tunnel. In this case, the length of the tunnel is 1307 feet (400 meters), so the distance from the entrance to the deepest point = 919 - 1307 = -408 feet (-124 meters). Therefore, the deepest part of the cave is approximately 408 feet below the entrance.
"Response:  If the depth of the hole is 1,239 feet and the cave already has a depth of 849 feet, then the remaining distance to reach the bottom of the cave is:

Remaining distance = Total depth - Current depth
= 1,239 - 849
= 390 feet

So, if the creature moves at a speed of 17 feet per second, it will take:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 390 / 17
= approximately 23.5 seconds to reach the bottom of the cave."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the mountain is 659 feet and the depth of the cave is 762 feet. To find out how much deeper the cave is than the mountain, we need to subtract the height of the mountain from the depth of the cave: 762 - 659 = 133 feet. Therefore, the cave is 133 feet deeper than the mountain.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paige initially raised eight goldfish. Then, she let them swim in the pool along with six stray cats. Afterward, four of the goldfish disappeared. Therefore, there are three remaining goldfish left. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We have 7 goldfish and 12 stray cats. The stray cats are very interested in eating the goldfish, so they eat 15 of them. Therefore, there are 7 - 15 = 8 remaining goldfish.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 goldfish and 71 other fish in the pond. The stray cat liked to eat the goldfish, so it ate 2 of them. Therefore, the number of goldfish left in the pond is: 16 - 2 = 14 goldfish.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 goldfish in the pool.  Five people were eaten by the stray cat, so we have to subtract 5 from 15. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pool (15 - 5 = 10).
Response:  After boiling the egg, there are only two eggs left. So, initially, there were 43 - 2 = 41 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the teacher has 58 apples and eats 35 of them. So, the number of apples left with the teacher is: 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 apples left with the teacher after he eats 35 of them.
Response:  We know that there are 40 apples and 54 plums in total. After the teacher took some away, he had 39 apples left. Now we need to find out how many plums were taken away. Since the teacher has 39 apples left, if he used x plums, then he would have y apples left, where y = 39 - x. So, the number of plums used is x = 16 (since 39 - 16 = 23). Therefore, the teacher used 16 plums.
"Response:  Adam can place 11 animated dolls on each shelf, and there are four shelves in total. Therefore, the total number of animated dolls that Adam can accommodate is:

$$ \text {Total number of animated dolls} = \text{Number of shelves} \times \text{Number of dolls per shelf} $$
= 4 \times 11
= 44

So, Adam can accommodate 44 animated dolls in his room."
Response:  Adam can place 10 action figures on each shelf, and there are 8 shelves in total. Therefore, the number of action figures that Adam can store is: 10 x 8 = 80 action figures.
Response:  Adam can place eight action figures in each of the ten degrees (0-90). Therefore, he has a total of 8 x 10 = 80 action figures. Since there are four shelves in his room, he can accommodate 80 / 4 = 20 action figures per shelf. So, he can store up to 20 x 4 = 80 action figures in his room.
Response:  Each garden has 544 flowers in total.  Each flower has 32 petals, so there are 544 x 32 = 17,696 petals altogether. Therefore, there are 17,696 flowers in all.
Response:  We have 466 flowers and each flower has 53 stems of wood. Therefore, we have 466 x 53 = 24,098 stems of wood in total.
Response:  We have 141 flowers and each flower has 71 petals. Therefore, we have a total of 141 x 71 = 9671 petals. Now, there are 91 wooden sticks. Since each stick can be used to hold one bunch of flowers, we have a total of 91 / 1 = 91 bunches of flowers. So, the number of flowers held by all the wooden sticks is 9671 + 91 = 9762 flowers.
Response:  Each flower has 40 petals, so there are 40 flowers in total. Therefore, the number of flowers is 40 x 40 = 1600.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4502 pieces of artwork in Steven's collection and 4276 paintings. If we want to divide them into groups of 154 pieces each, we can do so as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per group
= 4502 / 154
= 29

So, if we divide the artworks and paintings into groups of 154 pieces each, there will be 29 such groups."
"Response:  If we have 3,941 paintings in Steven's collection and if we want to divide them into 495 groups of equal size, then each group will contain: Number of paintings per group = Total number of paintings / Number of groups = 3,941 / 495 = 7 
So, each group will contain 7 paintings."
Response:  Since there are 896 pieces of work in Steven's collection and he wants to divide them into 8 groups, each group will have how many pieces?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of pieces per group = Total number of pieces / Number of groups So, we have: Number of pieces per group = 896 / 8 = 112 pieces per group Therefore, if we divide the 517 paintings equally among 8 groups, each group will contain approximately 112 paintings.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each year has 5 students per class, then we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 years in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in total and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Total Number of Students = 304 x 75 Total Number of Students = 22,800 Therefore, there are 22,800 students in this school.
