841 - 34 = 807
Therefore, there are 807 more boys than girls in the school."
"Response: 193
Explanation: According to the question, there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. This means that the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 193 boys in this school."
"Response: 159
Explanation: According to the question, there are 697 girls in the school and 228 more girls than boys. Therefore, if X is the number of boys, we can set up the equation: 697 + 228 = X. Solving for X gives us 159 boys in the school."
Response:  There are 510 more boys than girls in this school. So there are 510 boys in the school.
"Response: 587
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x more girls than boys in the school. Since there are 868 girls and 587 boys, we can set up the equation:
x = 868 - 587 = 281
So, there are 281 more girls than boys in the school."
"Response: 558
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x number of girls in the school. Since there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, we can write an equation: x + (142) = 700. Solving for x gives us x = 558. Therefore, there are 558 students in the school, including both boys and girls."

Total number of students = 706 + 418 = 1124

Therefore, there are 1124 students in the school now, including both boys and girls."
"Response: 356
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initial number of girls = 902
* Number of new girls who joined the school = 44
* Total number of students in the school now = Girls + Boys

So, the total number of girls in the school after the new girls joined is:
Girls = Initial number of girls + New girls = 902 + 44 = 356
Therefore, there are 356 girls in the school now."
"Response: 732
Explanation:
The initial number of girls in the school is 632. Then, 465 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls now is 632 + 465 = 1097. The number of boys in the school remains unchanged at 410. Therefore, there are more girls than boys in the school by 1097 - 410 = 687."
"Response: 504
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initial number of girls = 732
* Number of new girls = 682
* Total number of girls now = initial number of girls + new girls
= 732 + 682
= 1414

Therefore, there are currently 504 girls in the school (1414 - 910)."

Explanation: According to the question, there are 458 more girls than boys in this school. If there are 692 girls, then there must be 304 boys (since 458 is greater than 0). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 304 + 304 = 608."
"Response: 185
Explanation:
The initial number of girls in the school is given as 257. The additional number of girls who joined the school is 403. Therefore, the total number of girls in the school now is:
257 + 403 = 659
Since the initial number of boys in the school was 362, and there are no new boys joining the school, the number of boys in the school remains unchanged at 362. So, the difference between the number of girls and boys in the school is:
659 - 362 = 297
Therefore, there are 185 more girls than boys in this school."

To determine how many more teaspoons of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required for the recipe. In this case, the recipe calls for 6 x 14 = 84 teaspoons of flour, so Mary needs to add an additional 84 - 28 = 56 teaspoons of flour."
Response: 5 szklanków cukru.
"Response: 2.5
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, Mary has already added 6 filiżanek (or teaspoons) of flour to make 3 pieces of pie crust. To determine how many more teaspoons she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of ingredients required by the number of pieces she wants to make. In this case, the recipe calls for 30 teaspoons of sugar, 40 teaspoons of flour, and 15 teaspoons of salt. Since Mary wants to make 3 pieces of pie crust, she will need to add an additional 3 x 30 = 90 teaspoons of sugar, 40 x 3 = 120 teaspoons of flour, and 15 x 3 = 45 teaspoons of salt. Therefore, Mary still needs to add 90 + 120 + 45 = 265 teaspoons of ingredients to make all 3 pieces of pie crust."

The passage states that ""Zima już prawie nadszedł"" which means winter is almost here and most animals migrate to warmer countries. It also mentions that there are 19 families of birds living near a mountain. If 60 families of birds have already migrated to escape the winter, then the number of families that remained behind is 60 - 19 = 41 families. Therefore, more families of birds stayed behind than those that left for winter, so the answer is 41 - 31 = 10 more families of birds stayed behind."
"Response: 120

Therefore, there are 105 bird families living near the mountain."
Response: 173 (49 + 24)
"Response: 34
Explanation:
The passage states that ""27 rodzin ptaków odlecielo na zimę z pobliża góry."" This means that 27 families of birds migrated away from the mountain for winter. The total number of families of birds living near the mountain before migration is given as 41. Therefore, the number of families of birds left behind after migration is:

Number of families of birds left behind = Total number of families of birds - Number of families that migrated away
= 41 - 27
= 14
So, there are 14 families of birds left near the mountain after the migration."
"Response: 21
Explanation:
The passage states that ""86 rodzin ptakow odleciaло na zimę"" which means 86 families of birds migrated for winter. The initial number of families of birds near the mountain was 45, so the number of families that remained after migration is:
45 - 86 = 0
Therefore, only one family of birds remains near the mountain after migration."

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
Zima (winter) has almost arrived and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. Near a mountain, there are 41 bird families. If 35 bird families flew to Asia and 62 flew to Africa, then how many more bird families flew to Africa than those that flew to Asia?
From the information provided, we can see that 35 + 62 = 97 bird families have migrated to either Asia or Africa. Since 41 - 35 = 6 bird families remained near the mountain, the number of bird families that flew to Africa is 97 - 6 = 91. Therefore, the answer is 91."
"Response: 50

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Zima już prawie nadszedł"" which means winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. It also mentions that there are 3 families of birds living near the mountain and 26 new families have arrived from Arctic while 2 families flew south for winter. Therefore, the total number of bird families near the mountain is 50 (3 + 26 = 50)."

Explanation:
The total number of books that Paul had was 115. He sold 78 books at a garage sale, which means he has 37 books left (115 - 78 = 37)."
"Response: 26

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Paul had ""kilka"" (Polish for ""several"") books.
* He sold 137 of them at a garage sale.
* After the sale, he was left with 105 books.

To find out how many books Paul had initially, we can use the following calculation:

Initial number of books = Number of books after the sale - Number of books sold at the garage sale
= 105 - 137
= -32

Since the result is negative, it means that Paul had more books than he sold at the garage sale. Therefore, his initial number of books was 26 (the absolute value of -32)."

* Each day they collect 38 works of pomegranates.
* Each work contains 42 pomegranates.

To find out how many works of pomegranates there will be after 49 days, we can multiply the number of days by the number of works collected per day:

38 works/day x 49 days = 1760 works (total)

Therefore, the answer to the question is 1760."

* The farmers are collecting pomegranates for 87 days.
* Each day they collect 66 works of pomegranates, and each work contains 25 pomegranates.

To find out how many pomegranates the farmers will have collected after 87 days, we need to multiply the number of works collected per day by the number of days they will be collecting pomegranates:

66 works/day x 87 days = 5,902 works

Since each work contains 25 pomegranates, the total number of pomegranates collected after 87 days is:

"Response:  $89 x 98 = $8520

Explanation:
The total amount earned from selling t-shirts during both games is given as $8520 (89 x 98). Since they sold 163 t-shirts in total, and 89 of them were sold during the game against Arkansas, the amount earned from selling t-shirts during that game is $8520 / 89 = $94.
Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $94 per t-shirt sold during the game against Arkansas."
"Response:  $109
Explanation:
The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during both games is given as $78 per shirt. Therefore, the total amount earned from selling t-shirts during the two games is:

$78 x 186 = $14,328

Since they sold 172 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, the amount earned from selling t-shirts during that game is:

$78 x 172 = $13,056

Therefore, the difference between the amount earned from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas and the game in Texas Tech is:

$14,328 - $13,056 = $1,272

So, they earned $1,272 more from selling t-shirts during the game in Texas Tech than they did during the game in Arkansas."

Therefore, the total revenue from selling Razorback shirts is $192 x 157 = $30,682, and the total revenue from selling Red Raiders shirts is $19 x 19 = $359. So, the price of each Red Raiders shirt is more than each Razorback shirt by $359 - $30,682 = $328.
Response:  The cost of each Razorback shirt is $86 and $232, respectively. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 254 shirts and 43 shirts. Therefore, the price of each shirt that costs more than another shirt is $232 - $86 = $146.

In this case, they sold 158 t-shirts at $76 each and 2 t-shirts at $204 each, for a total of:
Total = 158 x $76 + 2 x $204 = $134
Therefore, they earned $134 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the game."
"Response:  $210 - $240 = -$30

Explanation:
The cost of each shirt is $210 and $240 respectively. Since they sold 177 shirts at $210 each and 23 shirts at $240 each, the total revenue from shirts is:

Revenue from shirts = Number of shirts x Price per shirt
= 177 x $210
+ 23 x $240
= $38,560 + $5,320
= $43,880

Since they spent $43,880 in total, the profit from shirts is:

Profit from shirts = Revenue from shirts - Cost of shirts
= $43,880 - ($210 x 177)
= $43,880 - $39,610
= $4,270

Therefore, the profit from each shirt is:

Profit per shirt = Profit from shirts / Number of shirts sold
= $4,270 / (177 + 23)
= $4,270 / 200
= $21

So, each shirt costs more than $21."

"Response:  $3948
Explanation:
Lewis Zarabia earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, which is equal to $45,320. Since he has to pay $702 in taxes, his net income after taxes would be $44,618. To find out how much money he will have at the end of the season, we need to subtract the amount he paid in taxes from his net income, which gives us $44,618 - $702 = $43,916. Therefore, Lewis Zarabia will have $3948 left over at the end of the season."
"Response:  The total amount earned by Lewis can be calculated as follows:

Lewis earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks of the season. Therefore, his total earnings for one season are:

$1357 x 223 = $294,610

Since Lewis will work for 73 seasons, his total lifetime earnings can be calculated as follows:

Based on the given information, this is equal to $465 per week.
"Response:  $16587
Explanation:
Lewis Zarabia earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvesting. This means he earns a total of $93,540 ($403 x 233) during the season. If he has to pay $49 per week in rent, then his total earnings after rent is $92,941 ($93,540 - $49)."
"Response: 4702 dollars
Explanation:
To find out how much money Lewis pays as rent in a season of harvesting, we need to subtract the amount he earns from his weekly salary and divide it by the number of weeks in a season.

Response: 360 places (21 classes x 98 students / class).
Response: 84 x 95 = 8020 students in the school.
"Response: 10
Explanation:
The school has 67 classes, and each class has 66 students, so there are a total of 67 x 66 = 4282 students going on the field trip. Since each student needs a seat in an bus, the school will need 4282 / 6 = 713 buses to transport all the students. Therefore, the answer is 10 buses."
"Response: 2
Explanation:
The number of classes in the school is given as 87. Since each class has an equal number of students (58), we can assume that there are 58 students per class.
Since there are 2 places in the bus for every 3 students, we need 58/3 = 19 buses to accommodate all the students. Therefore, the answer is 2."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has an equal number of students, so there are 120/12 = 10 students in each class. Since there are 24 classes, the total number of students is 24 x 10 = 240. However, since there are only 84 seats available in each bus, the total number of students who can go on the field trip must be divided by the number of buses available, which is 84. Therefore, the number of students who can go on the field trip from each class is 240 / 84 = 30."
"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 102 students in total and 8 places available per bus, then the maximum number of buses needed is:

102 students / 8 seats per bus = 13 buses
Since 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, we subtract their number from the total number of students:

102 students - 22 students = 80 students
Now, we divide the remaining students by the number of seats available per bus:

80 students / 8 seats per bus = 10 buses
Therefore, 3 buses are needed for the field trip."
Response: 34 students will go on the field trip.
"Response: 9
Explanation: If there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students, then the total number of students is 72 x 3 = 216. Since there are only 111 students in the school, it means that at least 105 students (216 - 111) will need to take the field trip. Therefore, the school needs at least 9 buses (105 / 3 = 9)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If all 46 buses are full (i.e., each bus has 92 students), then there will be a total of 46 x 92 = 4080 seats available for the field trip. Since there are 17 classes in the school, this means that each class will have an average of 4080 / 17 = 243 seats per class. Therefore, there will be 5 seats per bus (since each bus can seat up to 92 students)."

"Response: 39
Explanation:
The book had 555 pages, and Frank took 220 days to finish it. Therefore, each chapter must have an average of pages per day.
We can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:
Pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
= 555 / 5
= 111 pages per chapter
So, each chapter has approximately 111 pages."
"Response: 2.78

To find out how many chapters Frank read daily, we need to divide the total number of chapters (15) by the time it took him to finish the book (660 days). Therefore, Frank read approximately 2.78 chapters per day."
"Response: 70
Explanation:
The book had 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish it. Therefore, he read 249 / 3 = 86 pages per day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide 86 by 24 to get the number of pages read per hour, which is 86 / 24 = 3.5 pages per hour. Finally, since Frank spent 3 days reading the book, he read a total of 3.5 x 3 = 10.5 pages per day."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it took Frank 12 days to finish each book, and he read 66 pages per book. Therefore, if it took him 492 days to read all the books, he must have read 5 books (492 / 12 = 5)."

"Response: 975
Explanation:
The book had 41 chapters with 450 pages each, so the total number of pages in the book is 41 x 450 = 18,600 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to read the book, he read an average of 18,600 / 30 = 620 pages per day."
Response:  Each chapter has 128 pages.
"Response: 13
Explanation:
The book had 2 chapters with 405 pages each, and it took Frank 664 days to finish reading it. Therefore, he read one chapter every 664 / 2 = 332 days or approximately 13 chapters per year."
Response:  $120 / 6 = $20 per pack.
Response: 33 x $81 = $2633.
"Response: 4
Explanation:
Let's assume that the cost of one DVD is $107. If there is a discount of $106 on each package, then the cost of each package would be:
$107 - ($106 x number of packages) = $107 - $106^n
where n is the number of packages being bought.
Given that the total cost for 93 dollars is desired, we can set up the equation:
$107 - ($106^n) = 93
To find out how many packages can be bought with 93 dollars, we need to solve for n in the above equation:
n = log($93/$107) / log(106)
= ln(93/107)/ln(106)
= -5
Therefore, 4 packages of DVD can be bought for 93 dollars."

33 x 26 = 842
However, since we were asked how many Frank had initially, we subtract the number he gave away:
842 - 33 x 26 = 330
Therefore, Frank initialy had 330 cukierków."

Response: 40 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda are available in the store.
Response: 30 more butelki dietetycznej sody than zwykłej soda.
Response: 79 butelek (30 + 8 + 41 = 79)
Response:  There are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in the store. Therefore, there are more than 79 - 53 = 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  There are 83 butelki zwykłej sody and 54 butelki dietetycznej sody in the store. Therefore, there are more than 83 butelki of regular soda than dietetic soda. The exact difference is 54 - 83 = -39 butelki.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 17 bottles of soft drinks in total, and 9 of them were regular soft drinks. Therefore, the number of dietetic sodas is 8 (17 - 9). Since they had 29 apples, each person drank 3/29 = 0.1064 (or approximately 1/10) of a dietetic soda."
"Response: 30

Response:  There are still 27 bottles of soda (but not jabokcs).
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 30 bottles of drinks in total, and 28 of them were regular drinks. Therefore, the number of dietetic sodas is 7 (30 - 28 = 2)."
"Response: 35
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of butelki dietetycznej sody is x. Since they had 4 butelki dietetycznej sody in the store, we know that x - 4 = 79 (the difference between the number of butelki zwykłej sody and dietetycznej). Therefore, x = 83 (since 79 + 4 = 83). So, there were 83 butelki zwykłej sody in the store."
Response: 100 butelek (57 + 26 + 27)
"Response: 49
Question: How many more butelek of regular soda are there than dietetic soda?  Solution: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 49 more butelek of regular soda than dietetic soda."

"Response: 42
Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* In the previous day, there were 295 guests at the Palace of Buckingham.
* Today, there are 317 guests at the Palace of Buckingham.

To find out how many more guests visited the palace today than yesterday, we need to subtract the number of guests yesterday from the number of guests today:

317 - 295 = 22

Therefore, 22 more guests visited the Palace of Buckingham today than yesterday."
"Response: 189
Explanation:
If there were 703 guests at the palace in the previous day and Rachel found out that 246 of them visited the palace, then we can calculate how many guests visited the palace over a period of 25 days as follows:

Number of guests who visited the palace = Total number of guests / Number of days
= 703 / 25
= 189
Therefore, the answer is 189."
"Response: 234
Explanation:
Let X be the number of people who visited the Palace yesterday. Since 100 guests came today and there were 666 people in total, we can write an equation:
X + 100 = 666... (1)
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 566... (2)
So, 566 more people visited the Palace today than yesterday."
"Response: 589
Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:
* ""Po obfitym posiłku poszli zobaczyć Pałac Buckingham."" (After lunch, they went to see Buckingham Palace.)
* ""Tam Rachel dowiedzała się, że 132 gości прибыло до Pałacu Buckingham tego dnia."" (There, Rachel learned that 132 guests had arrived at Buckingham Palace today.)
* ""Jeśli 406 osób odwiedziło Pałac Buckingham w ciągu ostatnich 327 dni, то ilu gości odwiedziło Pałac Buckingham w poprzednim dniu?"" (If 406 people visited Buckingham Palace over the last 327 days, how many guests visited Buckingham Palace the day before?)
From these statements, we can deduce that there were 132 + 406 = 538 total guests who visited Buckingham Palace during the time period mentioned in the question. Therefore, if 132 guests arrived at Buckingham Palace yesterday, then the number of guests who visited the palace the previous day would be 538 - 132 = 406."
"Response: 1037

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* The number of guests who visited the Palace yesterday was 45.
* The total number of guests who visited the Palace over the past 85 days was 829.

To find out how many guests visited the Palace on that particular day, we can use the following calculation:

Number of guests on that day = Total number of guests / Number of days since the last time the palace was visited
= 829 / 85
= 1037

Therefore, the answer to the question is 1037."
"Response: 309
Explanation:
Let X be the number of guests who visited the Palace in the previous day.
From the given information, we know that there were 188 guests in total during the 57 days. So, the average number of guests per day is:
X = Total number of guests / Number of days = 188 / 57 = 3.26
Now, let's find out how many guests visited the palace on the day when Rachel learned about the 71 paintings:
Number of guests on that day = Average number of guests per day x (number of days since the last visit) + Last visit = 3.26 x (57 - 55) + 557 = 3.26 x 26 + 557 = 740
Therefore, the number of guests who visited the Palace Buckingham on the day Rachel saw the 71 paintings was 740."
"Response: 71
Explanation:
Let X be the number of guests who visited the Palace yesterday. We know that today there were 661 guests and in the previous day there were 600 guests. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
X + 71 = 661
We also know that X - 71 = 600
Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously:
X = 82
So, the number of guests who visited the Palace today is 82 more than the number of guests who visited it yesterday."
"Response: 568
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Today, 92 guests visited the Buckingham Palace.
* Yesterday, 419 people visited the palace.
* The day before yesterday, 103 people visited the palace.

So, we have three pieces of information about the number of visitors to the palace over the past few days:

* Today: 92 guests
* Yesterday: 419 people
* Day before yesterday: 103 people

We can use these numbers to find out how many people visited the palace before today:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors today + Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors day before yesterday
= 92 + 419 + 103
= 614

Therefore, before today, 614 people visited the Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  The number of people who visited the Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days is:

$$ \boxed{363} $$

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Tam Rachel dowiedzała się, że tego dnia w Pałacu Buckingham przybyło 512 gości.""
* ""Jeśli 471 osób odwiedziło Pałac poprzedniego dnia...""
* ""...i 808 gości dzień wcześniej, то ilu z nich odwiedziło Pałac Buckingham w ciągu ostatnich 89 dni?""

From the first sentence, we know that 512 guests visited the palace today. From the second and third sentences, we know that 471 and 808 guests visited the palace yesterday and the day before respectively. Therefore, the total number of guests who visited the palace in the last 89 days can be calculated as follows:

Total number of guests = Number of guests today + Number of guests yesterday + Number of guests the day before
= 512 + 471 + 808
= 1891

So, the number of people who visited the Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days is 1891."
Response:  The number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham today is 368 more than the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days.  Therefore, if there were 705 guests at the palace today, and 191 guests yesterday, then the total number of guests over the past 245 days would be:  705 + 191 = 896.
Response:  The artist has already used 159 grams of wax and needs an additional 159 grams to complete the painting. If the feathers require 628 grams of wax, then the artist has 469 grams (628 - 159) of wax left.
Response: 172 grams
"Response: 164 grams
Explanation:
The total amount of wax needed for painting is 57g + 22g = 79g. Since the artist already has 164g of wax, they have enough for the painting and don't need any more."
Response:  He still needs 146 grams of wax (166 - 20 = 146).
"Response: 306 grams
Explanation:
The problem states that the man has 557 grams of wax and needs only 17 grams more to have enough for all his feathers. Therefore, if he currently has 557 grams of wax, then he will need 306 grams of wax in total (557 - 17 = 306)."
Response: 3650 grams (g)
"Response: 12
Explanation:
The passage states that out of 94 people, 90 beckets of grapes were filled in 6 days. To find out how many beckets are filled daily, we can divide the total number of beckets by the number of days taken to fill them:
12 (beckets/day) = 90 (total beckets)/6 (days)
Therefore, 12 beckets of grapes are filled every day."
"Response: 31
Explanation:
The passage states that in 5 days, 266 gatherers filled 90 barrels of grapes. To find out how many barrels were filled each day, we can divide the total number of barrels by the number of days: 90 / 5 = 18 barrels per day."
"Response: 3058

Explanation:
To find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled in 146 days, we need to divide the total number of grapes collected by the number of days. In this case, the total number of grapes collected is 294 x 244 = 67,560 grape clusters, and there are 3058 days in 146 years (assuming a year has 365 days). Therefore, the answer is 67,560 / 3058 = approximately 22.3 barrels per day."
"Response: 4698/77 = 60
Explanation: To find out how many bunches of grapes will be filled in 77 days, we need to divide the total number of bunches by the number of days. In this case, there are 221 bunches of grapes per day, so divided by 77 days is equal to 60 bunches."
"Response: 3960

Explanation:
The given information can be used to calculate the number of days it takes for the grape harvesters to fill 108 buckets of grapes per day. If there are 252 grape pickers and they fill 108 buckets per day, then the total number of buckets filled in one day is:

252 grape pickers × 108 buckets/day = 27,440 buckets/day

To find out how many days it will take to fill 3960 buckets (as mentioned in the problem), we divide the total number of buckets by the number of buckets filled per day:

3960 buckets / 27,440 buckets/day = 58 days

Therefore, the answer is 58 days."
"Response: 15 days
Explanation:
The number of days required to fill 240 barrels of grapes can be calculated as follows:

Number of days = Number of barrels / Daily output of gatherers
= 240 / 8
= 30 days

Therefore, it will take 30 days for the 36 gatherers to fill 240 barrels of grapes."
Response:  Each aquarium contains 52 species of saltwater fish, and there are 26 aquariums in total. Therefore, each aquarium contains 52 / 26 = 20 different species of saltwater fish.

"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the passage, Tyler has 56 aquariums for marine animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Since each aquarium contains 39 animals, the total number of marine animals in all 56 aquariums is 56 x 39 = 2174. Therefore, Tyler has 2174 marine animals."
"Response: 108

Explanation:
The given information can be summarized as follows:

* Tyler has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals.
* Each aquarium contains 46 animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in all aquariums is:
74 x 46 = 3360 (freshwater animals) + 22 x 46 = 972 (saltwater animals) = 4332 animals."
"Response: 470
Explanation:
The number of aquariums for freshwater animals is given as 62. Each aquarium has 19 fish, so the total number of fish in all the aquariums is:
62 x 19 = 1138
Since each aquarium also contains saltwater animals, we need to add their numbers to the total. The question mentions that there are 15 aquariums for saltwater animals, and each aquarium contains 19 fish, so the total number of saltwater fish is:
15 x 19 = 285
Adding these two totals gives us the final answer of 1138 + 285 = 1423."

Response:  The number of smears that the letter carrier should deliver to each house is 24 / 6 = 4.
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Lidropski is distributing 14 pieces of trash to each house in the block. If he has to give 2 pieces of trash to each block, then there are 14/2 = 7 blocks in total."
Response: 400 (32 x 12 = 400)
"Response: 45
Explanation:
The total number of smears that Poczta receives is 30 x 78 = 2340. Since there are 19 houses per block, and there are 78 blocks in total, the number of smears each house should receive is 2340 / 19 = 123. So, Poczta should give 123 smears to each house."
"Response: 100
Explanation:
The number of houses in each block is given as 55. Since there are 8 trash cans for every house, the total number of trash cans in all blocks is 55 x 8 = 440.
If Poczta delivers 32 letters to each house, then the total number of letters delivered to all houses in one block is 32 x 100 = 3200. Therefore, there are 440 / 3200 = 100 houses in each block."
"Response: 360 (12 x 81)

Explanation:
The question states that there are 4 lists being delivered to each of the 81 districts in the city. Since there are 12 houses in each block, and there are 81 districts in total, we can calculate the number of trash bags that should be delivered to each district as follows:

Number of trash bags per district = Number of houses in each block x Total number of districts
= 12 x 81
= 972

So, the correct answer is 972 trash bags."

Therefore, the total number of children at the camp is:
Total number of children at the camp = Number of children in the county + Number of children from other countries at the camp
= 168911 + 424944
= 593855
So, there were 593855 children at the camp."

Response:  Minutes = Koshules / Time taken to make one koshule x Time taken to complete task  Minutes = 6/3 x 1 = 2 minutes
"Response: 20
Explanation:
The machine worked for 5 minutes, which means it produced 5 x 60 = 300 units (koshules) in total."
Response: 180 minutes (or 3 hours)
Response: 42 minutes. Explanation: If the machine produced 13 koshuls yesterday and 3 today, it means that the production rate is lower today than yesterday. Specifically, the machine produced at half the rate it did yesterday (13/2 = 6.5). Therefore, if the machine worked for x minutes today, it would have produced 6.5x koshuls in total. Since we know that the machine produced 8 koshuls per minute, this means that it worked for 6.5/8 = 81.25 minutes today. So, the answer is 42 minutes.
Response: 4 minutes. Explanation: If the machine produced 8 koshuls today and it can produce 2 koshuls per minute, then it worked for 4 minutes to produce those 8 koshuls.
Response: 20 minutes
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The machine can produce 6 koshuls per minute, so in 12 minutes it will be able to produce 72 koshuls (12 x 6 = 72). And today, when it worked for 14 minutes, it produced an additional 96 koshuls (14 x 6 = 84 + 96 = 180). Therefore, the total number of koshuls produced by the machine is 180."
Response:  The machine produced 72 koshuls today (12 x 6 = 72).

Response:  The number of action figures that can be placed on each shelf is 11. Since there are 4 shelves and 40 safes in Adam's room, the total number of action figures he can place on his shelves is 4 x 11 = 44.
"Response: 4
Explanation:
Adam could place 10 figures on each of his 8 shelves in his room, so he would have 8 x 10 = 80 figures total. Since his room can hold 8 figures, this means that Adam had 80 / 8 = 10 half-shelves or 5 full shelves worth of space in his room. Therefore, Adam had 4 half-shelves or 2 full shelves worth of space in his room."
"Response:  The number of figures and safes that can be placed in each shelf is given as 8 and 10 respectively. Since there are 4 shelves in total, we have:

Number of figures that can be placed = 8 x 4 = 32
Number of safes that can be placed = 10 x 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of things that could be stored in Adam's room are:

32 + 40 = 72"

Response:  Each group contains approximately 28 Skittles and 29 gummies.
Response:  Each group of gum contains 10 pieces, so there are 4950/10 = 495 groups of gum.
"Response: 43
Explanation:
Let's assume that Steven has $n$ Skittles in total. Since he also has 517 gummies and 90 lollipops, we can write:
$$n = 896 + 517 + 90 = 1403$$
Since there are 8 groups of Skittles, we can divide $n$ by 8 to find the size of each group:
$$\frac{n}{8} = \frac{1403}{8} = 174$$
So, each group contains $\boxed{174}$ Skittles."
