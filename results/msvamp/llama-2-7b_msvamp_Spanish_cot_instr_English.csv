Response:  If Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday, then she played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is 8 (18 - 10). Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday, then she played with 12 + 11 = 23 children in total. So, she played with more children on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played tic-tac-toe with 5 children on Monday and then played with some more children on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 15 children. Since we know that she didn't play with all 15 children on Monday, we can conclude that she played with 5 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday (since 15 - 5 = 10). Therefore, Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played tic-tac-toe with some children on Monday and then she played it again with more children on Tuesday. So, let's assume that she played with x number of children on Monday and y number of children on Tuesday. Now, we are told that she played with a total of 16 children. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + y = 16. Can you solve for x now?
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday (day 1), and then she played with 12 more children on Tuesday (day 2), we can say that Julia played with a total of 16 + 12 = 28 children on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played with 28 children on Martes.
"Response:  If Julia played tuta with 14 children on Tuesday (martes), and she also played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday, then...

Step 1: How many children did Julia play tuta with on Monday?
Let's assume that Julia played tuta with x children on Monday.

Step 2: How many children did Julia play tuta with in total?
Julia played tuta with 14 children on Tuesday plus 8 children on Monday = 22 children in total.

So, the answer is x + 14 = 22.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16.

Therefore, Julia played tuta with 16 children on Monday."
Response:  On Monday (el lunes), Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday (el martes), she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday (el miércoles), she played with 2 children. So in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, in total, she played with 15 + 18 = 33 children on those two days. Now, we are asked how many children she played with on Wednesday. According to the question, she played with 97 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is 33 (the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday) + 97 = 130. So, Julia played with 130 children in total.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 5 children on Monday (lunes), 9 children on Tuesday (martes), and 15 children on Wednesday (miércoles). So, she played with a total of 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children. Therefore, she played with 5 children on Monday and 9 children on Wednesday.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 2 children on Monday, 14 children on Tuesday, and 16 children on Wednesday. So, she played with a total of 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 children. Therefore, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday (Martes) and 16 children on Wednesday (Miércoles).
Response:  We know that Julia played with 9 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday. So, the total number of children she played with on those two days is: 9 + 7 = 16. Now we are asked how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To find this difference, subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number she played with on Monday: 16 - 7 = 9. Therefore, Julia played with 9 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 14 children on Monday and 2 children on Tuesday. So, the total number of children she played with on Monday is greater than the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of children she played with on Wednesday. That is, 14 - 2 = 12. So, Julia played with 12 more children on Wednesday than she did on Monday.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Julia played with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. So, we can write down the following equation:

Monday = 8
Tuesday > 11 (greater than)
Wednesday < 9 (less than)
Now, let's compare the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday and Wednesday:

11 - 9 = 2
So, Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than she did on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Martes > Miércoles (Tuesday greater than Wednesday)"
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Julia played with 15 children on Monday (L), 18 children on Tuesday (T), and 7 children on Wednesday (W). To find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the total number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday:

Monday (L): 15 children x = 15
Tuesday (T): 18 children x = 18
Wednesday (W): 7 children x = 7
Total number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday = 15 + 18 = 33
Number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday more than on Wednesday = Total number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday - Number of children she played with on Wednesday
= 33 - 7
= 26
Therefore, Julia played with 26 more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday."
Response:  Julia played with 13 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 23 children. Then, she played cards with 15 children on Wednesday, adding to the previous total of 23, so in total Julia played with 38 children.
Response:  Julia played with 7 children on Monday and 13 children on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 7 + 13 = 20 children on those days. Then, she played cards with 20 children on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with 20 + 20 = 40 children.
Response:  If Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 children. So, Julia played with 26 children in total.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, in total, she played with 19 + 18 = 37 children. Therefore, Julia played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played tic-tac-toe with 5 children on Tuesday and 6 children on Monday. So, we can write an equation as follows: 5 + x = 6 (where x is the number of children Julia played with on Monday). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Julia played tic-tac-toe with 1 more child on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Monday and still had some more to play with on Tuesday. So, she played with at least 4 + x children on Tuesday, where x is the number of children she didn't play with on Monday. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = 4 + x.
"Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 4 children on Wednesday, 6 children on Monday, and 17 children on Tuesday. So, we can write down the information as follows:

Wednesday (4 children) + Monday (6 children) = Total number of children on both days
Total number of children on both days = 4 + 6 = 10

Now, let's compare the total number of children on Monday and Wednesday:

Monday (6 children) > Wednesday (4 children)
So, Julia played with more than 6 children on Monday than she did on Wednesday. In other words, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is greater than 6. We can express this mathematically as:

|Monday - Wednesday| > 6

Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many more children did Julia play with on Monday than on Wednesday?"" is:

More than 6 children."
Response:  If Bobby had eaten some candy pieces initially and then ate 25 more, that means he ate a total of 25 + initial amount = 43 pieces of candy. So, the initial amount was 43 - 25 = 18 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy and then ate 42 more, he has eaten in total 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. However, we are also told that he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. So, if he ate 70 pieces of candy, how many pieces of chocolate did he eat? We know that each piece of chocolate is equal to 1/3 of a piece of candy, so if he ate 70 pieces of candy, he must have eaten 70 / 3 = 23 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 70 + 23 = 93 pieces of sweets.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then he ate 4 more. So, in total, he ate 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Additionally, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, in total, Bobby ate 37 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.
Response:  If Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and then ate 36 more, that means he ate in total 74 pieces of candy (38 + 36 = 74). Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. So, if he ate 74 pieces of candy, how many more did he eat than he did of chocolate? To find out, subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the number of candy pieces: 74 - 16 = 58. Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of candy than he did of chocolate.
Response:  If Bobby had 20 pieces of candy initially and he ate 34 pieces, then he has 20 - 34 = -14 pieces of candy left. Then, he eats another 18 pieces, so now he has -14 + 18 = 3 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially. Then he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Later, he ate another 9 pieces. So, he now has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby has 25 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 22 pieces of candy and he ate some, then he had x number of pieces left. After that, he ate 5 more pieces, so now he has x + 5 pieces left. Since there are still 8 pieces left, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, Bobby initially had 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate 2 pieces, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left. So, there are 17 pieces of candy left for Bobby to eat.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some, then he has fewer pieces of candy left. So, if he has 20 pieces of candy left, that means he ate 12 pieces of candy (32 - 20 = 12).
Response:  If Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy and he ate 17 at first, then he has 36 - 17 = 19 remaining pieces of candy. Then, if he ate an additional 15 pieces, he would have 19 - 15 = 4 remaining pieces of candy. So, there are 4 pieces of candy left for Bobby.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 30 pieces of candy and he ate 23, then he has 7 remaining (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  If Allan led 5 balloons and Jake led 3 balloons to the park, then we can say that Allan had 5 - 3 = 2 more balloons than Jake at the park. So, the correct answer is 2.
Response:  If Allan llevo 2 globos and Jake carried 3 globos to the park, then we can say that Allan had x globos in the park (where x is a number). Since Jake had 3 more globos than Allan, we can write an equation as follows: Jake had x + 3 globos in the park. Now, we need to solve for the value of x. We know that Jake had 3 more globos than Allan, so if Allan had x globos, Jake had x + 3 globos. Therefore, we can substitute x = 2 into the equation to get: Jake had 2 + 3 = 5 globos in the park. So, Jake had 5 globos more than Allan in the park.
Response:  If Alan carried 2 globes and Jake carried 3 globes to the park, then together they carried 5 globes (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, Jake carried 3 globes to the park.
"Response:  If Jake carried 6 balls to the park and he carried 4 more than what Allan carried, then...

Jake carried 6 + 4 = 10 balls to the park."
Response:  If Alan carried 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 6 more than what Alan carried, then Jake carried 6 + 5 = 11 balls to the park. Therefore, Jake carried 11 balls to the park.
"Response: 
Allan had 3 globos initially and then bought 2 more in the park. So, he had 3 + 2 = 5 globos in total.
Jake had 5 globos initially. Then, Allan had 5 + 2 = 7 globos in total. Therefore, Allan had 7 globos in the park, while Jake still had 5 globos."
Response:  Allan had 2 globos initially and then bought 3 more in the park. So, Allan has 5 globos (2 + 3) now. Jake had 4 globos initially. Therefore, Allan has 5 - 4 = 1 more globe than Jake in the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 globos initially and then bought 3 more in the park. So, Allan has 5 globos (2 + 3) now. Jake had 6 globos initially. Therefore, Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 globe more than Allan in the park.
Response:  Allan initially had 5 globos and then bought 3 more in the park. So, he carried a total of 5 + 3 = 8 globos to the park. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.
Response:  Allan had 6 globos initially and then bought none. Jake had 0 globos initially and then bought 3 more in the park. So, at the end of this process, Jake has 3 more globos than Allan. Therefore, the difference between the number of globos Allan had and the number of globos Jake had is equal to 3. In other words, if A represents the number of globos Allan had and J represents the number of globos Jake had, we can write the equation: A - J = 3. Solving for J (the number of globos Jake had), we get: J = A + 3. Substituting the value given in the question (A = 6), we get: J = 6 + 3 = 9. So, Jake had 9 globos in the park.
Response:  Allan had 6 globos and Jake had 3 globos initially. Then, Jake bought 4 more globos in the park, so he had 7 globos (3 + 4) in total. Therefore, Jake had 1 more globe than Allan in the park. Answer: 8
Response:  Allan brought 5 globos to the park and then Jake bought 3 more globos in the park. So, Jake brought 5 + 3 = 8 globos to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan carried 3 globos and 20 pelotas to the park. So, he had 3 + 20 = 23 objects in total. Now, we are told that Jake carried 5 globos and 59 pelotas to the park. Therefore, Jake had 5 + 59 = 64 objects in total. So, Allan had fewer objects than Jake at the park.
Response:  We know that Allan had 7 globos and 5 pelotas in total. So he must have brought 7 + 5 = 12 pelotas to the park. Now we know that Jake had 6 globos and 4 pelotas in total. So he must have brought 6 + 4 = 10 pelotas to the park. Therefore, Allan had 12 - 10 = 2 pelotas more than Jake at the park.
Response:  If Allan trajo 5 globos and he is together with Jake who brought 6 globos to the park, then we can say that Jake brought x globos to the park (where x is a number). Since they both went to the park together, the total number of globos they brought is equal to the sum of the number of globos Allan brought plus the number of globos Jake brought: 5 + x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 1. So, Jake brought 1 globo to the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 globes initially and then bought 3 more. So, in total, Allan had 5 globes (2 + 3) at the park. Now, Jake brought 6 globes to the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of globes that Allan had and the number of globes that Jake brought is 6 - 5 = 1 globe. So, Jake had 1 globe more than Allan at the park.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 2 hours learning Chinese every day. So, in total, he spends 8 hours (6 + 2) learning both languages together. Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning English than Chinese. The difference between the number of hours spent learning English and Chinese is 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day and 7 hours learning Chinese. So, he learns English for 6 hours + 7 hours = 13 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning Chinese than English. The difference in hours is 7 - 6 = 1 hour.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and some additional time learning Chinese every day, then he spends a total of x hours learning Chinese per day. Since he spends a total of 4 hours studying both languages each day, we can set up the equation:
x + 3 = 4... (1)
Now, we know that Ryan spends 3 hours learning English every day, so we can substitute this value into equation (1):
x + 3 = 4
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1
So, Ryan spends 1 hour learning Chinese every day."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends x hours learning Chinese. Since he spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 2 = 7... (1)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 2 from both sides of Equation (1):
x = 5... (2)
Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese."
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese and some additional time learning English. If he spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, then... (1 mark)
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. If he studies for 5 days, then he will spend a total of:
English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
Therefore, in total, Ryan will spend 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages."
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day he will spend 6 + 5 = 11 hours studying. Since he studies for 2 days, he will spend 11 hours x 2 = 22 hours studying English altogether.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours learning English every day, so in one week he will have spent 5 x 7 = 35 hours learning English.
Similarly, he spends 4 hours learning Chinese every day, so in one week he will have spent 4 x 7 = 28 hours learning Chinese.
Therefore, in total, Ryan has spent 35 + 28 = 63 hours learning both English and Chinese during the week."
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend in total 4 x 86 = 352 hours learning English and 6 x 86 = 504 hours learning Chinese during those 86 days. So, each day he will spend 352/86 = 4.1 hours learning English and 504/86 = 5.9 hours learning Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day, which means he learns for 12 days in a week (since there are 7 days in a week). So, the number of hours he spends learning English per week is: 6 x 12 = 72 hours/week. Similarly, he spends 7 hours learning Chinese and 3 hours learning Spanish, so his total time spent learning these three languages per week is: 7 + 3 = 10 hours/week. Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 72 + 10 = 82 hours/week learning English, Chinese, and Spanish.
Response:  According to the given information, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 3 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 6 x 24 = 144 hours in one week and Chinese for 3 x 24 = 72 hours in one week. Now, we need to find out how many more hours Ryan learns English than Spanish. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours he learns Chinese from the total number of hours he learns English. So, the difference between the two is: 144 - 72 = 72 hours. Therefore, Ryan learns English for 72 additional hours each week than he does Chinese.
Response:  According to the given information, Ryan spends 7 hours learning English every day and 4 hours learning Spanish every day. So, he learns English for 7 + 7 = 14 hours per day and Spanish for 4 + 4 = 8 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning English than Spanish. The difference in hours is 14 - 8 = 6 hours.
"Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 2 hours learning English every day. Therefore, he learns 14 hours of English per week (2 hours/day x 7 days/week). 
He also spends 5 hours learning Chinese and 4 hours learning Spanish. So, he learns 9 hours of Chinese and 16 hours of Spanish per week (5 hours/day x 7 days/week). 
Now, let's find out how many hours more Ryan learns Chinese than Spanish: Total hours learned Chinese = 9 hours/week Total hours learned Spanish = 16 hours/week Difference between total hours learned Chinese and Spanish = Total hours learned Chinese - Total hours learned Spanish = 9 - 16 = -7 hours/week Ryan learns less Chinese than Spanish by 7 hours per week."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English every day, then he learns English for x hours per day. Since he also spends time learning Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 2 = 3 (where x is the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1
So, Ryan spends 1 hour learning Chinese every day."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends in total:
English = 4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours
Chinese = 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours
So, Ryan passes in total 63 hours (28 + 35) learning both languages."
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 bags of cans. If she found 7 more bags on Tuesday, then the total number of bags she had on Monday and Tuesday is:
8 + 7 = 15
So, Tiffany had 15 bags of cans in total on Monday and Tuesday."
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 7 bags of cans. If she found 12 more bags on Tuesday, then the total number of bags she has now is:
7 + 12 = 19
So, Tiffany found 13 more bags of cans than she had on Monday."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 bags of cans. If she found some more bags on Tuesday, then the total number of bags she has is 6 (Monday + Tuesday). So, Tiffany found 2 additional bags of cans on Tuesday.
Response:  If Tiffany had some cans on Monday and found 4 more bags of cans on Tuesday, then she must have had 8 bags in total. So, the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday is 8/2 = 4.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 10 bags of cans. Then she found 3 more bags on Tuesday, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 bags of cans. On Wednesday, she found another 7 bags, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 bags of cans in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany found 8 bags of cans. Then, on Tuesday (day 2), she found 10 more bags of cans, so the total number of bags found after day 1 is 8 + 10 = 18 bags. Finally, on Wednesday (day 3), she found 4 more bags of cans, bringing the total to 18 + 4 = 22 bags. Therefore, Tiffany found a total of 22 bags of cans after the Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 3 bags of cans. Then, she found 7 more bags of cans and 44 bags of bottles. So, in total, Tiffany has 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red duraznos and 16 green duraznos in the basket. So, if we add these numbers together, we get 33 (17 + 16). Therefore, there are 33 duraznos in total in the basket - 17 of them are red and 16 are green.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red duraznos and 11 green duraznos in the basket. So, if we subtract the number of red duraznos from the total number of duraznos, we will get the number of green duraznos. Therefore, the answer is: 11 - 5 = 6 green duraznos more in the basket than red duraznos.
Response:  If there are 10 red duraznos and some green ones more in the basket, then the total number of duraznos is 10 + x, where x is the number of green ones. So, the number of green duraznos is x.
Response:  If there are 3 red durians and some green durians more in the basket, then the total number of durians in the basket is 3 + x, where x is the number of green durians. Since there are 10 more green durians than red durians, we have x = 10. Therefore, the number of green durians in the basket is 3 + 10 = 13.
Response:  We have 7 red duraznos, 15 yellow duraznos and 8 green duraznos in the basket. In total, we have 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 duraznos in the basket. So, there are 30 duraznos in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 8 duraznos verdes in total. The number of red duraznos is given as 7 and the number of yellow duraznos is given as 71. So, we can write an equation: Total number of duraznos = Number of red duraznos + Number of yellow duraznos. Substituting the values, we get: Total number of duraznos = 7 + 71 = 78. Therefore, there are 8 more green duraznos than red duraznos in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 14 duraznos verdes in total and we also know that there are 6 duraznos amarillos in total. So, if we subtract the number of yellow duraznos from the total number of duraznos, we will get the number of green ones. Therefore, the answer is: 14 - 6 = 8. There are 8 more green duraznos than yellow ones in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red durians and 11 yellow durians in the basket. To find out how many more red durians than yellow durians are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of yellow durians from the total number of durians. So, the difference between the number of red durians and yellow durians is:

19 - 11 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more red durians than yellow durians in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red duraznos in the basket and we want to find out how many green ones there are. So let's start counting... There are 90 yellow duraznos in total, so if 6 of them are red (which means they are not yellow), then there are 84 yellow duraznos left. Now, among these 84 yellow duraznos, there are 16 that are green, which means that there are 68 yellow duraznos that are not green. Therefore, there are 6 + 6 = 12 green duraznos in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red duraznos in the basket and we want to find out how many of them there are. So let's start counting from 1 and go up to 18: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Therefore, there are 14 red duraznos in the basket (since there are 18 - 14 = 14). Similarly, we can count the yellow duraznos as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Therefore, there are 14 yellow duraznos in the basket too (since there are 14 - 14 = 0).
"Response:  We know that there are 14 yellow duraznos and 6 green duraznos in the basket. So, we have to find out how many of each type of durazonno are in the basket. To do this, we divide the number of yellow duraznos by 2 (since there are two types of duraznos), and then multiply it by the total number of duraznos:

Number of yellow duraznos = 14 / 2 = 7
Total number of duraznos = 6 + 7 = 13
Therefore, there are 7 green duraznos and 13 yellow duraznos in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 65 cests in total and each cesta has 7 red duraznos and 3 green duraznos. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of red duraznos = 7 x 65 = 455 red duraznos Total number of green duraznos = 3 x 65 = 195 green duraznos Now, let's find out how many duraznos there are in each cesta: Number of duraznos per cesta = Total number of duraznos / Number of cestas = 455 + 195 = 650 duraznos Therefore, there are 650 duraznos in each cesta.
Response:  There are 11 cestas of plums. Each cesta has 10 red plums and 18 green plums. So, in total, there are 10 + 18 = 28 plums per cesta. Therefore, the total number of plums in all the cestas is 28 x 11 = 308 plums.
Response:  There are 6 cestas of plums. Each cesta has 16 red plums and 18 green plums. So, in total, there are 6 x 16 = 96 red plums and 6 x 18 = 108 green plums. Therefore, the total number of red plums is 96, and the total number of green plums is 108.
Response:  There are 7 cestas of plums. Each cesta has 10 red plums and 2 green plums. So, in total, there are 7 x 10 = 70 red plums and 2 green plums. Therefore, there are 70 + 2 = 72 plums in total.
"Response:  If there are 7 duraznos in all the baskets, and each basket has 4 red duraznos and 3 green duraznos, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of red duraznos. Since each basket has 4 red duraznos, and there are 7 duraznos in all the baskets, the number of red duraznos is 7 x 4 = 28.

Step 2: Calculate the number of green duraznos. Since each basket has 3 green duraznos, and there are 7 duraznos in all the baskets, the number of green duraznos is 7 x 3 = 21.

Step 3: Find out how many baskets there are. We know that there are 7 duraznos in all the baskets, so if we divide the total number of duraznos (28 + 21) by 7, we get the number of baskets: 28 + 21 / 7 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 baskets of duraznos."
Response:  There are 2 cestas of plums and each cesta has 4 red plums and some green plums more. So, in total there are 12 plums (4 red + some green). Since each cesta has 4 red plums, then the number of green plums in each cesta is equal to 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 green plums in each cesta.
Response:  If there are 16 duraznos in total and 13 of them are red, then there must be 3 green ones left. So, the number of green duraznos is 3.
Response:  If one cesta has 19 red cherries and 4 green ones, then there are 19 + 4 = 23 cherries in that cesta. Since there are 15 cestas, the total number of cherries is 23 x 15 = 345.
Response:  We have 10 duraznos in total and we want to distribute them equally among some number of canastas. Since each canasta has 4 red duraznos and 6 green duraznos, if we divide 10 duraznos into equal parts, each part will contain 10/x duraznos (where x is the number of canastas). So, there are x canastas of duraznos.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green duraznos in the basket and 2 red duraznos. So, if we add these numbers together, we get: 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 duraznos in total in the basket.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added some more to make it 8 in total. So, Jerry added 4 new action figures to the replica.
Response:  If Jerry had initially 5 figures of action in his room, and then he added 7 more later, that means there are now 12 figures of action in his room (5 + 7 = 12). So, Jerry initially had 5 figures of action in his replica.
Response:  Jerry had 4 figures of action initially and later added 6 more. So, in total, there are 10 figures of action in his stance (4 + 6). Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 figures of action and 9 books in his room. Then he added 7 more figures of action to the shelf. So, now he has 12 (5 + 7) figures of action and 9 books. Therefore, there are 3 more figures of action than books in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 10 books in his room. Then he added 4 action figures to the shelf, so now he has 10 + 4 = 14 items in total. Therefore, there are 14 - 2 (action figures) = 12 books left in Jerry's room. So, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  Jerry had 9 books initially and then added 10 more later, so he has a total of 9 + 10 = 19 books in his stantery.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 figures of action and 2 books in his room. Then he added 4 more books to the shelf, so now he has 7 + 4 = 11 items in total. Among these items, there are still 2 books, which means that the number of figures of action is 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, Jerry had 9 figures of action and 2 books in his room after adding the new ones.
Response:  Jerry had 5 figures of action and 2 books initially. Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, in total, there are now 17 items (books +figures) in Jerry's shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is 17.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 figures of action in his room. Then he added 4 more and took away 5 old ones. So, there are 8 + 4 - 5 = 17 figures of action in Jerry's room.
Response:  If Jerry had initially 3 figures of action in his room and later added 4 more to make it 7, then he must have taken away some of the old ones to get to 6. So, the number of figures of action that Jerry took away from the replica is 3 (the initial amount - the new total). Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 figures of action in his room initially and later added some more to make it 8, then he must have added 1 figure of action to the replica. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had x figures of action in his room. Later, he added 2 more and took away 7 old ones, leaving him with 10 total now. So, we can set up an equation as follows: x + 2 = 10... (1) Now, let's solve for x using substitution method. We know that the value of x is equal to 10 minus the number of original figures Jerry had, which is given as 7. Therefore, we can substitute this value in equation (1): x + 2 = 10 → x = 10 - 7 → x = 3 So, initially Jerry had 3 figures of action in his room.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 9 figures of action in his room initially and then added 7 more later. So, the total number of figures he has now is 9 + 7 = 16. Since we also know that he has 10 books in the shelf, let's subtract the number of books from the total number of figures to find out how many figures are left for the action figures. Therefore, the answer is 16 - 10 = 6 action figures.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the collection. So, in total, Jerry has 5 action figures (3 + 2 = 5). Now, let's check how many action figures are there in comparison to the number of books. There is one book for every three action figures, so if Jerry has 5 action figures, then he must have 16 books (5 x 3 = 16). Therefore, there are 16 books and 5 action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his room. Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, now there are 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Therefore, there were 7 - 3 = 4 more books than action figures in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then some more birds came to join them, making a total of 6 birds in the fence now. So, we can say that 4 more birds came to sit on the fence (i.e., 6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  There were initially 4 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them, making a total of 8 birds now at the fence. So, the number of birds that had been sitting on the fence originally is 4.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 4 pájaros and 46 cigüeñas sitting on the fence. If 6 more birds came to join them, then the total number of birds sitting on the fence is:

Total no. of birds = 4 + 46 + 6 = 56

So, there are 56 birds sitting on the fence in total."
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds (pájaros) and 2 birds (cigüeñas). So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Then, when 5 more pájaros arrived to join them, the total number of birds sitting on the fence becomes 5 + 3 = 8 birds. Therefore, the final answer is 8 pájaros and 2 cigüeñas are sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 pájaros and 4 cigüeñas sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds came to join them, which means that now there are 5 birds in total (including the newcomers). So, the number of pájaros plus the number of cigüeñas sitting on the fence is equal to 5 + 4 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 birds sitting on the fence, including both pájaros and cigüeñas.
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 birds (pájaros) and 6 cigüeñas sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds came to join them, which means that now there are 5 birds (including the original 2 pájaros) plus 6 cigüeñas = 11 birds in total sitting on the fence. So, there are 9 cigüeñas more than pájaros sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 6 cigüeñas (which are also birds). So, in total, we have 4 + 6 = 10 birds sitting on the fence. Then, two more cigüeñas came to join them, making it 10 + 2 = 12 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 12 cigüeñas sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds (pájaros) and 4 cigüeñas sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more cigüeñas arrived to join them. So, in total, we have:

Pájaros = 3
Cigüeñas = 7 (initially + new arrivals)

Therefore, the final number of pájaros and cigüeñas sitting on the fence is:
Pájaros = 3
Cigüeñas = 7"
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 pájaros and 3 cigüeñas sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more cigüeñas came to join them. So, in total, we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds (including both pájaros and cigüeñas) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 3 swans sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more swans came to join them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 4 + 6 = 10 Swans = 3 + 6 = 9 Now, let's check how many swans are sitting on the fence altogether: Total number of swans = Birds + Swans = 10 + 9 = 19 Therefore, there are 19 swans sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 pájaros sentados in the fence. Then, 4 more pájaros came to join them. So, the total number of pájaros now is 6 + 4 = 10. Finally, 8 cigüeñas arrived and joined them. Therefore, the final number of pájaros sitting on the fence is 10 + 8 = 18.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 2 birds sitting on the fence (pájaros). Then, 5 more birds and 4 more cygnets came to join them (pájaros + cigüeñas). So, in total, we have:

Pájaros = 2 + 5 = 7
Cigüeñas = 4

Therefore, there are 7 birds sitting on the fence, including both pájaros and cigüeñas."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds and 6 more cranes came to join them. So, in total, we have:

Initially, there were 3 birds + 2 new birds = 5 birds sitting on the fence.
Now, let's add the number of cranes that came to join them:
5 birds + 6 cranes = 11 birds sitting on the fence.
Therefore, there are 11 birds (including both birds and cranes) sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 cigüeñas and 3 pájaros (total = 8). Then, 4 more pájaros came to join them (total = 12). So, in total, we have 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 cigüeñas and 2 pájaros (total = 8). Then, 3 more pájaros came to join them (total = 10). So, in total, there are now 6 + 2 = 8 cigüeñas and 3 + 2 = 5 pájaros sitting on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 cigüeñas and 5 pájaros.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more cranes and 2 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have:

Initially, 3 birds + (6 cranes + 2 birds) = 3 + 8 = 11 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages long and the second chapter has 11 pages long. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total pages of the first chapter = 48 Total pages of the second chapter = 11 Now, we need to find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter. We can do this by subtracting the total number of pages of the second chapter from the total number of pages of the first chapter: Number of more pages in the first chapter = Total pages of the first chapter - Total pages of the second chapter = 48 - 11 = 37 Therefore, there are 37 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages long, so it takes x pages to complete the second chapter. Since the second chapter is longer than the first one, we can say that x + 80 = 127 (total number of pages in both chapters). Therefore, the difference between the two chapters is 80 - x = 47 pages. So, the second chapter has 47 more pages than the first chapter.
Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Pages in First Chapter + Number of Pages in Second Chapter. Now, according to the question, the first chapter contains 60 pages, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Total Number of Pages = 60 + x Where x is the number of pages in the second chapter. We are also given that the total number of pages in the book is 93, so we can use this value to solve for x: 60 + x = 93 Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us: x = 33 So, the second chapter contains 33 pages.
Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has pages, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Chapter 1 has 67 pages, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - x Where x is the number of pages in Chapter 2 Now, we know that Chapter 2 has 36 pages, so we can plug this value into our equation: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 31 pages Therefore, Chapter 1 has 31 pages.
"Response:  The book has 3 chapters, each with a different number of pages: Chapter 1 - 66 pages; Chapter 2 - 35 pages; and Chapter 3 - 24 pages. To find out how many pages the book has in total, we can add up all these numbers: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. So, the book has 125 pages in total."
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages + the second chapter has 23 pages = 114 pages. So, the first chapter has 91 pages more than the second chapter. Therefore, the answer is 91 pages.
Response:  The total number of pages in the book is given as 3 + 18 + 3 = 64 pages. So, we can see that the second chapter has 18 pages more than the third chapter. Therefore, the answer is 18 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages + 75 pages = 128 pages. Now we subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the total number of pages in the first chapter to find out how many more pages are there in the first chapter than in the third chapter. So, 128 - 21 = 107 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 107 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages long. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages. Therefore, the book has 1931 pages in total.
Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in total and each chapter has pages, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of pages = Number of pages in first chapter + Number of pages in second chapter. Now, according to the question, the first chapter has 10 pages, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Total number of pages = 10 + (Number of pages in second chapter) We know that the second chapter has 23 pages, so we can now solve for the number of pages in the first chapter: Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in second chapter Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pages in first chapter = 23 - 23 = 0 pages In other words, the first chapter has no pages. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 pages.
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter has x pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 2x. Since the second chapter has 68 pages, we can write: 2x = 68. Solving for x, we get: x = 34. So there are 34 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that 62 campers went rowing in the morning and 39 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 62 - 39 = 23. Now, let's find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon: More in the morning = 23 - 39 = -16. Therefore, there were 16 fewer campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 52 campers went for a morning rowing session and 61 campers went for an afternoon rowing session. To find out how many more campers went for the afternoon session than for the morning session, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for the morning session from the number of campers who went for the afternoon session: 61 - 52 = 9. Therefore, 9 more campers went for the afternoon session than for the morning session.
"Response:  We know that 15 campers went for rowing in the morning and some more campers went in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning + Afternoon = Total Number of Campers who went Rowing That Day. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Morning + Afternoon = 32 (Total number of campers who went rowing) Substituting the value of ""Morning"" from the question: Morning + Afternoon = 15 + Some More (value not given) Now we have two equations: Equation 1: 15 + Some More = 32 Equation 2: Some More = 32 - 15 Now we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find out the value of ""Some More"". Solving Equation 1 for ""Some More"": Some More = 32 - 15 = 17 Solving Equation 2 for ""Some More"": Some More = 32 - 15 = 17 Therefore, there were 17 campers who went rowing in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that some campers went rowing in the morning and 7 more went in the afternoon. So, if we add up all the numbers of campers who went rowing during both times, we will get the total number of campers who went rowing that day. Therefore, the answer is: 
Morning + Afternoon = Total Number of Campers Who Went Rowing That Day."
Response:  We know that 36 campers went rowing in the morning, 13 campers went rowing in the afternoon, and 49 campers went rowing at night. So, we can write an equation: Total = Morning + Afternoon + Night. Now let's substitute each value for the corresponding variable: Total = 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 Campers. Therefore, there were 108 campers who went rowing in total.
"Response:  We know that 44 campers went rowing in the morning and 39 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, we have:
Morning - 44 = Evening (morning + afternoon) - 39
Now, we are told that 31 campers went rowing at night. Therefore, we can write:
Evening (morning + afternoon) - 39 = Night - 31
Solving for ""Night"", we get:
Night = Morning + Afternoon + 31
So, there were more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon. The answer is:
More campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon by 7 (31 - 39)."
Response:  We know that 53 people went to row in the morning and 48 people went to row in the afternoon. So, there are more people who went to row in the morning than in the evening. Therefore, the number of people who went to row in the morning is greater than the number of people who went to row in the night. The difference between these two numbers is 53 - 48 = 5. So, 5 more people went to row in the morning than in the night.
Response:  We know that 33 campers went rowing in the morning and 34 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, there are more people who went rowing in the afternoon than those who went rowing at night because only 10 campers went rowing at night. Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon and those who went rowing at night is 34 - 10 = 24.
"Response:  We know that 13 campers went to rowing in the morning and 59 campers went for hiking. In addition, 21 campers went to rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write down the information as follows:
Rowing (morning): 13 + 21 = 34
Hiking (morning): 59
Total number of campers who went to rowing: 34
Therefore, the answer is 34."
Response:  We know that 29 campers went to rowing in the morning and 66 campers went for hiking. So, the total number of campers who went for activities in the morning is 29 + 66 = 95. Now, we are told that 26 campers went for rowing in the afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who went for rowing in the morning and those who went for it in the afternoon is 26 - (95 - 29) = 26 - 67 = -41. So, there were more campers who went for rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 41 campers went to rowing in the morning and 26 campers went to rowing in the afternoon. So, the number of campers who went to rowing is: 41 + 26 = 67. Now, we need to find out how many campers went for hiking. According to the question, 4 campers went for hiking in the morning and none went for hiking in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of campers who went for hiking is: 4. So, the total number of campers who went to rowing or hiking is: 67 (rowing) + 4 (hiking) = 71.
"Response:  We know that 43 campers went for a row in the morning and some more campers went for a row in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of campers who went for a row = Morning + Afternoon. 
Now, let's find out how many campers went for a row in the morning and in the afternoon separately: Number of campers who went for a row in the morning = 43. Number of campers who went for a row in the afternoon =? (We are given that some campers went for a row in the afternoon) To find out how many campers went for a row in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for a row in the morning from the total number of campers who went for a row: Total number of campers who went for a row = Morning + Afternoon Total number of campers who went for a row = 43 +? (From the question) Substituting the value of 43 into this equation, we get: Total number of campers who went for a row = 43 +? (From the question) Now, we can solve for the value of? :? = Total number of campers who went for a row - 43 Total number of campers who went for a row - 43 =? (From the question) Simplifying this equation, we get:? = 10 (Since there were 10 campers who went for a row in the afternoon) Therefore, 10 campers went for a row in the afternoon."
Response:  If Rachel collected 4 apples from an initial total of 7 apples, then there are now 3 apples left on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples still remaining in the tree.
Response:  Initially, there were 4 manzanas in the tree. Then, Rachel collected some of them and now there are only 2 left. So, we can say that Rachel collected 4 - 2 = 2 manzanas. Therefore, Rachel recogió 2 manzanas.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 7 mature apples from her tree and now there are only 5 left on the tree. Of these 5, 3 are mature and the rest (2) are green. So, the number of green apples on the tree is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 2 mature apples from the tree and now there are 7 apples left in the tree. So, if 6 of them are mature, then the number of immature apples must be equal to the total number of apples minus the number of mature ones. Therefore, the number of mature apples at the beginning was 7 - 6 = 1. 
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 6 mature apples from her tree initially. Now, there are 2 mature apples and 4 green apples left on the tree. So, the total number of apples on the tree initially was 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 3 mature apples from her tree initially. So, the total number of mature apples on the tree at first was 3 + 27 = 30. Therefore, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 7 apples from her tree initially. Then, new apples grew on the tree, so there are now 2 more apples. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree is 6 (the initial amount) + 2 = 8 apples. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  There were initially 2 manzanas in the tree. Then, Rachel picked 4 manzanas from the tree. So, there are now 2 - 4 = 0 manzanas left in the tree. Finally, 3 new manzanas grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of manzanas in the tree is now 0 + 3 = 3 manzanas.
"Response:  We know that Rachel had 52 apple trees and she picked 2 apples from one of them. So, there are now 7 apples left in that tree. To find out how many apples were originally in that tree, we can use the information given in the problem: ""Anow the tree has 7 apples still in it."" If the tree had x apples initially, then after Rachel picked 2 apples, the tree had x - 2 apples remaining. Since there are now 7 apples in the tree, we can set up the equation: x - 2 = 7. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, Rachel's apple tree had 9 apples initially."
Response:  We know that Rachel had 3 apple trees and she collected 8 apples from each tree. So, the number of apples she collected is 3 x 8 = 24 apples. Now, we are told that there are still 9 apples left in all the trees. This means that initially, there were 24 + 9 = 33 apples in all the trees. Therefore, the answer is 33.
Response:  If each tree had 7 manzanas and now they have a total of 29 manzanas left, that means there are 22 manzanas more in the trees (29 - 7 = 22). So, Rachel collected 22 manzanas in total from all her four apple trees.
Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more canaries than Doug initially. So, if Ed has x canaries now and Doug has y canaries, we can write an equation: Ed = 2 + y. Now, we are told that after losing some of his canaries in the park, Doug has x - 3 canaries left. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our original equation to find out how many canaries Doug lost: Ed = 2 + (x - 3) Substituting x = 19 (the number of canaries Ed has now), we get: Ed = 2 + (19 - 3) = Ed = 2 + 16 = 18 So, Doug lost 16 canaries in the park.
Response:  We know that Ed had more canicas than Doug initially. So, if Ed had x canicas and Doug had y canicas, then after Doug lost 11 canicas in the park, Doug would have (y - 11) canicas left. Since Ed did not lose any canicas, he still has x canicas. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: x + (y - 11) = 45. Solving for y, we get y = 34. So, Ed had 34 more canicas than Doug at the time they were together in the park.
Response:  Ed had 6 more canisters than Doug. So, if Ed has 22 canisters, then he must have started with 16 (22 - 6 = 16). Now, Doug lost 7 of his canisters in the park. Therefore, Doug now has 9 canisters left (16 - 7 = 9).
Response:  If Ed had 5 more canicas than Doug, that means Ed had x canicas and Doug had x - 3 canicas. So, if Ed had 27 canicas in total, then Doug had 27 - (x - 3) = 20 canicas initially.
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more canicas than Doug initially. Then, Doug lost 27 of his canicas in the park. So, he has fewer canicas now. On the other hand, Ed found 9 additional canicas. Therefore, if we subtract the number of canicas Doug lost from the number of canicas Ed found, we will get the difference between their current number of canicas. Hence, Ed has $X$ more canicas than Doug currently, where $X = 24 - 27 + 9 = 6$.
Response:  We know that Ed had more canicas than Doug initially. So, let's call the number of canicas Ed had at first x. Then, we know that Ed lost 17 canicas in the park. Therefore, the number of canicas Ed had after losing those in the park is x - 17. Now, we are told that Ed had more canicas than Doug. So, we can say that x > Doug's initial number of canicas (which is 29). Thus, the answer is x = 46.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more canicas than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 8 more canicas now, it means he lost some of his initial canicas in the park. To find out how many canicas Ed lost, we need to subtract the number of canicas he currently has (8) from the number of canicas he initially had (19). Therefore, Ed lost 11 canicas in the park.
Response:  We know that Ed had more canicas than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 30 more canicas than Doug, then Ed had 30 + x canicas and Doug had x canicas, where x is an unknown number. Then, we are told that Ed lost 21 of his canicas in the park. This means that Ed now has 30 + x - 21 = y canicas. Since Doug had x canicas initially, he now has x - 21 = z canicas. Therefore, the difference between Ed's initial amount of canicas and Doug's initial amount of canicas is: y - z = 71 (since Ed had 71 more canicas than Doug initially). So, Ed had 71 more canicas than Doug at the end of the story.
"Response:  If Ed had 12 more canicas than Doug, that means Doug has x canicas initially. So, the total number of canicas Ed and Doug have together is:
Ed = 12 + x = 17
Now, if Ed lost 20 canicas in the park, he has:
Ed = 12 + x - 20 = 5
So, Doug now has:
Doug = x - 5 = 12
Therefore, Doug has 12 canicas now."
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 42 students suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon. Therefore, the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested bacon. So, the answer is (408 - 42) = 366.
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 489 students suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested more bacon than mashed potatoes is 489 - 479 = 10.
Response:  According to the passage, 310 students were asked for their suggestions regarding specific types of food to add to the school menu. Among them, 185 students suggested adding mashed potatoes (puré de papas) while others suggested adding bacon (tocino). So, the number of students who suggested adding tocino is 185 - 185 = 0. Therefore, no student suggested adding tocino.
Response:  According to the passage, out of 288 students who were asked for their suggestions, 264 suggested adding bacon (tocino) while 24 suggested adding mashed potatoes (puré de papas). Therefore, 24 students suggested puré de papas.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 63 more students suggested it than those who suggested adding bacon, then... (1) The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 457 + 63 = 520. (2) Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 457 - 63 = 394.
Response:  If 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes, then... (1) There are 348 students in total. (2) 166 students suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 348 - 166 = 182. So, 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.
Response:  According to the question, out of 324 students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu, 374 students suggested adding bacon and 128 students suggested adding tomatoes. So in total, 374 + 128 = 502 students participated in suggesting new food items.
"Response:  If 257 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 120 students suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is greater than 120. 
So, the answer is (257 - 120) = 137."
Response:  If 144 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 79 students suggested adding tomatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding tomatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes. So, the answer is (144 - 79) = 65.
Response:  If 228 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 337 students suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding tomatoes (23). Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes. So, the answer is 337 - 23 = 314.
"Response:  We know that due to Sophia's decision, she asked students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 options. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we can conclude that:

Total number of students = 450 + 38 = 488 students participated in suggesting new food items."
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes along with bacon, and 351 students suggested adding only bacon to the menu, then we can conclude that... (Give your answer)
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding bacon and 330 suggested adding mashed potatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested adding bacon. So, we can say that 330 - 269 = 61 students suggested adding mashed potatoes more than those who suggested adding bacon.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in total. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we will get the number of girls. Therefore, the number of girls is equal to 569 - 236 = 333.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in total. So, we can write this as an equation: 34 + x = 841 where x is the number of boys. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 34 from both sides of the equation: x = 807. Therefore, there are 807 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in that school.
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys, that means there are 469 boys in the school. So, the total number of students in the school is 697 + 469 = 1166.
Response:  If there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls, then the total number of students in that school is: 635 + (510 - 635) = 745. Therefore, there are 745 children in that school.
"Response:  If there are 868 girls and 307 boys (the rest), then the total number of students in the school is:

868 + 307 = 1175

So, there are 1175 students in that school."
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 boys, then the total number of students is 700 + 142 = 842.
Response:  The original number of girls in the school is 706 + 222 = 928. If 418 more girls joined the school, then the total number of girls in the school now would be 928 + 418 = 1346. So there are 1346 students in the school altogether.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have to find out how many girls are left after adding these new students. To do this, we need to subtract the number of new girls from the initial total number of girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the school right now is: 902 - 44 = 858 girls.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 girls. Now, let's find out how many boys are left in the school. The initial number of boys was 410, so after the arrival of new girls, the total number of boys is: Total number of boys = Initial number of boys - Number of new girls who are boys = 410 - (Number of new girls x Number of boys per girl) = 410 - 465(100/410) = 410 - 465 = 89 boys. Therefore, there are 1097 girls more than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 732 + 682 = 1414 girls Now, let's find out how many boys are left in the school after 8 boys joined. So, total number of boys = Initial number of boys - Number of new boys = 761 - 8 = 753 boys Therefore, there are 1414 girls and 753 boys in the school now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 135 girls and 214 boys in the school. Then, 496 more girls joined the school, so now there are 184 girls (initial + additional) = 184. Similarly, we can find out how many boys joined the school by adding 910 to the initial number of boys, which is 214, so now there are 304 boys (initial + additional). Therefore, there are 304 boys and 184 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in total, so we can write this as follows: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys. Total number of students = 308 + 318 = 626. Therefore, there are 626 alumni in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to add the number of teachers. There are 772 professors in the school, so the total number of people in the school is 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people in that school.
"Response:  If there are 402 girls more than boys in the school, then the number of boys is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of girls. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
= 739 - 402
= 337
Therefore, there are 337 boys in that school."
Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys in the school, and there are 692 girls in total, then the number of boys is equal to 692 - 458 = 234. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. Then, 403 more girls joined the school. So, now the total number of girls is 257 + 403 = 659 girls. Now we need to find out how many more girls than boys are in the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 659 - 362 = 297 girls more than boys. Therefore, there are 297 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Edward now has $2.
"Response:  If Edward had $13 and spent some money, he now has $3. So, we can say that the amount of money he spent is equal to the difference between his initial amount ($13) and his new amount ($3). Therefore, the amount of money Edward spent is:
$13 - $3 = $10
So, Edward spent $10."
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $9. Then he spent $8 more, so now he has $17. So, before spending any money, Edward had $9 - $8 = $1.
Response:  If Edward spent $16 on buying books and each book costs him the same amount of money, then he must have had that much money before spending it. So, his initial amount of money was $16 / 92 = $0.18. Therefore, Edward had $0.18 before spending any money.
Response:  If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books and each book cost him the same amount of money, then he paid $3 for each book. So, the cost of each book is $3.
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $X. He spent $6 on books and $16 on pens. So he has $X - $6 - $16 = $10 left. Therefore, Edward had $10 before spending his money.
"Response:  If Edward spent $4 in buying books and $3 in buying pens (or bolígrafos), then he has $12 left after making these purchases. So, we can write an equation as follows: $4 + $3 = $12. Now, let's solve for the amount that Edward spent on each item separately: $4 + $3 = $12; $4 = $9; $3 = $9. Therefore, Edward spent $9 on books and $9 on pens/bolígrafos."
"Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens (or ""bolígrafos""). So he has $19 left after buying both things. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had left: $19 - $8 = $11. Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens."
Response:  Before he spent his money, Edward had $17. Then, he received $10 from his friend. So now he has $7. Therefore, Edward had $17 before spending any money.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 flexions and David did more than Zachary. So, we can say that David made x flexions. Since David did more than Zachary, we can write an equation as follows: x = 44 + x. Now, we have to find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. Solving for 'x', we get: x = 72. Therefore, Zachary made 44 flexions and David made 72 flexions in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 flexions and David made 44 flexions. To find out how many more flexions Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of flexions David made from the number of flexions Zachary made: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary made 7 more flexions than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 flexions and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if we subtract 9 from 44, we get... (check answer)
Response:  We know that David made 51 flexions in class today and he did 49 more than Zachary. So, Zachary made 51 - 49 = 2 flexions. Therefore, David made 51 + 2 = 53 flexions in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 flexions and 44 abdominales. Then we are told that David did 19 more flexions than Zachary. So, David did 59 + 19 = 78 flexions. Now, we are also told that David did 27 fewer abdominales than Zachary. So, David did 44 - 27 = 17 abdominales. Therefore, David did 78 flexions and 17 abdominales in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 flexions and 17 abdominales in class today. Then we are told that David did 29 more flexions than Zachary but 13 fewer abdominales than Zachary. So if Zachary did x abdominales, then David did x - 13 abdominales. Therefore, David did 50 abdominales (x = 50).
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 flexions and 14 abdominales in class today. David did 17 more flexions than Zachary but 10 less abdominales. So, if we let X be the number of flexions Zachary did, then David did X + 17 = 60 flexions (since he did 17 more than Zachary). And if Y is the number of abdominales Zachary did, then David did Y - 10 = 24 abdominales (since he did 10 less than Zachary). Now we have two equations: X + Y = 53 (Zachary's total) and X + 17 = 60 (David's total). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us X = 39 and Y = 18. Therefore, Zachary did 39 flexions and 18 abdominales in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 flexions and 3 abdominales in class today. Then we are told that David did 58 more flexions than Zachary. So, Zachary did x flexions (since he did 35). Also, David did 87 less abdominales than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary did 3 + x = 58 flexions and 3 + x - 87 = 3 abdominales. Now we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. Solving for x, we get x = 26. So, Zachary did 26 more flexions than David and 3 more abdominales than David.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 flexions and 58 abdominales in class today. So he did more abdominales than flexions. Then we are told that David did 38 flexions more than Zachary but 62 abdominales less than Zachary. This means that if Zachary did x abdominales, then David did (x + 62) abdominales. Now we want to find out how many abdominales more Zachary did than David. So we can set up an equation as follows:
Zachary’s abdominales = David’s abdominales + 62
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Zachary’s abdominales = 58 + 62
Zachary’s abdominales = 120
Therefore, Zachary did 120 abdominales more than David."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 flexions in class today. Then we are told that David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 58 flexions (39 + 19). Finally, we learn from the question that John did 13 fewer flexions than David, so John did 45 flexions (58 - 13). Therefore, David did 58 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 flexions in class today. Then we are told that David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 flexions (51 + 22 = 73). Now, we are also given that John did 4 less than David, so John did 69 flexions (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John did 69 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 flexions in class today and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 54 flexions (39 + 15). Now we are told that John did 9 less than David. Therefore, John did 45 flexions (54 - 9). Finally, we want to know how many more flexions Zachary did than John. To find this, we subtract the number of flexions done by John from the number of flexions done by David: 54 - 45 = 9. So, Zachary did 9 more flexions than John.
Response:  We know that David made 30 more flexions than Zachary. So, if David did 37 flexions, Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 flexions.
Response:  If David made 56 more flexions than Zachary, that means Zachary did x flexions. Since David did 38 flexions, we can write an equation: 56 = x + 38. Solving for x, we get: x = 18. So, Zachary did 18 flexions and David did 38 + 18 = 56 flexions in total.
"Response:  We know that David did 40 more flexions than Zachary and 17 fewer abdominal exercises than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x abdominal exercises, then David did x - 17 abdominal exercises. Since we are told that Zachary did 62 abdominal exercises, we can set up the equation:
x = 62 + 17
Solving for x, we get:
x = 79
So, David did 79 abdominal exercises in class today."
"Response:  According to the question, David did 36 more sit-ups than Zachary, but he also did 33 fewer abdominal crunches than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 58 flexions and 33 abdominal crunches, then Zachary did:
Flexions = 58 - 33 = 25 more flexions than David
Abdominal Crunches = 33 - 33 = 0 abdominal crunches less than David"
Response:  We know that David did 27 more sit-ups than Zachary and 7 less crunches than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x crunches, then David did 27 + x crunches. Also, we know that Zachary did 5 sit-ups and 17 crunches. Therefore, the difference between the number of crunches Zachary did and the number of sit-ups he did is: 17 - 5 = 12. So, Zachary did 12 more crunches than sit-ups.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension, then she has to do 3 more pages of math homework than reading comprehension. So, Rachel needs to do 8 pages of math homework (5 + 3 = 8).

21. Question: A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. How many books can the bookshelf hold in total?
Formula: Total number of books = Number of shelves x Capacity per shelf
Solution: Total number of books = 5 x 8 = 40 books
Therefore, the bookshelf can hold 40 books in total."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and she also had to complete more pages of reading homework for a total of 7 pages, then we can say that...

Step 1: Find out how many pages of reading homework Rachel has to complete if she already completed 5 pages of math homework.

So, let x be the number of pages of reading homework Rachel has to complete. Since Rachel already completed 5 pages of math homework, we know that x + 5 = 7 (total number of pages - number of pages completed in math).

Now, solve for x: x + 5 = 7...(1)

Step 2: Solve equation (1) to find out how many pages of reading homework Rachel has to complete.

Subtract 5 from both sides of equation (1): x = 2 (reading homework pages).

Therefore, Rachel has to complete 2 pages of reading homework."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and she also had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework, then we can write an equation as follows:
Math homework = 7
More math homework than reading homework = 4 + x
Where 'x' is the number of pages of reading homework that Rachel had to complete.
Now, we are given that Rachel completed 4 pages of reading homework in addition to the 7 pages of math homework. So, we can substitute this value into our equation as follows:
Math homework = 7
More math homework than reading homework = 4 + 4 = 8
Therefore, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of reading homework."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and she needed to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, then...
Step 1: Calculate the number of pages of reading homework that Rachel needs to complete. Since Rachel needs to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, we can say that for every page of math homework, Rachel needs to complete 1 + 3 = 4 pages of reading homework. So, if Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework, she needs to complete 8 x 4 = 32 pages of reading homework.
Step 2: Add the number of pages of math homework and reading homework that Rachel needs to complete. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 8 + 32 = 40 pages of homework in total.
Therefore, Rachel has to complete 40 pages of homework in total."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and she also had to complete 6 more pages of reading homework than math homework, then...
Step 1: Find out how many pages of math homework Rachel completed.
8 pages
Step 2: Find out how many pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete.
6 pages - 8 pages = -2 pages (negative because we subtracted from the number of math pages)
So, Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 10 pages of math homework and she also had to complete 3 more pages of reading comprehension than math homework, then...
Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Rachel had to complete in math homework initially.
10 pages x =... (1)
Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Rachel had to complete in reading comprehension.
If she had to complete 3 more pages than her math homework, then...
3 pages =... (2)
Now, we can solve for the value of x in equation (1):
x = 10 pages
Substitute the value of x from equation (1) into equation (2):
3 pages = 7 pages
Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of reading comprehension in total.
So, the final answer is:
Rachel had to complete 7 + 10 = 17 pages of homework in total."
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 2 pages of math homework, that means she has 2 x 4 = 8 pages left for other subjects (lecture and biology). So in total, Rachel has to complete 8 + 3 = 11 pages of work.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. To find out how many more pages she had to do in math, we can subtract the number of pages she had to do in reading from the total number of pages she had to do in math. So, if she had to do 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension, then she had to do 9 - 2 = 7 additional pages of math homework. Therefore, Rachel had to make 7 more pages of math homework than she did of reading comprehension.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension, that means she had 9 pages left for other subjects. Since she also had to complete 3 more pages of biology homework, we can deduce that she had 6 pages left for other subjects (mathematics included). Therefore, Rachel had 6 + 9 = 15 pages of total homework remaining.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she needed to complete 11 + 7 = 18 pages of homework in total. Now, we are asked how many more pages of biology homework she had to complete than reading comprehension homework. So, if she had to complete 8 additional pages of biology homework, then she would need to complete (8) pages more than 18 pages of homework in total. Therefore, the answer is 18 + 8 = 26 pages of homework in total.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she had to complete a total of 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework in these subjects. However, the question also states that she had to complete 29 additional pages of work in biology. So, in addition to the 20 pages of homework in math and reading, Rachel had to complete an additional 29 pages of work in biology, for a total of 49 pages of homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension. Additionally, she had to complete 3 more pages of biology homework. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework that Rachel had to complete is: 8 + 7 + 3 = 18 pages. So, Rachel had to complete 18 pages of homework in total.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 10 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she had to complete 15 pages of homework in total. Additionally, she had to complete 6 more pages of biology homework, which brings the total number of pages of homework that Rachel had to complete to 21 pages. So, the answer is 21 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of math problems. To find out how many more pages she needed to do in math, we can subtract the number of pages she had to do in reading from the total number of pages she had to do in math. So, if she had to do 4 pages of math problems, and she did 2 pages of reading, then she needs to do 6 more pages of math problems (4 - 2 = 6). Therefore, Rachel needed to complete an additional 6 pages of math problems.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension, 7 pages of math problems, and 19 additional pages of biology work. To find out how many more pages she had to do in math, we can subtract the number of pages she had to do in biology from the total number of pages she had to do. So, if she had to do 19 + 7 = 26 pages of work in math. Therefore, Rachel had to do an additional 26 pages of math homework.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 8 emails (6 + 2 = 8). Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Morning emails = 6
Afternoon emails = 8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 5 emails in the day. This means that he received x emails in the afternoon, where x is the difference between 5 (total number of emails) and 4 (number of emails received in the morning). Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails at night. Therefore, he received a total of 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails in one day. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 5 + 8 = 13 emails. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the afternoon and 8 emails at night. So, he received a total of 13 emails. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, then he received a total of 11 emails (3 + 8). So, Jack received 11 emails in total.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 7 emails in the afternoon, and 17 emails at night. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning + Afternoon = Night (emails received). Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: 10 + 7 = 17 (emails received at night) Substituting this value back into our original equation gives us: 10 + 7 = 17 (emails received at night) Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning and afternoon combined.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 emails in the afternoon and 7 emails at night. So, he received a total of 9 + 10 + 7 = 26 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than he did at night.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails during the daytime. Now, we are asked how many more emails he received in the evening than at night. To find this difference, we can subtract the number of emails he received at night from the total number of emails he received during the daytime: 15 - 4 = 11. Therefore, Jack received 11 more emails in the evening than he did at night.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening (not specified how many). So, he received a total of 6 + x emails during the day, where x is the number of emails he received in the evening. Since we are told that he received some more emails in the evening, this means that x > 0. Therefore, Jack received 6 + x = 10 emails in total during the day. Now, since 3 is the number of emails he received in the afternoon, we can conclude that x - 3 = 7 is the number of emails he received in the evening. So, Jack received 7 emails in the evening.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So, in total, he received 3 + 64 = 67 messages. Then, in the afternoon, he received 5 emails and 54 letters. Therefore, in total, Jack received 67 + 5 = 72 messages during the day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 5 + 6 = 11 messages in the morning. Then we are told that he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 + 7 = 16 messages in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received a total of 11 + 16 = 27 messages in one day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters, so he received a total of 22 messages (emails + letters). Later in the day, he received 3 emails and 44 letters, for a total of 47 messages (emails + letters) that he received after lunch. Therefore, Jack received 5 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters, so he received a total of 14 messages (6 + 8 = 14). Then in the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 9 messages (2 + 7 = 9). Therefore, Jack received 5 more messages in the morning than in the afternoon (14 - 9 = 5).
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters. So, he received 91 - 6 = 85 emails in the morning. Then, in the afternoon, he received 2 emails and sent 74 letters. Therefore, he received 2 + 85 = 87 emails in total that day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack sent 2 letters and received 4 emails. So, he sent 2 - 4 = -2 emails in the morning. Then, in the afternoon, Jack sent 8 letters and received 6 emails. So, he sent 8 - 6 = 2 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack sent a total of 2 emails in the day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 9 emails in total during the day. If he received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then we can assume that he received x emails in the afternoon. Since there are 12 hours in a day (morning + afternoon), we can write an equation as follows: Total emails = Morning emails + Afternoon emails. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total emails = 7 + x. Solving for x, we find that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 8 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). Now we are asked how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon. To find this difference, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning: 8 - 3 = 5. So, Jack received 5 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, for a total of 9 emails during the day. Therefore, he received 9 - 3 = 6 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that the length of the jump made by the frog (La Rana) is 12 inches and the length of the jump made by the lobster (La Langosta) is 9 inches. To find out how much more the frog jumped than the lobster, we need to subtract the length of the lobster's jump from the length of the frog's jump. So, the answer is: 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches more than the lobster.
Response:  The total distance that both the lobster and frog jumped is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. So, in this case, it would be 31 + 35 = 66 inches or 5 feet 6 inches (approximately). Therefore, they together salted 5 feet 6 inches.
Response:  We know that the rana (frog) jumped x more than the langosta (crab). So, we can write an equation as follows: Rana = Langosta + X. Now, we are also given that the rana jumped 17 pulgadas más que la langosta, which means that Rana = Langosta + 17. Substituting this value in our first equation, we get: Langosta + 17 = Rana. Simplifying and solving for Langosta, we find that she jumped 24 pulgadas. Therefore, the rana jumped 17 + 24 = 41 pulgadas.
"Response:  We know that the langosta jumped 25 inches (pulgadas). The frog jumped x inches more than the crab and the mouse jumped 2 inches more than the frog. So, we can write an equation:
x + 25 = 30
Solving for x, we get:
x = 25 - 2 = 23
So, the mouse jumped 23 inches."
Response:  We know that the raton salted x more than the langosta. So we can write an equation as follows: Ratón = Langosta + X. Now we are given that the langosta salted 19 pulgadas and the rato...
"Response:  We know that the rana (frog) jumped x more than the langosta (crab). So, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 19 = 39
Now, we know that the ratón (mouse) jumped 94 less than the rana. So, we can write another equation as follows:
x - 94 = 39
Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x?"
Response:  We know that the raton salted x pulgadas less than the rana. So we can write an equation as follows: Ratón = Rana - X. Now we are given that the rana salted 32 pulgadas more than the langosta, so we can add this to our equation: Ratón = Rana - X + 32. Finally, we are told that the langosta salted 25 pulgadas, so we can substitute this value in our equation: Ratón = Rana - X + 32 - 25. Simplifying and solving for X, we get: Ratón = 17 pulgadas. Therefore, the ratón salted 17 pulgadas.
"Response:  We know that the raton salted x less than the langosta. So we can write an equation as follows: Ratón = Langosta - x. Now we are given that the langosta salted 24 pulgadas and the rato...

Please provide more details or clarify your question so I can help you better."
"Response:  We know that the lobster jumped 13 inches and the frog jumped x inches less than the lobster. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Lobster distance = 13 inches
Frog distance = Lobster distance - (x inches)
Now, we are given that the frog jumped 2 inches less than the lobster. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the above equation to get:
Frog distance = 13 inches - 2 inches
= 11 inches
So, the frog jumped 11 inches."
Response:  We know that the lobster jumped 35 inches and the frog jumped x inches less than the lobster. So, we can write an equation as follows: 35 = x + 4. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 31 = x. Therefore, the frog jumped 31 inches in total.
"Response:  We know that the length of the jump made by the lobster is 19 inches (or 48 cm). The statement says that the l...

Question:  La langosta, la rana y el ratón tuvieron una competencia de saltos. La langosta saltó 19 pulgadas. La langosta saltó 4 pulgadas más lejos que la rana y el ratón saltó 44 pulgadas menos que la rana. ¿Qué tan lejos saltó la rana?

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step. We know that the length of the jump made by the lobster is 19 inches (or 48 cm). The statement says that the lobster salted 4 inches more than the frog and the mouse together. So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.

We also know that the total distance traveled by all three animals together is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + (x - 44) = 19

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 63

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that:

x = 31

So, the frog jumped 31 inches (or 79 cm), and the mouse jumped 31 - 44 = -13 inches (or -33 cm)."
Response:  We know that the length of the jump made by the frog (rana) is x. Since the raton salted 12 pulgadas less than the frog, the distance traveled by the raton is x - 12 = 39 pulgadas. So, the distance traveled by the raton is 39 pulgadas.
Response:  We know that the length of the jump made by the frog (rana) is 25 pulgadas more than the length of the jump made by the mouse (raton). So, if the mouse jumps x pulgadas, then the frog jumps x + 25 pulgadas. Now we are told that the langosta jumped 21 pulgadas. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Langosta = Mouse + Frog. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Langosta = 21 + x - 25. Simplifying and solving for x, we find that the mouse jumped 46 pulgadas. Thus, the langosta jumped 21 pulgadas more than the mouse.
Response:  We know that the rana (frog) jumped 39 inches and the langosta (crab) jumped 17 inches. To find out how much more the frog jumped than the crab, we can subtract their distances from each other: 39 - 17 = 22 inches. So, the frog jumped 22 inches more than the crab.
Response:  We know that the rana (frog) jumped 33 pulgadas more than the langosta (lobster). So, if the lobster jumped x pulgadas, then the frog jumped x + 33 pulgadas. Now we are told that the raton (mouse) jumped 3 pulgadas less than the rana. So, the mouse jumped x - 3 = 26 pulgadas. Therefore, the distance the raton (mouse) jumped is 26 pulgadas.
Response:  We know that the raton salted x more than the langosta. So we can write an equation as follows: Ratón = Langosta + X. Now we are given that the langosta salted 14 pulgadas and the raton salted x more than the langosta. Therefore, we can substitute these values in the equation to get: Ratón = Langosta + X. Substituting the values, we get: Ratón = 14 + X. Now we are asked to find out how much more did the raton jump than the langosta. To do this, we need to solve for X. Solving for X, we get: X = 20. Therefore, the raton jumped 20 pulgadas more than the langosta.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tazas of harina and she needs to add more. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total amount of harina needed = 14 - 5 = 9 tazas

Now, we know that the recipe requires 6 tazas of azúcar for every 10 tazas of harina used. Therefore, we can calculate the number of tazas of azúcar needed as follows:

Number of tazas of azúcar needed = 6 x (9/10) = 5.4 tazas

So, Mary needs to add 5.4 tazas of azúcar more than the amount of harina she has already added."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazas of harina and she needs to add 5 more tazas (since the recipe requires 9 - 4 = 5 tazas of harina). Now, we need to find out how many tazas of azúcar are left to be added. Since the recipe requires 11 tazas of azúcar and Mary has already added 7 tazas (since 11 - 4 = 7), then she needs to add 4 more tazas of azúcar (since 4 is the remaining amount). Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 tazas of azúcar more than tazas of harina.
Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of harina and still needs 8 more tazas, then she must have added less than 8 tazas so far. So, we can say that Mary has added x tazas of harina. Now, if she needs 8 more tazas, it means that she needs to add another x + 8 tazas of harina. Therefore, Mary needs to add (x + 8) tazas of harina more.
Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of harina and still needs 2 more tazas, then she must have added at least 3 tazas (since she needs 2 more). So, the number of tazas of harina that Mary has added is 3.
Response:  The recipe requires 11 tazas of sugar and some more tazas of flour. Mary has already added 3 tazas of flour. So, to find out how many tazas of flour are left to add, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total required: 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, the recipe requires 8 more tazas of flour.
"Response:  If Mary needs 2 more tazas of harina and the recipe requires 12 tazas in total, then she has already put x tazas of harina. Since there are 17 tazas (12 + 5) in total, we can set up the equation:
x + 2 = 17
Now solve for x:
x = 15
So, Mary has put 15 tazas of harina so far."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 tazas of harina and 62 tazas of azúcar. To find out how many more tazas of harina she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of harina she has already added from the total amount required (9 tazas). So, Mary needs to add 6 tazas of harina more.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tazas of azúcar and the recipe requires 14 tazas in total. So, we need to find out how many more tazas of azúcar does she need to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount (14 - 2 = 12) by the amount she has already added (2). This means she needs to add 6 more tazas of azúcar. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 tazas.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tazas of harina and the recipe requires 12 tazas in total. So, we need to find out how many more tazas of harina she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount (12 - 11 = 1) by the amount she has already added (11). This means she needs to add 1 more taza of harina. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 taza.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 tazas of harina and she needs to add more. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total amount of harina needed = 10 tazas - 7 tazas
= 3 tazas

Now, let's find out how many tazas of azúcar are required:

Total amount of azúcar needed = 2 tazas + (3 tazas / 4)
= 2 tazas + 0.75 tazas
= 2.75 tazas

So, Mary needs to add 2.75 tazas of azúcar more than the amount of harina she has already added."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tazas of harina and she needs to add more. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total amount of harina needed = 12 tazas - 2 tazas (already added)
= 10 tazas

Now, let's find out how many tazas of salt are needed:

Total amount of salt needed = 7 tazas

So, we need to add 3 tazas of salt (since there are 10 tazas of harina left to be added). Therefore, the final answer is:

Mary needs to add 3 tazas of salt."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tazas of harina and she needs to add more of both sugar and salt. So, we can start by finding out how much more of each ingredient she needs to add.
Let's calculate the amount of each ingredient needed based on the original recipe:
Harina: 6 tazas - 5 tazas = 1 taza
Azúcar: 8 tazas - 5 tazas = 3 tazas
Sal: 7 tazas - 5 tazas = 2 tazas
Now, let's find out how many tazas of each ingredient Mary needs to add now:
Harina: 1 taza + (6 - 5) = 1 + 1 = 2 tazas
Azúcar: 3 tazas + (8 - 5) = 3 + 3 = 6 tazas
Sal: 2 tazas + (7 - 5) = 2 + 2 = 4 tazas
Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 tazas of harina, 6 tazas of sugar, and 4 tazas of salt to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 13 - 2 = 11 more tazas of sugar. So, she needs to add 11 more tazas of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazas of sugar to her recipe and she needs 6 more tazas of sugar. So, we need to find out how many tazas of flour are left in the recipe after adding 4 tazas of sugar. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (6) by the amount of sugar Mary has already added (4). This gives us 1.5 tazas of flour remaining in the recipe. Since each taza of flour is equal to 8 tazas of harina, we can convert 1.5 tazas of flour into 12 tazas of harina (since there are 8 tazas of harina per taza of flour). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 12 - 4 = 8 tazas of harina to complete her recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tazas of harina to the mixture and she needs to add 7 more tazas (since there are 9 tazas of harina required in total). So, we need to subtract the amount of harina she has already added from the total amount needed, which gives us 7 tazas of harina left to be added. Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more tazas of harina to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tazas of harina (which is half of the total amount required). So, we need to find out how much more harina she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of harina needed by 2:

Remaining amount = Total amount - Amount already added
= 14 tazas - 11 tazas
= 3 tazas

Now, we know that for every 3 tazas of harina, Mary needs 1 taza of azúcar. Since Mary has already added 11 tazas of harina, she needs 3 + 1 = 4 tazas of azúcar more. Therefore, the answer is 4 tazas of azúcar more than tazas of harina."
Response:  If Mary needs 5 more tazas of harina than she has already put in, and the recipe requires 10 tazas of harina, then... (10 - 5 =) 5 tazas of harina have been used so far. So, Mary has put 5 tazas of harina into the mixture.
Response:  If Mary needs to use 13 tazas of flour and she has already put some flour (let's say x), then she still needs to use 13 - x tazas of flour. So, if x = 4, then Mary has put 4 tazas of flour so far.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 tazas of harina and 60 tazas of azúcar to the recipe. To find out how many more tazas of harina she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of harina she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. So, the number of tazas of harina needed is:

Total amount of harina required = 14 tazas
Amount of harina already added = 7 tazas
Number of tazas of harina needed = Total amount of harina required - Amount of harina already added
= 14 tazas - 7 tazas
= 7 tazas
Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more tazas of harina to the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tazas of azúcar and 12 tazas of harina to the recipe. To find out how many more tazas of azúcar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe: 11 tazas - 10 tazas = 1 taza. So, Mary needs to add one more taza of azúcar to the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 tazas of harina to the mixture and the recipe requires 10 tazas of harina in total. So, we need to find out how many more tazas of harina she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of harina required (10 - 6 = 4) by the amount of harina she has already added (6). This means that Mary needs to add an additional 4 tazas of harina to the mixture.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazas of harina and she needs to add more. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Tazas de harina = Total tazas de harina - Tazas de harina ya añadidas
= 14 - 4
= 10

Now, let's check how much sugar is needed:

Tazas de azúcar = Total tazas de azúcar / (Total tazas de harina / 2)
= 9 / (14 / 2)
= 9 / 7
= 1.286

So, Mary needs to add approximately 1.3 tazas of harina for every taza of sugar required."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tazas of harina and she needs to add 6 more tazas (since there are 7 tazas required - 2 tazas already added = 6 tazas left). So, Mary needs to add 6 more tazas of harina.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 tazas of harina to the recipe and she needs to add more azúcar and sal. So we can start with the total amount of ingredients that Mary has already added: 12 tazas of harina + 11 tazas of azúcar = 23 tazas of ingredients so far. Now, we need to find out how many tazas of each ingredient are required in the original recipe: 11 tazas of azúcar, 6 tazas of harina, and 9 tazas of sal. Since Mary has already added 12 tazas of harina, she still needs to add 4 tazas of harina (6 - 12 = 4). Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 tazas of azúcar (11 - 4 = 7) and 9 tazas of sal (9 - 0 = 9) to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazas of sugar to the recipe and we need to find out how many more she needs to add. So, let's subtract the amount she has already added from the total required amount of sugar. Total required amount = 7 - 4 = 3 tazas of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 tazas of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tazas of sugar to the recipe and she needs to add more. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Sugar = Total amount of sugar - Amount already added (10)
Harina = Total amount of flour - Amount already added (flour)

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:
Total amount of sugar = 12 tazas
Amount already added = 10 tazas
So, we have:
Sugar = 12 - 10 = 2 tazas

Similarly, we can find out how many tazas of flour Mary needs to add:
Flour = Total amount of flour - Amount already added (flour)
= 14 - 0 = 14 tazas

Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 tazas of flour (14 - 7 = 7)."
Response:  If there are currently 19 families of birds living near the mountain and 60 families of birds flew away for winter, then the number of families that stayed behind is 19 - 60 = -41. So, the number of families of birds that flew away for winter is 60 + 41 = 101.
"Response:  We know that 7 families of birds flew away for winter and there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain. So, we can write an equation as follows:

7 + x = 87 (where x is the number of families of birds that stayed behind)
Now, we need to solve this equation to find out how many families of birds stayed behind. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 87 - 7
x = 80
So, there are 80 families of birds that stayed behind near the mountain."
Response:  We know that there were initially 20 families of birds near the mountain who flew south for winter. Then we are told that out of these 20 families, 14 stayed behind in the mountain region. So, the number of families of birds who lived nearby and remained in the mountain region is 14. Therefore, the total number of families of birds who lived nearby the mountain at the beginning was 20 + 14 = 34 families.
Response:  We know that there are 85 families of birds living near the mountain. Then we are told that 23 families of birds flew towards Africa and 37 families of birds flew towards Asia. So, the total number of families of birds that did not fly away is: 85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25 families. Therefore, there are 25 families of birds left near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to different places according to the season. So, if 42 families of birds flew towards Africa and 31 families of birds flew towards Asia, then we can say that:
Number of bird families that flew towards Africa = 42 - 31 = 11
Therefore, more bird families flew towards Africa than those who flew towards Asia."
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain and they all want to migrate to warmer countries. If 47 families of birds flew towards Africa, then we can say that 38 - 47 = 9 families of birds did not fly towards Africa. Similarly, if 94 families of birds flew towards Asia, then we can say that 9 + 94 = 103 families of birds flew towards Asia more than those who flew towards Africa. Therefore, the number of families of birds that flew towards Asia is 103.
Response:  We know that there are 18 families of birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer countries for winter. Then we learn that 38 families of birds flew towards Africa and 80 families of birds flew towards Asia. So, in total, 38 + 80 = 118 families of birds migrated away from the mountain for winter. Therefore, the number of families of birds remaining at the mountain is 18 - 118 = -100 families. 
"Response:  The original number of families of birds living near the mountain is 87. If we add 18 new families of birds, then the total number of families of birds living near the mountain becomes:
87 + 18 = 105
Therefore, there are 105 families of birds living near the mountain now."
Response:  We know that there are 49 families of birds living near the mountain and 24 new families of birds came from the Arctic to live nearby. So, in total, there are 73 families of birds living near the mountain (49 + 24).
"Response:  We know that initially there were 41 families of birds living near the mountain. Now, we are told that 27 families of birds flew away to spend the winter in warmer countries. So, the number of families of birds left near the mountain is:

Number of families of birds left = Initial number of families - Number of families that migrated
= 41 - 27
= 14
Therefore, there are 14 families of birds left near the mountain after 27 families migrated for the winter."
Response:  We know that initially there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain and now 86 families have flown away for winter. So, the number of families of birds remaining near the mountain is: 45 - 86 = 41 families. Therefore, 35 more families of birds flew away to go to warmer countries than those who remained behind.
Response:  We know that there are 41 families of birds living near the mountain and they all want to migrate to warmer countries. If 35 families of birds flew towards Asia, then we have 41 - 35 = 6 families left in our original location. Now, if 62 families of birds flew towards Africa, then we have 6 + 62 = 68 families of birds flying towards Africa. So, the number of families of birds that flew towards Africa is greater than the number that flew towards Asia by 68 - 35 = 33 more families.
"Response:  We know that there are already three families of birds living near the mountain. Then, we learn that 26 new families of birds have arrived from the Arctic to live nearby. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is:

3 + 26 = 29

Therefore, there are 29 bird families living near the mountain."
Response:  We know that Paul received 253 crayons for his birthday and lost or gave away 70 of them during the year. So, at the end of the school year, he had 183 crayons left (253 - 70 = 183).
"Response:  We know that Paul received x crayons in his birthday box. At the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons, leaving him with 177. So we can write an equation:
x - 551 = 177
Now let's solve for x:
x = 177 + 551
x = 728
Therefore, Paul received 728 crayons in his birthday box."
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 crayons for his birthday and gave away 111 to his friends during the school year. So, he had 440 - 111 = 329 crayons left. Then we are told that he lost 106 crayons, so he has 329 - 106 = 223 crayons left. Therefore, Paul has 223 crayons left.
Response:  We know that Paul received a box of 65 crayons for his birthday and gave away 213 crayons to his friends during the school year. So, in total, he has given away 213 - 65 = 148 crayons. However, we are also told that he lost 16 crayons. Therefore, the final number of crayons that Paul has is 148 - 16 = 132 crayons.
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 crayons for his birthday and gave away 571 to his friends during the school year. This means he has 18 crayons left (589 - 571 = 18). Now we are told that he lost 161 crayons. So, the number of crayons he gave away is greater than the number he lost. Therefore, the difference between the number of crayons he gave away and the number he lost is equal to the number of crayons he had at the beginning. In other words, the answer is 18 + 161 = 179.
Response:  If Paul received 110 crayons for his birthday and gave away 90 to his friends, then he has 21 left (110 - 90 = 21). Now, we are told that he lost 412 crayons during the school year. So, if he had 21 crayons left after giving some away, and he lost 412 more, then he must have started with 623 crayons in total (21 + 412 = 633). Therefore, he lost 412 more crayons than he gave away to his friends. 
Response:  If Paul received 563 crayons and gave them away during the school year while losing 558 crayons, then he had 563 - 558 = 105 crayons left. Now, if only 332 crayons remained after he gave them away, then he must have received 332 / 105 = 3.14 (approximately) crayons in his birthday gift. So, the answer is approximately 314 crayons.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 52 crayons as gifts during the school year and lost or gave away 535 crayons. So, if he only has 492 crayons left, we can subtract the number of crayons he got from his initial amount to find out how many he lost or gave away:

52 (crayons given) + 492 = 544

Now, let's subtract the number of crayons he lost or gave away from the total number of crayons he had at first:

544 - 535 = 9

So, Paul lost or gave away 9 crayons during the school year."
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 521 crayons and 66 sketches. If he didn't lose or give away any of them during the year, then he must have used some of them to make drawings. So, we can say that the number of crayons he used is equal to the difference between the initial amount (521) and the remaining amount after the year (154). Therefore, the number of crayons that were used = 521 - 154 = 367. Now, let's see how many sketches he made using those crayons. Since there are 66 sketches initially, and he only has 154 left after the year, it means that he must have drawn 66 x 367 = 24,980 sketches during the year!
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 531 crayons and 38 borrowed ones. So he had in total 569 (531 + 38) crayons. Then we are told that at the end of the year, he only lost 391 crayons without losing any of his borrowed ones. Therefore, the number of crayons left with him is equal to the initial amount minus the number he lost during the year, which is 569 - 391 = 178 crayons. So, there were 178 more crayons than borrowed ones left with Paul at the end of the year.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers (borradores). So he started with 601 + 406 = 1007 items in total. Then, during the year, some of these items were used or lost, but we don't know how many exactly. However, we do know that at the end of the year, there were only 336 left. This means that the number of items left after losing some is equal to 336 - 1007 = -671. Since we can't have negative numbers of crayons or erasers, it must be that all the erasers were used up and none of the crayons were lost. Therefore, the number of erasers Paul had left at the end of the year was 406, and the number of crayons he had left was 601 - 406 = 195.
Response:  We know that Paul received a total of 315 crayons at some point during the year. At the end of the year, he had only 291 left. So, we can deduce that he lost or gave away 24 crayons (315 - 291 = 24). Therefore, Paul received 24 crayons in his birthday gift.
Response:  We know that Paul received a total of 267 crayons for his birthday and lost 231 during the school year. So he had 267 - 231 = 136 crayons left. Now we are told that he gave away 308 crayons to his friends. So he has 136 - 308 = -172 crayons left. Since it can't be negative, there were 172 more crayons given away than lost. Therefore, the answer is 172.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 457 borrowed notebooks and 320 colored pencils. If he didn't lose any during the school year, then he must have received 133 more notebooks (since he started with 457) and used all 320 colored pencils. Therefore, he has 457 + 133 = 590 notebooks left at the end of the year. Now, we need to find out how many colored pencils he has left. Since he started with 320 and didn't use any, he still has 320 colored pencils. So, in total, Paul has 590 notebooks and 320 colored pencils, which means he has 810 items left at the end of the year.
Response:  At first, the bartender had 11 customers. If some left and he still had 3 customers, then the number of customers who left is equal to the number of customers he still has. So, the answer is 8 (11 - 3).
Response:  The camerero had 3 clients initially and then some left, so he had 4 clients remaining. To find out how many more clients stayed than those who left, we need to subtract the number of clients who left from the total number of clients the camerero had at first. So, the answer is: 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, 2 more clients stayed than those who left.
Response:  The camerero had some clients at first (let's call it x). After 9 of them left, he still had 12 clients (x - 9 = 12). So, initially, the camerero had x clients. Therefore, the answer is x = 18.
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""Un camarero tenía 14 clientes."" So initially, there were 14 clients. Now, we are asked about the number of clients after 5 have left. Therefore, the total number of clients that remained = 14 - 5 = 9."
Response:  The cameraman had 13 customers at first and then gained 4 new ones, so he now has 13 + 4 = 17 customers. If some of them left, he still has 9 customers. So, the number of clients who went away is equal to 9 - 17 = -8 clients.
Response:  The cameraman had 12 customers initially and then lost 15 customers. So he has 12 - 15 = -3 customers left. Then, he gained 14 new customers, so he now has 3 + 14 = 17 customers. Therefore, the number of customers the bartender has today is 17.
Response:  The camerero had 3 clients initially and then he got 5 more customers (8 - 3 = 5). So, new customers who arrived are 5.
Response:  The cameraman had 8 clients initially and then some left, leaving him with 5 clients. Then, 99 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers he now has is 5 + 99 = 104. Therefore, none of his original 8 clients went away because they were replaced by the new ones that came in.
Response:  The camarero had 12 clients initially and then some left, so he had 14 clients after that. Then, he obtained 10 new clients, so now he has... (12 + 14) + 10 = 36 clients.
Response:  If Dan had initialy $x dollars and spent $2 on a bar of caramel, then he has $x - $2 left. Since he has $3 left, we can set up the equation x - $2 = $3. Solving for x, we get x = $5. So, Dan initially had $5 dollars.
"Response:  We know that Dan had $4 initially and after buying a bar of caramel he was left with $3. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
$4 - $3 = x (where x is the cost of the bar of caramel) 
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $4: 
$1 = x / $4 
Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $4 to get rid of the fraction: 
x = $4 (This means that the bar of caramel cost $4.)"
Response:  If Dan bought 99 bars of candy for $3 each, he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. So, he has $4 - $297 = -$293 left. Therefore, the correct answer is -$293.
Response:  We know that Dan spent all of his money ($3) to buy two bars of candy. So, each bar must have cost half of the amount he had: $\$ \frac{3}{2} = \$1.50$. Therefore, each bar of candy cost $\$1.50$.
Response:  We know that Dan spent $6 x number of bars = $6 x 4 = $24. So he bought 4 bars of candy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $2 to buy the bar of caramel, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he bought another item (chocolate) for $3, which means he now has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, Dan has $2 in total after buying both items.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is equal to the cost of the barra de caramelo plus the cost of the chocolate. So we can write an equation as follows: $7 + $6 = x, where x represents the total amount of money that Dan spent. Now, we know that Dan had $4 at first and he spent all of it, so we can say that x = $4. Therefore, Dan spent a total of $10 (=$7 + $6) to buy the barra de caramelo and the chocolate.
Response:  The cost of the bar of caramel is $6 and the cost of the chocolate is $3. So, in total, Dan spent $6 + $3 = $9 on candy. Therefore, he spent twice as much money on the bar of caramel than he did on the chocolate.
Response:  The cost of the chocolate is $3 and the cost of the bar of caramel is $2. So, in total, Dan spent $3 + $2 = $5 on both items together. Therefore, he spent twice as much money on the chocolate than on the bar of caramel.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $8 for buying a bar of caramel. So he has $4 - $8 =-$4 left. Then his friend gave him $5. So now he has $-4 + $5 = $1 left. Therefore, Dan has $1 left after buying the caramel and receiving money from his friend.
Response:  If Dan had $4 at first and spent all of it on the bar of caramel, then he must have paid $4 for the bar of caramel. So, the cost of the bar of caramel is $4.
Response:  Dan spent a total of $3 on 10 bars of candy. That means he spent $3 / 10 = $0.30 per bar. Since each bar costs $0.30, Dan has $4 - ($0.30 x 10) = $4 - $3 = $1 left over. So, Dan has $1 left after buying the candy.
Response:  We know that Dan spent a total of $4 and he bought 2 bars of candy. So, the cost of each bar is: Cost = Total amount spent / Number of items purchased Cost = $4 / 2 = $2 per bar. Therefore, each bar of candy cost $2.
Response:  The cost of the chocolate is $3 and the cost of the bar of caramels is $7. So, in total, Dan spent $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent twice as much money on the bar of caramels than he did on the chocolate.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is given as $4 + $7 + $2 = $13. So he spent more money on buying the chocolate than on buying the bar of candy. In other words, the ratio of the cost of the chocolate to the cost of the candy is $13 / $2 = 6.5. Therefore, Dan spent approximately 6.5 times more money on buying the chocolate than on buying the bar of candy.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them in the garage sale. So, the number of books left with him is:

115 - 78 = 37

Therefore, Paul has 37 books left after the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books, he had 105 left. So, if we subtract the number of books sold from the total number of books he had at first, we get...

$$ \therefore Total Books = 105 - 137 = 32 $$

So, Paul initially had $32$ books."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after selling some in a garage sale he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:

108 - Number of books sold = 62

Now, we need to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by the number of books he sold:

Number of books sold = 108 / (108 - 62)
= 108 / 46
= 2.39

So, Paul sold 239 books at the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and after buying some at a garage sale, he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of books Paul had = 50
Number of books Paul bought =?

We are given that Paul now has 151 books, so we can set up another equation:

Total number of books = Number of books Paul had + Number of books Paul bought
= 50 + x
where x is the number of books Paul bought.
Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:

50 + x = 151

Solving for x, we get:
x = 101

So, Paul bought 101 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 2 books and then sold some at his garage sale to raise funds for buying new books. So, he had fewer books after selling them. Now, he has 58 books, which means he bought 150 - 2 = 148 new books. Therefore, he sold 2 - 148 = -146 books. Since negative numbers indicate the number of books he purchased rather than sold, we can conclude that Paul did not sell any books.
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had 21 books and after selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones, so now he has 15 books left. To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we need to subtract the number of books he bought from the initial number of books he had: 
21 - 42 = -21
So, Paul sold -21 books more than he bought."
Response:  If Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale, he must have had fewer than 71 books left after the sale. Let's assume that he sold half of his original 71 books, which is 35.5 books (since you can't sell a fraction of a book). So now he has 35.5 - 35 = 0.5 books left. Then, he bought 38 new books, so now he has 0.5 + 38 = 42.5 books. Finally, if he has 116 books now, then he must have bought 73.5 books more than he sold (116 - 42.5 = 73.5). Therefore, the answer is 73.5.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. If he sold some of them in the garage sale, we can deduce that he has fewer items now. So, let's write an equation:

Number of books = 66 (books left after the sale)
Number of pens = 59 (pens left after the sale)

Now, we need to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we will divide the number of books he had initially by the number of books he has left after the sale:

Number of books sold = Initial number of books / Number of books left after the sale
= 108 / 66
= 1.63

So, Paul sold 1.63 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 106 bolígrafos and after selling some in the garage sale he was left with 14 bolígrafos. So, to find out how many bolígrafos he sold at the garage sale we can subtract the number of bolígrafos he had after the sale from the initial amount. Therefore, the answer is 106 - 14 = 92 bolígrafos.
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had 136 books and after selling some of them he was left with 27 books. So, we can write an equation:

136 - x = 27
Where 'x' is the number of books sold by Paul.
Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 136:

x / 136 = 27 / 136
x = 27 / 136
x = 0.20 (or 20%)
So, Paul sold 20% of his initial collection of books, which means he sold 20 out of every 100 books."
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Now we are told that he sold some of these books in a garage sale and ended up with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is equal to 68 - 95 = -27 books. In other words, he did not sell any books at all!
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 bolígrafos and 153 books. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 bolígrafos left. To find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can divide the number of books he started with (153) by the number of books he had left after the sale (13). So, Paul sold 153 - 13 = 140 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 bolígrafos and 143 books. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 bolígrafos left. To find out how many bolígrafos he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of bolígrafos he had after the sale from the initial amount: 42 - 19 = 23. So, Paul sold 23 bolígrafos at the garage sale.
Response:  There were initially 10 rosas in the vase. Then, Jessica cut 8 more roses from her garden and put them in the vase. So, now there are... (10 + 8) = 18 roses in the vase!
Response:  If there were some roses in the vase initially (let's say x), then after Jessica cut 16 more from her garden and put them in the vase, there are now x + 16 roses in the vase. So, the total number of roses in the vase is 23. Therefore, the initial number of roses in the vase was x = 9.
Response:  There were initially 2 rosas in the vase. Then, Jessica pulled out 4 rosas from the vase and cut some new roses from her garden to add to the vase. So, there are now 23 rosas in the vase. To find out how many rosas Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of rosas that were already in the vase (2) from the total number of rosas now in the vase (23). Therefore, Jessica cut 21 rosas.
Response:  If there were originally 15 rosas in the vase and Jessica took out 33 rosas, then there are now 0 rosas left in the vase (since she took all of them). So, if she cut some new roses from her garden to put in the vase, that would be an additional amount x. Therefore, the total number of rosas in the vase is 0 + x = 17. So, the answer is x = 7.
Response:  If there were originally 21 rosas in the vase and Jessica took out 34 from it, then there are now 21 - 34 = -13 rosas left in the vase. Since she also cut some new roses from her garden to put in the vase, let's say she cut x new roses. Then, the total number of rosas in the vase is -13 + x = 15. So, the answer is x = 6 (new roses she cut from her garden).
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 rosas in the vase and then Jessica cut some more from her garden which had a total of 59 roses. So, if she cut x number of roses, then the total number of roses in the vase after cutting would be 7 + x. Since there are now 20 rosas in the vase, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 20. Solving for x gives us x = 13. Therefore, Jessica cut 13 roses from her garden.
"Response:  If there were initially 13 rosas in the vase and Jessica cut some more from her garden that had 12 roses, then the total number of roses she brought to the vase is:

13 + (12 - 13) = 25

So, there are 25 roses in the vase now. Since Jessica only took some from her garden, there must be still some roses left in the garden, which is equal to the original number of roses in the garden minus the number of roses taken for the vase:

12 - 25 = -13

Therefore, there are -13 roses left in Jessica's garden."
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 rosas and 62 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, then now there are 17 rosas and 96 orquídeas in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of rosas (15) from the new total number of rosas (17). Therefore, Jessica cut 2 rosas.
Response:  There were initially 12 rosas and 2 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, Jessica must have cut 2 orquídeas from the vase.
Response:  There were initially 5 rosas and 3 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, then there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So, the number of rose is 7 (12 - 5) more than the number of orchids. Therefore, there are 7 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  There were initially 7 rosas and 12 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. So, the number of orchids in the vase increased by 8 (20 - 12). Therefore, there are 8 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If initially there were 3 rosas in the vase and now there are 19, then Jessica must have cut (or added) 16 roses to or from the vase. Therefore, she cut 16 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 rosas and 84 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, then now there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of rosas before (13) from the new total number of roses (14). Therefore, Jessica cut 13 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. So, now there are 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of orchids before (3) from the number of orchids after (7). Therefore, Jessica cut 4 orchids.
Response:  There were initially 6 rosas and 20 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, then there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, there are 5 more roses than orchids in the vase (22 - 21 = 5). Therefore, there are 5 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  There were initially 9 rosas and 6 orquídeas in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. So, there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of roses from the total number of orchids: 13 - 3 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  We know that Robin's hair measured 17 inches before she cut some off. If now it measures 13 inches, then we can say that she cut off x number of inches. Since there are 12 inches in one foot, and since 17 - x = 13, we can set up the equation: 12x = 49. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, Robin cut off 8 inches of her hair.
Response:  Before cutting his hair, Robin had 20 inches of hair (20 pulgadas). Now he has 10 inches (10 pulgadas) less than that amount. So, before cutting his hair, Robin had 30 inches (30 pulgadas) of hair.
Response:  At first, Robin's hair measured 16 inches (pulgadas). Then it was cut to 11 inches (pulgadas), so its length decreased by 5 inches (pulgadas). After that, his hair grew back to 12 inches (pulgadas), which is an increase of 1 inch (pulgada) from its original length. Therefore, Robin's hair currently measures 12 + 1 = 13 inches (pulgadas).
"Response:  If Robin's hair was initially 19 inches long, and it grew an additional 18 inches, then its current length is:

19 + 18 = 37 inches
Therefore, Robin's hair currently measures 37 inches in length."
Response:  If Robin cut off 13 inches of her hair and initially it measured 14 inches, then... (1) The length of Robin's hair after cutting is equal to the initial length minus the amount she cut off. So,... (2) Length of Robin's hair now = Initial length - Cut-off length = 14 - 13 = 1 inch. Therefore, Robin's hair measures 1 inch now.
Response:  At first, Robin's hair measured 14 inches (pulgadas). Then it grew another 8 inches, so now it measures 22 inches (pulgadas). Finally, he cut off 20 inches of his hair, leaving him with 2 inches (pulgadas) left. So, to find out how much his hair measures now, we subtract the amount he cut from the original length: 22 - 2 = 20 inches (pulgadas). Therefore, Robin's hair currently measures 20 inches long.
Response:  Danny had 12 tapas of bottles in his collection initially. Then he found 53 more tapas of bottles in the park. So, now he has 12 + 53 = 65 tapas of bottles.
Response:  If Danny already has 21 tapas of bottles in his collection and he found some more in the park, then he must have found x tapas of bottles in the park. Since he now has 53 tapas of bottles in total, we can write an equation as follows: 21 + x = 53. Can you solve for x?
Response:  We know that Danny found 63 new bottle caps in the park and he already had 51 old ones, so together they have 114 bottle caps. Now, Danny collected 33 more bottle caps, which means he has 147 bottle caps in total. Therefore, Danny had 147 bottle caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 tapas of bottles in the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 new tapas of bottles now. To find out how many more tapas he found than he threw away, we can subtract the number of tapas he threw away from the total number of tapas he found: 22 - 35 = -13. Therefore, Danny found 13 more tapas of bottles in the park than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 tapas of bottles in the park and threw away 63 old ones, so he gained 30 - 63 = -33 tapas of bottles. Now, we are told that he has 42 tapas of bottles in his collection, which means that he must have thrown away more than the number of tapas he found in the park. Therefore, the answer is positive infinity (∞).
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 tapas of bottles in the park and added them to his collection. Then he found 8 more envelopes in the park, which he also added to his collection. So, at this point, Danny had 22 + 8 = 30 tapas of bottles and 8 + 63 = 71 envelopes in his collection. Therefore, Danny had 30 tapas of bottles at first.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 22 tapas of bottles and 30 envelopes in the park. Then he found more envelopes and added them to his collection, so he now has 17 tapas of bottles and 57 envelopes. To find out how many envelopes Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of envelopes he already had (30) from the total number of envelopes he found (57): 57 - 30 = 27. So, Danny had 27 envelopes at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 tapas of bottles and 14 envelopes in the park initially. So, he had 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection initially. Now, we are told that he has 7 more tapas of bottles and 86 more envelopes in his collection now. Therefore, the total number of tapas of bottles he found in the park is 7 + 30 = 37, and the total number of envelopes he found is 86. So, Danny found 37 tapas of bottles more than envelopes in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 tapas of bottles and 28 envelopes in the park initially. So, his initial collection was 11 + 28 = 39. Now, he found additional 68 tapas of bottles and 51 envelopes, so his new total collection is 39 + 68 = 107. Therefore, Danny found 51 more envelopes than bottles in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 71 tapas of bottles and 24 envelopes in the park. Then he found more tapas of bottles (28) and envelopes (16). So, now he has 28 tapas of bottles + 16 envelopes = 44 items in his collection. Therefore, Danny has 44 - 24 = 20 more tapas of bottles than envelopes.
Response:  We know that initially Danny had 10 tapas of bottles and 62 envelopes in the park. So he collected 27 more tapes of bottles which means he has 27 + 10 = 37 tapas of bottles now. Similarly, he collected 43 envelopes which is equal to the number of envelopes he already had i.e., 62. Therefore, Danny now has 37 tapas of bottles and 62 envelopes in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 tapas of bottles in the park and now he has 25 tapas of bottles in his collection. So, if he had x tapas of bottles at first, then after losing 66 tapas, he had x - 66 tapas. Now, he has 25 tapas, so we can set up the equation: x - 66 = 25. Solving for x, we get: x = 92. Therefore, Danny had 92 tapas of bottles at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny had 25 tapas de botellas in his collection before he found some more in the park. So, if he found x new tapas of bottles in the park, then he has 32 - 25 = 7 more tapas of bottles than he did before. Therefore, the number of tapas of bottles he found in the park is 7.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 old bottle caps in the park and found 58 new ones. So he has a total of 60 + 58 = 118 bottle caps now. But then it says he already had 67 bottle caps in his collection before. So, we can deduce that Danny had 67 - 118 = -51 bottle caps at first. Therefore, the answer is -51.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 6 old bottle caps in the park and found 50 new ones. So he has a total of 6 + 50 = 56 bottle caps now. Therefore, the number of bottle caps more than those he threw away is 56 - 6 = 50.
Response:  If Danny collected 54 old bottle caps in the park and found 48 new ones, then he has a total of 102 bottle caps now (54 + 48 = 102). So, he must have thrown away 50 bottle caps (102 - 52 = 50) more than he found. Therefore, the answer is 50.
Response:  At first, Danny had 82 envoltorios and 0 tapas of bottles in his collection. Then he found 29 more tapas of bottles in the park. So, now he has 82 + 29 = 111 envoltorios and 42 tapas of bottles. Therefore, initially Danny had 42 tapas of bottles.
Response:  We know that Danny found 66 envelopes and 39 bottle caps in the park initially. So, he had 66 + 39 = 105 envelopes and bottle caps at first. Then, he collected some more items from the park, which resulted in him having 16 bottle caps and 68 envelopes now. Therefore, Danny had 105 - 16 = 89 envelopes and bottle caps initially.
Response:  We know that Danny had 46 envelopes and 50 bottle caps before he went to the park. So, in total, he had 46 + 50 = 96 items. Then, after collecting more items from the park, he now has 21 bottle caps and 52 envelopes. Therefore, the difference between the number of bottle caps and envelopes is: 21 - 52 = -31. So, Danny found -31 bottle caps fewer than envelopes in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 envelopes and 5 bottle caps in the park initially. Then he collected 31 more bottle caps and 9 fewer envelopes. So, the number of envelopes Danny found in the park is 65 - 9 = 56. Therefore, Danny found 56 more envelopes than bottle caps in the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 58 tapas of bottles and 25 envelopes in the park. Then he found more tapas of bottles and envelopes, so his collection increased to 11 envelopes and 12 tapas of bottles. To find out how many more tapas of bottles than envelopes Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of envelopes from the number of tapas of bottles: 12 - 11 = 1. So, Danny has one more tapa of bottle than envelope now.
"Response:  We know that Danny had 15 tapas of bottles and 18 envelopes in the park initially. So he collected 67 more envelopes and 35 more bottle caps. Therefore, Danny now has 67 + 35 = 102 more envelopes than bottle caps. 
So, Danny has 18 (initial) + 102 = 120 envelopes now."
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 less than Steven, so if Jake has 17 duraznos, then Steven must have 28 duraznos (17 - 11 = 6).
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 less than Steven, so if Steven has x duraznos, then Jake has x - 7 duraznos. Additionally, we know that Steven has 14 more than Jill, so if Jill has y duraznos, then Steven has y + 14 duraznos. Finally, we are told that Steven has 15 duraznos, so we can set up the equation:
x - 7 = y + 15
Solving for Jake's number of duraznos, we get:
Jake has 9 duraznos."
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 less than Steven, so Steven has 18 + 13 = 31 more than Jake. And we also know that Steven has 19 duraznos in total. So, if Jake has x duraznos, then Jill has x - 18 = 23 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less than Steven, so Jake has 5 + 3 = 8 melons. Now we know that Steven has 8 more than Jill, so Steven has 8 + X = 15 melons (where X is the number of melons Jill has). Finally, we are told that Steven has 5 melons, so Jill must have X - 5 = 10 melons. Therefore, Jake has 8 more melons than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 less than Steven, so Jake has x duraznos. Since Steven has 11 more than Jill, Steven has x + 11 duraznos. And since Steven has 4 duraznos, we can write an equation: x + 11 = 4. Solving for x, we get x = -7. So Jill has 7 more duraznos than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 less than Steven and 9 more than Jill. So, if Steven has 16 duraznos, then Jake has... (do calculations)

Solution: To find out how many duraznos Jake has, we need to subtract 7 from the number of duraznos Steven has and then add 9.

Jake has 16 - 7 + 9 = 12 duraznos."
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 less than Steven and 8 more than Jill. So, if Steven has 17 duraznos, then Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 duraznos. And if Jill has 8 more than Jake, then she has 10 + 8 = 18 duraznos. Therefore, Jill has 18 duraznos.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 less than Steven and 18 more than Jill. So, if we write it in an equation, we have:
Steven = Jake - 9 + 18 (Jill)
Now, we are told that Steven has 16 duraznos. So, substituting this value into our equation, we get:
16 = Jake - 9 + 18 (Jill)
Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
7 = 18 (Jill)
Therefore, Steven has 7 more duraznos than Jill."
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 less than Steven, so Steven has 6 + 6 = 12 more than Jake. Then we know that Steven has 18 more than Jill, so Jill has -18 (since Jill is fewer than Steven). Now we can calculate how many duraznos Jake has: Jake has 6 less than Steven, plus Jill has -18, so Jake has 6 + (-18) = 10 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 5 less than Steven, so Steven has 5 + 8 = 13 more than Jake. Then we are told that Steven has 18 more than Jill, so Jill has 18 - 13 = 5 fewer than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 5 fewer than Jill, which means he has 5 + 5 = 10 fewer than Jill. So Jake has 87 - 10 = 77 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 less than Steven, so Steven has 16 + 1 = 17 more than Jake. Then we are told that Steven has 15 more than Jill. So Jill has 15 - 1 = 14 fewer than Jake. Therefore, Jill has 14 more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 less duraznos than Steven and he also has 79 more manzanas than Steven. So, if Steven has x duraznos of duraznos, then Jake will have x - 12 duraznos of duraznos. Additionally, since Jake has 79 more manzanas than Steven, Jake will have x + 79 manzanas. Now we can substitute these values in the equation to solve for x: x = 19 + (x - 12) = 14 + 79. Solving for x, we get x = 58. Therefore, Jake has 58 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 less duraznos than Steven and 3 more manzanas than Steven. So, if Steven has x manzanas, then Jake has 13 - x manzanas. Also, we know that Steven has 9 duraznos, so Jake must have 9 + 3 = 12 duraznos. Therefore, Jake has 12 manzanas.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 less duraznos than Steven and 8 more manzanas than Steven. So, if we write it in an equation, we have: Duraznos = 17 - 6 + 8 =? Manzanas = 16 + 8 =? To solve for the first part of the equation, we can subtract 6 from 17 to get 11. Therefore, Jake has 11 duraznos more than Steven. Now, let's move on to the second part of the equation. Since Jake has 8 more manzanas than Steven, we can add 8 to 16 to get 24. So, the number of manzanas that Steven has is 24. In conclusion, Steven has 3 more duraznos than manzanas.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less melons than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x melons and y apples, then Jake has 3less than x = 3x - 3 and 10 more than y = 10y + 10. Now we are given that Steven has 12 melons and 15 apples, so we can substitute these values in the equations to find out how many more apples than melons Steven has. Solving for y, we get y = 15 - 3(12) = 15 - 36 = -21. Therefore, Steven has 21 more apples than melons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 duraznos and Jake has 4 less than Steven. So, Jake has 8 duraznos (12 - 4 = 8). Now we are told that Jill has 67 more duraznos than Steven. Therefore, Jill has 67 + 12 = 79 duraznos. Finally, we are asked how many duraznos Jake has. Since Jake has 8 duraznos and Jill has 79 duraznos, Jake must have 79 - 8 = 71 duraznos. So, Jake has 71 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 duraznos and Jake has 12 less than Steven, so Jake has 6 duraznos. Then we are told that Steven has 8 more than Jill, which means that Jill has 8 - 8 = 0 duraznos (since she doesn't have any). So Jill has no duraznos.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 duraznos and Jake has 12 less than Steven, so Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 duraznos. Additionally, we are told that Jake has 72 more than Jill, which means he has 72 + 7 = 89 duraznos in total. Therefore, Jake has 89 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 duraznos and Jake has 6 less than Steven, so Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 duraznos. Additionally, we are told that Jake has 3 more duraznos than Jill, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 duraznos. Therefore, Jill has 11 duraznos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer duraznos than Steven. So, if Steven has x duraznos, then Jake has x + 84 duraznos. Also, we know that Steven has 13 duraznos. Therefore, Jake has (x + 84) - 13 =? duraznos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more manzanas than Steven and 17 less duraznos than Steven. So, if Steven has x duraznos and x manzanas, then Jake has 13 + x = 17 + x manzanas. Since Steven has 8 duraznos, we can set up the equation: 8 = x - 13. Solving for x, we get x = 5. Therefore, Jake has 17 + 5 = 22 manzanas.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 less duraznos than Steven and 10 more manzanas than Steven. So, if we write it in an equation, we have: Duraznos = 8 - X Manzanas = 10 + X Where X is the number of manzanas that Steven has. Now, we are told that Steven has 11 manzanas. So, plugging this value into the equation, we get: Duraznos = 8 - 11 Manzanas = 3 Which means that Steven has 3 more duraznos than manzanas. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less duraznos than Steven and 4 more manzanas than Steven. So, if we write it in an equation...
Jake = Steven - 3 + 4...(1)
Now let's find out how many manzanas Steven has. According to the question, Steven has 19 manzanas. So, we can substitute this value into equation (1)...
Jake = 19 + 4 - 3...(2)
Now simplify the equation...
Jake = 26
So, Steven has 26 manzanas more than duraznos."
"Response:  If there were $78 in Oliva's wallet and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then...
Step-by-step calculation:
$78 - $15 = $63
So, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet."
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she has $33 left, that means she had $78 - $33 = $45 initially. So, Olivia had $45 initially.
"Response: 
Olivia had $100 in her wallet and received an additional $148 from an ATM. So she now has $248. Then, after visiting a grocery store, she spent $159. Therefore, the amount she spent is $159."
"Response:  We know that there were $3$ dollars in Oliva's wallet initially and she received $49$ more from an ATM. After visiting the supermarket, she had $49$ dollars left. So, we can write this as:
$$3 + 49 = x$$
Where $x$ is the amount of money she spent at the supermarket. Since she didn't spend all of it ($49$), we can say that:
$$3 + 49 < x$$
Now we have two inequalities:
$$3 + 49 = x \leq x$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = 72$$
So, Olivia spent $72$ dollars at the supermarket."
Response:  We know that there were $53 in Oliva's wallet initially and she received $91 more from an ATM. So, her new amount of money is $53 + $91 = $144. Then, after visiting the supermarket, she had $144 - $14 = $130 left. Therefore, the amount of money she spent at the supermarket was $130 - $91 = $39 more than what she collected from the ATM.
Response:  We know that there were initially $106 in Oliva's wallet and after visiting the supermarket she had $75 left (since she spent $49 at the exhibition). So, she spent $31 at the supermarket.
"Response:  If Olivia had $54 in her wallet initially and spent some amount of money after that, then she will have $29 left. So, we can write an equation as follows:

$54 - x = $29
Where 'x' represents the amount spent by Olivia.
Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $54:

$1 = x / $54
Now, multiply both sides of the equation by $54 to get rid of the fraction:

x = $54
So, Olivia spent exactly $54 dollars."
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she has $90 left after spending money ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications in his phone initially and he eliminated 5 of them. So, the number of applications left in his phone is: 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 applications remaining in Dave's phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had x applications in his phone. After deleting 18 of them, he was left with y applications (where y > x). So, we can write an equation as follows: x + 18 = y. Now, we are told that after deleting these applications, he was left with 5 applications. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation and solve for x: x + 18 = 5 → x = 3. So, Dave initially had 3 applications in his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones. So, his total number of applications was 10 + 11 = 21. Now, he eliminated some applications, leaving him with 4. Therefore, we can conclude that Dave eliminated 21 - 4 = 17 applications.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications in his phone initially and then he added 89 new ones. So, the total number of applications in his phone after adding the new ones is: 21 + 89 = 106. Now, we are asked how many applications he eliminated. The answer is given as 24. Therefore, the difference between the number of applications he added and the number of applications he eliminated is: 106 - 24 = 82. So, Dave added 82 more applications than he eliminated.
Response:  Dave had 15 applications in his phone initially and added 71 new ones, so he has a total of 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). Then, after deleting some, he was left with 14 applications. So, the number of applications that he deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of applications and the final number of applications, which is 86 - 14 = 72. Therefore, Dave deleted 72 applications from the ones he added.
"Response:  We know that initially Dave had 16 applications and 77 files in his phone. After removing some apps and files, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. To find out how many apps Dave removed, we can divide the number of remaining apps (5) by the initial number of apps (16):

Number of apps removed = Number of remaining apps / Initial number of apps
= 5/16
= 0.3125
So, Dave removed 3 apps from his phone."
"Response:  After Dave had 17 applications and 21 files in his phone, he eliminated some of them. So, after this process, he had 3 applications left. Now, let's count how many files were left. We know that there are 7 files remaining because it says ""After eliminating some of them, he had 3 applications and 7 files."" Therefore, Dave eliminated 14 files (21 - 7 = 14)."
"Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files in his phone. After removing some apps and files, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files. So, the number of applications more than files that Dave has in his phone is:

$$ \boxed{21 - 4 = 17} $$
Therefore, there are $ 17$ more applications than files in Dave's phone."
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 applications and 18 files in his phone. After removing some apps and files, he was left with 6 apps and 15 files. So, the number of files more than apps is 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 additional files in Dave's phone after removing some apps.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications in his phone and then added some more, he now has 18 applications. So, he must have added 1 application. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that initially Dave had 15 applications and 59 files in his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. To find out how many apps Dave deleted, we can divide the number of apps he started with (15) by the number of apps he ended up with (12). So, Dave deleted 3 apps.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and applications initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 17 applications and 21 files. To find out how many files were deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the initial number of files: 21 - 24 = -3. So, Dave deleted 3 files.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files in his phone. After removing some apps and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, the number of applications more than files is 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 more applications than files in Dave's phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 applications and 3 files in his phone. After removing some apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 apps. So, the number of files more than apps is 24 - 2 = 22 files.
Response:  If Nell had 242 baseball cards and she gave 136 to Jeff, then she has 106 cards left (242 - 136 = 106).
Response:  We know that Nell had 301 baseball cards initially and she gave 301 to Jeff. So, now she has 154 - 301 = -147 cards left. But we can't have negative number of cards, so actually Nell had 301 cards initially.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of cards (528) and her current number of cards (252), which is 276. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she now has 535 cards left. Since Jeff already had 234 cards, he gained 109 new cards (535 - 234 = 109). Therefore, Jeff now has 343 baseball cards (234 + 109 = 343).
"Response: 
Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 number 10 cards initially.
She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so she now has 415 baseball cards and 149 number 10 cards.
To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than number 10 cards, we need to subtract the number of number 10 cards from the total number of cards she has:
415 - 149 = 266
So, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than number 10 cards."
"Response:  
Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 number cards initially. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so she now has 404 baseball cards. Since she also gave some of her number cards to Jeff, she now has 495 number cards. So, the difference between the number of number cards she had initially (214) and the number of number cards she has now (495) is equal to the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff minus the number of number cards she gave to him. That is, 214 - 49 = 165. Therefore, Nell has 165 more number cards than she did initially."
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving some to John, she had 210 cards left. So, if she gave some more to Jeff, then she must have given him fewer than 210 cards. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is less than or equal to 210 - 210 = 0. Hence, Nell did not give any cards to Jeff.
"Response:  
Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So now she has 55 ten-card sets (since each set contains 10 cards) plus her remaining 178 baseball cards. 
So, the total number of cards Nell has is:  
55 + 178 = 233
Therefore, Nell has 233 more baseball cards than ten-card sets."
"Response: 
Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So now she has 376 ten-card sets and 111 baseball cards left.
We know that Nell collected more ten-card sets than baseball cards, so we can say that the number of ten-card sets she has is greater than the number of baseball cards she has.
Let's call the number of ten-card sets she has x. Since she has 376 ten-card sets, we can write an equation:
x > 111
Now let's solve for x:
x = 376 - 111
x = 265
So, Nell has 265 ten-card sets more than she has baseball cards."
Response:  If Paco had x galletas at first and he ate 19 of them, then he has x - 19 galletas left. So, if we want to find out how many galletas he had at first, we can set up an equation as follows: x = 35 - (x - 19). Solving for x, we get: x = 46. Therefore, Paco had 46 galletas at first.
Response:  We know that Paco had 28 galleta initially and after eating some of them he was left with 7. So, we can write an equation as follows: 28 - x = 7 where x is the number of galletas that Paco ate. Now, we need to solve for x using subtraction. 28 - x = 7 x = 21 Therefore, Paco ate 21 galletas.
"Response:  Paco had initially 40 galleta... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. Paco had initially 40 galletaes, and he ate 2 of them, so he has 40 - 2 = 38 galletaes left. Then, he bought 37 additional galletaes, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 galletaes in total. Therefore, Paco has 75 galletaes left."
Response:  First, Paco had 25 galleta...
Response:  Paco had 13 galleta initially and he eat 2 of them, so now he has 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he bought 36 more galleta, so now he has 11 + 36 = 47 total galleta.
Response:  Paco had 40 galletaes initially and he eat 5 of them so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 left. Then he gave 13 to his friend, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 remaining. Therefore, Paco has 22 galletas left.
Response:  Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them, so now he has 17 - 14 = 3 left. Then, he gave 13 to his friend, so now he is left with 3 - 13 = -10 cookies. So, Paco ate more cookies than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and ate 16 of them, so he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. Then, he gave his friend 21 cookies, which is more than the number of cookies he had (-4), so he gave his friend 21 + (-4) = 17 cookies. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 17 more cookies than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 22 sweets and 75 salty ones. So he had a total of 97 candies (22 + 75). Then, he ate 15 sweet candies, so he has left 22 - 15 = 7 sweet candies. Now, he ate 54 salty candies, so he has left 75 - 54 = 21 salty candies. Therefore, Paco has 7 sweet candies left.
Response:  At first, Paco had 9 + 6 = 15 galletas (dulces and salty). Then he ate 36 - 3 = 33 dulce gallettes. So, he left with 15 - 3 = 12 galletas salty. Therefore, Paco has 12 galletas saladas left.
"Response:  We know that initially Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 savory cookies. If he consumed 5 sweet cookies and 2 savory cookies, then we have:
Sweet cookies = 37 - 5 = 32
Savory cookies = 11 - 2 = 9
So, Paco consumed more sweet cookies than savory cookies. The difference between the number of sweet cookies consumed and the number of savory cookies consumed is:
Difference = 32 - 9 = 23
Therefore, Paco consumed 23 more sweet cookies than savory cookies."
Response:  We know that initially Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salted ones. So in total he had 8 + 6 = 14 galletas. Then, after eating some of them, he had 20 sweets and 34 salts left. Therefore, the difference between the number of salted cookies he had before and after eating is: 34 - 6 = 28 galletas. So, Paco ate 28 more salted cookies than sweet ones.
Response:  If Paco had 37 galletas initially and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 gallette left. So, Paco has 1 gallette left.
Response:  Paco had initially 36 galletaes and gave 14 to his friend. So now he has 36 - 14 = 22 galletas left. Then, he ate 10 more galletas, so he has 22 - 10 = 12 galletas left. Therefore, Paco has 12 galletas left.
Response:  If Paco had 41 galletas and gave 9 to his friend, then he had 41 - 9 = 32 galletas left. He also ate 18 galletas, so now he has 32 - 18 = 14 galletas left. Therefore, he ate more galletas than he gave away.
Response:  If Paco had 6 cookies and gave his friend 30, then he has 30 - 6 = 24 left. He also ate 23 of them, so now he has 24 - 23 = 1 cookie left. Therefore, he gave his friend more cookies than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 34 sweets and 97 salted ones. Then he consumed 15 sweet gallettes, so now he has 34 - 15 = 19 sweets left. Finally, he ate 56 salted gallettes, leaving him with 97 - 56 = 41 salted gallettes. Therefore, Paco has 19 sweets left.
Response:  At first, Paco had 26 + 17 = 43 galletas (a combination of both types). Then he ate 14 galletas dulces, leaving him with 43 - 14 = 29 galletas saladas. Finally, he ate 9 more galletas saladas, so now he has 29 - 9 = 20 galletas saladas left. Therefore, Paco has 20 galletas saladas left.
Response:  We know that initially Paco had 39 sweet and 6 salted gallettes. Then he consumed 23 salted gallettes. So now he has 39 - 23 = 16 sweet gallettes left. And then he consumed another 32 sweet gallettes. So finally he has 16 + 32 = 48 sweet gallettes left. Therefore, Paco consumed more sweet gallettes than salted ones. The difference between the number of sweet and salted gallettes he consumed is 48 - 6 = 42.
Response:  We know that initially Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salted ones. If he consumed 28 salted cookies, then he has 40 - 28 = 12 salted cookies left. As for the sweet cookies, if he consumed 15, then he has 40 - 15 = 25 sweet cookies left. So, Paco consumed more salted cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salted cookies consumed and sweet cookies consumed is 25 - 15 = 10. Therefore, Paco consumed 10 more salted cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  If Gwen received $7 and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, the amount of money that Gwen spent is equal to $7 - $5 = $2.
Response:  We know that Gwen received some money for her birthday and she spent $8 of it. So, if she spent $8, then she must have had $6 + $8 = $14 initially. Therefore, Gwen received $14 for her birthday.
Response:  If Gwen received $2 from her mom and her dad gave her $4 more, then she has a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she will have $6 - $3 = $3 left. So, the answer is $3.
Response:  If Gwen received $8 from her mom and then spent $4, she has $8 - $4 = $4 left. Now, if her dad gave her $5 more, that means she now has $4 + $5 = $9. So, Gwen's mom gave her more money than her dad did.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $3 from her mom and $6 from her dad, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, then she must have received more money from her dad than from her mom. So, the difference between the amount Gwen received from her dad and the amount she received from her mom is $9 - $4 = $5. Therefore, Gwen's dad gave her $5 more than her mom did.
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and then her mother gave her $7 more, that means she has a total of $12 now (5 + 7 = 12). Then, if she spent $4, she will have $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). So, Gwen received $8 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 more from her mother, then she has a total of $7. If she spent $6, that means she had $1 left after spending money. So, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother did. The amount of money given by her father is $1 ($7 - $6 = $1).
Response:  If Josh had 9 canicas in his collection and now he has 4, then he must have lost some canicas. To find out how many canicas he lost, we need to subtract the number of canicas he has now (4) from the number he had before (9). So, Josh lost 5 canicas.
Response:  If Josh had x canicas in his collection initially and lost 21 canicas, then he has x - 21 canicas now. Since he now has 12 canicas, we can set up an equation as follows: x - 21 = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 33. So, Josh had 33 canicas in his collection initially.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 canicas in his collection. Then he lost 11 canicas, so he has fewer canicas now. He found 5 new canicas, which means he gained 5 more canicas. So, the final number of canicas that Josh has is: 19 - 11 = 8 + 5 = 13. Therefore, Josh has 13 canicas in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had 4 canaries in his collection and lost 16, then he had 4 - 16 = -12 canaries left. He found 8 new canaries, so he now has 8 + (-12) = 6 canaries left. Therefore, he lost more canaries than he found.
Response:  If Josh had 7 canicas in his collection and lost 8 of them, then he had 7 - 8 = -1 canica left. Then, he found 10 new canicas, so he now has 7 + 10 = 17 canicas in his collection. Therefore, he found more canicas than he lost. The difference between the number of canicas he found and the number he lost is 17 - (-1) = 18 canicas.
Response:  If Josh had 21 canicas in his collection and he found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 canicas left in his collection. So, Josh has 14 canicas now.
Response:  Josh had 20 canicas in his collection and gave 2 to Jack. So, now he has 20 - 2 = 18 canicas left in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 22 canicas in his collection initially. Then, Jack gave him 20 more canicas. So, now Josh has 20 + 22 = 42 canicas in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 19 canicas in his collection before and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 canicas left (19 - 11 = 8). So, Josh now has 8 canicas in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 canicas in his collection. Then he found 13 new canicas, so now he has 22 + 13 = 35 canicas. However, he lost 5 canicas, so he has 35 - 5 = 30 canicas left in his collection. Therefore, Josh currently has 30 canicas in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 canicas in his collection initially and found 9 new ones, then he has a total of 15 + 9 = 24 canicas now. However, if he lost 23 canicas, then he would have 24 - 23 = 1 fewer canica than he initially had. So, he lost 1 more canica than he found. 
Response:  If Josh had 3 canaries in his collection and found 6 more, then he now has 3 + 6 = 9 canaries in total. However, if he lost 5 canaries, then he would have 9 - 5 = 4 canaries left in his collection. So, he found more canaries than he lost. Therefore, the answer is 4.
"Response:  We know that together, Marco and his dad collected 4 pounds of fresh berries. Then we are told that Marco had 19 pounds of fresh berries alone. So, to find out how much more Marco had than his dad, we can subtract the amount of berries his dad had from the total amount of berries Marco had:

19 pounds - 4 pounds = 15 pounds

Therefore, the difference in weight between the fresh berries collected by Marco and those collected by his dad is 15 pounds."
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his dad collected 35 pounds of fresh berries. Since Marco had 13 pounds of strawberries, we can say that his dad had x pounds of fresh berries, where x is the difference between 35 and 13, which is equal to 22 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the fresh berries collected by Marco's father was 22 pounds more than the weight of the fresh berries collected by Marco.
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his dad collected 20 pounds of fresh berries. If his dad's berries weighed 17 pounds, then Marco's must have weighed 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3). So, Marco's berries weigh 3 pounds.
Response:  The weight of Marco's fresh is 8 pounds and his father's fresh is 32 pounds. So together they weigh 40 pounds (8 + 32).
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 24 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries. So, now Marco has 3 pounds of strawberries left. To find out how much strawberries his dad had, we can simply subtract the weight of strawberries Marco lost from the total amount they collected: 24 - 9 = 15 pounds of strawberries left with his dad.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So, now Marco has 12 pounds of strawberries left. To find out how much weight his dad's strawberries have, we need to subtract the amount he lost from the total amount they collected initially. Therefore, the weight of strawberries his dad has is:
36 - 8 = 28 pounds."
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 22 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. So, now the total weight of all the strawberries they have is: 22 + 30 = 52 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the strawberries that Marco's dad has is 52 - 22 = 30 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 37 pounds of fresh berries. If Marco's berries weighed 15 pounds, then his dad's berries must have weighed 22 pounds (37 - 15 = 22).
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad went to pick strawberries together. The weight of Marco's strawberries is 30 pounds. If we add up all their strawberries, they will weigh 17 pounds less than the total weight of Marco's strawberries. So, how much more do Marco's strawberries weigh than his father's? $30 - 17 = 13$ pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weigh 13 pounds more than his father's.
Response:  If Marco's freshes weigh 10 pounds and his father's freshes weight x pounds, then together they weigh 26 pounds. So, x - 10 = 26. Therefore, his father's freshes weigh 16 pounds more than Marco's.
Response:  We know that the total weight of Marco and his dad's fresh is 30 pounds (or 30 lbs). Since Marco's dad's fresh weighs 11 pounds, then Marco's fresh must have weighed 29 pounds (or 29 lbs). Therefore, the answer is 29 pounds.
Response:  Before the stop of the bus, there were 2 children inside it. Then, some more children boarded the bus at the stop, so now there are 10 children in total. To find out how many more children are inside the bus than before, we need to subtract the original number from the new one: 10 - 2 = 8. So, there are 8 more children inside the bus than before.
Response:  The initial number of children was 26 + 38 = 64. So there are 64 children in the bus now.
Response:  We know that some children were already riding the bus before it reached the stop. So let's call the number of children who were already riding the bus x. Then, when the bus stopped, 2 more children got on board, so the total number of children on the bus is x + 2. Finally, we are told that there were 41 children in total on the bus, including those who were already riding it and those who got on at the stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 41. Solving for x, we get x = 39. So, before the bus stopped, 39 children were riding it.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off. In this case, we are asked how many children got off the bus at the stop. Therefore, the answer is 43 - 21 = 22. So, 22 children got off the bus at the stop.
"Response:  Before the bus stop, there were 41 children on the bus. After some children got off at the bus stop, there were 18 children left on the bus. So, the difference between the number of children before and after is equal to the original number of children minus the number of children who got off at the bus stop. Therefore, the answer is:

Difference = 41 - 18 = 23

So, there were 23 more children on the bus before the bus stop than there are now."
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus and then 10 of them got off while some more boarded the bus. So, the number of children who boarded the bus is equal to the number of children who got off minus 10 = 10 - 10 = 0. Therefore, no children boarded the bus at the stop.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children in the bus and then 63 children got off while some more got on. So, the number of children in the bus after this process is:

Initially 5 + (63 - 5) = 68

So, the number of children who got on the bus is:
72 - 68 = 4
Therefore, 4 children got on the bus more than those who got off."
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and then 68 children got off while some more got on. So, the number of children who got on the bus is equal to the number of children who got off minus 68. Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus = 68 - 36 = 32. Hence, 32 children got on the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children on the bus and then 40 more got on while some got off. So, the total number of children on the bus at one point was 22 + 40 = 62. Then, we are told that there were only 2 children left on the bus after some got off. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 62 - 2 = 60. So, 60 children got off the bus at the stop.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 children got into the bus while some left it. So, the total number of children in the bus after this process is:

28 + 82 = 110

Now, we are told that there were 30 children in the bus at the end. So, the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children is:

110 - 30 = 80

Therefore, 80 children more than those who got off the bus boarded the bus."
Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children in the bus and then 24 children got on while some got off. So, the total number of children in the bus at first was 23 + 24 = 47. Now we are told that there were 8 children left in the bus after some got off. Therefore, the number of children who got off is 8 - 47 = -49. Since negative numbers indicate an amount subtracted, it means that 49 children got off the bus than those who got on.
Response:  If the baker made 133 pastries and sold 51 of them, then he must have made 82 more pastries than those that were sold (133 - 51 = 82). Therefore, the number of pastries the baker made is 82 + 51 = 133.
Response:  We know that the baker made 54 pastries and still has 13 left. So, if he sold some of them, we can say that the number of pastries he sold is equal to the difference between the total number of pastries he made and the number of pastries he still has. In this case, it would be: Total = 54 - 13 = 41 pastries. Therefore, the baker sold 41 pastries.
"Response:  We know that the baker made some pies and sold them. The statement ""Today he still has 72"" means that there are 72 left after selling some. So we can say that the number of pies sold is equal to the number of pies remaining minus 72. In other words, if x represents the number of pies sold, then:
x = 72 - (number of pies remaining)
Now, let's substitute the information given in the problem:
x = 72 - 145
Solving for x, we get:
x = -73
So, according to this calculation, the baker did not make any pies! This result makes no sense since the question states that the baker did indeed make some pies. Therefore, we must conclude that the question contains an error or ambiguity."
Response:  If the panadero made 155 pastries and his friend bought 140 of them, then he has 15 - 14 = 1 left over. So, there is one pastry left over for the panadero.
Response:  The panadero made 121 pastries and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) left. Then, he bought 170 new pastries, so now he has 36 (16 + 170) pastries in total. Therefore, the panadero still has 36 pastries.
Response:  The panader made 13 pastries and sold 91 of them. So he has 13 - 91 = 78 remaining pastries. He then bought 154 new pastries. Therefore, the number of pastries more that the baker bought than those sold is 154 - 91 = 63 additional pastries.
Response:  The panadero made 170 pastries and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new pastries. Now he has 63 pastries left (92 - 31 = 63). Therefore, the panadero sold more pastries than he bought. Answer: 63 - 31 = 32.
Response:  The baker made 110 pastries and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made 76 more pastries. So now he has 35 + 76 = 111 pastries in total.
Response:  The baker made 144 pastries and sold 71 of them. So he has 73 remaining (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made 111 more pastries. So now he has in total 73 + 111 = 184 pastries. Therefore, the number of pastries that the baker had left after selling some is 184 - 71 = 113 pastries.
Response:  The panadero made 149 pastries and sold 10 of them. So he has 139 left (149 - 10 = 139). Then, he sold another 90 pastries, so now he has 49 left (139 - 90 = 49). Therefore, the panadero has 49 pastries left.
Response:  The panadero made 7 + 148 = 155 pastries in total. He sold 15 of them and then he had 155 - 15 = 140 left. So, there are 140 pastries left with the panadero.
Response:  The panader made 126 + 48 = 174 pastries in total. If he sold 115 and 81, then he has left with 174 - (115 + 81) = 98 pastries. So, the panadero made more than 98 pastries than what he sold.
Response:  The panader made 19 + 131 = 150 pastries in total. He sold 70 and 88 pastries, so he has left 150 - (70 + 88) = 150 - 158 = -18 pastries. Therefore, the panadero made more pastries than he sold.
Response:  The panadero made 157 + 169 = 326 pastries in total. He sold 158 + 147 = 305 pastries. So, he sold 21 more pastries than he made (305 - 326). Therefore, the panadero sold 21 additional pastries.
Response:  The panadero made 54 + 143 = 197 pastries in total. He sold 68 + 92 = 160 pastries. So, he sold 37 more pastries than he made (160 - 197). Therefore, the panadero sold 37 additional pastries.
Response:  If initially he had made 48 pastries and sold 44 of them, then he has 4 left. So, the number of pastries that the baker has is 4.
Response:  If initially there were 40 pastries and he sold 8, then there are 32 left (40 - 8 = 32). So, the baker made more than those that he sold. The difference between what he made and what he sold is equal to the number of pastries he had at first minus the ones he sold. Therefore, the answer is 32.
"Response:  If the friend of the baker bought 137 pastries and initially there were 169 pastries, then we can say that the number of pastries left with the baker is equal to the initial number minus the number purchased by his friend. So, the number of pastries left with the baker is:

Initial number = 169 - 137 = 32

Therefore, the baker has 32 pastries left."
Response:  The panadero made 173 pastries and sold 86 of them. This means he has 87 pastries left (173 - 86 = 87). Then, he bought 103 new pastries, so now he has a total of 87 + 103 = 190 pastries. Therefore, the panadero still has 190 pastries today.
Response:  The panadero made 99 pastries and bought 167 new ones. He sold 89 pastries, so he has 78 left (99 - 89 = 78). So, the panadero more than bought that many pastries than he sold. Therefore, the answer is positive infinity (∞).
Response:  The panadero bought 139 new pastries and sold 145 pastries in total. So, he sold more pastries than he bought. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of pastries he bought from the number of pastries he sold: 145 - 139 = 6. Therefore, the panadero sold 6 more pastries than he bought.
"Response:  The panadero made 62 pastries first and then added 149 more. So, in total, he made 62 + 149 = 211 pastries. He sold 144 of them, so...
Question: El panadero hace 30 bolas de masa para hacer tortitas. Si cada bola pesa 50 gramos, ¿cuánto pesan todas las tortitas que ha hecho el panadero?

Formula: To find out how much pan the panadero can make with a certain amount of flour, you can use the formula: Amount of pan = Flour / Conversion factor. In this case, the conversion factor is 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. So..."
Response:  The panader made 81 + 92 = 173 pastries in total. He sold 46 of them. So he must have made more than those that he sold. In other words, the difference between the number of pastries he made and the number he sold is equal to the number he sold. Therefore, the number of pastries the panadero made more than he sold is: 173 - 46 = 127.
Response:  The panadero made 61 pastries and 167 tortas, so he has a total of 228 baked goods (61 + 167 = 228). If he sold 108 tortas, then he has 228 - 108 = 120 tortas left. Similarly, if he sold 44 pastries, then he has 228 - 44 = 184 pastries left. Therefore, the panadero has 120 tortas and 184 pastries left.
Response:  The panadero made 56 pastelés and 124 tortas, so he has a total of 180 baked goods (56 + 124 = 180). If he sold 104 tortas and 29 pastelés, then he is left with 76 baked goods (180 - 104 - 29 = 76). So, there are 76 pastelés left at the panadero's shop.
Response:  The panader made 52 pastries and 84 tortillas. If he sold 102 tortillas and 94 pastries, we can calculate how many more tortillas than pastries he made as follows: Number of tortillas sold = 102 Number of pastries sold = 94 Difference between number of tortillas and pastries = 102 - 94 = 8 So, the panadero made 8 more tortillas than pastries.
Response:  The panadero made 134 pastries and 11 tortas initially. If he sold 140 tortas, then he had 140 - 11 = 129 pastries left to sell. Similarly, if he sold 92 pastries, then he had 92 - 134 = -42 pastries left to sell (since he already sold 134). So, the panadero made more pastries than tortas.
Response:  The panadero made 14 + 153 = 167 pastries and sold 8 + 97 = 105 pastries. So, he sold 62 more pastries than he made (167 - 105 = 62).
Response:  The panadero made 43 + 114 = 157 pastries and sold 154 + 78 = 232 pastries. So, the panadero sold 232 - 157 = 75 more pastries than he made.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games of Nintendo and needs to have 140 games left after buying some more, then we can calculate how many more games she needs to buy as follows:

Number of games Kelly already has = 22
Desired number of games after buying = 140 - 22 = 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games of Nintendo."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games of Nintendo and she gives away 64 games, then she will have... (106 - 64) = 42 games left.
Response:  If Kelly initially had 91 games of Nintendo and now has 92, that means she gained one game. So, initially, she had 91 - 1 = 90 games of Nintendo.
"Response:  Kelly has 20 games of Nintendo and wants to have 12 left after giving some away. So we need to find out how many games he needs to give away in order to reach that goal. We can do this by subtracting the number of games he already has (20) from the number he wants to have left (12):

20 - 12 = 8

So, Kelly needs to give away 8 games of Nintendo in order to have 12 left."
"Response:  Kelly has 46 games of Nintendo and 132 games of Sony. To find out how many games of Sony she needs to give away for her to have 31 games left, we can subtract the number of games of Sony she already has from the total number of games she has:

Total number of games = 46 + 132 = 178
Number of games of Sony to give away = Total number of games - Number of games of Sony she wants to keep (31)
= 178 - 31
= 147
Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 147 games of Sony to have 31 games left."
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and she found 31 more, then she now has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games of Nintendo. To find out how many games she needs to give away to leave her with 6 games, we can divide 111 by 6: 111 / 6 = 18. So, Kelly needs to give away 18 games of Nintendo to leave herself with 6 games.
"Response:  We know that Randy had x blocks at first. If he used 52 blocks to build a tower and there are now 38 blocks left, then we can write an equation:
x + 52 = 38
Now solve for x:
x = 38 - 52
x = -14
So Randy initially had 14 blocks."
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he has 72 blocks left after building the tower, then we can say that he used x blocks to build the tower, where x is the number of blocks left after construction (72). Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation: 97 - x = 72. Solving for x, we get x = 25. So, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  If Randy has 79 blocks and uses 14 to build a tower, he will have 79 - 14 = 65 blocks left. Then, if he uses 11 blocks to build a house, he will have 65 - 11 = 54 blocks left. Therefore, there are 54 blocks left.
Response:  We know that Randy used 27 blocks to build the tower and 53 blocks to build the house. So, in total, he used 27 + 53 = 80 blocks.
Response:  The number of blocks used to build a tower is 33 and for building a house it is 13. So we need to find out how many more blocks were used in building the tower than in building the house. To do this, we can subtract the number of blocks used in building the house from the number of blocks used in building the tower: 33 - 13 = 20. Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
"Response:  We know that Randy used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. So, we can write this as:
Tower = 79 blocks
House = 82 blocks
Now, let's find out how many more blocks Randy used for building the house than for building the tower:
More blocks used in building the house = House - Tower
= 82 - 79
= 3 blocks
Therefore, Randy used 3 blocks more to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response:  If Randy has 59 blocks and he needs to build a tower with 36 blocks, then we can calculate how many blocks are left over as follows:

Number of blocks available = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks needed for the tower
= 59 - 36
= 23

So, there are 23 blocks left over after Randy builds his tower using 36 blocks."
Response:  The number of blocks used to build a house is 20 and for building a tower it is 50. So we can write this as an equation: 20 + x = 50 where x represents the number of blocks used to build the tower minus the number of blocks used to build the house. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: x = 30. Therefore, Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks in total. He used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. So, we can write this as an equation: 89 + 63 = x, where x is the number of blocks Randy used to build the house. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 63 from both sides of the equation: 89 - 63 = x. Simplifying, we get x = 26. Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have not read 5 of them, that means you have read 15 books (20 - 5 = 15). So, the answer is 15.
Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series and there are still 8 books left to read, that means there are a total of 21 books in the series. Therefore, the answer is 21.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and you have already read 12 of them. So, the number of books left to read is:

22 - 12 = 10

So, you still have 10 books left to read from the series ""Crazy Silly School."""
"Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies in total in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 19 books, then you still need to watch 8 more movies (17 - 19 = 8). Therefore, the answer is 8."
Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series Crazy Silly School. If you read 19 of the books, then you have not read 7 books (since 19 - 7 = 12). Similarly, if you see 13 movies, then you have seen fewer than 14 movies (since 13 < 14). Therefore, there are more books than movies in the series Crazy Silly School. Specifically, for every 4 movies, there are 5 books ( since 14 / 4 = 3.5 books per movie, but we rounded up to the nearest whole number). So, there are 3.5 x 4 = 14 books for every 13 movies.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series Crazy Silly School. If you read 19 of the books, then you have seen 19/8 = 2.375 books (since we can't read more than 8). Now, if you see 61 movies out of 10, then you have seen 61/10 = 6.1 movies more than you have read books. So, there are 6.1 - 2.375 = 3.725 more movies than books in the series Crazy Silly School.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 13 books, then you have not read any of the movies yet because we were told that you have seen only 12 movies. Therefore, the number of books you have read more than movies is 13 - 12 = 1. So, you have read one book more than the number of movies you have watched."
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in total. If you have read 7 books, then you have not seen any of the movies yet (since reading books does not involve watching movies). So, the number of movies you have watched is equal to 17 - 7 = 10. Therefore, you have watched 10 more movies than books you have read.
"Response:  If you have read 8 books from the series ""Loca Escuela Tonta"" and there are a total of 14 books in the series, then you still have 6 more books to read (14 - 8 = 6)."
Response:  If there are 62 movies and you have seen 34 of them, that means you still have to see 28 movies (62 - 34 = 28). Similarly, if there are 19 books and you have read 4 of them, that means you still have to read 15 books (19 - 4 = 15). So, in total, you have 28 movies and 15 books left to consume from the series.
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in total. If you have read 7 books, then you have seen 7/21 = 35% of the books. Similarly, if you have watched 4 movies, then you have seen 4/8 = 50% of the movies. So, the number of movies left for you to watch is (8 - 4) = 4.
Response:  We know that there are 14 movies and 15 books in total in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have seen 11 of the books, then we can say that there are 15 - 11 = 4 more books left to read. Similarly, if you have watched 40 of the movies, then we can say that there are 14 - 40 = 7 more movies left to watch. Therefore, there are 4 more books than movies in the series Crazy Silly School. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series Crazy Silly School. If you read 13 books and watched 63 movies, we can deduce that you have not seen all of the movies or read all of the books in the series. Therefore, the number of movies that you haven't seen is equal to the total number of movies minus the number of movies you have seen, which is 17 - 63 = -46 movies. Similarly, the number of books that you haven't read is equal to the total number of books minus the number of books you have read, which is 11 - 13 = -8 books. So, there are -46 movies and -8 books left in the series that you haven't seen or read yet.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 14 movies and seen 19 books, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than movies as follows:
Number of books read - Number of movies watched = Number of books more read than movies
= 19 - 14 = 5
So, you have read 5 more books than movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 19 movies and seen 16 books, then we can calculate how many more movies than books you have watched as follows:
Number of movies you have watched = Number of movies in the series - Number of movies you have seen
= 5 - 16
= -11
So, you have watched 11 fewer movies than books."
Response:  If Dave won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 3 tickets for that purpose (since he had 7 - 3 = 4 tickets left). So, Dave used 3 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave won some tickets in the arcade and used 12 of them to buy some toys, that means he has 14 - 12 = 2 more tickets left. So, Dave gained 2 tickets in the arcade.
Response:  If Dave had won 18 tickets and used 5 to buy some toys, he would have 13 left (18 - 5 = 13). Then, if he used 11 more to buy clothes, he would be left with 2 tickets (13 - 11 = 2). Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Dave used 12 tickets to buy some toys and 7 more to buy clothes, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 tickets left over for other things (like food or drinks). So, Dave used 7 tickets to buy clothes.
Response:  If Dave used 8 boletos to buy some toys and 18 more to buy clothes, then he spent 8 + 18 = 26 boletos in total for buying things other than games. Since he won 13 boletos playing games, that means he has 13 - 26 = -13 boletos left over after buying things. So, Dave used -13 boletos to buy clothes instead of using them to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. Then, if he used 10 tickets to buy some toys, he will have 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. So, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  We know that initially, Haley had planted 14 trees in her backyard. After the hurricane, 9 of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is equal to the initial number minus the number of dead trees. In other words, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Surviving Trees = Initial Number - Number of Dead Trees. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of Surviving Trees = 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, 5 trees more died than survived in the hurricane.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees in her backyard and after the hurricane, 6 of them died. So, we have 13 - 6 = 7 trees left alive. Therefore, there were 7 more trees that survived the hurricane than the ones that died.
Response:  We know that Haley initially planted 20 trees in her backyard. After the hurricane, only 4 trees remained standing. So, we can say that 16 trees died (or were destroyed) during the hurricane. Therefore, the answer is 16.
"Response:  If Haley had planted x trees and after the storm, there were 12 trees left, then we can write an equation as follows:
x - 5 = 12
Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method.
Solution: Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:
x = 7
Therefore, Haley had planted 7 trees in her backyard."
"Response: 
Haley had 9 trees initially. After the storm, 4 died, leaving her with 9 - 4 = 5 trees left. Then she planted 5 more trees, so now she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total."
Response:  We know that after the hurricane, two trees died. So initially, there were 12 trees and now there are 10 trees left (since 2 died). Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in their backyard.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 trees in the backyard of Haley. After the hurricane, 13 trees died. So, the number of surviving trees is equal to the initial number minus the number of dead trees. In this case, it would be 3 - 13 = -10. Therefore, 10 more trees died than survived.
Response:  We know that initially there were 11 trees in the backyard of Haley. After the hurricane, 2 trees died. So, the number of surviving trees is equal to 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, 9 trees survived the hurricane.
"Response:  If they harvest 66 bags per day and each bag contains 28 oranges, then...
Step-by-step calculation:
1. How many bags do they harvest in total per day?
66 bags/day x 28 oranges/bag = 1,792 oranges/day
Therefore, they harvest 1,792 oranges per day."
"Response:  If they harvest 8 bags per day, it will take them x days to collect 24 bags of oranges. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x = number of days required to collect 24 bags of oranges
Now, we are given that they harvest 8 bags per day, so we can substitute this value in the equation as follows:
x = 8
Now, we need to find out what 'x' represents. Since we want to know how many days it will take to collect 24 bags of oranges, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:
x / 8 = number of days required to collect 24 bags of oranges
So, the answer is:
x / 8 = 3
Therefore, it will take them 3 days to collect 24 bags of oranges."
"Response:  If the harvest lasts for 4 days and they collected a total of 56 bags of oranges, then we can calculate how many bags they collect per day as follows:

Total number of bags = Number of days x Total number of bags collected
= 4 x 56
= 224

Therefore, they collect 224 bags of oranges per day during the 4-day harvest period."
Response:  After 49 days of harvesting oranges, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1752 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 87 days of harvesting, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5904 naranjas.
Response:  If they harvest 8 bags per day and each bag contains 35 oranges, then the total number of oranges harvested daily is 8 x 35 = 280 oranges. So, the correct answer is 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they harvest 16 bags per day and each bag contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will collect 936 oranges (16 x 57 = 936). To gather 80 bags of oranges, it would take them 80 / 936 = 84 days. Therefore, the correct answer is 84 days.
Response:  If they harvest 67 bags of oranges per day and each bag contains 12 oranges, then in one day they will harvest 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. To find out how many oranges are harvested in total, we need to know how many days they harvest oranges for. So if they harvest oranges for 35 days, then they will harvest 804 x 35 = 28,200 oranges in total.
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 74 x 51 = 3650 bags of oranges. Since they discard 71 bags per day, after 51 days they will have 3650 - (71 x 51) = 2985 bags left. Therefore, after 51 days of harvesting, they will have 2985 bags of oranges.
Response:  If they produce 76 bags per day and discard 64 of them, that means they have produced a total of 76 x 50 = 3800 naranjas (or oranges) per day. So, they harvest 3800 naranjas (or oranges) per day.  
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 704 bags of oranges. Since there are also 52 bags of green oranges per day, after 26 days they will have collected 52 x 26 = 1328 bags of green oranges. Therefore, in total, they will have collected 704 + 1328 = 2032 bags of oranges after 26 days of harvesting.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 82 = 2050 sacos of oranges. Since there are also green oranges, let's assume that after 25 days, they will have collected 25 x 61 = 1525 green oranges. Therefore, in total, they will have collected 3575 sacos of oranges (2050 + 1525).
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 31 x 45 = 1365 bags of mature oranges and 24 x 45 = 1080 bags of green oranges. So, after 45 days, they will have 1365 + 1080 = 2445 bags of oranges in total. Since there are 24 bags of green oranges per day, this means that after 45 days, they will have 24 x 45 = 1080 bags of green oranges. Therefore, the final number of bags of green oranges is 1080.   Explanation: We know that after 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1365 bags of mature oranges and 1080 bags of green oranges. Since there are 24 bags of green oranges per day, we can calculate the final number of bags of green oranges as follows: 1080 (bags of green oranges) = 24 x 45 (days of harvesting) So, the final answer is 1080 bags of green oranges.
"Response:  If they harvest 44 bags of mature oranges and 25 bags of green oranges per day, then we can write this as:

Number of bags of mature oranges = 44
Number of bags of green oranges = 25

Now, let's find out how many more bags of mature oranges are harvested than green oranges:

Difference between number of bags of mature oranges and number of bags of green oranges = Number of bags of mature oranges - Number of bags of green oranges
= 44 - 25
= 19

So, 19 more bags of mature oranges are harvested than green oranges per day."
"Response:  If they produce 74 bags of green oranges and 5 bags of mature oranges per day, then we can write this as:
Green oranges produced = 74 bags/day x Green oranges per bag = 740 orange bags/day
Mature oranges produced = 5 bags/day x Mature oranges per bag = 25 orange bags/day
So, the difference in production between green and mature oranges is:
Difference in production = 740 - 25 = 715 orange bags/day
Therefore, more green oranges are produced than mature oranges per day by 715 bags."
"Response:  If they harvested 54 bags of oranges in total, and they picked 18 bags per day, then it took them how many days to collect all those oranges? 

Step-by-step calculation:
Total number of bags = Total number of days x Number of bags per day
= 54 bags / 18 bags per day = 3 days
Therefore, it took them 3 days to collect all 54 bags of oranges."
"Response:  If they harvested 56 bags of oranges in total, and they worked for 14 days, then we can calculate how many bags they harvested per day as follows:

Total number of bags = Total number of working days x Number of bags per day
= 14 x?

So, if they harvested 56 bags of oranges in total, and they worked for 14 days, then they must have harvested 56/14 = 4 bags of oranges per day."
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 73 x 5 = 365 bags of mature oranges. Therefore, after 73 days of harvesting, they will have 365 bags of mature oranges.
Response:  After 1 day of harvesting, they collected 65 bags of green oranges and 46 bags of mature oranges. So in total, they collected 65 + 46 = 111 bags of oranges that first day. Now, if they continue to collect at this rate for 6 days, then after 6 days, they will have collected 111 x 6 = 666 bags of oranges!
Response:  If they harvest 86 sacs of mature oranges per day and 41 bags of green oranges per day, then the difference between the number of bags of mature oranges and the number of bags of green oranges is equal to the total number of bags of both types that are harvested daily. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 86 - 41 = x, where x represents the total number of bags of both types harvested daily. Solving for x, we get x = 45. So, every day they harvest 45 more bags of mature oranges than green oranges.
"Response:  If they harvest 71 bags of green oranges and 60 bags of mature oranges per day, then we can write this as:
Green oranges = 71/2 = 35.5 bags per day
Mature oranges = 60/2 = 30 bags per day
So, more green oranges are harvested than mature ones per day. The difference between these two quantities is:
Difference = Green oranges - Mature oranges = 35.5 - 30 = 5.5 bags per day"
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 12 feet and its width is given as 11 feet. To find out how much longer his room is than it is wide, we can use the following formula: Length - Width = (Longer dimension). In this case, the longer dimension is the length of the room, which is 12 feet. So, the difference between the length and width of Jesse's room is: 12 ft - 11 ft = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.
"Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 7 feet = 84 inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So, we can start by finding out how many inches wide Jesse needs his carpet to be:

Jesse needs a carpet that covers 14 feet squared. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, this means he needs a carpet that covers 14 x 12 = 168 square inches.

Now, since each foot of the room is 84 inches long, we know that one foot of the carpet will cover 84 inches. Therefore, the width of the carpet needed for Jesse's room is:

Width = Room length / Carpet width per foot = 84 inches / 84 inches/foot = 1 foot = 12 inches

So, the width of Jesse's room is 12 inches."
"Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 7 feet wide (or 84 inches). To find out how long it is, we need to multiply its width by its length. So, if the room needs an area of 14 square feet, then its length must be:
Length = Width x Area needed / Square footage of carpet
Length = 84 in × 14 ft² / 0.09 sf
Length = 1260 in or approximately 108 feet
Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 108 feet."
Response:  The room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, so its area is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since it already has 16 square feet of carpet, we need to find out how much more carpet it needs to cover the rest of the floor. To do this, divide the total area of the room (165 square feet) by the amount of carpet it already has (16 square feet): 165 / 16 = 10.3125 square feet. So, Jessie needs approximately 10.3125 square feet of additional carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The room measures 2 feet x 12 feet = 24 square feet. Since each tile covers 4 square feet, we need... (1/4) \* (24 sq ft) = 6 tiles to cover the entire floor. Therefore, there are 6 tiles needed to cover all of Jessie's floor.
Response:  The length of each room is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet. To find out how many square feet there are in each room, we multiply the length by the width: 19 x 18 = 342 square feet per room. Since there are 20 rooms in total, the total area of all the rooms is 342 square feet x 20 = 6,840 square feet. Now, to determine how much carpeting is needed, we divide the total area by the size of one roll of carpeting (which is usually sold in square yards): 6,840 / 12 = approximately 570 square yards. So, Jesse needs about 570 square yards of carpeting to cover the floors of all his rooms.
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is given as 19 feet and its length is given as 20 feet. To find out how much longer his room is than it is wide, we can use the following formula: Length - Width = (Longer dimension) - (Shorter dimension). In this case, the longer dimension is the length of the room (20 feet), and the shorter dimension is the width of the room (19 feet). So, we have: 20 - 19 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer in length than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs an area of 10 square feet to cover his room. Since he has 5 feet of length in his room, we can say that the width is half of this value (since it must be equal to the length). So, the width of the room is 2.5 feet or 30 inches.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs an area of 10 feet squared for his room. Since he has 2 feet of width, we can say that the length is equal to 10 / 2 = 5 feet. So, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.
Response:  The room measures 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so it has an area of 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet, he needs more to cover the remaining area of the floor. Therefore, he needs (80 - 18) = 62 square feet of additional carpet.
"Response:  We know that the store makes $23 for each shirt sold. So if they sell x shirts, they will make $23x dollars in total. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they made $230 selling shirts. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
$23x = 230... (1)
Now we need to solve for x. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by $23:
x = 230 / $23... (2)
So, there were 10 shirts sold ($230 / $23)."
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned by Razorback is $51 and they sold 3 camisetas during the game. So, we can calculate the price of each shirt as follows: Total revenue = Number of camisetas x Price per camiseta Total revenue = $51 Cost per camiseta = Total revenue / Number of camisetas Cost per camiseta = $51 / 3 Camisetas = $17 per camiseta Therefore, the cost of each camiseta is $17.
Response:  We know that the store makes $87 per sold t-shirt and they sold a total of 95 shirts during both games. So if they sold 47 shirts during the Arkansas game, then they made $403 ($87 x 47) in revenue from selling those shirts alone.
Response:  We know that the store earned $106 per each sold shirt during both games combined. So if they sold x shirts during the Arkansas game and made $106x dollars in profit, then they must have sold (242 - 115) = 127 shirts during the Texas Tech game. Therefore, the answer is 127.
Response:  We know that the Razorback store makes $ 98 per sold t-shirt. So if they sell x t-shirts during the game of Arkansas, they will make $ 98x dollars. Now we are told that they sold 89 t-shirts during the game of Arkansas. Therefore, the amount of money earned by selling t-shirts during the game of Arkansas is $ 98 x 89 = $ 8742.
Response:  We know that Razorback Store makes $78 per sold t-shirt. So if they sell x t-shirts during the game of Texas Tech, then they will make $78x dollars. Now we are given that they sold 186 t-shirts in total during both games. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the game of Arkansas, then they sold 14 (186 - 172) t-shirts during the game of Texas Tech. Therefore, they made $78(14) = $1052 dollars during the game of Texas Tech.
Response:  We know that la tienda Razorback gains $62 for each t-shirt and $99 for each hoodie. So if they sold x t-shirts and y hoodies, their total revenue would be 62x + 99y dollars. Now we are given that they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 hoodies. So we can substitute these values into our equation to find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts: 62(183) = 11540 and 99(31) = 3079. Therefore, the tienda Razorback gained $11540 from selling t-shirts and $3079 from selling hoodies.
Response:  We know that the store makes $67 for each t-shirt and $165 for each jersey. So if they sold x jerseys, they made $165x dollars in total. Since there are 74 t-shirts sold, we can find out how much money they made from selling those by multiplying 74 by $67: $$=74\times67=4898$$So the store made $4898 from selling t-shirts. Now, let's find out how much money they made from selling jerseys. Since there are 156 jerseys sold, we can multiply that number by $165 to get the total amount of money they made: $$=156\times165=25390$$So the store made $25390 from selling jerseys. Therefore, the total amount of money the store made during the game is $4898 + $25390 = $30288$.
"Response:  The cost of one camiseta is $192 and that of one jersey is $34. So, we can write an equation as follows: Camiseta = $192 Jerse...

Question: La tienda Razorback gana $192 dólares por each camiseta and $34 per each jersey. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 157 camisetas and 19 jerseys. How much more does a camiseta cost than a jersey?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step. The cost of one camiseta is $192, and that of one jersey is $34. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Camiseta = $192
Jersey = $34

Now, let's find out how much more a camiseta costs than a jersey:

Cost of camiseta - Cost of jersey = $192 - $34
= $158

Therefore, a camiseta costs $158 more than a jersey."
Response:  The cost of each jersey is $232 and the cost of each camiseta is $86. So if we want to find out how much more a jersey costs than a camiseta, we need to subtract the price of a camiseta from the price of a jersey. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a jersey and a camiseta is: $232 - $86 = $146. So, a jersey costs $146 more than a camiseta.
Response:  The cost price of each camiseta is $51 dollars and during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech they sold 130 camisetas after offering an discount of $8 per camiseta. So we can write down as follows: Total amount earned = Number of camisetas sold x Cost price per camiseta - Discount offered per camiseta. In this case, total amount earned = 130 x $51 - 130 x $43 = $6930 - $5270 = $1660. Therefore, the money gained from selling the t-shirts was $1660.
Response:  The original price of each camiseta is $ 201 dollars and during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech they increased to $ 217 dollars. If they sold 14 camisetas, we can calculate the total amount of money gained as follows: Total amount = Number of camisetas x Original price per camiseta + (Number of camisetas x Increase in price per camiseta) Total amount = 14 x $ 201 + ($ 14 x $ 217) Total amount = $ 2854 + $ 3094 Total amount = $ 6048 dollars. Therefore, the Razorback store earned $ 6048 selling those 14 camisetas during that particular game.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling shirts is $60 and we are also given that each shirt sold earns $10. So, if x represents the number of shirts sold, then we can write an equation as follows: 60 = 10x. Now, to find out how many shirts were sold, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 60/10 = 6. Therefore, 6 shirts were sold during the game.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned by selling camisetas was $215 and we want to find out how much each camiseta cost. So, let's divide the total amount of money earned by the number of camisetas sold: $215 / 5 = $43 per camiseta. Therefore, the cost of each camiseta is $43.
Response:  We know that the store earns $5 for each jersey and $215 for each camiseta. So if they sold x jerseys, they earned $5x dollars, and if they sold y camisetas, they earned $215y dollars. Now we have two equations: 5x + 215y = 5(20) + 215(64). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 8 and y = 32. Therefore, the store earned $400 (5x + 215y) in total.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling shirts and jerseys is given as $76 per shirt and $204 per jersey. So, if they sold x shirts and y jerseys, their total earnings would be $76x + $204y. We are told that they sold 158 camisetas (shirts) and 2 jerseys. Therefore, we can set up the equation: $76x + $204y = $1392. Solving for y, we get y = 2. So, they earned $204 in revenue from selling jerseys.
Response:  The cost of each jersey is $240 and the cost of each camiseta is $210. So if we want to find out how much more expensive a camiseta is than a jersey, we can subtract the price of a jersey from the price of a camiseta: $240 - $210 = $30. Therefore, a camiseta costs $30 more than a jersey.
Response:  The cost of each jersey is $25 more than the cost of each camiseta. So if we know that the price of a camiseta is x dollars, then the price of a jersey would be x + $25 = 115 dollars. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a jersey and a camiseta is $90 ($115 - $25).
Response:  If they have 5 games of tables and each game has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. So, they have 50 more chairs than tables.
Response:  Since they have two tables with the same number of chairs and there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard, we can say that each table has 6 chairs. Therefore, there are 6 chairs for each table. 
Response:  We know that there are 9 sillas in the backyard. If each game of tables has 3 chairs, then we can say that the number of games of tables is equal to the number of sillas divided by 3. So, the number of games of tables is 9 / 3 = 3. Therefore, they have 3 games of tables in their backyard.
Response:  If they have 11 games of tables and each game has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 11 x 13 = 133 chairs. So, they have 133 chairs in their backyard.
Response:  If they have 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs, then there are 10 x 6 = 60 chairs in total. If there are 11 people sitting in the chairs, that means 11 - 60 = -49 chairs are left unoccupied. So, there are 49 empty chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Additionally, there are 6 extra chairs. So, the final answer is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs for the guests.
Response:  If they have 4 tables and each table has 3 chairs, then they have in total 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since there will be 14 people attending the party, they will need 14 - 12 = 2 more chairs. So, they should buy 2 additional chairs.
Response:  We know that they have 14 chairs per table and there are 9 tables in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of chairs = Total number of tables x Number of chairs per table  Number of chairs = 9 x 14  Number of chairs = 126  Therefore, they have 126 additional chairs beyond what is needed for the nine tables.
Response:  If Si Lewis wins a total of $460 during 5 weeks of harvest, that means he won $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks).
"Response:  We know that Lewis gained a total of $1216 during the harvest. If he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks the harvest lasted as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
Therefore, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks."
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of harvest season and has to pay $702 in taxes, his total income after taxes will be: Total Income = Weekly Earnings x Number of Weeks Worked - Taxes Total Income = $21 x 216 - $702 = $384 After calculating the total income, we can see that Lewis will have $384 at the end of the harvest season.
"Response:  If Si Lewis earns $1357 per week during each of the 223 weeks of a harvest season, then he will have earned a total amount of:
$1357 x 223 = $296,031
If he works for 73 harvest seasons, his total earnings would be:
$296,031 x 73 = $20,480,933
Therefore, Si Lewis will have earned $20,480,933 if he works for 73 harvest seasons."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $28 per week during the harvest season and also makes $939 per week for working overtime hours. To find out how much he earns during the harvest season, we need to calculate the total number of weeks in the season. According to the question, it takes 1091 weeks to complete the harvest season. Therefore, Lewis earns:
Total amount earned = Number of weeks x Weekly income
= 1091 x $28
= $29764
So, Lewis earns $29,764 during the harvest season."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $403 per week during the 233 weeks of harvest season. To calculate how much he makes in total, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks:
$403 x 233 = $91,630
Now, let's subtract the $49 weekly rental fee to find out how much money Lewis actually keeps for himself:
$91,630 - $49 x 233 = $75,870
So, Lewis makes $75,870 during the harvest season."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $368 per week during the 1359 weeks of the harvest season. If he has to pay $388 in rent each week, then he pays $388 x 1359 = $527,402 in rent for the entire harvest season.
Response:  The total number of weeks in the season is given as 1181. Since Lewis earns $491 per week and has to pay $216 in rent each week, his take-home pay will be $491 - $216 = $275 per week. Therefore, at the end of the season, he will have earned a total of $275 x 1181 = $309,775.
Response:  According to the passage, Lewis earned $133 during 19 weeks of harvest. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide the total amount he earned by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.
"Response:  If Lewis earned $2 per week during the harvest season and he earned a total of $178, then we can write an equation as follows:

$2 x number of weeks = $178

Now, we need to solve for the value of ""number of weeks"". To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $2:

number of weeks = $178 / $2

Simplifying, we get:

number of weeks = 89

Therefore, the harvest season lasted for 89 weeks."
"Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to go swimming. So, we can assume that Dean is standing in water with an initial depth of x feet (since he measures 9 feet tall). Then, since the water is 10 times deeper than Dean's height, we have:
x = 10 \* Dean's height
Now, we are asked how much more deep the water is compared to Dean's height. To find this, we subtract Dean's height from the previous equation:
Deepness of water = x - Dean's height
Substituting Dean's height as 9 feet gives us:
Deepness of water = x - 9
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 19 feet
Therefore, the water is approximately 19 feet deeper than Dean's height."
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is twice the height of Dean. So if Dean is x feet tall, then the depth of the water is 2x feet. Since Ron is 14 feet tall, we can say that Dean is y feet shorter than Ron. Therefore, the depth of the water is 2y feet. Now we have two equations: 2x = y + 8 and 2y = x - 8. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 6 and y = 4. So the depth of the water was 12 feet (2 times the height of Dean).
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 5 times the height of Ron. So if Ron is 12 feet tall, then the depth of the water would be 5 x 12 = 60 feet. Additionally, we are told that Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, so Dean is 12 - 11 = 1 foot tall. Therefore, the depth of the water is still 60 feet.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 15 times the height of Dean. So if Dean is x feet tall, then the depth of the water is 15x feet. Since Ron is 4 feet taller than Dean, we can say that Ron is (x + 4) feet tall. Now, according to the problem, the depth of the water is 15 times the height of Dean, so we can write an equation as follows: 15(x + 4) =????. Solving for x, we get x = 9 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water was 15(9 + 4) = 120 feet.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 16 times the height of Ron. So if Ron measures 13 feet tall, then the depth of the water would be 16 x 13 = 208 feet deep. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, we can add 9 feet to the previous answer, making it 217 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Dean is 6 feet more than Ron, so Dean is 15 + 6 = 21 feet tall. And we also know that the water is 9 times as deep as Dean's height. So if Dean is 21 feet tall and the water is 9 times deeper, then the depth of the water would be 9 x 21 = 189 feet.
Response:  If Bryan has 34 books and wants to distribute them equally among two shelves, then each shelf will have 34/2 = 17 books.
"Response:  If Bryan has a total of 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then he must have... See Answer
Let's think step by step. If Bryan has a total of 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then he must have at least 21 shelves (42 / 2 = 21)."
Response:  If Bryan has 27 books and each stanza has 80 magazines, then he has a total of 27 x 80 = 2160 magazines. Since we are asked how many books Bryan has in total, we can deduce that the number of books is equal to the number of magazines divided by 80. Therefore, Bryan has 2160 / 80 = 27 books in total.
Response:  If Bryan has 9 books in each of his 10 shelves, then he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. Now, if he has 46 magazines per shelf, and he has 10 shelves, then he has a total of 46 x 10 = 460 magazines. Therefore, Bryan has a total of 90 + 460 = 550 magazines.
Response:  If Bryan has 23 books and each stanza has 61 magazines, then he has a total of 23 + 61 = 84 books and magazines in all his shelves. Therefore, Bryan has 84 books and magazines in total.
Response:  If Bryan has 7 estanterías and each estantería contains the same number of books, then there are 7 x 7 = 49 books in all. Since he has 28 books in total, that means each estantería must contain 28 / 49 = 5.9 books. So, there are approximately 6 books in each estantería.
"Response:  If Bryan has 38 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then...

1. How many shelves does he have if he has 38 books? (Since each shelf can hold 2 books)

$ Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf $

$ Number of shelves = 38 / 2 $

$ Number of shelves = 19 $

Therefore, Bryan has 19 shelves."
Response:  If Carol wants to make sure that none of her 10 friends gets left without an invitation, she will need to buy at least $\frac{10}{2} = 5$ packages of invitations. So, the answer is $5$.
"Response:  Since Carol bought 3 packages of invitations and each package has the same number of invitations, we can say that there are 3 x Number of invitations in each package = Total number of invitations. So, if we know how many invitations are in each package, we can find out the total number of invitations Carol bought. 
So, the answer is 3 x Number of invitations in each package."
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packages of invitations and each package has 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations to give out. Since she only invited two friends, there are 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over.
Response:  We know that Carol bought 6 packages of invitations, each containing 14 invitations. Therefore, she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations to give out. Then, she purchased additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number of invitations to 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. So, Carol can invite up to 95 people to her party.
Response:  If Carol bought two packages of invitations that contain 3 invitations each, then she has a total of 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional invitations equal to the number of guests she wants to invite minus the number of invitations she already has. So, in this case, she needs to buy 3 more invitations (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played n games, then her total score is 12n. Since she scored a total of 36 points, we can set up the equation 12n = 36. Now, we need to solve for n. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 12: n = 36 / 12 = 3. So, Melissa played 3 games.
"Response:  If Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points, then she must have scored x points in each game, where x is a constant. So, we can write the equation:
x + x + x = 81... (1)
Now, we are asked to find out how many points Melissa scored in each game. To do this, we need to solve for x in equation (1). Can you do that?"
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each game and obtained additional 82 points in each game, then she scored a total of 109 + 82 = 191 points per game. Since there were 79 games played, Melissa scored a total of 191 x 79 = 14635 points.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points per game, then we can write this as: Total points = Number of games x Points per game So, if we want to find out how many games Melissa played, we need to solve for the variable ""Number of games"" in the equation above. We know that Total points = 21, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Number of games = Total points / Points per game = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games."
"Response:  If Melissa scored the same number of points in each game (91), then we can write the equation:
P = 91
Where P is the number of points Melissa scored in each game.
Now, we have to find out how many games Melissa played. From the question, we know that she played 13 games. So, we can set up another equation:
Number of games = Number of points scored
13 = P x 91
Solving for P, we get:
P = 13 / 91
P = 0.1457
Therefore, Melissa scored 0.1457 points in each game."
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride it at the same time, then each seat can accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5). Therefore, each seat can hold 5 people.
Response:  If each seat can hold 9 people and there are 18 people who can ride at once, then we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats are available for riding. So, the number of seats = 18/9 = 2. Therefore, the noria has 2 seats.
Response:  Each park has 3 norias (Paradise Park has 3 x 19 = 57 seats). So, each noria can accommodate 15 people x 3 = 45 people. Therefore, 20 norias can accommodate 20 x 45 = 850 people at the same time.
Response:  The total number of seats in the Ferris wheel is 18. Each seat can accommodate 15 people, so the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 18 x 15 = 270 people. Since 10 seats are broken, we have to subtract that amount from the total capacity, which gives us 270 - 10 = 260 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.
Response:  The park has 6 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 14 people, so the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, we cannot add more than 84 - 16 = 68 additional people to it. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can join the Ferris wheel is 68.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can sit in the small seats. Now, each large seat can accommodate 54 people, so we have 23 x 54 = 1206 people who can mount the Ferris wheel in total. Therefore, the answer is 1206.
Response:  The total number of small seats = 3. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, so the total number of people who can sit in small seats = 3 x 16 = 48 people. Now, let's find out how many big seats are available. The total number of big seats = 7. Each big seat can accommodate 12 people, so the total number of people who can sit in big seats = 7 x 12 = 84 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can mount the Ferris wheel (big and small seats combined) = 48 + 84 = 132 people.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once and it has 4 seats per car, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people each seat can hold. So, the answer is 4.
"Response:  If 4 people can ride at once, and each seat has space for 2 people, then...

Step-by-step calculation:
1. Number of seats = number of riders / number of riders per seat
= 4 / 2
= 2
Therefore, the noria has 2 seats."
Response:  If there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then there will be 7 x Number of slices = Total number of slices. Since there are 14 slices in total, we can set up an equation as follows: 7x = 14. Solving for x, we get x = 2. Therefore, each pizza has 2 slices.
Response:  If each pizza has 2 rebanadas and we asked for some pizzas (pedimos), then the number of pizzas = Total number of rebanadas / Number of rebanadas in each pizza. In this case, the total number of rebanadas is 28, so if there are 2 rebanadas in each pizza, we can calculate the number of pizzas as follows: Number of pizzas = 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas. Therefore, we asked for 14 pizzas.
Response:  If we have 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Since there are 25 people, each person will get approximately 2.6 slices (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the total number of rebanadas of pizza is 68 / 2.6 = 26 rebanadas.
Response:  If we have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are 2 people, we need to divide the total number of slices equally between them, which means each person will get 45 slices (90 / 2).
"Response:  If Paige and her mom planted 10 seeds in each of 45 flower pots, then...
Step 1: How many seedlings will there be if all 10 seeds germinate?
There are 45 flower pots, and each pot has 10 seeds. So, the total number of seeds is 45 x 10 = 450 seeds.
Step 2: What percentage of seeds have germinated if only 3 of them have grown into seedlings?
If 3 seedlings grew out of 450 seeds (which is 3/450 or 0.067), then the percentage of seeds that have germinated is 0.067.
So, Paige and her mom planted 450 seeds in total. Of those, 3 germinated to become seedlings, which means they planted 3/450 = 0.067 seedlings per flower pot."
Response:  If they planted the same number of seeds in each patch, then the number of seeds they planted in one patch is equal to the total number of seeds divided by the number of patches. So if they planted 45 seeds and there are 9 patches, then the number of seeds they planted in each patch is 45/9 = 5 seeds. Therefore, they planted 5 seeds in each patch.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. Since they only had 12 seedlings per maceta, we can calculate how many macetas were needed to hold all of the seedlings as follows: Number of macetas = Total number of seedlings / Number of seedlings per maceta = 36 / 12 = 3 macetas So, there were 3 macetas in total.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in each pot, so they had 55/15 = 3.73 pots with seeds. Since only 60 seeds grew in each pot, we can calculate how many pots have at least one seed growing as follows: 60/3.73 = 16.49 pots. So, Paige and her mom cultivated 16 or more pots of flowers.
"Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 60 seeds in total. If they planted 10 seeds in each of 6 macets, then...

$ $60 \div 10 = 6$ macets

Therefore, there were 6 macets."
Response:  If Paige and her mom are planting flowers in 8 gardens, then they must have planted half of the seeds (16) in each garden. So, if they planted the same number of seeds in each garden, then they planted 4 seeds in each garden. Therefore, Paige and her mom planted a total of 4 x 8 = 32 seeds.
Response:  If Matthew had x galletas initially and gave 2 galletas to each of his 11 friends, then he would have given a total of 2x galletas. Since he still has some galletas left after giving them away, we can say that x = 36 (the number of galletas Matthew had initially). So, Matthew had 36 galletas initially.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 galletas to give away and he gave 2 galletas to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 8 / 2 = 4 friends galletas. Therefore, Matthew gave galletas to 4 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 cookies and gave an equal number to each of his 5 friends, then he gave away 15 x 5 = 75 cookies in total. So, if he still has 10 cookies left after giving them away, that means he must have given each friend 75 / 5 = 15 cookies. Therefore, each friend got 15 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 cookies and gave them to his three friends, then he would have given away 24 / 3 = 8 cookies to each friend. So, Matthew gave 8 cookies to each of his 3 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 galletas and 34 pastries, in total he had 56 sweets (22 + 34). If he gave the same amount to his 11 friends, then each friend received 5 sweets (56 / 11 = 5). So, each person consumed 5 galletas.
"Response:  If Matthew had 29 galletas and 30 pasteles, then he gave each of his 2 friends an equal amount of both candies. So, if x is the number of pasteles that each friend got, we can write the equation:
Matthew had 29 galletas + 30 pasteles = 2x pasteles (since each friend got x pasteles)
Now, let's solve for x:
29 + 30 = 2x
Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:
29 = 2x - 30
Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:
-19 = -30
This means that there are no possible values of x that satisfy the equation. Therefore, none of Matthew's friends received any pastelles."
"Response:  If Matthew had 14 galletas and 21 pasteles in total, then he gave each of his 7 friends an equal amount (since he divided them equally). So, if x is the number of galletas or pasteles that Matthew gave to one friend, we can write:
x = 14/7 = 2
Therefore, each person got 2 galletas and 2 pasteles from Matthew."
Response:  If Matthew had 36 galletas and divided them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would get 2 galletas (36/18 = 2). So, each person consumed 2 galletas.
Response:  If Matthew gave 6 galletas to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 6 x 5 = 30 galletas to all his friends together. So, he had 36 - 30 = 6 galletas left after giving them out. Therefore, he gave galletas to 5 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 galletas and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 23/2 = 11 galletas to each friend. So each friend got 11 galletas.
Response:  If Matthew had 31 galletas and gave away an equal number to his 5 friends, then he would have given away 31 / 5 = 6 galletas to each friend. So, Matthew gave away 6 x 5 = 30 galletas to his friends. Therefore, after giving them galletas, Matthew has 31 - 30 = 1 galta left.
"Response:  If Mateo gave each of his friends an equal amount of both galletas and pasteles, then he must have given them in proportion to their respective shares initially. So, if A, B, C, and D are the four friends, we can write:
Galletas initial = (Number of friends) x (Initial number of galletas) = 4 x 32 = 128
Pasteles initial = (Number of friends) x (Initial number of pasteles) = 4 x 98 = 392
Now, let's assume that Mateo gave each friend an equal amount of both galletes and pasteles. Therefore, the total number of galletes and pasteles received by each friend is proportional to their initial share. So, we can write:
Galletas received = Galletes initial / Number of friends = 128 / 4 = 32
Pasteles received = Pasteles initial / Number of friends = 392 / 4 = 98
Therefore, each person received 32 galletas and 98 pasteles."
"Response:  If Matthew had initially 10 galletas and 8 pasteles, and he gave an equal amount to his 4 friends, then the number of pasteles each friend received is also equal to the total number of pasteles Matthew had initially. Therefore, the number of pastelles each friend received is:
Pastelles = Total Pastelles / Number of Friends = 8 / 4 = 2
So, each friend received 2 pastelles from Matthew."
"Response:  If Mateo gave out the same amount of cookies and cakes to his 28 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of both cookies and cakes. So, if x is the number of cookies Mateo gave to each friend, then the number of cakes he gave to each friend is also x. Since there are 13 cookies and 15 cakes initially, we can write the equation:
x + x = 28 (cookies)
x + x = 28 (cakes)
Simplifying the equations, we get:
2x = 53
x = 26.5
So, Mateo gave each friend 26.5 cookies and 26.5 cakes."
"Response:  We know that Debby drank 109 bottles per day and the water lasted for 74 days. So we can write an equation:

109 = x / 74
Where ""x"" is the number of bottles Debby bought.
Now we solve for ""x"":

x = 109 × 74 = 8260
So Debby had bought 8260 bottles of water."
"Response:  If Debby drank the same amount each day and there were initially 153 bottles, then she must have drunk all those bottles in 17 days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of bottles = Total number of bottles / Number of days

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Number of bottles = 153 / 17 = 9

So, Debby drank 9 bottles every day for 17 days."
"Response:  If Debby bought 264 bottles of water when they were on sale and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows:

Days = 11
Bottles drunk/day = 15
Total bottles drunk = Days x Bottles drunk/day = 11 x 15 = 165

So, Debby has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles of water left."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 301 bottles of water and drank 144 in some days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of bottles drunk = 144
Total number of bottles = 301

Now, we want to find out how many days Debby drank water for. To do this, we divide the number of bottles she drank by the number of bottles she had left:

Days = Number of bottles drunk / Total number of bottles
= 144 / 157
= 9

Therefore, Debby drank water for 9 days."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were on sale. If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days will last her supply of water as follows:

Days = Number of bottles / Daily consumption
= 88 / 4
= 22
Therefore, Debby's supply of water will last for 22 days."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they were on sale. If she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days will last her supply of soda as follows:

Total amount of soda = Number of bottles x Amount per bottle
= 256 x $1.50 (assuming each bottle costs $1.50)
= $384

Now, let's divide the total amount of soda by the number of days Debby will consume it to find out how long her supply will last:

Days until soda runs out = Total amount / Daily consumption
= $384 / 316 (since she consumes 312 bottles of water + 4 bottles of soda per day)
= 11.79 days

Therefore, if Debby continues to drink at this rate, her supply of soda will last for approximately 11.79 days."
Response:  If Debby drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she bought a total of 12 bottles of water, then she has enough water for 12/6 = 2 days. Therefore, Debby's supply of water will last her for 2 days.
Response:  We know that Debby bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water. If she drinks 15 bottles of water per day, then in one day, she will consume 15/95 = 0.1625 bottles of water. Similarly, if she drinks 54 bottles of soda per day, then in one day, she will consume 54/180 = 0.3067 bottles of soda. Since we want to find out how many days the water lasts, we need to divide the total number of bottles of water by the number of bottles consumed per day: Number of days = Total bottles of water / Number of bottles consumed per day = 180 / 0.1625 = 111.33 days Therefore, the water will last for approximately 111.33 days.
Response:  We know that Debby bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water. If she drinks 122 bottles of water per day, then there are 122 - 122 = 0 bottles of water left. Now we have to calculate how many days will last the remaining soda bottles. So, let's divide the number of soda bottles by the number of days Debby drank water: 360 / 122 = 3 days. Therefore, the soda bottles will last for 3 days.
Response:  Since there are 14 rows and each row has 11 pens, then the total number of pens is 14 x 11 = 154 pens. Therefore, Faye has 154 pens in total.
Response:  Since there are 12 lápices in total and Faye wants to place them in an equitable way, we can assume that each row will have 4 lápices (since 12 divided by 3 is 4). So, Faye placed 4 lápices in each of the 3 rows. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Since Faye has 28 packages of pencils and each package contains 24 pencils, she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Since she wants to place them in rows, we need to divide this number by the number of pencils she can place in each row, which is 16 pencils per row. Therefore, the number of rows Faye could make is 672 / 16 = 43 rows.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 22 lápices in each row and she has 6 packages of lápices with 14 lápices in each package. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of lápices = Number of rows x Number of lápices per row + Number of packages x Number of lápices per package

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of lápices = 22 x 3 + 6 x 14
= 70 + 84
= 154

Therefore, Faye has 154 lápices in total."
Response:  If Faye has 35 lápices and wants to place them in rows of 5 each, she will need 7 rows (since there are 7 crayons). So, the number of rows Faye can make is 7.
Response:  Since there are 19 rows and each row has 4 pens, then the total number of pens is 19 x 4 = 76 pens. Now, since there are 27 crayons in each row, so the total number of crayons are 27 x 19 = 503 crayons. Therefore, the total number of pens and crayons together are 76 + 503 = 579.
Response:  We know that there are 7 rows and each row has 36 pens (or pencils). Therefore, the total number of pens is 7 x 36 = 252 pens. Now, we need to find out how many crayons Faye has. According to the question, she has 30 crayons in each of the 7 rows, which means she has a total of 30 x 7 = 210 crayons. So, the final answer is 252 + 210 = 462 crayons.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 rows and each row has 31 pens and 27 pencils. Therefore, we have:
Total number of pens = 11 x 31 = 331
Total number of pencils = 11 x 27 = 297
So, in total, Faye has 331 pens and 297 pencils."
Response:  Since there are 30 lápices in total and each row has 5 lápices, we can divide 30 by 5 to find out how many rows Faye could make: 30 / 5 = 6. So, Faye could make 6 rows with 5 lápices in each row.
Response:  If Faye had 6 lápices and wanted to place them in 2 filas, then she would have placed 3 lápices in each row. Therefore, the number of lápices placed in each row is 3.
"Response:  Since each package has 4 pencils and Faye wants to place them in rows with 2 pencils per row, we can start by dividing the total number of pencils (35) by the number of pencils in each row (2). So, the number of rows she could make is:
35 / 2 = 17
Therefore, Faye could make 17 rows with her 35 pencils."
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packages of pencils and each package contains 6 pencils. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Now, we are told that she is placing her pencils in rows with 19 pencils in each row. Therefore, the number of rows she can make is 186 / 19 = 9 rows. So, Faye has 9 rows of pencils, which means she has 9 x 19 = 171 pencils in total.
Response:  We know that there are 30 rows and each row has 71 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons is 30 x 71 = 2130. Now, we need to find out how many lápices Faye has. According to the question, each row has 24 lápices, so the total number of lápices is 24 x 30 = 640. Therefore, Faye has 640 lápices in total.
Response:  Since there are 16 rows and each row has 6 crayons, then the total number of crayons is 16 x 6 = 96. And since there are 21 lápices in each row, the total number of lápices is 21 x 16 = 320. Therefore, Faye has 96 crayons and 320 lápices.
"Response:  Since there are 21 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an average of 9 students (which is close to the actual number given), we can assume that all classrooms will be able to go on the field trip. Therefore, the total number of students who can attend the field trip = Total number of classrooms x Number of students per classroom = 21 x 9 = 189 students.
Since there are 7 buses available for the field trip, the maximum number of students each bus can carry = Total number of students / Number of buses = 189 / 7 = 26 students per bus."
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and each class has an average of 30 students (this is just for calculation purposes). So, we have:
Number of classes = 84
Average number of students per class = 30
Now, let's calculate how many students will be going on the field trip:
Total number of students in all classes = Number of classes x Average number of students per class
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
But wait! The question says that 95 buses are fully loaded with 118 seats each. So, if we divide the total number of students by the number of buses, we get:
Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 2520 students / 95 buses
= 26.7 students per bus
So, approximately 26-27 students will be going on the field trip from each bus."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in total at the school and each class has 66 students, so we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4320 students attending the school. Since there are 6 seats available per bus, we need to divide the number of students by 6 to find out how many buses we need: 4320 / 6 = 720 buses needed for the trip.
"Response:  Since there are 87 classes in total and each class has the same number of students (let's call it x), then we can write an equation:

Number of classes = Number of students/Number of students per class

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

87 = x/58

Now, since there are 2 seats available in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available in each bus:

Total number of students / Total number of seats in each bus = Number of buses needed

Substituting the values, we get:

87 / 2 =?

Therefore, the answer is 43.5 buses needed for the trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in total because there are 24 aulas at the school. Each class has the same number of students since each aula has the same number of students. Therefore, we can write:
Number of classes = Number of aulas x Number of students per aula
= 24 x 120
= 2880
Now, we know that there are 84 seats available on each bus. Since each class goes to the excursion together, we must divide the total number of students by the number of buses:
Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 2880 / 84
= 35
Therefore, there are approximately 35 students in each class."
Response:  We know that there are 66 classes in the school and each class has 30 students (on average). So, we have 66 x 30 = 1980 students in total. Since only 102 students want to go on the field trip, this means that 1980 - 102 = 1878 students will not be going on the field trip. Now, since there are 8 seats available per bus, we need to divide the number of non-going students by 8 to find out how many buses we need: 1878 / 8 = 231 buses. Therefore, we need 231 buses for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classes in the school and each class has 11 students. So, we have 102 x 11 = 1122 students in total at the school. Now, we also know that 8 students do not want to go on the trip, so let's subtract them from the total number of students: 1122 - 8 = 1114 students will be going on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students. So, we have 72 x 3 = 216 students attending the excursion. Since there is only one bus for every 3 students, we need at least 216 / 3 = 72 buses to transport all the students. Therefore, we need 72 buses for the trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 classes in the school and each class has an average of 30 students (which is not necessarily true but for simplicity let's assume it). So, we have:
Number of classes = 17
Average number of students per class = 30
Total number of students in the school = Number of classes x Average number of students per class
= 17 x 30
= 510 students
Now, we know that there are 46 buses available for the excursion and since all the buses will be full, we can assume that each bus can carry approximately half of the total number of students (again, this is just an assumption, but it should give us a good estimate). Therefore, we can calculate the number of seats available on each bus as follows:
Number of seats on each bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 510 / 46
= 11 seats per bus
So, if all the buses are full, there are approximately 11 seats available on each bus."
"Response:  If there are 11 children in total and each child gets 9 canicas, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of canicas needed for all the children together: 11 children x 9 canicas per child = 99 canicas.

So, Haley had 99 canicas in total!"
Response:  If there are 5 chicks and each one received 5 canicas, then... (10 - 5) = 5 canicas left for Haley. So, she gave canicas to 5 children.
Response:  If there are 4 children and they all like to play with marbles, then each child will receive 23/4 = 5.75 marbles from Haley. Since you cannot have a fraction of a marble, each child will receive 6 marbles (round up). Therefore, Haley will give 6 - 15 = -9 marbles to each child.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing cards and they want to share equally among themselves, each boy will receive 50/13 = 4 cards. Therefore, each of them will receive 4 cards.
"Response:  If Haley has 20 canicas and there are 2 children in her class who like to play with canicas, then each child will receive how many canicas?
We know that 20 / 2 = 10 canicas per child. Therefore, each child will receive 10 canicas from Haley."
"Response:  If some boys like playing with marbles and Haley gives each of them 2 marbles, then...

Step 1: How many marbles does Haley have initially?
Answer: According to the question, Haley has 28 marbles initially.

Step 2: How many marbles will each boy get from Haley?
Answer: Each boy will get 2 marbles from Haley.

Step 3: How many marbles will there be in total after Haley gives them away?
Answer: After Haley gives the marbles away, there will be 28 - 2 = 26 marbles left.

Therefore, Haley gave marbles to 26 boys."
Response:  If Frank was reading his favorite book for x days and it had 392 pages, then he read 14 pages per day. So, in one day, he covered 14 pages of the book. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 392 / 14 = x days. Therefore, Frank took x days to finish his book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his book for 569 days and each day he read 22 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, we need to fill in the values given in the question: Number of pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, the book has 12380 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish the book, so he read for x number of hours per day. Since there are 24 chapters in the book, each chapter takes y pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x = (612 / 24) \* y
Now, we need to solve for y. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by x:
y = (612 / x)
Now, we have found the value of y. Substituting it back into our original equation, we get:
x = (612 / y)
So, Frank read at a rate of x pages per day."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading his book, and since there are 5 chapters in total, each chapter must have taken him approximately 44 days (220 / 5 = 44). Now, we need to divide the number of pages in each chapter by the time it took Frank to read one chapter to find out how many pages were in each chapter. So, if each chapter has 555 pages, then: 
(Number of pages per chapter) x (Time taken to read one chapter) = (Total number of pages in each chapter) 
(555 pages/chapter) x (44 days) = 23,690 pages 
Therefore, there are approximately 23,690 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish his book and it has 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can use the formula: Number of chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Time taken to complete the book. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of chapters read per day = 15 / 660 = 0.024 (or approximately 1 chapter per day)
Response:  Since each book had 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish each one, he read a total of 746 pages (249 x 3). So, he read 746 / 3 = 248 pages per day.
Response:  We know that each book has 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish one book. Therefore, he finished all books in 492 days = (492 x 12) / 66 = 75 books. So, Frank read 75 books.
Response:  We know that it took Frank 16 days to finish his book and we also know that the book had 112 pages. So, if he read for x number of days, then the total number of pages he read is equal to the number of pages in the book multiplied by x. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Book length x Days spent reading Now, we are asked to find out how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of pages he read (which we found earlier) by the number of days he spent reading. So, we have: Number of pages/Days spent reading = Total number of pages / Number of days spent reading Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pages/Days spent reading = 112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his book every day.
Response:  If Frank read 8 pages per day and the book had 576 pages, then he took X days to finish the book. We can write an equation as follows: 576 = 8x Where x is the number of days it took Frank to finish the book. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 8: 576 / 8 = x Solving for x, we get: x = 72 So Frank took 72 days to finish his favorite book.
Response:  Since there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages, the total number of pages in the book is: 41 x 450 = 17,650 pages. Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. We know that it took him 30 days to finish the book, so he must have read a certain number of pages every day. To find this out, divide the total number of pages in the book (17,650) by the number of days it took Frank to finish the book (30): 17,650 / 30 = 589 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 589 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish his book, and each chapter has 594 pages. So, we can calculate the number of chapters as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of pages per chapter Chapter length = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Therefore, we have: Number of chapters = 3 x 594 = 1782 Number of chapters = 1782 / 594 = 3 And so, there are 3 chapters in Frank's book, with each chapter containing 594 pages.
Response:  Since each chapter has 405 pages and there are two chapters, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Pages per chapter = 2 x 405 = 810 pages. Now, let's find out how many days it took Frank to read the book: Days taken = Total pages / Number of pages read per day = 810 / 664 = 1.23 days. So, Frank read approximately 1.23 chapters per day.
"Response:  If we can buy 6 packages of DVDs with $120, then the cost of each package is:
$120 / 6 = $20 per package
Therefore, each package costs $20."
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages will cost:
$81 x 33 = $2693
Therefore, it will cost $2693 to buy 33 packages of DVDs."
"Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 in each package, then we can calculate the price of one package as follows:
$107 - ($106 x number of packages) = remaining cost per package
We want to know how many packages we can buy with $93, so let's divide the remaining cost per package by $93:
Number of packages = remaining cost per package / $93
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Number of packages = ($107 - ($106 x number of packages)) / $93
Simplifying and solving for number of packages, we get:
number of packages = $93 / ($107 - ($106 x number of packages))
Now, we are asked to find out how many packages we can buy with $93. So, we need to solve for number of packages in the above equation:
number of packages = $93 / ($107 - ($106 x number of packages))
Solving for number of packages, we get:
number of packages = $93 / ($107 - $106)
= $93 / $1
= 93
Therefore, you can buy 93 packages of DVDs with $93."
Response:  The cost of each package is $76, and there is a discount of $25 in each package. To find out how much you have to pay for each package, we can use the following equation: Cost = Price - Discount. So, Cost = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each package.
"Response:  If you have $104 dollars and each package of DVDs costs $26, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many packages of DVDs you can buy with your money.
$104 / $26 = 4 packages of DVDs
So, you can buy 4 packages of DVDs with $104."
Response:  If we have $28 to buy two packages of DVDs, then each package costs $\$14$.
Response:  If there are 18 plums in Philip's collection and they need to be organized into groups of size 2, then we can divide them equally among 9 groups. Therefore, the number of groups is 9.
Response:  If there are some bananas in Philip's collection of plums and each group of size 187 contains only plums, then... (1/2) 
Response:  We know that there are 203 plátanos in total and they are organized into 7 groups. Therefore, we can say that each group contains an equal number of plátanos (i.e., 203 / 7 = x). Now, let's find out how many plátanos are in each group. So, we divide the total number of plátanos by the number of groups: x = 203 / 7 = 28.5 (round off to 29). Thus, each group of plátanos has approximately 29 plátanos.
"Response:  We know that there are 142 plátanos and 356 naranjas in total. If we divide the number of naranjas (356) by the number of groups they are organized into (178), we get:

Number of naranjas per group = 356 / 178 = 2
So each group of naranjas contains 2 naranjas."
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and we want to find out how many bananas each group contains. So, let's divide the total number of bananas (392) by the number of groups (196):

392 / 196 = 2

So, each group in Philip's collection contains an average of 2 bananas."
"Response:  If there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 18, then we can divide them as follows:

180 / 18 = 10 groups

So, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 plátanos in total and they will be organized into two groups. So, we have 290 / 2 = 145 plátanos in each group.
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in total. Since the bananas are organized into 345 groups, we can say that each group contains $ \frac {345}{192} = 1.77$ bananas on average. Similarly, since the oranges are organized into 16 groups, we can say that each group contains $\frac {16}{384} = 0.043$ oranges on average. So, each orange is part of approximately $0.043$ groups.  
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 38 galletas and each one of them had 19 galletas inside, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many galletas are in total. We have 38 galletas x 19 galletas per galette = 726 galletas.
So, Brenda's mother prepared galletas for 726 invitees."
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made galletas for 14 people and each person had 30 galletas, then...

Step 1: How many total galletas did Brenda's mother make?
Total number of galletas = Number of people x Number of galletas per person
= 14 x 30
= 420 galletas

Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 420 galletas."
Response:  If Brenda's mother made galletas for 5 people and prepared 22 in total, that means she had 22 / 5 = 4 galletas per person. Since she had to throw away 17 galletas, each person got 4 - 17 = -13 galletas. So, there were no galletas left for anyone.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made gallets for 10 guests and only 9 came, then she must have prepared more than enough to feed them all. So, let x be the number of galletes she prepared. Since each guest had an equal amount of galletes (18 in total), we can write the equation:
x/10 = 18
Solving for x, we get:
x = 180
So, each guest got 18 galletes."
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 galletas for 2 guests, then each guest received 7 galletas (since 14 divided by 2 is 7). So, each guest had 7 galletas.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 10 galletas in total and each guest received 2 galletas, then...

Step 1: How many guests did Brenda's mother prepare galletas for?
Number of guests = Total number of galletas / Number of galletes per guest
= 10 / 2
= 5 guests

Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared galletas for 5 guests."
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he puts them equally in two bags, then each bag will have 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy. Therefore, there are 21 pieces of candy in each bag.
Response:  If Frank had 26 bags of candy and each bag contained 33 pieces of candy, then he had a total of... (1) x 33 = 780 pieces of candy. Therefore, Frank had 780 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  If Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them, he would have 9 + 9 = 18 remaining pieces of candy. Since he wants to put these in bags with 9 pieces each, he will need 18 / 9 = 2 bags. Therefore, Frank has 2 bags of candy.
"Response:  If Frank has 22 pieces of candy and he puts 11 pieces in each bag, then...

Step 1: How many bags can he make with 22 pieces of candy?

22 / 11 = 2 bags

So, Frank can make 2 bags with 22 pieces of candy.

Therefore, the answer is 2 bags."
Response:  If Frank put equal number of pieces in each bag, then we can say that if there are x pieces of candy in one bag, there will be x/2 pieces of candy in the other bag. So, if there were initially 16 pieces of candy, and Frank divided them equally between two bags, then there would be 8 pieces of candy in each bag (16 / 2 = 8).
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 cajas of Trefoils, then she needs to deliver 25 x 14 = 350 cajas of Trefoils. Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 350 cajas of Trefoils.
Response:  If Shirley sold 10 cajas of galletas Trefoils, then there are 10 cajas in total. To find out how many cajas are in each stash, we need to divide the total number of cajas by the number of stashes she needs to deliver. So if she needs to deliver 5 stashes, then there are 10/5 = 2 cajas in each stash. Therefore, there are 2 cajas in each stash.
"Response:  We know that there are 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Regular Soda = 67
Diet Soda = 9
Now, let's solve for the number of regular sodas:
Regular Soda = Diet Soda / (1 + Diet Soda)
= 9 / (1 + 0.9)
= 9 / 1.9
= 5
So, there were 5 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of both types is equal to 83 (22 + 61). So, if we have x bottles of regular refreshments and y bottles of dietetic refreshments, then we can write the equation:
x + y = 83...(1)
Now, we are asked how many more dietetic refreshments they had than regular ones. So, let z be the difference between these two quantities:
z = y - x
Substituting this value in equation (1), we get:
x + y = 83...(1)
x + (y - z) = 83...(2)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we can add equations (1) and (2):
x + y = 83...(1)
x + (y - z) = 83...(2)
x + y = 83
x + y - z = 83
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
2x + y = 83
Now, dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x + y = 41.5
So, there were 41.5 bottles of regular refreshments and 40.5 bottles of dietetic refreshments."
Response:  The store had 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of dietetic soda, so in total they have 30 + 8 = 38 bottles of soda. Additionally, there were 41 apples, which are not counted as bottles. Therefore, the final answer is 38 bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda. So far, we have a total of 132 bottles (79 + 53). Now, let's find out how many more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles there are: Number of regular soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles = 79 - 53 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles in the store.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. So, if we subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of bottles, we get...

54 + 83 = 137

So, the number of regular bottles is 137 - 54 = 83. Therefore, the number of regular bottles is 83 more than the number of diet bottles."
Response:  We know that there are 17 botellas in total and 9 of them are regular refrescos (botellas). So, the number of dietetic bottles is equal to 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, they have 8 botellas de refresco dietético.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of bottles of regular soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of diet soda

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of bottles of regular soda = 60 - 19
= 41

Therefore, there were 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  The total number of bottles is 72 + 32 = 104 botellas. Since there are 78 manzanas, we need to subtract the number of botellas from the total number of manzanas to find out how many more manzanas they have. So, the answer is 104 - 78 = 26 botellas more manzanas.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 manzanas and 80 botellas of regular refresco. So, we have:
Manzanas = 36
Regular refresco = 80
Now, we also know that there are 54 botellas of dietetic refresco. So, we can subtract the number of botellas of regular refresco from the total number of botellas to find out how many more botellas of dietetic refresco they had:
Total botellas - Regular refresco botellas = Dietetic refresco botellas
124 (total botellas) - 80 (regular refresco botellas) = 44 (dietetic refresco botellas)
Therefore, the store had 44 more botellas of dietetic refresco than manzanas."
Response:  We know that there are 30 botellas in total and 28 of them are regular refrescos. So, the number of dietetic refreshes is 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 botellas of dietetic refreshment.
Response:  We know that the store had 4 bottles of dietetic soda and 79 more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda. So, if we have x bottles of dietetic soda, then the total number of bottles of soda = x + 79. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular soda = x + 79 - 4 = x + 75.
Response:  The store had 57 bottles of regular soda, which is equal to 57/1 = 57 botellas. Then, it had 26 botellas of diet soda, which is equal to 26/1 = 26 botellas. Finally, it had 27 botellas of light soda, which is equal to 27/1 = 27 botellas. Therefore, in total, the store had 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 botellas.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. So, if we subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas, we get: 81 - 60 = 21. Therefore, the store has more than twice as many regular sodas as they do diet sodas.
Response:  The store had 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda. So in total, they have 49 + 40 = 89 bottles of soda.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors yesterday and today there are 317 visitors, then the difference between the number of visitors today and yesterday is:

317 - 295 = 22

So, 22 more people visited the Palace of Buckingham today than yesterday."
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before and after eating an abundant meal they went to see it, then in 25 days there would be:

703 + (246 x 25) =...

So, the answer is:

703 + 5900 =...

Therefore, the answer is 6603 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in 25 days."
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day after Rachel and her friends had their big meal, then there must have been more than 666 visitors that day compared to the previous day. So, we can say:

Number of visitors yesterday = 666 + x
Where x is the number of additional visitors today.
We are told that Rachel learned this information after eating a big meal, so let's call the time when she learned it T.
Now, we need to find out how many days have passed between the time when Rachel and her friends had their big meal and the time they visited the Palace of Buckingham. Let's assume that this time interval is t days.
Then, we can write:

Number of visitors yesterday = 666 + x
= (666 + x) - t
Since we know that there were 100 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day after Rachel and her friends had their big meal, we can set up the equation:

(666 + x) - t = 100
Solving for x, we get:
x = 466
So, there were 466 additional visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel and her friends had their big meal compared to the previous day."
"Response:  We know that in the last 327 days, there have been 406 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham. So, if we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (132) from this total, we get:

406 - 132 = 274

Therefore, there were 274 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day before the day of the question."
"Response:  We know that in the last 85 days, 829 people visited the palace. And today, after eating an abundant meal, they went to see the Palace of Buckingham. So, if 45 visitors came yesterday, then the number of visitors today is equal to the total number of visitors minus the number of visitors yesterday. 
$$ NumberOfVisitorsToday = TotalNumberOfVisitors - NumberOfVisitorsYesterday $$
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
$$ NumberOfVisitorsToday = 829 - 45 $$
Simplifying and solving for $NumberOfVisitorsToday$, we get:
$$ NumberOfVisitorsToday = 784 $$
Therefore, 784 people visited the Palace of Buckingham that day."
"Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings in the Palace of Buckingham and that 557 visitors came to see it that day. If we assume that the number of visitors per day is constant, then the total number of visitors over 57 days would be:

Total visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days
= 557 x 57
= 30,929
Therefore, there were approximately 30,929 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham over 57 days."
"Response:  If there were 600 visitors the day before and 39 paintings in the palace, then the number of visitors per painting is:

600 / 39 = 15.4 (visitors per painting)
Now, let's find out how many more visitors came to the palace that day than the previous day:

Difference between current visitors (661) and yesterday's visitors (600):

661 - 600 = 61
So, 61 more visitors came to the palace that day than the previous day."
"Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham after Rachel and her friends had eaten dinner. So, we can say that the number of visitors before them was equal to the total number of visitors minus the number of visitors after them. 
Using the information given in the question, we have:
Total number of visitors = 419 + 103 + 92 = 614
Therefore, the number of visitors who visited the Palace of Buckingham before Rachel and her friends arrived is 614 - 92 = 522."
"Response:  We know that there were 512 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel had her rich meal. If we assume that the number of visitors has increased by 100 each day (since there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that), then the number of visitors to the palace over the last 89 days can be calculated as follows:
Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2: 571 visitors (increase of 100)
Day 3: 671 visitors (increase of 100)
...
Day 89: 1089 visitors (increase of 100 for 89 days)
Therefore, the total number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham over the last 89 days is 1089."
"Response:  If there were 705 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham that day and the previous day had 191 visitors, then the total number of visitors in the past 2 days is:

705 + 191 = 896

If the total number of visitors in the past 3 days is:

896 + 457 = 1353

So, the difference between the number of visitors on that day and the average number of visitors over the previous 245 days is:

1353 - (245 x avg daily visitors) = 1353 - (245 x 191/245) = 1353 - 47,775 = -46,422

Therefore, more people visited the Palace of Buckingham that day than in the previous 245 days."
"Response:  We know that the person needs 159 more grams of wax to complete their task. If they already have 628 grams of wax, then we can calculate how much more they need as follows:

159 g - 628 g = -469 g

So, the person has -469 grams of wax (or negative 469 grams)."
"Response:  We know that the person needs 49g of colors to paint the feathers and they already have 260g of wax. So, we can calculate how much more wax is needed as follows:

Total amount of wax required = Amount of wax already available + Amount of wax needed for painting
= 260g + (49g x number of feathers)

Since there are 3 feathers in total, we need 16x amount of wax for each feather. Therefore, the amount of wax needed for all three feathers is:

Amount of wax needed for each feather = Total amount of wax required / Number of feathers
= 260g / 3
= 87g

So, the person currently has 260g of wax and needs an additional 87g to complete the task."
Response:  We know that the person needs 57g of colors to paint the feathers and 22g more of wax for gluing them together. So, they need a total of 57 + 22 = 79g of wax. Since each feather requires 353g of wax, the number of feathers is 353 / 35 = 10 feathers. Therefore, the person already has 10 x 22 = 220g of wax.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of cera needed is 166 g and currently they have 20 g. So we need to find out how much more cera do they need. To do this, we can divide the total amount of cera needed (166 g) by the amount of cera they already have (20 g):

166 g - 20 g = 146 g

So, they need an additional 146 grams of cera."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required is 17g and Sarah has already used 557g of wax. So, to find out how much wax she needs left, we can subtract the amount she has used from the total amount needed:

17g - 557g = -0.324g

So, Sarah needs -0.324g of wax left."
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required is 492g and currently, she has 11g of wax. So, we need to find out how many times 11g can be multiplied to get 492g. Multiplying 11g by 43 gives us 463g, which means she needs an additional 29g of wax. Therefore, the answer is 29g more wax needed.
Response:  We know that there are 90 tambores of uva in total and they take 6 days to fill them. So, we can calculate the number of tambores filled per day as follows: Number of tambores filled/Number of days = 90/6 = 15 tambores/day.
"Response:  If 266 collectors fill 90 barrels in 5 days, then...
Step 1: How many collectors are there?
Number of collectors = Total number of collectors / Number of barrels filled per day
= 266 / 90
= 3
Therefore, each day, 3 collectors will fill 3 x 90 = 270 barrels with grapes."
Response:  We know that in one day, 294 collectors fill 244 barrels of grapes and 47 barrels of strawberries. So, if we want to find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled in 146 days, we can multiply the number of collectors per day by the number of days: 294 x 146 = 43,084 barrels of grapes.
"Response:  We know that in one day, 221 tambores of uvas are filled. So, if they continue to fill them at this rate for 77 days, then...

Step-by-step calculation:

Day 1: 221 tambores of uvas filled
Day 2: 221 tambores of uvas filled (no change)
Day 3: 221 tambores of uvas filled (no change)
...
Day 77: 221 tambores of uvas filled (no change)

Therefore, the total number of tambores of uvas filled in 77 days is:
221 tambores/day x 77 days = 16,477 tambores of uvas filled

So, there would be 16,477 tambores of uvas filled in 77 days."
"Response:  If he saved his favorite videos after 57 stops and there are 252 collectors who fill 108 drums of grapes per day, then in 58 days...

Step-by-step calculation:

Day 1 to 57: No review of favorite videos, so no change in number of drums filled.
Day 58: He starts reviewing his favorite videos again, so let's assume he fills 1 drum of grapes (since it takes him 57 days to fill 108 drums).

Therefore, in 58 days, he will fill 1 drum of grapes."
Response:  If they have 36 collectors that fill 8 drums of grapes per day, it means they will fill 216 drums in one day (36 x 8 = 288). To fill 240 drums, they will need 24 days (240 / 288 = 24).
"Response:  If the person had 26 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has the same number of animals as the other aquariums, then we can say that there are x animals in each aquarium. Since there are 52 marine animals in total, we can set up the equation:
x + x +... + x = 52 (where x is the number of animals in each aquarium)
Now, let's solve this equation. We know that there are 26 aquariums, so we can write:
x + x +... + x = 52 / 26 (since there are 26 aquariums)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
x = 2
So, each aquarium has 2 marine animals. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Each acuario has 2 marine animals."
Response:  We know that there were 40 marine animals in different aquariums. If each aquarium has 2 animals, then... (1)...the number of aquariums is equal to 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, there were 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium contains 39 animals. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Total number of saltwater animals = Number of saltwater aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Total number of freshwater animals = Number of freshwater aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of saltwater animals = 56 x 39 = 2274 Total number of freshwater animals = 10 x 39 = 390 So, Tyler has 2274 saltwater animals and 390 freshwater animals.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 22 acuaries for saltwater animals and each acuarium contains 46 animals. So, the total number of saltwater animals is 22 x 46 = 952 animals. Therefore, Tyler has 952 saltwater animals.
Response:  The first part of the question says that there are 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium has 19 animals, so we have 15 x 19 = 285 animals for saltwater animals. Now, let's move to the second part of the question which states that there are 62 aquariums for freshwater animals and each aquarium also has 19 animals, so we have 62 x 19 = 1238 animals for freshwater animals in total. Therefore, the total number of animals is 285 + 1238 = 1523 animals.
Response:  If las camisetas blancas se pueden comprar en paquetes de 13, then Mamá will have... (13 x 39) = 507 camisetas blanca. Therefore, she will have 507 paquetes of white t-shirts.
"Response:  If Mamá buys 66 white shirts and each package contains 3 white shirts, then...

1. How many packages can Mamá buy if she has 66 white shirts to buy?

66 / 3 = 22 packages

So, Mamá can buy 22 packages of white shirts."
Response:  If Mamá buys 28 packages that contain a total of 56 white shirts, then each package must contain how many shirts? To find out, we can divide the number of shirts in all packages (56) by the number of packages (28): Each package contains 2 shirts.
"Response:  Mamá will have...

Step 1: Calculate how many packages of camisetas and pantalones she bought.
Camisetas: 57 / 5 = 11 packages (rounded)
Pantalones: 34 / 3 = 11 packages (rounded)

Step 2: Calculate how many camisetas are in each package.
Camisetas: 11 packages x 53 camisetas per package = 593 camisetas

Step 3: Calculate how many pantalones are in each package.
Pantalones: 11 packages x 34 pantalones per package = 386 pantalones

Step 4: Add up all the camisetas and pantalones to find out how many total items Mamá has.
Total number of camisetas: 593 + 593 = 1186 camisetas
Total number of pantalones: 386 + 386 = 772 pantalones

Therefore, Mamá will have 1186 camisetas and 772 pantalones."
"Response:  If Mamá buys 51 camisetas blancas and each can be bought in packages of 3, then...

Step 1: How many times can 51 be divided by 3?
51 / 3 = 17
So, Mamá will have 17 packages of white shirts."
Response:  We know that the mother buys 70 white shirts in total and she buys them in packages of 14. So, we can say that each package contains 70 / 14 = 5 shirts. Therefore, each package has 5 white shirts.
Response:  If we have 4 bags with the same amount of cookies and a total of 36 cookies, then each bag must contain an equal number of cookies. Therefore, if Bag A contains x cookies, Bag B contains x cookies, Bag C contains x cookies, and Bag D contains x cookies. So, the number of cookies in each bag is x.
"Response:  If I have 33 galleys and each bag has 11 galleys, then...

Step 1: How many bags can I make with 33 galleys?
33 / 11 = 3 bags
So, I have 3 bags of gallety."
"Response:  If each bag has 41 gallettes and you have 53 bags of gallettes, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many gallettes are in one bag.
Galletas per bag = 41

Step 2: Multiply the number of bags you have by the number of gallettes in each bag to find the total number of gallettes you have.
Total number of gallettes = Number of bags x Galletas per bag
Total number of gallettes = 53 x 41
Total number of gallettes = 2,193

Therefore, if you have 53 bags of gallettes, you would have a total of 2,193 gallettes."
Response:  If we have 14 galleys in total and 7 bags with equal number of galleys, then each bag has 14/7 = 2 galleys. So, each bag contains 2 gallets.
"Response:  If each bag has 3 galletas and you have a total of 21 galletas, then...

Step 1: How many bags do you need to fill with 3 galletas each to get 21 galletas in total?
To find out how many bags you need, divide the total number of galletas (21) by the number of galletas in each bag (3):
Number of bags = Total number of galletas / Number of galletas in each bag
= 21 / 3
= 7

So, you need 7 bags to hold all 21 galletas."
"Response:  We know that you have 26 bags with an equal number of cookies. So, if we divide the total number of cookies (52) by the number of bags (26), we get the number of cookies in each bag: 52 / 26 = 2.

Tenía 14 bolsas con la misma cantidad de galletas. Si tenías 28 galletas y 86 caramelos en total, ¿cuántas bolsas de galletas tienes?

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step. If you have 14 bags with the same amount of cookies and each bag has 28 g of cookies, then the total number of cookies in all bags is 14 x 28 = 352 g of cookies.
Since there are also 86 candies, the total weight of both is 352 + 86 = 438 g.
So, you have 438 / 28 = 15 bags of cookies."
Response:  The postman has to deliver 5 pieces of junk mail to each block. If he delivers 25 letters to each house in one block, there are 25 / 5 = 5 houses per block. So, there are 5 houses in each block.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the mailman has to deliver 9 pieces of junk mail to each house, then he will have to deliver a total of 180 pieces of junk mail (20 x 9 = 180). So, the number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman must deliver in each block is 180.
Response:  Since there are 6 houses in one square, and each house receives 24 pieces of correspondence trash from the postman, then the total number of pieces of correspondence that the postman must deliver to all the houses is 6 x 24 = 144 pieces of correspondence. Therefore, the postman must deliver 144 / 6 = 24 pieces of correspondence for each house.
Response:  If there are x houses in each cuadra and the postman delivers 2 pieces of junk mail to each house, then he will deliver a total of 2x pieces of junk mail to each cuadra. So, if we divide the number of pieces of junk mail delivered (2x) by the number of houses per cuadra (x), we get x = 2. Therefore, there are 2 houses in each cuadra.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each cuadra and the postman has to deliver 32 pieces of trash mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of trash mail that the postman needs to deliver is:

20 houses x 32 pieces of trash mail per house = 640 pieces of trash mail
So, each cuadra requires the postman to deliver 640 pieces of trash mail."
Response:  The total number of houses in all 78 cuadras is $78 \times 19 = 1462$. Since each house receives $30$ pieces of junk mail, the total number of pieces of junk mail to be delivered is $1462 \times 30 = 43,860$. Therefore, each house will receive $\boxed{43860}$ pieces of junk mail.
"Response:  If there are 55 cuadras and each cuadra has 8 pieces of mail to deliver, then the total number of pieces of mail to deliver is 55 x 8 = 440. 
If the postman delivers 32 pieces of mail to each house in one square, then the number of houses in one square is 440 / 32 = 13.67 (approximately 14 houses per square). So, there are approximately 14 houses in each square."
Response:  The total number of houses in all 81 cuadras is 12 x 81 = 972 houses. Since each carrier has to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, the total number of pieces of junk mail that need to be delivered is 972 x 4 = 3888 pieces. Therefore, the carrier needs to deliver 3888 pieces of junk mail in each cuadra.
Response:  Since there are 17 houses in each block and the mailman has to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, he will have to deliver a total of 17 x 4 = 68 pieces of junk mail. Therefore, the answer is 68.
Response:  We need to divide the total number of canicas (20) into groups of 4. So we will have 5 groups. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We have to divide the total number of eggs (huevos) into groups of 5. So we need to find out how many groups we can make with all the eggs available.
Total Number of Eggs = 15
Now, let's divide it by 5:
Number of Groups = Total Number of Eggs / 5
= 15 / 5
= 3
Therefore, Rebecca will be able to create 3 groups of 5 huevos each."
Response:  If we divide the collection of eggs into groups of 11, then each group will have 2 eggs. So, if there are x eggs in total, then the number of groups is x / 11 = 90. Since each group has 2 eggs, the total number of eggs is 90 x 2 = 180 eggs. Therefore, Rebecca has 180 eggs.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the eggs equally among 4 groups, each group will have how many eggs? So, if she has 8 eggs in total and wants to divide them into 4 groups of equal size, each group will have 2 eggs. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into 3 groups of equal size, she will have to distribute them in such a way that each group has an equal number of eggs. Since there are 15 eggs in total, and Rebecca has 4 canaries, we can start by dividing the eggs equally among the canaries:

Group 1 (canaries): 4 canaries x 15 eggs = 60 eggs

Now, let's see how many eggs are left over for the remaining two groups:

Remaining eggs: 15 - 60 = 90 eggs

So, Group 2 will have 30 eggs, and Group 3 will have 60 eggs."
"Response:  We need to divide the total number of items into groups of 6. So we will divide 18 (huevos), 72 (plátanos) and 66 (canicas).

For the eggs: 18 / 6 = 3 groups
For the bananas: 72 / 6 = 12 groups
For the corn: 66 / 6 = 11 groups
Therefore, there will be 3 + 12 + 11 = 36 groups."
Response:  We have to divide the total number of items into groups of 3. So we will divide them like this: 99/3 = 33 groups of huevos. Since each group has 3 huevos, then the total number of huevos is 33 x 3 = 105 huevos. Now let's see how many groups of canicas and plátanos we will get: 9 / 3 = 3 groups of canicas. And 27 / 3 = 9 groups of plátanos. Therefore, there will be 3 + 9 = 12 groups in total.
Response:  If we divide the eggs equally among groups of 5, then Rebecca will have 4 groups of 5 eggs each (since she has 20 eggs). Therefore, she will have 20 eggs left over after dividing them into groups of 5. Now, let's count how many canicas Rebecca has: 6 canicas. So, Rebecca has 20 - 6 = 14 eggs more than canicas.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 canaries and 12 eggs. If she divides them into groups of 20, then each group will have 20/5 = 4 canaries and 20/12 = 1.67 eggs per group (since you cannot divide an egg between two groups). So, Rebecca has 5 more eggs than canaries. Therefore, Rebecca has 12 - 5 = 7 eggs left over after dividing the eggs among the groups.
"Response:  If Luke obtained 154 points and gained 11 points in each round, we can write an equation as follows:

Points = Number of Rounds x Gain per Round

Substituting the given values, we get:

154 = x × 11

Now, dividing both sides by 11 gives us:

x = 14 (rounded to nearest integer)

Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds in the game of trivia."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a game of trivia and obtained 46 points in each round, then he scored a total of... (calculate)

Solution: To calculate the total number of points that Luke scored in the game, we need to multiply the number of rounds he played by the number of points he obtained in each round. Therefore, the total number of points Luke scored is:

177 x 46 = 8,322 points

So, Luke scored 8,322 points in the game of trivia."
"Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of a game of trivia and he got the same amount of points in each round, then we can write:

Luke scored 84 points after 2 rounds = (Luke scored x points per round) × 2

Now, we need to find out how many points Luke scored per round. We are given that Luke scored 84 points after 2 rounds, so if we divide the total number of points he scored by the number of rounds he played, we get:

84 points / 2 rounds = x points per round

Solving for x, we get:

x = 42 points per round

Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per round."
Response:  If Luke won 146 points in each round of the game, then he must have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 22,322 points in the entire game. Therefore, the correct answer is 22,322 points.
"Response:  If Luke won 3 points in each round of the game and he obtained 78 points in total, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of rounds played. We know that Luke won 3 points per round, so if he obtained 78 points in total, it means he played $78 / 3 = 26$ rounds."
Response:  If Emily had 2 beads and could make 32 collars, then she must have used each bead to make 4 collars (32 / 2 = 16). So, she needs 16 beads for each collar.
Response:  If Emily made 11 collars and each collar has 28 beads... So, in total, she had to make 11 x 28 = 298 beads!
Response:  If Emily has 16 cuentas and each collar carries 8 cuentas, then she can make 2 (16 / 8 = 2) collars.
Response:  If Emily made 18 collars and had 6 beads, then each collar requires how many beads to complete it. To find this out, we can divide the total number of beads (6) by the number of collars (18). So, each collar needs 3 beads (6 / 18 = 3).
"Response:  If Emily made 4 collars and each collar has 5 beads, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads used to make all 4 collars.
Total number of beads = Number of beads per collar x Number of collars made
= 5 beads/collar x 4 collars
= 20 beads

Therefore, Emily had 20 beads in total."
Response:  Since Emily has 6 cuentas and each collar needs 3 cuentas, she can make 6 x 3 = 18 collars. Therefore, Emily can make 18 collars.
Response:  If Emily had 5 beads and made 20 collars, then each collar requires an average of 4 beads (20 / 5 = 4). So, she needs 4 beads for each collar.
Response:  If Emily made 26 collars and each collar has 2 beads, then she used a total of 52 beads (2 x 26). So, Emily had 52 beads in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 819058 children in total from the county of Lawrence. Now we need to find out how many children went to summer camp and how many stayed at home. The question states that 668278 children stayed at home, so we can write this down as follows:
Number of children who went to summer camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home
= 819058 - 668278
= 150777
Therefore, 150777 more children passed their summer vacations at the camp compared to those who stayed at home."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 202958 children who went to summer camp and 777622 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children who stayed at home:

Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp
= 777622 - 202958
= 574664
Therefore, there were 574664 more children who stayed at home in comparison with those who went to camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total in the county of Lawrence. Then we have to subtract the number of children who go to summer camp from this total. So, if 629424 children go to summer camp, then how many remain at home? To find out, simply divide the total number of children by the number of children who go to summer camp: 898051 - 629424 = 268627. Therefore, 268627 children stay at home during the summer holidays.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in the county and during summer break, 274865 of them stay at home. So, the number of children who go to camp is equal to 313473 - 274865 = 38609.
"Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation and 455682 children go to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of children = Number of children who stay at home + Number of children who go to camp

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of children = 907611 + 455682

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total number of children = 1363293

Therefore, approximately 1363293 children live in the county of Lawrence."
Response:  We know that during summer break, 800059 children from the county of Lawrence go to camp and the rest stay at home. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children who stayed at home = 828521 - 800059 = 427662. Therefore, approximately 427662 children remained at home.
Response:  We know that during summer break, 61619 children from the county of Lawrence stayed at home and the rest went to a camp. The total number of children in the county of Lawrence is 91676. So approximately, 30057 (61619 - 31612) children from the county of Lawrence were at the camp.
"Response:  We know that:
* 34044 children from the county of Lawrence went to summer camp.
* Of the remaining 134867 children, 424944 were from outside the county.
So, in total, 34044 + 424944 = 458388 children attended the summer camp."
"Response:  We know that there are 610769 children in the county of Lawrence who go to summer camp and 590796 children who stay at home during the same period. Therefore, we can write an equation:

Number of children in the county = Number of children who go to summer camp + Number of children who stay at home

Now, let's find out how many children attend the summer camp:

Number of children who go to summer camp = Total number of children - Number of children from outside the county

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of children who go to summer camp = 610769 - 22

Therefore, the approximate number of children in the county of Lawrence is:

Approximate number of children in the county = Number of children who go to summer camp + Number of children who stay at home
= 610769 + 590796
= 1201565

So, approximately 1.2 million children live in the county of Lawrence."
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children in the county of Lawrence who stayed at home during summer break and 893835 children went to a camp. Additionally, 78 children from outside the county attended the camp. So, we can write an equation: Total number of children = Number of children who stayed at home + Number of children who went to camp - Number of children from outside the county. Now, let's solve for the total number of children: Total number of children = 644997 + 893835 - 78 = 1022000. Therefore, there are 1022000 children in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  If Adam has 3 more manzanas than Jackie, then Jackie has x manzanas. Since Adam has 9 manzanas, we can write an equation: Adam = x + 3. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 9 - 3 = 6. So, Jackie has 6 manzanas.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 manzanas and Jackie has 2 manzanas. To find out how many more manzanas Adam has than Jackie, we can subtract the number of manzanas Jackie has from the number of manzanas Adam has: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Adam has 8 more manzanas than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So, we can say that Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples owned by Jackie and Adam is 1. Hence, Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 manzanas and Adam has 8 manzanas. To find out how many more manzanas Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of manzanas Adam has from the number of manzanas Jackie has: 10 - 8 = 2. So, Jackie has 2 more manzanas than Adam.
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together, then they have 6 - 4 = 2 more apples than each other. So, Adam has 3 apples and Jackie has 3 + 2 = 5 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples is 3 + 5 = 8 apples.
"Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 7 manzanas between them, then together they have 7 + 7 = 14 manzanas. So, if Adam has x manzanas more than Jackie, then Jackie has 14 - x manzanas. Since we are asked how many manzanas ""Nombre"" has, we can set up an equation using this information: Nombre = 14 - (x + 7). Now we need to solve for ""Nombre"". Can you do that?"
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 12 manzanas together. So, if they have x more manzanas than just Adam and Jackie together, then Adam has 9x more manzanas than Jackie. Now we can substitute this information into the equation to solve for x: 12 = 9x + 8 (since Adam has 8 more manzanas than Jackie). Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, Adam has 9x = 36 manzanas more than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more manzanas than Jackie, so Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 manzanas. Then we know that together they have 2 manzanas, which means that Adam has 14 - 2 = 12 manzanas. Finally, we are told that Adam has 6 more manzanas than he and Jackie together, so Adam has 12 + 6 = 18 manzanas. Therefore, Adam has 18 manzanas in total.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has x - 5 apples. Since Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, we can write the equation: 89 + 11 = x - 5. Solving for x, we get x = 95. Therefore, Adam has 95 apples.
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday, 270 today, and 419 yesterday afternoon. So, in total, Helen baked 31 + 270 + 419 = 620 cookies until last night. Therefore, the answer is 620.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 90 galleys with sprinkles of chocolate. Today, she baked 51 galleys with raisins and 484 galleys with sprinkles of chocolate. So, in total, Helen baked 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 galleys with sprinkles of chocolate. Therefore, Helen horneó 625 galletas con chispas de chocolate.
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 527 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles and 86 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles yesterday. Then she baked 86 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles and 554 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles today. So, in total, Helen baked 527 + 86 = 613 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles. Therefore, Helen hornoed 613 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles.
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 85 galettes with raisins and 403 galettes with chocolate sprinkles yesterday. So, in total, she baked 85 + 403 = 488 galettes yesterday. Then, today, she baked 397 galettes with chocolate sprinkles and 85 galettes with raisins. Therefore, the total number of galettes that Helen baked for Thanksgiving is 488 + 397 + 85 = 960 galettes. So, Helen horneó 960 galletas con pasas.
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 19 galleys with sparkles of chocolate yesterday and 237 galleys with sparkles of chocolate today. So, in total, Helen baked 256 galleys with sparkles of chocolate (19 + 237). Now, we need to find out how many more galleys with sparkles of chocolate than galleys with raisins Helen baked. To do this, we subtract the number of galleys with raisins from the total number of galleys with sparkles of chocolate: 256 - 23 = 233. Therefore, Helen baked 233 gallety with sparkles of chocolate more than galleys with raisins.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen baked 197 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles yesterday and 75 gingerbread cookies with sprinkles today. So, the difference between the number of gingerbread cookies with sprinkles that Helen baked yesterday and today is:  
Yesterday - 197 = Today 
Therefore, Helen baked 122 more gingerbread cookies with sprinkles today than she did yesterday."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen baked 280 galletas de pasas and 359 galletas con chispas de chocolate yesterday (yesterday means ""ayer"" in Spanish). So, if we compare these numbers with today's baking, we can see that Helen baked more galletas de pasas today than she did yesterday. Specifically, she baked 300 galletas de pasas today, which is more than the 280 galletas de pasas she baked yesterday. Therefore, the difference between the number of galletas de pasas that Helen baked yesterday and today is 300 - 280 = 20 galletas de pasas.   Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, Helen baked 280 galletas de pasas and 359 galletas con chispas de chocolate yesterday. Today, she baked 300 galletas de pasas and 359 galletas con chispas de chocolate. To find out how many galletas de pasas Helen baked today compared to yesterday, we subtract the number of galletas de pasas she baked yesterday from the number she baked today: 300 - 280 = 20 galletas de pasas."
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 81 = x + 59 (where x is the number of games that Katie's friends have). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation: 22 = x. Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  Katie has 91 games of DS and her new friends have 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now let's consider the old friends. They have 53 games in total. Therefore, the total number of games that Katie's friends have is 179 + 53 = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games. Now let's find out how many old games they have. According to the question, Katie has 86 old games and her friends have 86 old games too. So altogether they have 86 + 86 = 172 old games. Therefore, the total number of games that Katie and her friends have is 126 (new) + 172 (old) = 308 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so together she has 103 games (84 + 19). Our friend has 8 new games and 69 old games, so altogether they have 77 games (8 + 69). Therefore, Katie and her friends have a total of 180 games (103 + 77) together.
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So in total, they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 63 = x + 57 (where x is the number of games more Katie has than her friends). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 57 from both sides of the equation: 63 - 57 = x. Simplifying, we get x = 6. Therefore, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now we are told that her friends have 34 new games. So, the number of games that Katie has is greater than the number of games her friends have. Therefore, the answer is 96 - 34 = 62 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Jason had $19 at first and then he earned $33 from washing cars. So, his new amount of money is $33 + $19 = $52. Therefore, Jason gained $52 by washing cars last weekend.
Response:  We know that Fred had $86 last week and he earned $2 from washing cars during the weekend. So now he has $88. Jason had $5 last week and didn't earn anything new, so he still has $5. Therefore, together they have $88 + $5 = $93.
Response:  We know that initially Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. So together they had $35 (Fred + Jason). Then they worked during the weekend and earned money. Now we know that Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So the total amount of money they earned is $109 ($40 + $69). Therefore, Fred gained $74 during the weekend ($109 - $35).
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 last week and now he has $21. So, he lost $93 during the week. And we also know that Jason had $22 last week and now he has $78. So, he gained $56 during the week. Therefore, Jason earned $56 during the week.
Response:  We know that Fred had $111 last week and after he laundered cars, he gained $4 ($115 - $111). Now we need to find out how much money Jason made from delivering newspapers. Last week, Jason had $40 and now he has $44, so he gained $4 ($44 - $40). So, in total, they earned $8 ($4 + $4) by laundering cars.
Response:  We know that Fred had $49 at first and then earned $112 from washing cars. So his new amount is $112 + $49 = $161. Now we learn that Jason had $3 to start with and now has $63 after delivering newspapers. Therefore, the total amount of money they both gained from their activities is $161 (Fred) + $63 (Jason) = $224.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 and after he delivered newspapers, he got $14. So, his new amount is $31 + $14 = $45. Now, let's consider Fred. He had $78 before and after laundry cars, he gained $90 - $78 = $12. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned delivering newspapers is $45 (Jason) + $12 (Fred) = $57.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 + $16 = $49 dollars before he started doing any work during the weekend. Then, he earned $74 from washing cars, so his new total amount of money is $49 + $74 = $123 dollars. Therefore, Fred gained $84 dollars during the weekend ($123 - $49).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 initially and then he earned $111 from delivering newspapers and $34 from washing cars. So, his new total amount of money is:
$47 + $111 + $34 = $282
Therefore, Fred has $282 now."
"Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg before starting to run every day and she lost 20 kg after running, then her current weight is:
Jessie's weight = 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg
Therefore, Jessie now weighs 51 kg."
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 27 kg before starting to run and after running for some time she lost 101 kg. So, if we subtract her initial weight from her final weight, we get: 101 - 27 = 74 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed 74 kg before starting to run.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 192 kg (as stated in the problem). After running every day for some time, she lost 126 kg, which means that her weight now is 66 kg. So, before beginning to run, Jessie weighed 192 kg - 126 = 66 kg.
"Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running every day for some time, she lost 35 kg, which means she now weighs:

69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg

So, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg after losing weight through running."
Response:  If Jessie weighed 114 kg initially and lost 50 kg in the first week, then she weighed 64 kg after one week. In the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so her current weight is 64 + 60 = 124 kg. Therefore, Jessie now weighs 124 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 9 kg initially and lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week. So, after two weeks of running, Jessie's weight is: 9 + (62 - 62) = 9 + (-62) = 3 kg. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 3 kg.
Response:  After one week of running every day, Jessie lost 56 kg in the first week. So after one week, her weight would be: $W_1 = W_0 - 56$ kg. Here, $W_0$ is her initial weight, which was $92$ kg. Therefore, after one week, Jessie weighed: $$W_1 = 92 - 56 = 36$$ kg.
"Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes and 61 alligators in total. If 64 of them are hidden, then we can say that the number of non-hidden snakes is equal to the total number of snakes minus the number of hidden snakes. So, the number of non-hidden snakes is:
95 - 64 = 31
Therefore, there are 31 non-hidden snakes in the zoo."
"Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes in the enclosure and 97 caimans. If 40 of them were hidden, then we can say that the number of visible caimans is equal to the total number of caimans minus the number of hidden ones:

Number of visible caimans = Total number of caimans - Number of hidden caimans
= 97 - 40
= 57

So, there are 57 non-hidden caimans in the enclosure."
Response:  We know that in total there are 3 + 75 = 78 caimanes and 82 - 19 = 63 serpentes. So, if 75 caimanes were hidden, then 3 caimanes (the difference between the total number of caimanes and the number of caimanes hidden) are not hidden. Therefore, 3 caimanes are not hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the zoo enclosure. If 24 of them are serpents and 51 are alligators, then we can say that the number of non-escaped animals is equal to 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 animals not hidden or escaped from the enclosure.
Response:  The farmer had initially 171 tomatoes in his garden. Then he collected 134 of them yesterday and 30 today. So, after collecting both days, he will have 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden initially. Then he collected 56 of them yesterday, so he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left. Today, he collected another 41 tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left.
Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden to start with. Then he collected 154 yesterday and 50 today. So, the total number of tomatoes he collected is: 90 + 154 = 244.
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he collected 172 potatoes, then he has 3 tomatoes left (since we subtracted 172 from 175). So, the farmer now has 175 - 3 = 172 tomatoes and 77 - 172 = -9 papas (since we subtracted more tomatoes than we collected). Therefore, the farmer now has 172 tomatoes and -9 papas.
"Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he collected 53 tomatoes, then the number of tomatoes left is:

177 - 53 = 124

So, the farmer has 124 tomatoes left in his garden. Similarly, if he collected 53 tomatoes, the number of papas (potatoes) left is:

12 - 53 = -41

Since negative numbers are not possible, there must be 93 papas left in the farmer's garden. Therefore, the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 93 papas left in his garden after collecting 53 tomatoes."
"Response:  The farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden initially. If he collected 137 tomatoes, then...
Step-by-step solution:
Let X be the total number of tomatoes that the farmer had before collecting any tomatoes.
X = 105 + 71 = 176
The farmer collected 137 tomatoes. So, the new total number of tomatoes is:
X + 137 = 176 + 137 = 313
Therefore, there are 313 tomatoes left after the farmer collected 137 tomatoes from his garden."
Response:  If each tabla of madera needs 2 clavos to be secured, then John will need 8 clavos (2 x number of tablas) to secure all the tablas for the house wall. So, John will need 8 clavos in total.
Response:  For the big tables, each table needs 17 clavos and for the smaller ones, each one needs 8 clavos. So, if we have x number of big tables, then total number of clavos needed is 17x. Similarly, if we have y number of small tables, then total number of clavos needed is 8y. Now, we are told that John has used 13 big tables and 5 small tables. Therefore, total number of clavos needed by John is 17(13) + 8(5) = 209 clavos.
Response:  We know that for each big wooden table, John needs to use 3 claws to secure it to the wall. Therefore, if he used 8 additional claws, this means he secured 8 tables with those extra claws. So, in total, John needed 8 + 3 = 11 claws to secure all the big wooden tables for the house walls.
Response:  For the big tables, he needs 15 clavos. Since there are 12 big tables, he needs 15 x 12 = 180 clavos for them. For the small tables, he needs 5 clavos per table, since there are 10 small tables, he needs 5 x 10 = 50 clavos for them. So in total, John needs 180 + 50 = 230 clavos to secure the walls of the house.
Response:  We know that each table needs two screws to be secured and since there are 16 tables needed for the wall, we need 32 screws in total. So, John needs 32 screws to secure all the tables for the house wall.
"Response:  If we assume that each wall of the house needs 8 tablas (since there are 8 walls in total), then we need to calculate how many clavos will be needed for all those tablas. Since each tabla requires 74 clavos, we can write an equation as follows: Number of clavos = Total number of tablas x Number of clavos per tabla So, if we substitute the value of 8 for ""Total number of tablas"", and 74 for ""Number of clavos per tabla"", we get: Number of clavos = 8 x 74 = 592 Now, since we want to know how many tablas John needs to secure the entire house, we can divide the total number of clavos by the number of clavos required per tabla: Number of tablas = 592 / 74 = 8 Therefore, John needs 8 tablas to secure the entire house."
Response:  For each big table, he needs 14 claws and for each small table, he needs 25 claws. So, if he uses 12 big tables, he will need 12 x 14 = 168 claws. And if he uses 17 small tables, he will need 17 x 25 = 425 claws. Therefore, John needs a total of 168 + 425 = 593 claws to secure all the tables for the house wall.
Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of chicle in each package and a total of 42 pieces of chocolate. So if we divide the number of pieces of chocolate (42) by the number of pieces per package (3), we get the number of packages: 14 packages. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of chicle.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of gum and each package contains 23 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum is 43 x 23 = 997. Now we are told that Robin has 8 additional pieces of gum, so the final answer is 997 + 8 = 1005 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 7 pieces of gum in each package and he has 6 additional pieces of gum as extras. So, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of gum. Since we are asked how many packages Robin has, we can conclude that Robin must have more than one package since he has 42 pieces of gum in total. Therefore, the answer is greater than 1 package.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and 13 packages of caramels. If each package contains 4 pieces of candy, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has.
Total number of pieces = Number of packages x Number of pieces per package
= 28 x 4
= 112 pieces

Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of chicle."
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. Now, we are asked how many pieces of candy Robin has. Since each package of candy contains 45 pieces, Robin has 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy. Therefore, Robin has a total of 189 + 405 = 594 pieces of both gum and candy.
Response:  If Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 6 pieces, then... (1) x = 28 × 6 = 168 pieces of gum that Robin has. Similarly, if he has 14 packages of caramels and each package contains 6 pieces, then... (2) x = 14 × 6 = 84 pieces of caramels that Robin has. Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of candy.

Answer: Yes, we can use the formula provided to find the number of hours worked by the employees in a year. Let's plug in the values given in the question:Total hours worked = 50 employees x 8 hours/day x 5 days/week = 400 hours/yearSo, the employees work 400 hours in a year."
Response:  If the machine worked for 5 minutes, it means that in those 5 minutes, it could have made 5 x 4 = 20 camisas. So, the answer is 20 camisas.
"Response:  We know that yesterday the machine made 9 camisas and today it made 44 camisas. So, if we divide the number of camisas made today by the time taken to make one camisa (which is 3 minutes), we get...

$$ \frac{44}{3} =? $$

Solving for $x$, we get...

$$ x = 14 $$

So, the machine worked for 14 minutes yesterday."
Response:  The machine made 13 camisas yesterday and 3 today, so in total it has produced 16 camisas (13 + 3). If it can make 8 camisas per minute, then the time taken to produce these 16 camisas is given by: Time = Number of camisas / Rate at which they are produced = 16 / 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes in total.
Response:  The machine made 8 camisas today and it can make 2 per minute. So, in one hour (60 minutes), it will make 60/2 = 30 camisas. Therefore, the machine worked for 30 minutes today.
Response:  If the machine can make 3 camisas per minute and yesterday it made 4 camisas, then in total it worked for (4 + 3) = 7 minutes. And if today it made 8 camisas, then in total it worked for (8 + 3) = 11 minutes. So, the answer is 11 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 12 minutes and made 6 camisas per minute, so it produced 72 camisas (12 x 6). Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes again, but now it can make 8 camisas per minute instead of 6, so it produced 96 camisas (12 x 8) in total. Therefore, the machine produced 72 + 96 = 168 camisas in total.
Response:  The machine can make 6 shirts per minute, so in 5 minutes it made 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes and produced 12 x 6 = 72 shirts. Therefore, the total number of shirts the machine made today is 30 + 72 = 102 shirts.
Response:  If they won $165 in 5 days, that means they won $33 per day. So, the answer is $33.
Response:  The game of ring toss at the carnival made $144 per day. They were there for 22 days. So, how much money did they make in total? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount = Number of days x Daily earnings $144/day x Number of days = $3,072 (rounded) Therefore, the group made $3,072 during their 22-day stay at the carnival.
Response:  We know that in 30 days they won $420 with the game of ring toss and $22 additional. So, if we divide the total amount gained ($420 + $22) by the number of days (30), we get the daily gain for the game of ring toss: $$ \boxed{\$10} }$$
Response:  The game of ring toss in the carnival made $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. So, the total amount of money earned is: $382 + $374 = $756.
Response:  The total amount of money earned in the first 20 days is $120. So, we can calculate how much they earned per day as follows: Total earnings / Number of days = Daily earnings. In this case, the daily earnings would be: $120 / 20 = $6 per day. Therefore, during the first 20 days of the carnival, they earned $6 per day.
Response:  We know that in the first 154 days of the carnival, they raised $325. So, if we divide this amount by the number of days (154), we get the daily revenue: $2.09 per day. Now, let's find out how much they raised during the remaining 57 days of the carnival. If we subtract the amount they raised during the first 154 days from the total amount raised ($325 + $114 = $439), then we can calculate the daily revenue for the remaining days: $439 / 57 = $7.68 per day. Therefore, the carnival raised $7.68 per day during the last 57 days of the event.
Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought 10 packages of cookies and 4 packages of cakes. So, in total, she bought 10 + 4 = 14 packages. Therefore, Lucy bought more packages of cookies than packages of cakes. The answer is 14 - 4 = 10.
Response:  If Lucy bought 4 paquetes of galletas, that means she bought 4 x 10 = 40 packages of cookies. If she bought 22 paquetes of pastries, that means she bought 22 x 5 = 110 packages of pastries. And if she bought 16 paquetes of chocolates, that means she bought 16 x 8 = 128 packages of chocolates. So in total, Lucy bought 40 + 110 + 128 = 378 packages of food. Therefore, the answer is 378.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of cake. So, she had a total of 27 packages of food. Since we already know how many packages of cookies she bought (23), to find out how many packages of cake she bought, we can divide the total number of packages by the number of packages of cookies: 27 / 23 = 1. Therefore, Lucy bought 1 package of cake in total.
Response:  If Lucy bought 2 packages of cookies and 12 packages of candy, then she bought a total of 2 + 12 = 14 packages of sweets. Since at the end she had 56 units of change, that means she spent $56 / 14 = $4 per package of sweets. So, in total, Lucy bought 14 packages of sweets.
Response:  There were initially 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people boarded the bus at the next stop, bringing the total number of passengers to 16 (12 + 4). Since each bus can only carry up to 36 people, we know that there are now too many passengers on the bus. Therefore, the correct answer is 36.
Response:  There were initially 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people boarded and 3 people got off. So, there are now (8 + 12) - 3 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people boarded the bus. So, now there are 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people boarded the train, so now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train.
Response:  If there were 22 parents in the program and a total of 676 people, then the number of children (alumni) would be 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 alumni who attended the program.
Response:  We know that there are 73 parents and 724 students in the program. To find out how many teachers are in the program, we can subtract the number of students from the total number of people mentioned in the question: 744 - 724 = 20. So, there were 20 teachers in the program. Therefore, the answer is 20.
"Response:  If there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students, then we can calculate how many more students than parents are involved in the program as follows:

Number of students - Number of parents = x
x = 521 - 174 = 347
Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents in the program."
"Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students. The capacity of the program is 44 people. So, we need to find out how many times 44 goes into 238 (the total number of people).

$ \text {Number of times 44 goes into 238} = \divide {238}{44} $

$ = 5 $

So, there were 5 times 44 = 220 people present at the program."
Response:  If the depth of the cave is 919 feet and they need to travel 1307 feet, then we can calculate the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave as follows: Distance = Depth + Required Distance = 919 + 1307 = 2226 feet So, the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave is 2226 feet.
Response:  The distance from where they are now to the end of the cave is equal to the depth of the cave minus their current height. So, we can write this equation: Distance = Depth - Height. In this case, the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and their current height is 849 feet, so...Distance = 1218 - 849 = 369 feet. Therefore, they have 369 more feet to go until they reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that the distance from the entrance to where they are now is 659 feet. To find out how far it is to the end of the cave, we need to subtract the current distance from the total depth of the cave (762 - 659 = 103). So, there are 103 more feet to go until reaching the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 fish (Paige had raised them). Then, we are told that the stray cats loved to eat the goldfish in the pond and left 6 of them. So, how many fish did they eat? To find out, let's subtract the number of fish left from the initial number of fish: 8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, 2 goldfish were eaten by the stray cats.
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 golden fish and 12 catfish in the pond initially. If the cats loved to eat them, then we can assume that all of the catfish (12) were eaten. So, now Paige has 7 + 12 = 19 fish left in the pond. Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  We know that Paige had 16 fish and 71 cats. If we assume that all of the cats ate fish (which is unlikely), then we can say that each cat ate 71/7 = 10 fish. So, after the cats ate all the fish, there were no more fish left. Therefore, 16 - 10 = 6 fish remained. Since only two fish are now left, we can conclude that 6 - 2 = 4 fish disappeared. Thus, 4 fish dorados desaparecieron.
Response:  If Paige raised 15 goldfish in the pond and the cats ate 5 of them, then there are 10 fish left (15 - 5 = 10).
Response:  The chef had initially 43 manzanas and after making some pies, he was left with 2 manzanas. So, the number of manzanas used to make the pies is 41 (43 - 2).
Response:  The chef had initially 58 apples and made some tarts using 35 of them. So, how many apples are left? We can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of apples = Initial number of apples - Number of apples used in tarts. Substituting the values we know, we get: Number of apples = 58 - 35. Simplifying, we get: Number of apples = 23. Therefore, there were 23 apples left after the chef made the tarts.
Response:  The chef had 40 manzanas and 54 duraznos in total. If he made some tarts using these fruits, then after making those tarts, he would have fewer fruits left. So, let's say he used x manzanas to make the tarts. Since there are 39 manzanas left after making the tarts, we can write an equation as follows: 40 - x = 39. Now solve for x.
"Response:  Since there are 4 estantes in Adam's room and each estante can hold 11 action figures, then the total number of action figures that can fit in his room is:
4 estantes x 11 action figures per estante = 44 action figures
Therefore, the answer is 44 action figures."
Response:  If Adam can place 10 figures of action in each stance, then he has total 10 x 8 = 80 stances for his room. So, his room has 80 stances.
Response:  Since Adam can place 8 action figures and 10 shelves in each of his four estates, he will have a total of 8 x 4 = 32 action figures and 10 x 4 = 40 shelves. Therefore, there are 32 + 40 = 72 items that can be placed in Adam's estantes.
Response:  If there are 544 macetas in each of the 10 gardens, then the total number of macetas is 544 x 10 = 5440. Since each maceta has 32 flowers, the total number of flowers is 5440 x 32 = 176,800. Therefore, there are 176,800 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 466 macetas and each maceta has 53 flowers. So, we have 466 x 53 = 24,798 flowers in total. Now, let's count the number of pallets. Each maceta has 181 palitos, so we have 24,798 x 181 = 4,409,680 palitos in total. Therefore, there are 24,798 flowers and 4,409,680 palitos in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 141 macetas and each maceta has 71 flowers. So, we have...
Step 1: Calculate the number of flowers in all the macetas.
Number of flowers = Total number of macetas x Number of flowers per maceta
= 141 x 71
= 9,611 flowers
Therefore, there are approximately 9,611 flowers in total."
Response:  If each maceta has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total, then we can say that... See explanation for more details.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 sketches. If we organize them into groups of 154, then each group will contain how many Skittles? To find out, divide the total number of Skittles by 154. So, the size of each group is: 4502 / 154 = 29.38 groups. Therefore, each group contains approximately 29 Skittles.
Response:  If there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 sketches, then we can say that each group will have approximately 4950 / 3941 = 1.26 Skittles per group. So, each group is approximately 1.26 Skittles large.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 groups of Skittles in total because we were given that information at the beginning of the problem. Now let's find out how many Skittles each group contains. To do this, we need to divide the total number of Skittles (896) by the number of groups (8). So, if we divide 896 by 8, we get... 

Group size = Total number of Skittles / Number of groups
= 896 / 8
= 112

So, each group of Skittles contains approximately 112 Skittles."
"Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each grade has 5 students, then...
Step 1: Calculate the number of grades based on the number of students.
Number of grades = Total number of students / Number of students per grade
= 270 / 5
= 54 grades
Therefore, there are 54 grades in total."
Response:  We know that the school has 304 degrees and each degree has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of degrees x Number of students per degree To find out how many students there are in total, we need to multiply the number of degrees (304) by the number of students per degree (75). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is: 304 x 75 = 22,500 students.
