Response:  In Monday (понедељак), Julia played with 18 children.  In Tuesday (уторак), she played with 10 children. So, we can say that Julia played with more children in Monday than in Tuesday. The difference between these two numbers is: 18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.
Response:  In Monday (понедељак), Julia played with 11 children.  In Tuesday (уторак), she played with 12 children. So, we can say that in Tuesday, Julia played with more children than in Monday. Therefore, the answer is: 12 - 11 = 1.
Response:  Julija played tug with 5 children on Monday and then with another group of 10 children on Tuesday. If she played with 15 children in total, then she must have played with 10 children on Tuesday (since 15 - 5 = 10). Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Julija played with 14 children in Tuesday and 16 children in Wednesday, then she played with 30 children in total (14 + 16). So, she played with 30 children in Monday.
Response:  If Julija played with 16 children on Monday and more than 12 children on Tuesday, then we can say that she played with at least 4 more children on Tuesday than on Monday. So, if she played with 16 children on Monday, then she played with at least 20 children on Tuesday (since 16 + 4 = 20).
Response:  If Julija played with 14 children in Tuesday and she played with more than 8 children in Monday than in Tuesday, then we can write an inequality based on the information given:  Number of children Julija played with in Monday > Number of children Julija played with in Tuesday. Now let's solve for the value of x (the number of children Julija played with in Monday): In Monday, Julija played with 8 + x children, since she played with more than 8 children. In Tuesday, Julija played with 14 - x children, since she played with fewer children than in Monday. We are asked to find out how many children Julija played with in Monday. To do this, we need to isolate the variable x. Subtracting the two equations gives us: 8 + x = 14 - x. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 3. Therefore, Julija played with 3 more children in Monday than she did in Tuesday.
Response:  Julija played with 17 children on Monday, 15 children on Tuesday, and 2 children on Wednesday. So, in total, she played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  If Julija played with 15 children in Monday and Tuesday, then she played with 30 children in total (15 + 15). Therefore, she played with 30 children in those two days.
"Response:  If Julija played with 5 children in Monday and 9 children in Tuesday, then she played with 5 + 9 = 14 children in total from Monday to Tuesday.  Since Wednesday is not mentioned in the question, we cannot determine how many children Julija played with on that day. Therefore, the answer for Wednesday is unknown or ""Not given""."
"Response: 
Julija played with 2 children on Monday (2 decade), 14 children on Tuesday (tueday), and 16 children on Wednesday (Wednesday). So, in total, Julija played with 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 children."
Response: 1) Julija played with 9 children on Monday (понедељак). 2) She played with 7 children on Tuesday (уторak). 3) She played with 96 children on Wednesday (среда). So, we can see that she played more with children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is: More than 7 - 9 = 2.
"Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 14 children on Monday (понедељак), 2 children on Tuesday (уторак), and 8 children on Wednesday (среда). So, we can write down the information as follows:

Monday (понедељак): 14 children
Tuesday (уторак): 2 children
Wednesday (среда): 8 children

Now, let's compare the number of children Julia played with on each day:

Monday (понедељак) - 14 children > Tuesday (уторак) - 2 children > Wednesday (среда) - 8 children

Therefore, Julia played with more children on Monday than she did on either Tuesday or Wednesday."
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. So, we have three numbers of children she played with: 8, 11, and 9. We need to find out which number is greater than the other two. To do this, we can compare each number to the others using basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For example, if we want to know whether 8 is greater than 11, we can simply add them together and see that 8 + 3 = 11 (where 3 is the difference between 8 and 11). Similarly, if we want to know whether 9 is greater than 11, we can subtract 9 from 11 and see that 11 - 9 = 2 (where 2 is the difference between 11 and 9). Based on these comparisons, we can determine which number is greater than the others. In this case, let's compare the numbers of children Julia played with on different days:  Monday: 8 children Tuesday: 11 children Wednesday: 9 children From these comparisons, we can see that 11 is greater than both 8 and 9. Therefore, Julia played with more children on Tuesday than on either Monday or Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday (понедељак), Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (вторник), she played with more than 15 children but fewer than 18. Therefore, the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday is between 15 and 18, inclusive. Since there are only three numbers in this range (16, 17, and 18), we can conclude that Julia played with exactly 17 children on Tuesday. Similarly, since Wednesday (среда) has the fewest number of children at 7, Julia played with exactly 7 children on Wednesday as well. So, to summarize:  • Monday: 15 children • Tuesday: 17 children • Wednesday: 7 children
Response:  On Monday (понедељак), Julia played with 13 children. In Tuesday (уторак), she played with 10 children. So far, she has played with 23 children.  On Wednesday (среда), she played cards with 15 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 48 children.
"Response: 
Julija played with 7 children on Monday and 13 children on Tuesday. So, in total she played with 7 + 13 = 20 children."
"Response: 
Julija played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. Therefore, she spent a total of:
Monday: 12 children x 1 hour = 12 hours
Tuesday: 14 children x 1 hour = 14 hours
Total time playing tag: 12 + 14 = 26 hours
So Julija spent a total of 26 hours playing tag with all those children."
Response:  First day (Monday): Julia played with 19 children. Second day (Tuesday): Julia played with 18 children. Total time spent playing both days = 38 hours. So, we can say that Julia played more with children in Monday than in Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  Number of children played with on Monday - Number of children played with on Tuesday = 19 - 18 = 1.
Response:  In Tuesday (уторак), Julia played tag with 5 children.  In Monday (понедељак), she played tag with 6 children. So, we can say that in Monday, Julia played tag with more children than in Tuesday. The difference between 6 and 5 is equal to 1 child. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 18 children in total.  In Monday, she played with 4 children. So, we can say that Julia played with x number of children in Tuesday (since she didn't play with any children on Wednesday). Now, we know that the sum of the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is equal to 18. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 4 = 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. So, Julia played with 14 children in Tuesday.
"Response: 
Julija played with 4 children in Wednesday and 6 children in Monday. So, she played with more children in Monday than in Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julija played with in Monday and Wednesday is:
$$ \text {Number of children played with in Monday - Number of children played with in Wednesday} = 6 - 4 = 2 $$
So, Julija played with $2$ more children in Monday than in Wednesday."
Response:  Bob has eaten parachutes of candy. Then he ate another 25 pieces. So, if he ate altogether 43 pieces of candy, how many pieces did he eat at first? We can solve this problem using division. If Bob ate x pieces of candy initially and then ate y more pieces, we know that the total number of pieces of candy he ate is equal to x + y. In this case, x = 0 because Bob didn't eat any candy initially (he only ate parachutes). Therefore, y = 25, and Bob ate 25 additional pieces of candy. So, the answer is 25.
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate another 42 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. Finally, he also ate 63 more pieces of candy. Therefore, in total, Bobby has eaten 70 + 63 = 133 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobbi has already eaten 33 pieces of candy and then he ate another 4 pieces. So, in total, Bobbi has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Similarly, if he had 14 pieces of chocolate, that means he has eaten 14 + 0 = 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of candies and chocolates that Bobbi has eaten is 37 + 14 = 51.
Response:  Bobbi has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces. So, in total, he has eaten 74 pieces of candy. Then, he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the number of candies and chocolates that Bobbi ate is: 74 - 16 = 58 pieces of candy. So, Bobbi has eaten more candies than chocolates.
Response:  At first, Bob had 20 pieces of candy. Then he ate 34 pieces. So, his remaining amount was 20 - 34 = -14 pieces. But then he ate another 18 pieces, so now he has -14 + 18 = 3 pieces left. Therefore, Bob ate a total of 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially. Then he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Later, he ate another 9 pieces. Therefore, he now has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy remaining.
Response:  Bob had 22 pieces of candy and he ate some. Then he ate another 5 pieces. So, initially he had 22 - 5 = 17 pieces of candy left. Therefore, he ate 3 pieces (5 - 3 = 3) of candy at the beginning.
Response:  Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate two pieces. So, he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Bob had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them. We don't know how many he ate, but let's assume it was x. Then, we know that after eating some of the candy, Bob had 20 pieces left. So, we can write an equation: 32 - x = 20. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 32: x = 20 / 32. Therefore, Bob ate half of the original amount of candy (x = 20/32).
Response:  Bob has eaten 17 pieces of candy initially. Then he ate another 15 pieces. So, in total, Bob has eaten 17 + 15 = 32 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bob still has 36 - 32 = 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Bob has eaten 23 pieces of candy. If he started with 30 pieces of candy, then he must have had 7 pieces of candy left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons and Jack brought 3 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 5 + 3 = 8 balloons at the park. Therefore, Alan has more balloons than Jack at the park.
Response:  Alan brought two balloons to the park and Jack brought three balloons to the park. So, in total, there are five balloons at the park (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, Yake has as many balloons as Alan at the park.
Response:  Alan and Jake brought three balloons to the park together. So, if Alan brought two balloons, then Jake must have brought one balloon. Therefore, the number of balloons brought by Jake is equal to the difference between the total number of balloons (3) and the number of balloons brought by Alan (2). Hence, Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Then, we are told that Alan brought fewer balloons than Jake. So, if Jake brought x balloons, then Alan brought x - 6 balloons. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons brought by Jake and Alan is 6. Hence, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack brought 6 more than Alan, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of balloons brought by Jack = Number of balloons brought by Alan + 6 (Since Jack brought 6 more than Alan) So, if Alan brought 5 balloons, then the number of balloons brought by Jack is: Number of balloons brought by Jack = 5 + 6 = 11 Therefore, Jack brought 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Alan brought 3 balloons to the park and Jack brought 5 balloons to the park. So together they had 3 + 5 = 8 balloons at the park. Then, Alan bought two more balloons in the park, so now he has 8 + 2 = 10 balloons. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Alan and Jack have in the park is 10.
Response:  Alan brought two balloons and Jack brought four balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 2 + 4 = 6 balloons. Then, Alan bought three more balloons in the park. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Alan has is 6 + 3 = 9. So, Alan has nine balloons more than Jack in the park.
Response:  Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and Jack bought 3 more in the park. So, at first, Jack had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons more than Alan. Therefore, Jack has 5 - 2 = 3 more balloons than Alan in the park.
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons and Jack brought 4 balloons to the park. So together they have 9 balloons (5 + 4). Then, Alan bought three more balloons in the park, so now he has 12 balloons (9 + 3). Therefore, the answer is 12.
"Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jack brought 2 balloons. Then, Yake bought three more balloons in the park. So, we have:
Alan = 6 + 3 = 9 balloons
Jack = 2 balloons
In total, there are 9 + 2 = 11 balloons in the park. Therefore, Alan has more balloons than Jack in the park."
Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jack bought 4 more in the park. So, altogether, Alan had 6 + 4 = 10 balloons at the park. Now, compare this with Jake who brought 3 balloons initially. Therefore, Jake has 3 + 4 = 7 balloons more than Alan at the park.
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack bought 3 more in the park. So, altogether, Jack brought 5 + 3 = 8 balloons to the park.
Response:  Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park, so he had 3 + 20 = 23 items in total. Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the park, so he had 5 + 59 = 64 items in total. Therefore, the combined number of balloons that Alan and Jake had in the park is 23 + 64 = 87.
Response:  Alan brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park, so he had 7 + 5 = 12 objects in total. Jack brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park, so he had 6 + 4 = 10 objects in total. Therefore, together they had 12 + 10 = 22 objects in the park.
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons and Jack brought 3 balloons to the park. So together they brought 5 + 3 = 8 balloons to the park. Therefore, Jack brought 8 - 5 = 3 balloons to the park.
Response:  Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and bought 3 more there, so he has a total of 5 balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now, Jack also brought 6 balloons to the park. So, we need to find out how many more balloons Jack has than Alan. We can do this by subtracting the number of balloons that Alan has from the number of balloons that Jack has: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Jack has 1 more balloon than Alan in the park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages. So, if he spends 6 hours/day studying English and 2 hours/day studying Chinese, then the total time spent studying both languages is: 6 + 2 = 8 hours/day Therefore, Ryan spends more hours studying English than Chinese, which means that he spends (8 - 2) = 6 more hours studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, if he spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese, then he spends 7 - 6 = 1 hour more studying Chinese than English. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more per day studying Chinese than English.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and another 3 hours studying Chinese every day. If he spends a total of 4 hours studying both languages each day, then we can write an equation as follows:  English = 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week Chinese = 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week Total time spent studying = English + Chinese = 21 hours/week + 21 hours/week = 42 hours/week Therefore, Ryan spends 42 hours per week studying both English and Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and other subjects. If he spends more time studying English than Chinese, then he must spend at least 7/2 = 3.5 hours per day studying Chinese. Since he spends 2 extra hours per day studying English than Chinese, we can conclude that he spends 3.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours per day studying both languages combined.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and some other languages. If he spends more time studying English than Chinese, then he must spend x + y hours studying English where x is the number of hours he spends studying Chinese and y is the number of hours he spends studying other languages. Since we know that x = 5, we can find y by subtracting the amount of time he spends studying Chinese from the total time he spends studying languages: y = 2 - 5 = -3 hours. So, Ryan spends 2 hours less studying English than he does studying Chinese.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 5 days in total, then:

Total hours spent studying English = 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Total hours spent studying Chinese = 7 x 5 = 35 hours

Therefore, Ryan has spent a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours on both languages combined over the course of 5 days."
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. If he studies for two days, how many total hours will he spend studying each language?

English: 2 days x 6 hours/day = 12 hours
Chinese: 2 days x 5 hours/day = 10 hours
Total hours spent studying both languages: 12 + 10 = 22 hours."
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 5 + 4 = 9 hours per day on language learning. If he studies for 6 days in a row, then he will spend a total of 9 x 6 = 54 hours on language learning during those 6 days.
"Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 10 hours (4 + 6) per day on language learning. Now, let's calculate how many days he spends learning each language:

For English: He spends 10 hours/day x 86 days = 860 hours learning English.

For Chinese: He spends 10 hours/day x 86 days = 860 hours learning Chinese.

So, in total, Ryan spends 860 hours learning English and 860 hours learning Chinese over 86 days."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, so he spends 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week studying English. He also spends 7 hours per day studying Chinese and 3 hours per day studying Spanish, respectively. Therefore, he spends 7 x 24 = 168 hours per week studying Chinese and 3 x 24 = 72 hours per week studying Spanish. In total, Ryan spends 144 + 168 + 72 = 384 hours per week on learning English, Chinese, and Spanish.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which means he spends 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week studying English. He also spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese, which means he spends 3 x 24 = 72 hours per week studying Chinese. Finally, he spends 58 hours per week studying Spanish. So, to calculate how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages: 144 - 72 = 72 hours/week. Therefore, Ryan spends 72 hours more per week studying English than he does studying Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying every day. He spends 2 hours studying English, which means he spends 14 hours (7 - 2) studying other languages (Korean and Spanish). So, he spends more time studying Korean than Spanish. Therefore, the answer is:  More time studying Korean than Spanish.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day. Therefore, he spends 10 hours (2 x 5) studying English per week. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish every day, which means he spends 28 hours (4 x 7) studying Spanish per week. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends studying Chinese: According to the question, he spends 2 hours studying Chinese every day. So, in one week, he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) studying Chinese. Comparing this with the time he spends studying Spanish, we can see that he spends more than twice as much time studying Chinese as he does studying Spanish. Specifically, for every hour he spends studying Spanish, he spends 2 hours studying Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and Chinese every day, then he spends 6 hours studying Chinese in total (since he spends 3 hours studying both languages). So if he spends 2 hours studying English each day, he will spend 4 hours studying Chinese per day ($ $ = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week; therefore, he will spend 4 weeks studying Chinese in total)."
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese each day. Therefore, he spends a total of: 4 x 7 = 28 hours studying English in 7 days. 5 x 7 = 35 hours studying Chinese in 7 days. So, in total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours learning both languages over 7 days.
Response:  On Monday, Tifani had 8 containers of recyclables. If she found 7 more containers on Tuesday, then the total number of containers she had on Tuesday was 8 + 7 = 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  On Monday, Tiphani had 7 containers of canned food for recycling. If she found 12 more containers on Tuesday, then the total number of containers she had on Tuesday was: 7 + 12 = 19. Therefore, the difference between the number of containers Tiphani had on Tuesday and the number she had on Monday is: 19 - 7 = 12.
Response:  If Tiphani had 4 cans of food for recycling on Monday and found some more cans on Tuesday, then we can assume that she has a total of 4 + x cans for recycling where x is the number of additional cans she found. Since there are 12 cans in each bag (as mentioned in the problem), we can write an equation as follows: Number of bags = Total number of cans / Number of cans per bag So, if Tiphani had 4 cans initially and found x more cans, we can set up the following equation: Number of bags = (4 + x) / 12 = x/3 = 2 Now, since Tiphani found 5 additional cans, we have: Number of bags = 2 x/3 = 2 x = 10 Therefore, Tiphani found 10 additional cans.
Response:  If Tiphani collected some cans for recycling and had 5 cans in Monday, then she must have found additional 4 cans on Tuesday. So, the total number of cans Tiphani has is : 5 + 4 = 9 cans. Therefore, there are 9 torbices of cans.
Response:  On Monday (the first day), Tiphani had 10 containers for recycling. Then, she found 3 more containers on Tuesday and 7 more containers on Wednesday. So, in total, Tiphani collected 10 + 3 = 13 containers on Monday, and then she collected 13 + 7 = 20 containers on Wednesday. Therefore, the final number of containers that Tiphani collected is 20.
Response:  On Monday (понедељак), Tiphani collected 8 containers for recycling. Then, she found 10 more containers on Tuesday (утораку). Finally, she found 4 more containers on Wednesday (субота). Therefore, in total, Tiphani found 22 containers after Monday.
Response:  Firstly, Tifani had 3 waste cans for recycling. Next day she found additional 7 waste cans and 44 plastic bottles. So, total number of waste cans = 3 + 7 = 10. Now we need to find out how many plastic bottles were there in those 10 waste cans. Since each waste can contains 44 plastic bottles, so total number of plastic bottles = 10 x 44 = 440. Therefore, the final answer is 440 plastic bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red and 16 green pebbles in the basket. To find out how many more red than green pebbles there are, we can use the following equation: Number of red pebbles - Number of green pebbles = More red pebbles than green pebbles. In this case, the number of red pebbles is 17, and the number of green pebbles is 16, so we can plug these values into the equation to get: 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there are one more red pebble than green pebbles in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red pebbles and 11 green pebbles in the bag. So, we can write this as an equation: 5R + 11G = X, where R represents the number of red pebbles and G represents the number of green pebbles. Now, we want to find out how many more green pebbles than red pebbles are in the bag. To do this, we subtract the number of red pebbles from the total number of pebbles: X - 5 = Y, where Y represents the number of green pebbles minus the number of red pebbles. Solving for Y gives us: Y = X - 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more green pebbles than red pebbles in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red spots and some green spots in the basket. If we assume that all the green spots are equally distributed among themselves, then the number of green spots is equal to the total number of spots minus the number of red spots. Therefore, if there are 10 red spots, the number of green spots must be 15 - 10 = 5. So, there are 5 green spots in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are three red chicks and some green ones in the basket. If there are more than 10 green chickens than red ones in the basket, then we can say that the number of green chicken is greater than or equal to 10. So, the answer is (greater than or equal to 10).
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red sparrows in the basket, and each sparrow has 3 friends (since they travel in groups of 3). So, we have:

7 red sparrows x 3 friends per sparrow = 21 sparrows in total

Now, let's count how many yellow and green sparrows there are:

There are 15 yellow sparrows.
There are 8 green sparrows.

So, the total number of sparrows in the basket is:

21 + 15 + 8 = 44 sparrows

Therefore, there are 44 sparrows in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 8 green prawns in the basket.  Therefore, we can say that the number of green prawns is 8.  Now, let's count the total number of red and yellow prawns together:  Red = 7 + Yellow = 71 = Total = 78. So, the difference between the number of green prawns (8) and the total number of prawns (78) is: Difference = 8 - 78 = -70. Therefore, there are 70 fewer green prawns than red and yellow prawns in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 2 red seeds in the bag and 6 yellow seeds. Therefore, we can write this as follows:  Red = 2 Yellow = 6 Total = 8 Now let's find out how many green seeds there are in the bag. According to the question, there are 14 green seeds in the bag. So we can write this as follows: Green = 14 Total = 8 + 14 = 22 Therefore, there are more green seeds than yellow seeds in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red sparrows in the nest, and we want to find out how many more red than yellow there are. So let's count the number of yellow sparrows first: There are 11 yellow sparrows in the nest. Now, let's subtract the number of yellow sparrows from the total number of sparrows to get the number of red sparrows: Therefore, there are 19 - 11 = 8 more red sparrows than yellow ones in the nest.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red pricks in total and each red prick has 90 yellow dots. So, we have: 6 red pricks x 90 yellows = 540 Total number of dots Now, let's find out how many green pricks are in the basket. According to the question, there are 16 green pricks for every 3 red pricks. Therefore, if there are 540 total dots, then there must be: 540 / 3 = 180 green pricks Since there is one green prick per basket, we can conclude that there are 180 green pricks in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red sparrows in total and 14 yellow ones. So, we have:

Red sparrows = 18
Yellow sparrows = 14

Now, let's find out how many of each color are in the basket:

Red sparrows in basket = Total number of sparrows - Number of yellow sparrows
= 18 - 14
= 4

So, there are 4 red sparrows in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red chickens in the basket, so their total number is 5.  Then we have 14 yellow chickens and 6 green chickens, which means they also add up to a certain number. So, the total number of chickens in the basket is 5 + 14 + 6 = 25. Therefore, the number of green and yellow chickens together is 14 + 6 = 20.
Response:  We have 65 coracles of prawns. Each coracle has 7 red and 3 green prawns. So, in total we have: 7 x 65 = 455 red prawns 3 x 65 = 195 green prawns Therefore, there are 455 red prawns and 195 green prawns in all the coracles together.
Response:  We have 11 coracles of prawns. Each coracle has 10 red and 18 green prawns. So, in total we have:  Red prawns = 10 x 11 = 110 Green prawns = 18 x 11 = 208 Prawns in total = 110 + 208 = 318 Therefore, there are 318 prawns in the basket.
"Response:  We have 6 coracles of pickles. Each coracle has 16 red and 18 green pickles. So, in total we have:

Red pickles: 16 x 6 = 96
Green pickles: 18 x 6 = 108
Total number of pickles: 96 + 108 = 204
Therefore, there are 204 crveni praski (red pickles) in the total amount of pickles."
Response:  We have 7 coracles of prawns and each coracle has 10 red and 2 green prawns. So, in total we have:  Red prawns = 7 x 10 = 70 Green prawns = 7 x 2 = 14 Therefore, there are 14 green prawns in the basket.
Response:  We know that each container has 4 red and 3 green snails. So, in total, we have: 4 x 7 = 28 red snails and 3 x 7 = 21 green snails. Therefore, there are 28 + 21 = 49 snails in all containers combined.
Response:  There are 2 boxes with prawns. Each box has 4 red prawns and some green prawns. In total, there are 12 prawns in all the boxes. So, each box contains:  Red prawns: 4 Green prawns: x Total number of prawns in each box: 4 + x Now, we need to find out how many prawns are in each box. We can do this by using the information given in the question that each box has 4 red prawns and some green prawns. Therefore, the number of green prawns in each box is equal to the number of red prawns minus 4. So, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + x = 4 - 4 ( since there are 2 boxes) Solving for x, we get: x = 8  Therefore, there are 8 green prawns in each box.
Response:  We know that there are 16 prawns in total and 13 of them are red. So, the number of green prawns is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green prawns in the basket.
"Response:  We are given that each corpuscle has 19 red and 4 green prickles. Therefore, we have:

Number of red prickles = 19 x (number of corpuscles)
= 19 x (15)
= 285

Number of green prickles = 4 x (number of corpuscles)
= 4 x (15)
= 60

So, there are in total:

285 red prickles + 60 green prickles = 345 prickles
in all the corpuscles."
Response:  We have 10 portions of prawns divided equally among jars. Each jar has either 4 red or 6 green prawns. So, in total, we have: Number of red prawns = 4 x (10/2) = 20 red prawns Number of green prawns = 6 x (10/2) = 40 green prawns Therefore, there are 20 + 40 = 60 prawns in total.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green marbles in total and 2 red marbles. So, we can write this as an equation: 6G + 2R = Total number of marbles Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: G = 6 (green) R = 2 (red) Substituting these values into our equation gives us: 6(60) + 2(8) = Total number of marbles Simplifying the equation gives us: 360 + 16 = Total number of marbles Therefore, there are more than twice as many green marbles as red marbles in the basket.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf initially. He later added some more action figures to the shelf. If he has a total of 8 action figures on the shelf now, that means he must have added 4 more action figures to the original 4. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  Jerry initially had some action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. If he now has a total of 10 action figures on his shelf, then we can say that he initially had x action figures on his shelf. Since he added 7 new action figures later, we know that x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on his shelf before adding any more.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books in his room initially. Later, he added another 6 action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf is:  Initially, there were 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his room initially. So, the total number of items he had was 5 + 9 = 14.  Later, he added 7 more action figures to his collection, so now he has 14 + 7 = 21 items in total. Therefore, there are 21 - 9 = 12 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures in his room initially. So, the total number of items he had was 10 + 2 = 12.  Later, he added 4 more action figures to his collection, so now he has 12 + 4 = 16 items in total. Therefore, there are 16 - 2 = 14 kinyas (books) on his shelf than action figures.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 10 books to the shelf. So, in total, there are: 8 + 9 = 17 items on the shelf initially. Then, he added 10 more books, so the final number of books on the shelf is: 17 + 10 = 27 books. Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of books now is: 2 + 4 = 6 books. Now, let's count the number of action figures again: 7. Therefore, there are 7 action figures and 6 books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. So, there were 7 items in total (5 action figures + 2 books).  Later, he added 9 more books to his shelf. Therefore, the total number of items on Jerry's shelf now is: 7 + 9 = 16.  So, there are 16 items on Jerry's shelf - action figures and books combined.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, the total number of action figures on his shelf is:  Initially: 8 + (Added later): 4 - (Removed): 5 = 17 Therefore, there were 17 action figures on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  Jerry had three action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added four more action figures and removed some of the old ones from the shelf. If he now has six action figures on his shelf, that means he must have removed two of the original three action figures from the shelf. So, the correct answer is -2.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added some more action figures and removed 10 old ones. So, if he has 8 action figures on his shelf now, that means he added 1 (one) new action figure. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  Jerry initially had some action figures on his shelf. Later, he added more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 old ones. So, if we want to find out how many action figures Jerry originally had on his shelf, we can use the information given in the question as follows:  Number of new action figures added = 2 Number of old action figures removed = 7 Total number of action figures on the shelf now = New action figures + Old action figures = 2 + 7 = 9 Therefore, Jerry originally had 9 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. If we assume that each bookshelf can hold an equal number of books and action figures, then the total number of items on the shelf is now: 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 items (action figures and books) on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  Jerry had three books and four action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were: Books = 3 + 2 = 5 Action figures = 4 + 2 = 6 Therefore, there were six action figures on Jerry's shelf than the number of books he had.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf initially. So, the total number of items he had was 7 + 3 = 10.  Later, he added 2 more action figures to his collection, so now he has 10 + 2 = 12 items in total. Therefore, there are 12 kinyas (books) more than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  We know that initially there were two pigeons sitting on the fence (2). Then more birds came and sat on the fence (x). Since we are told that the total number of birds is 6, then x = 4 (since 6 - 2 = 4). Therefore, 4 additional birds came to sit on the fence.
Response:  At first, there were 3 pigeons on the fence. Then, 2 more pigeons joined them. So, in total, there are now 3 + 2 = 5 pigeons on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We have 4 birds and 46 fish already sitting on the fence. If we add another 6 birds to that number, then the total number of birds will be 4 + 6 = 10. So, there are 10 birds in total sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 2 bubbles already sitting on the fence. If 5 more birds come to join them, then we will have: Birds = 3 + 5 = 8 Bubbles = 2 + 0 = 2 So, there are 8 birds and 2 bubbles on the fence in total.
Response:  We have three birds and four butterflies sitting on the fence initially. Then two more birds join them, making it five birds in total. So far, we have 3 + 5 = 8 creatures sitting on the fence. Now, let's consider the number of sharks (or any other sea creature). There is no mention of sharks or any other sea creature in the question, so there are zero sharks sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final answer is 8 - 0 = 8 pigeons and butterflies sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 2 birds and 6 eagles already sitting on the fence. If 3 more birds come to join them, then there will be 5 birds in total (2 + 3 = 5). Now, if 3 more eagles come to join the existing 6 eagles, then there will be 9 eagles in total (6 + 3 = 9). So, the number of eagles is greater than the number of birds. Therefore, there are 9 eagles and 5 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds and six butterflies sitting on the fence initially. Then two more butterflies join them. So, in total we have... (4 + 2) = 6 shoreta on the fence!
Response:  We have three birds and four butterflies initially sitting on the fence. If six more butterflies join them, then we will have: Birds - 3 + Butterflies - 4 = 7 Total number of insects on the fence. Therefore, there are seven pigeons and seven butterflies on the fence in total.
Response:  We know that there are initially 6 birds and 3 bubbles sitting on the fence. Then, two more bubbles join them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 6 + 2 = 8 Bubbles = 3 + 2 = 5 Now, let's count how many penguins are sitting on the fence: Penguins = 0 (since it is not mentioned anywhere) Therefore, the final answer is: Total number of creatures sitting on the fence = 8 birds + 5 bubbles = 13
"Response:  We have four birds and three hedgehogs sitting on the fence initially. If six more hedgehogs join them, then we have: Birds = 4 Hedgehogs = 3 + 6 = 9 So there are nine creatures in total sitting on the fence. Now, let's count how many sharks are present: Sharks =? According to the question, ""Che four pigeons and three hedgehogs sit on the fence."" Therefore, there are four pigeons and three hedgehogs sitting on the fence initially. Since six more hedgehogs joined them, there are now nine creatures in total sitting on the fence. However, none of these creatures are sharks, so the answer is zero (0)."
Response:  We know that there were initially six birds sitting on the fence. Then, four more birds joined them, and eight bubbles also came to join them. So, in total, we have: 6 + 4 = 10 birds on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 10 pigeons are seated on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, five more birds join them, making it seven in total. Next, four bubbles (which are not ptiices) also come and sit with them, bringing the total number of objects to eleven. So, there are eleven objects (seven birds + four bubbles) sitting on the fence. As for the eagles, we don't know how many there were originally or if any joined later, so let's assume they are zero. Therefore, the final answer is: Eleven - Zero = Ten.
Response:  We have three birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, two more birds and six bubbles join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's consider the number of eagles. According to the question, there are no eagles sitting on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 - 0 = 5 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 5 bubbles and 3 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 4 more birds join them, making it 9 pets in total (5 bubbles + 3 birds + 4 new birds). Now, we know that no aikula is sitting on the fence because the question specifically states that there are no aikulas among the animals present. Therefore, the number of birds sitting on the fence is equal to the number of aikulas, which is zero. So, the answer is simply 0.
Response:  We have 6 bubbles and 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds come to join them. So, in total we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's count how many alligators are there. According to the question, there is only one alligator. Therefore, the ratio of birds to alligators is 9 : 1 or 9 : 10 (since there are 10 alligators).
Response:  We have three birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, six bumblebees and two more birds join them. So, in total, we have: 3 + 6 = 9 creatures sitting on the fence. Now, let's count how many eagles are there: 2 (initially) + 2 (newly joined) = 4 eagles. Therefore, there are 4 eagles more than the number of bees sitting on the fence.
"Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 2 x  = 20 pages.  Now, let's find out how many pages are in each po...

Question: књига има 2 поглавља. Прво погlavlje je dugo 48 страница. Drugo poгlavlje je 11 страница. Колико више страница has the first chapter compared to the second chapter?

Answer: Based on the question, we can conclude that the first chapter has more pages than the second chapter. Specifically, the first chapter has 48 pages, while the second chapter has 11 pages, so the difference between the two chapters is 37 pages (48 - 11)."
"Response:  First po...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.

First poem has 37 pages, and second poem has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second poem than in the first poem, we can subtract the number of pages in the first poem from the number of pages in the second poem:

80 - 37 = 43

So, the second poem has 43 more pages than the first poem."
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 60 pages and the total number of pages in the book is 93. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in the second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the first chapter Number of pages in the second chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two chapters in the book and the second chapter has 36 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter plus the number of pages in the first chapter. So, if the first chapter has x pages, then the total number of pages in the book is given by the equation: x + (36) = 67. Solving for x, we get: x = 31. Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter is 66 pages long, and the second chapter is 35 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages in the two chapters is: 66 + 35 = 101 pages. Now, we are told that there are three chapters in total, so the total number of pages in the book is: 101 + (number of pages in third chapter) = x pages. Since the third chapter has 24 pages, we can substitute this value into our equation to solve for x: x = 101 + 24 = 125 pages. So, the book has 125 pages in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 300 (3 x 100). Now, let's calculate the length of each part:  Part 1 = 91 + 91 +... + 91 = 3 × 91 = 273 pages  Part 2 = 23 + 23 +... + 23 = 3 × 23 = 69 pages  Part 3 = 25 + 25 +... + 25 = 3 × 25 = 75 pages Therefore, the difference between the length of Part 1 and Part 2 is:  Difference = Part 1 - Part 2 = 273 - 69 = 184 pages So, the first part has 184 more pages than the second part.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 35 = 105 pages. Secondly, we know that the second chapter has 18 pages less than the first chapter, so it has 105 - 18 = 87 pages. Finally, we know that the third chapter has only 3 pages, so it has 87 - 3 = 84 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 87 pages and the third chapter has 84 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the book has three chapters and each chapter has different number of pages as follows:  Chapter 1 - 53 pages, Chapter 2 - 75 pages, and Chapter 3 - 21 pages. So, to find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the third chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:  Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 53 pages Number of pages in Chapter 3 = 21 pages Subtracting the number of pages in Chapter 3 from the number of pages in Chapter 1 gives us:  Number of more pages in Chapter 1 than in Chapter 3 = 53 - 21 = 32 pages Therefore, there are 32 more pages in the first chapter than in the third chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 chapters in the book. Each chapter has 61 pages, so the total number of pages is: 31 x 61 = 1831 pages. Therefore, the book has 1831 pages in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book with a total of 46 pages (2 x 23 = 46). Since the first chapter is 10 pages long, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: $ Number of pages in the first chapter = 10 $ Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find out how many pages are in each chapter: $ Total number of pages = 46 $ Number of chapters = 2 $ Number of pages per chapter = $ 46 / 2 = 23 $ So, each chapter has 23 pages.
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book with a total of 169 pages (2 x 81 = 169).  Secondly, we know that the second chapter is longer than the first one and has 68 pages (second chapter length = 68 pages). Therefore, if we divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters, we get: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 169 / 2 = 84.5 pages per chapter. So, the second chapter has approximately 84.5 pages.
Response:  We know that in the morning, 62 campers went for rowing and in the afternoon, 39 campers went for rowing. So, we have to find out how many more campers went for rowing in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of campers who went for rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went for rowing in the morning: 62 - 39 = 23 Therefore, 23 more campers went for rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that in the morning, 52 campers went for rowing and in the afternoon, 61 campers went for rowing. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of campers who went for rowing in the afternoon = Total number of campers - Number of campers who went for rowing in the morning Number of campers who went for rowing in the morning = 52 Now let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Number of campers who went for rowing in the afternoon = 61 - 52 = 9 Number of campers who went for rowing in the morning = 52 Therefore, there were 9 more campers who went for rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 15 campers went fishing in the morning and several more campers went fishing in the afternoon. If there were a total of 32 campers who went fishing that day, then we can say that the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon is equal to the difference between the total number of campers and the number of campers who went fishing in the morning. So, if X is the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon, we can write an equation as follows: X = Total - Morning Where Total is the total number of campers (32) and Morning is the number of campers who went fishing in the morning (15). Solving for X, we get: X = 32 - 15 = 17 Therefore, 17 campers went fishing in the afternoon.
Response:  If 7 campers went fishing in the afternoon and there were initially 60 campers who went for a swim that morning, then we can assume that half of the total number of campers (30) went for a swim in the morning. Therefore, if 7 campers went fishing in the afternoon, then the remaining 23 campers did not go out at all or went somewhere else. So, the correct answer is: 23 campers went for a swim in the morning.
Response:  At 7 am, 13 people went for rowing, at noon - 49 people, and at sunset - 36 people. So in total, we have:  Number of people who went for rowing = 36 + 49 + 13 = 98 people. Therefore, the number of campers who went for rowing is 98.
Response:  In the morning, 44 campers went fishing and in the afternoon, 39 campers came back. So, the total number of campers who went fishing is 44 + 39 = 83. Now, we need to find out how many more campers went fishing in the evening than in the morning. To do this, we subtract the number of campers who came back in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went fishing in the morning: 83 - 39 = 44. Therefore, 44 more campers went fishing in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  If 53 campers threw themselves into the ravine in the morning and only 48 did so in the evening, then there are 53 - 48 = 6 more campers who went into the ravine during the day than in the evening. Therefore, the number of campers that went into the ravine during the day is 6.
Response: 33 campers went out in the morning, and 34 campers went out in the afternoon. So, there are more campers who went out in the afternoon than in the morning. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of campers who went out in the morning from the number of campers who went out in the afternoon: 34 - 33 = 1. Therefore, one more camper went out in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went fishing in the morning and 59 campers went hiking in the morning. In addition, 21 campers went sailing after noon. So, we have:  Morning (13 + 59) = 72 campers who did not go sailing After noon (21) = 21 campers who went sailing Total number of campers who went sailing = 21 Therefore, the total number of campers who went sailing is 21.
Response:  We know that 29 campers went for kayaking in the morning and 66 campers went for hiking. This means that 35 campers (29 + 66) did not go for either activity in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of campers who went for kayaking or hiking after lunch is equal to 35 - 26 = 8 campers. So, 8 campers went for kayaking or hiking after lunch.
Response:  We know that in the morning, 4 campera went for kayaking and 4 campers went for hiking. In total, there were 8 campera who left in the morning.  After lunch, 26 campers went for kayaking. So, in total, there were 34 campers (8 + 26) who went for kayaking or hiking. Therefore, the number of campers who went for kayaking is 34 - 4 = 30, and the number of campers who went for hiking is 34 - 26 = 7.
Response:  We know that in total, 46 campers went for a swim during the day. Of those, 43 campers went fishing in the morning and some other campers went sailing in the afternoon. So, we can say that x number of campers went sailing in the afternoon (where x is the difference between 43 and the total number of campers). Therefore, the number of campers who went sailing in the afternoon is 46 - 43 = 3.
Response:  If Rejchele took 4 jabokes from her tree and initially the tree had 7 jabokes, then there were 3 jabokes left on the tree after she took some. So, there are 3 jabokes still on the tree.
Response:  Rajchel initially had 4 apples on the tree. She picked some of them and now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, she must have taken at least 2 apples. But we don't know how many apples she took exactly. Therefore, our answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Rejche has collected 7 ripe apples from her tree and now there are 5 more unripe apples on the tree. So, in total, there are 12 apples (7 + 5) on the tree. Since three of them are ripe, we can assume that the remaining 9 apples are unripe. Therefore, the number of unripe apples on the tree is 9.
Response:  We know that Rejche has taken 2 jabokes from her tree and now there are 7 jabokes left on the tree. If 6 of them have ripened, then the number of unripe jabokes is equal to the number of ripe ones minus 6 = 7 - 6 = 1. So, there is one unripe jaboke left on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rejche has collected 6 mature apples from her tree and now there are only 2 mature apples left on the tree. So, initially, there were 6 + 2 = 8 apples on the tree. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Rejcheal took three apples from her tree and now there are two apple left on the tree. So, initially, the tree had 3 + 2 = 5 apples. Then, she took one of those apples, leaving 4 apples on the tree. Now, we have 4 x 2 = 8 apples in total (on the tree). Finally, she picked another apple, so now there are 7 apples left on the tree. Therefore, the original number of apples on the tree was 8.
Response:  We know that Rejcheal took 7 apples from her tree initially. After that, two new apples grew on the tree. So, now there are 6 + 2 = 8 apples on the tree in total. Therefore, the initial number of apples on the tree was 7.
Response:  Rajčev drvo had 2 jabukas (apples). She took 4 jabukas from her tree. After that, three new jabukas grew on the tree. So, now there are...  Let's count them: 2 + 3 = 5 jabukas on the tree!
Response:  We know that Rejcheal took 2 jabokes from one of her trees. So, she had 52 - 2 = 50 jabokes left. Now, we are told that she has taken 2 jabokes from another tree, leaving it with 7 jabokes. Therefore, the total number of jabokes Rejcheal had in the beginning was 50 + 7 = 57 jabokes.

Question: Рејчел има три јабука. Она је сабрала 8 јабука са сваког дрвета. сада дрвеће има укупно 9 јабука још увек на њима. Колико је јабука било на свим дрвећем у почетку?

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that Rejche has collected 8 jabok from each tree, so she has collected in total 24 jabok.
Now, we are told that there were still 9 jabok on the trees, which means that the initial number of jabok on the trees was 9 + 24 = 33 jabok.
Therefore, the answer is 33."
Response:  We know that Rejche has collected 7 jabuks from each of the four trees, so she has collected in total 7 x 4 = 28 jabuks. However, there are still 29 jabuks left on the trees, which means that Rejche has not collected all of them. Therefore, the final answer is 28 + 29 = 57 jabuks.
Response:  We know that Ed has 2 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles initially and Doug had y marbles initially, then after the game, Ed will have x + 2 = 19 marbles and Doug will have y - 3 = 16 marbles.  Now we can solve for y (the number of marbles Doug lost): y = 16 - 3 = 13. Therefore, Doug lost 13 marbles during the game.
"Response:  We know that Ed had more than 10 marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had 10 marbles, then we can write an equation:

Ed = x + 10

We also know that Doug lost 11 marbles on the playground. So, after losing those marbles, he had:

Doug = x - 11

Now, we are asked to find out how many marbles Ed had more than Doug. To do this, we need to solve for x in both equations simultaneously:

x + 10 = ed
x - 11 = doug

Solving these two equations, we get:

2x = 31
x = 15

So, Ed had 15 more marbles than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 6 balls than Doug. So, if Ed had x balls, then Doug had x - 6 balls. Since Doug lost 7 of his balls on the playground, he now has x - 7 balls. Now we are told that Ed had 22 balls in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x = 22 - 7. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. So, Ed had 15 balls and Doug had 8 balls (x - 7).
"Response:  We know that Ed had more than 5 marbles than Doug at first. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had 5 marbles, then we can write an equation:

Ed = x + 5

We also know that Doug lost three of his marbles on the playground. So, after losing those marbles, he had:

Doug = x - 3

Now, we want to find out how many marbles Doug had initially. Using both equations, we can solve for x:

x = (Ed) / (Ed = x + 5) = (x - 3) / (x = x + 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 27 / 8 = 3

So, Doug had 3 marbles initially."
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug (Еd је имао више од Дага).  We also know that Ed found 9 additional cups (Ед је пронашао још 9 куглица). So, if we subtract the number of cups that Doug lost from the total number of cups that Ed found, we get:  Number of cups Ed had = Total number of cups Ed found - Number of cups Doug lost  In this case, the total number of cups Ed found is 24 + 9 = 33. Therefore, the number of cups Ed had is:  Number of cups Ed had = 33 - Number of cups Doug lost  Since Doug lost 27 cups, the number of cups Ed had is:  Number of cups Ed had = 33 - 27 = 6. So, Ed had 6 more cups than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had x - 17 marbles, we can write an equation:

Ed = x + 29
Doug = x - 17

Now, we need to solve for x, which is the number of marbles that Ed had initially. To do this, we can subtract Ed's new amount (x + 29) from his initial amount (Eddie):

x = Eddie - (x + 29)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = Eddie - 38

So, Ed had 38 more marbles than Doug initially."
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug before he lost some of them at the playground. So, if Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, and now he has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing some, then we can conclude that Ed initially had 27 (19 + 8) more marbles than Doug.  Therefore, Ed lost 36 - 27 = 9 marbles at the playground.
Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug at first (Ed had 30 more). Then, Ed lost 21 of his marbles on the playground. So, he has fewer marbles now. But we don't know exactly how many fewer because we only know the number of marbles Ed lost, not the total number of marbles he had before or after losing them. However, since Ed started with 91 marbles and lost 21 of them, he must have had at least 70 marbles left after losing those marbles (since 91 - 21 = 70). Therefore, Doug must have had fewer mercury balls than Ed, but we can't say exactly how few without knowing the exact numbers involved in each case.
Response:  Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles, then Doug had x - 12 marbles.  Since Ed lost 20 of his marbles, he now has x - 20.  Therefore, Doug now has x - 12 + 20 = 9 marbles.
Response:  If 408 students have suggested adding pizza to the menu and 42 students have suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who have suggested pizza than those who have suggested bacon. So, we can say that P > B (pizza is preferred over bacon). Now, let's find out how many times more students have suggested pizza than bacon. We know that P = 408 - 42 = 366. Therefore, there are 366/42 = 8.75 times more students who have suggested pizza than bacon.
Response:  If 479 students have suggested adding pizza to their menu and 489 students have suggested adding beef to their menu, then we can say that the number of students who have suggested adding beef is greater than the number of students who have suggested adding pizza. Therefore, the answer is 489 - 479 = 10. So, 10 more students have suggested adding beef than pizza.
Response:  According to the question, out of 310 students, 185 students have suggested adding purée from compote to their meals, while the remaining 125 students have suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who have suggested adding bacon is 125.
Response:  According to the question, out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding beef to their menu, while the remaining 24 students suggested adding purée made from potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding purée is 24.
Response:  If 457 students have suggested adding purée to their menu and 290 students have suggested adding beef, then there are 457 + 290 = 747 students in total who have made suggestions.  Since 63 students have suggested adding purée from those who suggested beef, we can say that 63/747 = 0.084 or approximately 8.4% of the students who suggested beef also suggested adding purée.
Response:  If 182 students have suggested adding purée of cauliflower and others have suggested adding beef, then there are 182 + x students who have suggested adding beef where x is the number of students who did not suggest adding purée of cauliflower. Since 166 students have suggested adding beef, we can write an equation as follows: 182 = 166 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 16. Therefore, 16 students did not suggest adding purée of cauliflower.
"Response:  According to the question, out of 324 students who suggested adding purée, 374 students suggested adding beef in men, and 128 students suggested adding parmesan. Therefore, we can write:

Number of students = 324 + 374 + 128 = 826

So, there were 826 students who participated in suggesting new types of food."
Response:  According to the question, if 257 students have suggested adding pizza to their menu, and 120 students have suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who want pizza than those who want bacon. Therefore, we can say that x > y, where x is the number of students who want pizza and y is the number of students who want bacon. Now, let's find out how many more students want pizza than those who want bacon. We know that x - y = 137 (since 120 + 97 = 217). So, the difference between the number of students who want pizza and those who want bacon is 137.
Response:  If 144 students have suggested adding purée from compote, and there are 467 students who have suggested adding bechamel to macaroni, then we can say that the total number of students who have suggested adding some kind of pasta dish is 467 + 144 = 611.  As for the number of students who have suggested adding parmesan cheese, there are 79 such students. Therefore, the ratio of students who have suggested adding parmesan cheese to those who have suggested adding pasta dishes is 79/611 = 0.128 or approximately 13%.
Response:  According to the question, if 228 students suggested adding purée, then there are 228 + 337 = 565 students who have suggested adding something to the menu. Since 23 students suggested adding parmesan cheese, we can subtract that number from the total number of students who have made suggestions: 565 - 23 = 542. Therefore, more than half (542 / 2 = 271) of the students have suggested adding beef to the menu.
Response:  We know that Sofia asked students to propose certain types of food from a total of 66 options. If 450 students participated in the proposal and 41 (450 - 38) proposed adding purée, then there are 223 students who did not propose any new type of food (266 - 41). Therefore, there were 223 students who did not participate in the proposal.
Response:  If 218 students have suggested adding pizza to the menu and 351 students have suggested adding only beef stew, then there are a total of 569 students who have made suggestions (218 + 351 = 569). Therefore, the number of students who have suggested adding beef stew is 351.
Response:  According to the question, out of 269 students who answered Sofia's question, 330 students suggested adding purée to their menu, while 76 students suggested adding parmesan cheese more than twice as many students suggested adding purée than those who suggested adding beef (269 - 330 = x). Therefore, we can conclude that x = 143.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in school. So we can write this inequality: 569 > 236. Now let's simplify it: 569 - 236 = 333. Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys in school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls:  Number of boys / Number of girls = 841 / 34 = 25.67 (round to nearest whole number) So, there are approximately 26 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 228 more girl students than boy students, then the number of boy students must be equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of girl students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Boy Students = (Total Number of Students - Number of Girl Students) / 2  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of Boy Students = (697 - 228) / 2  = 469 / 2  = 234.5 So, there are 234.5 boy students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are 635 girls and 510 boys, then we can say that the number of boys is greater than the number of girls. Therefore, the answer to the question is: More than 635.
"Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 868 students in total and 281 of them are girls, then the number of boys is:

$$ \boxed{ Boys = 868 - 281 = 587 } $$

So, there are 587 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, then the total number of students in the school is:  Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total number of students = 700 + (142 - 700)  Total number of students = 700 + (-70)  Total number of students = 630 Therefore, there are 630 students in this school, including both boys and girls.
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in school. Then, another 418 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = 706 + 418 = 1124 Number of boys = 222 Therefore, the total number of students in the school is equal to the sum of the number of girls and boys: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 1124 + 222 = 1346
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls in school and 811 boys. So, the total number of students was 902 + 811 = 1713. Now, we are told that 44 more girls joined the school. Therefore, the new total number of girls in the school is 902 + 44 = 946. So, the number of girl students in the school now is 946.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls in school and 410 boys. So, if 465 girls joined the school, then we have: Number of girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 Number of boys = 410 Therefore, there are more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in school. Then, another 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school. So, now we need to find out how many girls are currently in school. To do this, we can use the information given in the question: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 732 + 761 = 1493 Now, let's subtract the new number of boys from the total number of students: Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 1493 - 761 = 732 Therefore, there are 732 girls currently in school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in school. Then, another 496 girls joined the school, so the total number of girls is now 496 + 214 = 710 girls. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of boys as follows: Initially, there were 135 boys in school. Later, another 910 boys joined the school, so the total number of boys is now 135 + 910 = 1045 boys. Therefore, there are currently 1045 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in school. If we divide the number of girls by the number of female teachers, we get: Number of female teachers = 308 / 36 = 8.5 (round up to 9) Similarly, if we divide the number of boys by the number of male teachers, we get: Number of male teachers = 318 / 36 = 9 (rounded up to 10) Therefore, there are 9 female teachers and 10 male teachers in the school. So, the total number of students in the school is: Total number of students = 308 + 318 = 626
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of students to teachers is 624:772 = 1:1. Therefore, there are 1 student for every teacher in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are more than 402 girls in this school because we were told that there are ""more than"" 739 girls. So let's assume that there are exactly 739 girls in this school. Now, if there are more than 402 girls, then there must be fewer than 402 boys. In fact, since there are 739 girls and only 402 girls, there must be 337 boys in this school!"
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 458 girl students and 692 total students, then the number of boy students must be less than 458.  Therefore, the number of male students is equal to 458 - 692 = -234.  Since negative numbers cannot be used as answers, we will round up to zero (0) for the number of male students.  So, the correct answer is: Number of male students = 0
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in school. Then, another 403 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Boys = 362 + 403 = 765 Girls = 257 + 403 = 659 Therefore, there are more girls than boys in the school by 186 (659 - 765).
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Edvard now has $2.
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, he must have spent $10 ($13 - $3 = $10).
Response:  Edward had $9 before he spent any money. Then, he spent $8 more, so he has $9 + $8 = $17 now. So, Edward had $9 before he spent any money.
Response:  Before Edward spent his money, he had $6 + x = 100 dollars, where x is the amount of money he spent on books. Since each book cost him $1, we can write: $6 + x = 100 $x = 94 $So, before spending any money, Edward had $6 + $94 = $100 dollars.
Response:  Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, so he has $6 - $6 = $0 left. Now he has $12 - $0 = $12. Each book cost him $1, since he had no money left after buying one book, and now he has $12 / 2 = $6 left after buying two books. Therefore, each book cost him $6.
Response:  Before Edward spent his money, he had $20 (19 + 1). After spending $6 on books and $16 on pens, he has $19 left ($20 - $6 - $16 = $19). So, Edward had $20 before he spent any money.
Response:  Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so he has $4 + $3 = $7 left after buying them. Therefore, Edward spent $7 on books and pens combined.
Response:  According to the problem, Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he has $19 left after buying those things. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had left: $$ \therefore \text {Amount left after buying books and pens} = 19 - 8 = 11 $$ Now, let's divide the amount he spent on books by the amount he spent on pens to get the ratio of how much he spent on books compared to pens: $$ \frac{\text{Amount spent on books}}{\text{Amount spent on pens}} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 $$ Therefore, Edward spent twice as much money on books as he did on pens.
Response:  Edward had $17 before he spent any money. Then, he received $10 from his friend. So, now he has $7 ($17 - $10). Therefore, Edward had $27 before he spent any money ($17 + $10).
"Response: 
Zachary has done 44 push-ups today and David has done 58 more than Zachary. So, David has done 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups in total."
"Response:  We know that Zachari has done 51 push-ups and David has done 44 push-ups in one hour of fitness class today. To find out how many more push-ups Zachari did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachari did:

Zachari did 51 -David did 44 = 7 more push-ups
Therefore, Zachari did 7 more push-ups than David."
Response:  David has done 44 push-ups today and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, Zachary has done 35 push-ups (44 - 9 = 35).
Response:  David has done 51 overtime today and Zackary has done 49 more than David. So, in total, they have done 51 + 49 = 100 overtimes.
Response:  We know that David did more push-ups than Zachari (19 vs 59). However, he also did fewer sit-ups than Zachari (44 vs 44). So, we can conclude that David did 10 + 23 = 33 overs. Therefore, David performed 33 overs.
Response:  We know that Zachari has done 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. David did 29 more push-ups than Zachari but 13 less crunches than him. So, if we calculate the number of cretions David made...  Push-ups: David did 29 + 44 = 73 push-ups Crunches: David did 17 - 13 = 4 crunches Therefore, David performed 73 push-ups and 4 crunches.
"Response:  We know that Zachari has done 53 push-ups and 14 sit-ups in an hour of fitness class today. David has done 17 more push-ups than Zachari but 10 fewer sit-ups. So, we can write down the information as follows:
Zachari did 53 push-ups and 14 sit-ups.
David did 17 + 14 = 31 push-ups and 10 - 14 = -4 sit-ups (since he did fewer sit-ups than Zachari).
Therefore, Zachari did 53 push-ups and -4 sit-ups."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Зацхари has done 35 overturns and 3 curls in an hour of fitness class today. Secondly, David has performed 58 more push-ups than Зацхари but 87 fewer crunches than him. Therefore, the difference between the number of crunches performed by Зацхари and David is 87 - 58 = 29. So, Зацхари has performed 29 more crunches than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 squats and 58 crunches in an hour of fitness class today. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary but had 62 fewer push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 38 push-ups. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups Zachary did and the number of push-ups David did is 62 - (x + 38).
Response:  David has done 39 more than Zackary, so David did 39 + 19 = 58 opras.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Зацхари has done 51 push-ups in an hour of fitness class today. Secondly, David has done 22 more than Зацхари, so David has done 73 push-ups (22 + 51 = 73). Thirdly, John has done 4 less than David, so John has done 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John has done 69 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Зацхари has done 15 overspans on the terrace and Dejvid has done 39 more than Зацхари. So, Dejvid has done 39 + 15 = 54 overspans on the terrace. Now we know that John has done 9 less than David. Therefore, John has done 54 - 9 = 45 overspans on the terrace. Finally, we are asked how many more push-ups Зацхари did than John. To find this, we subtract the number of overspans John did from the number of overspans Зацхари did. So, the answer is 45 (the number of overspans John did) - 15 (the number of overspans Зацхари did) = 30 more push-ups that Зацхари did than John.
Response:  We know that David has done 30 more abs exercises than Zachary today. So, if David did 30 + x = 37 abdominal crunches, then Zachary must have done x = 7 abdominal crunches.
Response:  We know that David has done more than 50 overtime shots than Zachary today in fitness class. So if David did 38 shots, then Zachary must have done x = 17 shots (since their total is 56). Therefore, the answer is x = 17.
"Response:  We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer crunches than Zachary per hour of fitness class today. So if Zachary did 34 sit-ups and 62 crunches in an hour, then David did:

David did 34 + 40 = 74 sit-ups in an hour.
And David did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches in an hour."
"Response:  David did 36 more sit-ups than Zachary today, but he also did 33 fewer sit-ups per hour than Zachary. So if Zachary did 58 overs and 33 crunches in total, then David did:

David did 58 - 33 = 25 overs and 0 crunches."
Response:  David has done more than 27 overtime cancellations but less than 7 more than Zachary in fitness classes today. If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 movements, how many more movements does he have to do to surpass David?  We know that David did 27 more overtime cancellations than Zachary, so if Zachary did x movements, then David did 27 + x movements. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: 27 + x = 34 (since David did 34 movements). Solving for x, we get: x = 6. So, Zachary needs to do 6 more movements to surpass David.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to finish 5 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages of homework in reading. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
Mathematics = 5 pages
Reading = 2 pages
Now, let's solve for the difference between the number of pages in mathematics and the number of pages in reading:
Difference = Mathematics - Reading
= 5 - 2
= 3 pages
Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading."
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to finish 3 pages of homework in mathematics and 4 pages of homework in reading. So, we can write this as an equation:

Mathematics = 3 pages
Reading = 4 pages
Now, let's convert both equations into fractions or decimals so that we can compare them directly:

Mathematics = 3/1 = 3
Reading = 4/1 = 4
As you can see, there is no difference between the number of pages for mathematics and reading, so they are equal. Therefore, the answer is:

Homework in Reading = Homework in Mathematics (equal)"
Response:  If Rejcheal has to finish 5 pages of homework in mathematics and additional pages for reading, then she needs to finish a total of 7 pages of homework. Since each page of homework is equal to one page of reading, we can conclude that Rejcheal needs to finish 7/1 = 7 pages of reading. Therefore, the answer is 7 pages.
"Response:  If Rejchele was required to finish 7 pages of homework for mathematics and she finished 4 more pages of homework than reading assignments, then...

1. The number of pages of homework for mathematics is 7.
2. The number of pages of reading assignments is x.
3. The total number of pages of homework is 7 + x.

Since Rejchele finished 4 more pages of homework than reading assignments, we can write an equation based on this information:

Total number of pages of homework = Number of pages of homework for mathematics + Number of pages of homework for reading

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

7 + x = Total number of pages of homework

Solving for x, we find that:

x = 3

Therefore, Rejchele had to complete 3 pages of reading assignments."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to finish 8 pages of homework for mathematics. If she finished 3 more pages than she read, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages read = 8 - 3 = 5 pages. Therefore, Rachel read 5 pages of homework in total.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 8 pages of homework for mathematics and she finished 6 pages more than what was required. So, if the requirement was x pages, then we can write an equation as follows:

x = 8 - 6

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, Rachel had to finish 2 pages more than the required amount of homework in mathematics."
"Response:  If Rejchele had to finish 10 pages of homework for mathematics and she finished 3 more pages of domestic tasks than mathematics, then we can write an equation as follows:
Pages finished for mathematics = 10
Pages finished for domestic tasks = Pages finished for mathematics + 3
Where P is a variable representing the number of pages finished for domestic tasks.
Now, we are given that Rejchele finished 3 more pages of domestic tasks than mathematics, so we can rewrite the equation as:
Pages finished for domestic tasks = Pages finished for mathematics + 3
Substituting the value of P from the problem statement into this equation gives us:
Pages finished for domestic tasks = 10 + 3
= 13
Therefore, Rejchele finished 13 pages of domestic tasks in addition to the 10 pages of homework for mathematics."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rejche has to finish 2 pages of homework from mathematics, which means she needs to complete 4 pages (since there are 2 pages per task).  Secondly, we know that she has to finish 3 pages of homework from reading, so she needs to complete another 3 pages. Finally, we know that she has to finish 10 pages of homework from biology, which is equal to 50 pages (since there are 5 pages per task). Therefore, in total, Rejche needs to complete 4 + 3 + 50 = 67 pages of homework.
"Response:  We know that Rejche has to finish 9 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages in reading. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is:

Mathematics: 9 pages x 1 page/page = 9 pages
Reading: 2 pages x 1 page/page = 2 pages
Total number of pages: 9 + 2 = 11 pages
Therefore, Rejche has more pages of homework in biology than in mathematics or reading combined."
Response:  According to the question, Rejche has to finish 11 pages of homework in total.  We know that she has to do 2 pages of homework in mathematics and 3 pages in biology. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Mathematics = 2 pages Biology = 3 pages Total = 11 pages So, the number of more pages of homework in mathematics than in biology is:  Mathematics - Biology = 2 pages - 3 pages = 1 page Therefore, there are 1 more page of homework in mathematics than in biology.
Response:  We know that Rejche has to finish 7 pages of homework from mathematics, 11 pages from reading and 8 pages from biology. So in total she needs to finish 7 + 11 + 8 = 26 pages of homework. Therefore, Rejche has more homework from mathematics than from biology.
Response:  We know that Rejche has to finish 9 pages of homework in mathematics and 11 pages of homework in reading. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Mathematics = 9 pages Reading = 11 pages Now, we are also given that Rejche has to complete 29 additional pages of homework in biology. So, let's add this to our previous equations: Biology = 29 pages Total Homework = Mathematics + Reading + Biology Substituting the values we have obtained from the problem statement into these equations gives us: Mathematics = 9 pages Reading = 11 pages Biology = 29 pages Total Homework = 9 + 11 + 29 = 59 pages Therefore, Rejche needs to complete 59 pages of homework altogether.
Response:  We know that Rejche has to finish 8 pages of homework in mathematics and 7 pages in reading. Therefore, she needs to complete 15 pages of homework (8 + 7 = 15). However, we are also given that she has to do an additional 3 pages of homework for biology. So, in total, Rejche needs to complete 18 pages of homework (15 + 3 = 18).
Response:  We know that Rejche has to finish 5 pages of homework in mathematics, which means she needs to complete 5/10 = 0.5 pages of reading and 6/10 = 0.6 pages of biology homework. So, Rejche needs to finish 0.5 + 0.6 = 1 page of homework in reading and 1 + 0.6 = 1.6 pages of homework in biology. Therefore, Rejche needs to finish 1 page of homework in reading and 1.6 pages of homework in biology.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to finish 2 pages of homework for reading and 4 pages of homework for mathematics. So, in total, she had to finish 6 pages of homework (2 + 4 = 6). Therefore, the number of more pages of homework for mathematics than for reading is 6 - 2 = 4.
Response:  We know that Rejche has to finish 4 pages of homework for reading and 7 pages for mathematics. So, in total, she needs to finish 4 + 7 = 11 pages of homework. Now, we are asked how many more pages of homework Rejche had to do for biology than for mathematics. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of pages of homework for mathematics from the total number of pages of homework required, which is 11 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages of homework for mathematics and biology is: 11 - 7 = 4 pages. Therefore, Rejche had 4 more pages of homework for biology than for mathematics.
Response: Џек has received 6 e-mails in the morning and 2 e-mails in the afternoon. Therefore, he has received a total of 8 e-mails (6 + 2). So, the difference between the number of e-mails he received in the morning and the number of e-mails he received in the afternoon is 0 (since they are equal). Therefore, there is no difference between the two times.
Response: Џек has received 6 e-mails in the morning and 8 e-mails in the afternoon. So, he has received a total of 6 + 8 = 14 e-mails. Therefore, he has received more e-mails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response: Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 4 + x emails during the day, where x is the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon. Since we are told that Jack received 5 emails in total during the day, we can set up the equation: 4 + x = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. Therefore, Jack received 5 emails in total during the day, including both the ones he received in the morning and those he received in the afternoon.
Response: Џек has received 6 e-mails in the morning and 3 e-mails in the afternoon for a total of 9 e-mails. Therefore, he has received an average of 9/2 = 4.5 e-mails per day.
Response: Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 72 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 75 emails (5 + 72). Therefore, Jack received 3 emails in the morning (5 - 4 = 3) and 69 emails in the evening (72 - 3 = 69).
Response: Џек has received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon for a total of 9 emails. Therefore, he has received 9 emails in total. So, he has received 3 emails in the afternoon (5 - 4 = 3).
Response: Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 7 emails (3 + 4 = 7). Therefore, Jack received 7 emails that day.
Response: Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 10 + 7 = 17 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response: Jack received 9 e-mails in the morning and 10 e-mails in the afternoon for a total of 19 e-mails. Therefore, he received more e-mails in the afternoon than in the morning by 1 email (10 - 9 = 1). So, Jack received one more e-mail in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response: Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 15 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). He also received 4 emails in the evening. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the daytime than in the evening. The difference between the number of emails he received in the daytime and evening is: 15 - 4 = 11 emails. So, Jack received 11 more emails during the daytime than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the day. Therefore, Jack received 9/2 = 4.5 emails per hour on average during the day.
Response: Џек has received 3 e-mails and 64 letters in the morning, so he has received a total of 67 messages (3 + 64 = 67). Then, he has received 5 more e-mails and 54 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 121 messages (5 + 54 = 121). So, Џек has received a total of 121 messages per day.
Response: Џек has received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he has received a total of 11 messages (5 + 6 = 11). Then, he has received 9 more emails and 7 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 16 messages (9 + 7 = 16). Therefore, Џек has received a total of 16 messages during the day (11 + 16 = 27).
Response: Џек has received 10 e-mails in the morning and then he received 3 more e-mails in the afternoon. So, the total number of e-mails that Jack has received is:  Morning = 10 + 3 = 13 E-mails In the afternoon, Jack has received 44 letters. Therefore, the difference between the number of e-mails Jack received in the morning and the number of letters he received in the afternoon is: Difference = Number of letters - Number of e-mails = 44 - 13 = 31 letters
Response: Џек has received 6 e-mails and 8 letters in the morning, so he has received a total of 6 + 8 = 14 messages in the morning. Then, he has received 2 more e-mails and 7 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 2 + 7 = 9 additional messages. Therefore, Џек has received a total of 14 + 9 = 23 messages during the day.
Response: Џек has received 6 e-mails in total and sent 91 letters in total. So, he has sent more letters than he has received. Therefore, we can say that his average number of emails per day is less than or equal to the number of letters he sent. We know from the problem statement that Jack sent 74 letters after lunchtime, so his average number of emails per day is (74 / 2) = 37 emails per day.  Therefore, Џек has received 37 emails per day.
Response: Jack received 4 emails in the morning and sent 2 letters, so he received + sent = 6 emails. Then he received 6 more emails and sent 8 letters, so he received + sent = 14 emails total. Therefore, Jack sent 4 emails per day (morning + afternoon).
Response: Jack received 9 emails in total during the day. If he received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then we can assume that Jack received an additional 2 emails in the afternoon (since 9 - 7 = 2). Therefore, Jack received a total of 7 + 2 = 9 emails during the day.
"Response: Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 8 emails that day. Since he also received 16 emails in the evening, we can conclude that Jack received more emails in the evening than he did in the morning or afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the evening is:

Morning: 5 - Afternoon: 3 = 2
So, Jack received 2 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning."
Response:  Jack received three emails in the afternoon and six emails in the morning, so he received a total of 9 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 9/2 = 4.5 emails per hour on average during the day.
"Response:  The distance traveled by the frog is given as 12 inches and that of the snake is 9 inches. So, we need to find out how much longer the frog jumped than the snake. We can do this by subtracting the length of the snake from the length of the frog:

Distance traveled by frog = 12 inches - 9 inches = 3 inches

So, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the snake."
Response:  Сkaл has jumped 30 centimeters and the frog 35 centimeters. So in total they have jumped 30 + 35 = 65 centimeters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that ska...
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 18 inches further than the snake (25 - 18 = 7). So, the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the distance traveled by the frog minus the distance traveled by the snake. Therefore, the mouse traveled 7 + 2 = 9 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that ska...
Response:  Firstly, we know that ska...
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 32 inches further than the snake (since the snake could only jump 25 inches). So, the distance traveled by the frog is: 32 - 25 = 7 inches. Now, we also know that the mouse jumped less than the frog by 26 inches. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is: 7 - 26 = -19 inches. Since negative numbers indicate leftward movement, the mouse moved leftward by 19 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that ska...
Response:  Сkaкал has jumped 13 inches (0.27 meters). The frog has jumped 5 centimeters further than the snake (5 x 0.27 = 1.35 meters). So, the distance traveled by the frog is 1.35 meters.
Response:  Сkaкал has jumped 35 inches and then the frogs have jumped 4 inches more than him. So, in total, they have jumped 39 inches (35 + 4).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of SkaCal is 19 inches and he is 4 inches ahead of Frog. So, the distance between SkaCal and Frog is 15 inches (19 - 4 = 15). Now, we are told that Mouse jumped 44 inches less than Frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by Frog is equal to the distance traveled by Mouse minus 44 inches. Hence, the distance traveled by Frog is 15 + 44 = 59 inches. So, Frog has traveled 59 inches in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the mouse jumped less than 12 inches. So, the difference between their jumps is 39 - 12 = 27 inches. Now, we are told that the frog was 19 inches away from the mouse after its first jump. Therefore, the distance between the frog and the mouse after the second jump (i.e., the distance traveled by the mouse) is 27 - 19 = 8 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between ska...
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the snake slid 17 inches. To find out how far away from the snake the frog landed, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the snake (in this case, 17 inches) from the distance traveled by the frog (in this case, 39 inches). So, the distance between the frog and the snake is:  Distance = 39 - 17 = 22 inches. Therefore, the frog landed 22 inches away from the snake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 20 centimeters more than the snake (9 inches x 2.54 = 23 cm). So, the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the difference between the distances traveled by the frog and the snake. Therefore, the mouse jumped 47 centimeters (20 - 23) away from its starting point.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 37 inches more than the snake (since it was 14 inches shorter). So, the total distance traveled by the frog is: 37 + 14 = 51 inches. Now, we are told that the mouse has jumped less than the frog. This means that the distance traveled by the mouse is smaller than 51 inches. However, since we don't have any information about how much less, we can't determine exactly how far the mouse jumped. Therefore, our answer is ""less than 51 inches""."
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Meri has already added 5 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total required:

14 - 5 = 9

So, Meri needs to add 9 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. She has already added 4 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how much more sugar she should add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (11 cups) by the amount of flour added so far (4 cups): 11 / 4 = 2.75 cups. Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 2.75 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She has already added some flour but still needs more than she has. So we need to find out how much more flour she needs.  To do this, we can divide the amount of remaining flour needed by the amount of flour required per cup of brachna. This will give us the number of cups of flour left to be added.  In this case, if Meri needs 8 additional cups of flour, and there are 4 cups of flour in each cup of bran, then she needs 2 cups of flour (8/4 = 2). Therefore, Meri needs an additional 2 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Meri needs 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar for her recipe. She has already put in some flour but doesn't know how much more she needs. To find out, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining cups = Total amount needed - Amount already given / Amount already given x 100% So, if Meri needs 11 cups of flour and has already put in some (let's say 3 cups), then the number of remaining cups is: Number of remaining cups = 11 - 3 / 3 x 100% = 8 cups If Meri needs 7 cups of sugar and has already put in some (let's say 2 cups), then the number of remaining cups is: Number of remaining cups = 7 - 2 / 2 x 100% = 5 cups Therefore, Meri still needs 8 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.

Question: Мери пече торту. Рецепт захтева 11 шољица шећера и јошneoколо других шољица брашна. Već je stavila 3 шоље brašna. Ako joj je još potrebno dobiti 6 шoљица brašна, koliko šoљица brašна je recept zahtjevao?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.
Answer: Let's think step by step. If Meri has already added 3 spoons of flour, which is equal to 3/4 of one spoon, then she needs to add 6 - 3 = 3 additional spoons of flour. So, the answer is 3 spoons of flour."
Response:  If Meri has already put in several spoons of flour and the recipe requires 12 spoons of flour, then she needs 6 more spoons of flour (12 - 5 = 6). So, if she still needs 2 spoons of flour, it means that she has put in 4 spoons of flour so far (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar.  Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required: 3 - 62 = -60. So, Mary needs to add 60 more cups of flour.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar.  Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

Total amount of sugar needed = 14 cups - 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 cups of sugar more."
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 cups of flour and Meri has already added 11 cups. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour are required. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour needed (12 cups) by the amount of flour Meri has already added (11 cups):

Number of additional cups = Total amount of flour needed / Amount of flour added = 12 cups / 11 cups = 1 cup

So, Meri needs to add one more cup of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 10 cups of flour, but she has already added 7 cups. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour are required. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour needed (10 cups) by the amount of flour Meri has already added (7 cups):

Number of additional cups of flour = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour already added
= 10 cups - 7 cups
= 3 cups
Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Meri has already added 2 tablespoons of flour to the recipe, which means she needs to add 10 more tablespoons (12 - 2 = 10) to complete the recipe. Since each table spoon of flour requires 3 times as much salt as flour, we need to multiply 10 by 3 to get the number of tablespoons of salt needed: 10 x 3 = 30 tablespoons of salt. Therefore, Meri needs to add 30 tablespoons of salt to the recipe instead of 7 tablespoons.
Response:  We know that Meri has already added 5 spoons of flour (out of 6 required). So, to find out how many spoons of sugar she needs to add, we can use the following formula: Number of spoons of sugar = Total amount of sugar / Amount of flour already used x 100. In this case, the total amount of sugar is 8 spoons and the amount of flour already used is 5 spoons, so we can calculate the number of spoons of sugar needed as follows: Number of spoons of sugar = 8 - 5 x 100 = 3 spoons of sugar. Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 3 spoons of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar.  Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (13 cups) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2 cups):

13 / 2 = 6.5

So, Mary needs to add 6.5 additional cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Meri has already added 4 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount required:

Total amount of flour needed = 9 cups - 4 cups = 5 cups

Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She has already added 2 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she should add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour required (9 cups) by the amount of flour she has already added (2 cups): 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups. Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 4.5 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She has already added 11 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how much more sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (5 cups) by the amount of flour she has already added (11 cups): 5/11 = 0.45 or 45%. Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 0.45 x 5 = 2.25 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Meri needs 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour for her recipe. She has already put in some flour (but we don't know how much). So, to find out if she still needs more flour, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already used from the total amount needed. In this case, the difference is: 3 - x = 10 where x is the amount of flour Meri has already used. Now, since x is unknown, we can't determine exactly how many cups of flour Meri needs. However, we do know that x must be greater than 0 because Meri cannot have negative amounts of flour. Therefore, the answer is: Yes, Meri needs at least 5 cups of flour more than what she has already used.
Response:  If Meri has already put in several spoons of flour and the recipe requires 13 spoons, then she still needs to add 9 more spoons (13 - 4 = 9). So, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 shots of flour and 6 shots of sugar.  Mary has already added 7 shots of flour and 60 shots of sugar. So we need to find out how many more shots of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (60) by the amount of sugar Mary has already added (60). This gives us 1 shot of flour per 10 shots of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more shots of flour (14 - 7 = 5).
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour.  Mary has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

11 - 10 = 1
So, Mary needs to add 1 cup of sugar more."
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 3 cups of sugar, and Meri has already added 6 cups of flour (which is equal to 6/4 = 1.5 cups). So, we need to subtract what she has already added from the total amount required. Therefore, the remaining amount of flour needed is:

Total amount of flour required = 3 cups - 1.5 cups = 1.5 cups

So, Meri needs to add an additional 1.5 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 9 cups of sugar, 14 cups of flour, and 40 cups of salt. She has already added 4 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she should add, we can divide the total amount required (9 + 14 + 40) by the amount she has already added (4). So, Meri needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour (9 / 4 = 2.25, round up to 3 cups). Therefore, the correct answer is 3 cups of flour more than what Meri has already added.
"Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 9 cups of sugar, 7 cups of flour, and 4 cups of salt. She has already added 2 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she should add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

Total amount of flour needed = 9 - 2 = 7 cups
So, Meri needs to add 5 more cups of flour (7 - 2 = 5)."
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar, 6 cups of flour, and 9 cups of salt. She has already added 12 cups of flour, which is more than the required amount. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required in the recipe. So, the difference between 6 cups (the amount of flour she has already added) and 6 cups (the total amount of flour required in the recipe) is equal to 6 - 12 = -6 cups of flour. Since the negative value indicates that Meri has too much flour, we need to subtract it from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe. Therefore, the number of extra cups of sugar needed is -6 / 6 = -1 cup of sugar.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. Meri has already added 4 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total required:

Total required = 7 cups + 10 cups = 17 cups
Amount already added = 4 cups

So, Meri needs to add 13 more cups of sugar (17 - 4 = 13)."
"Response:  We know that Meri needs to make a torte and the recipe requires 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She has already added 10 cups of sugar. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount required:

14 cups - 10 cups = 4 cups

So, Meri needs to add 4 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that 19 families of birds live near the mountain and 60 bird families have flown away for winter. So, we can say that the number of bird families remaining is equal to the number of bird families flying away minus the number of bird families living nearby.  Therefore, the answer is: Number of bird families remaining = 60 - 19 = 41.
Response:  If 7 pigeon families flew away for winter and 87 bird families stayed near the mountain, then we can assume that there are 80 bird families left behind (7 + 87 = 94). So, the number of bird families remaining is 94 - 7 = 87. Therefore, more than twice as many bird families remained in the area compared to those who migrated for winter.
"Response:  We know that 20 pigeon families migrated to warmer climates and 14 pigeon families stayed behind. So, if we assume that each family consists of an average of 5 birds (which is a reasonable assumption), then the total number of birds living near the mountain at the beginning of winter would be:

20 families x 5 birds/family = 100 birds

Therefore, there were 100 birds living near the mountain at the beginning of winter."
"Response:  We know that 85 families of birds live near the mountain. If 23 families flew to Africa and 37 families flew to Asia, then we have:

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25 families

Therefore, there are 25 families of birds remaining near the mountain after some families migrated to Africa or Asia."
Response:  We know that:  - 8 families of birds live near the mountain.  - 42 families of birds flew to Africa and 31 families flew to Asia. So, we have:  Number of families of birds that flew to Africa = 42 Number of families of birds that flew to Asia = 31 Now, let's find out how many more families of birds flew to Africa than to Asia: Difference between number of families that flew to Africa and number of families that flew to Asia = 42 - 31 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 more families of birds that flew to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that:  * 38 families of birds live near the mountain. * 47 families of birds flew to Africa. * 94 families of birds flew to Asia. Now we need to find out how many more families of birds flew to Asia than to Africa. To do this, we will divide the number of families that flew to Asia (94) by the number of families that flew to Africa (47). So, the result is 94/47 = 2.06. Therefore, there are 2.06 times more families of birds that flew to Asia than to Africa.
"Response:  We know that:

* 18 families of birds live near the mountain.
* 38 families of birds flew to Africa and 80 families flew to Asia.

So, we have:

18 + 38 = 56 families of birds that migrated away from the mountain.

Now, let's find out how many families of birds remained near the mountain:

56 - 80 = -24 families of birds (since 80 is greater than 56).

Therefore, there are -24 families of birds that remained near the mountain."
Response:  If лето is almost here and most animals return to colder climates, then there are currently 87 families of birds living near the mountain. If 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain will be: 87 + 18 = 105 families of birds.
Response:  We know that 49 families of birds live near the mountain and 59 families have migrated to warmer lands. This means that 10 families (49 - 59) of birds are still near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 27 bird families have migrated to warmer lands and left the mountain. So, initially, there were 41 bird families living near the mountain. Now, we need to find out how many bird families are still living near the mountain after 27 families have migrated. To do this, we can divide the initial number of bird families (41) by the number of families that have migrated (27): Number of bird families remaining = Initial number of families / Number of families that migrated = 41 / 27 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 bird families still living near the mountain after 27 families have migrated to warmer lands.
Response:  At first, there were 86 families of birds that migrated to warmer lands for winter. Then, 45 families remained near the mountain. So, the total number of families of birds that did not migrate is 86 - 45 = 41. Therefore, more families of birds migrated away than stayed behind.
Response:  We know that 41 bird families live near the mountain and 35 of them have flown to Asia. So, there are 41 - 35 = 6 bird families left in the area. Now we need to find out how many more birds flew to Africa than to Asia. According to the passage, 62 pigeon families flew to Africa, which is more than the number of bird families that flew to Asia (35). Therefore, the difference between the number of birds that flew to Africa and those that flew to Asia is 62 - 35 = 27. So, there are 27 more birds that flew to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that three families of birds live near the mountain and have not migrated south for winter.  Therefore, there are 3 families of birds living nearby the mountain.  Now we learn that 26 new families of birds have arrived from the Arctic to live near the mountain.  So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now:  3 + 26 = 39 families of birds.  Therefore, there are 39 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that Pol received a box of 253 pens for his birthday and lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, we need to find out how many pens are left after subtracting the number he lost/gave away from the initial amount. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of pens remaining = Initial number of pens - Number of pens lost/given away Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pens remaining = 253 - 70 = 183 pens remain After substituting these values, we get the final answer: There are 183 pens remaining at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Pol has lost or given away 551 of his 608 colored pencils until now he has only 177 left. So, if we divide the number of remaining pencils (177) by the total number of pencils (608), we get:  Number of pencils Pol had for his birthday = 177 / 608 = 29  Therefore, Pol had 29 colored pencils in the gift box for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Pol received 440 oak leaves for his birthday and gave away 111 to his friends during the school year. Therefore, he lost 106 oak leaves. So, the number of oak leaves left is: 440 - 106 = 334 oak leaves.
Response:  If Pol received 65 oak leaves for his birthday and gave away 213 during the school year while losing 16, then we can calculate as follows:  Total number of oak leaves given = 213 Total number of oak leaves lost = 16 So, the total number of oak leaves that Pol has is:  Total number of oak leaves = Total number of oak leaves given - Total number of oak leaves lost = 213 - 16 = 197 oak leaves. Therefore, Pol has 197 oak leaves in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol has given away 571 oak leaves to his friends during the school year. On the other hand, he lost 161 oak leaves. Therefore, the difference between the number of oak leaves he gave away and those he lost is equal to 571 - 161 = 410 oak leaves. So, Pol gave more oak leaves to his friends than he lost.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol has given away 90 oak leaves to his friends during the school year. Therefore, he has lost 412 - 90 = 322 oak leaves. So, Pol has lost more oak leaves than he gave away to his friends.
Response:  We know that Pol has given away 563 olovki to his friends during the school year and lost 558 olovki. So he has 332 olovki left. Now we need to find out how many olovki he received for his birthday. According to the question, he received 50 olovki more than the number of olovki he gave away during the school year. Therefore, if he gave away 563 olovki, he received 563 - 563 = 0 olovki for his birthday. So he has 332 + 0 = 332 olovki left.
Response:  We know that Pol had 492 olovki at the beginning of the school year and gave away or lost 535 olovki during the same period. So, if he had only 492 olovki to start with, how many did he have left after giving them away or losing them?  The answer is 492 - (535) = 143. Therefore, Pol lost or gave away 143 olovki.
"Response:  We know that initially Pol had 521 oak leaves and 66 sticks for his birthday gift. If he didn't lose any oak leaves during the school year, then at the end of the year he would have 521 - 0 = 521 oak leaves left. However, we are told that he lost some oak leaves, so let's assume that he lost x oak leaves. Therefore, the total number of oak leaves Pol has at the end of the year is 521 - x. Now, we also know that each stick can hold 66 oak leaves, so if Pol didn't give away or lose any sticks during the school year, then he would have 66 / 66 = 1 stick left at the end of the year. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of oak leaves given to Pol = 521 - x; Number of sticks given to Pol = 1."
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 531 oak leaves and 38 sticks of incense. After losing some of them, he was left with 391 oak leaves and no incense. So, we can calculate how many more oak leaves than guidelines remained as follows: Number of remaining oak leaves = Initial number of oak leaves - Number of lost oak leaves = 531 - (38 + number of oak leaves lost) = 531 - 38 - x = 493 Where x is the number of oak leaves that Pol lost. Since Pol did not lose any incense, the number of guidelines remains unchanged at 38. Therefore, the final answer is: More oak leaves than guidelines remain = 493 - 38 = 455.
Response:  We know that initially, Pol had 601 oak leaves and 406 pins for his birthday. After losing some of them due to misfortune (he didn't mention how many), he was left with 336 items in total. Now, let's calculate how many more pins than oak leaves he has: Number of pins = 406 - number of lost pins Number of oak leaves = 601 - number of lost oak leaves Since we don't know how many pins he lost, we can assume any value between 0 and 406. Therefore, there are infinitely many possibilities for the final result. However, if we want to find an exact answer, we need to make some assumptions about the number of pins lost. For example, if we assume that he lost half of the pins (203), then the number of pins remaining would be: Number of pins = 406 - 203 = 103 And the number of oak leaves remaining would be: Number of oak leaves = 601 - 203 = 398 So, in this case, there are 103 more pins than oak leaves left. If you want to explore other scenarios or assumptions, feel free to do so!
Response:  We know that Pol has 315 colored pencils and he gave or lost some of them until the end of the school year. So, we can write an equation: 315 - x = 291 where x is the number of colored pencils Pol had at the end of the school year. Now, we are asked to find out how many colored pencils Pol received for his birthday. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of colored pencils Pol had at the beginning of the school year from the total number of colored pencils he had at the end of the school year: 315 - x = 291 Substituting the value of x from the previous equation into this one gives us: 315 - (291) = 24 Therefore, Pol received 24 colored pencils for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Pol has received 267 envelopes for his birthday and lost 231 of them during the school year. So he has 34 envelopes left (267 - 231 = 34). Now we need to find out how many more envelopes he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of envelopes he lost from the total number of envelopes he had: 34 - 231 = -193. Therefore, Pol gave away more envelopes than he lost (-193).
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 457 guilders and 320 erasers for his birthday. After school year ended, he was left with only 523 docks without losing any of them. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of erasers = Initial number of erasers - Number of erasers lost (or gained) Number of erasers lost = Total number of erasers at the end of the school year - Number of erasers Pol had initially Number of erasers lost = 523 - 457 = 66 Now, let's find out how many more erasers than guilders Pol has: Number of erasers more than guilders = Number of erasers lost - Number of guilders Number of erasers more than guilders = 66 - 457 = -391 Therefore, there are 391 more erasers than guilders in Pol's possession.
Response:  At first, one kelner had 11 customers. Then, some of them left, so he had fewer customers. After that, he still had 3 customers. To find out how many more customers remained from those who stayed, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers he had at first. So, the answer is: Number of more customers = Total number of customers at first - Number of customers who left = 11 - x Where x is the number of customers who left. Since we are given that he still had 3 customers after they left, we can substitute this value into the equation: Number of more customers = 11 - 3 = 8 Therefore, there were 8 more customers remaining from those who stayed.
Response:  At first, one kelner had three customers. After some of them left, he still had 4 customers. So, the number of customers that left is equal to the number of customers he still has. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  At first, the kelner had 1 cupcake. Then, 9 customers bought cups from him, leaving him with 12 customers and no remaining cups. So, at the beginning, he had 1 cupcake.
Response:  We know that initially there were 14 customers and after 5 left, there were 5 remaining customers. So, if we want to find out how many more customers he had originally, we can subtract the number of customers who left from the initial total: 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, the kelner had 9 more customers originally.
Response:  At first, the kelner had 13 customers. Then, some of them left and he gained 4 new clients. So, the total number of customers is now: 13 - (some who left) + 4 =? We don't know exactly how many customers left, so we will assume that they left half of the original amount, which is 6 (since 7 - 6 = 1). Therefore, the total number of customers is: 13 - 6 + 4 = 9. So, the kelner has 9 customers remaining.
Response:  At first, the kelner had 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, so he had 12 - 15 = -3 customers less. Now, he got 14 new customers, so he has +14 = 17 customers in total.
Response:  At first, one kelner had three customers. Then, more customers arrived and he had 8 customers in total. So, the number of new customers who came is equal to 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, the kelner had 8 customers. Then, some of them left, leaving him with 5 customers. Finally, he got 99 new customers. So, the total number of customers he had at the end is: 8 + (5 - 1) = 8 + 4 = 12 customers. Therefore, the kelner has 12 customers remaining.
Response:  At first, the kelner had 12 customers. Then, some of them left, leaving him with 14 customers. Finally, he got 10 new customers. So, his total number of customers is: 12 + (14 - 3) = 15 customers.
Response:  Dan had $3 after buying chocolate for $2. So he had $3 - $2 = $1 left. Therefore, he had $1 at the beginning.
Response:  Dan had $4 initially and spent $1 on chocolate. So he has $3 left ($4 - $1 = $3). Therefore, the cost of one piece of chocolate is $3 / 3 = $1 per piece.
Response:  Dan has $4. He spent $3 on chocolates, so he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolate bars for $4 each. So, in total, he spent $8. Now we need to find out how much each chocolate bar cost. To do this, we can divide the amount of money he spent ($8) by the number of chocolate bars he bought (2). Therefore, each chocolate bar cost $4.
Response:  Dan has $2. He spent $6 on sweets, so he has $2 - $6 = $4 left. Each sweet costs $3, so he can buy $\frac{4}{3}$ sweets. Therefore, Danny bought $\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$ sweets.
Response:  Danyou have $7. You spend $2 for a bounbon and $3 for chocolate. So you are left with $7 - $2 - $3 = $2. Therefore, there is $2 remaining.
Response:  Danyou has $4. He buys a bonbon for $7 and chocolate for $6. So he spends a total of $13 ($7 + $6). Therefore, he spent $13 / $4 = $3.25 on chocolate.
Response:  Danny has $2. He buys a bonbon for $6 and chocolate for $3. So he spends a total of $8. Therefore, he spent twice as much money on chocolate than on bonbons.
Response:  Danyou spent $2 on bubble gum and $3 on chocolate. So he spent a total of $2 + $3 = $5. Therefore, Dan has $5 - $5 = $0 left after buying both items.
Response:  Dan had $4 initially. He bought chocolate for $8, so he spent $8 - $4 = $4. Now he has $4 left. His friend gave him $5 more, so now he has $4 + $5 = $9.
Response:  If Dan had $3 with him after buying chocolate and he spent $2 on it, then he has $1 left ($3 - $2 = $1). So, the cost of the chocolate is $2.
Response:  Dan has $4 and spent $3 for 10 chocolates, each costing the same amount of money. So, he spent a total of $3 x 10 = $30. This means that he has $4 - $30 = $1 left.
Response:  Dan has $3. He spent $2 for each of the two chocolate bars, so he spent a total of $2 + $2 = $4. Therefore, each chocolate bar cost half of the amount that Dan had, or $3 / 2 = $1.50.
Response:  Dan has $5. He spends $3 on chocolate and $7 on bonbons. So he has $5 - $3 = $2 left after buying both. Therefore, he spent $2 on chocolate and $5 - $7 = $-2 on bonbons.
Response:  Dan has $4. He spends $7 on chocolate, so he now has $4 - $7 = $3 left. Then, he buys a bonbon for $2, so he now has $3 - $2 = $1 left. Therefore, Dan spent $7 on chocolate and $2 on a bonbon, so he spent a total of $9.
"Response:  We know that Pol had 115 books initially and sold 78 of them at the garage sale. So, we have to find out how many books are left with him now. To do this, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had. Therefore, the number of books left with Pol is:

115 - 78 = 37

So, there are 37 books left with Pol after the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books in a garage sale, he had 105 left. So, if he started with x books, we can write an equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 269
So, Pol had 269 books at the beginning."
Response:  We know that Pol had initially 108 books and after selling some of them at a garage sale he sold x books. Since he gave 35 books to his friend, he has 62 books left. So we can write an equation: 108 - x = 62. Now we solve for x: x = 46. Therefore, Pol sold 46 books at the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Pol had 50 books initially and after buying some at a garage sale he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation:

Pol initial books = 50
New number of books = 151 - Number of books bought

Now, we need to find out how many books Pol bought. To do this, we can use the information given in the question:

Number of books bought = New number of books - Pol initial books
= 151 - 50
= 101

Therefore, Pol bought 101 books at the garage sale."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol had 2 books initially. Then he sold some of them and bought new ones. So, let's say he sold x books and bought y new ones. Now, we have the following equation: Number of books Pol has = 2 + (x - y) We are also given that Pol now has 58 books in total. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation: 2 + (x - y) = 58 Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: x - y = 56 Divide both sides by x to find y: y = 56 / x Now, we know that Pol sold x books and bought y new ones. Since he has 58 books in total, the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought is equal to the number of books he already had: x - y = 58 - 2 = 56 So, Pol sold 3 books and bought 130 new ones.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 21 books and sold some of them in a garage sale. After the garage sale, he bought 42 new books. So, we can write an equation:  Initially, Pol had 21 books = 21 x 100% = 2100 books Sold some books in a garage sale = -x% (where x is the number of books sold) Now, Pol has 15 books = 15 x 100% = 1500 books Bought 42 new books = 42 x 100% = 4200 books Total number of books = Initial + Sold + New = 2100 + (-x) + 4200 = 3720 books Therefore, Pol sold 680 books (2100 - (-x)) in the garage sale.
Response:  First, we know that Pol had 71 books initially and then sold some of them in a garage sale. We don't know how many he sold, but let's assume it was x books. Now, after selling those books, he bought 38 new ones. So, his total number of books is now 71 + 38 = 109 books. Since he has more books now than he did before (109 - 71 = 38), we can conclude that he bought more books than he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of books he bought and the number he sold is equal to 38.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he has 66 books and 59 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Books = 108 - x Pens = 55 - y Where x is the number of books sold at the garage sale, and y is the number of pens sold. Now, we are asked to find out how many books Pol sold at the garage sale. To do this, we need to solve the above equation for x. Cross-multiplying, we get: x = 108 - 66 = 42 Books were sold at the garage sale. Therefore, the answer is (42).
Response:  Pavle had initially 106 olovki and sold some of them at garage sale. After selling those olovki, he was left with 14 olovki. So, he sold x olovki at the garage sale. Since he started with 106 olovki, we can write an equation: 106 - x = 14. Solving for x, we get: x = 92. Therefore, Pavle sold 92 olovki at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Pol had 136 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Since he has 27 books left after selling some, we can write an equation: 136 - x = 27. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 136: x / 136 = 27 / 136. Simplifying, we get x = 9. So, Pol sold 9 books at the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Pol had initially 134 books and after giving some to his friend he was left with 68 books. So, we can write an equation:

Number of books Pol sold = Total number of books - Number of books given away

We are also given that Pol sold some books at a garage sale, so let's call the number of books sold x. Using this information, we can set up another equation:

Total number of books - Number of books given away = Number of books sold + Number of books remaining

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you use these equations to find out how many books Pol sold at the garage sale?"
Response:  We know that Pol had initially 153 books and 95 pennies. After selling some of his belongings at a garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 oakleys. So, to find out how many books Pol sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had:  Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books after the sale  Number of books sold = 153 - 13  = 140 books  Therefore, Pol sold 140 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Pavle had initially 42 olive branches and 143 books. After selling some of his belongings at a garage sale, he was left with 113 books and 19 olive branches. To find out how many olive branches Pavle sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of olive branches he had after the sale from the initial amount: 19 - 14 = 5. So, Pavle sold 5 olive branches at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, there were 10 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica took 8 more roses from her garden and put them in the vase. So, now there are 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  At the beginning, Jessica had 16 roses in her vase. Then she added another 16 roses to it, so now there are 32 roses in total (16 + 16 = 32). Therefore, the number of roses in the vase at the beginning was 16.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially two roses in the vase and Jessica added four more roses from her garden to make it five roses total. Then she cut some new roses from her garden to add to the vase, making the total number of roses nine (5 + 4). Finally, she put even more new roses into the vase, bringing the total number up to twenty-three (9 + x), where x is the number of additional roses she placed in the vase. So, the correct answer is 23.
Response:  First, there were 15 roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica threw away 33 roses and added new ones to the vase, so now there are 17 roses in total. To find out how many more roses she picked than threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away from the original number of roses: 33 - 15 = 18 So, Jessica picked 18 more roses than she threw away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 21 roses in the vase and then Jessica added 34 more roses from her garden to make it total of 55 roses (including the original ones). Now, she took some new roses out of her garden and put them into the vase, making the current number of roses in the vase is 15. So, the difference between the number of roses Jessica added and the number she took away is 49 (55 - 15 = 49). Therefore, Jessica bailed 49 more roses than she cut from her garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 7 roses in the vase and then Jessica removed some more roses from her bouquet which had 59 roses in total. So, if she removed x roses, then the number of roses left in her bouquet is 59 - x. Now, we are told that after removing these roses, Jessica has 20 roses in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses she removed from her bouquet is equal to 20 - (59 - x) = x. So, the answer is x = 13.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 13 roses in the vase and then Jessica removed some more roses from her garden to add to the vase, leaving it with 12 roses. Now, if there are 21 roses in the vase, that means that Jessica added 9 more roses (21 - 12 = 9). So, the number of roses left in the garden is 12 + 9 = 21. Therefore, there are 21 roses left in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some more roses and orchids from her own flower garden. So, she added 15 + x = 96 (where x is the number of orchids she picked) to the initial total. Now, we have 30 roses (15 original + 15 picked) and 96 orchids (62 original + 34 picked). Therefore, Jessica picked 34 orchids.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. However, she did not pick any orchids from her garden. So, after adding the new roses, the total number of roses in the vase is now 10 (initial + additional). As for the orchids, they remained at 2. Therefore, the final count of orchids in the vase is 21 ( initial + additional). Hence, Jessica has isected 9 orchids (21 - 12 = 9).
Response:  Firstly, there were 5 ruža and 3 orhideja in the vase initially. Then, Џекица (Jessica) picked some more roses and orchids from her garden. So, now she has 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Therefore, there are more roses than orchids in the vase currently. The number of roses is 12, while the number of orchids is 2.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 7 ruža and 12 orhideja in the vase. Then, Џeшиka added more roses and orchids from her own collection. So, now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers: 20 - 11 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  We know that Jessica has removed roses from her vase and now there are 19 roses in it. If there were initially three roses in the vase, then how many times did she remove them? To find out, we can divide the number of roses in the vase after removal (19) by the initial number of roses (3): 19 / 3 = 6 Therefore, Jessica removed the roses six times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some more flowers from her own garden and added them to the vase. So, now there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica picked, we can subtract the number of roses she already had (14) from the total number of roses in the vase after she added hers (91). Therefore, Jessica picked 77 roses (91 - 14 = 77).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some more flowers from her own garden and added them to the vase. We are told that she picked ""some"" more roses and orchids, but we don't know exactly how many. So let's assume that she picked an equal number of each type of flower (i.e., 1/2 rose, 1/2 orchid). Therefore, after adding these new flowers to the vase, there would be:  Number of roses before = 16 + (1/2 x 16) = 19 roses Number of orchids before = 3 + (1/2 x 3) = 4 orchids Now, we are told that Jessica has 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So, we can deduce that she must have isected 4 - 7 = 3 orchids and 13 - 19 = 4 roses. Therefore, Jessica isced 3 orchids and 4 roses from the vase."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 6 ruža and 20 orhideja in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, so now she has 21 orhideje and 22 ruže uva. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses: 22 - 20 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more roses than orchids in the vase.
Response:  Firstly, there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase initially. Then, Jessica picked some more roses and orchids from her own flowers. So, now there are 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. Therefore, there are more orchids than roses in the vase now. The difference between the number of orchids and roses is 10 (13 - 3). Hence, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  Robin had long hair that was 17 inches long. He then cut it short by several inches. If his new length is 13 inches shorter than before, we can calculate how much he cut off using the difference between their lengths. So, if Robin cut off 4 inches of his hair (17 - 13 = 4), then he ostensibly shaved off half of his original length.
Response:  We know that Robin has cut her hair by 20 inches and now it is 10 inches long. So, if we subtract the length of her hair before she cut it (which was 20 inches) from the current length of her hair (which is 10 inches), we get: $ \text{Length of Robin's hair before cutting} - \text{Current length of Robin's hair} = 20 - 10 = 10 \text{ inches} $ Therefore, Robin's hair was 10 inches longer before she cut it.
Response:  Firstly, Robin had hair that was 16 inches long (15 cm). Then it grew another 12 inches (30 cm), so now his hair is 28 inches (71 cm) long.
Response:  Robin had hair that was 30 centimeters long (or 30 cm). If it grew another 18 inches, which is equal to 45.72 centimeters, then his hair would be: 30 + 45 = 75 centimeters long.
Response:  Robin has cut her hair to 13 inches long. Initially, it was 14 inches long. So, if she had cut off 1 inch of hair, then now her hair is 13 inches long.
Response:  Robin had long hair that was 14 inches (35 cm) long and then grew another 8 inches (20 cm). So, his total length of hair is now 22 inches (56 cm).
Response:  Deni has 12 caps in his collection. If he found 53 caps in the park, then he now has a total of 65 caps (12 + 53).
Response:  Deni has 21 caps for bottles in his collection. He found some more caps for bottles in the park. If he found 53 caps of bottle caps in total, then he must have found 32 caps (53 - 21) in addition to the 21 he already had. Therefore, Deni now has 53 caps for bottles in his collection.
Response:  Deni collected 63 caps for bottles in the park while throwing away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 caps in his collection. So, initially, Deni had 63 - 51 = 12 caps.
Response:  Deni collected 36 caps for bottles in the park while he threw away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 caps in his collection. So, the number of caps Dan found in the park is equal to the number of caps he threw away minus the number of caps he already had in his collection. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of caps Dan found = 35 - 22 = 13.
Response:  We know that Deni collected 30 caps for bottles in the park while he threw away 63 old ones. Now he has 42 caps in his collection. So, how many more caps did Dan throw aside besides the ones he found in the park?  To find this out, we need to subtract the number of caps he found from the total number of caps he threw away:  Number of caps thrown aside = Total number of caps thrown away - Number of caps found = 63 - 30 = 33 Therefore, Dan threw aside 33 additional caps beside the ones he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Deni collected 22 caps and packages in the park initially. Then he found more - 8 packages and 28 caps. So, at first, Deni had 22 + 8 = 30 items in his collection. Therefore, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  At first, Dan had 22 caps and 30 packages in the park. Now he has 17 caps and 57 packages in his collection. So, initially, Dan had 22 + 30 = 52 packages.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 30 caps and 14 packages in the park. Now he has 7 caps for bottles and 86 packages in his collection. So, we can write an equation: Number of caps = 7 Number of packages = 86 - 14 + 30 To solve this equation, we need to subtract 14 from both sides: Number of caps = 7 Number of packages = 86 - 14 = 72 Therefore, there are more packages than caps. The difference between the number of packages and caps is 72.
"Response:  We know that Dan collected 11 caps and 28 packages in the park. Now he has 68 caps and 51 packages in his collection. To find out how many more packages than caps Dan found in the park, we can subtract the number of packages he already had from the total number of packages he found:

Number of packages Dan found in the park = Total number of packages he found - Number of packages he already had
= 28 - 11
= 17

So, Dan found 17 more packages than caps in the park."
Response:  At first, Deni had 71 caps for bottles and 24 packages in the park. Then he collected 28 more caps for bottles and 16 more packages. So, initially, Deni had 71 + 28 = 99 caps for bottles and 24 + 16 = 40 packages. Now, Deni has 28 fewer caps for bottles than he had at first (99 - 28 = 71), and he has 16 fewer packages than he had at first (40 - 16 = 24). Therefore, the difference between the number of caps for bottles that Deni had at first and the number he has now is 71 - 28 = 43, and the difference between the number of packages he had at first and the number he has now is 40 - 16 = 24.
Response:  We know that Dan has collected 27 caps and 43 packages in his collection.  He had 10 caps and 62 packages in the park initially. So, he gained 17 caps (27 - 10) and 31 packages (43 - 62). Therefore, Dan now has 31 more packages than caps. In other words, for every cap he has, he has 31 packages more. So, if he has x caps, he has 31x packages.
Response:  We know that Deni lost 66 caps in the park and now has 25 caps for bottles in his collection. So, he had more caps than he currently has. To find out how many caps Dan had at first, we can subtract the number of caps he lost from the number of caps he has now:  Number of caps Dan had at first = Number of caps he has now - Number of caps he lost  In this case, the number of caps he has now is 25, and the number of caps he lost is 66, so:  Number of caps Dan had at first = 25 - 66 = -41  Therefore, Dan had 41 caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Dan had 25 capsules in his collection before he found some more in the park. If he found x additional capsules in the park, then he now has a total of 25 + x capsules. Since he already had 32 capsules in his collection, we can set up the equation: 25 + x = 32. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So, Dan found 7 additional capsules in the park.
Response:  Deni collected 60 old caps in the park and found 58 new ones. So he has 60 + 58 = 118 caps now. Since he had 67 caps at the end, we can deduce that he started with 67 - 118 = -51 caps. However, this is impossible since he cannot have negative caps. Therefore, the correct answer is 60.
Response:  Deni collected 6 old caps in the park and found 50 new caps for bottles. Now he has 60 caps for bottles in his collection. So, the number of caps Danilo found in the park is equal to the number of caps he threw away minus the number of new caps he found: 6 - 50 = -44. Therefore, Danilo found -44 caps in the park.
Response:  Deni collected 48 new caps for bottles and threw away 54 old ones in the park. Now he has 52 caps for bottles in his collection. So, he threw away more than he found. Therefore, the number of caps Deni threw away is equal to the difference between the total number of caps he found (48) and the number of caps he already had (52):  Number of caps thrown away = Total number of caps found - Number of caps already had = 48 - 52 = -4 The negative sign indicates that Deni threw away more caps than he found.
Response:  We know that Deni collected 82 packages and 29 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 packaging in his collection. So, initially, Deni had 82 - 42 = 40 bottle caps.
Response:  At first, Deni had 66 packages and 39 bottles in the park. Now he has 16 bottles and 68 packages in his collection. So, initially, Deni had 66 + 39 = 105 package
Response:  We know that Dan collected 21 caps for bottles and 52 packages in his collection.  We also know that he found 46 packaging and 50 cap for bottles in the park. So, we can write an equation: Number of caps for bottles = Total number of packages - Number of packages found in the park.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of caps for bottles = 50 - 46 = 4. Therefore, Dan found 4 more caps for bottles than packages in the park.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 31 caps and 9 packages in his collection after finding 65 packages and 5 cap boxes in the park. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = 65 + 5 = 70 Number of caps = 31 + 9 = 40 Now, we need to find out how many more packages than caps Dan found in the park. To do this, we subtract the number of caps from the number of packages: More packages = 70 - 40 = 30 Therefore, Dan found 30 more packages than caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Deni had 58 caps and 25 packages in the park. Now he has 11 packages and 12 caps for bottles in his collection. So, initially, Deni had more caps than packages (58 - 25 = 33). After collecting new items, he now has more packages than caps (11 + 12 = 23). Therefore, the difference between the number of packages and caps that Deni had before and after collecting new items is: 23 - 33 = -10. So, Deni had fewer packages than caps before collecting new items.
Response:  We know that Dan has 67 packages and 35 caps in his collection.  He found 15 caps and 18 packaging in the park. So he had 67 + 15 = 82 packages before finding any packaging. And he found 18 packaging. Therefore, he now has 82 + 18 = 100 packages in his collection.  So, there are more packages than caps in Dan's collection.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer prawns than Steve. So if Jake had 17 prawns, Steve would have 28 prawns (17 - 11 = 28). Therefore, Steve has 28 prawns.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer prawns than Steve. So, Jake has x prawns less than Steve. Secondly, we know that Steve has more than 14 prawns and Sally has 15 prawns. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Steve + Sally = Jake (prawns)

Now let's solve for Jake's number of prawns using substitution method. We are given that Steve has 15 prawns more than Sally, so:

Steve = Sally + 15

Substituting this into our original equation, we get:

Jake = Sally + 15 - x

Now we have to find out what is x. From the question, we know that Jake has 7 prawns less than Steve, so:

x = 7

Therefore, Jake has 7 prawns less than Steve, which means he has 7 - 7 = 0 prawns. So, Jake has no prawns."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer prawns than Steve, so Jake has 18 - X prawns where X is the number of prawns Steve has. Secondly, we know that Steve has more prawns than Jackie, so Steve has 19 + Y prawns where Y is the number of prawns Jackie has. Now, we can set up an equation based on these two statements: 18 - X = 19 + Y (1) Substituting X = 13 (since Steve has 13 more prawns than Jake), we get: 18 - 13 = 19 + Y (2) Solving for Y, we get: Y = 6 (since 19 + 6 = 25, which is the total number of prawns Steve and Jackie have). Therefore, Jackie has 6 prawns.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer prawns than Steve. So, Jake has x prawns less than Steve. Secondly, we know that Steve has 8 more prawns than Jackie. Therefore, Steve has (x + 8) prawns in total. Finally, we are told that Steve has 5 more prawns than Jill. So, Jill has (x + 8) - 5 prawns in total. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information: x + 8 = (x + 8) - 5 Subtracting (x + 8) from both sides gives us: x = 3 Since Jake has 3 fewer prawns than Steve, and Steve has 8 more prawns than Jill, we can conclude that Jake has 5 more prawns than Jill.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer prawns than Steve, so Jake has x prawns less than Steve. Secondly, we know that Steve has more prawns than Jackie, so Steve has y prawns more than Jackie. Finally, we are told that Steve has 11 more prawns than Jackie, which means that Steve has y = 11 prawns more than Jackie. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:  Number of prawns = x - y (Jake) + y (Steve) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of prawns = 12 - 4 + 11 = 27 So, Jackie has 27 prawns more than Jake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 prawns less than Steve and 9 more than Jill. So, if Steve has 16 prawns, then Jill has 16 + 9 = 25 prawns. Therefore, Jack has 25 - 7 = 18 prawns.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 prawns less than Steve and 8 more than Jill. So, if Steve has 17 prawns, then Jill has 17 + 8 = 25 prawns. Therefore, Jill has 25 prawns.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 prawns less than Steve and 18 more than Jill. So, if Steve has x prawns, then Jill has x + 18 prawns. Since Steve has 16 prawns, we can set up an equation as follows:
x = 16 - 9
x = 7
Therefore, Steve has 7 more prawns than Jill."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer prawns than Steve and Steve has more prawns than Jackie. So, if we subtract the number of prawns that Steve has from the total number of prawns that Jake has, we will get the number of prawns that Jackie has. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of prawns that Jackie has = Total number of prawns that Jake has - Number of prawns that Steve has  In this case, the total number of prawns that Jake has is 6 less than the number of prawns that Steve has, so we can write:  Number of prawns that Jackie has = 6 - x Where x is the number of prawns that Steve has. Since Steve has 18 more prawns than Jake, we can substitute the value of x in for 18:  Number of prawns that Jackie has = 6 - 18 = -12 Therefore, Jackie has -12 prawns.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 5 fewer sprinkles than Steve. So, if Steve has x sprinkles, then Jake has x - 5 = 9 sprinkles.  Next, we are told that Steve has 18 more sprinkles than Jill. Therefore, if Jill has y sprinkles, then Steve has y + 18 = 27 sprinkles. Finally, we are asked how many more sprinkles Jack has than Jill. Since Jill has 87 sprinkles and Jack has 9 sprinkles, we can say that Jack has 87 - 9 = 78 more sprinkles than Jill.  So, the answer is 78.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer prawns than Steve - 16 less to be exact. So, Steve has more prawns than Jake. Secondly, we are told that Steven has 15 more prawns than Jill. Therefore, if Jill has x prawns, then Steven has x + 15 prawns. Now, we are asked how many more prawns Jill has than Jake. We can use the information given in the question to find this out. Since Jill has x prawns and Jake has 16 fewer prawns than Jill, Jake has x - 16 prawns. Therefore, the difference between the number of prawns Jill has and the number of prawns Jake has is 16. So, Jill has 16 more prawns than Jake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that STEVEN has 19 prackers and 14 jabkas. So, if Jake has less than Steven, then he must have 19 - x prackers where x is the number of prackers Jake has. Similarly, if Jake has more than Steven in jabkas, then he must have x + 14 jabkas where x is the number of jabkas Jake has. Now, we are given that Jake has 12 fewer prickers than Steve. Therefore, we can write: 19 - x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So, Jake has 7 prackers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer apricots than Steve because he has 13 less apricots than Steve. So, if Steve has x apricots, then Jake has x - 13 apricots.  Next, we know that Jake has more apples than Steve because he has 3 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x + 3 apples.  Now, we can set up an equation based on these two statements: Jake has x - 13 apricots and x + 3 apples.  Solving for x (the number of apricots), we get: x = 7. Therefore, Jake has 7 apricots.  As for the number of apples, since Jake has 3 more apples than Steve, Jake has x + 3 = 8 apples.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 less plums than apples for Jack and STEVEN has 17 more plums than JACK. So, if JACK has x pra...
Question: What is the value of x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20?
Answer: To solve this equation, subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then, divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 5. Therefore, the value of x is 5."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has fewer plums than Steve. So, if Jack has x plums and Steve has y plums, then x is less than y.  Secondly, we know that Steve has more apples than Jack. So, if Steve has y apples and Jack has x apples, then y is greater than x. Now, let's find out how many more apples Steve has than Jack:  Number of apples Steve has = y - x  Since x is less than y, we can say that y - x represents the number of apples that Steve has more than Jack. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Steve has and the number of apples Jack has is:  Difference in number of apples = y - x  Now, we are given that Steve has 12 plums and Jack has 3 plums less than Steve. So, the total number of plums that Jack has is:  Total number of plums Jack has = 12 (Steve) - 3 (less than Steve)  Substituting this value into the equation for the difference in number of apples, we get:  Difference in number of apples = 12 - 3 = 9  Therefore, Steve has 9 more apples than Jack.
"Response:  According to the problem, Steve has 12 prawns and Jack has 4 fewer than Steve who has 67 more than Jill. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:
Steve has 12 prawns (S) = 12
Jack has 4 fewer prawns than Steve (J) = S - 4
Steve has 67 more prawns than Jill (S - J) = 67
Now, let's solve for Jack's number of prawns:
J = S - 4
Substituting the values given in the problem:
J = 12 - 4
J = 8
So, Jack has 8 prawns."
Response:  According to the question, STEVEN has 18 prawns and JAKE has 12 fewer than STEVEN who has 8 more than JILL. So, we can write an equation as follows:  STEVEN = 18 JAKE - 12 + 8JILL  Now, let's solve for JILL'S number of prawns:  Substituting the values given in the question into the above equation, we get: 18 = 12 + 8JILL  Solving for JILL'S number of prawns, we get:  JILL = 6  Therefore, Jill has 6 prawns.
Response:  According to the question, Стивен has 19 prawns and Яке has 72 more than Џил. So, if we add the number of prawns that Яке has to the number of prawns that Стивен has, we get: 19 + (72 - Џил) =....  Can you fill in the blank with the correct value for Џил?
Response:  Стивен has 14 prawns and Яке has 6 fewer than Стивен, so Яке has 14 - 6 = 8 prawns. Now, Џил has 3 more than Яке, so Џил has 8 + 3 = 11 prawns. Therefore, Џил has 11 prawns.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has more than 84 jabokes and less than 10 prawns than Steve. So, if Steve has x prawns, then Jack has x + 84 jabokes. Secondly, we know that Steve has 13 prawns, so he must have 13 - x prawns left after giving some to Jack. Thirdly, we are told that Jack has 52 jabokes, which means that he has 52 - (x + 84) jabokes in total. Finally, since Jack has fewer prawns than Steve, Jack must have fewer than 10 prawns. Therefore, the number of prawns that Jack has is less than or equal to 10. Since Jack cannot have exactly 10 prawns, the minimum possible value of x is 11. Hence, Џeјk has at least 11 prawns.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has more jabucks than Steve. So, Jake has 13 - 17 = -4 jabucks less than Steve. Now, we need to find out how many jabucks Steve has. We are told that Steve has 8 prackies and 12 jabucks. Therefore, Steve has 8 + 12 = 20 jabucks in total. Finally, since Jake has -4 fewer jabucks than Steve, Jake must have 20 - 4 = 16 jabucks. So, Jake has 16 jabucks.
Response:  According to the question, STEVEN has 11 jabucks and 18 prawns.  If he had 8 fewer prawns than jacks, then he would have 18 - 8 = 10 prawns less than Jack.  So, Steve has 10 more prawns than jack.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 fewer plums than apples in Steve's bag. So, if Steve has x apples and y plums, then he has 3x - 3y jabuks. Secondly, we know that STEVEN HAS 19 JABUKA AND 15 PRUMSIC. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 3x - 3y = 19 + 15. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 27 and y = -6. So, Steven has 27 more apples than plums.
Response:  We know that Olivia had $78 in her wallet initially.  She spent $15 at the supermarket. So, we can write an equation: $78 - $15 = X, where X is the amount of money Olivia has left. Solving for X, we get: $63. Therefore, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet.
Response:  If Oliva spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $100 to start with, then she has $22 left ($100 - $78 = $22).
Response:  At first, Olivia had $100 in her wallet. Then she took out $148 from the bank, so now she has $248 ($100 + $148). After shopping at the supermarket, she spent $159, leaving her with $93 ($248 - $159). Therefore, Olivia spent $93.
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her wallet to start with. She took out another $49 from the bank, so now she has $52 ($3 + $49). 
She spent $52 at the supermarket. So, after shopping, she has $49 left ($52 - $52 = $0).  Therefore, Olivia collected more money from the bank than she spent at the supermarket, so the difference is $49 ($52 - $49 = $49)."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Olivia had $53 in her wallet initially. Then she collected an additional $91 from the bank, so now she has a total of $144 ($53 + $91).  Next, after visiting the supermarket, she spent $14 there, leaving her with $130 ($144 - $14). Therefore, Olivia spent more money at the supermarket than she collected from the bank ($91 - $14 = $77)."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her wallet and after visiting both the supermarket and the art gallery, she was left with $70 ($106 - $39 = $70). So, she spent $49 at the art gallery.
Response:  After Olivia visited the supermarket and spent $29, she had $54 left in her wallet. So, she spent $29 / $54 = $\frac{29}{54}$ of her money.
"Response:  We know that Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet to start with. So, we can write an equation:

$128 - $38 = x

Where x is the amount of money Olivia has left after buying groceries. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $38 from both sides of the equation:

$90 = x

So, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after buying groceries."
Response:  Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them. So, the number of applications left on his phone is: 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 applications remaining on Dave's phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 23 applications on his phone (20 - 18 = 3). After he deleted 18 of them, he was left with 5 applications. So, initially, Dave had 3 applications on his phone.
Response:  Dave had 10 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 11 new applications, so now he has 21 applications (10 + 11 = 21). After deleting some of them, he was left with 4 applications. Therefore, Dave deleted 17 applications (21 - 4 = 17).
Response:  Dave had 21 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 89 new applications, so now he has a total of 21 + 89 = 106 applications on his phone. Later, he deleted some of them, leaving him with 24 applications remaining. Therefore, the addition made by Dave is equal to the number of applications he added minus the number he deleted, which is 106 - 24 = 82 applications.
Response:  Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 71 new applications, so the total number of applications became 86 (15 + 71). After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. So, the number of applications that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number and the final number, which is:  14 - 15 = -1 application. Therefore, Dave deleted 1 application.
Response:  Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone before he deleted some apps and files. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, he must have deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  Dave had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone before he deleted some apps and files. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 3 applications and 7 files. So, he must have deleted 14 apps (17 - 3 = 14) and 14 files (21 - 7 = 14). Therefore, he deleted 14 apps and 14 files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially.  After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, to find out how many more applications than files he has, we can subtract the number of files from the total number of applications: 21 - 4 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 more applications than files remaining on Dave's phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 6 apps and 15 files. To find out how many more files than apps are left on his phone, we can divide the number of remaining files (15) by the number of remaining apps (6):  Therefore, there are 2.5 times as many files as apps left on Dave's phone after he deleted some of them.
Response:  Dave had 17 applications on his phone and after adding something else, he has 18 applications left. So, the number of applications that Dave added is 18 - 17 = 1. Therefore, the answer is 1 application.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 59 files on his phone before he deleted some apps and data. After deleting some apps and data, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. To find out how many applications Dave deleted, we can divide the number of remaining applications (12) by the initial number of applications (15): 12 / 15 = 0.8. So, Dave deleted 7 applications.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone before he deleted some apps and data. After deleting some apps and data, he was left with 17 applications and 21 files. To find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting apps and data from the total number of files he had initially. So, the answer is: Number of files deleted = Total number of files - Number of files after deleting apps and data = 24 - 17 = 7 files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone before he deleted some apps and files. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. To find out how many more applications than files he has, we need to subtract the number of files from the number of applications:  Number of applications - Number of files = 12 - 5 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 more applications than files remaining on Dave's phone after deleting some apps and files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone before he deleted some apps and files. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 24 folders and 2 applications. So, we can say that: Number of folders = 24 Number of applications = 2 Now, let's find out how many more folders than applications are remaining on the phone: Number of folders - Number of applications = 24 - 2 = 22 Therefore, there are 22 more folders than applications remaining on Dave's phone.
"Response:  Nel has 242 baseball cards and gives 136 of them to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nel is:

242 - 136 = 106

Therefore, there are 106 baseball cards remaining in Nel's collection."
Response:  Nel has given 301 of her baseball cards to Jeff and now she has 154 left. So, initially, Nel had 301 + 154 = 455 baseball cards. Therefore, Nel had 455 baseball cards in the beginning.
Response:  Nel has 528 cards and Jeff has 11 cards initially.  If Nel gives some of her cards to Jeff, then the number of cards she has left is 528 - 11 = 517.  Since Jeff now has 11 + 25 = 36 more cards than he had initially, the total number of cards that Nel gave him is 36. Therefore, the number of cards Nel gave Jeff is 36 / 11 = 3.27 (round down to nearest integer). So, Nel gave Jeff 3 cards.
Response:  Nel has initially 566 baseball cards and gives some to Jeff. After that, she has 535 cards left. So, Jeff had 234 cards before he got any from Nel. Now, he has 234 + (535 - 566) = 709 cards. Therefore, Jeff now has 709 cards.
Response:  Nel had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 415 baseball cards. So, she gained 76 baseball cards (415 - 309 = 76). Since she also had 356 non-baseball cards, she now has 149 + 356 = 505 non-baseball cards in total. Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nel has more than 10 is 76 - 10 = 66.
Response:  We know that Nel had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she now has 404 - 246 = 158 baseball cards left.  Moreover, we know that she had 214 ten-card packs and gave some to Jeff as well. Therefore, she now has 495 - 214 = 281 ten-card packs remaining.  Now, let's calculate how many more ten-card packs than baseball cards Nel has:  Number of ten-card packs = 281  Number of baseball cards = 158  Ratio of ten-card packs to baseball cards = 281 / 158 = 1.73  So, Nel has approximately 1.73 times more ten-card packs than baseball cards.
Response:  Nel has 573 baseball cards and gives 195 to John and Jeff together. So, she has 378 card left (573 - 195 = 378). Now, we are told that Nel gave some of her remaining cards to Jeff. This means that after giving cards to Jeff, Nel has fewer cards than before. Therefore, the number of cards Nel gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between the total number of cards she had initially and the number of cards she has left now.  Using this logic, we can calculate the number of cards Nel gave to Jeff as follows: Number of cards Nel gave to Jeff = Total number of cards Initially - Number of cards Left after giving some to Jeff Total number of cards Initially = 573 Card given to John and Jeff = 195 Number of cards Left after giving some to Jeff = 378 Therefore, the number of cards Nel gave to Jeff is: Number of cards Nel gave to Jeff = 573 - 378 = 195  So, Nel gave 195 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Nel had 438 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 55 remaining baseball cards and 178 left with her. So, the total number of baseball cards that Nel has is :  Number of baseball cards = Total number of baseball cards given + Total number of baseball cards left with her  Number of baseball cards = 438 + 178 = 616 Therefore, Nel has 616 baseball cards in addition to the 10 cards she gave to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nel had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, after giving them away, she has 376 ten-card packs and 111 baseball cards left. Now, we need to find out how many more ten-card packs than baseball cards Neal has. To do this, we can divide the number of ten-card packs by the number of baseball cards: Number of ten-card packs = 376 / 111 = 3.39 (round down to 3) Therefore, Neel has 3 more ten-card packs than baseball cards.
Response:  Paco had 44 cola...
Response:  Paco had 28 cookies and he ate some of them. We don't know how many he ate, but let's assume it was x. Now, we are told that after eating some, he has 7 cookies left. So, if x is the number of cookies Paco ate, then the total number of cookies Paco had = 28 - x. Since there are 7 cookies left, we can set up the equation: 28 - x = 7. Solving for x, we get: x = 21. Therefore, Paco ate 21 cookies.
Response:  Paco initially had 40 cookies and ate two of them. So he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Then, he bought another 37 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Paco now has is 38 + 37 = 75 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 25 cookies initially and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 cookies left. Then, he bought 3 more cookies. Now, he has 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Therefore, he ate more cookies than he bought. The difference between the number of cookies he had after eating and the number of cookies he bought is 23 - 3 = 20 cookies.
"Response:  Paco had 13 cola...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Paco had 13 cola cakes and he ate two of them. Then, he bought 36 more cola cakes. So, the total number of cola cakes Paco has is:

13 - 2 = 11 (colas he had before eating any) + 36 (colas he bought later) = 47

Therefore, Paco bought more cola cakes than he ate."
Response:  Paco has eaten 40 cookies and given 13 to his friends. So, he has 40 - 13 = 27 cookies left.
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 cookies and gave 13 to his friend. So, he has 17 - 13 = 4 more cookies than what he gave away. Therefore, Paco has 4 more cookies than his friend.
Response:  Paco has eaten 12 cookies and given 21 to his friends. So he has 21 - 12 = 9 more cookies than he gave away. Therefore, he gave 9 / 3 = 3 cookies to each of his 3 friends.
Response:  Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salty cookies. So, how many cookies are left for Paco? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had. We can do this as follows: Number of cookies remaining = Total number of cookies - Number of cookies eaten Total number of cookies = 22 + 75 = 97 Number of cookies eaten = 15 + 54 = 69 Therefore, there are 97 - 69 = 28 cookies left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty ones, so he ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salted ones. So, the number of unsalted cookies left with Paco is:  Number of unsalted cookies = Total number of unsalted cookies - Number of unsalted cookies eaten by Paco = 6 - 3 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 unsalted cookies remaining with Paco.
Response:  Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty ones. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty ones. So, he has 37 - 5 = 32 sweet cookies left. Now, we need to find out how many more sweet cookies Paco ate than salty ones. We can do this by subtracting the number of salty cookies he ate from the total number of sweet cookies he had: 32 (sweet cookies) - 2 (salty cookies) = 30 More sweet cookies were eaten than salty ones. Therefore, Paco ate 30 more s
Response:  Paco had 8 sweet cookies and ate 20 of them. So he has 8 - 20 = 12 sweet cookies left. He also had 6 salty cookies and ate 34 of them. So he has 6 - 34 = -28 salty cookies left (since negative numbers indicate the amount he ate). Therefore, Paco ate more salty cookies than sweet ones. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate is 34 - 12 = 22.
Response:  If Paco had 36 cookies at first and he ate 1 cookie, then he has 35 cookies left. So, if he ate another cookie, he would have 34 cookies left, and so on... Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco has left is: 36 - 1 = 35 - x, where x is the number of cookies he eats. Since he eats one cookie in each round, we can write: 35 - (x-1) = 0. Solving for x, we get: x = 36. So, Paco has 36 cookies left after eating all the cookies.
Response:  Paco had 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Then, he ate 10 of them, so he has 22 - 10 = 12 cookies left. Therefore, there are 12 cookies remaining for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then, he ate 18 of them. So, the number of cookies he ate is 18. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies he ate and the number he gave away is 18 - 9 = 9.
"Response:  Paco had 6 cola...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Paco had 6 colaçići and gave 30 to his friend. So, he has 6 - 30 = 24 left. Then, he ate 23 of them. That means he has 24 - 23 = 1 colaçić left. Therefore, he gave his friend more colaçići than he ate."
Response:  Paco had 97 sweet rolls and 34 sweets in total. He ate 15 sweet rolls and 56 sweets. So, how many sweet rolls are left for Paco? We can calculate this as follows: Number of sweet rolls Paco has = Total number of sweet rolls - Number of sweet rolls eaten = 97 - 15 = 82 Therefore, there are 82 sweet rolls left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 26 sweet rolls and 17 sweet rolls, so he has a total of 43 sweet rolls. Then, Jack ate 14 sweet rolls and 9 sweet rolls, leaving Paco with 28 sweet rolls. Therefore, there are 28 sweet rolls left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty ones. He ate 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet ones. So, he ate more sweet cookies than salty ones. The difference between the number of sweet cookies he had and the number of sweet cookies he ate is equal to the number of salty cookies he ate minus the number of salty cookies he had. Therefore, the difference in numbers is: 39 - 23 = 16. So, Paco ate 16 more sweet cookies than salty ones.
Response:  Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 salty cookies. So, he ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the total number of salty cookies he had is equal to the difference between the number of sweet cookies he had and the total number of sweet cookies he ate. Therefore, the number of salty cookies Paco ate is 37 (28 + 9).
Response:  We know that Gvena received $7 for her birthday and spent some money. So she had $5 left after spending something. Therefore, we can conclude that she spent half of the amount she received ($7) which is $3.50. Thus, Gvena spent $3.50.
Response:  Gwen received $X dollars for her birthday and spent $8 of it. So she has $X - $8 = $6 left. Since she spent $8, we know that $X - $8 = $6 is true. Now, we can solve for X using basic arithmetic: $$ X = 6 \div 2 = 3 $$ Therefore, Gwen received $3 dollars for her birthday.
Response:  First, Gvena received $2 from her mother for her birthday. Then, her father gave her an additional $4. So, she had a total of $6 ($2 + $4). If she spent $3, then she still has $3 left ($6 - $3 = $3). Therefore, Gvena still has $3 in addition to what she already had from her parents.
Response:  Gvenin received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. She spent $4. So, she has $8 + $5 - $4 = $9 more dollars from her mother than from her father.
Response:  First, Gvena received $3 from her mother for her birthday. Then, she received $6 from her father. If she spent $4, that means she has $10 left ($3 + $6 - $4). So, Gvena received more money from her father than from her mother. The difference is $6 - $3 = $3. Therefore, Gvena received $3 more from her father than from her mother.
Response:  First, Gvena received $5 from her father for her birthday. Then, her mother gave her an additional $7. So, in total, Gvena received $5 + $7 = $12 from her parents. Next, it says that she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money Gvena received from her mother minus the amount she spent is equal to the difference between the amounts she received from her father and mother. That is, ($12 - $4) = ($9). So, Gvena received $9 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Gvenin received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she has a total of $7 ($5 + $2). If she spent $6, then she has $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, Gvenin received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  Josh had 9 marbles in his collection and lost some marbles. If he has 4 marbles left now, that means he lost x marbles. So, we can write an equation: 9 - x = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. Therefore, Josh lost 5 marbles.
Response:  We know that Josh had some marbles in his collection and lost 21 of them. So, he has fewer marbles now than he did before. Let's assume that he had x marbles initially. Then, after losing 21 marbles, he has x - 21 marbles left. Since we are told that he has 12 marble now, we can set up the equation: x - 21 = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 33. Therefore, Josh had 33 marbles in his collection initially.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 19 cufflinks in his collection and lost 11 of them. So he has 8 remaining (19 - 11 = 8). Then, he found 5 new cufflinks. Therefore, his current number of cufflinks is 8 + 5 = 13. So, Josh now has 13 cufflinks in his collection.
Response: Џosh had 4 cups in his collection and lost 16 cups. So he has 4 - 16 = -12 cups left. Then, he found 8 new cups. So, he gained 8 + 12 = 20 cups. Therefore, he lost more cups than he found, so the answer is negative 20.
Response:  Josh had 7 cups in his collection and lost 8 of them, so he has 7 - 8 = 9 remaining cups. Then, he found 10 new cups, which means he gained 10 - 9 = 1 more cup than he lost. Therefore, the final number of cups Josh has is 9 + 1 = 10.
Response: Џosh had 21 cuffles in his collection and then he found 7 more. So, now he has 21 + 7 = 28 marbles.
Response: Џosh had 20 cups in his collection and gave two to Jack. So now he has 20 - 2 = 18 cups left.
Response: Џosh had 22 cups in his collection and Jack gave him 20 more. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 cups.
Response:  We know that Josh had 19 cufflinks initially and lost 11 of them. So, he now has 8 (19 - 11) cufflinks left in his collection.
Response: Џosh had 22 cups in his collection and found 13 marbles. So he has 9 marbles left (22 - 13 = 9). Then, he lost 5 marbles, so he has 4 marbles left (9 - 5 = 4). Therefore, Josh now has 4 marbles in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 15 cufflinks in his collection and found 9 more. So he now has 15 + 9 = 24 cufflinks in total. He lost 23 cufflinks, so he is left with 24 - 23 = 1 cufflink. Therefore, Josh lost one cufflink.
Response: Џosh had three marbles in his collection and found six rubber bands. So he gained three marbles (three - three = zero). He lost five marbles, so he has five fewer marbles than before (zero - five = negative five). Therefore, Josh found three more marbles than he lost (-five + three = positive two).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 4 kg of jams.  Since Marco's jam weighs 19 kg more than his father's, then his father's jam must have weighed (4 kg) + (19 kg) = 23 kg. Therefore, Marco's jam weighed 23 kg - 4 kg = 19 kg more than his father's jam.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 35 kg of berries.  Since Marco's berries weigh 13 kg less than his father's, then his father's berries weigh 22 kg (35 - 13 = 22). Therefore, his father's berries are heavier than Marco's by 22 kg.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 20 kg of jam. His father had 17 kg of jam. So, if they collected together, then Marco's jam must be equal to 20 - 17 = 3 kg. Therefore, Marcos jams weigh 3 kg.
Response:  Marco and his father together have collected 16 kg of berries (8 kg + 32 kg). Therefore, their combined weight of berries is 16 kg.
Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 24 kg of berries, then Marco had 3 kg of them after he lost some. So, his father must have had 21 kg of berries (24 - 3 = 21).
"Response: 
Marc and his father together collected 36 kg of berries. 
On their way back, Marc's father lost 8 kg of berries. So, he now has 28 kg of berries (36 - 8 = 28).
Now, we know that Marcos berries weigh 12 kg. Therefore, the weight of his father's remaining berries is: 28 kg - 12 kg = 16 kg."
Response:  Firstly, Marcos and his father together collected 22 kg of berries. Then, his father found an additional 30 kg of berries while returning home. Therefore, the total weight of berries collected by Marcos and his father is: 22 + 30 = 52 kg. So, the weight of berries collected by Marcos's father alone is: 52 - 22 = 30 kg.
Response:  Since Marco and his father together have 30 kg of jams, and Marco's jam weighs 5 kg, then his father must have had 30 - 5 = 25 kg of jam.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 17 kg of jams. If Marco's jam weighs 30 kg, then his father's jam must weigh less than 30 - 17 = 13 kg. Therefore, Marco's jam is heavier than his father's by 13 kg - 17 kg = -4 kg. So, Marco's jam weighs -4 kg more than his father's.
Response:  Since Marco and his father together have 26 kg of jams, and Marco's jam weighs 10 kg, then his father must have had 16 kg of jam (26 - 10 = 16). Therefore, Marco's father's jar of jam is heavier than Marco's by 6 kg (16 - 10 = 6).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 30 kg of jams. If Marco's father's jam weighed 4 kg, then Marco's jam must have weighed (30 - 4) = 26 kg. Therefore, Marco's jam weighed 26 kg.
Response:  At first, there were 2 children in the bus. Then, another child got on at the bus station, so now there are 3 children in the bus. Finally, there are 10 children in the bus altogether. So, the difference between the number of children before and after the bus station is 7 (10 - 3). Therefore, the answer is 7 more children are in the bus than before the bus station.
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children in the bus. Then, another 38 children got into the bus at the station. So, now we have to calculate how many children are currently in the bus. The total number of children = Initial number of children + Number of new children who got into the bus = 26 + 38 = 64 children. Therefore, there are 64 children currently in the bus.
Response:  We know that initially there were 30 children in the bus and then 2 more children got on at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus before stopping was: 30 + 2 = 32 children. Therefore, the answer is 32.
Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the station, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, we can write an equation:  Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children remaining in the bus.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of children who got off = 21 - 43 = -22. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the station.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 41 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the station, there were 18 left in the bus. So, to find out how many more children were in the bus before the station than now, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number:

Number of children in the bus before the station = 41 - Number of children who got off

So, the answer is:

Number of children in the bus before the station = 41 - x
where x is the number of children who got off.

Since we are given that x = 20, we can plug this value into the equation above:

Number of children in the bus before the station = 41 - 20
= 21

Therefore, there were 21 more children in the bus before the station than there are now."
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus and 10 of them got off at the station. So, the number of children left in the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Then, some more children entered the bus, bringing the total to 16. Therefore, the number of children who entered the bus at the station is 16 - 11 = 5.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the bus and then 6 more got off at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus at first was 5 + 6 = 11. Now, we are told that some other children entered the bus while others left. Therefore, the final number of children in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number that got off, i.e., 11 - 6 = 5. Hence, 5 more children entered the bus than those who got off.
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and then 68 children got off at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus initially was 36 + 68 = 104. Now, some more children entered the bus, so the final number of children inside the bus is 12. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children is 104 - 12 = 92. Hence, 92 more children entered the bus than those who got off.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 children got off at the station. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 22 + 40 = 62. Now, we are told that 2 children remained in the bus after getting off at the station. Therefore, the final number of children in the bus is 62 - 2 = 60.
Response:  We know that there were initially 28 children in the bus and 82 children got off at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus at first was 28 + 82 = 110. Now, we are told that there were 30 children in the bus when they arrived at the station. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of children in the bus and the final number of children in the bus is: 110 - 30 = 80 children. So, 80 more children entered the bus than left it.
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus and 24 children got off at the station. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 23 + 24 = 47. Now, we are told that there were 8 children left in the bus. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who boarded the bus and those who got off is 47 - 8 = 39. Hence, 39 more children got off the bus than boarded it.
"Response:  We know that the baker made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them. So, we have:

Number of tarts left = Total number of tarts - Number of tarts sold = 133 - 51 = 82

Now, let's find out how many more tortes the baker has than he sold:

More torte than sold = Number of tarts left - Number of tarts sold = 82 - 51 = 31

So, there are 31 more tortes in the bakery than were sold."
Response:  The baker made 54 tarts and sold some of them. We don't know how many he sold, but we can assume it was a non-zero number. So, if he sold x torte, then he has 54 - x tortes left. Since he sold some of his tarts, he now has less than 54 tortes left. Therefore, the number of tortes he has left is 13 (the difference between 54 and the number of tors he sold).
"Response:  The baker made x co...

The baker made $x$ coconuts and sold $145$ of them. If he still has $72$ coconuts left, then we can find out how many coconuts the baker made by dividing the number of coconuts he sold by the price per coconut:

$$\frac{145}{x} = \frac{72}{x}$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 145 \times \frac{72}{145} = 100$$

So, the baker made $100$ coconuts."
"Response:  If the baker has made 155 tarts and his friend bought 140 cookies from him, then the number of tarts left with the baker is:

155 - 140 = 15

So, the baker still has 15 tarts left."
Response:  The baker made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) tarts left. Then, he bought 170 new cookies, which means he now has 33 (16 + 170) tarts in total. Therefore, the baker still has 33 tarts.
Response:  The baker made 13 tarts and sold 91 of them. So he has 13 - 91 = -78 left. Then he bought 154 new tortes. So he has -78 + 154 = 76 more torte than he had at first. Therefore, the number of torte that the baker bought is 76.
Response:  The baker made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 remaining (170 - 78 = 92). He also bought 31 new torts. Therefore, the number of tarts that the baker sold more than he bought is:  Number of tarts sold - Number of tarts bought = 92 - 31 = 61.  So, the baker sold 61 more tarts than he bought.
"Response:  The baker made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. Then he made another 76 cakes. So far, we have:
Tarts made = 110 Tarts sold = 75 + 76 = 151 Cakes made = 76
Now let's calculate how many cakes the baker still has: Total number of cakes = Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 76 - 75 = 1
So, the baker still has one cake left."
Response:  The baker made 144 tarts and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 tarts. So in total, the baker made 255 tarts (144 + 111). Since he sold 71 tarts, we can calculate how many more tarts the baker made than what he sold as follows: Number of tarts the baker made - Number of tarts sold = 255 - 71 = 184 tarts. Therefore, the baker made 184 more tarts than what he sold.
Response:  If the baker has made 149 cookies and 91 pies, then he has a total of 236 items (149 + 91 = 236).  If he sells 10 tarts and 90 pies, then he will have 236 - 10 - 90 = 46 left. So, the baker still has 46 items left.
Response:  The baker has made 7 tortas and 148 pies. If he sold 15 tortas and 103 pies, then he would have 7 - 15 = 9 tortas left and 148 - 103 = 45 pies left. So, the baker still has 9 tortas and 45 pies.
Response:  We know that the baker made 126 cookies and 48 pies. If he sold 115 tarts and 81 pies, then we can calculate how many more tarts than pies he made as follows: Number of tarts = Sold tarts - Made tarts = 115 - 126 = -11 tarts Number of pies = Sold pies - Made pies = 81 - 48 = 33 pies Therefore, the baker made more pies than tarts.
Response:  We know that Peka has made 19 tortes and 131 pies. If he sold 70 colachs and 88 pies, then we can calculate how many more pies he had than colaches. So, let's subtract the number of colaches from the total number of pies:  Number of pies = 131 - 70 = 61 pies. Therefore, Peka has more pies than colaches.
Response:  We know that the baker made 157 tortas and 169 pies. If he sold 158 tortas and 147 pies, then we can calculate how many more tortas were sold than pies as follows: Number of tortas sold = 158 Number of pies sold = 147 Difference between number of tortas and pies sold = 158 - 147 = 11 So, there are 11 more tortas sold than pies.
Response:  We know that the baker made 54 cookies and 143 pies. If he sold 68 cookies and 92 pies, then we can calculate how many pies the baker sold as follows: Number of pies sold = Total number of pies - Number of pies sold = 143 - (68 x 2) = 143 - 136 = 7 pies So, the baker sold 7 pies.
Response:  If the baker sold 44 tarts and made 48 cookies to start with, then he has 4 (48 - 44) extra cookies that he did not sell. So, the number of cookies the baker has is 4 + 4 = 8 more than the number of tarts he sold. Therefore, the baker has 44 + 8 = 52 cookies in total.
Response:  If the baker sold 8 tarts and made 40 cookies at first, then he must have made more than 8 times as many cookies as he sold tarts. So, if he sold 8 tarts, he must have made 8 x = 64 cookies (since 8 x = 64). Therefore, the baker made more than 64 cookies but fewer than 40.
Response:  At first, the baker had 169 kolač (colac) and gave 137 to his friend. So he still has 32 kolač (colac).
Response:  The baker made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones, so he has 173 - 103 = 70 old tarts left. He sold 86 of them, leaving him with 70 - 86 = 44 old tarts still in his possession. Therefore, the baker still has 44 tarts.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker made 99 tarts and bought 167 new croissants. Therefore, he has 99 + 167 = 266 croissants in total. Secondly, we are told that he sold 89 croissants. So, the number of croissants he has left is 266 - 89 = 177 croissants. Finally, to find out how many more croissants the baker bought than he sold, we subtract the number of croissants he sold from the number of croissants he had at first: 177 - 89 = 88 croissants. Therefore, the baker bought 88 more croissants than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 8 tarts and bought 139 new cookies. So he has 139 - 8 = 131 new cookies. He sold 145 cookies, so he sold all his new cookies plus some of the old ones (8). Therefore, he sold 131 + 8 = 139 cookies more than he bought.
Response:  Firstly, the baker made 62 tarts initially and then made another 149 tarts. So, in total, he has made 62 + 149 = 211 tarts. Now, he sold 144 of them, which means that he still has 211 - 144 = 67 tarts left with him. Therefore, the baker still has 67 tarts.
Response:  The baker made 81 colač and then made 92 tarts. If he sold 46 of them, that means he has 46 + 92 = 138 pastries left. So, the baker made more colač than he sold. Therefore, the answer is: More than 46.
Response:  We know that the baker has made 61 pies and 167 cookies. If he sold 108 cookies and 44 pies, then we can calculate how many pies the baker still has as follows: Number of pies the baker still has = Total number of pies - Number of pies sold = 61 - 44 = 17 So, the baker still has 17 pies.
Response:  We know that the baker has made 56 pies and 124 cookies. If he sold 104 cookies and 29 pies, then we can calculate how many pies the baker still has as follows: Number of pies the baker still has = Total number of pies - Number of pies sold = 56 - 29 = 27 So, the baker still has 27 pies.
Response:  The baker made 52 pies and 84 cookies. If he sold 102 cookies and 94 pies, then we can calculate how many more cookies than pies he sold as follows: Number of cookies sold = 102 Cookies + 94 Pies = 196 Total number of items sold = 52 Pies + 84 Cookies + 196 Items = 332 Now we know that there are 332 items in total, including both pies and cookies. Since the baker made 52 pies, the number of cookies he made is equal to the number of pies he sold minus the number of pies he made: Number of cookies made = Number of pies sold - Number of pies made = 196 - 52 = 144 Therefore, the baker made 144 more cookies than pies.
Response:  We know that Peka has made 134 pies and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pies, then we can calculate how many more pies he made than cakes as follows: Number of pies Peka made - Number of cakes Peka sold = +11 (Since Peka sold 11 cakes) Therefore, there are 11 more pies than cakes that Peka made.
Response:  We know that the baker made 14 tortes and 153 pies. If he sold 8 pies and 97 colach, then we can calculate how many more colach were sold than pies as follows: Number of colach sold = Total number of colach - Number of pies sold = 153 - 8 = 145 Therefore, the baker sold 145 colach more than pies.
Response:  We know that the baker made 43 cookies and 114 pies. If he sold 154 pies and 78 cookies, then we can calculate how many more pies were sold than cookies as follows: Number of pies sold - Number of cookies sold = 154 - 78 = 76 Therefore, there are 76 more pies sold than cookies.
Response:  Kel has 22 Nintendo games, and she wants to have 140 matches left after buying some more games. So we need to find out how many games she needs to buy in order to reach that number. We can do this by dividing the desired number of matches (140) by the number of matches she already has (22): Number of games needed = Desired matches / Existing matches = 140 / 22 = 6 Therefore, Kel needs to buy 6 more Nintendo games to have 140 matches left.
Response:  Kelly has 106 Nintendo games. If she gives up 64 of them, then she will have left with 42 games (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  Kelie had 91 Nintendo games at first and then got 9 more. So, she has 91 + 9 = 100 games now.
"Response:  Kel has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games Kel must give away to have 12 left, we can divide the number of Nintendo games she has (20) by the number of games she wants to have left (12):

20 / 12 = 16

So, Kel needs to give away 4 Nintendo games to have 12 left."
Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sonic games. To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to sell to have only 31 Sony games left, we need to subtract the number of Sony games she already has from the total number of games she owns. So, if we subtract 132 (the number of Sonic games) from 46 + 132 = 588, we get: 588 - 132 = 456. Therefore, Kelly needs to sell 456 Sony games in order to be left with only 31 Sony games.
"Response:  Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 more. To find out how many she will have left after buying these new ones, we need to subtract the number of new games from her total collection. So, the number of games she will have left is:

80 - 31 = 49

Therefore, Kelly will have 49 Nintendo games left after buying the additional 31 games."
Response:  Randi had 52 blocks to build his tower. If he used all of them, then he must have started with 52 - 38 = 14 blocks. So, Randi had 14 blocks at the beginning.
Response:  Randi has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he has used 72 blocks for building the tower, then we can say that he had 97 - 72 = 25 blocks left over after building the tower. So, Randi used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  Randi has 79 blocks and he uses 14 of them to build a tower. So, he has 79 - 14 = 65 blocks left. Then, he uses 11 more blocks to build a house. So, he has 65 + 11 = 76 blocks left. Therefore, there are 76 blocks remaining.
Response:  Randi has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower (or a cupola). So, he has left with 31 blocks. Now, he uses 53 of these remaining blocks to build a house. Therefore, in total, Randi used 27 + 53 = 80 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
"Response:  Randi has 37 blocks and he uses 33 of them to build a tower (or a ""кула"" in Serbian). So, he has 4 blocks left over after building the tower. Now, he uses 13 of those remaining blocks to build a house (""kuća""). Therefore, he used more blocks to build the tower than the house. The difference is 4 - 13 = -9 blocks. Since it can't be negative, we conclude that Randi used 9 more blocks to build the tower than the house."
Response:  Randi has used 86 blocks to build something. He has used 79 blocks to build a part of it (the cupola) and 82 blocks to build another part (the house). So he has used more blocks for building the house than for building the cupola. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for building the house and the number of blocks used for building the cupola is:  Number of blocks used for building the house - Number of blocks used for building the cupola = 82 - 79 = 3 blocks.  So Randi has used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the cupola.
Response:  Randi has 36 blocks to build his tower. If he uses all of them, then he will have none left over. So, if he has 59 blocks in total, that means he used some of them to build the tower and has 23 blocks left over (59 - 36 = 23).
"Response:  Randi has 95 blocks and he uses 20 of them to build a house and 50 of them to build a tower (or a castle). So, we can write:

House = 20 blocks
Tower = 50 - 20 = 30 blocks

Now, we need to find out how many more blocks were used for building the tower than for building the house. We can do this by subtracting the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks available:

Number of blocks used for tower = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for house
= 95 - 20
= 75 blocks

Therefore, Randi used 75 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response:  Randi has used 90 blocks to build his structure. He has used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the tower (or ""кула"" in Serbian). So, we can write an equation: Number of blocks used for the house = 89 Number of blocks used for the tower = 63 To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower = 89 - 63 = 26 Therefore, Randi has used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series ""Ludvigsen's Madhouse School"". If we have already read 5 of them, then we still need to read 15 more books. Therefore, the correct answer is 15."
"Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"" because we have already read them. So, if there are still 8 more books to be read, then the total number of books in the series is:

13 + 8 = 21

Therefore, there are 21 books in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School""."
Response:  We know that there are 22 books and 10 movies in the series. If you have read 12 books and watched 56 movies, then you still need to read 9 more books (22 - 12 = 10). So, the answer is 9.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 different books and 17 different movies in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then there are still 2 more movies to watch. Therefore, the answer is 2."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 13 films, then we can calculate how many more books there are than films as follows: Number of books - Number of films = 19 - 13 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more books than films in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 61 films, then we can calculate how many more films than books there are in the series as follows: Number of films = 61 - 19 = 42 Therefore, there are 42 more films than books in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 13 books and watched 12 films, then you have more books than films. Therefore, we can conclude that you have read 3 more books (13 - 10 = 3) than films (12)."
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 films in the series. If we have read 7 books and watched 21 films, then we can calculate how many more films we have watched than books as follows: Number of films watched - Number of books read = 21 - 7 = 14 Therefore, we have watched 14 more films than books in the series.
"Response:  We know that you have already read 8 books from the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". Therefore, there are 6 more books left to be read in the series (since there are 14 books in total). So, you need to read 6 more books from the series."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different books in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies, how many more books do you need to read?  To find out, we can use the following calculation: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books already read Total number of books = 19 - 4 = 15 So, you still need to read 15 more books."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different movies and 21 different books in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then there are still 3 more movies to watch (since 4 - 7 = 3). Therefore, you need to watch 3 more movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books in the series and we have read them all.  Therefore, there are 11 - 11 = 0 books left to read in the series.  Now, let's count the number of movies we have watched. According to the question, we have watched 40 movies out of a total of 44 movies in the series. So, the number of movies we have not seen is 44 - 40 = 4.  Therefore, there are 4 more movies left to watch in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""Looney Tunes"". If you have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, how many more movies than books are there in the series? To find out, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of movies: 63 - 13 = 50 Therefore, there are 50 more movies than books in the Looney Tunes series."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 14 films and seen 19 books, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than films as follows: Number of books read - Number of films watched = 19 - 14 = 5 Therefore, you have read 5 more books than films in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series ""Ludwig's Crazy School"". If you have read 19 films and seen 16 books, it means that you have more movies than books. So, we can conclude that you have watched more movies than books. Therefore, the answer is ."
Response:  We know that Dave has 7 cards and he used some of them to buy toys. So, if he still has 2 cards left, then he must have used x number of cards to buy y toys, where x is the number of cards he used and y is the number of toys he bought. Now we are given that Dave spent $10 on each toy, so the total amount he spent on buying toys is $x + $y. Since Dave had $35 initially, we can set up the equation: $x + $y = $35. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 4 and y = 6. Therefore, Dave used 4 cards to buy 6 toys.
Response:  We know that Dave has already used 12 cards to buy some toys. So he still has 14 cards left. Therefore, the number of cards Dave won in the game is 14 - 12 = 2.
Response:  If Dave has won 18 cards and he used 5 of them to buy some toys, then he had 18 - 5 = 13 cards left.  And if he used 11 more cards to buy clothes, then he had 13 - 11 = 2 cards left. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Dave has won 19 cards and he used 12 to buy some toys and 7 to buy clothes, then we can say that: Number of cards Dave used for buying clothes = 7 Number of cards Dave used for buying toys = 12 - 7 = 5 Therefore, more cards were used to buy toys than to buy clothes.
Response:  We know that Dave has won 13 cards and he used 8 of them to buy clothes. So, he has 5 remaining cards (13 - 8 = 5). Now, we need to find out how many more cards Dave needs to buy clothes than he needs to buy toys. To do this, we divide the number of cards Dave needs for clothes by the number of cards he actually used for clothes. In this case, we have: Number of cards needed for clothes = 5 / 8 = 0.625 or approximately 1/1.6. Therefore, Dave needs 1.6 times as many cards to buy clothes as he used to buy clothes.
Response:  Dave has won 14 cards and lost 2 cards, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 cards left. If he used 10 of those cards to buy some toys, then he has 12 - 10 = 2 cards left. Therefore, there are 2 cards left.
Response:  According to the question, Heather had 14 trees in her backyard before Typhoon 9 hit. After the typhoon, only 5 of those trees survived. So, we can conclude that 9 trees died (i.e., were destroyed) due to the typhoon. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  According to the question, Heather had 13 trees in her backyard before Typhoon 6 hit. After the typhoon, 6 of the trees died. So, the number of surviving trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, 7 trees survived the typhoon.
Response:  If Haley planted 20 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon only 4 remained, then we can conclude that 16 trees have died (or perished) due to the typhoon. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  If Haley planted 3 trees after Tornado 5 died and she now has 12 trees in total, then we can conclude that each tree grew to be twice as tall as it was initially (since there are now 4 times as many trees). So, if the initial height of each tree was x meters, then the current height is 2x meters. Therefore, the answer is 12(2x) = 24x meters.
Response:  Initially, Hayley had 9 trees in her backyard after the typhoon passed. Then she planted another 5 trees. So, the total number of trees is: 9 + 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 trees left in Hayley's backyard.
"Response:  After the typhoon, two trees in Haylie's garden died. If she had planted 12 trees initially, then the number of remaining trees is:

Remaining trees = Initial number of trees - Number of dead trees
= 12 - 2
= 10

Therefore, there are 10 trees left in Haylie's garden after the typhoon."
Response:  We know that after the typhoon, 13 trees in Haylie's garden were dead. If we assume that initially, she planted 3 more trees than the number of trees that survived the typhoon (i.e., 3 + x = 10), then we can deduce that x = 7. Therefore, 7 trees died in the typhoon and only 3 survived.
Response:  At first, there were 11 trees planted in Haylie's garden. After the typhoon, only 5 trees survived. So, the number of trees that survived is 5.
"Response:  If they collect 66 jars of portocali per day and each jar contains 28 portocali, then...

Answer: They collect 66 x 28 = 1744 portocali per day."
Response: 1 day = 8 portions of pasta (according to the problem) So, if he wants to collect 24 portions of pasta, it will take him: 24 / 8 = 3 days Therefore, he will need 3 days to collect 24 portions of pasta.
Response: 1 day = 24 hours 1 hour = 60 minutes 1 minute = 60 seconds So, in 1 day, he collected 24/60 = 1/4 of a basket per hour. Since there are 4 days left before the harvest ends, he will collect 4 x 1/4 = 1/2 of a basket in total. Therefore, he will have collected 56 / 2 = 28 baskets of portocali.
"Response:  If they collect 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 portocales, then in 49 days they will have collected:

38 x 49 = 1762 baskets

So, after 49 days of harvesting, there will be 1762 baskets of portocales."
Response:  If they collect 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 portocals, then in one day they will collect 66 x 25 = 1600 portocals.  To find out how many portocals there will be after 87 days, we multiply the number of portocals collected per day by 87: 1600 x 87 = 134,600 portocals.
"Response:  If they collect 8 times a day and each time they collect 35 portocals, then they collect in total:

8 x 35 = 280 porocals per day"
"Response:  If they collect 16 times per day and each time they collect 57 portocals, then in one day they will collect:

16 x 57 = 922 portocals

So, to collect 80 times 57 portocals (which is equal to 4480 portocals), it would take them:

4480 / 922 = 4.8 days

Therefore, it would take them approximately 4.8 days to collect 80 times as many portocals as they collect in one day."
"Response:  If they collect 67 jars of portocali every day and each jar contains 12 portocali, then they collect in total:

67 jars/day x 12 portocali/jar = 804 portocali/day

Now, if they collect 35 jars of portocali in total, we can calculate how many portocali they collected per day as follows:

Total number of portocali / Number of days they collected = Daily collection of portocali

So, the daily collection of portocali is:

804 portocali/day / 35 jars = 23.49 portocali/jam"
Response:  If they collect 74 baskets of portulacca per day and throw away 71 of them, then after 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 3920 baskets (74 x 51 = 3920). So, the number of baskets of portulacca that will remain after 51 days is 3920 - 71 = 3849 baskets.
"Response:  If they collect 76 baskets per day and discard 64 of them, that means they have collected 12 baskets more than they have discarded. So, if each basket contains 50 portocali, then the total number of portocali collected is:

$$ Total = \text {Number of baskets collected} - \text{ Number of baskets discarded } = 12 - 64 = -52 $$

So, the answer is $ -52$."
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 784 tempora of mature portulacas and 52 x 26 = 1320 tempora of immature portulacas. Therefore, after 26 days, the total number of tempora of portulacas will be 784 + 1320 = 2094 tempora.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 temporarily zrelih portokala and 61 x 25 = 1525 non-ripe portokala. So, the number of temporarily ripe portokala after 25 days of harvesting is 2050.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 24 x 45 = 1080 temporaries of unripe portulacas. So, the number of temporary unripe portulacas after 45 days of harvesting is 1080.
Response: 44 + 25 = 69. So, they collect 69 times more mature portulacas than immature ones daily.
Response:  If they collect 5 times more zucchini than peppers daily, then they collect 5 x 74 = 370 non-zesty portocales per day. So, the number of non-zesty portocales collected is greater than the number of zesty portocales collected by 370 - 5 = 365.
Response:  If they have harvested 54 baskets of portulacca per day and they are harvesting 18 baskets per day, it means that in total they will need 3 days to collect all the portulacca. Therefore, the answer is 3 days.
"Response:  If they collected 56 jars of portulaca per day for 14 days, then the total number of jars collected is:

56 x 14 = 792

So, there were 792 jars in total collected over the 14-day period."
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 73 = 1825 unripe portulacas and 5 x 73 = 365 ripe portulacas. So, the total number of ripened portulacas after 73 days is: 1825 + 365 = 2190.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 6 = 36 tempora of immature portulacas and 46 x 6 = 276 tempora of mature portulacas. So, the number of tempora of immature portulacas after 6 days of harvesting is 36.
Response:  If they collect 41 times as many immature portulacas and 86 times as many mature portulacas per day, then we can write this relationship mathematically as follows: $ \text{number of immature portulacas} = k \times \text{number of mature portulacas} $ where $k$ is a constant. Since there are $28$ days in a month, we can express this equation as follows: $\text{number of immature portulacas per day} = k \times \text{number of mature portulacas per day} \times 28$. Solving for $k$, we get: $k = \frac{\text{number of mature portulacas per day}}{28}$. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $k = \frac{86}{28} = 3$. Therefore, the number of mature portulacas collected per day is $3 \times 41 = 123$. So, the difference between the number of mature and immature portulacas collected per day is: $123 - 41 = 82$.
Response: 71 + 60 = 131. So, more nezreli portocala are collected than zerele portocala dally. The ratio of nezreli to zerele portocala is 131:60 or 2:1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer it is than its width, we need to divide the length by the width. So, let's do this calculation: Length / Width = 12 ft / 11 ft = 1.09 (approximately) Therefore, Jessie's room is approximately 10% longer than its width.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 7 feet long. So, if we divide this length by 3 (since there are 3 feet in a foot), we get 2 feet. Now, we need to find out how wide Jessie's room is. We know that it is 14 square feet, so its width must be equal to this value divided by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is 14/12 = 1 foot.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is wide 2 meters. So, if we divide this value with length of teppich (which is given as 14 kva. sq. ft.), we will get the length of teppich in meters.  Therefore, the length of teppich = 2 m / 14 kva. sq. ft. = 0.1433 m.  Now, since we know that the width of teppich is equal to its length, we can conclude that the width of teppich is also 0.1433 m.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 11 meters long and 15 meters wide. Therefore, the area of her room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 11 m x 15 m = 165 square meters (since there are 10 meters in a meter). Now, we need to find out how many square meters of carpet she needs to cover the entire floor. To do this, we divide the total area of the room by the size of each square foot of carpet: Number of square feet of carpet needed = Total area / Size of one square foot of carpet = 165 sqm / 0.1047 sqm = 1582 square feet (since there are 0.1047 square meters in a square foot). So, Jessie needs approximately 1582 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 2 steps long and 12 steps wide. So, if we divide the length of the room by the width of each step, we get: Length = 2 steps / Width = 12 steps / 4 kq = 3 square feet per step. Therefore, to cover the entire floor area of Jessie's room with tiles, she needs: Number of tiles = Area of room / Size of tile = 108 square feet / 3 square feet/step = 36 steps x 12 steps = 432 tiles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 7 meters long and 7 meters wide, which means it has an area of 49 square meters (m²). Therefore, if there are 20 rooms in total, their combined area would be: Area = Number of rooms x Room area = 20 x 49 = 980 m² So, there will be 980 tiles needed to cover the floors of all 20 rooms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 6 meters wide and 6 meters long. So, its area can be calculated as follows: Area = Width x Length = 6 m x 6 m = 36 square meters Now, we want to find out how much longer Jessie's room is than it is wide. To do this, we need to divide the length of the room (6 meters) by its width (6 meters): Length / Width = 6/6 = 1 Therefore, Jessie's room is 1 meter longer than it is wide.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie needs to cover her room with a carpet of area 10 square meters. Since she has a rectangular room, its length is equal to twice its width (since it is a rectangle). So, if the room is 5 feet long and 3 feet wide, then its length is 2 x 3 = 6 feet, and its width is 3 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 6 ft x 3 ft = 18 sq ft. Now, since Jessie wants to use a carpet of area 10 square meters, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of the carpet: Area of Carpet = Room Area / 10 = 18 sq ft / 10 = 1.8 sq m. So, Jessie needs approximately 1.8 square meters of carpet to cover her room.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie needs to cover her room with a carpet of 10 square meters. Now, let's find out how wide and long is her room. According to the question, her room is twice as wide as it is long. So if she has a room that is x wide, then its length will be 2x. We are also given that the width of the room is twice the length, so we can write: 2x = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 5 meters. Therefore, Jessie's room is 5 meters wide and 10 meters long.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet. Since her room is 4 steps long and 20 steps wide, its area can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet Now, since Jessie wants to cover the entire floor with carpet, she needs enough carpet to cover the total area of the room. Therefore, the number of square feet of carpet she will need is equal to the total area of the room minus the area she already has (i.e., the 18 square feet she already has). So, the number of square feet of carpet Jessie will need is: Number of square feet of carpet needed = Total area - Already covered area = 80 - 18 = 62 square feet
Response:  We know that the shop makes $23 per sold t-shirt and Arkansas and Texas together sold 230 t-shirts. So, we can calculate the total amount of money made by the shop as follows: Total amount = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 230 t-shirts x $23/t-shirt = $5,170 Therefore, the correct answer is $5,170.
Response:  We know that the store made $51 in total sales during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Since they sold 3 maillots, we can calculate the cost of each maillot as follows: Cost per maillot = Total sales / Number of maillots = $51 / 3 = $17 Each maillot costs $17.
Response:  We know that the store earned $87 per sold t-shirt and they sold 95 t-shirts in total during both games in Arkansas and Texas. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, their revenue from those sales would be:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 47 x $87 = $3,899.
Response:  We know that the store earned $106 per sold t-shirt and they sold a total of 242 t-shirts during both games in Arkansas and Texas. So, if they sold 115 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then they must have sold 127 t-shirts during the game in Texas. Therefore, the answer is 127.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the store earned $98 for each sold t-shirt. Therefore, if they sold 89 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, they earned $89 x $98 = $8572 in total from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas.  Now, let's calculate how much money they earned from selling t-shirts during the game in Texas. Since they sold 74 t-shirts there, and they earned $98 per t-shirt, they earned $74 x $98 = $7096 in total from selling t-shirts during the game in Texas.  Finally, we add up the amount of money they earned from both games to get the total amount of money they earned from selling t-shirts during their trip: $8572 + $7096 = $15678.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the store earned $78 for each sold t-shirt during the game in Arkansas and Texas combined. Therefore, if they sold 172 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas alone, their total earnings from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas would be:  Total earnings = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 172 x $78 = $13,040. Now, let's find out how much money they earned from selling t-shirts during the game in Texas. Since they sold 186 t-shirts during both games combined, and they earned $78 for each sold t-shirt, their total earnings from selling t-shirts during the game in Texas can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 186 x $78 = $14,508. So, the store earned a total of $27,548 from selling t-shirts during the two games combined.

Secondly, during the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 hoodies. Finally, we need to calculate how much money the shop earned from these sales. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the shop is: $$ Total = Number of t-shirts \times Price per t-shirt + Number of hoodies \times Price per hoodie $$ Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $$ Total = 74 \times 67 + 156 \times 165 $$ Simplifying and solving for the total amount of money earned, we get: $$ Total = 4920 + 2530 $$ Therefore, the shop earned a total of $7450 from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue of the store is $192 + $34 = $226.  Then, during the game Arkansas and Texas sold 157 + 19 = 176 maijcas. Therefore, the average cost per t-shirt is: $\frac{Total Revenue}{Number of T-Shirts} = \frac{226}{176} = 1.28$ dollars per t-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue of the shop is $86 + $232 = $318 per each t-shirt sold.  Secondly, we are told that they sold 254 t-shirts during the game Arkansas vs Texas, and their total revenue from these sales was $254 x $318 = $87,092. Lastly, we are given that they sold 43 t-shirts during the game Arkansas vs Texas, and their total revenue from these sales was $43 x $318 = $13,691. Therefore, the difference in cost between one t-shirt and another is $318 - $136 = $182.
Response:  The shop sells each t-shirt for $51. During the game Arkansas and Texas, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. So, their total revenue from selling t-shirts is: Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 130 x $51 = $6,430.
Response:  The original price of each t-shirt is $201. During the game, Arkansas and Texas Tech increased the prices to $217 per t-shirt and sold 14 t-shirts. Therefore, the total amount earned from selling t-shirts during the game is:  Number of t-shirts sold = 14 t-shirts Price per t-shirt = $217 per t-shirt Total amount earned = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 14 t-shirts x $217 per t-shirt = $3,058 So, they earned $3,058 from selling t-shirts during the game.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $60. If they sold each t-shirt for $10, then the number of t-shirts sold is:

$60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts

So, they sold 6 t-shirts in total."
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $215 and they sold 5 t-shirts. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of each t-shirt as follows: Cost = Total Amount / Number of T-Shirts = $215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the shop ""Бриљачица"" earns $5 for each t-shirt and $215 for each hoodie.  Secondly, during the game Arkansas vs Texas, they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 hoodies. Therefore, their total revenue from these sales is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie  Revenue = 20 x $5 + 64 x $215  Revenue = $1,000 + $13,700  Revenue = $14,700 So, the shop earned $14,700 in revenue from those sales."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the shop ""Бриљачица"" earns $76 per each t-shirt and $204 per each hoodie.  Secondly, during the game Arkansas vs Texas, they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 hoodies. Therefore, their total revenue from these sales is:

Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie
= 158 x $76 + 2 x $204
= $11,932
So, the shop ""Бриљачица"" earned $11,932 from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game Arkansas vs Texas."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue of the store is $210 + $240 = $450 per each t-shirt sold.  Secondly, we are told that they sold 177 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and 23 t-shirts during the Texas game. Therefore, the total number of t-shirts sold is 177 + 23 = 200 t-shirts. Finally, we can calculate the average price of each t-shirt as follows: Total revenue / Number of t-shirts sold = $450 / 200 = $2.25 per t-shirt. So, the cost of one t-shirt is $2.25.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue of the store is $115 + $25 = $140 per each t-shirt sold.  Secondly, we are told that they sold 113 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and 78 t-shirts during the Texas game. Therefore, the total number of t-shirts sold is 113 + 78 = 191 t-shirts. Finally, we need to find out how much more money the store made from selling t-shirts during the Texas game than during the Arkansas game. So, let's calculate it as follows: ($140 x 78) - ($140 x 113) = $10,640 - $130 = $10,510. Therefore, the store made $10,510 more from selling t-shirts during the Texas game than during the Arkansas game.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. So, there are 50 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If there are two groups of people with the same number of chairs (12), then each group has half of the total number of chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is twice the number of groups. So, if there are 2 groups, then there are 2 x 12 = 24 chairs in all.
Response:  We know that there are several groups of tables with 3 chairs each in the backyard. So, we have: Number of groups = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per group = 9 chairs / 3 chairs/group = 3 groups. Therefore, there are 3 sets of tables in the backyard.
Response:  If they have decided to hold a party in their backyard and they have 11 sets of tables with each set having 13 chairs, then we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows: Total number of chairs = Number of sets x Number of chairs per set = 11 x 13 = 143 chairs. Therefore, there are 143 chairs in the backyard.
Response:  We have 10 sets of tables with 6 chairs each, so we have in total 60 chairs. If there are 11 people sitting at the chairs and only 60 chairs available, then some people will not be able to sit down. The number of unoccupied chairs is equal to the number of people who cannot find a chair to sit on. Therefore, the answer is 5 (since 11 - 60 = 5).
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. However, we were also told that there are 6 more chairs than needed for the guests. So, if we subtract 6 from 168, we get 162 chairs available for the guests.
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and they have 4 sets of tables with 3 chairs each, then the total number of chairs needed is:  14 x 4 = 56 chairs. So, additional 20 chairs will be needed to accommodate all the guests.
Response:  If they have decided to hold an entertainment in their backyard and they have 14 chairs for each pair of tables, then we can assume that there are 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of tables (or 56 tables). Since they have 9 sets of tables, this means that each set contains 56 / 9 = 6 tables. Therefore, they have more than 9 tables. The correct answer is 10.
Response:  If Luiz earns $460 during 5 weeks of harvest, that means he earned $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks).
"Response:  If Luiz earned $1216 during harvest season and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks the harvest season lasted as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 75 weeks

So, the harvest season lasted for 75 weeks."
Response:  We know that Luiz earns $21 per week during 216 weeks of harvest. Therefore, his total income for the season is: $$ \text {Total income} = \text {Weekly income} \times \text {Number of weeks} = 21 \times 216 = 4360 \ dollars$$. Now we need to find out how much tax he needs to pay. The tax amount can be calculated as follows: $$ \text{Tax} = \frac{\text{Total income}}{1 - \text{Tax rate}} $$ where $\text{tax rate}$ is the percentage of tax that Luiz needs to pay. Since we are not given any information about the tax rate, let's assume it to be 25%. So, the tax amount would be: $$ \text{Tax} = \frac{4360}{1 - 0.25} = 1090 \ dollars$$ Therefore, at the end of the season, Luiz will have $3270 ($4360-$1090) in his pocket.
"Response:  If Luiz earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks of harvest season, his total income will be:

$1357 x 223 = $294,061

Now, if he works for 73 seasons, his total income will be:

$294,061 x 73 = $20,833,333

Therefore, Luiz will have earned approximately $20,833,333 over 73 seasons of working in the harvest season at an income of $1357 per week."
Response:  Firstly, Luis earns $28 per week during 109 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total earnings from harvesting are: $$ \text {Total earnings from harvesting} = 109 \times 28 = 3,060 $$ dollars. Secondly, he works overtime for an additional 45 hours per week, which means he earns $939 per week in addition to his regular income. So, his total weekly earnings become: $$ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 3060 + 939 = 4000 $$ dollars per week. Now, if he works overtime for more than 45 hours per week, how much extra money does he make? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of hours he works overtime from 45 hours. For example, if he works 55 hours overtime per week, then he makes: $$ \text{Extra money earned through overtime} = 45 - 55 = -10 $$ dollars less per week. Therefore, Luis makes a total of $4000 + (-10) = $4010 per week.
Response:  We know that Luis earns $403 per week during 233 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income for the season is: $$ Total Income = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Earnings = 233 \times 403 = 93,130$$ Now, we need to find out how much he pays in rent each week. According to the question, he pays $49 per week in rent. So, his weekly rent is: $$ Weekly Rent = Total Income / Number of Weeks = 93,130 / 233 = 387$$ There you have it! Luis pays $387 in rent each week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Luiz earns $368 per week during 1359 weeks of harvest season. Therefore, he earns a total amount of $472,080 ($368 x 1359) in one year.  Now, let's find out how much he pays as rent each week. According to the question, if he pays $388 per week as rent, then he pays a total amount of $52,672 ($388 x 1359) in one year. So, the difference between what he earns and what he pays as rent is: $$472,080 - $52,672 = $419,408$$ This means that Luiz has $419,408 left after paying his rent each week.
Response:  We know that Luis earns $491 per week during 118 weeks of harvest season. If he has to pay $216 in rent each week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season? To find out, we need to calculate the total amount of money Luis will have earned during the harvest season and subtract the total amount he will have paid in rent. Total amount earned = Number of weeks x Weekly income = 118 x $491 = $57,388 Total amount paid in rent = Number of weeks x Rent per week = 118 x $216 = $24,068 Now, let's see how much money Luis will have left after paying his rent for the entire harvest season: Money left = Total amount earned - Total amount paid in rent = $57,388 - $24,068 = $33,320 So, Luis will have $33,320 left after paying his rent for the entire harvest season.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Luís worked for 19 weeks and earned $133 in total. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide his total earnings by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Luís earns $7 per week.
Response:  If Luiz earns $2 per week during harvest time and there are 4 weeks of harvest, then he earns: $$ = 2 \times 4 = 8$ dollars in total for harvest time. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of days that Luiz works is: $$ = 8 \div 7 = 1$$ day per week. Therefore, Luiz works 1 day per week during harvest time.
Response:  We know that Dino is 5 feet (60 inches) tall and the water is 10 times deeper than his height, so the depth of the water is 600 inches or 50 feet. Since he stands on the bottom of the sea at 9 feet below the surface, we subtract 9 from 50 to get 41 feet. So, the correct answer is 41 feet.
Response:  We know that Dino is 8 feet (or 8 st) tall and Ron is 6 feet (or 6 st) tall.  The water was twice as deep as Din's height, so it would be 2 x 8 = 16 feet deep for him. Since Ronaldo is 6 ft shorter than Din, he would be at a depth of 16 - 6 = 10 ft below the surface. So, the answer is 10 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron is 12 feet tall and the water depth is 5 times Ron's height, so water depth = 5 x 12 = 60 feet. Since Dyn is 11 feet shorter than Ron, Dyn = 11 - 12 = -1 foot. So, if Ron stood at 12 feet high, the water would have been 60 - 1 = 59 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Dino is 4 feet tall and Ron is 13 feet tall. If they are both standing in water of equal depth, then their heights will be equivalent to the depth of the water below them. So if the water is 15 times deeper than Din's height, it means that Ron must be at least 15 x 4 = 60 feet above the surface of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water is 60 - 13 = 47 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron is 13 feet tall and the water depth is 16 times greater than his height. So, we can write: Water depth = 16 x 13 = 208 feet. Now, we are also given that Dyn is 9 feet taller than Ron. Therefore, we can write: Dyn's height = Ron's height + 9 = 13 + 9 = 22 feet. Finally, we want to find out how deep the water was relative to Dyn's height. So, we subtract Dyn's height from the water depth: Water depth - Dyn's height = 208 - 22 = 186 feet.
"Response:  We know that Ron is 15 meters tall and DIn is 6 meters tall. So, if they are both standing in water with a depth of 9 times Di n's height, then we can calculate the depth as follows:
Depth = 9 x Height of Din = 9 x 6 = 54 meters
So, the water is 54 meters deep."
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and divides them equally among 2 shelves, then he will have 34/2 = 17 books on each shelf. Therefore, Brian has 17 books on each of the two shelves.
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf contains 2 books, then we can calculate the number of shelves as follows:

Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 42 / 2
= 21

So, there are 21 shelves in total."
Response:  Brain has 27 books and 80 magazines at each of his 23 bookshelves. So, he has a total number of books = 27 x 23 = 611 books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines = 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines. Therefore, in total, Brian has 611 + 1840 = 2451 items on his bookshelves.
"Response:  Brain has 9 books and 46 magazines per month on each of his 10 shelves. Therefore, he has a total of:

9 x 10 = 90 books
46 x 10 = 460 magazines
So, Brian has a total of 90 + 460 = 550 publications in all."
Response:  Brain has 23 books and 61 magazines in total. If he has them organized into 29 boxes with each box containing how many books and magazines, we can find out by dividing the total number of books and magazines by the number of boxes. So, if each box contains 4 books and 4 magazines, then:  Number of books = Total number of books / Number of boxes = 23 / 29 = 0.79 (approximately)  Number of magazines = Total number of magazines / Number of boxes = 61 / 29 = 0.21 (approximately) Therefore, Brain has approximately 0.79 books and 0.21 magazines in each box.
"Response:  Brain has 7 shelves with the same number of books. If he has a total of 28 books, then each shelf must have:

$ Number of books = Total number of books / Number of shelves $
= 28 / 7 $
= 4 $$
So there are 4 books on each shelf."
Response:  Brain has looked at and his books are as follows:  Each shelf contains 2 books. How many shelves does he have in total?  Therefore, there are 38 books in total.
"Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 10 friends and each package of invitations contained 2 invitations, then we need to calculate how many packages Carol needs to send in order for no friend to be left out.

Let X be the number of packages Carol sends. Since there are 10 friends and each package contains 2 invitations, the total number of invitations Carol needs to send is 10 x 2 = 20.

So, we can write an equation: X + 20 = 100 (where 100 is the total number of invitations needed).

Solving for X, we get: X = 80. Therefore, Carol needs to send 80 packages of invitations to ensure that none of her 10 friends are left out."
Response:  Carol sent invitations to 12 friends for her birthday party. She bought three packages of invitations with the same number of invitations in each package. Therefore, there are 3 x 12 = 36 invitations in total.
"Response:  Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party and bought 7 packages of invitations, each package containing 10 invitations. If she only sends invitations to 2 friends, then the number of remaining invitations is:

Number of invitations = Number of invitations in one package x Number of packages purchased - Number of invitations sent
= 10 x 7 - 2
= 70 - 2
= 68
Therefore, there will be 68 invitations left over after Carol sends them to her 2 friends."
Response:  Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday. Each package of invitations she bought had 14 invitations in it and she bought 6 packages. So, she sent out a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, so the final number of invitations she sent is 84 + 11 = 95. Therefore, Carol can potentially invite 95 people to her party.
Response:  Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party and each package of invitations she bought contained three invitations. Since she bought two packages, she sent a total of six invitations (3 x 2 = 6). So, if she wants to invite 9 friends in total, she will need to buy additional invitations equal to 3 (the number of invitations per package) more than the total number of friends she wants to invite. Therefore, Carol needs to buy 3 + 9 = 12 extra invitations.
Response:  Melisa has scored 12 points in each game, so she has scored a total of 12 x 5 = 60 points in all games. Therefore, the number of games played is 60 / 12 = 5 games.
Response:  Melisa has played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points. Since she scored the same number of points in each game (as stated in the question), we can assume that her scoring average is equal to 81/3 = 27 points per game. Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  Melisa has scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points in each game. To find out how many total points she has scored, we can add these two amounts together:  Total points = 109 + 82 = 191 points per game. Since there were 79 games in total, Melisa has scored 191 x 79 = 14,633 points in all. Therefore, her overall score is 14,633 points.
Response:  We know that Melisa has scored a total of 21 points playing some games. If she scored 7 points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of games = Total score / Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of games = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melisa played 3 games.
Response:  Melisa has scored 91 points in total and she achieved this result in every game. Therefore, we can say that her average score per game is also 91/13 = 7 points per game. So, Melisa scored 7 points in each of her games.
Response:  We know that Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 4 seats. If 20 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously, then we need to divide 20 by the number of seats on the Ferris wheel. So, if there are 4 seats on the Ferris wheel, then 20 / 4 = 5 people can sit on each seat. Therefore, 5 people can sit on each seat.
Response:  We know that Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has several seats. Each seat can accommodate 9 people. If 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously, how many seats does the weekend ticket have?  So, we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats there are. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that each circle in Paradise Park has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. To find out how many people can ride 20 circles at once, we need to calculate the total number of people who can fit in all 20 circles. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of people = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat x 100%  Number of seats = 19 x 15 = 285 People Percentage = 285 / 20 = 14.25 people per circle  So, approximately 14.25 people can ride 20 circles at once.
Response:  We know that Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, how many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time? To find out, we need to divide the total number of people who can fit on the Ferris wheel (18 x 15 = 270) by the number of working seats (10). Therefore, if 10 seats are broken, 270 / 10 = 27 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.
Response:  We know that Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. Now, if there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, how many more people can join it? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people who are already on the Ferris wheel from the total capacity of the Ferris wheel. So, the answer is: Number of additional people = Total capacity - Number of people already on the Ferris wheel = 6 x 14 = 84 - 16 = 68 people. Therefore, up to 68 more people can join the Ferris wheel.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in Ferris wheel in Paradise Park. If we assume that each small seat can accommodate 14 people, then the total capacity of small seats is:  Number of small seats = 2 x 14 = 28 people. Now, let's find out how many people can fit on the large seats: Number of large seats = 23 people. Since each large seat can accommodate 54 people, the total capacity of large seats is: Total capacity = Number of large seats x Capacity per large seat = 23 x 54 = 1208 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on the Ferris wheel in Paradise Park is: Total capacity = Number of small seats + Number of large seats = 28 + 1208 = 1236 people. So, the answer to the question is 1236 people.
Response:  We know that there are 7 large seats in Ferris wheel and each can accommodate 12 people. So, total number of people who can ride on the big swings = 7 x 12 = 84 people. Now, we have to subtract the number of people who can ride on small seats. There are 3 small seats and each can accommodate 16 people. So, total number of people who can ride on small seats = 3 x 16 = 48 people. Therefore, the final answer is 84 - 48 = 36 people.
"Response:  If there are 16 people going to the picnic in the park at the same time and each car can carry 4 passengers, then we need to find out how many cars will be needed for all these people. So, we divide 16 by 4 to get the number of cars required:

16 / 4 = 4

So, 4 cars will be needed to transport all 16 people to the picnic in the park simultaneously."
Response:  If 4 people can go for a weekend in a park together, that means they will occupy 4 seats. Since each seat can accommodate 2 people, we have 8 seats in total (4 x 2 = 8). Therefore, there are 8 seats available to accommodate all 4 people at once.
Response:  We have 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of slices. Therefore, we can say that the total number of slices is 7 x Number of slices in one pizza = 7 x 8 = 56 slices. So there are 56 di...
Response:  If each pizza has 2 slices and we ordered a total of 28 slices, then: Number of pizzas = Total number of slices / Number of slices per pizza  Number of pizzas = 28 / 2  Number of pizzas = 14 So, we ordered 14 pizzas.
Response:  We were asked to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total if 17 pizzas have been ordered and each pizza has 4 slices. So, we need to multiply 17 by 4 to get the total number of slices: 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. Therefore, there are 68 parchments of pizza in total.
Response:  We have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If we divide them equally between two people, how many slices will each person get?  To find out, let's use division. So, if we divide 9 by 2, we get 4.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a slice, each person will get 4 whole slices of pizza. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Pejja helped her mother plant seeds and together they planted 10 seeds in each flower pot. So, if there are 45 flower pots, then the total number of seeds planted is:  Number of seedlings x Number of seeds per seedling = 45 flower pots x 10 seeds/flower pot = 450 seeds Total number of seeds planted = 450 seeds
Response:  We know that Pejja helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 45 seeds in 9 flower beds. So, if we divide 45 by 9, we get 5 seeds per flower bed. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Pejg helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower pot and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each pot. So, we can calculate the number of flower pots as follows: Number of flower pots = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per pot = 36 / 12 = 3 Since there are 3 flower pots with 58 seeds growing into flowers each, the total number of flower pots is 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3.
Response:  We know that Pejja helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower pot and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each pot. So, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total number of seeds = Number of seeds in each pot x Number of pots = 15 seeds/pot x 3 pots = 45 seeds Total number of flowers = Total number of seeds x Success rate = 45 seeds x 60% = 27 flowers Therefore, there are 27 flowers that grew from the 55 seeds planted by Pejja and her mother.
Response:  If Pejja helped her mother plant 10 seeds in each flower pot and they planted 60 seeds altogether, then we can calculate the number of flower pots as follows: Number of flower pots = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per flower pot = 60 seeds / 10 seeds per flower pot = 6 flower pots. Therefore, there would be 6 flower pots if they planted 60 seeds altogether.
Response:  We know that Pejja helped her mother to plant flowers in 8 flower beds. If they planted an equal number of seeds in each bed, then the total number of seeds planted is:  Number of seedlings = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds = 32 seeds / 8 flower beds = 4 seeds per flower bed. Therefore, if they put the same number of seeds in each flower bed, then the answer is 4 seeds per flower bed.
Response:  If Mathew had 5 creamers and gave 2 to each of his 11 friends, then he would have given away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 creamers. So, Mathew has 5 - 22 = -17 creamers left with him.
Response:  Matthews had 8 creekers to share with his friends. If he gave 2 creekers to each of his 4 friends, then how many creekers did each friend get? So, the answer is 4 creekers per friend.
Response:  If Mathew had 15 creekers and gave an equal number to his 5 friends, then he would have given away 3 creekers (since 15 / 5 = 3). So now Mathew has 12 creekers left ( since 15 - 3 = 12). Now each of Mathew's 5 friends has 3 creekers ( since 3 x 5 = 15), so together they have 15 creekers ( since 15 + 15 = 30). Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  If Mathew had 24 creekers and gave an equal number to his three friends, then he would have given away 8 creekers (since 3 x 8 = 24). So, now Mathew has 16 creekers left ( since 16 + 8 = 24). Now, if he gives 5 creekers to each of his other two friends, he will give away 10 creekers in total (since 2 x 10 = 20). So, now Mathew has 6 creekers left (since 16 - 10 = 6). Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Mathew had 22 creamers and 34 torte, then he gave an equal amount of creamers to his 11 friends. So, if each friend got x creamers, then the total number of creamers given away is 22x. Also, since each friend got y torte, the total number of torte eaten is 34y. Now we can set up the equation: 22x = 34y. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. Therefore, Mathew gave each of his 11 friends 15 creamers.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mathew had 29 creamers and 30 torts. If he gave an equal amount of creamers to his friends as many torte they consumed, then... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. Firstly, we know that Mathew had 29 creamers and 30 torts. If he gave an equal amount of creamers to his friends as many torte they consumed, then the number of creamers given to each friend would be proportional to the number of torte they consumed.

Let X be the number of torte consumed by each friend. Since Mathew gave an equal amount of creamers to each friend, the number of creamers given to each friend is also proportional to the number of torte they consumed. Therefore, the total number of creamers given away is equal to the product of the number of friends and the number of torte consumed by each friend:

Total number of creamers = Number of friends x Number of torte consumed per friend
= 5 x 4
= 20

So, Mathew gave away 20 creamers in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mathew had 14 creamers and 21 tarts. So, he distributed an equal number of creamers and tarts among his seven friends. Therefore, each friend received $\frac{14}{7} = 2$ creamers and $\frac{21}{7} = 3$ tarts.
Response:  If Matju has given an equal amount of cream to his 18 friends, then he must have had 18 x = 320 cream in total (since each friend got an equal amount). Therefore, each person would have received = 320 / 18 = 17.78 cream. So, the answer is 18.
Response:  If Matju has given 6 creekers to each of his friends, then he has given in total 6 x 5 = 30 creekers. So, if he had 36 creekers initially, then he must have had 36 - 30 = 6 creekers left after giving them away. Therefore, Matju has 6 creekers left for himself.
Response:  We know that Matju had 23 creekers initially and gave an equal amount to his friends. So, the number of creekers he gave away is also 23. Now, we need to find out how many creekers each friend got. Since there are 11 friends, each friend got 23/11 = 2 creekers. Therefore, each friend pooled 2 creekers.
Response:  If Mathew had 31 creekers and gave an equal number to his 5 friends, then he gave away 6 crekers (31 / 5 = 6). So, Mathew has 25 crekers left (31 - 6 = 25).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mathew gave an equal amount of cream to each of his four friends. So, if he had given x creamers to one friend, then he would have given 4x creamers to all four friends together.  Now, let's consider the number of torte pieces given to each friend. Since there are 98 torte pieces in total and Mathew gave them equally among his four friends, each friend received 24 torte pieces (98/4 = 24).  Therefore, the value of x is 24. So, Mathew gave 24 creamers to each of his four friends.
Response:  If Matju had 10 creamers and gave an equal amount to each of his four friends, then he gave away 10/4 = 2.5 creamers.  Since there were also 8 cakes, each friend got 2.5 / 8 = 0.3125 cakes. So, each friend ate 0.3125 cake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matju has given an equal amount of cream and cake to his 28 friends. So, if he gave x cream and y cakes, then the total number of pieces of cream and cake is 28x + 28y. Since there are 13 cream and 15 cakes in total, we can write the equation: 28x + 28y = 13 + 15 = 28. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 7 and y = 4. Therefore, each person ate 7 cream and 4 cakes.
Response:  Debi bought several bottles of water when they were on sale and drank 109 bottles per day. If she had bought x bottles, then after 74 days, she would have drunk x x 74 = total amount of water consumed. So, if Debi bought 5 bottles, she would have drunk 5 x 74 = 370 bottles of water in total.
Response:  Debi bought 153 bottles of water when they were half-empty. She drank the same number of bottles each day. If she drank from these bottles for 17 days, then...
Response:  Debi bought 264 bottles of water when they were on sale and used them for 11 days at a rate of 15 bottles per day. To find out how many bottles she has left, we can use the formula: Number of bottles remaining = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles used x Number of days used So, in this case: Number of bottles remaining = 264 - (15 x 11) = 264 - 165 = 99 bottles Therefore, Debi has 99 bottles of water left.
Response:  Debi bought 301 bottles of water when they were on sale and drank 144 bottles per day for several days. If she has left 157 bottles, how many days did she drink water?  Solution: We can start by using the information that Debi drank 144 bottles per day for several days. Since she had 301 bottles initially, she must have drunk 144 x number of days = 301 - 157 = 144 bottles in total. Therefore, the number of days she drank water is 157 / 144 = 1.
Response:  We know that Debi bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of salt when they were half empty. So, if she drank 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of salt per day, how many days would it take for her to finish all the bottles?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of bottles (91) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (95). Therefore, the answer is 91 / 95 = 96 days.
"Response:  If Debi bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they were on sale, that means she bought a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  Since she drank 312 bottles of water per day, we can calculate how many days it would take her to finish all the bottles of soda as follows:

Days taken to finish soda = Total number of bottles of soda / Number of bottles drunk per day
= 256 / 312
= 0.8 or approximately 1 month
Therefore, if Debi drank 312 bottles of water per day, it would take her around one month (approximately 30 days) to finish all the bottles of soda."
Response:  Debi drinks 6 bottles of water per day. If she buys an total of 12 bottles of water, how many days will it last her? We can calculate this as follows: Number of bottles = Total number of bottles / Amount drunk per day = 12 bottles / 6 bottles/day = 2 days So, Debi would be able to use the 12 bottles of water for 2 days.
Response:  We know that Debi bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water when they were on sale. If she drank 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day for how many days would the bottles last?  To solve this problem we need to divide the total number of bottles Debi had with the number of bottles she consumed per day. So, if Debi had 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water, and she consumed 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, it means that her supply of water will last for: Number of bottles of water = Total number of bottles - Daily consumption of water  Number of bottles of water = 180 - 15 = 165 days Now, let's find out how long Debi's supply of soda will last: Number of bottles of soda = Total number of bottles - Daily consumption of soda  Number of bottles of soda = 95 - 54 = 41 days Therefore, Debi's supply of both water and soda will last for 165 days (water) and 41 days (soda).
"Response:  If Debi bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale, and she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, then we can calculate how many days the soda lasted as follows:

Total amount of soda = 360 bottles x 122 bottles/day = 43,440 milliliters (mL)
Total amount of water = 162 bottles x 9 bottles/day = 1,458 mL
Debi drank a total of 43,440 + 1,458 = 44,898 mL of liquid per day.
Since each bottle contains 337 mL of liquid, Debi would have consumed 44,898 / 337 = 134.5 bottles of soda per day.
Therefore, if Debi drank 9 bottles of soda per day, it would take her approximately 134.5 / 9 = 15 days for one bottle to last."

= 341 + 54
= 395
So, there are 395 pencils in total."
Response:  If Faika has put 30 erasers in rows with 5 erasers in each row, then she must have made...  Number of rows = Total number of erasers / Number of erasers in each row = 30 / 5 = 6 rows. Therefore, Faika was able to make 6 rows of erasers.
Response:  If Faith has placed 6 pencils in each row, then she must have placed 12 pencils in total (6 x 2 = 12). Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  If Faith had 35 packages of pencils and each package contained 4 pencils, then she had a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pencils. Now, if she put her pencils in rows with two pencils in each row, she could make 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, there were 70 rows that Faith could have made.
Response:  We know that Faith had 31 packs of pencils and each pack contains 6 pencils. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Now, we are told that she placed her pencils in rows with 19 pencils in each row. Therefore, the number of rows she made is 186 / 19 = 9 rows. So, Faith has 9 rows of pencils.
Response:  Faia has placed her pencils in 30 rows with 71 pencils and 24 pencils in each row. Therefore, we need to calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row Total number of pencils = 30 x 24 = 720 olsik. So, there are 720 pencils in total.
"Response:  If Faia has placed her pencils in 16 rows with 6 pencils each row and 21 pencils in each row, then we have:

Number of rows = Number of pencils / Number of pencils per row = 16

Therefore, there are 96 pencils in total."
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in the school and 7 school buses. Since each bus can carry a certain number of passengers, we need to find out how many passengers each bus can hold.  If all 7 buses are full, then the total number of passengers they can carry is equal to the number of students in the school divided by the number of buses. So, if we divide 98 by 7, we get:  Number of passengers per bus = 98 / 7 = 14 places per bus. Therefore, there are 14 places in each of the 7 school buses.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each school bus can accommodate 118 students. Therefore, we need to divide the number of classrooms (84) by the capacity of each school bus (118). So, the total number of students in the school is:

Number of students = Number of classrooms / Capacity of each school bus
= 84 / 118
= 706
Therefore, there are approximately 706 students in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in the school and each class has 66 students, so we have:

Number of classes = 67
Number of students per class = 66
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 67 x 66 = 4232
Now, let's find out how many buses are needed to transport all these students:
We know that each bus can carry 6 passengers, so we need:

Number of buses required = Total number of students / Capacity of one bus = 4232 / 6 = 705 buses
Therefore, the answer is 705 buses."
Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in the school and each class has an equal number of students (58). Therefore, we can assume that all classes have the same number of students, which is denoted as n. Since there are 2 seats per bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to determine how many buses are needed for transportation: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus = 87n / 2 = n + 43. So, we need at least 43 buses to transport all the students from the school.

Solution:
Let's think step by step.
We know that there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, we can assume that there are 120/24 = 5 students in each class.
So, there are 5 x 24 = 120 students in each grade level."
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and 8 places available per bus. So, we need to divide the number of students by the number of places available per bus to find out how many buses are needed: Number of students = 102 Students per bus = 8 Therefore, we need: Number of buses = Number of students / Students per bus = 102 / 8 = 13 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students who do not want to go on the trip. So, we have 102 - 11 = 91 classrooms left for the remaining students. Since each bus can accommodate up to 99 students, we have 91 / 99 = 0.92 or approximately 92 students per bus. Therefore, if 8 students do not want to go on the trip, then approximately 92 - 8 = 84 students will go on the trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students (as stated in the problem). Therefore, we have:
Number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class
= 72 x 3
= 216 students
Now, we also know that there are 3 buses available for transporting students to the excursion site. So, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses to find out how many students each bus can accommodate:
Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 216 / 3
= 72 students per bus
Therefore, if the school needs 3 buses to transport all 216 students to the excursion site, then the school will need 3 x 72 = 216 students per bus."
Response:  We know that there are 92 students in total and 46 school buses. Since each bus can carry a certain number of students, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses to find out how many students each bus can hold.  Therefore, the capacity of each school bus is: Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of school buses = 92 / 46 = 2 Students per bus So, if all the school buses are full, then there will be 2 students in each bus.
Response:  If there are 11 boys in Haylie's class and they like to play marbles, then each boy has 9 marbles (since the question states that Haylie gives them as many marbles as they had). So, the total number of marbles given is:  Number of boys x Number of marbles per boy = 11 x 9 = 99 marbles.
Response:  If there are 5 boys and each boy has received 5 marbles, then the total number of marbles given to the boys is 5 x 5 = 25.  Therefore, the remaining 7 marbles (10 - 25) are left with Haylie.
Response:  If Haylie has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she will have 9 marbles left after giving some away.  Since there are 4 boys playing, each boy will get 9/4 = 2 marbles from Haylie. Therefore, the number of marbles the boys will get is 2 x 4 = 8 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like to play marbles and 50 boys who like to play cards, then the total number of boys is 63 (13 + 50). Now, if Hayley has 26 marbles, she will give each boy 26/63 = 4 marbles.
"Response: 1) Healy has 20 marbles and wants to share them equally among the boys in the second grade. 2) There are X boys in the second grade who want to play with Healy's marbles. 3) We need to find out how many marbles each boy will get if we divide them equally. So, we can write an equation: Number of marbles = Total number of marbles / Number of boys. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of marbles = 20 / X. Since X is unknown, we cannot solve for Number of marbles yet. However, we know that X is a positive integer (a whole number) because there are only whole numbers of boys in the second grade who want to play with Healy's marbles. Therefore, we can assume that X is at least 1. Now, let's try to find X by using the information provided in the question. According to the question, ""deca"
Response:  According to the problem statement, Heather gave each boy two pebbles (топчица). If there were 28 marbles in total and she gave them out equally among the boys, then the number of marbles each boy received is equal to the number of boys divided by the total number of marbles. So if there are x boys, and Heather has y marbles, then each boy got x/y marbles. In this case, since there are 7 boys, we can set up the equation: x = 7 and y = 28. Solving for x, we get that Heather gave each boy 4 marbles (x = 7 / 28). Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Frank read his favorite book for x days. Since he reads 14 pages per day, the number of pages he has read is given by x \* 14 = 392 (since there are 392 pages in total). Therefore, we can set up the equation: x = 392 / 14 = 27.5 days. So, Frank will need to finish reading the book in approximately 27.5 days.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days / Number of pages per day Total number of days = 569 days Number of pages per day = 22 pages/day Now, let's substitute these values into the equation to get the total number of pages in the book: Number of pages = 569 days / 22 pages/day = 25,714 pages So, there are approximately 25,714 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 6 days and it had 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can use the following formula: Number of pages read = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book In this case, the total number of pages is 612, and the number of days taken to finish the book is 6. So, if we plug these values into the formula, we get: Number of pages read = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book and it had 555 pages, evenly distributed in 5 chapters. To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 555 / 5 = 111 pages per chapter. Therefore, there were 111 pages in each chapter.
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 660 days and it had 193 pages distributed evenly across 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of days he spent reading the book (660) by the total number of chapters (15):

$$ \text{Chapters per day} = \frac{\text{Total days}}{\text{Number of chapters}} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Chapters per day} = \frac{660}{\ 15}} = 44\text{ chapters per day} } $$
Therefore, Frank read 44 chapters per day."
"Response:  We know that Frank read some books and each book had 249 pages. So, if he reads one book per day, then he will finish all the books in 3 days (since there are 3 days). Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:
Pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days
= 249 pages/book x 3 days
= 747 pages
So, Frank read 747 pages per day."
"Response:  If Frank read x books and each book has y pages, then he will take z days to finish reading all the books, where:
x = number of books
y = number of pages in each book
z = total number of days taken to finish reading all the books
We are given that Frank took 12 days to finish each book, so we can write an equation based on this information:
z = 12 (since Frank took 12 days to finish each book)
Now, we are also given that Frank read 66 pages per book, so we can substitute this value into our previous equation:
z = 12 (from above)
66 = y (per page)
Now, we need to find out how many books Frank read in total. We know that it took him 492 days to finish reading all the books, so we can write another equation:
z = 492 (from above)
x = number of books
Substituting the values we have found so far into these equations, we get:
x = 66
y = 66
z = 492
Therefore, Frank read 66 books, each with 66 pages, and it took him 492 days to finish reading all the books."
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 16 days and the book had 112 pages. So, we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days."
"Response:  Frank read 8 pages per day, so he finished reading the book in:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{ \text{Number of pages read per day}} $$

Given that Frank read 8 pages per day and the book had 576 pages, we can calculate the number of days it took him to finish reading the book as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of pages} &= 576 \\ \text{Number of pages read per day} &= 8 \\ \text{Number of days} &= \frac{576}{8} = 72 \end{aligned} $$
Therefore, Frank took 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 30 days and each day he read 450 pages. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book
= 41 x 450 / 30
= 275 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read 275 pages every day during those 30 days."
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book and it had three chapters with 594 pages each. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, if there are 3 chapters with 594 pages each, then the total number of pages in the book is: Total pages = 3 x 594 = 1782 pages Now, we are asked how many days Frank took to finish reading the book. According to the question, he took 607 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, we can calculate the rate at which Frank read the book as follows: Reading speed = Total pages / Time taken to finish reading the book So, if Frank took 607 days to finish reading the book, and the total number of pages in the book is 1782 pages, then the rate at which Frank read the book is: Reading speed = 1782 pages / 607 days = 2.9 pages per day
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 664 days and it had 2 chapters with 405 pages each. Therefore, he read 810 pages per day (2 x 405 = 810).
"Response:  If we have 6 packages of DVDS that can be bought for $120, then each package costs:
$120 / 6 = $20 per package
Therefore, each package costs $20."
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then the cost of 33 packages would be:
$81 x 33 = $2693."
Response:  If each DVD case costs $107, then buying one case will cost exactly that amount: $107.  Now, if we want to buy x cases of DVDs with a discount of $93 per case, we can calculate the total cost as follows:  Total Cost = Number of Cases x Discount Price = x x $93 = $x So, to find out how many cases of DVDs we can buy with $93, we need to divide the total cost by the discount price: $x / $93 = x Therefore, the answer is x = 12.
Response:  If each DVD case costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then we need to calculate how much one package costs after applying the discount. So, let's divide $76 by $25 to find out the cost of one package: $$ \frac {76} {25} = 3 } Therefore, each package costs $3 after applying the discount.
"Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many DVDs you can buy with your money.
$104 / $26 = 4 DVDs
So, you can buy 4 DVDs with $104."
Response:  If $28 can buy 2 packages of DVDS, then each package costs half of that amount or $14 per package.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in Philip's collection. If we organize them into groups of size 2, then we can divide them into how many groups?  To find out, let's use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a quotient and remainder. In this case, we want to divide 18 by 2 to see how many groups we can make.  So, 18 divided by 2 equals... (wait for it)...9! That means we can make 9 groups of 2 bananas each.  Therefore, if we organize Philip's banana collection into groups of size 2, he has 9 groups of bananas.
"Response:  We know that Filip has 140 groups of bananas and each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas in Filip's collection is:

140 x 187 = 23,600

So, there are 23,600 bananas in Filip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 portocales in Philip's collection. If we organize the bananas into groups of 7, then each group will contain 28 bananas (203 / 7 = 28). Therefore, there will be 28 groups of bananas. Now, if we organize the portocales into groups of 95, then each group will contain 7 portocales (63 / 95 = 7). So, there will be 7 groups of portocales.  Therefore, the answer is:  Number of groups of bananas = 28 Number of groups of portocales = 7
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 portocals in Philip's collection. If we organize the bananas into groups of 47, then each group will contain 142/47 = 29 bananas. Similarly, if we organize the portocals into groups of 178, then each group will contain 356/178 = 20 portocals. Therefore, each group of portocals is large.
Response:  We know that there are 392 bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into 196 groups of bananas. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bananas in each group as follows: Number of bananas in each group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2 So, each group contains 2 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in Filipova's collection and we want to group them into smaller groups of size 18. So, we can start by dividing all 18 bananas equally among 18 groups of one banana each. Therefore, there is only one group with 18 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are organized into two groups of unknown size. For each group of bananas, we have 87 portocals. So, if we divide the number of bananas by the number of groups, we get: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group = 290 / (2 x # of groups) = 145 Since there are 93 groups of portocals, we can conclude that each group of bananas contains 145/93 = 15 bananas. Therefore, the size of each group of bananas is 15 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 portocales and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we organize the bananas into groups of 345, then each group will have 345/345 = 1 banana. Therefore, each group of portocales has 16 / 345 = 0.046 grou...
Response:  If Breda has prepared 38 colachicks for guests and each of them contains 19 colachicks for how many guests she has prepared colachicks? So, we have to multiply 38 with 19 to get the total number of colachicks prepared by Breda: 38 x 19 = 702 colachicks. Therefore, the correct answer is 702.
Response:  If Breda made 14 colachicks for 14 people and each person had 30 colachicks, then we can calculate how many colachicks Breda prepared as follows: Number of colachicks = Total number of people x Number of colachicks per person  Number of colachicks = 14 x 30  Number of colachicks = 420 colachicks So, Breda prepared 420 colachicks.
Response:  We know that:  - The mother made 22 colachicks for 5 people.  - She had to throw away 17 of them. So we have: Number of colachicks = 22 - Number of colachicks thrown away = 17 Now, let's assume each person got an equal number of colachicks. Therefore, the number of colachicks per person is: Number of colachicks per person = Total number of colachicks / Number of people = 22 - 17 / 5 = 5 colachicks per person.
Response:  Mother made 10 colačići for 10 guests, but 9 guests did not come. So she prepared 18 colačići in total. Each guest had an equal number of colačići as there were guests. Therefore, each guest had 2 colačići (since there were 10 guests).
Response:  Mother made 14 cookies for two guests. If each guest had an equal number of cookies as the other guest, then the number of cookies each guest received is half of 14. Therefore, each guest received 7 cookies (half of 14).
Response:  If Breda made 10 colachicks for guests and each guest had 2 colachicks, then she prepared a total of 20 colachicks (10 x 2).
Response:  Frank had 42 pieces of candy. If he puts them in equal boxes, then each box will contain 42/n pieces of candy, where n is the number of boxes. So we need to find out how many boxes Frank has. Let's assume that Frank has n boxes. Then, the total number of pieces of candy in all the boxes is given by 42 × n = Total number of pieces of candy. Since there are no restrictions on the value of n, we can take any positive integer value for n. For example, if n = 5, then each box contains 42/5 = 8 pieces of candy. Similarly, if n = 10, then each box contains 42/10 = 4 pieces of candy. In general, if n is any positive integer, then each box contains 42/n pieces of candy.
Response:  Frank had 26 sweets in total. If he puts them into 26 boxes with 33 pieces of candy in each box, then we can calculate the number of sweets per box as follows: Number of sweets = Total number of sweets / Number of boxes = 26 / 26 = 1 So, there are 1 sweets in each box.
Response:  Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them. So he has 9 remaining pieces of candy. If we divide these 9 pieces equally among 3 bags ( each bag can hold 9/3 = 3 pieces of candy), then each bag will have 3 pieces of candy. Therefore, there will be 3 bags with 3 pieces of candy in each bag.
Response:  If Frank has put 11 pieces of candy in each bag and he has 22 bags in total, then the number of candies he has is: Number of bags x Number of candies per bag = 22 x 11 = 242 candies. Therefore, the answer is 242.
"Response:  Frank has put parachutes in two bags. If he had 16 pieces of candy altogether, and each bag can hold 4 pieces of candy, then...

Answer: There are 2 bags, so together they can hold 8 pieces of candy (4 x 2 = 8). Since Frank has 16 pieces of candy in total, that means there are 8 - 16 = -8 pieces of candy left over. So, Frank has 0 pieces of candy in each bag."
"Response:  If Shirley sold 25 cups of trifle, and each cup contains 14 spoonfuls, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of spoonfuls in all 25 cups.
Spoonfuls = Number of cups x Number of spoonfuls per cup
= 25 x 14
= 350 spoonfuls

So, Shirley needs to deliver 350 spoonfuls of trifle."
"Response:  If Shirley sold 10 boxes of truffles and each box contains 5 pieces, then...

Answer: There are 10 boxes of truffles, so there are 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of truffles in total."
"Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation:

Regular soda = 67
Diet soda = 9

Now, let's compare these two quantities to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda:

More regular soda = Regular soda - Diet soda
= 67 - 9
= 58

So, there were 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
"Response:  We know that there were 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Regular soda = x
Diet soda = 61 - x

Now, we are asked to find out how many more bottles of diet soda there were than regular soda. To do this, we need to subtract the number of regular soda from the total number of bottles of soda:

Number of bottles of diet soda minus Number of bottles of regular soda = 61 - 22 = 39

So, there were 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda."
"Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda. So, in total, we have:

30 + 8 = 38

Now, let's add the number of apples to this total:

38 + 41 = 79

Therefore, the total number of bottles at the store was 79."
Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of ordinary soda and 53 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation:  Ordinary soda = 79 - Diet soda = 53 To solve for the number of bottles of ordinary soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of soda. Therefore, the answer is: Number of bottles of ordinary soda = 79 - 53 = 26
"Response:  We know that there were 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda in total. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Total number of bottles = Number of diet soda bottles + Number of regular soda bottles

Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get:

Total number of bottles = 54 + 83

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Total number of bottles = 137

Now, let's find out how many more regular soda bottles there were than diet soda bottles:

Number of regular soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles
= 83 - 54
= 29

So, there were 29 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles."
Response:  We know that there were 17 bags in total and 9 of them were regular carbonated drinks. So, the number of dietary gas-free drinks is 17 - 9 = 8. Since they also had 29 apples, we can conclude that each bag contained 29 / 8 = 4 apples. Therefore, the number of dietary gas-free drinks was 8.
"Response:  We know that there were 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of diet soda bottles + Number of regular soda bottles

Total number of bottles = 19 + 60

Total number of bottles = 79

Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda:

Number of regular soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles
= 60 - 19
= 41

So, there were 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
Response:  We know that there are more than 78 jabukas because we were told that there are 72 bottles of ordinary soda and 32 bottles of diet soda. So, if we subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles, we get: Total number of bottles = 72 + 32 - 78 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more bottles than jabukas.
Response:  We know that there are 36 jabokas and 80 bags of ordinary salt. Therefore, we have: Number of bags of ordinary salt = 80/1 = 80 bags. Now, let's find out how many more bags of dietetic soda than jabokas: Number of bags of dietetic soda = 54 - 36 = 18 bags. So, there are 18 more bags of dietetic soda than jabokas.
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were regular soda bottles. So, the number of dietary gas-free drinks bottles is:  Number of dietary gas-free drinks = Total number of bottles - Number of regular soda bottles  Number of dietary gas-free drinks = 30 - 28  Number of dietary gas-free drinks = 2  Therefore, there were 2 bottles of dietary gas-free drinks in the store.
Response:  If there were 4 dietary sodas and they had more than 79 bottles of regular soda, then we can calculate how many bottles of regular soda they had based on the ratio of dietary to regular soda. So let's assume that for every 1 bottle of dietary soda, there are x bottles of regular soda. Then we know that the total number of bottles of both types of soda is equal to 4 + x = 79. Solving for x, we get x = 75. Therefore, the prosecutor had 75 bottles of regular soda.
Response:  We know that there were 57 boards of common salt, and each board contains 10 kg of salt. Therefore, the total weight of common salt is: 57 x 10 = 570 kg.  Next, we know that there were 26 boards of dietary salt, and each board contains 5 kg of salt. Therefore, the total weight of dietary salt is: 26 x 5 = 130 kg. Finally, we know that there were 27 boards of lye salt, and each board contains 10 kg of salt. Therefore, the total weight of lye salt is: 27 x 10 = 270 kg. So, in total, there are 570 + 130 + 270 = 970 kg of salt at the store.
"Response:  We know that there were 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation: 

Number of regular sodas = 81
Number of diet sodas = 60

Now, let's find out how many more regular sodas than diet sodas are: 

More regular sodas than diet sodas = Number of regular sodas - Number of diet sodas
= 81 - 60
= 21

So, there were 21 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of ordinary soda and 40 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of bottles = Number of ordinary soda + Number of diet soda  Total number of bottles = 49 + 40  Total number of bottles = 89  Therefore, there were 89 bottles of both ordinary and diet soda in total.
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 317 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If there were more visitors than the previous day, we can write an inequality based on this information: 317 > x (where x is the number of visitors the previous day) Since we are told that there were 295 visitors the previous day, we can substitute this value into our inequality: 317 > 295 This inequality simplifies to: 28 = 16 So, there were 16 more visitors to Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day.
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 703 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace the day before. If there were 246 visitors per day for 25 days, how many visitors would have come to Buckingham Palace in total?  To find this number, we can multiply the number of visitors per day by the number of days:  Total visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days  Total visitors = 246 visitors/day x 25 days  Total visitors = 6,150 visitors  Therefore, according to the information provided in the question, 6,150 visitors came to Buckingham Palace in 25 days.
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 100 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace before that day. If there were more visitors than that at the palace that day, how many more? So let's assume that there were x more visitors than the previous day. Then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of visitors yesterday = 100 + x Number of visitors today =? To solve for number of visitors today, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the total number of visitors today: Number of visitors today = Total number of visitors - (Number of visitors yesterday) Now we are given that the total number of visitors today is 666, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Number of visitors today = 666 - (100 + x) Solving for x, we get: x = 566 Therefore, there were 566 more visitors at Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day.
Response:  We know that there were 406 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days. And we also know that after their delicious lunch, they went to see the palace. So, the number of visitors who visited the palace today is equal to the total number of visitors minus the number of visitors who went to see the palace after lunch. Therefore, the number of visitors who visited the palace today is:  Number of visitors = Total visitors - Visitors who saw the palace after lunch  Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors:  Total visitors = 406 (visitors in the past 327 days)  And now, let's calculate the number of visitors who went to see the palace after lunch:  Visitors who saw the palace after lunch = 132 (number of visitors who came to see the palace today)  Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:  Number of visitors = Total visitors - Visitors who saw the palace after lunch  Number of visitors = 406 - 132  Number of visitors = 274  Therefore, there were 274 visitors to Buckingham Palace today.
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 45 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace before that day. If 829 people visited Buckingham Palace in the past 85 days, how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace on that particular day?  To find this out, we can divide the total number of visitors by the number of days since the last visit:  Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days since last visit = 829 / 85 = 10 visitors per day So, on that particular day, 10 visitors came to Buckingham Palace.
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast, they went to see Buckingham Palace. In Buckingham Palace, there were 71 paintings. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If there were 188 visitors before lunchtime, how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace in 57 days?  To find out, we can use the following formula: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days  So, if there were 557 visitors in one day, and there are 57 days in total, we can calculate the number of visitors as follows: Number of visitors = 557 / 57 = 9 Visitors per day Now, let's check our answer with the information given in the question: According to the question, 188 people visited Buckingham Palace before lunchtime. Since there are 57 days in total, we can calculate the number of visitors as follows: Number of visitors = 188 x 57 = 10,636 visitors Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, there were approximately 10,636 visitors to Buckingham Palace in 57 days.
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There were 39 pictures in Buckingham Palace. Rachel found out that 661 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If there were more visitors than the previous day, how many more? So we can write an equation as follows: Number of visitors today = Number of visitors yesterday + Increase from previous day (Δ) Where Δ is the increase from the previous day. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of visitors today = 661 + Δ Number of visitors yesterday = 600 Now, let's solve for Δ: Δ = Number of visitors today - Number of visitors yesterday Δ = 661 - 600 Δ = 61 Therefore, there were 61 more visitors than the previous day.
"Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 92 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If there were 419 visitors before dawn and 103 more than the number of visitors who came to Buckingham Palace that day, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of visitors = 419 + (Number of visitors to Buckingham Palace - 103) So, if we substitute the value given in the problem for ""Number of visitors to Buckingham Palace,"" which is 92, we get: Number of visitors = 419 + (92 - 103) = 419 + (-11) = 408 Therefore, there were 408 visitors before dawn."
Response:  We know that after a delicious breakfast, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 512 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If there were 471 visitors before dawn and 808 visitors in total over the past 89 days, we can calculate their number as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days  Number of visitors = 512 + (471 x 89) / 2 = 512 + (36,619 / 2) = 37,238 Therefore, there were 37,238 visitors to Buckingham Palace in total over the past 89 days.
Response:  We know that there were more visitors to Buckingham Palace than in previous days because Reese learned that 705 visitors came that day. So let's assume that the number of visitors per day before that was x. Then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of visitors per day = x + 191 (since there were 191 more visitors than usual) Number of visitors per day = x + 457 ( since there were 457 more visitors than usual) Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for x, we get: x = 163 (the number of visitors per day before that) And so, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace that day was: Total number of visitors = x + 191 + 457 = 611 visitors.
Response:  We know that Vasilij has already applied 104 grams of wax to his list and he needs another 159 grams to attach the feathers together. So, in total, Vasilij needs 263 grams of wax (159 + 104). Now, we need to find out how much wax is left after attaching the feathers. To do this, we can subtract the amount of wax needed for attaching the feathers from the total amount of wax required: 263 - 159 = 104 grams. Therefore, Vasilij still needs 104 grams of wax to complete his task.
"Response:  We know that Vasilij has already used 260 grams of wax to varnish his feathers and he needs an additional 49 grams for painting them. So, if per each feather he uses 1/5 grams of wax (since he has 49 grams in total), then he will need:

$$ \text {Number of feathers} = \frac{\text{Total amount of wax needed}}{\text{Amount of wax needed per feather}} $$

We are given that Vasilij needs a total of 49 grams of wax for painting all of his feathers. Therefore, we can plug this value into the equation above:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of feathers}} = \frac{49\text{ grams}}{1/5\text{ gram per feather}} = 98\text{ feathers} $$

So, Vasilij has 98 feathers."
Response:  We know that Vasilij needs 57 grams of paint to color his feathers and 22 grams of glue to stick them together. So far, he has used a total of 57 + 22 = 79 grams of materials. The question asks how much more glue he needs, so we can calculate this as follows: Total amount of glue needed = Amount already used x Percentage of feathers that require glue / 100 To find out how much of each feather requires glue, let's assume that each feather requires an average of 20% of its weight in glue (this is just an estimate, since we don't have any information about the actual proportion of feathers that need glue). Therefore, if one feather weighs 353 grams, it will require 353 x 20/100 = 70.6 grams of glue on average. Now, let's check how many feathers Vasilij has: Number of feathers = Total amount of material used / Amount of material required per feather Since Vasilij has already used 79 grams of materials, and each feather requires an average of 70.6 grams of glue, the number of feathers he has is: Number of feathers = 79 / 70.6 = 10.8 feathers In other words, Vasilij has approximately 11 feathers worth of glue left over after coloring his feathers.
Response:  We know that peregrine needs 166 grams of wax to stick feathers together.  If he has only 20 grams left, then he still needs 146 grams more (166 - 20 = 146).
Response:  We know that Vasilij has 557 grams of wax and he needs only 17 grams more to stick all the feathers together. So, we can calculate how much wax is needed per feather as follows: Number of feathers = Total amount of wax / Amount of wax needed per feather = 557 g / 0.17 g/feather = 3268 feathers Now, since there are 557 grams of wax in total, and each feather requires 0.17 grams of wax, then the number of feathers that can be stuck together with the given amount of wax is: Number of feathers = Total amount of wax / Amount of wax needed per feather = 557 g / 0.17 g/feather = 3268 feathers Therefore, if Vasilij has 557 grams of wax and he needs only 17 grams more to stick all the feathers together, then he will be able to stick approximately 3268 feathers together using the remaining amount of wax.
"Response:  We know that Vasilij has 11 grams of wax left and perches need 492 grams of wax in total. So, we can calculate how much more wax he needs as follows:

Quantity of wax needed = Total amount of wax required for perches - Amount of wax already available
= 492 grams - 11 grams
= 481 grams

Therefore, Vasilij still needs 481 grams of wax to complete his task."
Response:  If he has to fill 90 bottles of grape juice in 6 days, that means he needs to fill 15 bottles per day (90/6 = 15).
"Response:  If there are 266 voters and they need to fill 90 baskets of grapes in 5 days, we can calculate how many baskets each voter needs to fill per day as follows:

Number of voters = 266
Number of baskets needed = 90
Days left = 5

Now, let's divide the total number of baskets by the number of days left:

Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days left
= 90 / 5
= 18

So, each voter would need to fill 18 baskets of grapes per day."
Response:  If he has to fill 244 bottles of grape juice per day and he works for 146 days, then he will have filled 35,088 bottles (244 x 146 = 35,088).
"Response:  We know that there are 221 coppers of grapes to be paid daily and we have 77 days left for payment. So, total amount of grapes to be paid is:

$$ \text {Total number of coppers of grapes} = \text {Number of coppers of grapes per day} \times \text{ Number of days left for payment} $$

= $221 \times 77$

= $16,477$

So, there would be $\boxed {16,477}$ copper of grapes filled in 77 days."
Response:  If he checked the vineyard after 57 stops and found that 252 grapes had been filled into 108 bottles, then in 58 days, how many bottles would be filled with grapes?  We know that one day has 24 hours, so we can calculate the number of hours in 58 days as follows: 58 days x 24 hours/day = 1364 hours. Now, let's assume that each hour, he fills 1 bottle with grapes (this is just an assumption, but it will help us to solve the problem). Therefore, the total number of bottles filled with grapes in 58 days would be: 1364 hours / 1 bottle per hour = 1364 bottles. So, there would be 1364 bottles filled with grapes in 58 days.
"Response:  If he has saved 36 grapes for his last station and needs to fill 240 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many days it will take as follows:

Days = Number of grapes / Number of barrels needed
= 36 grapes / 240 barrels
= 1/6 or 16.67 days
Therefore, it will take approximately 16.67 days to fill 240 barrels of wine with 36 grapes saved for the last station."
Response:  We know that there were 26 aquariums for saltwater and each aquarium had an equal number of fish. So, if we multiply the number of aquariums by the number of fish in each aquarium, we get: Number of fish = 26 x 52 = 1320 fish. Therefore, there were 1320 fish in all the aquariums combined.
Response:  We know that there were 40 marine animals in total and each aquarium had 2 marine animals. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of marine animals / Number of marine animals per aquarium. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, there were 20 aquariums in total.
Response:  Since he has 56 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 39 animals, then the total number of marine animals is: 56 x 39 = 2174. Similarly, since he has 10 aquariums for freshwater animals and each aquarium contains 39 animals, then the total number of freshwater animals is: 10 x 39 = 390. Therefore, the total number of animals in all the aquariums is: 2174 + 390 = 2564. So, Taijer has approximately 2564 animals in his aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and each aquarium has 46 animals in it. So, the total number of freshwater animals is:  74 x 46 = 3308. Now, we also know that there are 22 aquariums for saltwater animals, and each aquarium has 46 animals in it too. Therefore, the total number of saltwater animals is:  22 x 46 = 952. So, the total number of animals in all the aquariums is:  3308 + 952 = 4260. Thus, Taijer has approximately 4260 animals in his aquariums.
Response:  For marine animals, there are 15 aquariums with 19 creatures in each = 285 creatures.  For freshwater animals, there are 62 aquariums with 19 creatures in each = 1140 creatures. In total, there are 285 + 1140 = 1425 creatures.
Response:  If we buy 13 white t-shirts in one package, then we will have 1 package. So, if Mom buys 39 white t-shirts, she will have 39 / 1 = 39 packages.
Response:  If Mama buys 66 white shirts and each package contains 3 white shirts, then we need to divide 66 by 3 to find out how many packages she will buy. So, the answer is 22 packages.
Response:  If we have 28 packages of white shirts and each package contains 56 white shirts in total, then we can calculate the number of white shirts per package as follows: Number of white shirts per package = Total number of white shirts / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2 So, there are 2 white shirts in each package.
Response:  If we buy 53 packages of white shirts, then we will have 53 x 5 = 265 white shirts in total. Now, if we add the number of pants (34) to this total, we get 265 + 34 = 299 pieces of clothing in total. Therefore, there will be 299 white shirts and 34 pants.
Response:  Mamа buys 51 white shirts. If they can be bought in packages of 3 packs each, then how many packages will she have? We know that 51 / 3 = 17 packages. Therefore, Mamá will have 17 packages.
Response:  If Mama buys 70 white shirts in total and each package contains x white shirts, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of packages = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per package = 70 / x = x packages So, there are x packages of white shirts that Mama bought. Since Mama buys 14 packs, we can set up another equation:  Number of packs = Number of white shirts / Number of shirts per pack = 70 / x = 14 packets Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and x). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the value of x: x = 5 So, there are 5 packages of white shirts that Mama bought.
Response:  If there are 4 torbes with an equal number of cookies in each torbe, then the total number of cookies in all 4 torbes is 36 / 4 = 9. So, each torbe has 9 cookies.
Response:  We have 33 co...
Response:  If each bag has 41 cookies and you have 53 bags of cookies, then the total number of cookies is:  Total number of cookies = Number of bags x Number of cookies per bag  Total number of cookies = 53 x 41  Total number of cookies = 2193 cookies.
Response:  We have 14 colaachicks in total and 7 baskets with the same number of colaachicks as each basket has. So, we need to divide 14 by 7 to find out how many colaachicks are in each basket. Therefore, there are 2 colaachicks in each basket.
Response:  If each bag has 3 cookies and you have 21 total cookies, then: Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag  Number of bags = 21 / 3  Number of bags = 7 So, you have 7 bags of cookies.
Response:  We know that there were 26 bags with the same number of cookies. If we have 15 bonbons and 52 cookies in total, then each bag had 52 / 26 = 2 cookies per bag. Therefore, we have 2 x 26 = 52 bags of cookies.
Response:  We know that initially, there were 14 bags with an equal number of cookies. So, if we had x bags of cookies initially, then the total number of cookies in all bags is 14x. Now, we have received 28 additional cookies and 86 more sweets for a total of 114 items. Therefore, the number of bags of cookies we now have is (114 - 14x) / 14 = 90/14 = 6.43 bags of cookies. Since we cannot have a fraction of a bag, we must round up to 7 bags of cookies. Thus, you have 7 bags of cookies.
Response:  Posta has to deliver 5 spam emails in each block. Since there are 25 houses in each block, Posta will have to deliver 5 x 25 = 125 spam emails in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 125.
Response:  Postal worker must deliver 9 spam emails to each house in every block. Since there are 20 houses in each block, we need to divide 9 by 20 to find out how many spam emails should be delivered to each house. So, the answer is 45 spam emails per block (9 / 20 = 45).
Response: 1. There are 6 houses in each block. So, there are 6 x 6 = 36 houses in total. 2. The postman needs to deliver 24 packages per day. Therefore, he will need to deliver 24 / 36 = 0.67 packages per house per day (or approximately 1 package every 1.5 days).
Response:  Postman gives 14 spam messages to each house in a block. If the postman needs to deliver two pieces of spam mail to every house in the block, then there are 28 houses in the block (14 x 2 = 28). Therefore, there are 28 houses in the block.
Response: 1. The total number of houses in the block is 20. 2. Each house needs to receive 32 pieces of mail. Therefore, the total number of pieces of mail that need to be delivered to each block is 32 x 20 = 640 pieces of mail. So, the postman needs to deliver 640 pieces of mail to each block.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many packages of unwanted mail there are in total. According to the question, there are 30 packages of unwanted mail that must be delivered to each of the 78 blocks. Therefore, the total number of unwanted packages is:

30 packages/block x 78 blocks = 2340 packages of unwanted mail
Now, let's calculate how many packages of unwanted mail should be given to each house. Since there are 19 houses per block, and each house receives 30 packages of unwanted mail, the number of packages of unwanted mail that should be given to each house is:

30 packages/house x 19 houses/block = 570 packages of unwanted mail per block
Therefore, the final answer is:

Total number of unwanted packages = 2340 packages
Number of packages of unwanted mail per house = 570 packages"
Response:  Postać must deliver 8 packages of spam per each of the 55 blocks. Since there are 55 blocks in total, he will have to deliver 8 x 55 = 440 packages of spam altogether.
Response:  Postac must deliver 4 spam messages to each of the 81 blocks. Since there are 12 houses in each block, Postac needs to deliver 4 x 12 = 48 spam messages per block. Therefore, the total number of spam messages that Postac must deliver is 81 x 48 = 3696.
Response:  Postac has to deliver 4 spam messages in each of the 16 blocks. Since there are 17 houses in each block, he needs an additional 17 x 4 = 68 spam messages. Therefore, the total number of unwanted letters that Posta must give is 68.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles. If she wants to divide them into groups of 4, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these resources. To do this, we will use division. Division is when we divide a number by another number to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 10 (the number of eggs) by 5 (the number of marbles per group). So, if we divide 10 by 5, we get 2. This means that Rebeka can create 2 groups of 4 marbles each using her 20 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 10 cups of jelly beans and 15 eggs to share among groups of 5 people each. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide the total number of jelly beans and eggs by 5. So, we will divide 10 + 15 = 25 by 5 = 5 groups. Therefore, Rebeka can create 5 groups with her jelly beans and eggs.
Response:  If Rebecca has a collection of eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 11, then she will have X eggs left after dividing them into 11 groups. Since each group contains 2 eggs, we can write an equation as follows: X = 2(11) = 22 eggs. Therefore, Rebeka has 22 eggs in total.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. She wants to divide them into 4 groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. To do this, we can use division. For example, if Rebeka has 8 eggs and she wants to divide them equally among 4 groups, then each group will get 2 eggs. Therefore, Group 1 will have 2 eggs, Group 2 will have 2 eggs, Group 3 will have 2 eggs, and Group 4 will have 2 eggs as well. Now let's count the number of marbles each group will have. Since Rebeka has 6 marbles and she wants to distribute them equally among 4 groups, each group will get 1 marble. Therefore, Group 1 will have 1 marble, Group 2 will have 1 marble, Group 3 will have 1 marble, and Group 4 will also have 1 marble. In conclusion, each group will have 2 eggs and 1 marble.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 4 cups and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 15 eggs by 3 groups.  So, if we divide 15 eggs by 3, we get 5 eggs per group. Therefore, each group of eggs will have 5 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebeka wants to divide her collection of eggs into groups of 6. She has 18 eggs in total. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide the number of eggs by 6: 18 / 6 = 3. So, Rebeka can create 3 groups of 6 eggs each. Now let's consider the other ingredients: bananas and marshmallows. Since there are 72 bananas and 66 marshmallows, we can also divide them into groups of 6. For example, we can give 12 bananas (72 / 6) and 9 marshmallows (66 / 6) to each group. Therefore, Rebeka can create 3 groups of eggs and 3 groups of bananas and marshmallows.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of three, how many groups can she make? Well, if we divide 99 by 3, we get 33. So, Rebeka can create 33 groups with her bananas and eggs. Now, let's consider the cups. If Rebeka has 27 cups, and each group requires 3 cups, then she can create 27/3 = 9 groups with her cups. Therefore, in total, Rebeka can create 33 + 9 = 42 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. If we divide the eggs equally among groups of 5, then each group will get 4 eggs (20/5 = 4). Now, let's count how many marbles are in each group: if there are 4 eggs in each group, then there are 1.5 marbles per egg (since there are 6 marbles in total and 4 eggs in each group). So, there are 6 x 1.5 = 9 marbles in total among all the groups. Therefore, there are more marbles than eggs in Rebeka's collection. The difference between the number of eggs and marbles is 4 - 9 = -5. Hence, there are -5 marbles for every 4 eggs in Rebeka's collection.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20, then each group will have 20/5 = 4 marbles and 20/12 = 1.67 eggs (since you can't have a fraction of an egg). So there are more eggs than marbles in Rebeka's collection. Therefore, the correct answer is: More eggs than marbles.
Response:  If Luka played three games and scored 154 points in total, that means he scored an average of 51 points per game (154/3 = 51). Now, if we know that he scored 11 points in each round, then he must have played 5 rounds (51 / 11 = 5). Therefore, Luka played 5 rounds or games.
"Response:  If Luka has played 177 rounds in the game and he scored 46 points in each round, then he would have scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total points} = \text {Number of rounds} \times \text{Points per round} $$

So, the total number of points that Luka has scored is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total points}} = 177 \times 46 = 8322 $$
Therefore, the answer to the question is $8322$."
Response:  If Luka has scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of trival games and he has scored the same number of points in each round as many points he scored in one round, then we can write an equation: Points = x where x is the number of points Luka scored in one round. Since Luka played 2 rounds, we have: Points = x + x = 168 Therefore, the answer is 168.
Response:  If Luka has scored 146 points in each round of the game, then he has scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,982 points in the entire game. Therefore, the answer is 21,982.
Response:  If Luka scored 3 points in each round and played 3 rounds, then he scored a total of 3 x 3 = 9 points. Since there were 78 points in total, we can divide the total score by the number of points scored to find out how many rounds Luka played:  Total score = Number of rounds played x Points scored per round  So, 78 points / 9 points = 9 rounds. Therefore, Luka played 9 rounds.
Response:  Emily had 2 zirns and managed to make 32 ogrlicies. So, she needed 16 zrnas (32 / 2 = 16) for each ogrlice. Therefore, the answer is 16 zrnas were needed for each ogrlice.
Response:  We know that Emily made 11 ogrlici and each ogrlic has 28 zrna. So, we can write an equation: Number of zrna = Total number of ogrlici x Number of zrna per ogrlic. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of zrna = 11 x 28 = 308 zrna. Therefore, Emili had 308 kruseka.
Response:  Emi has 16 zircons and wants to make ogrlics for her friends. Each ogrlica requires 8 zirconia. So, if she makes one ogrlica, she will use 8 of her 16 zirconia. If she makes two ogrlicas, she will use 16 zirconia (2 x 8 = 16). Therefore, Emily can make at most 2 ogrlicas using all of her 16 zirconia.
Response:  Emily made 18 ogrlici and had 6 pearls. To make one ogrlici, she needed 2 pearls. So, to make all 18 ogrlici, she needed 18 x 2 = 36 pearls. Therefore, there were 36 pearls in total.
Response:  Emi has made 4 ogrlici and each ogrlici takes 5 zrna. So, she had 4 x 5 = 20 zrna in total.
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 zircons and she wants to make ogrlics for her 72 friends. So, we need to divide 6 by 72 to find out how many ogrlics Emily can make. When we do this, we get: 6 / 72 = 0.0857142857 (round down) Therefore, Emily can make approximately 9 ogrlics.
Response:  Emily had 5 zirns and managed to make 20 ogrlics. So, she needed 4 zirns for each ogrlic (since she made 20 / 5 = 4 ogrlics with 5 zirns). Therefore, the number of zirns required for one ogrlic is 4.
Response:  Emi has 44 friends and she made 26 ogrlics. Each ogrlic takes 2 grains of rice. So, in total, Emily took 2 x 26 = 52 grains of rice. Therefore, Emili had 52 - 26 = 26 krukas of rice left.
Response:  We know that out of 819058 children from Lawrence County, 819058 stayed in camp and only 668278 remained at home. So, we can say that 819058 - 668278 = 150780 more children spent their summer vacation in camp compared to those who stayed at home. Therefore, the answer is 150780.
"Response:  We know that out of 1000 children from Lawrence County, 202958 went to camp and 777622 stayed at home. So, the number of more children who stayed at home compared to those who went to camp is:  
$$ \boxed{ = 777622 - 202958 = 574664 } $$  Therefore, there are $574664$ more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp."
Response:  We know that Lawrence County has 898051 children in total. During summer vacation, 629424 children go to camp, leaving 268627 children at home. Therefore, the number of children remaining at home is 268627.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in Lawrence County and during summer break, 274865 of them stay at home while others go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children go to camp. To do this, we can divide the number of children who don't stay at home (i.e., those who go to camp) by the total number of children. Therefore, the answer is: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children staying at home = 313473 - 274865 = 38809.
Response:  We know that out of 907611 children in the district of Lawrence, 455682 go to camp during summer vacation. So, the number of children who stay at home is:  Number of children who stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who go to camp = 907611 - 455682 = 451939 children.
Response:  We know that out of 800059 children from Lawrence County, 8000 go to camp and 72059 stay at home. So, we have: Number of children who went to camp = 800059 - 8000 = 72059 Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children in Lawrence County - Number of children who went to camp = 828521 - 72059 = 756432 Therefore, there are 756432 children left at home in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that out of 61619 children from Lawrence County, 30% stayed at home (i.e., 20% went to camp). So, the number of children who went to camp is 61619 x 70% = 42875. Therefore, there are 91676 - 42875 = 48801 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that out of 34044 children from the district of Lawrence, 34044 x 0 = 0 go to camp and 134867 x 0 = 0 stay at home. Additionally, we know that 424944 children from outside the district attended the camp. So, the total number of children who attended the camp is: 0 + 0 + 424944 = 425000. Therefore, there were 425000 children in total who attended the camp.
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children from the district of Lawrence, 590796 stayed at home during summer vacation and 22 children from outside the district attended camp. So, to find out how many children are in the district of Lawrence, we need to subtract the number of children who attended camp from the total number of children. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of children in the district of Lawrence = Total number of children - Number of children who attended camp = 610769 - 22 = 608547 children.
Response:  We know that out of 644997 children from the district of Lawrence, only 893835 went to camp and additional 78 children came from outside the district. So, the number of children in the district of Lawrence is:  Number of children in the district of Lawrence = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp + Number of children who came from outside the district Total number of children = 644997 - 893835 + 78 = 260174 children are in the district of Lawrence.

Response:  Adam has more jabokas than Jack. So, if Adam had x jabokas, then Jack had less than x jabokas. Since Jack has 89 portocals and 11 jabokas, we can write an equation: 89 + 11 = x (since Adam has more jabokas). Solving for x, we get: x = 90. Therefore, Adam had 90 jabokas.
Response:  Yesterday (pre-night), Helen baked 31 cookies in the morning and 270 cookies in the afternoon, for a total of 270 + 31 = 301 cookies. Then, she also baked 419 cookies before nightfall, so the total number of cookies she baked until that point is 301 + 419 = 720 cookies. Therefore, the answer to the question is 720.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday), Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies. Today (today), she baked 51 strawberry cookies and 484 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen baked 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 cookies with chocolate chips.
Response:  According to the question, Helen prepared for Thanksgiving with her friends in her house. Yesterday (yuorcos), she baked 527 chocolate cookies and 86 strawberry cookies. Today (today), she baked 86 cookies with starch and 554 cookies with chocolate sprinkles. So, we can calculate how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked today as follows: Total number of cookies baked yesterday = 527 + 86 = 613 Cookies baked today = Total number of cookies baked yesterday - Number of strawberry cookies baked yesterday = 613 - 86 = 527 Chocolate chip cookies baked today = Total number of cookies baked today / 2 = 527/2 = 263.5 Chocolate chip cookies baked by Helen today. Therefore, the answer is 263.5.

So, the total number of colaçíes with chocolate chips that Helen baked is: 19 + 231 = 450. Therefore, the difference between the number of colaçíes with chocolate chips that Helen baked yesterday and today is: 450 - 19 = 431.
"Response:  Yesterday (yesterday means ""juxta"" in Latin), Helen prepared 75 coconut macaroons and 66 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she has already made 46 chocolate chip cookies. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 75 + 46 = 121. Therefore, Helen has made more than 100 chocolate chip cookies since yesterday!"
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Hellen has baked more than 300 collachi with staphid and more than 359 chocolate chip cookies today. So, we can say that she has baked more than 659 collations (300 + 359) altogether. Therefore, Hellen has baked more than 659 collations with staphid and more than 659 collations with chocolate chip cookie combinedly.
Response:  We know that Keity has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So we can write an equation as follows:  Number of games Keity has = 81 Number of games friends have = 59 To find out how many more games Keity has than her friends, we subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Keity has:  Difference between Keity's games and friend's games = 81 - 59 = 22 Therefore, Keity has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  Kate has 91 games, her new friends have 88 games, and her old friends have 53 games. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:  Total number of games = New friend's games + Old friend's games + Kate's games  Total number of games = 88 + 53 + 91 = 222 games Therefore, Kate's friends together have 222 games.
Response:  Кати has 78 new games and 86 old games, so she has a total of 164 games. Her friends have 48 new games, so they have a total of 48 + 48 = 96 games. Therefore, together they have 164 + 96 = 258 games.
Response:  Кати has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has in total 103 games (84 + 19). Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have in total 77 games (8 + 69). Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77).
Response:  Ката has 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 142 games (62 + 80).  Her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so they have a total of 114 games (73 + 41). Therefore, there are 29 more games that Kat has than her friends (142 - 114 = 28). So, Kat has 29 old games.
Response:  According to the question, Keaty has 63 DS games and her friends have 57 games. To find out how many more games Keaty has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Keaty has: 63 - 57 = 6 So, Keaty has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  According to the question, Keity has 57 new and 39 old games, so she has in total 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now, her friends have 34 new games, so they have in total 34 games. Therefore, Keity has more games than her friends, specifically 96 - 34 = 62 more games.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $60 last week and now he has $51 after spending some money. Then, Jason had $19 and spent $27 on car washing, so he has $33 left. Therefore, Jason earned $33 from car washing.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $86 last week and spent some money on cars during the weekend, so he has $9 left now. Secondly, Jason didn't work and still has $5. Therefore, they have together $9 + $5 = $14.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $19 last week and now he has $40, so his income increased by $21 ($40 - $19). Similarly, Jason had $16 last week and now he has $69, so his income increased by $53 ($69 - $16). Therefore, Fred earned $21 more than Jason during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and now he has $21, so he spent $93 during the weekend.  Next, we know that Jason had $22 last week and now he has $78, so he earned $56 during the weekend. Therefore, Jason made $56 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 and spent some of it on car maintenance during the weekend. So he now has $115. Secondly, Jason had $40 and earned some more money delivering newspapers. Therefore, he now has $44. To find out how much money Fred made from car maintenance, we can subtract the amount he spent ($115 - $111) = $4.
Response:  Fred had $49 last week and spent some money on cars during the weekend, so he now has $112. Jason had $3 last week and delivered newspapers to earn $63 this week. Therefore, Jason earned $63 - $3 = $59 from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Џејсон had $31 last week and he delivered newspapers to earn an additional $14. So, his total amount of money last week was $31 + $14 = $45.  Next, we are told that Fred had $78 last week and he spent some money on car repairs during the weekend. However, we don't know how much he spent exactly. Therefore, let's assume that he spent half of his original amount, which is $78 / 2 = $39. So, his new amount of money after spending on car repairs is $78 - $39 = $39. Now, we need to find out how much Џејсон earned from delivering newspapers. We know that he earned $14 more than Fred, so if Fred earned $39, then ЏејSON earned $39 + $14 = $53. Thus, the total amount of money they both earned from delivering newspapers is $45 (Џејсон) + $53 (Фред) = $98.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 last week and then he earned $16 for delivering newspapers during the weekend. Therefore, his total earnings from newspapers are: $33 + $16 = $49. Now, let's consider Jason's earnings. He had $95 initially and then he earned $74 for working on cars over the weekend. So, his total earnings are: $95 + $74 = $169. Therefore, Fred earned $49 during the weekend while Jason earned $169.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $47 last week and then he earned $111 delivering newspapers during the weekend, so now he has $56 ($47 + $111). Then, he spent $34 repairing his car, reducing his total amount to $52 ($56 - $34). Therefore, Fred currently has $52.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesy initially weighed 71 kilograms (kg). Then, she started running every day and lost 20 kg. So, her new weight is: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg. Therefore, Jesy now weighs 51 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms ( kg). Then, she lost 101 kilograms after starting to run every day. So, if she initially weighed x kilograms before starting to run, then we can write an equation as follows: 27 = x - 101 Now, let's solve for x using subtraction: x = 138 kilograms Therefore, Jessie initially weighed 138 kilograms before starting to run every day.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. After running every day for some time, she lost weight and currently weighs 66 kg. So, her original weight was 126 kg - 66 kg = 60 kg. Therefore, Jessie originally weighed 60 kg before starting to run every day.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 74 kg (163 lbs). After running every day for 2 months, she lost 35 kg (77 lbs), so her new weight is: 74 kg - 35 kg = 39 kg (86 lbs)
Response:  First week (50 kg): $ \text { initial weight} = 114 \text{ kg}$ $ \text{weight loss in first week} = 50 \text{ kg}$ $\therefore \text{new weight after first week} = \text{initial weight} - \text{weight loss in first week} = 114 \text{ kg} - 50 \text{ kg} = 64 \text{ kg}$ Second week (60 kg): $ \text{initial weight} = 64 \text{ kg}$ $ \text{weight loss in second week} = 60 \text{ kg}$ $\therefore \text{new weight after second week} = \text{initial weight} - \text{weight loss in second week} = 64 \text{ kg} - 60 \text{ kg} = 8 \text{ kg}$ So, Jesi now weighs 8 kg.
Response:  First week (day 1-7):  Jessie started running and lost 62 kg in one week. So her weight after one week is: $9 \text{ kg} - 62 \text{ kg} = 53 \text{ kg}$ Second week (day 8-14): Jessie continued to run and lost another 140 kg in one week. So her weight after two weeks is: $53 \text{ kg} - 140 \text{ kg} = 87 \text{ kg}$ Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed $9 \text{ kg}$.
Response:  First week (day 1-7): Jessie weighed 92 kg. Since she lost 56 kg in the first week, her weight after one week is: 92 kg - 56 kg = 36 kg.
Response:  We know that in one kavez there are 95 zmiies and 61 alligators. If we take away 64 snakes from this cave, then the number of remaining snakes is: Number of snakes = Total number of snakes - Number of snakes taken away = 95 - 64 = 31 So, 31 zmiies are left in the cave after taking away 64 zmiies.
Response:  We know that there were initially 97 aligators in the tank and now we are told that 40 of them are hiding. So, if 40 aligators are hiding, then the number of aligators not hiding is:  Number of aligators not hiding = Total number of aligators - Number of aligators hiding = 97 - 40 = 57 aligators.
Response:  We know that in the zoo there were initially 3 zmiе and 75 alligators. If we add 82 more snakes to this number, then the total number of reptiles in the cage will be:  Total number of reptiles = Number of snakes + Number of alligators = 82 + 75 = 157 Now, if we subtract the number of alligators that are hiding (19), we get the remaining number of alligators: Remaining number of alligators = Total number of reptiles - Number of alligators hiding = 157 - 19 = 138 Therefore, there are 138 alligators left in the cage after 82 snakes have been added.
Response:  We know that there are 79 living things in the terrarium. If we subtract 24 snakes and 51 alligators from this number, we get: 79 - 24 = 55  So, there are 55 other living things in the terrarium besides snakes and alligators.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer had 171 parades in his garden. If he chose 134 of them yesterday and today he has 30 more, then we can calculate how many parades are left for him as follows: Total number of parades = 171 - 134 + 30 = 97 Parades So, after today, the farmer will have 97 parades left in his garden.
"Response:  Yesterday, the farmer had 160 parades in his garden. If he picked 56 yesterday and today he has 41, then we can calculate how many are left as follows:

Number of parades left = Total number of parades - Number picked yesterday - Number picked today
= 160 - 56 + 41
= 73

Therefore, there are 73 parades left in the farmer's garden after both days of harvesting."
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer had 90 parades in his garden. Today, he has picked 154 + 50 = 204 parades. So, the total number of parades collected by the farmer is 90 + 204 = 304.
"Response:  We know that the farmer had 175 parsley and 77 cabbages in his garden. If he harvested 172 cabbages, then the number of remaining cabbages is:

Remaining cabbages = Total cabbages - Harvested cabbages
= 77 - 172
= -95

So, there are no remaining cabbages."
Response:  We know that the farmer had 177 parsley and 12 crompirs in his garden. If he took care of 53 parsley, then we can calculate how many parsley and crompirs he has left as follows: Number of parsley after taking care of 53 = 177 - 53 = 124 Number of crompirs after taking care of 53 = 12 - 53 = -40 So, the farmer has 124 parsley and -40 crompirs left in his garden.
Response:  We know that the farmer had 105 green pomegranates and 71 red pomegranates in his garden initially. If he has brushed away 137 paradeisae, then we can calculate how many pomegranates are left using the following formula: Number of pomegranates left = Total number of pomegranates - Number of brushed pomegranates So, in this case, the total number of pomegranates is 105 + 71 = 176. Now, if he has brushed away 137 paradeisae, then the number of pomegranates left is: 176 - 137 = 39 Therefore, there are 39 pomegranates left in the farmer's garden after he has brushed away 137 paradeisae.
Response:  We know that John used 4 black men to glue large wooden planks. If it takes 2 pieces of chewing gum for each plank, then how many pieces of chewing gum did John use in total?  So, we can write an equation: Number of pieces of chewing gum = Total number of planks x Number of pieces of chewing gum per plank Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of pieces of chewing gum = 4 x 2 = 8 pieces of chewing gum Therefore, John used 8 pieces of chewing gum to glue the large wooden planks.
Response:  We know that for each large wooden plate, John needs 13 pieces of black paint to cover it completely. Therefore, if he has n smaller plates, he will need n x 13 = 13n pieces of black paint in total. Now we are given that John needs 8 additional pieces of black paint beyond what is needed for the large plates. So, the total number of black paint pieces John needs is 13n + 8 = 21n.
Response:  John used a total of 11 chisels to break through the large wooden planks. Each plank required 3 chisel blows to crack it. Since there were additional 8 chisels used, we can assume that each plank took 2 more blows with an average force of 3 chisels per blow (since he had extra). So, in total, John needed 6 x 3 = 18 blows for each plank and since he broke through 5 planks, he needed 18 x 5 = 90 blows to break through all 5 planks. Therefore, John needs 90 blows with his hammer to break through the large wooden planks for building his house.
Response:  We know that for each large plate, John needs 3 chips (since there are 12 large plates). Therefore, John needs 36 chips for all the large plates. For each small plate, John needs 2 chips (since there are 10 small plates), so he needs 20 chips in total for all the small plates. So, John needs a total of 56 chips to cover both types of plates. Since we were given that John has already used 15 chips for the large plates, he has 41 chips left (56 - 15 = 41).
Response:  John needs to use 16 dojla (boards) for his house. Each board requires 2 pieces of wood, so he will need 8 pairs of wood. Since each pair of wood is 1 cm wide and long, John will need 8 x 10 = 80 cm of wood in total. Therefore, John needs 80 cm of blackwood for his house.
Response:  We know that John needs 8 large wooden planks for his house. Each plank requires 74 cloves of garlic to be varnished. So, in total, John needs 74 x 8 = 592 cloves of garlic to varnish all the wooden planks he needs for his house.
Response:  We know that John needs to cover 12 large and 17 small wooden planks with tiles.  Each large plank requires 14 ceramic tiles for full coverage, while each small plank requires 25 ceramic tiles. Therefore, we need to calculate how many total ceramic tiles are needed as follows: Total number of ceramic tiles = Number of large planks x Required tiles per large plank + Number of small planks x Required tiles per small plank Total number of ceramic tiles = 12 x 14 + 17 x 25 Total number of ceramic tiles = 1680 Now, let's convert this amount into square meters. Since one tile covers an area of 0.09 square meters (as given in the problem statement), we can calculate the total surface area covered by the tiles as follows: Total surface area = Total number of ceramic tiles x Area per tile Total surface area = 1680 x 0.09 Total surface area = 153.6 square meters So, John needs approximately 153.6 square meters of ceramic tiles to cover the wooden planks in his house.
Response:  We know that Robin has packages of gum with 3 pieces in each package and a total of 42 pieces of gum. To find out how many packages Robin has, we can divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each package: Number of packages = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per package So, if we divide 42 by 3, we get: Number of packages = 14 Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of gum and in each package there are 23 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is: 43 x 23 = 1005 pieces. Now we need to find out how many pieces of gum Robin actually has. According to the question, Robin has 8 pieces of gum. Therefore, the number of pieces of gum that Robin actually has is: 1005 - 8 = 997 pieces.
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 additional pieces of iron. If each package contains 7 pieces of iron, then the total number of pieces of iron in all packages is: 7 x = 42 Since Robin has 42 pieces of iron, and there are 6 packages, we can conclude that each package contains: 42 / 6 = 7 pieces of iron So, Robin has 7 packages of iron.
Response:  Robin has 28 packages of tobacco and 13 packages of sweets. In each package, there are 4 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum from tobacco and 13 x 4 = 52 pieces of gum from sweets. Therefore, Robin has a total of 112 + 52 = 164 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces. So, in total, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. Now, we are also given that Robin has 45 packets of candy, and each packet contains 9 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has is 45 x 9 = 375 pieces.
"Response:  Robin has 28 packages of tobacco and 14 packages of sweets. In each package, there are 6 pieces. So, in total, Robin has:

Tobacco: 28 x 6 = 168 pieces
Sweets: 14 x 6 = 84 pieces
Therefore, Robin has 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of tobacco and sweets in total."
Response:  We know that an industrial machine can make 3 shirts in one minute and has made a total of 6 shirts. To find out how many minutes the machine worked, we need to divide the number of shirts it made by the number of shirts it can make per minute. So, we have: Number of minutes = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per minute  In this case, the total number of shirts is 6, and the number of shirts per minute is 3 (since the machine can make 1 shirt in 1 minute). Therefore, we can calculate the time as follows: Number of minutes = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes The industrial machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  If an industrial machine worked for 5 minutes and could produce 4 shirts in one minute, then it produced 4 x 5 = 20 shirts during those 5 minutes. So, the machine produced 20 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in total. Today, it made 44 shirts. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 35 shirts (44 - 9). If the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, then it worked for 35 / 3 = 11 minutes yesterday. Therefore, the machine worked for 11 minutes yesterday.
Response:  If an industrial machine made 13 shirts yesterday and today it makes 3 shirts per minute, then in total it has worked for 13 + 3 = 16 minutes. So, the machine worked for 16 minutes in total.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in total. Today, it made 8 shirts. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 1 shirt. If the machine can make 2 shirts per minute, then the time taken to make 1 shirt is 1/2 minutes. Therefore, the number of minutes the machine worked today is: Number of minutes = Total number of shirts produced - Shirts produced yesterday Total number of shirts produced = 8 - 9 = -1 Shirts produced yesterday = 0 Shirts produced today = 8 Minutes = (-1) x 1/2 = -1/2 minutes So, the machine worked for half a minute today.
Response:  If an industrial machine can make 3 shirts in one minute and yesterday it made 4 shirts, then today it made half as many shirts (2 x 4 = 8). So, the number of shirts made per minute is decreasing at a rate of 1/2 every day. Therefore, to find out how many shirts the machine made in total during this period, we need to calculate the total time elapsed between these days. We know that there are 7 days between these two dates (yesterday and today), so the total time elapsed is: Time = 7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours Total number of shirts made = Number of shirts made per hour x Total time elapsed = 3 shirts/minute x 168 hours = 504 shirts In conclusion, the industrial machine made 504 shirts during the given period.
Response:  If industrial machine can make 6 shirts in one minute and yesterday it worked for 12 minutes, then it made a total of 6 x 12 = 72 shirts yesterday. And if today it worked for 14 minutes, then it made a total of 6 x 14 = 84 shirts today. So, the answer is 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  If the machine could make 6 shirts in 5 minutes yesterday and today it made 12 shirts in 5 minutes, then we can calculate how many shirts the machine made today as follows:  Yesterday, the machine made 6 shirts in 5 minutes = 6 x 5 = 30 shirts per hour Today, the machine made 12 shirts in 5 minutes = 12 x 5 = 60 shirts per hour Therefore, the machine made 30 + 60 = 90 shirts today.
"Response:  If they were making the same amount of money every day ( $165 in total for 5 days), then we can calculate their daily income as follows:
Daily income = Total income / Number of days
= $165 / 5
= $33 per day
Therefore, they were making $33 per day during Carnival."
"Response:  The game at the carnival earned $144 per day. They were at the carnival for 22 days. So, they earned:
$$ \text {Total earnings} = \text {Number of days} \times \text{Earnings per day} $$
In this case:
$$ \text {Total earnings} = 22 \times 144 = 3068 $$
So, they earned $3068 during their time at the carnival."
"Response:  We know that the game at the ring toss booth made $420 in 30 days and together with the game they earned $22. So we can calculate how much the game ""Ring Toss"" made per day as follows:  Percentage of total earnings = Daily earnings / Total earnings x 100%  Daily earnings = Earnings from the game / Number of days  In this case, daily earnings = $420 / 30 days = $14 per day Now we have found out that the game ""Ring Toss"" made $14 per day."
Response:  First 44 days = $382 x 44 = $16,596 Second 10 days = $374 x 10 = $3,740 Total income = $16,596 + $3,740 = $20,336
Response:  The game earned $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days for a total of $186. So, the daily earnings were: $186 / 46 days = $4.13 per day.
Response:  The carnival earned $325 in its first 154 days and $114 in the remaining 57 days. To find out how much it earned per day during those last 57 days, we can divide the total amount earned ($114) by the number of days left (57): $114 / 57 = $2.00 per day. Therefore, the carnival earned $2.00 per day during the last 57 days of the carnival.
Response:  If Lucia bought 10 packages of bread and 4 packages of cake, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages of baked goods. Since the question asks how many more packages of cola she bought over the torte, we can deduce that she did not buy any packages of cola. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  According to the question, Lucia bought 4 packages of cookies (22 packets), 22 packages of cake (torte), and 16 packages of chocolate. Therefore, in total she bought:  Cookies = 4 x 22 = 88 packets of food Cake = 22 packets of food Chocolate = 16 packets of food Total = 88 + 22 + 16 = 136 packets of food So, Lucia bought 136 packets of food in total.
"Response:  According to the question, Lucia bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of cake. So, she had x packages of food in total. Since she also bought some packages of cake, we can assume that x is greater than or equal to 27 (the number of packages of food she bought). Therefore, the answer is:
x = 27 or more."
Response:  Firstly, Lucia bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes. The cost of each pack of cookies is $3, and the cost of each pack of cakes is $4. Therefore, the total amount she spent on cookies is $6 (2 x $3), and the total amount she spent on cakes is $48 (12 x $4). Now, let's subtract the amount she spent on both from the initial amount of money she had ($50): $50 - $6 - $48 = $7. So, Lucia bought $7 worth of food in total.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on at the next station. So, now we have: 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry no more than 36 people, we know that the maximum number of people who could be in the bus is:  16 < 36, so the correct answer is: 16 people are currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got into the bus at the next station, so now we have 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people got off the bus, leaving us with 20 - 3 = 17 people still in the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got into the bus. So, now there are 17 people (4 + 13) in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got into the train, so the total number of people in the train is now: 11 + 8 = 19 people.
Response:  If 22 parents participated in the program and altogether 676 people were present at the program, then we can calculate the number of students as follows: Number of students = Total number of participants / Number of parent-student pairs So, if there are 22 parents who participated in the program, each pair consists of one parent and one student. Therefore, the total number of students is equal to 676 (total number of participants) divided by 22 (number of parent-student pairs): Number of students = 676/22 = 30 Students have been present at the program.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 73 parents who attended the program. Then, we are told that there were 724 students and 744 teachers present as well. Therefore, the total number of people attending the program is equal to the sum of these three numbers: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531 people. So, there were 1531 individuals present at the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in the program. To find out how many students were present compared to parents, we need to divide the number of students by the number of parents. So, the ratio of students to parents is:  Number of students / Number of parents = 521 / 174 = 3.01  Therefore, there were approximately 3.01 times as many students as parents in the program.
"Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in total. The program could accommodate 44 people at most. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:

Number of people present = Total number of parents + Total number of students - Maximum capacity of the program

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of people present = 61 + 177 - 44
= 280
Therefore, there were 280 people present at the program."
Response:  If they are currently at a depth of 919 meters inside the cave and need to travel 1307 meters away from the cave entrance, then we can calculate the distance as follows: Distance = Depth + Travelled Length = 919 + 1307 = 2226 meters. Therefore, the distance away from the cave entrance is 2226 meters.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and they are currently at 849 feet. To find out how far they have to go until they reach the end of the cave, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Initial Position. In this case, the speed is 17 miles per hour, which means they will cover 17 x 60 = 1020 feet in one hour. So, if it takes them 3 hours to reach the end of the cave, they will be 1020 x 3 = 3060 feet away from their starting position. Therefore, the distance between their current location and the end of the cave is 3060 feet.
Response:  We are currently at 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet deep. To find out how far we have to go until we reach the end of the cave, we need to subtract the current depth from the total depth: Distance = Total Depth - Current Depth = 762 - 659 = 133 feet Therefore, it is 133 feet further down the cave before reaching the end.
Response:  We know that without a home, the stray cat liked to eat goldfish in the lake, leaving behind 6 golden fish. Payge first raised 8 golden fish in the pond. So, how many golden fish have disappeared? To find out, we need to subtract the number of golden fish left behind by the stray cat from the total number of golden fish raised by Payge. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of missing golden fish = Total number of golden fish raised by Payge - Number of golden fish left behind by the stray cat = 8 - 6 = 2.
"Response:  We know that Pejg had 7 goldfish and 12 mice in the pond initially.  The cunning cats ate some of them, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that they ate half of the mice (6). Now, we have:

Number of goldfish = 7
Number of mice = 6 + 12 = 18

After the cats ate some of the mice, Pejg has 15 left. Therefore, the number of mice that were eaten by the cats is:

Number of mice eaten by cats = 15 - 18 = -3

So, the number of goldfish that were left after the cats ate some of the mice is:

Number of goldfish left = 7 - (-3) = 10

Therefore, the final answer is:

Number of goldfish remaining = 10"
Response:  According to the question, Pejg had 16 zlatne riba and 71 cats in a lake. However, the fish-eating cats liked them so much that they ate 49 of them (16 x 3 = 48). So, now Pejg has left with 16 - 49 = 2 zlatne riba.
Response:  We know that Pejg has raised 15 golden fish in a lake and that some mice have eaten 5 of them. To find out how many goldfish are left, we can use the following equation: Number of remaining goldfish = Total number of goldfish - Number of eaten goldfish So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of remaining goldfish = 15 - 5 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 golden fish left in the lake.
Response:  The chef had 2 jabuke after he made the pies, and initially, he had 43 jabukes. So, if we subtract the number of jabukes he had after making the pies from the initial number of jabukes, we get:  Number of jabukes the chef used = 43 - 2 = 41 jabukes. Therefore, the chef used 41 jabukes to make the pies.
Response:  If the chef had 58 jabuks and used 35 of them to make pies, then he has 23 jabuk left (58 - 35 = 23).
Response:  If the chef had 40 jabokcs and made 54 pies, then he used 14 jabukc for each pie (since there are 54 / 4 = 13.5 pieces per jabuk). Therefore, he has 40 - 14 = 26 jabukc left after making the pies.
Response:  Adam has 11 action figures and his room has 4 shelves (policies). Each policy can hold 4 action figures, so the total number of action figures that can be placed on each policy is 4 x 11 = 44. Since there are 4 policies in total, the maximum number of action figures that Adam can place on all the policies together is 44 x 4 = 176. Therefore, the answer to the question is 176.
Response:  Adam can place 10 action figures on each shelf in his room. Since he has 5 shelves, he can accommodate 5 x 10 = 50 action figures in total. However, since his room can hold only 8 action figures, we need to subtract 8 from 50 to get the number of action figures that can fit in his room: 50 - 8 = 42 action figures. Therefore, there are 42 action figures that can fit in Adam's room.
"Response:  Adam can put 8 action figures and 10 boxes on each of his four shelves. Therefore, he can have a total of: 8 x 4 = 32 action figures; 10 x 4 = 40 boxes. So, in total, Adam can keep 32 + 40 = 72 items on his shelves."
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 pots. Therefore, the total number of pots is 10 x 544 = 5440. Since each pot contains 32 flowers, the total number of flowers in all 10 gardens is 5440 x 32 = 176,800 flowers. So, there are 176,800 flowers in all.
Response:  We know that there are 466 pockets in total. Each pocket contains 53 flowers and 181 bees. So, we have: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,098 flowers Total number of bees = 466 x 181 = 87,666 bees Therefore, there are 24,098 flowers and 87,666 bees in all.
Response:  We know that there are 141 pockets in total and each pocket has either 71 flowers or 91 sticks. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of pockets with flowers x Number of flowers per pocket Total number of sticks = Number of pockets with sticks x Number of sticks per pocket Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9670 Total number of sticks = 141 x 91 = 12530 Therefore, there are 9670 flowers and 12530 sticks in all the pockets combined.
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 flowers and there are total of 400 flowers in all pots. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pots = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot Therefore, we have: Number of pots = 400 / 40 = 10 So, there are 10 pots in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in Steve's collection and 4276 gummies. Since we want to find out how many groups of each candy Steve has, let's divide both numbers by the number of candies per group (which is unknown). So, we have: Number of skittles = 4502 /? Number of gummies = 4276 /? Now, we need to find out what value fits best into the blank spaces. Let's analyze the information given in the problem: • The total number of candies is 4502 + 4276 = 8788. This means that if we divide the number of skittles and gummies equally between two groups, then each group will contain half of the total number of candies. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this idea: Number of skittles / Number of gummies = Half of 8788. Solving for the missing values, we get: Number of skittles = 8788 / 2 = 4394 Number of gummies = 8788 / 2 = 4394 Now, we check our answers by multiplying the number of skittles and gummies by their respective groups: Number of skittles in each group = 4394 x 154 = 666,800 Number of gummies in each group = 4394 x 154 = 666,800 As expected, the product of the number of skittles and gummies in each group matches the original total number of candies! Therefore, the answer to the question is: Number of groups of skittles = 154 Number of groups of gummies = 154
Response:  We know that there are 3941 skittles in Stephen's collection and 4950 guppies. Since we want to find out how many groups of guppies can fit into the total number of skittles, we will divide the number of guppies by the number of skittles. So, we have: Number of guppies = 4950 Guppies / Number of skittles = 4950 / 3941 = 12 Therefore, there are 12 groups of guppies that can fit into the total number of skittles.
Response:  We know that there are 896 skittles in Stephen's collection and we want to divide them into groups of equal size. If we divide them equally among 8 groups, then each group will contain how many skittles?  So, the number of skittles in each group is:  Number of skittles / Number of groups = 896 / 8 = 112 skittles per group.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class  Here is the calculation: Number of students = 304 x 75  Number of students = 22,500 Therefore, there were 22,500 students in total at the school.
