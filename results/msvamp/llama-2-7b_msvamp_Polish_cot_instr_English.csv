Response:  In Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 18 children.  In Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 10 children. So, in total, Julia played with more children in Monday than in Tuesday. The difference between these numbers is: 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 11 children. On Tuesday, she played with 12 children. So, in total, Julia played with 11 + 12 = 23 children. Therefore, Julia bawied more children on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  Julia played with five children on Monday and then with other children on Wednesday. If she played with 15 children on Wednesday, that means she played with 10 more children than she did on Monday (5 + 10 = 15). So, Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 10 children on Wednesday.
Response:  In Monday, she played with 5 children. On Wednesday, she played with 14 children. So, in total, she played with 9 (5 + 14) children.
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children in Monday and more than 12 children in Tuesday, then she must have played with at least 16 + 12 = 28 children in total. So, the answer is 28.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children in Tuesday and then played with 8 other children on Wednesday, that means she played with a total of 22 children (14 + 8). Therefore, the correct answer is 22.
Response:  On Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 17 children.  On Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday (środa), she played with only 2 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 15 children.  In Tuesday, she played with 18 children.  So far, Julia has played with 33 children (15 + 18). Now, let's consider Wednesday. The question states that Julia played with 97 children in Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played with is: 33 + 97 = 120 children.
Response:  In Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 5 children.  In Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 9 children.  And in Wednesday (środa), she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children.
Response:  Julia played with 2 children on Monday, so she had 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 games of hide-and-seek with children in total.
Response:  In Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 9 children.  In Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 7 children.  To find out how many more children Julia played with in Monday than in Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with in Tuesday from the number of children she played with in Monday:  9 - 7 = 2  So, Julia played with 2 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.
Response:  In Poniedziałek (Monday), Julia played with 14 children.  In Wtorek (Tuesday), she played with 2 children.  And in Środa (Wednesday), she played with 8 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children in Monday than in any other day. Therefore, the answer is:  More than 8.
Response:  Julia played with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. So, in total, she played with 8 + 11 + 9 = 28 children. Therefore, there are more children that Julia played with on Tuesday than on Wednesday (11 - 9 = 2).
"Response:  In Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 15 children.  In Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 18 children. And in Wednesday (środa), she played with 7 children. So, let's count how many more children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday together than in Wednesday:

Monday + Tuesday = 15 + 18 = 33
Wednesday = 7
So, there are 26 more children that Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday than in Wednesday."
Response:  On Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 13 children.  On Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 10 children. In total, Julia played with 23 children.
Response:  On Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 7 children. In Tuesday (wtorek), she played with 13 children. So far, we have 7 + 13 = 20 children that Julia played with. Now, let's calculate how many children Julia played with in total:  Total number of children Julia played with = Number of children she played with on Monday + Number of children she played with on Tuesday = 7 + 13 = 20 Therefore, Julia played with 20 children in total.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 12 children for 8 hours (from 9 am to 5 pm). Then she took a break and rested for 16 hours (from 5 pm to 9 am Tuesday). On Tuesday, she played with 14 more children for another 8 hours (from 9 am to 5 pm). So in total, Julia spent 34 hours playing with children in both days combined. Therefore, the correct answer is: 12 + 14 = 26 children.
"Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 19 children and spent 20 hours playing (in Polish ""tagania"" means ""playing"").  In Tuesday, she played with 18 children and spent 38 hours playing. So in total, Julia spent more time playing with children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More than 20 hours."
Response:  In Wednesday (we), Julia played with five children.  In Monday (pon), she played with six children. So, in Poniedziałek, Julia played with more than five but fewer than six children. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 < 6 = 1.
Response:  On Monday (poniedziałek), Julia played with 4 children. So, she played with x - 4 children.  On Tuesday (wtorek), Julia played with y children. Since she already played with 4 children on Monday, she had to play with y - 4 = 3 other children on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played with 3 + x = 3 + 4 = 7 different children in total.
Response:  In Wednesday (środa), Julia played with 4 kids.  In Monday (poniedziałek), she played with 6 + 17 = 23 kids. So, Julia played with more kids in Monday than in Wednesday.
Response:  If Bobby had eaten some candy initially (let's say he ate x pieces), then he ate an additional 25 pieces after that. So, in total, he ate x + 25 pieces of candy. Now, we are told that if he ate 43 pieces altogether, then the number of pieces he ate at first is equal to 43 - 25 = 18. Therefore, Bobby initialy ate 18 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 cookies and then he ate another 42. So far, he has eaten a total of 28 + 42 = 70 cookies. Then, he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to one cookie, Bobby has eaten a total of 63 / 1 = 63 cookies in addition to the ones he already ate. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Bobby has eaten is 70 + 63 = 133 cookies.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then he ate four more. So far, he has eaten a total of 37 pieces of candy (33 + 4 = 37). Then, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, in total, Bobby has eaten 51 pieces of candy and chocolate (37 + 14 = 51).
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 candies and then he ate 36 more. So, in total, he ate 74 candies. Now, let's find out how many more candies he ate than chocolates. According to the problem, Bobby also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of candies = 74 Number of chocolates = 16 To solve for the difference between the number of candies and chocolates, subtract the number of chocolates from the number of candies: Difference = Number of candies - Number of chocolates = 74 - 16 = 58 In conclusion, Bobby ate 58 more candies than chocolates.
Response:  Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces. Then he ate another 18 pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 52 pieces of candy (20 + 34 + 18). Therefore, Bobby ate 52 kawałki (or pieces) of candy.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 21 pieces of candy. If he ate 5 pieces, then he had 21 - 5 = 16 remaining pieces of candy. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 remaining pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby still has 7 pieces of candy left.
"Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. If he ate some, then he had less than 22 pieces. How much did he eat? We are told that he ate ""trochę"" which means ""a little"". So let's assume that he ate half of his initial amount, which is 11 pieces (half of 22). Now he has 11 + 5 = 16 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby initially had 11 kawałków cukierków and ate 11 more later, so he has 8 - 11 = -3 kawałki cukierków left."
Response:  Bobby had 19 candy pieces initially. If he ate 2 pieces, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 candy pieces left. So, Bobby still has 17 candy pieces.
"Response:  We know that Bobby had 32 pieces of candy initially and he ate some of them. The number of pieces of candy he ate is given as ""trochę"". This means that Bobby ate less than half of his initial amount of candy. So, if he had 32 pieces of candy initially and he ate less than half of them, then he has 32 - (less than half) = x pieces of candy left. Since we are told that he has 20 pieces of candy now, we can set up the equation: 32 - (less than half) = 20. Solving for the value of ""less than half"", we get: 32 - (x/2) = 20. Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 16. Therefore, Bobby has 16 pieces of candy left after eating some of his initial supply."
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 candy pieces and then he ate 17 of them. So, he has 36 - 17 = 19 left. Then, he ate another 15 candy pieces, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 remaining. Therefore, Bobby has 4 candy pieces left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 30 candy pieces and he ate 23 of them. So, how many did he have left? We can calculate it as follows: Number of remaining candy = Total number of candies - Number of eaten candy = 30 - 23 = 7 Therefore, Bobby has 7 candy pieces left.
Response:  Alan threw 5 balloons and Jake threw 3 to the park. So, in total, there are 8 balloons (5 + 3). Now, we need to find out how many more balloons Alan has than Jake. To do this, we can subtract the number of balloons that Jake threw from the total number of balloons thrown by Alan: 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Allen has 2 more balloons than Jake in the park.
"Response:  If Alan brought two balloons to the park and Jake had three more than Alan in the park, then we can write an equation as follows:  Two = x (where ""x"" is the number of balloons that Jake has). So, if Jake has x balloons, then he has 3 more than Alan, which means he has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park, then we can say that Allan brought half of the total number of balloons to the park (since he brought 2 out of 6). So, Jake brought 3 - 2 = 1 more balloon than Allan to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 1 more balloon to the park than Allan did.
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons and he brought 4 more than Allan, then Allan brought x balloons. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake = 6 + 4 =? + X  Where 'X' is the number of balloons brought by Allan. Now, we need to solve for 'X'. We know that Jake brought 6 balloons initially, so 'Jake' represents 6 in the equation above. Therefore, we can substitute 'Jake' = 6 into the equation: 6 + 4 =? + X  Substituting 'Jake' = 6, we get: 10 =? + X  Now, we are given that Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan, so Allan brought x - 4 balloons. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows: 10 =? + (x - 4)  Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 = x - 4  Solving for 'x', we get: x = 6  Therefore, Allan brought 6 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 6 more than Allan, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Alan had 3 balloons and gave 2 to Jake, so now Alan has 3 - 2 = 1 balloon left. Then, Jake got 5 balloons from Alan in the park, so now Jake has 5 + 1 = 6 balloons in total. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Alan and Jake have in the park is 6.
"Response: 
Alan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more in the park. So, he had five balloons in total (2 + 3 = 5).
Jake brought four balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake had four balloons in total (4 = 4).
So, Allen has more balloons than Jake in the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 5 - 4 = 1."
"Response: 
Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more in the park. So, at first, he had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons.
Jake had 6 balloons initially. Then, after Alan bought 3 more balloons, Jake still had 6 - 3 = 3 balloons left.
Therefore, Jake had more balloons than Alan in the park. The difference between their initial number of balloons is 3 (Jake) - 5 (Allen)."
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons and gave 4 to Jake, so he has 1 more than Jake (5 - 4 = 1). Then, Alan bought 3 balloons in the park, which means that now he has 1 + 3 = 4 balloons in total. So, the number of balloons Alan brought to the park is 4.
Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons and gave 2 to Jake in the park. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park. So, at this point, Jake has 5 balloons (2 he got from Alan + 3 he bought). Now, let's compare how many balloons each of them has:  Alan has 6 - 2 = 4 balloons left, and Jake has 5 + 3 = 8 balloons. Therefore, Allen has fewer balloons than Jake in the park.
"Response: 
Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and then bought 2 more (since he had 6 + 2 = 8 balloons in total).
Jake started with 0 balloons at home and then bought 3 balloons in the park, so he had 3 balloons initially. Then, he bought 4 additional balloons in the park, so he had 7 balloons in total (3 + 4 = 7).
Therefore, Jake had more balloons than Alan in the park - 7 > 8."
Response:  Firstly, Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and then Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Jake brought to the park is 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, Jake brought 8 balloons to the park.
Response:  Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park, so he had 3 + 20 = 23 items in total.  Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the park, so he had 5 + 59 = 64 items in total.  Therefore, Allan and Jake together had 23 + 64 = 87 items in the park, which is equal to 87 balloons.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park, so he had a total of 7 + 5 = 12 objects in the park.  Similarly, we know that Jake brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park, so he had a total of 6 + 4 = 10 objects in the park.  Therefore, Allen and Jake together had 12 + 10 = 22 objects in the park, which means they had 22 balls between them.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 6 more (total of 11), then Jake brought 6 - 5 = 1 additional balloon. So, Jake brought 1 balloon.
Response:  We know that Allan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more. So, in total, he has five balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now we are told that Jake brought six balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake has six balloons more than Allan in the park. In other words, Jake has 11 balloons in the park (6 + 5 = 11). So, the correct answer is: Jake has 11 balloons more than Allan in the park.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. So, he spends a total of 8 hours per day (6 + 2) on learning both languages. Now, we need to find out how many more hours Ryan spends studying English than he does studying Chinese. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends on learning both languages: 8 - 2 = 6 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 6 hours more on studying English than he does on studying Chinese.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, if he spends 6 hours/day studying English and 7 hours/day studying Chinese, then he spends 7 - 6 = 1 hour more per day studying Chinese than English. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more per day studying Chinese than English.
Response:  If he spends 3 hours per day learning English and several hours learning Chinese, then if he spends 4 hours per day learning both languages, he will spend x hours per day learning Chinese. Since he learns Chinese for several hours each day, we can assume that x is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 4. Therefore, the number of hours he spends learning Chinese per day is between 1 and 4 inclusive.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and several hours studying Chinese, then he must spend x hours studying Chinese if he spends y hours more studying English than Chinese. We can write this as an equation:

x = 7 - (y/2)

Now we know that y is equal to 2, so we can plug in this value into the equation:

x = 7 - (2/2)

Simplifying, we get:

x = 7 - 1

Therefore, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying Chinese and several hours per day studying English, then he spends x hours per day studying English if he spends y hours more per day studying English than he does Chinese. We can write this as an equation:
x = 5 + (y - 5)
Now we are given that Ryan spends 2 hours more per day studying English than he does Chinese, so we can substitute y - 5 = 2 into the above equation:
x = 5 + (2 - 5) = 7
Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese for 5 days, then he will spend a total of:

6 x 5 = 30 hours studying English
7 x 5 = 35 hours studying Chinese
Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages over the course of 5 days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese for 2 days, then he will spend a total of:

6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours studying English
5 hours/day x 2 days = 10 hours studying Chinese
Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 22 hours (12 + 10) studying both languages over two days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese for 6 days, then he will spend a total of:

5 x 6 = 30 hours studying English
4 x 6 = 24 hours studying Chinese

Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 54 hours (30 + 24) learning both languages during the period of 6 days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent a total of:

English = 4 x 86 = 352 hours
Chinese = 6 x 86 = 507 hours
Therefore, Ryan will spend 352 hours learning English and 507 hours learning Chinese each day."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, and we also know that he studies Chinese for 7 hours per day. Therefore, in total, Ryan spends 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day on language learning. However, we are asked how many hours he spends on each of these languages separately. So, to find out how many hours Ryan spends on English, Chinese, and Spanish, we can divide the total time spent on language learning (13 hours) among these three languages using their respective proportions. For example, if Ryan spends 2/5 of his time on English, then he spends 2/5 \* 13 = 8.4 hours on English. Similarly, if he spends 3/5 of his time on Chinese, then he spends 3/5 \* 13 = 9.1 hours on Chinese. And finally, if he spends 0.6 hours on Spanish, then he spends 0.6 \* 13 = 7.8 hours on Spanish. Therefore, Ryan spends 8.4 hours on English, 9.1 hours on Chinese, and 7.8 hours on Spanish.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, 3 hours per day studying Chinese, and 58 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we can subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages:

Total time spent studying both languages = 6 + 3 = 9 hours/day
Time spent studying Chinese = 3 hours/day

Now, to find out how many more hours Ryan spends studying English than Chinese, we subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages:

More time spent studying English than Chinese = Total time spent studying both languages - Time spent studying Chinese
= 9 - 3
= 6 hours/day

Therefore, Ryan spends 6 hours more per day studying English than he does studying Chinese."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English, 2 hours per day studying Chinese, and 4 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, let's do that:

Total time spent studying = Time spent studying English + Time spent studying Spanish
= 7 hours/day + 2 hours/day
= 9 hours/day

Now, let's find out how many hours more Ryan spends studying English than Spanish:

Hours spent studying English - Hours spent studying Spanish
= 9 hours/day - 2 hours/day
= 7 hours/day

Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours more per day studying English than he does studying Spanish."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 2 hours per day studying English, 5 hours per day studying Chinese, and 4 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, we have:

Hours spent studying Chinese = 5 hours/day - 4 hours/day = 1 hour/day

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more per day studying Chinese than he does studying Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and Chinese, then he spends 3 + 2 = 5 hours per day studying Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying Chinese.
Response:  Day 1: Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese. Total time spent = 4 + 5 = 9 hours.  Days 2-7: Ryan continues to spend 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, total time spent each day is 4 + 5 = 9 hours (the same as Day 1). So, in total, Ryan spends 9 hours per day learning both languages.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 works of plastic bottles for recycling. The next day, she found 7 works of plastic bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had 8 + 7 = 15 works of plastic bottles on Monday and Tuesday combined. Therefore, Tiffany had 15 - 8 = 7 more works of plastic bottles on Tuesday than she had on Monday.
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 7 works of plastic bottles. If she found 12 more works of plastic bottles next day, then total number of works of plastic bottles that Tiffany collected is:

7 + 12 = 19

So, Tiffany found 19 works of plastic bottles next day."
Response:  If Tiffany collected 4 pouches on Monday and found some more on Tuesday, then she must have collected a total of 6 pouches including the ones she already had (4 + however many she found). So, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Tiffany collected 5 bags of plastic bottles on Sunday and found 4 more bags on Monday, then she must have had 9 bags in total (5 + 4 = 9). So, the correct answer is 9.
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 10 work baskets for recycling. If she found 3 more work baskets on Tuesday and 7 more work baskets on Wednesday, then we can write an equation to represent this information:

Monday = 10 work baskets
Tuesday = 3 + 10 = 13 work baskets
Wednesday = 7 + 13 = 20 work baskets

So in total, Tiffany collected 10 + 13 + 20 = 43 work baskets."
Response:  On Monday (poniedziałek), Tiffany collected 8 bags for recycling. Then, she found 10 more bags on Tuesday and 4 more bags on Wednesday. So, in total, Tiffany found 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 bags after Monday. Therefore, she had 22 - 8 = 14 bags left to collect on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 3 work baskets for recycling. The next day she found 7 more work baskets and 44 plastic bottles. So in total, Tiffany had how many work baskets filled with recyclables?  We can start by adding the number of work baskets from Monday to the number of new work baskets found the next day: 3 + 7 = 10 work baskets.  Therefore, Tiffany had 10 work baskets filled with recyclables in total.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red strawberries and 16 green ones in the basket. To find out how many more red than green strawberries are in the basket, we can use the following equation: Number of red strawberries - Number of green strawberries = Difference between red and green strawberries. In this case, the number of red strawberries is 17, and the number of green strawberries is 16, so we can plug these values into the equation to get: 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there are one more red strawberry than green strawberry in the basket.
"Response:  We have 5 red strawberries and 11 green ones in the basket. To find out how many more green strawberries there are than red ones, we can subtract the number of red strawberries from the total number of strawberries:

Number of green strawberries = Total number of strawberries - Number of red strawberries
= 11 - 5
= 6
Therefore, there are 6 more green strawberries than red ones in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 10 red strawberries and some green ones in the basket. If there are 15 strawberries in total, then the number of green strawberries is equal to 15 - 10 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green strawberries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are three red strawberries and some green ones in the basket. If there are more than ten green strawberries than red ones, then we can say that there are x green strawberries in the basket. Since there are only three red strawberries, we must have at least 3 + x = 10 green strawberries in the basket. So, x = 7. Therefore, there are 7 green strawberries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red grapes in the basket, so we can write this down as follows: 7C (red). Next, we have 15 yellow grapes, which we can represent as 15Y (yellow). Finally, we have 8 green grapes, represented as 8G (green). So, altogether, we have: 7C + 15Y + 8G = 20. Therefore, there are 20 grapes in total in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red cherry tomatoes in the basket, which means we have 7 x 1 = 7 red tomatoes.  Similarly, we know that there are 71 yellow tomatoes in the basket, so we have 71 x 1 = 71 yellow tomatoes. Finally, we know that there are 8 green tomatoes in the basket, so we have 8 x 1 = 8 green tomatoes. Therefore, the number of green tomatoes is greater than the number of red tomatoes. So, the answer to your question is 8 - 7 = 1 more green tomato than red tomato in the basket.
Response:  We have 2 red strawberries and 6 yellow strawberries in the basket. In total, we have 8 strawberries. Now, let's find out how many green strawberries are there. According to the question, there are 14 green strawberries in the basket. So, the number of green strawberries is greater than the number of yellow strawberries. Therefore, the answer is: More green strawberries than yellow strawberries are in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red grapes in the basket and 11 yellow grapes. To find out how many more red grapes than yellow grapes are in the basket, we can use subtraction. So, the number of red grapes minus the number of yellow grapes is equal to 19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more red grapes than yellow grapes in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red cherry tomatoes in the basket. So, we have: 6 red = 6/ total number of tomatoes x 100%  Now, let's find out how many yellow and green tomatoes are in the basket:  Total number of tomatoes = 6 + 90 + 16 = 112  Therefore, the percentage of yellow and green tomatoes is:  Yellow tomatoes = (90 / 112) x 100% = 80% Green tomatoes = (16 / 112) x 100% = 14%  So, there are 80% of yellow tomatoes and 14% of green tomatoes in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red grapes in the basket. To find out how many red and yellow grapes are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of yellow grapes from the total number of grapes. So, if there are 18 red grapes and 14 yellow grapes, then the number of red grapes is 18 - 14 = 4. Similarly, the number of yellow grapes is 14. Therefore, there are 4 red grapes and 14 yellow grapes in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red strawberries in the basket, and each strawberry has 3 seeds. So, we have:

Red strawberries = 5 x 3 = 15 seeds
Total number of seeds = Red + Yellow + Green = 15 + 14 + 6 = 35 seeds
Now, let's find out how many green and yellow strawberries are in the basket:
Green strawberries = Total number of seeds - Red strawberries = 35 - 5 = 30 seeds
Yellow strawberries = Total number of seeds - Red strawberries - Green strawberries = 35 - 5 - 30 = 7 seeds
Therefore, there are 30 green strawberries and 7 yellow strawberries in the basket."
"Response:  We have 65 koszyków of Brussels sprouts. Each koszyk has either 7 red Brussels sprouts or 3 green Brussels sprouts. So, in total we have:

7 x 65 = 455 red Brussels sprouts
3 x 65 = 195 green Brussels sprouts
Therefore, there are 455 + 195 = 650 Brussels sprouts in all the koszyki."
Response:  We have 11 baskets of Brussels sprouts. Each basket contains 10 red Brussels sprouts and 18 green Brussels sprouts. So, in total, we have 10 + 18 = 28 Brussels sprouts in all the baskets combined.
Response:  We have 6 baskets of Brussels sprouts. Each basket contains 16 red Brussels sprouts and 18 green Brussels sprouts. To find out how many red Brussels sprouts are in each basket, we can divide the total number of red Brussels sprouts (16) by the number of baskets (6). So, there are 2 red Brussels sprouts in each basket.
"Response:  We have 7 koszyk... 

Answer: 7 x 10 = 70 red strawberries and 7 x 2 = 14 green strawberries. Therefore, there are 14 green strawberries in total across all 7 koszyks."
Response:  We know that there are 4 red strawberries and 3 green strawberries in each basket. So, if we multiply the number of baskets by the number of strawberries in each basket, we get:  4 x 12 = 48 (red strawberries) + 3 x 9 = 27 (green strawberries) = Total = 75 baskets. Therefore, there are 75 baskets of strawberries.
"Response:  We know that there are two baskets of Brussels sprouts and each basket has either 4 red or green Brussels sprouts. Since there are 12 total Brussels sprouts in each basket, we can write an equation:

Red Brussels sprouts: 4R + X = 12 (where R is the number of red Brussels sprouts)
Green Brussels sprouts: 4G + X = 12 (where G is the number of green Brussels sprouts)

Now, we need to solve for X, which represents the number of green Brussels sprouts in each basket. To do this, we can subtract the number of red Brussels sprouts from both equations:

Red Brussels sprouts: 4R + X - 4R = 12 - 4R
Green Brussels sprouts: 4G + X - 4G = 12 - 4G

Next, we can simplify these equations by combining like terms:

Red Brussels sprouts: 2R + X = 8
Green Brussels sprouts: 2G + X = 8

Now, we can see that X = 4, so there are 4 green Brussels sprouts in each basket. Therefore, the answer is:

There are 4 green Brussels sprouts in each basket."
Response:  We know that there are 16 brzoskwini in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we subtract 13 from 16, we get 3 which is the number of green brzoskwini in the basket. Therefore, there are 3 green brzoskwini in the basket.
"Response:  We know that each basket has 19 red strawberries and 4 green strawberries. If there are 15 baskets in total, then we can calculate how many strawberries there are in total as follows:
Red strawberries = 19 x 15 = 285
Green strawberries = 4 x 15 = 60
So, in total, there are 285 red strawberries and 60 green strawberries."
"Response:  We have 10 baskets and each basket has either red or green Brussels sprouts. Since there are 4 red Brussels sprouts in each basket, we can write an equation for the number of red Brussels sprouts as follows:

Number of red Brussels sprouts = 4 x 10 = 40

Similarly, since there are 6 green Brussels sprouts in each basket, we can write an equation for the number of green Brussels sprouts as follows:

Number of green Brussels sprouts = 6 x 10 = 60

Now, let's add up the total number of Brussels sprouts in all 10 baskets:

Total number of Brussels sprouts = Number of red Brussels sprouts + Number of green Brussels sprouts
= 40 + 60
= 100

Therefore, there are 100 Brussels sprouts in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 green grapes in the basket, and we also know that there are more than twice as many yellow grapes as green ones (i.e., 60 yellow grapes). Therefore, if we divide the total number of grapes in the basket by the number of green grapes, we will get an estimate of how many more green grapes there are than red grapes:

Total number of grapes = 6 + 60 + 2 = 78
Number of green grapes = 6
Number of red grapes = Total number of grapes - Number of green grapes = 78 - 6 = 72
Therefore, there are more than 72 red grapes in the basket for every 6 green grapes. So, the answer to the question is: More than 12 red grapes."
Response:  If Jerry had 4 figures on his shelf initially and then added more action figures later, we can assume that he has a total of 8 figures now (as mentioned in the question). So, if he had 4 initial figures, he must have added 4 + x where x is the number of additional figures he added. Therefore, the answer is 4 + x = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Thus, Jerry added 4 additional action figures to his collection.
Response:  At first, Jerry had x figureks on his shelf. Later, he added 7 more figures. So, now there are x + 7 figureks on the shelf. Since Jerry said that there are 10 figureks in total, we can set up the equation: x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Jerry started with 3 figureks on his shelf and later added 7 more, making a total of 10 figureks.
Response:  Jerry had 4 figures initially and later added 6 more to his collection. So, in total he has 10 figures (4 + 6). Therefore, there were 10 action figures on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  Jerry had 5 figures and 9 books initially. So he has a total of 14 items (5 + 9 = 14) in his room. Later, he added 7 more figures to the shelf, so now he has a total of 21 items (14 + 7 = 21). Since we know that there are more figures than books, this means that the number of figures is greater than the number of books. Therefore, the number of figures on the shelf is 21 - 9 = 12.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 figurines and 10 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more figurines to the shelf. So, now he has 6 figurines in total (2 + 4 = 6). Now, let's count how many books are left on the shelf after adding new figurines. Initially, Jerry had 10 books, which means that after adding 4 new figurines, there are only 6 books left on the shelf (10 - 4 = 6). Therefore, the number of books on Jerry's shelf is 6.
Response:  Jerry had 8 figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, in total, there are 8 + 9 = 17 books on Jerry's shelf now.
Response:  Jerry had 7 figures and 2 books initially. Later, he added 4 more books to his shelf. So, now he has 7 + 2 = 9 items in total. Since we know that there are more figures than books, let's assume that each book takes up half of a space (since they are placed side by side). Therefore, if Jerry has x figures, then he has 2x spaces available for books. Now, since Jerry added 4 new books, he gained 4 spaces for books. So, after adding those 4 books, Jerry has 2x - 4 = 3 spaces left for additional figures or books. In other words, Jerry can accommodate at most 3 more figures or books on his shelf.  Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  Jerry had 5 figures and 2 books initially. Later, he added 9 more books to his shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 5 + 2 = 7 items on his shelf. Now, let's compare this number with the number of figureks. Jerry had 5 figureks initially, which means that there are 5 - 1 (books) = 4 figureks left after adding the books. Therefore, there are 4 figureks less than the number of books on Jerry's shelf. In other words, Jerry has 7 - 4 = 3 more books than figureks on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 figures on his shelf ( half). Then he added 4 new ones and removed 5 old ones. So, in total there were 17 figures on the shelf after that (8 + 4 - 5 = 17).
Response:  Jerry had 3 figures initially and later added 4 more, so there are now 7 figures in total (3 + 4 = 7). Then he removed some old ones, but we don't know how many. So, if there are 6 figures left on the shelf, that means Jerry took away x number of figures from the initial 7. Therefore, the answer is x = 1.
Response:  Jerry had 7 figures in his room initially. Then he added some action figures and removed 10 old ones. So, if there are now 8 figures on the shelf, that means Jerry added 8 - 7 = 1 new figure. Therefore, Jerry added one new action figure to his collection.
"Response:  At first, Jerry had some figurines on his shelf. Later, he added two new figurines and removed seven old ones from the shelf. If there are currently ten figurines on the shelf, then at the beginning there were:

$$ \begin{align\*} 10 - 7 &= 3 \\ 3 + 2 &= 5 \end{align\*} $$
So, there were five figurines on the shelf at the beginning."
Response:  We know that Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf initially and then added 7 more later. So, in total, he has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on his shelf now.  We are also given that Jerry has 10 books on his shelf initially. Therefore, the number of action figures Jerry has is greater than the number of books he has by 16 - 10 = 6.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 figures on his shelf. So, there were 3 + 4 = 7 items in total. Later, he added two more figures to the shelf, so now there are 7 + 2 = 9 items in total. Therefore, there are 9 - 3 = 6 additional figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 figures on his shelf. So, there were 10 items in total (books + figures). Then, he added two more figures to the shelf, so now there are 12 items in total (books + figures). Since we know that the number of books is constant at 7, the number of figures must have increased from 3 to 5 (since Jerry added 2 new figures). Therefore, the number of books on the shelf is still 7, but the number of figures has increased from 3 to 5. So, the correct answer is: Books = 7 Figures = 5
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 birds sitting on the fence (Dwa ptaki siedziały na płocie). Then, some other birds joined them (Dołączyłdo kilku innych ptaków). So, the total number of birds on the fence is:  Initially, there were 2 birds + New birds = Total number of birds on the fence. Therefore, the answer is:  Total number of birds on the fence = 2 + x = 8.
Response:  At first, there were five birds sitting on the branch (initial state). Then four more birds joined them (state after addition). So, in total, there are now ten birds (final state): 5 + 4 = 10.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 penguins and 46 seagulls sitting on the board. Then, 6 other birds joined them. So, the total number of birds sitting on the board is: 4 + 46 = 50 birds. Therefore, 50 birds are sitting on the board.
Response:  We have three penguins and two storks already sitting on the board. If five other birds join them, then we will have:  Three penguins + Two storks = Five birds Total number of birds = 8 birds And so, there are eight birds (including the penguins and storks) who sit on the board.
Response:  We have 3 penguins and 4 cranes sitting on a board. If we add two more birds to the group, then there will be 5 birds in total (including the original three penguins). So, there are more bird than cranes sitting on the board. Therefore, the correct answer is: More birds than cranes sit on the board.
Response:  We have two birds and six cranes sitting on the board. If three more birds join them, then there will be... (2 + 6) × 3 = 18 birds in total that are sitting on the board. Therefore, there are 18 birdies sitting on the board.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 bociani sitting on the log. Then, two more yellowhammers joined them. So, in total, we have: 6 + 2 = 8 bociani sitting on the log. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 3 penguins and 4 cranes sitting on a board. Then 6 more cranes join them. So, finally, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds and cranes sitting on the board.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 pigeons and 3 cranes sitting on the board. Then, two turtles joined them. So, now we have: Pigeons = 6 + Turtles = 2 = 8 birds Total number of birds = 8 Now, let's count how many cranes are still sitting on the board: Cranes = Initially 3 - Joined by 2 new ones (turtles) = 3 - 2 = 1 Therefore, the total number of birds sitting on the board is 8, and the number of cranes is 1.
Response:  We have four birds and three storks initially. Then six more storklets join them. So, the total number of storks is: 4 + 3 = 7 storks. Therefore, there are seven storks that sit on the pole.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 eagles sitting on the board. Then, 4 birds and 8 storks joined them. So, in total, how many birds are sitting on the board now?  The answer is 6 + 4 + 8 = 18 birds.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the board initially (2). Then five more birds join them (5 + 2 = 7). Finally, four bats join them (4), so in total there are 7 + 4 = 11 birds sitting on the board. Therefore, there are more birds than bats sitting on the board.
Response:  We have 3 initial birds sitting on the board. Then, we add another 2 birds and 6 storks. So, in total, there are 5 new birds that sit on the board (2 + 6 = 8). Therefore, there are 8 birds in total, including the original 3 birds, which means there are 5 storks (8 - 3 = 5) that sit on the board.
Response:  We know that five beavers and three birds were already sitting on the log. If four more birds join them, then there will be... (5 + 3) + 4 = 12 birds in total sitting on the log. So, there are more birds than beavers.
Response:  We have 6 bocianie (bociani) and 2 birds sitting on the board (ptaki). If three other birds join them, then we will have in total: 6 + 2 = 8 birds sitting on the board. So there are 8 bocianeks (bocianki) that sit on the board.
Response:  We have 3 penguins sitting on a board and then 6 cranes join them. So, in total we have 3 + 6 = 9 birds sitting on the board. Therefore, there are 9 cranes that sit on the board.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:  Number of pages in the first chapter - Number of pages in the second chapter = 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, there are 37 additional pages in the first chapter compared to the second chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter, we get:  80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages. The first chapter has 60 pages, so we can write it as follows: Chapter 1 = 60 pages. Now let's find out how many pages are in the second chapter. Since there are 93 pages in total, and one chapter has 60 pages, then the other chapter must have pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is: Chapter 2 = pages.
Response:  We know that the book has two chapters and the second chapter has 36 pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in second chapter Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of pages in first chapter = 67 - 36 = 31 pages So, the first chapter has 31 pages.
Response:  First chapter has 66 pages, second chapter has 35 pages, and third chapter has 24 pages. Therefore, total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. So, the entire book has 125 pages.
Response:  First chapter has 91 pages, second chapter has 23 pages, and third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, there are 68 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the book has 3 chapters and each chapter has a certain number of pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, if the first chapter has 35 pages, the second chapter has x pages (where x is the difference between 35 and 18), and the third chapter has y pages (where y is the difference between 18 and 3). Now, we can write an equation based on this information: Total Number of Pages = 35 + x + y Where x and y are the unknown values we want to find. Substituting the given values for x and y, we get: Total Number of Pages = 35 + x + y 3 = 35 + x + y - 3 Since there are 3 pages less than the total number of pages, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: Total Number of Pages = 35 + x + y - 3 3 = 32 + x + y - 3 Solving for x and y, we get: x = 10 y = 5 Therefore, the second chapter has 10 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  First chapter has 53 pages, second chapter has 75 pages and third chapter has 21 pages. So total number of pages in first chapter is 53 + 75 = 128 pages. Now we need to find out how many more pages are there in first chapter than in third chapter. Third chapter has 21 pages, so total number of pages in third chapter is 21 x 1 = 21 pages. Therefore, difference between number of pages in first chapter and third chapter is 128 - 21 = 107 pages. So, first chapter has 107 more pages than third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1891 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the book has 2 chapters with a total of 23 pages. Since the first chapter has 10 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in the second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the first chapter = 23 - 10 = 13 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 10 pages.
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter has 81 pages in total. Therefore, Chapter 1 has 81 pages. Now, we know that Chapter 2 has 68 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages of Chapter 1 from the total number of pages of the book, we get the number of pages of Chapter 2:  Number of pages of Chapter 2 = Total number of pages - Number of pages of Chapter 1 = 2 x 81 - 81 = 68 Thus, the second chapter has 68 pages.
Response:  We know that 62 people went for rowing in the morning and 39 people went for rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 62 People x Rowing (Morning) Afternoon = 39 People x Rowing (Afternoon) Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many more people went for rowing in the morning than in the afternoon: Number of people who went for rowing in the morning - Number of people who went for rowing in the afternoon = 62 - 39 = 23 Therefore, there were 23 more people who went for rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 52 obozowiczów went fishing in the morning and 61 of them went fishing in the afternoon. So, we can write down an equation: 52 + 61 = x, where x is the number of obozowiczów who went fishing in both the morning and the afternoon. Now, we need to find out how many more obozowiczów went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning. To do this, we subtract the number of obozowiczów who went fishing in the morning from the total number of obozowiczów who went fishing in both the morning and the afternoon: x - 52 = 61. Solving for x, we get: x = 73. Therefore, there were 73 obozowiczów who went fishing in both the morning and the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 15 obozowiczów went fishing early in the morning and then other people went fishing later in the day. So, we can say that the total number of obozowiczów who went fishing = 15 + (other people who went fishing later). Since we don't have any information about how many people went fishing after lunchtime, let's assume that they were equal in number to those who went fishing before lunchtime. Therefore, the total number of obozowiczów who went fishing = 15 + (other people who went fishing later) = 15 + 32 = 47 obozowiczów went fishing that day.
Response:  We know that some campers left early and at 7 pm. If in total, 60 campers went fishing that day, then how many of them went fishing in the morning?  Therefore, the answer is 30 (60 - 30 = 30).
"Response:  We know that there were 36 people who went for a swim in the morning, 13 in the afternoon and 49 in the evening. So, altogether we have:

36 + 13 + 49 = 108

Therefore, the total number of people who went for a swim is 108."
"Response:  We know that there were 44 people who went for a swim in the morning and 39 people who did so in the afternoon. Therefore, we can say that the difference between the number of people who went for a swim in the morning and those who did so in the afternoon is:

$$ \text{Number of people who went for a swim in the afternoon} - \text{Number of people who went for a swim in the morning} = 39 - 44 = -5 $$
So, there were 5 more people who went for a swim in the evening than in the morning."
Response:  We know that 53 obozowiczów were sailing in the morning, and 48 were sailing in the afternoon. So, there are more obozowiczów sailing in the morning than in the evening. The difference between these two numbers is 53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more obozowiczów sailing in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 33 boats sailed in the morning and 34 boats sailed in the afternoon. So, there are more boats sailing in the afternoon than in the morning. Now we need to find out how many more boats sail in the afternoon compared to the evening. According to the information given in the question, only 10 boats sailed in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of boats sailing in the afternoon and the evening is 24 (34 - 10). So, there are 24 more boats sailing in the afternoon than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 13 people went fishing in the morning and 59 people went fishing after noon. So, altogether 72 people went fishing (13 + 59 = 72). Therefore, the answer is 72.
"Response:  We know that 29 people went fishing in total and 66 people went upstream. Afterward, 26 people went fishing after noon. To find out how many more people went fishing in the morning than after noon, we need to subtract the number of people who went upstream from both groups:

Morning (before noon): 29 - 66 = -37
After noon: 26
So, there were 37 fewer people who went fishing in the morning than after noon."
Response:  We know that 41 people went fishing in the morning and 4 more went upstream in the morning as well. Therefore, there were 45 people who went out to fish or travel in the morning. In the afternoon, 26 people went fishing again, so the total number of people who went out for fishing or traveling was 71 (45 + 26).
"Response:  We know that 46 obozowiczów went fishing in one day and 43 of them went fishing early in the morning. So, we have:

Number of obozowiczów who went fishing early = 43
Total number of obozowiczów = 46

Now, let's find out how many obozowiczów went fishing after noon:

Number of obozowiczów who went fishing after noon = Total number of obozowiczów - Number of obozowiczów who went fishing early
= 46 - 43
= 3

Therefore, three obozowiczów went fishing after noon."
Response:  If Rachel collected 4 jabłki from her tree and the tree had initially 7 jabłek, then there were 3 jabłki left on the tree after she collected them (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are still 3 jabłki on the tree.
Response:  Initially, there were four apples on the tree. If Rachel picked some of them and now there are still two apples left on the tree, then we can conclude that Rachel picked three apples. So, Rachel picked 3 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 7 mature apples from her tree and now there are only 5 left on the tree. If 3 of them are mature and the remaining 2 are immature, then we can conclude that the number of immature apples is equal to the total number of apples minus the number of mature ones. Therefore, the number of immature apples on the tree is:  5 - 3 = 2. So, there are 2 immature apples left on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected two ripe apples from the tree initially. If there were originally 7 apples on the tree and 6 of them are now ripe, then the number of unripe apples must be equal to the number of ripe apples minus the number of apples collected by Rachel. Therefore, the number of unripe apples = 7 - 2 = 5. So, there were 5 dojrzałych jabłek na drzewie na początku.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 6 dojrzałe jabłki from her tree initially. Then she picked 3 more dojrzałe jabłki, so now we have 6 + 3 = 9 dojrzałe jabłki in total. After that, she picked 2 more dojrzałe jabłki, leaving us with 9 - 2 = 7 dojrzałe jabłky. Finally, there are 4 niedojrzałe jabłka remaining, which means that initially there were 7 + 4 = 11 jabłek on the tree. Therefore, the initial number of jabłek on the tree was 11.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 3 ripe apples from the tree initially. Then, she picked 2 more ripe apples and left 27 unripe ones on the tree. So, the total number of ripe apples on the tree at first was 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the initial number of ripe apples on the tree was 5.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 7 jabłek from her tree. Then, two new jabłka grew on the tree. So, after that, there were 7 + 2 = 9 jabłek on the tree. Finally, it is said that there are still 6 jabłek left on the tree. Therefore, at the beginning, Rachel had 7 jabłek, and then 2 more grew, so the total number of jabłek was 7 + 2 = 9.
Response:  We know that initially there were two apples on the tree (Na drzewie Rachel były dwa jabłka). Then, Rachel picked four apples from the tree (Zbierała cztery jabłka z drzewa). After that, three new apples grew on the tree (Potem na drzewie wyrosły trzy nowe jabłka). So, the total number of apples on the tree is equal to the initial number plus the ones picked minus the ones that grew (Ilze jabłek na drzewie = 2 + 4 - 3 = 6). Therefore, there are six apples on the tree now.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two apples from one of her trees, so there are now five fewer apples on that tree (since she took two). Then, we learn that there are still seven apples on the other tree. So, if the total number of apples Rachel had was 52, and she picked two from one tree, then the remaining apples must have been on the other tree. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Rachel has collected 8 jabłki from each of the three trees, so she has collected in total 8 x 3 = 24 jabłki. Now we are told that the trees have in total 9 jabłek, which means that there must be one jabłek left on each tree. So, the number of jabłki on each tree is 1. Therefore, the total number of jabłki on all three trees is 3 x 1 = 3.
Response:  We know that Rachel has collected 4 apple cores and each tree had 7 apples. So, in total, she has collected 4 x 7 = 28 apples. Therefore, there are still 1 apple left on the trees, which means Rachel has collected 28 + 1 = 29 apples.
"Response:  We know that Ed had two more bullets than Doug initially. So if Ed has x bullets and Doug has x -2 bullets, then after Doug lost some bullets on the playground, he had x -3 bullets left. Now we are told that Ed has 19 more bullets than Doug. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (x-3) = 19
Simplifying the equation:
2x = 16
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 8
So Doug lost 3 bullets on the playground."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles, then Doug had x - 10 marbles.  Now, we are told that Doug lost 11 marbles on the playground. Therefore, the number of marbles that Doug had after losing them is:

x - 10 = (x - 10) - 11

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 35

So, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, who had 35 marbles in total."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 22 balls and Doug lost 7 balls on the playground, then Doug must have started with x fewer balls than Ed. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Ed = x + 6
Doug = x - 7
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add Equation (1) and Equation (2):

Ed + Doug = 22 + 7
x + x - 7 = 22 + 7
2x = 30
x = 15
So, Doug had 15 balls less than Ed at first."
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more balls than Doug, so Ed had 27 - 5 = 22 balls and Doug had 22 + 3 = 25 balls. Therefore, Doug had 5 more balls than Ed.
"Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug initially. So if Ed had x marbles and Doug had y marbles, then after Ed lost some marbles, he had less than x marbles, and Doug had y marbles. Then, when Doug lost some marbles, he had fewer marbles than Ed. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:
x - 24 = y + 27 (1)
Since Ed found 9 marbles, we can add them to his total:
x = x + 9 (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for x, we get:
x = 30 (from Equation (2))
y = 26 (from Equation (1))
So Ed had 30 marbles more than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug initially (Ed had 29 more marbles). Then, Ed lost 17 marbles at the playground. So, how many marbles did Ed have left after losing those at the playground? Well, if he had 29 more marbles than Doug to start with, and then lost 17, that means he had 29 + 17 = 46 marbles left. Therefore, Ed had 46 marbles more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 20 marbles and Doug had 5 marbles, then Ed lost 3 marbles (since he had 19 more). Therefore, Ed has 17 marbles left now (20 - 3 = 17). Since Ed still has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing some, we can conclude that Doug has 9 marbles left (17 - 8 = 9).
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more balls than Doug. So, if Doug had x balls, then Ed had x + 30 balls.  When Ed lost 21 balls on the playground, he had x - 21 balls left. Now we are asked how many more balls Ed had than Doug. To find this difference, we can subtract the number of balls Ed lost from the total number of balls he had before losing them: x - 21 = (x + 30) - 21. Solving for x, we get x = 71. Therefore, Ed had 71 more balls than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 17 balls and lost 20, then Doug must have had 5 less balls than Ed at first (since they started with an equal number of balls). Therefore, Doug had 12 - 5 = 7 balls initially.
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding pureed carrots and only 42 suggested adding bacon to the menu, then there are more students who suggested pureed carrots than those who suggested bacon. Therefore, we can say that 96% of the students (408/42) preferred pureed carrots over bacon.
"Response:  If 479 students suggested adding pureed carrots and 489 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then there are more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested pureed carrots. So, we can say that x (the number of students who suggested bacon) is greater than y (the number of students who suggested pureed carrots). Now, we know that x + y = 968 (since there were 968 students in total), so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 968...(1)

Now, we have two equations based on the information given in the question:

x > y...(2)

From equation (1), we can see that x + y = 968, which means that x + y - y = 968 - y. Substituting y from equation (2), we get:

x + y - y = 968 - y

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 509

So, there were 509 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu, while there were fewer than 509 students who suggested adding pureed carrots."
Response:  We know that 310 students were asked for their suggestions and 185 of them suggested adding pureed carrots to the menu. So, there are 310 - 185 = 125 students who did not suggest adding pureed carrots. Now, we need to find out how many of these 125 students suggested adding beef to the menu. To do this, we can divide 125 by 3 (since there are 3 options: pureed carrots, beef, or neither) and get an estimate of 41 students who suggested adding beef. Therefore, the answer is 41.
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 suggested adding beef to the menu and 105 did not suggest any specific food item. Therefore, the number of students who suggested pureed carrot is 105 - 264 = -159. So, none of the students suggested pureed carrot as an option for lunch.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding pureed carrots and 63 students suggested adding bacon, then there are 457 + 63 = 520 suggestions for adding pureed carrots. Since some of these students may have also suggested other options, we can assume that at least half (i.e., 520 / 2) of the total number of suggestions were for adding pureed carrots. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is equal to the total number of suggestions minus the number of suggestions for adding pureed carrots, which is 520 - 261 = 259. So, 259 students suggested adding bacon.
Response:  If 182 students suggested adding puree and 166 students suggested adding beef, then there are 182 + 166 = 348 students who gave suggestions. Since only one suggestion can be chosen, some of these students must have suggested both puree and beef. So, the number of students who suggested beef is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who suggested puree. Therefore, the number of students who suggested beef is 348 - 182 = 166.
Response:  If 324 students suggested adding pureed carrots to the menu, and 374 students suggested adding bacon, then there are altogether 698 students who took part in suggesting new food products (324 + 374 = 698). Finally, if 128 students suggested adding tomatoes, then the total number of students participating in the suggestion is equal to 698 + 128 = 826. Therefore, 826 students participated in the survey.
Response:  If 257 students suggested adding pureed carrots, and 97 of them preferred it over beef, then there are 34 more students who preferred pureed carrots than those who suggested beef (i.e., 97 - 257 = 34). So, the number of students who preferred pureed carrots is 34.
Response:  If 144 students suggested adding pureed carrots, and 79 students suggested adding tomatoes, then there are more students who suggested pureed carrots than those who suggested tomatoes. Therefore, more students bard
Response:  If 337 students suggested adding bacon to the menu and only 23 students suggested adding tomatoes, then more students (337 - 23 = 314) suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding tomatoes. Therefore, 314 students suggested adding bacon more than those who suggested adding tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 66 possible food options in total and 450 students suggested adding pureed carrots to the menu. So, if we subtract the number of students who suggested adding beef (38), we get the number of students who did not participate in suggesting new products: 450 - 38 = 412. Therefore, 412 students participated in suggesting new products.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding pureed carrot and beef to the menu, that means there are 218 + 351 = 579 students who did not suggest adding pureed carrot and beef to the menu. Therefore, among the remaining 579 students, 351 students (60.4%) suggested adding only beef to the menu.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding beef and 76 students suggested adding tomatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding beef than those who suggested adding tomatoes (269 > 76).  Therefore, more students bard
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls in the school and 236 boys. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls in the school and 841 boys. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the number of boys: 841 - 34 = 796. So, there are 796 more boys than girls in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in total and 228 more girls than boys. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we get:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 697 - 228 = 469 boys Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) = 635 + (510 - 635) = 475 Therefore, there are 475 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 girls in the school and 587 boys. So, if there are 281 more girls than boys, then the total number of students in the school is:  Number of girls = 868 + (281 - 587) = 868 + (-294) = 574  Therefore, there are 574 students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls in school and 142 more boys than girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) = 700 + (142 - 700) = 568. Therefore, there are 568 students in this school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in school. Then, 418 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 706 + 418 = 1124 girls In total, therefore, there are currently 1124 students in this school - 222 boys and 1124 girls.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls are currently in this school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 girls In total, there are currently 1097 girls in the school, which is more than the number of boys (410). Therefore, the number of girls in the school exceeds the number of boys by 687 - 410 = 277.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in school. Then, 682 girls joined the school, so now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 732 + 682 = 1414 girls are currently in this school. Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in the school and 135 girls. So, the total number of students was 214 + 135 = 349. Then, 496 girls joined the school, so the total number of girls became 349 + 496 = 845. Similarly, when 910 boys joined the school, the total number of boys became 845 + 910 = 1755. Therefore, there are currently 1755 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls in the school and 318 boys. Therefore, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Since there are 36 teachers, we can divide the number of students by the number of teachers to find out how many students each teacher teaches: 626 / 36 = 17.5 students per teacher. So, there are approximately 17.5 students per teacher in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of students to teachers is 624 / 772 = 0.83. Therefore, there are approximately 83% of students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 402 more girls than boys in this school. So if there are 739 girls, then there must be 337 boys (since 739 - 402 = 337). Therefore, there are 337 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 458 girls, then there must be fewer boys. Let's assume that there are x boys in the school. Since there are 692 girls, we can set up the equation:  Number of girls = x + 458. Now, we want to find out how many students are in the school. We know that the total number of girls plus boys is equal to the total number of students. Therefore, we can write: x + (x + 458) = 1350 (since there are 1350 students in total). Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 458 = 1350. Subtracting 458 from both sides gives us: 2x = 892. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 446. Therefore, there are 446 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in school. Then, 403 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls = 362 + 403 = 765 Therefore, there are more girls than boys in this school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left now.
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, he must have spent $10 ($13 - $3 = $10). Therefore, Edward spent $10.
Response:  Edward had $9 initially and then he spent $8 more. So now he has $17. To find out how much he had before spending $8, we can subtract $8 from his current amount of money: $17 - $8 = $9. Therefore, Edward had $9 initially.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and each book cost him the same amount of money. So, he spent $16 / 92 = $0.18 per book. Since he has $6 left after buying the books, we can calculate how many books he bought as follows: Number of books = Total amount left ($6) / Cost per book ($0.18) = 6 x $0.18 = 10 books Therefore, Edward bought 10 books.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 on two books and each book cost him the same amount of money. So, if one book costs x dollars, then the other book must also cost x dollars. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Book 1 = x Book 2 = x Now, we are told that Edward has $12 left after buying the two books. This means that the total cost of both books is equal to $12. So, we can set up another equation: Book 1 + Book 2 = $12 Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: x + x = $12 Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = $12 Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = $6 So, each book cost $6.
Response:  Before he spent money on books and receipts, Edward had $20 (19 + 1). So, he spent $6 on books and $16 on receipts.
Response:  Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens. So he has $4 + $3 = $7 left after buying those items. Now he has $7 + $12 = $19. Therefore, Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens.
Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on notebooks, so he had $16 + $8 = $24 left after buying those items. Now he has $19, which is more than $24, so he must have bought something else recently that cost less than $19 - $24 = $5. Therefore, Edward spent $5 on books.
Response:  Edward had $17 initially and then received $10 from his friend. So he now has $27 ($17 + $10). Then he spent some money, so he has $7 left. Therefore, Edward had $17 when he first got the money.
Response:  Zachary did 44 pumps at school today and David did more than that, so he did 58 - 44 = 14 more pumps than Zachary. Therefore, they together did 44 + 14 = 58 pumps.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 pompeks and David made 44 pompki. To find out how many times Zachary did more than David, we need to divide the number of pompeks Zachary made by the number of pompki David made:  Number of times Zachary did more = (Number of pompeks Zachary made) / (Number of pompki David made) = (51) / (44) = 1.136... or approximately 1.2 times. So, Zachary did about 1.2 times more pompeks than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 pumps today and he made 9 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary made x pompes, then we can write an equation as follows:  David made 44 + 9 = 53 pompes. Therefore, Zachary made 53 - 9 = 44 pompes.
Response:  We know that David made 51 pompki today and Zachary made 49 more than him. So, Zachary made 51 + 49 = 100 pompki in total. Therefore, David and Zachary together made 51 + 100 = 151 pompki.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 pompki and 44 push-ups during his classes. David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, but he did 27 fewer than Zachary. So, if we subtract 27 from 19, we get 7. Therefore, David did 7 push-ups more than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 pompki and 17 приcisков. David made 29 more pompki than Zachary, which means he made 63 pompki in total (44 + 29 = 73). However, David also made fewer приcisков than Zachary, which means he made 10 приcisков in total (17 - 3 = 10). So, David performed 10 times as many приcisков as Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 sit-ups.  David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary but fewer sit-ups. So, if David did x push-ups, he did (x - 10) sit-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 53 + 14 = 67 push-ups and sit-ups.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 pull-ups during his workout at the gym. David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary but 87 fewer pull-ups than him. So, we can write an equation to represent this information as follows:
Zachary = 35 (push-ups) + 3 (pull-ups)
David = Zachary + 58 (push-ups) - 87 (pull-ups)
Now, let's solve for Zachary's number of pull-ups. We know that David did 87 fewer pull-ups than Zachary, so we can subtract 87 from David's total:
David = Zachary + 58 (push-ups) - 87 (pull-ups) = 35 + 58 - 87 = 10
So, Zachary did 10 pull-ups during his workout. Therefore, he did 35 push-ups and 10 pull-ups."
Response:  We know that Zachary made 46 pompeks and 58 button clicks during the lessons.  David did 38 more pompeks than Zachary but fewer than him in terms of button clicks (62). So, if we subtract the number of button clicks that David did from the total number of button clicks Zachary did, we will get the number of button clicks Zachary made. Therefore, the answer is:  Button Clicks = 58 - (38 + 62) = 58 - 100 = -42 button clicks.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 19 pompki at school today. David made more than Zachary, so David made x pompki. Since John made fewer pompki than David, we can say that John made y pompki less than David. Now, we are given that David made 39 more pompki than Zachary, which means that David made 39 + 19 = 58 pompki in total. So, David made 58 pompki at school today.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 pompeks during classes today. David made 73 pompeks (22 more than Zachary). So, we can write this as follows:  David - 51 = 73. Now, we know that John did 4 fewer pompeks than David. Therefore, we can write this as follows:  John - 4 = x, where x is the number of pompeks that John made. Solving for x, we get:  x = 69. So, John made 69 pompeks during classes today.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 15 pompki during classes and David made 39 more than Zachary. So, David made 39 + 15 = 54 pompki. Now we know that John made 9 fewer pompki than David. Therefore, David made x pompki, where x is equal to 54 minus 9 = 45. Since Zachary did not make as many pompki as John, we can say that Zachary made y pompki, where y is less than or equal to 45. In other words, Zachary made at most 45 pompki.  Therefore, the answer is: Zachary made at most 45 pompki.
Response:  We know that David made 30 more pompoms than Zachary at the lessons. So, if David made 37 pompoms, then Zachary made 37 - 30 = 7 pompoms.
Response:  We know that David made 56 more pompoms than Zachary. So if David made 38 pompoms, then Zachary made 18 pompoms (56 - 38 = 18). Therefore, David and Zachary together made 38 + 18 = 56 pompoms.
Response:  We know that David made 40 more pompkins than Zachary and 17 fewer than Zachary on their activities. So, if Zachary did 34 pompkins and 62 buttonholes, then David did 34 + 40 = 74 buttonholes.
Response:  We know that David made 36 more pompkins than Zachary and 33 fewer than Zachary on their assignments. So, if Zachary made 58 pompkins and 33 push-ups, how many more pompkins did Zachary make than push-ups?  To find out, we can subtract the number of push-ups from the total number of pompkins: 58 - 33 = 25. Therefore, Zachary made 25 more pompkins than push-ups.
Response:  We know that David made 27 more pompkins than Zachary and 7 fewer than Zachary on their assignments. So, if Zachary made 5 pompkins and 17 push-ups, how many more push-ups did he make than pompkins?  To find out, we can subtract the number of pompkins from the total number of exercises:  Push-ups = Total exercises - Pompkins  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Push-ups = 34 - 20  = 14  Therefore, Zachary made 14 more push-ups than pompkins.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, the total number of pages she had to complete is:  5 + 2 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had more pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  Rachel had to do 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, if she did 3 pages of math homework, that means she did 3 + x pages of reading homework, where x is the number of pages of math homework she did. Therefore, the number of pages of reading homework Rachel did is equal to 4 - x. Since we know that Rachel did 4 pages of reading homework in total, we can set up the equation: 4 - x = 3 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. So, Rachel did 1 page less of reading homework than math homework.
Response:  Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and additional pages of reading comprehension. If she completed 7 pages of her homework, then she must have completed x pages of reading comprehension. Since we know that total number of pages is equal to 12 (5 + x), we can set up an equation as follows:  5 = x + 7  Now, let's solve for x:  x = 5 - 7  x = -2 So, Rachel completed -2 pages of reading comprehension.
Response:  If Rachel had to fill out 7 pages of homework from mathematics and she filled out 4 more pages than from reading, then we can say that Rachel filled out 7 + 4 = 11 pages from mathematics. So, Rachel had to fill out 11 pages from mathematics and 4 pages from reading.
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of homework from mathematics and she completed 3 more pages than in reading, then we can say that:

Number of pages completed in mathematics = 8
Number of pages completed in reading = 3 + 8 = 11

So, Rachel had to complete 11 pages of homework in total."
"Response:  We know that Rachel completed 8 math problems and she had to complete more than 6 reading problems. So, let's assume that she completed x reading problems. Since there are 10 total problems (8 math + 2 reading), we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 10

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 8

x = 2

So, Rachel had to complete 2 reading problems."
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 10 math tasks and she completed 3 more reading tasks than math tasks, then...
Response:  Rachel had to complete 2 sides of a homework assignment from mathematics (2 x 5 = 10), 3 sides of a homework assignment from reading (3 x 4 = 12), and 10 more sides from her biology homework (10 x 6 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rachel had to complete 82 sides of her homework assignments (10 + 12 + 60 = 82).
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of homework from mathematics, 2 pages from reading comprehension, and 96 pages from biology. So, we can write an equation:

Mathematics = 9
Reading Comprehension = 2
Biology = 96

Now, let's solve for the number of pages in mathematics:

Mathematics = 9
Subtract Reading Comprehension:
Mathematics = 9 - 2 = 7

So, Rachel had to complete 7 more pages of homework from mathematics than she did from reading comprehension."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework, which means she completed 11/4 = 2.75 pages of math per subject. Since there are 3 subjects in total (math, reading, and biology), we can calculate the number of pages Rachel completed for each subject as follows:

Math: 2.75 pages x 3 subjects = 8.25 pages
Reading: 2 pages x 3 subjects = 6 pages
Biology: 0 pages x 3 subjects = 0 pages

Therefore, Rachel completed more pages of math homework than any other subject. The difference between the number of pages completed for math and biology is 8.25 - 0 = 8.25 pages. So, the answer is 8."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 7 strony from the math assignment, and 11 strony from the reading assignment. So far, we have:

Rachel completed 7 + 11 = 18 strony of assignments.
Now, let's find out how many strony she had to complete for biology. According to the question, she had to complete 8 more strony for biology than she did for reading. So, if she completed 11 strony for reading, then she had to complete:

8 - 11 = -3 strony for biology.
Therefore, Rachel had to complete -3 strony less for biology than she did for reading."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 strony of math homework, which means she had to solve 9 problems or tasks related to mathematics. Since each problem typically takes around 30 minutes to an hour to complete (depending on the complexity), we can estimate that Rachel spent approximately 9 x 60 = 540 minutes on her math homework. Now, let's move on to reading comprehension. We are told that Rachel had to complete 11 strony of reading comprehension homework, which means she had to read and understand 11 passages or texts. Each passage usually takes around 15-20 minutes to read and understand (again, depending on the complexity), so Rachel spent approximately 11 x 15 = 165 minutes on her reading comprehension homework. Finally, let's look at the biology homework. We are told that Rachel had to complete 29 strony of biology homework, which means she had to study and understand 29 concepts or topics related to biology. Each concept or topic usually takes around 30-45 minutes to learn and understand (depending on how complex it is), so Rachel spent approximately 29 x 30 = 870 minutes on her biology homework. In total, then, Rachel spent approximately 540 + 165 + 870 = 1575 minutes on all three types of homework combined.
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 8 stron from her math homework, and she completed 7 stron from her reading homework. So far, we have:
Mathematics: 8 stron
Reading: 7 stron
Now, let's find out how many stron Rachel had to complete from her biology homework. According to the question, she completed 3 strony from her biology homework. Therefore, we can add this value to our previous calculations:
Mathematics: 8 stron
Reading: 7 stron
Biology: 3 stron
So, in total, Rachel had to complete 18 stron (8 + 7 + 3) from her three subjects."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math, which means she had to solve 5/10 = 0.5 pages of math problems. Similarly, we know that she had to complete 10 pages of reading and 6 pages of biology, so she had to read for 10 - 2 = 8 pages and complete 6 pages of biology problems. Therefore, in total, Rachel had to complete 0.5 + 8 + 6 = 14 pages of work.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 2 more pages of reading comprehension than math problems. So if she did x pages of reading comprehension, then she would have done x + 2 = y pages of math problems. Since we are told that there were 4 math problems per page, this means that Rachel had to do y / 4 = z pages of math problems. Therefore, the answer is z > 0.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 4 sides of homework from reading and 7 sides from mathematics. So far so good! However, we also know that she did more pages in her math homework than in her reading homework. Therefore, we can conclude that Rachel did at least 7 + x = 26 pages of math homework, where x is the number of extra pages she did compared to her reading homework. Since we are told that she did 19 pages of reading homework, we can set up the equation as follows:  7 + x = 26  To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 19 Substituting this value back into our original equation gives us: 4 + 19 = 26 Which simplifies to: 23 = 26 This means that Rachel did 3 extra pages of math homework compared to her reading homework. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in total. Since he received 2 emails after lunchtime, we can subtract these from the total number of emails he received. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received before lunchtime is:  6 - 2 = 4 emails. So, Jack received 4 emails before lunchtime.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total emails = Morning emails + Afternoon emails
= 6 + 8
= 14

Therefore, Jack received 14 emails in total."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and several more in the afternoon. So, let's assume he received x emails in total during the day. Since we are told that he received 5 emails in total, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 5

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 5 - 4

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in addition to the 4 he received in the morning, so he received a total of 5 emails during the day."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime hours (morning + afternoon).  As for the evening, we are told that Jack received 5 emails then. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received in a day is:  9 + 5 = 14 emails.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in total.  So, he must have received at least 3 emails during the day (morning and afternoon). Therefore, we can conclude that Jack received 3 emails rano and 2 emails after noon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning, 5 emails at noon, and 8 emails in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of:

4 + 5 + 8 = 17 emails in one day."
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening. So he received a total of 11 emails (3 + 8 = 11). Therefore, Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning, and we want to find out how many he received in total. So, let's calculate it as follows:
Total number of emails = Number of emails received in the morning + Number of emails received at noon + Number of emails received in the evening
= 10 + 7 + 17
= 34
Therefore, Jack received 34 emails in total."
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in total. So, he must have received 3 emails at dawn (9 - 2 = 3). And we also know that he received 6 emails in the afternoon (10 - 2 = 6). Finally, he received 4 emails in the evening (7 - 2 = 4). Therefore, the number of emails Jack received rano is 3, and the number of emails he received wieczorno is 4.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon (which includes both before and after lunch). Therefore, he received a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails during the daytime hours (morning plus afternoon). Since we are asked how many emails Jack received ""po południu"", we can deduce that this refers to the number of emails he received between noon and the end of the day. So, the answer is:  Po południu Jack otrzymał 5 e-maili."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime hours (morning + afternoon).  However, we are also told that Jack received ""jeszcze kilka"" (meaning ""a few more"") emails in the evening, which means that he received at least a few more emails after the daytime hours. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is greater than or equal to 9.  So, the answer is 9 or more."
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So in total, he received 67 pieces of mail (3 emails + 64 letters). Then, in the afternoon, he received 5 more emails and 54 letters. Therefore, Jack received a total of 121 pieces of mail during the day (67 + 54 = 121).
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters, so he received in total 11 messages (5 emails + 6 letters).  Later in the day, he received 9 more emails and 7 more letters, for a total of 16 messages (9 emails + 7 letters) received that day. Therefore, Jack received a total of 16 messages during the day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. So, he received a total of 10 + 12 = 22 messages in the morning. Then, we are told that he received 3 more emails after lunchtime. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is 22 + 3 = 25 emails.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. Then he received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received:

6 + 8 = 14 letters in the morning
2 + 7 = 9 letters in the afternoon

Therefore, Jack received a total of 14 + 9 = 23 letters."
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 2 emails and sent 91 letters. So, he had an email exchange of 93 (2 emails received) - 91 letters sent = 2 emails per day. Then in the afternoon, Jack received 2 more emails and sent 74 letters. Therefore, he had an email exchange of 2 + 2 = 4 emails per day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack sent 2 emails and received 4 emails, so he sent a total of 2 + 4 = 6 emails in the morning.  Then, in the afternoon, Jack received 6 emails and sent 8 letters, so he sent a total of 6 + 8 = 14 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack sent a total of 6 + 14 = 20 emails during the day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in total and he received 7 emails before noon. So, the number of emails he received after noon is 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 emails after noon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails at noon, and then he received another 5 emails in the morning (not specified what time). So, we can conclude that Jack received a total of 8 emails during the daytime. Now, let's check how many emails Jack received in the evening: According to the question, Jack received 16 emails in the evening. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the number of hours between noon and evening as follows: Noon = 12 PM Evening = 8 PM Time difference = 6 hours Therefore, Jack received 8 emails in the evening.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails at noon, 6 emails in the morning, and several more in the evening. So, let's count how many emails he received during the day: Noon + Morning = 3 + 6 = 9 emails. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails during the day.
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skoczyła o 9 cali (or 9 inches).
Żaba skoczyła o 12 cali (or 12 inches).
We want to find out how far away from each other they are after their jumps.
So, we can calculate the distance between them as follows:
Distance = Żaba - Szarańcza
= 12 inches - 9 inches
= 3 inches
Therefore, żaba skakała o 3 cala (or 3 inches) further than szarańcza."
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the squirrel is 31 cm and the distance traveled by the frog is 35 cm. So, if we add these two distances together, we get: Distance = 31 + 35 = 66 cm. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both animals together is 66 cm.
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog (Szaranka) is 36 cm. The distance traveled by the toad (Zawisa) is 17 cm more than the distance traveled by the frog, so it is:  Distance = 36 + 17 = 53 cm.  Finally, we know that the mouse (Mysz) skated 15 cm less than the distance traveled by the toad, so its distance is:  Distance = 53 - 15 = 38 cm. Therefore, the distance traveled by the toad (Zawisa) is 38 cm.
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog (Szaranka) is 25 cm. The distance traveled by the toad (Zawisa) is 18 cm more than the distance traveled by the frog. So, the distance traveled by the toad is:  Zawisa = Szeranka + 18 = 43 cm. Now we need to find out how far the mouse (Mysz) jumped. We know that the distance traveled by the mouse is 2 cm less than the distance traveled by the toad. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is: Mysz = Zawisa - 2 = 41 cm. Therefore, the mouse jumped 41 cm.
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skaczył o 19 cali.
Żaba przeskoczył o 10 cali dalej niż szarańcza.
Mysz przeskoczył o 20 cali dalej niż żaba.
We can write this as an equation:
Szarańcza = 19
Żaba = 10 + x
Mysz = 20 - y
Where x and y are variables representing the distance traveled by the frog and mouse respectively.
Now we have three equations:
Szarańcza = 19
Żaba = 10 + x
Mysz = 20 - y
Can you solve for x and y using these equations?"
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skaczył o 19 cali.
Żaba przeskoczył o 39 cali dalej niż szarańcza.
Mysz o 94 cali niżej niż żaba.
From these statements, we can deduce that:
The distance traveled by the frog (żaba) is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the frog and the mouse (mysz).
So, the distance traveled by the frog is:
Distance = Distance traveled by frog + Distance traveled by mouse
= 19 + (-94)
= -75 cali
Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog is 75 cali."
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skoczyła o 25 cali.
Żaba przeskoczyła o 32 cali dalej niż szarańcza.
Mysz o 26 cali mniej niż żaba.
So we can write an equation based on these statements:
Distance traveled by mysz = distance traveled by żaba - (distance traveled by szarańcza + 26)
= 32 - (25 + 26)
= 32 - 51
= -19 cali
Therefore, mysz skaczył o 19 cali less than żaba."
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skaczył o 24 cali.
Żaba skoczyła o 33 cali dalej niż szarańcza.
Mysz skakała o 5 cali mniej niż żaba.
We can write this as an equation:
Szarańcza = 24
Żaba - Szarańcza = 33
Mysz - Żaba = -5
Now we need to solve for ""mysz"". Using the first two equations, we get:
Żaba - Szarańcza = 33
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
Żaba = Szarańcza + 33
Now we substitute the value of ""Szarańcza"" (which is 24) into the previous equation:
Żaba = 24 + 33
Żaba = 57
So mysz skakała o 57 cali dalej niż szarańcza."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 13 centimeters and the frog jumped further than the frog. So, if the frog jumped 13 centimeters, then the distance between the starting point of the frog and the point where it landed is equal to 13 centimeters plus the distance traveled by the frog after landing. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Distance = 13 + (Distance traveled by frog after landing) Now, we are given that the frog jumped further than the frog, so the distance traveled by the frog after landing is greater than zero. Let's call this distance x. Then, we can rewrite the equation as: Distance = 13 + x Substituting this value in the original equation, we get: 13 + x = 5x Now, simplifying the equation, we get: x = 4 Now, we know that the frog jumped 13 centimeters initially, so the total distance traveled by the frog including both initial displacement and final position is: Total distance = Initial displacement + Final position Total distance = 13 + 4 = 17 centimeters Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog was 17 centimeters.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 35 centimeters and the toad jumped 10 centimeters more than the frog. So, the total distance traveled by both of them together is: Distance = 35 + (10 - 3) = 48 centimeters. Therefore, they both jumped 48 centimeters together.
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skoczyła o 19 cali (or 48 cm).
Szarańcza skoczyła o 10 cm more than the distance traveled by the frog. So, the distance traveled by the frog is:
Frog's distance = Szarańcza's distance + 10 cm
= 48 cm + 10 cm
= 58 cm
We also know that the mouse skidded 15 cm less than the distance traveled by the frog. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is:
Mouse's distance = Frog's distance - 15 cm
= 58 cm - 15 cm
= 43 cm
So, the distance traveled by the frog was 58 cm and the distance traveled by the mouse was 43 cm. Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog was greater than the distance traveled by the mouse by 15 cm."
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog (Szaranka) is 39 cm and the distance traveled by the mouse (Mysz) is less than 12 cm. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Distance = S + M

Where ""S"" represents the distance traveled by the frog and ""M"" represents the distance traveled by the mouse.

We are also given that the distance traveled by the frog is greater than the distance traveled by the mouse. So, we can rewrite the above equation as:

Distance = S > M

Now, let's substitute the values we have been given into the equation:

Distance = 39 > 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Distance = 57

So, the mouse (Mysz) skated 57 cm away from the starting point."
Response:  We know that: * The distance traveled by the frog (Szaranka) is 21 cm more than the distance traveled by the mouse (Mysz). So, the distance traveled by the frog = 21 + x = 46 cm. * The distance traveled by the frog is 25 cm more than the distance traveled by the toad (Zaiba). So, the distance traveled by the frog = 46 + 25 = 71 cm. * The distance traveled by the mouse is 16 cm less than the distance traveled by the toad. So, the distance traveled by the mouse = 71 - 16 = 55 cm. Therefore, the distance between the frog and the mouse is 55 cm.
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog is 39 cm and the distance traveled by the grasshopper is 17 cm. To find out how much farther the frog went than the grasshopper, we can subtract their distances from each other :  Distance traveled by frog - Distance traveled by grasshopper = 39 - 17 = 22 cm  Therefore, the frog skated 22 cm farther than the grasshopper.
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skaczył o 9 cali (or 9 cm).
Mysz skoczyła o 10 cm less than Żaba.
Żaba skoczyła o 20 cm more than Szarańcza.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Distance = 9 cm + (10 - x) cm + (20 - y) cm
Where x is the distance traveled by the mysz and y is the distance traveled by the Żaba.
Now, we are given that the mysz skaczył o 30 cm. So, we can substitute this value in the above equation:
Distance = 9 cm + (10 - x) cm + (20 - y) cm = 30 cm
Solving for x, we get:
x = 40 cm
Therefore, the mysz skaczył o 40 cm."
"Response:  We know that:
Szarańcza skaczył o 14 cali.
Mysz skoczyła o 16 cali mniej niż żaba.
Żaba skoczyła o 37 cali dalej niż szarańcza.
We can write this as an equation:
Distance = 14 + (16 - x) + (37 - distance_of_żaba)
Where 'x' is the distance traveled by the mouse.
Now we have to solve for 'x'.
Given that the mouse skaczył o 16 cali mniej niż żaba, so:
distance_of_mouse = distance_of_żaba - 16
Substituting the value of distance_of_żaba from the problem:
distance_of_mouse = 37 - 16
= 21
So, the mouse skaczył o 21 cali dalej niż szarańcza."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar in the recipe.  Mary has already added 5 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount of flour needed:

14 - 5 = 9

So, Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour to complete the recipe. Similarly, we can calculate the number of cubes of sugar needed by subtracting the amount already added (6) from the total amount of sugar needed (6):

6 - 6 = 0

Therefore, Mary does not need to add any more cubes of sugar to the recipe."
Response:  We know that there are 9 spoonfuls of flour and 11 spoonfuls of sugar in the recipe. If she has already added 4 spoons of flour, then we have to add 5 more spoonfuls of flour (9 - 4 = 5). Now, if we subtract the number of spoonfuls of flour she has already added from the total number of spoonfuls of sugar, we get 11 - 5 = 6 additional spoonfuls of sugar that she needs to add. So, the final answer is 6 cubes of sugar more than the number of cubes of flour.
Response:  We know that there are currently 6 filiżanki of flour used and 13 filiżanki of sugar added. If Mary has already put in several cups of flour, then she needs 8 more filiżanki to use up all of the flour. Therefore, she will need to add 8 + 6 = 14 filiżanki of flour in total.
Response:  If there are already 6 cubes of flour used and Mary needs 2 more, then she will use 8 cubes in total (6 + 2 = 8). So, if the recipe calls for 11 cubes of flour, then Mary has used 3 (11 - 8 = 3) of them. Therefore, she still needs to use 8 cubes of flour (3 / 11 = 0.73).
"Response:  If Mary has already added 3 filiżanki of flour to the mixture and the recipe calls for 11 glasses of sugar and a few spoonfuls of flour, then we can calculate how much flour is left in the recipe as follows:

Total amount of flour needed = Number of glasses x Amount of flour per glass
= 11 x 200 grams (approximately)
= 2200 grams

Now, if Mary needs to add another 6 filiżanek (about 750 grams), she will have used up all the remaining flour in the recipe:

Used amount of flour = Total amount of flour needed - Remaining amount of flour after adding 3 filiżanki
= 2200 grams - 750 grams (from the previous calculation)
= 1450 grams

Therefore, Mary still needs to add 750 grams of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  If there are currently 6 cubes of flour used and the recipe calls for 12 cubes in total, then we know that Mary has already used half of the required amount of flour (6/12 = 0.5). To find out how many more cubes she needs to use, we can multiply the remaining amount by the number of cubes she has already used: 0.5 x 6 = 3. So, Mary still needs to use 3 additional cubes of flour.
Response:  We know that there are 9 filiżanki of flour in the recipe and Mary has already added 3 of them. So, we have 9 - 3 = 6 remaining filiżanki of flour to add. Similarly, we know that there are 5 filiżanki of sugar in the recipe and Mary has already added 62 of them. So, we have 5 - 62 = -57 filiżanki of sugar left to add (since negative numbers indicate the amount left to be added). Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more filiżanki of flour and -57 filiżanki of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 ml of flour and 14 g of sugar in each slice of cake.  If she has already added 10 ml of flour and 2 g of sugar, then we need to calculate how much more flour and sugar she needs to add to make another slice of cake.  To do this, we can use the following formula:

Flour needed = (Total amount of flour - Amount already added) / Number of slices
Sugar needed = (Total amount of sugar - Amount already added) / Number of slices

In this case, the total amount of flour is 5 x 14 = 70 grams, and the total amount of sugar is 14 x 5 = 70 grams. So, if she wants to make another slice of cake, she needs to add 70 - 10 = 60 grams of flour and 70 - 2 = 68 grams of sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 60 grams of flour and 68 grams of sugar to make another slice of cake."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 filiżanki of flour in total (as stated in the recipe).  Mary has already added 11 filiżanki of flour, so we have to subtract this amount from the total number of filiżanki of flour. Therefore, the remaining amount of flour needed is:

12 - 11 = 1

So, Mary needs to add one more filiżanka of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that there are 10 cups of flour in the recipe and we have already added 7 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour we need to add, we can subtract 7 from 10. Therefore, we need to add 3 more cups of flour (10 - 7 = 3).
Response:  We know that there are 12 cups of flour in total (as stated in the recipe), and we have already used 2 cups to prepare the first two filiżanki. Therefore, if we want to make another 9 filiżanki, we will need an additional amount of flour equal to 12 - 2 = 10 cups. Similarly, we know that there are 14 cups of sugar in total (as stated in the recipe) and 7 cups of salt (also as stated). So, to make these 9 filiżanki, we will need an additional amount of sugar equal to 14 - 2 = 12 cups, and salt equal to 7 - 2 = 5 cups.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 filiżanki of sugar and 7 filiżanki of salt in the recipe. Since Mary has already added 5 filiżanki of flour, she needs to add an additional amount of sugar equal to the number of filiżanki of flour she has added. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more filiżanki of sugar (since she has added 5 filiżanki of flour). Similarly, since there are 7 filiżanki of salt in the recipe, Mary needs to add 1 more filiżanka of salt (since she has already added 5 filiżanki of flour). So, the final answer is:  Sugar - 3 filiżanki; Salt - 1 filiżanka."
Response:  We know that there are 12 tablespoons of flour and 13 tablespoons of sugar in total.  Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of sugar, so we need to find out how many tablespoons she still needs to add.  To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of sugar (13 - 2 = 11) by the number of tablespoons left to be added (12). So, Mary needs to add 9 tablespoons of sugar more.
"Response:  We know that there are currently 6 filiżanki (or cubes) of sugar added to the mixture and we need to add 4 more cubes of flour. So far, we have:

* 9 filiżanek mąki (or cubes of flour) in the recipe
* 6 filiżanek cukru (or cubes of sugar) already added
* 4 filiżanki cukru (or cubes of flour) needed to be added

To find out how many total filiżanki (or cubes) of flour will be needed, we can divide the number of filiżanki of flour in the recipe by the number of filiżanki of flour already added:

9 filiżanek mąki / 6 filiżanek cukru = 1.5 filiżanki mąki per each filiżanka cukru

So, if we add 4 more filiżanki of sugar, we will need to add 4 x 1.5 = 6 filiżanki of flour. Therefore, the final answer is:

Mary needs to add 6 additional filiżanki of flour to the mixture."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour in the recipe.  Mary has already added 2 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

6 cups of sugar - 2 cups of flour = 4 cups of flour needed

So, Mary needs to add 4 more cubes of flour than cubes of sugar in the recipe."
Response:  We know that there are currently 11 filiżanki of flour used and we need to add more flour so that the total number of filiżanki is equal to 5 (candy) + 14 (flour). So, we need to find out how many additional filiżanki of flour we need to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour (14 - 11 = 3) by the number of filiżanki needed for each addition (5). Therefore, we need to add 6 more filiżanki of flour.
"Response:  If there are already several cubes of flour added and Mary needs 5 more, then she has used x amount of flour so far. Since there are 10 teaspoons of flour in each cube, we can write an equation:
x = (5/10) \* 10 = 5
So, Mary has used 5 teaspoons of flour so far. Now, let's find out how much sugar is needed:
Sugar required = Total amount of sugar / Amount of flour used
= 3 cups / 5 teaspoons
= 6 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 cups of sugar to make 3 cups of pie crust."
"Response:  If there are currently 6 cubes of flour used (as stated in the problem), and the recipe calls for 13 cubes of flour total, then we know that Mary has already used half of the total amount needed. To find out how many more cubes she needs to use, we can simply divide the remaining amount by 2:

Number of cubes left = Total amount - Used amount / 2
= 13 - 6 / 2
= 13 - 3
= 10

Therefore, Mary has used 10 cubes of flour so far."
Response:  We know that there are currently 7 filiżanki of flour used and 60 filiżanków of sugar used.  The recipe calls for 14 szklanek of flour and 6 szklanek of sugar. So we need to find out how many more filiżanki of flour Mary needs to add.  To do this, we divide the number of remaining filiżanków of sugar (60) by the amount of sugar in each filiżanka (6). This gives us 10 filiżanków of sugar left to use.  Now, let's check how much flour is left to use. We subtract the number of filiżanków of flour already used (7) from the total amount of flour needed (14): 14 - 7 = 7 filiżanków of flour left to use. Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more filiżanków of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 filiżanki of flour and 10 filiżanki of sugar to make the dough.  The recipe calls for 11 glasses of sugar and 9 glasses of flour. So we need to find out how many more glasses of sugar Mary needs to add.  To do this, we can divide the number of remaining glasses of sugar (11 - 12 = 1) by the number of glasses Mary has already added (10). This gives us the amount of additional sugar Mary needs to add: 1/10 = 0.1 or 10%. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 10% of the total amount of sugar required in the recipe, which is 11 / 100 = 0.11 or 1 glass of sugar.  Similarly, we can calculate the amount of flour needed by dividing the number of remaining glasses of flour (9 - 12 = -3) by the number of glasses Mary has already added (10): (-3)/10 = -0.3 or -30%. Therefore, Mary needs to subtract 30% of the total amount of flour required in the recipe, which is 9 x 0.7 = 6.3 glasses of flour. In summary, Mary needs to add 1 glass of sugar and subtract 6.3 glasses of flour.
Response:  We know that there are 3 cups of sugar (3 x 200 = 600 grams), 10 cups of flour (10 x 100 = 1000 grams), and 15 cups of salt (15 x 75 = 1125 grams) in total.  Since we have already added 6 filiżanki (about 180 grams) of flour, we need to add another 4 filiżanki (about 180 grams) of flour to make the pie crust. Therefore, we must add an additional 4 + 6 = 10 filiżanek (or about 260 grams) of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour in the recipe. Therefore, we need to add 5 cups of flour (since 14 - 4 = 10). So, we must add 5 more cubes of flour than cubes of sugar.
Response:  We know that there are 9 spoonfuls of sugar (filiżanki cukru), and we have already added 2 spoons of flour (filiżanka mąki). So, we need to find out how many more spoonfuls of flour do we need to add. To do this, we can divide the number of spoonfuls of sugar by the number of spoonfuls of flour that we have already added:  Number of spoonfuls of flour needed = Number of spoonfuls of sugar - Number of spoonfuls of flour already added  Number of spoonfuls of flour needed = 9 - 2 = 7 Therefore, we need to add 7 more spoonfuls of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that there are 11 cups of sugar in the recipe and 9 cups of flour. So far, Mary has filled 12 muffin tins with batter, which means she needs to add an additional 2 cups of flour (since each cup can make 4-5 muffins). Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour than sugar. Since there are 6 cups of flour in total, this means Mary needs to add 2/3 cups of flour (or 4.33 cups) more than sugar.
"Response:  We know that there are currently 4 filiżanki (or 1/5 of a cup) of sugar added to the mixture. To find out how much more sugar is needed, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of sugar = Original amount of sugar - Amount already added

In this case, the original amount of sugar was 7 szklanek (or 3/4 of a cup), and we have already added 4 filiżanki (or 1/5 of a cup). So, to find out how many more szklanek (or cups) of sugar are needed, we can subtract the amount already added from the total amount of sugar:

Number of additional szklanek = Total amount of sugar - Amount already added
= 7 szklanek - 4 filiżanki
= 3 szklanek

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 szklanek (or cups) of sugar to the mixture."
Response:  We know that there are 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour in the recipe.  Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the mixture. Therefore, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add to balance the amount of sugar with the amount of flour used. To do this, we can divide the number of cups of sugar (12) by the number of cups of flour (14) and multiply the result by the number of cups of flour Mary has already added (10): Number of additional cups of flour = (12 / 14) x 10 = 8 Additional cups of flour needed = 8 cups So, Mary needs to add 8 more cups of flour to the mixture to balance the amount of sugar with the amount of flour used.
"Response:  We know that 19 families of birds live near the mountain and 60 families of birds have migrated to warmer countries for winter. So, we can write an equation:

Number of families of birds remaining = 19
Total number of families of birds = 60 - 19 = 41
Now, let's find out how many more families of birds migrated than remained:
Difference between total number of families that migrated and those that remained = Total number of families that migrated - Number of families that remained = 41 - 19 = 22
So, there are 22 more families of birds that migrated than remained."
Response:  We know that most animals migrate to warmer countries during winter and only 87 families of birds remain near the mountain. If 7 bird families left for winter, then the number of bird families remaining nearby is:  87 - 7 = 80
Response:  We know that 20 families of birds migrated to warmer countries for winter and 14 families remained near the mountain. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain at the beginning was: Total = Number of remaining families + Number of migrating families = 14 + 20 = 34 families.
Response:  We know that most animals migrate to warmer countries as winter approaches and there are currently 85 families of birds near the mountain. If 23 families of birds flew to Africa and 37 families flew to Asia, then we can calculate how many families of birds remained nearby the mountain using the following formula: Number of bird families remaining = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that flew away. In this case, the total number of bird families is 85, and the number of bird families that flew away is 60 (23 + 37). Therefore, the number of bird families remaining nearby the mountain is: Number of bird families remaining = 85 - 60 = 25. So, there are 25 bird families remaining near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 42 families of birds flew to Africa and 31 families flew to Asia. So, we have:

Africa - 42 families = 42 x 8 = 336 birds
Asia - 31 families = 31 x 8 = 252 birds

So, there are more birds in Africa than in Asia. Therefore, the number of families of birds that flew to Africa is greater than the number of families that flew to Asia."
"Response:  We know that 47 families of birds flew to Africa and 94 families flew to Asia. So, we have:

Number of families that flew to Africa = 47
Number of families that flew to Asia = 94

Now, let's find out how many more families flew to Asia than to Africa:

More families flew to Asia than to Africa = Number of families that flew to Asia - Number of families that flew to Africa
= 94 - 47
= 47

So, there are 47 more families of birds that flew to Asia than to Africa."
"Response:  We know that most animals migrate to warmer countries during winter and that there are 18 families of birds near the mountain. If 38 families of birds went to Africa and 80 families went to Asia, then we can calculate how many families went to Europe or other parts of the world as follows:

Let X be the number of bird families that went to Europe or other parts of the world.
We know that the total number of bird families that left is equal to 38 + 80 = 118.
So, we can set up the equation:
X + 18 = 118
Solving for X, we get:
X = 118 - 18 = 100
Therefore, 100 bird families went to Europe or other parts of the world."
"Response:  If there were already 87 families of birds living near the mountain and then 18 new families arrived, we can calculate how many families of birds live nearby as follows:

Number of original bird families = 87
New bird families arriving = 18
Total number of bird families = Original + New
= 87 + 18
= 105
Therefore, there are 105 families of birds living near the mountain."
"Response:  We know that:

* 49 families of birds live near the mountain.
* 59 families of birds have left for warmer climates.
* 24 new families of birds have arrived from Arctic regions to live near the mountain.

So, we can calculate the total number of bird families living near the mountain as follows:

Total number of bird families = Number of bird families already there + Number of new bird families arriving
= 49 + 24
= 73

Therefore, there are 73 bird families living near the mountain."
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds migrated away from the mountain for winter and only 14 families remained near the mountain. So, initially there were 41 families of birds near the mountain (41 - 27 = 14).
Response:  We know that 86 families of birds migrated to warmer countries for winter and initially there were 45 families living near the mountain. So, the number of families remaining after migration is:  Number of families remaining = Initial number of families - Number of families that migrated = 45 - 86 = 41 families.
Response:  We know that 35 families of birds flew to Asia and 62 families flew to Africa. So, we can write this as an equation: 35 + 62 = x, where x is the number of families of birds that flew to Africa more than those who flew to Asia. Since we are told that almost all animals migrate to warmer countries during winter, it means that the number of families of birds that flew to Africa is greater than the number of families that flew to Asia. Therefore, we can conclude that x > 35. In other words, more than 35 families of birds flew to Africa than to Asia.
"Response:  We know that:
Zima has almost arrived and most animals are migrating to warmer countries.
There are 3 families of birds living near the mountain.
26 new families of birds have come from Arctic regions, while 2 families of birds flew south for winter.
So, we need to find out how many bird families are nearby.
Let X be the number of bird families living near the mountain before the migration started (i.e., when it was still warm).
We know that after the migration, there will be X + 26 new families = 28 families in total living near the mountain.
Now, let Y be the number of bird families that stayed back in the area where they were originally found (i.e., those who did not migrate either because they cannot or because they prefer colder climates).
We know that Y + 2 = 26 new families that came from Arctic regions.
So, Y = 24.
Therefore, the number of bird families living near the mountain before the migration started is X = 24."
Response:  We know that Paul received a box of 253 kernels for his birthday and he lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, the number of kernels he had at the end of the school year is:  Number of kernels = Original amount - Amount lost/given away = 253 - 70 = 183 kernels Therefore, there were 183 kernels left with Paul at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 551 chocolate coins at Christmas and lost or gave away some of them during the school year. At the end of the year, he had only 177 left. So, if we want to find out how many chocolate coins Paul got for his birthday, we can use the following equation: Number of chocolate coins Paul got for his birthday = Total number of chocolate coins Paul received - Number of chocolate coins Paul had at the end of the school year. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of chocolate coins Paul got for his birthday = 551 - 177 = 374 chocolate coins. Therefore, Paul got 374 chocolate coins for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 kredkas for his birthday and gave away 111 of them to his friends during the school year. This means he has 329 kredkas left (440 - 111 = 329). Now, we are told that Paul lost 106 kredkas. So, the final number of kredkas Paul has is 329 - 106 = 223 kredkas. Therefore, the answer is 223.
Response:  We know that Paul received 65 candies in his gift box and gave away 213 candies to his friends throughout the school year. So he has given away more than he got. Now we need to find out how many candies were lost or given away. According to the problem, Paul lost 16 candies, so the total number of candies he gave away is: 213 - 16 = 197. Therefore, the answer is 197.
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 candies in his gift box and gave away 571 of them to his friends during the school year. This means he has 18 candies left (589 - 571 = 18). Now, we are told that Paul lost 161 candies. So, the total number of candies Paul had at the end of the school year is 18 + 161 = 179 candies. Therefore, the answer to the question is 179.
Response:  We know that Paul received 110 kredkos as a gift and gave away 90 of them to his friends during the school year. This means he has 210 kredkos left (110 - 90 = 210). Now we are told that Paul lost 412 kredkos. So, the difference between the number of kredkos he lost and the number he gave away is 412 - 90 = 322 kredkos. Therefore, Paul lost 322 more kredkos than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul gave his friends 563 cookies during the school year and lost 558 of them. So he has 332 cookies left. Now we are asked how many cookies Paul received as a gift on his birthday. Since he had only 332 cookies left after giving some away, it means that he must have received an equal number of cookies (332) as a gift on his birthday. Therefore, the answer is 332.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 kredeki to his friends during the school year and lost 535 kredkis himself. So he had 492 kredkis left initially. If he gave away 52 kredkis, then he has 492 - 52 = 440 remaining kredkis. Now we are told that he lost 535 kredkis, so he has 440 - 535 = -195 kredkis. Since negative numbers can't be counted as an amount of something, we can conclude that Paul lost 195 kredkis.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 521 kredkami and 66 gumkami in total (521 + 66 = 587). Then he received some more gummi bears as a gift, but we don't know how many exactly. At the end of the year, he only had 154 left, which means that he lost or gave away some amount of gummi bears during the year. So, to find out how many gummi bears were lost or given away, we can subtract the number of gummi bears he had at the beginning of the year from the number he had at the end of the year: 587 - 154 = 433. Therefore, 433 gummi bears were lost or given away during the year.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 531 kredkami and 38 gumkami in total (gumkami are not included in the count). Then he received some more kredkami as a gift, but did not receive any new gumkami. At the end of the year, he still had 391 kredkami left, which means he lost 140 kredkami during the year (531 - 391 = 140). So initially, Paul had 531 + 140 = 671 kredków.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 601 kredkami and 406 gumkami for a total of 1007 items (601 + 406 = 1007). Then he received more gumkas as a gift, but lost some due to not having any left at the end of the year. So, let's calculate how many gumkas he had at the end of the year:  At the end of the year, Paul had 336 gumkas remaining, which means he lost 669 gumkas throughout the year (1007 - 336 = 669). Now, we can see how many gumkas he had more than kredkas:  To find out how many gumkas Paul had more than kredkas, we need to subtract the number of kredkas from the number of gumkas:  Gumkas - Kredkas = 669 - 601 = 158 (gumkas > kredkas by 158) Therefore, Paul had 158 more gumkas than kredkas at the end of the year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 400 pens at Christmas and he lost or gave away 315 of them. So, the number of pens he had left is: 400 - 315 = 185. Therefore, Paul got 185 pens for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 cookies for his birthday and lost 231 of them throughout the school year. This means he has 34 remaining (267 - 231 = 34). Now, we are asked how many more cookies Paul gave away to his friends than he lost. To find this difference, we subtract the number of cookies he lost from the total number of cookies he gave away: 308 - 231 = 77. So, Paul gave away 77 more cookies to his friends than he lost.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 457 gumballs and 320 candy canes. If he didn't lose any, then he must have ended with 457 + 320 = 777 candies in total. So, he still has 777 - 523 = 254 candies left at the end of the school year. Therefore, Paul had 254 krystals (candies) left at the end of the school year.
Response:  At first, Kelner had 11 clients. Then, some of them left, and he still had 3 clients. So, the number of clients that remained is equal to the original number minus the number that left. In this case, it means that 11 - 4 = 7 clients remained with Kelner after some of them left. Therefore, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  At first, Kelner had 3 clients. Then some of them left, so he had fewer clients. But he still had 4 clients after they left. So, the number of new clients that joined him is equal to the number of clients who left minus the number of clients he already had. In this case, 2 - 4 = -2 new clients joined him. Therefore, there were -2 more clients than the ones who left.
"Response:  At first, Kelner had x clients. After 9 clients left, he still had 12 clients. So, we can write an equation:
x - 9 = 12
Now solve for x:
x = 12 + 9
x = 21
Therefore, at the beginning, Kelner had 21 clients."
Response:  We know that Kelner had 14 clients initially and then 5 of them left. So, we need to find out how many clients are left now. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of clients remaining = Initial number of clients - Number of clients who left. In this case, the initial number of clients was 14, and 5 clients left, so we can plug these values into the formula as follows: Number of clients remaining = 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, Kelner has 9 clients left.
Response:  At first, Kelner had 13 clients. Then, some of them left, so he had fewer clients. We don't know how many exactly, but let's assume it was 5. So, after that, he had 8 clients (13 - 5 = 8). Later, 4 new clients arrived, so now he has 12 clients (8 + 4 = 12). Therefore, the number of clients Kelner had afterward is 12.
Response:  At first, Kelner had 12 clients. Then, 15 of them left, so he lost 15 - 12 = 3 clients. Now, he gained 14 new clients, so his final number of clients is 3 + 14 = 17 clients. Therefore, Kelner has 17 clients in total.
Response:  At first, Kelner had 3 clients (C1). Then more people arrived and he already had 8 clients in total (C2). So, the number of new clients that came is C2 - C1 = 5.
Response:  At first, Kelner had 8 clients and then some left, so he had 5 remaining clients. Then, he got 99 new clients, so in total he has 104 clients (99 + 5).
Response:  At first, Kelner had 12 clients and then some left, so he had 14 clients. Then, he gained 10 new clients, so he has 24 clients in total (14 + 10).
Response:  At first, Dan had $2 dollars. Then he bought a bat...
Response:  We know that Dan received $4 dollars after buying a battonic and he had $3 before buying it. So, the cost of the battonic is $4 - $3 = $1.
Response:  We know that Dan bought 99 baton for $3 dollars and each baton cost him $0.03. So, he spent in total $0.03 x 99 = $3.07. Therefore, there is $3 - $3.07 = $0.93 left over after buying all those batons.
"Response:  We know that Dan paid $3 for 2 batons and each baton cost him $4. So, we can write an equation as follows:

$3 = 2 \times $4

Now, let's solve for the cost of one chocolate:

$4 = $3 / 2

Therefore, each chocolate costs $2."
Response:  We know that Dan paid $2 for the batonics and he bought several of them. So, let's assume he bought x batonics. Since each baton costs $3, we can write an equation as follows:  $2 = 3x +? (where? represents the cost of each additional baton) Now, we are told that Dan spent a total of $6 on all the batonics he bought. Therefore, we can add up the cost of all the batonics he bought to find out how many he actually bought: $6 = 3x + 3(x) (where x is the number of batonics Dan bought) Simplifying this equation, we get: $6 = 3x + 9x Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us: $3 = 9x Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 3 So, Dan bought 3 batonics in total.
Response:  Firstly, he spent $2 for the batnik and $3 for the chocolate. So, he spent in total $5. Now, we know that he had $7 initially, so after buying these items, he has $7 - $5 = $2 left. Therefore, there are $2 remaining dollars.
Response:  Batonik cost $7, so he spent $7 on that. Czekolada cost $6, so he spent $6 on that. Total amount spent = $7 + $6 = $13. So, he spent $13 on both batons and chocolates.
Response:  Batonik cost $6, so he paid $6 for that. Czekolada costs $3, so he paid $3 for that too. So in total, he spent $6 + $3 = $9. Therefore, he spent $9 on both batons and chocolates combined.
Response:  We know that Dan spent $5 dollars in total. He bought a bat...
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for the batonnic and then his friend gave him $5. So, in total, he received $9 ( $4 + $5).
"Response:  If he had $4 at the beginning and spent $3 on the bat... (read more)
Dan had $4 to start with and spent $3 on the bat. So now he has $1 left. Therefore, the cost of the bat was $3."
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for 10 batons, so each baton cost $0.40. Now we need to find out how much money Dan had before buying the batons and after buying them. Before buying the batons, Dan had $3 - $0.40 = $2.60. After buying the batons, he had $4 - $0.40 = $3.60. So, the amount of money Dan had is $3.60.
Response:  We know that Dan bought 3 dollars worth of batons for $4. So, each baton cost half as much as the total amount he spent: $\frac{1}{2}$ \times $4 = 2$. Now we need to find out how many candies Dan bought with his remaining money. Since each baton costs $2$, and he has $2 - 2 = 0$ left over after buying the batons, he can buy $0 \div 2 = 0$ candies. Therefore, each candy cost $2$.
"Response:  We know that Dan paid $3 for the chocolate bar and $7 for the bat...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that Dan paid $3 for the chocolate bar and $7 for the bat. So, he spent a total of $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent $10 on both the chocolate bar and the bat."
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for the chocolate and $7 for the batniki. So in total he spent $4 + $7 = $11. Therefore, he spent $11 on chocolate and $11 on batniki.
Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them at a garage sale. So, the number of books left with him is: 115 - 78 = 37 books. Therefore, Paul has 37 books left after selling 78 books at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, Paul had x books. After selling 137 of them in an auction, he had x - 137 books left. Now we know that he has 105 books left. So, we can write an equation: x - 137 = 105. Solving for x, we get: x = 220. Therefore, Paul had 220 books at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after selling some of them in an garage sale he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Books initial = 108  Books sold at garage sale = x  Total books left with Paul = 62 Now, we need to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that Paul gave 35 books to his friend. Therefore, the number of books sold at the garage sale is equal to the total number of books minus the number of books given away to the friend. So, we can rewrite the above equation as:  Books sold at garage sale = 108 - 35 = 73 Now, we have found out that Paul sold 73 books at the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and after buying some in a discount sale, he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of books Paul had = 50
Number of books bought in discount sale = x
Total number of books = Number of books Paul had + Number of books bought in discount sale
= 50 + x

Now, we are given that the total number of books is 151. So, we can solve for 'x' using substitution method:

151 = 50 + x
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives us:

x = 101

Therefore, Paul bought 101 books in the discount sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially two books (he said he had ""dwie""). Then, after selling some of them in a garage sale, he bought 150 new ones. So, his total number of books is equal to the initial number plus the number he bought. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books = Initial number + Number bought  In this case, the initial number was 2, and the number bought was 150. So, we can plug these values into the equation:  Number of books = 2 + 150  Number of books = 152  Therefore, Paul sold 148 books (58 - 148 = 0)."
Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. Then he bought 42 new books, so he has 42 + 21 = 63 books now. Finally, he has 15 books left, which means he sold 63 - 15 = 48 more books than he bought.
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Then, after the garage sale, he bought 38 new books, so his total number of books is: 71 + x - 38 = 116 Now we want to find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold. To do this, we can subtract the number of books he sold (x) from the number of books he bought (38): x - 38 = 116 - 71 = 45 So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 108 books and 55 dungarees. After selling some of these items in an auction, he got $23 for each book and $45 for each dungaree. So, he sold a total of $23 x 108 = $2460 from his books and $45 x 55 = $2475 from his dungarees. Now we are told that after selling these items at the garage sale, he has 66 books and 59 dungarees left. Therefore, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is 66 - 108 = -$42 books. Similarly, the number of dungarees he sold is 59 - 55 = +$4 dungarees.
Response:  We know that initially Paweł had 106 długopisów and after selling some of them in an auction, he had 82 długopisów left. So, we can calculate how many długopisy were sold in the auction as follows: Number of długopisy sold = Initial number of długopisy - Final number of długopisy = 106 - 82 = 24 Therefore, Paweł sold 24 długopisy in the auction.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 136 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. The number of books he sold can be found by subtracting the number of books he has left (27) from the initial number of books he had (136):

136 - 27 = 109

So, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 134 books and gave away 39 to his friend. So he had 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then he sold some of them in a garage sale, but we don't know how many exactly. Therefore, we can assume that he sold x books at the garage sale. Now let's calculate the number of books Paul has left: 95 - x = 68 (since there are 68 books left). To find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale, we need to divide the number of books he has left by the number of books he originally had: x / 134 =... (we don't have enough information to finish this calculation).
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 letters and 153 books. If he sold some of them at an auction, then he has fewer items now. Specifically, we are told that after selling some of his belongings in an attic, he was left with 13 books and 23 long letters. So, to find out how many books he sold at the auction, we can subtract the number of books he has left from the initial total number of books he owned:  95 - 13 = 82 books were sold at the auction.
Response:  We know that initially Paweł had 143 books and 42 pens. After selling some of his books in a garage sale, he got 113 books back. Now we need to find out how many pens he sold at the garage sale. Since he had 42 pens initially, and after the sale, he has 113 books, it means that he must have sold all his 42 pens at the garage sale. So, the answer is 42.
Response:  At first, there were 10 roses in the garden. Then, Jessica picked 8 more roses from the garden and placed them in the vase. So, now there are 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the garden that Jessica picked and placed in the vase. Then, she added another 7 roses to the vase, making the total number of roses 23. So, the answer is 16 + 7 = 23.
Response:  We know that Jessica threw away four roses and put new ones in the vase. So, initially there were 4 + 4 = 8 roses in the vase. Then she added 23 more roses, so the total number of roses is 8 + 23 = 31 roses. Therefore, the answer to the question is 31.
Response:  Jessica wyrzuciła 33 roses from the vase and cut several new roses from her garden to put in the vase. Now there are 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she cut than threw away, we can subtract the number of roses thrown away (33) from the total number of roses in the vase (17): 17 - 33 = -16 Therefore, Jessica cut 16 more roses than she threw away.
Response:  We know that Jessica threw away 34 roses and put new ones in the vase. So, there are 15 roses left in the vase after she did this. Now, let's count how many roses Jessica threw away more than she picked from the garden:  Jessica threw away 34 roses - 34 = 6 roses fewer than she picked from the garden. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that in total, Jessica had 59 roses and she picked up some more from her garden. So, let's assume that she picked up x more roses. Since there are 20 roses left in the vase, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of roses = Total number of roses - Number of roses in the vase 59 = x + 20  Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: 59 = x  Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us: 39 = x  Therefore, Jessica picked up 39 additional roses beyond what was already in the vase.
Response:  We know that Jessica picked up 13 roses from the garden and then she added some more roses to the vase, which had in total 12 roses already. So, if we add 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Therefore, there are 25 roses in the vase now.  Now, let's find out how many roses were left in the garden after Jessica took some away. To do this, we need to subtract the number of roses Jessica took (13) from the initial number of roses in the garden (12). So, the number of roses left in the garden is 12 - 13 = -1 rose.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica took some more roses and orchids from her garden and put them into the vase. So, now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica took away, we can subtract the number of roses she had at first (15) from the new total number of roses (17): 17 - 15 = 2. Therefore, Jessica took away 2 roses from the vase. Now, let's calculate the number of orchids:  Initially, there were 62 orchids in the vase, and then Jessica added more orchids from her garden, making the total number of orchids 96. So, the difference between the initial number of orchids and the final number of orchids is also equal to 2: 96 - 62 = 34. Therefore, Jessica took away 34 orchids from the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked some more roses from her garden and put them into the vase. So now there are 10 roses left in the vase. But we also know that Jessica picked some orchids from her garden too! So now there are 21 orchids in the vase. Therefore, the number of orchids that Jessica picked is 21 - 2 = 19.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the garden. Then Jessica picked some more roses from the garden. So, after this operation, there are still 5 roses left in the garden (since she only took some of them). Now, let's consider what happened to the orchids. Since we know that Jessica picked ""kilka"" (a few) orchids from the garden as well, it means that before taking any orchids away, there were already 3 orchids in the garden. Therefore, after Jessica took some orchids away, there are now 3 orchids less than originally. Thus, the final number of orchids in the garden is 2. Finally, since there are 12 roses remaining in the garden after Jessica took some away, there must be 9 more roses than orchids in the garden (12 - 2 = 9). So, the answer is: Roses - 9 Orchids."
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the garden. Then Jessica picked some more roses and orchids from the garden. Now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the garden. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the garden, we can use the following equation: Number of orchids = Original number of orchids + Number of orchids picked - Number of roses picked Number of orchids = 12 + (12 - 7) = 19 Therefore, there are 19 more orchids than roses in the garden.
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses in the vase and Jessica cut out 7 more from the garden, then the total number of roses in the vase now is:  Initially, there were 3 roses + 7 new roses = 10 roses in the vase. Therefore, Jessica cut out 7 additional roses from the garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica took some more roses and orchids from her garden and put them into the vase. Now there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica took from her garden, we can subtract the number of roses left after she added new ones (14) from the initial number of roses (13):  So, Jessica took 13 - 14 = -1 rose(s) from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica took some more roses from her garden and put them into the vase. So now we have 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. To find out how many orchids Jessica took from the original bouquet, we can subtract the number of orchids left in the vase after she added new ones from her garden. Therefore, the answer is 13 - 3 = 10 orchids that Jessica took from the original bouquet.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. So now there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase, we can subtract the number of orchids from the total number of flowers:  Number of roses = Total number of flowers - Number of orchids  In this case, the total number of flowers is 21 + 22 = 43. Therefore, the number of roses in the vase is:  Number of roses = 43 - 20 = 23  So, there are 23 more roses than orchids in the vase.
Response:  We know that in Jessica's garden there were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden. So, after this operation, there are still 9 roses in the garden. Now let's count how many orchids are left in the garden after Jessica took some of them. There were originally 6 orchids in the garden, but then Jessica took 2 more orchids from the garden. Therefore, after taking these orchids away, there are now 4 orchids remaining in the garden. Finally, we add up all the orchids and roses in the garden to find out how many orchids there are compared to roses. In total, there are 13 orchids (including those taken from Jessica's garden) plus 9 roses = 22 flowers in total. Since there are more orchids than roses, there are 13 orchids for every 9 roses.
"Response:  We know that Robin's hair was originally 17 cm long and she cut off several centimeters of it. If her hair is now 13 cm long, then we can calculate how many centimeters she cut off using the following formula:

Centimeters cut off = New length - Original length
= 13 cm - 17 cm
= -4 cm

So, Robin cut off 4 cm of her hair."
Response:  Before cutting her hair, Robin had 20 cm (or 8 inches) long hair. Now she has 10 cm (or 4 inches) long hair. So, we can calculate the original length of her hair as follows:   Original length = New length / (1 - Decrease percentage) = 10 cm / (1 - 0.5) = 16 cm
"Response:  We know that Robin had 16 long hair before cutting it off. After cutting off 15 centimeters (or 6 inches), she had less hair than before. So let's call the new length of her hair x centimeters. Since she gained 12 centimeters after cutting her hair, we can write an equation:
x + 15 = 16
Now solve for x:
x = 16 - 15
x = 1
So Robin has 100 hair now."
Response:  We know that Robin's hair was initially 19 inches long. If she grew an additional 18 inches, then her new length would be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, currently, Robin has 37 inches of hair.
Response:  If Robin had 14 cm of hair initially and cut off 13 cm, then she has 14 - 13 = 1 cm left now.
Response:  At first, Robin had 14 long hair. Then she cut off 8 inches of her hair, so now she has 6 inches (or 15 cm) less than before. Finally, she cut another 20 inches off, which means she is left with 4 inches (or 10 cm) of hair. Therefore, Robin currently has 4 inches (or 10 cm) of hair.
"Response:  We know that Danny has 12 buttons in his collection and he found 53 bottle caps in the park. So, if each button represents one cape, then we have:

12 (buttons) x 1 (cape per button) = 12 capes

Therefore, Danny has 12 capes in total."
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 caps in his collection and he found more than 50 bottles in the park. So, if he found 53 bottles in total, then he must have had at least 21 + 53 = 74 bottles in the park. Therefore, the correct answer is 74.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 63 caps in the park and threw away 51 old ones. So he has 12 (63 - 51) new caps now. If he had x caps at the beginning, then after throwing away y old caps, he will have x - y new caps. Since he has 33 new caps now, we can set up the equation:  x - y = 33...(1) Now we are given that y = 51. Substituting this value into equation (1), we get:  x - 51 = 33...(2) Solving for x, we get:  x = 84...(3) Therefore, Danny had 84 caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 caps in the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 1 more cap than he threw away. Therefore, the number of caps Danny found in the park is equal to the number of caps he threw away plus 1, which is 35 + 1 = 36.  So, Danny found 36 caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 caps in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he gained 30 - 63 = -33 caps. Since he now has 42 caps in his collection, we can see that he must have thrown away more than he found. Therefore, the number of caps Danny threw away is greater than the number he found in the park, which is -33.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 22 caps and packaging in the park. Then he found 8 more packages and caps at home, so he now has 28 caps and 63 packages in his collection. To find out how many hats Danny had at the beginning, we can subtract the number of caps he already had from the total number of caps he collected: 28 - 22 = 6. So, Danny had 6 hats at the beginning.
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 Nakraweteks and 30 Opakowanz in the park. He collected 17 Nakraweteks and 57 Opakowanz from the park, so he has 17 + 57 = 74 Opakowanz now. Since he also collected 22 Nakraweteks, he has 22 + 74 = 96 Nakraweteks in his collection now. Therefore, Danny had 57 Opakowanz at the beginning.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 30 caps and 14 packages in the park. He now has 7 caps and 86 packaging in his collection. To find out how many more bags he collected than bottles, we need to subtract the number of bags he already had from the total number of bags he found:  
$$ \text {Number of more bags = Total number of bags found - Number of bags already had} $$  In this case, the total number of bags found is 30 + 14 = 44. And the number of bags he already had is 7. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  
$$ \text {Number of more bags = 44 - 7 = 37 } $$  Therefore, Danny collected 37 more bags than bottles in the park."
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 Nakrawieks and 28 Opakowanz in the park.  He now has 68 Nakrawieks and 51 Opakowanz in his collection. So he gained 39 more Opakowanz than Nakrawieks (68 - 11 = 57). Therefore, Danny found 57 more Opakowanz than Nakrawieks in the park.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 71 caps and 24 packages in the park. He now has 28 caps and 16 packaging in his collection. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

Caps found = 71
Caps collected = 28
Packages found = 24
Packages collected = 16

Now, let's solve for the number of more caps than packages:

More caps = 28 - 16 = 12

So, Danny has 12 more caps than packages. Therefore, he has 12 + 24 = 36 more packages than caps."
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 Nakraweteks and 62 Opakowanz in the park. Then he collected 27 Nakraweteks and 43 Opakowanz to his collection. So, the total number of Opakowanz Danny has now is:  62 + 43 = 105 Opakowanz. Therefore, Danny has more Opakowanz than Nakraweteks.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 66 Nakrawki in the park and lost 66 of them. So he has 0 Nakrawki left. Now, we are told that he has 25 Nakrawki in his collection. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 25 - 66 = -41 Nakrawki.
Response:  If Danny had 25 Nakrątki in his collection before he found some more in the park, then he must have found x Nakrątki in the park. Since he now has 32 Nakrątki in total, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of Nakrątki = 25 + x  So, if we substitute x = number of Nakrątki found in the park, we get:  Number of Nakrątki = 25 + x  Now, we are given that Danny has 32 Nakrątki in total, so we can set up another equation:  Total number of Nakrątki = Number of Nakrątki in Danny's collection + Number of Nakrątki found in the park  Substituting the values from the first equation into this second equation gives us:  Total number of Nakrątki = 25 + x + 32  Simplifying and solving for x (the number of Nakrątki found in the park), we get:  x = 7  Therefore, Danny found 7 Nakrątki in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 old caps in the park and found 58 new ones, so he has a total of 67 caps now. To find out how many caps Danny had at the beginning, we can use the information given in the problem that he started with 60 caps. Therefore, Danny had 60 - 60 = 0 caps at the beginning. So, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 Nakrewtks in total and he threw away 6 old ones. So, the number of new Nakrewtks he found is 60 - 6 = 54. Therefore, Danny found more than three times as many new Nakrewtks as he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 54 old caps in the park and found 48 new ones. So he has 52 caps left after throwing away 6 (54 - 6 = 52). Therefore, Danny wyrzucił więcej czapek niż te, które znalazł w parku.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 82 packaging and caps in the park. He already had 42 caps in his collection before going to the park. So, he gained 82 - 42 = 40 more caps in the park. Similarly, we know that he found 29 caps and 39 packages in the park. Therefore, he gained 29 + 39 = 68 additional items for his collection. Thus, Danny now has 40 + 68 = 108 caps and packages in his collection.
Response:  At first, Danny had 39 empty bottles and caps in the park. Then he found 66 packaging materials and added them to his collection. So, initially, Danny had 39 + 66 = 105 packaging materials. Therefore, he had 68 opaksnings (since each cap can be used multiple times).
Response:  We know that Danny found 50 Nakresek and 46 Opakowations in the park. He now has 21 Nakreseks and 52 Opakowations in his collection. So he gained 39 more Opakowations than Nakreseks (52 - 21 = 39). Therefore, there are 39 more opakowations than capeks in Danny's collection.
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 packages and caps in the park. He collected 31 caps and 9 packages. So he must have had 34 packages left over (65 - 31 = 34). Therefore, Danny found more packages than caps in the park.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 58 caps and 25 wrappers in the park. He now has 11 wrappers and 12 cap

Answer: 12 - 11 = 1 more cap than wrapper"
Response:  We know that Danny found 15 caps and 18 wrappers in the park. So he had 15 + 18 = 33 items initially. Now, he has 67 opacements and 35 caps, so he gained 67 - 35 = 32 more opacements than caps. Therefore, Danny has 32 more opacements than caps now.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 broccolis less than Steven. So if Jake has 17 broccolis, then Steven must have 28 broccolis (17 - 11 = 6).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccoli than Steven. So, if Jake has x broccoli, then Steven has x + 14 broccoli. Since Steven has more broccoli than Jake, we can say that Jake has less than or equal to x broccoli. Therefore, Jake has at most 7 broccoli (since he cannot have more than 7 broccoli). So, the correct answer is 7.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccoli than Steven. So, if Jake has x broccoli, then Steven has x + 13 broccoli. Since Steven has 19 broccoli in total, we can set up the equation:
x + (13) = 19
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So, Jake has 6 broccoli and Jill has 12 - 6 = 6 broccoli."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than three broccolis less than Steven. So if Steven has x broccolis, then Jake has x - 3 broccolis.  Since Steven has 8 more broccolis than Jill, we can say that Jill has x - 8 broccolis. Now, we are given that Steven has 5 broccolis. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 3 = (Jake)
x - 8 = (Jill)
Solving for Jake and Jill, we get:
Jake has 2 broccolis.
Jill has 7 broccolis."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 12 broccolis and Steven has more than 11 broccolis. So, if we subtract the number of broccolis that Jake has from the number that Steven has, we will get the difference between their numbers of broccolis. Therefore, the answer is:  Jill has 7 more broccoli than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 broccolis than Steven and more than 9 than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x broccolis, then we can write an inequality based on the information given in the problem:
x < 7 (since Jake has fewer than 7 broccolis than Steven)
x > 9 (since Jake has more than 9 broccolis than Jill)
Now, let's solve for x using substitution or elimination method. Since there are no negative values of x mentioned in the problem, we will use the substitution method to find the value of x. Substituting the first inequality into the second one gives us:
x - 7 > 9
Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:
x > 2
So, Jake has at least 2 broccolis. Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 broccolis than Steven and more than 8 than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x broccolis, then Steven has 7 - x broccoli and Jill has 8 + x broccoli. Now, we are told that Steven has 17 broccolis, so we can set up the equation: 7 - x = 17. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. Therefore, Jill has 8 + 10 = 18 broccolis.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 9 broccolis less than Steven and more than 18 than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x broccolis, then Steven has x + 9 broccolis and Jill has x - 18 broccolis. Since Steven has 16 broccolis in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 9) = 16. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 9 = 16. Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = 7. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 3.5. Therefore, Steven has 3.5 more broccolis than Jake.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 18 broccolis than Jill. So if Jill has x broccolis, then Steven has x + 18 broccolis. Now we are told that Jake has fewer than 6 broccolis than Steven. So if Steven has x broccolis, then Jake has x - 6 broccolis. Therefore, Jake has 5 broccolis.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccolis than Steven. So if Jake has x broccolis, then Steven has x + 18 broccolis. Since Jill has 87 broccolis more than Steven, we can say that Jill has (x + 18) + 87 = 95 broccolis. Therefore, Jake has 95 - x broccolis less than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 15 brzoskwini than Jake. So if Jake has x brzoskwini, then Steven has x + 15 = 31 brzoskwini. Now we know that Jill has fewer brzoskwini than both Jake and Steven. Therefore, Jill has x - (x + 15) = -4 brzoskwini less than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccoli than Steven. So, if Jake has x broccoli, then Steven has x + 19 broccoli. Also, we know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has y apples, then Steven has y - 14 apples. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 19) = 79... (1)
y - 14 = 12... (2)
Now, let's solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Solving equation (1), we get:

3x = 60
x = 20
Substituting this value of x into equation (2), we get:

y - 14 = 12
y = 36
Therefore, Jake has 20 broccoli and Steven has 36 broccoli."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer brzoskwini than Steven (Jake has 13 less). So, if Steven has 9 brzoskwini and 8 jabłek, then Jake must have 9 + 8 = 17 jabłek. Therefore, Jake has 17 jabłek more than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 8 apples. Since Jake has more pears than Steven, we can say that Jake has x - 6 pears. Therefore, the difference between the number of pears Steven has and the number of pears Jake has is 8 (since Jake has 6 fewer pears). Thus, Steven has 8 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer brzoskwini than Steven and more apples than Steven. So, we can start with Jake's information to find out how many apples he has. According to the question, Jake has 3 brzoskwini less than Steven, which means he has 3 - x brzoskwini where x is the number of brzoskwini Steven has. Similarly, Jake has 10 apples more than Steven, which means he has y apples where y is the number of apples Steven has. Now, let's substitute these values in the equation: 3 - x = y + 10  Solving for x, we get:  x = 9  Therefore, Steven has 9 brzoskwini more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 broccolis and Jill has fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of broccolis Jill has from the number of broccolis Steven has, we will get the number of broccolis Jake has. Therefore, Jake has 12 - (67 - x) = 12 - 60 = 6 broccolis.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 broccolis and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of broccolis that Jake has from the number of broccolis that Steven has, we will get the number of broccolis that Jill has. Therefore, the answer is 18 - (12 =) 6, which means that Jill has 6 broccolis.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 broccolis and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, Jake must have at least 19 - 7 = 12 broccolis. Therefore, Jake has 12 broccolis.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 14 brzoskwi...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that Steven has 14 brzoskwi..."
"Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has y brzoskwini, then we can write an equation as follows:
Jake = x + 84 (since Jake has 84 more apples than Steven)
Steven = y - 10 (since Steven has 10 fewer brzoskwini than Jake)
Now, let's solve for x (the number of apples Jake has):
x = Jake - (y - 10)
Substituting the values given in the question:
x = 84 - (13 - 10)
x = 71
So, Jake has 71 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has y apples, then we can write an equation as follows:
Jake = x + 13 (since Jake has 13 more apples than Steven)
Steven = y - 17 (since Steven has 17 fewer apples than Jake)
Now, let's solve for x (the number of apples Jake has):
x = 8 (since Steven has 8 apples)
Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
Jake = x + 13 = 8 + 13 = 21
So, Jake has 21 apples in total."
Response:  We know that Steven has 11 jabłek and 18 brzoskwini. If he had fewer than 8 brzoskwini, he would have more jabłek than he currently does. Therefore, the number of brzoskwini Steven has is greater than or equal to 8. Since we also know that Jake has 8 brzoskwini less than Steven, this means that Jake has 8 - 8 = 0 brzoskwini. So, Jake has no brzoskwini. Now let's compare the number of jabłek between them. We know that Steven has 11 jabłek and Jake has 10 jabłek more than Steven. This can be expressed mathematically as: Jake has 11 + 10 = 21 jabłek. Finally, we want to find out how many perszeks Steven has more than jabłek. To do this, we subtract the number of jabłek Jake has from the number of jabłek Steven has: 21 (jabłek Jake) - 11 (jabłek Steven) = 10. So, Steven has 10 perszeks more jabłek than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer brzoskwini than Steven. So, if Jake has x brzoskwini, then Steven has x + 15 brzoskwini. Now we want to find out how many more jabłki Steven has than brzoskwini. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 15 = (x + 15) - x
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
25 = 15
Therefore, Steven has 10 more jabłki than brzoskwini."
Response:  We know that in Olive's purse there was $78 initially. Then she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, we need to find out how much money is left after this transaction. To do this, we can subtract the amount spent ($15) from the initial balance ($78): $$ \therefore 78 - 15 = 63 $$ Therefore, Olive has $63 left in her purse.
Response:  If she spent $78 and has $33 left, then she must have had $45 at first ($78 - $33 = $45).
Response:  We know that in her purse, Olivia had $100 initially. Then she withdrew $148 from an ATM. After visiting the supermarket, she spent $159. So, we can calculate how much money Olivia actually spent as follows:  $100 + ($148 - $100) = $248  Therefore, Olivia spent $248.
Response:  We know that in her purse, Olivia had $3 initially. Then she collected $49 from ATMs. After visiting the supermarket, there were still $49 left. So, we can write an equation:  $3 + $49 = $192 Now, let's solve for the difference between what Olivia spent at the supermarket and how much she collected from ATMs: $192 - $49 = $143 Therefore, Olivia spent $143 more than she collected from ATMs.
Response:  We know that in her purse, Olivia had $53. She also collected $91 from ATMs. After visiting the supermarket, she was left with $14. So, we can write an equation:  $53 + $91 = $14. Simplifying this equation, we get:  $141 = $14. Therefore, Olivia spent $127 more than what she collected ($141 - $14).
Response:  We know that in her purse, Olivia had $106 initially. After visiting the art gallery and spending $49 there, she now has $57 left ($106 - $49 = $57). Then, after visiting the supermarket and spending $26 there, she now has $31 left ($57 - $26 = $31). So, Olivia spent $49 at the art gallery and $26 at the supermarket, for a total of $75 ($49 + $26 = $75). Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is $26.
Response:  After Olivia visited the supermarket and spent $29, she had $54 in her wallet initially. So, she spent $29 / $54 = $\frac{29}{54}$ of her money at the supermarket.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet before that, then after spending money at the supermarket, she would have $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he removed 5 of them, then he has 14 applications left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  At first, Dave had x applications on his phone. After removing 18 of them, he was left with y applications. So, we can write an equation: x - 18 = y. Now, we are told that after removing 18 applications, Dave was left with 5 applications. Therefore, we can substitute y = 5 in the above equation to get: x - 18 = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 23. So, Dave had 23 applications on his phone at the beginning.
"Response:  We know that Dave had initially 10 applications on his phone and then added 11 new ones. So, the total number of applications he had was:

10 + 11 = 21

Now, we are asked how many applications Dave removed. The answer is given as 4. Therefore, the number of applications Dave removed is:

21 - 4 = 17

So, Dave removed 17 applications from his phone."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and added 89 new ones. So, his total number of applications is: $21 + 89 = 106$. Now, we are asked how many he has after removing some apps. The statement says ""Po usunięciu niektórych pozostało mu 24"". This means that Dave removed some apps from his phone, leaving him with 24 applications. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of apps (21) and the final number of apps (24) is: $21 - 24 = -3$. So, Dave added 89 new apps and removed 3 old apps."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially and then he added 71 new ones. So, the total number of applications on his phone after adding the new ones is:

15 + 71 = 86

Now, we are asked to find out how many more applications Dave removed than he added. To do this, we need to subtract the number of applications he removed from the total number of applications he added:

86 - 71 = 15

So, Dave removed 15 more applications than he added."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. Then he removed some of them, leaving him with 5 applications and 23 files. So, to find out how many applications Dave removed, we can divide the number of remaining applications (5) by the initial number of applications (16):

5 / 16 = 0.3125

So, Dave removed 3 applications."
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 files and 17 applications initially. If he removed some apps and files, then he has fewer of them now. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of files = Initial number of files - Number of files removed. Similarly, for applications, we have: Number of applications = Initial number of applications - Number of applications removed. Now let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of files = 21 - x (where x is the number of files removed) Number of applications = 17 - y (where y is the number of applications removed) From the information provided, we know that Dave removed 5 files and 4 applications. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equations above: Number of files = 21 - 5 = 16 Number of applications = 17 - 4 = 13 Substituting these values back into the original equations, we get: Number of files = 16 Number of applications = 13 So, Dave removed 5 files and 4 applications from his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially. Then he removed some of them, leaving him with 21 applications and 4 files. So, in total, Dave has 21 applications on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially.  When he removed some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. So, to find out how many files (excluding applications) Dave has left, we can subtract the number of applications from the total number of files:  Number of files = Total number of files - Number of applications = 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, besides applications, Dave has 9 files left on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications on his phone initially and after adding some more he had 18 remaining apps. So, we can say that Dave added x number of applications where x = 18 - 17 = 1. Therefore, Dave added one application to his phone.
Response:  We know that initially Dave had 59 files and applications on his phone. Then he removed some of them, leaving him with 12 applications and 30 files. So, to find out how many applications Dave removed, we can subtract the number of applications he had after removing them from the initial number: $12 - 59 = -47$. Therefore, Dave removed 47 applications.
Response:  We know that initially there were 24 files and 13 applications on Dave's phone. After removing some apps and files, there were 17 apps and 21 files left. So, we can say that Dave removed 7 files (24 - 21 = 7) and 6 apps (13 - 17 = -6). Therefore, Dave removed 7 + (-6) = 1 file and 6 + (-6) = -6 apps.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone initially. Then he removed some of them, leaving him with 5 files and 12 applications. So, in total, Dave has 12 applications on his phone.
Response:  We know that initially Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. Then he removed some of them, leaving him with 24 files and 2 applications. So, in total, Dave has 24 files (not including applications) left on his phone.
"Response:  We know that Nell has 242 cards in total and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate the number of cards Nell has left as follows:

Nell's remaining cards = Total cards - Cards given to Jeff
= 242 - 136
= 106

Therefore, Nell has 106 cards left after giving 136 cards to Jeff."
Response:  At first, Nell had 301 cards. She gave 301 of her cards to Jeff and now she has 154 cards left. So, initially, Nell had 301 cards.
Response:  Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of cards (528) and her current number of cards (252). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 528 - 252 = 276 cards.
Response:  If Nell gave Jeff some cards and now has 535 cards left, then she had 535 - 234 = 301 more cards than Jeff initially. So, Jeff had 234 cards at first. Therefore, Jeff has 234 + 301 = 535 cards now.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she now has 415 - 309 = 116 baseball cards left. Since she also gave away 356 10-card sets, she now has 116 + 356 = 472 cards in total. Therefore, Nell has more than 10 baseball cards because she has 472 - 10 = 462 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she has fewer than 246 - x baseball cards left. Then we are told that she has 404 + 495 = 899 total cards. Since she gave some to Jeff, she must have more cards in her collection now than she did before. Therefore, the number of cards she has is greater than or equal to 899. But since she only gave some to Jeff, not all of them, so the difference between the number of cards she has now and the original number is less than or equal to 899 - 246 = 653. So Nell has at least 653 baseball cards left after giving some to Jeff. Now let's find out how many cards from category 10 she has. We know that she gave some to Jeff, but we don't know exactly how many. So let's assume that she gave him x cards from category 10 as well. Then the total number of cards she has is 404 + 495 = 899, and the number of cards she has from category 10 is 214 + x = 899. Solving for x, we get x = 685. So Nell has 685 cards from category 10 after giving some to Jeff. Finally, we can calculate the number of cards she has from each category separately: Baseball cards: 246 - x = 653 Category 10: 214 + 685 = 899 Total cards: 246 + 214 + 685 = 1145
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving some to them, she now has 210 cards left. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = Total number of cards Nell had - Number of cards she has left Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 573 - 210 = 363 cards Therefore, Nell gave 363 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer than 438 - (number of cards given to Jeff) = 438 - x cards left with her. Since she also has 18 ten-dollar bills, we can conclude that she has x + 18 cards remaining. Now, since she gave Jeff some cards, he must have received x/2 cards from her. Therefore, the number of baseball cards Nell has more than 10 is (x + 18) / 2 = (55 + 178) / 2 = 123 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she now has fewer than 239 - x baseball cards where x is the number of cards she gave to Jeff. Also, we know that she received 38 ten-dollar bills from Jeff, so she now has $38 + x dollars where x is the number of ten-dollar bills she received. Since each ten-dollar bill is worth $10, we can write this as x = 38 / 10 = 38/10 = 3.8. Therefore, Nell has $38 + 3.8 = 41.8 dollars more than she had before giving the baseball cards to Jeff. Now let's turn to the ten-card packs. We know that Nell had 376 ten-card packs and gave some to Jeff. So she now has fewer than 376 - x ten-card packs where x is the number of ten-card packs she gave to Jeff. Since each ten-card pack contains 10 cards, we can write this as x = 376 / 10 = 37.6 ten-card packs. Therefore, Nell has 37.6 - x ten-card packs left after giving them to Jeff. Since we already determined that x = 38 / 10 = 3.8, we have x = 37.6 - 3.8 = 33.8 ten-card packs left with Nell. Thus, Nell has 33.8 ten-card packs more than she had before giving the baseball cards to Jeff. In summary, Nell has 33.8 additional ten-card packs and 41.8 additional dollars after giving the baseball cards to Jeff.
Response:  If Paco had 19 cakes at first and then he ate 6 more, how many did he have in total? So, the answer is 19 + 6 = 25.
"Response:  If Paco had 28 ciasteczek and he ate ""kilka"" (which means ""a few"" in Polish), then he must have eaten at least 3 ciasteczek. So, after he ate ""kilka"", he had 28 - 3 = 25 ciasteczek left. Then, he ate ""siedem"" (which means ""seven"" in Polish), so he has 25 - 7 = 18 ciasteczek left. Therefore, Paco ate 3 + 7 = 10 ciasteczek in total."
Response:  Initially, Paco had 40 ciasteczek (C1). Then he ate two (2) ciasteczek (C2), leaving him with 38 ciasteczek (C3). Later, he bought 37 more ciasteczek (C4), so now he has a total of 75 ciasteczek (C5). Therefore, the final number of ciasteczek that Paco had is 75 - 2 = 73 ciasteczek.
Response:  Paco had 25 ciasteczek and he ate 5 of them. So, the number of ciasteczek that Paco has left is: 25 - 5 = 20. Therefore, more than half of the ciasteczek that Paco bought are still left with him.
Response:  Paco had 13 ciasteczek and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he bought 36 more ciasteczek. So, in total, he has 11 + 36 = 47 ciasteczek. Therefore, Paco bought more ciasteczek than he ate.
Response:  If Paco had 40 ciasteczek and he ate 5 of them, then he has left with 40 - 5 = 35 ciasteczek.  Now, if he gave 13 of his friends, then he is left with 35 / 13 = 2 ciasteczek. So, the answer is 2 ciasteczek.
Response:  Paco had 17 ciasteczek and gave 13 to his friends. So he has 17 - 13 = 4 left. He then ate 14 ciasteczek, so now he has 4 - 14 = -10 remaining. Therefore, Paco ate more than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 12 ciasteczek and gave 21 to his friend. So, he had 12 - 21 = -9 ciasteczek left. Since he didn't eat any of them, his friend got all 21 ciasteczek.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 22 sweet pastries and 75 salty ones. If he ate 15 sweet pastries and 54 salty ones, then we can calculate how many sweet pastries Paco has left as follows: Number of sweet pastries Paco has = Initial number of sweet pastries - Number of sweet pastries eaten = 22 - 15 = 7 So, Paco has 7 sweet pastries left.
Response:  Initially, Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty ones, so together he had 9 + 6 = 15 ciasteczek. Then, he ate 36 sweet cookies, which means that after eating them, he had 36 - 9 = 27 sweet ciasteczek left. Since he also ate 3 salty ciasteczek, he now has 27 + 3 = 30 ciasteczek in total. Therefore, Paco has 30 salty ciasteczek left.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty ones initially. If he ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty ones, then he has:

Sweet cookies left = 37 - 5 = 32
Salty ones left = 11 - 2 = 9
So, Paco ate more sweet cookies than salty ones. The difference between the number of sweet cookies he ate and the number of salty ones he ate is:
Difference = Number of sweet cookies eaten - Number of salty ones eaten = 5 - 2 = 3
Therefore, Paco ate 3 more sweet cookies than salty ones."
Response:  Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty ones initially. If he ate 20 sweet cookies, then he had 8 - 20 = 6 sweet cookies left. Similarly, if he ate 34 salty cookies, then he had 6 + 34 = 40 salty cookies left. So, Paco ate more salty cookies than sweet ones. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate (34) and the number of sweet cookies he ate (20) is 14. Therefore, Paco ate 14 more salty ciasteczek than sweet ones.
Response:  If Paco had initially 37 cakes and then ate 36 of them, he must have started with 37 - 36 = 1 cake left. So, Paco has 1 cake left.
Response:  Paco had 36 ciasteczek and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 36 - 14 = 22 left. Then, he ate 10 of them, so he has 22 - 10 = 12 left. Therefore, Paco has 12 ciasteczek left.
Response:  Paco had 41 ciasteczek and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 left. He then ate 18 of them. Therefore, he has 32 - 18 = 14 ciasteczek left after eating. His friend got 9 ciasteczek from him, so his friend has 9 ciasteczek in total.
Response:  Paco had 6 ciasteczek and gave 30 to his friend. So, he has 6 - 30 = -24 left. Then, he ate 23 of them. Therefore, the number of ciasteczek that Paco gave away is 30, and the number of ciasteczek he ate is 23.
Response:  Initially, Paco had 97 sweet cookies and 34 salty ones, so together he had 97 + 34 = 131 ciasteczek. Then, after eating 15 sweet cookies and 56 salty ones, Paco had 131 - 15 = 116 ciasteczek left. Therefore, Paco had 116 ciasteczek in total.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 26 słonych ciasteczek and 17 słodkich. If he ate 14 słodkich ciasteczek, then he has 17 - 14 = 3 more sweet cakes left. Since he also ate 9 słonych ciasteczek, we can subtract this number from the initial amount of słonych ciasteczek he had (26), which gives us 26 - 9 = 17 słonych ciasteczek remaining with Paco. So, the final answer is 17.
Response:  We know that Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty ones initially. If he ate 23 salty cookies, then he has 16 (39 - 23) salty cookies left. Similarly, if he ate 32 sweet cookies, then he has 7 (32 - 25) sweet cookies left. So, the number of sweet cookies eaten more than salty ones is 7 - 16 = -9. Therefore, the answer is -9.
Response:  We know that Paco had 25 słonych ciasteczek and he ate 28 of them. So, he has 3 left (25 - 28 = 3). Now, we know that he also had 40 słodkich ciasteczek and he ate 15 of them. So, he has 25 left (40 - 15 = 25). Therefore, Paco ate more słonych ciasteczek than słodkich ones. The difference between the number of słonych ciasteczek eaten and the number of słodkich ciasteczek eaten is 28 - 15 = 13.
Response:  If Gwen received $7 and spent some money, then she had $7 - x dollars left. Since she was left with $5, we can set up an equation as follows:  7 = x + 5 where x is the amount of money Gwen spent. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:  7 = x + 5 - 5 = x Solving for x, we get: x = 2 So, Gwen spent $2. Therefore, the correct answer is: Gwen spent $2.
"Response:  We know that Gwen received $X dollars for her birthday and spent $8. So, we can write an equation:
Gwen = X - 8
We also know that after spending $8, Gwen had $6 left. Therefore, we can add $8 to both sides of the equation to get:
2X - 8 = 6
Now, let's solve for X:
2X = 6 + 8
2X = 14
X = 7
So, Gwen received $7 for her birthday."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mother and then she gave $3 away. So, she has $2 - $3 = $-1 left with herself. Now, her father gave her $4, so now she has $4 + (-1) = $3 left with herself. Therefore, Gwen still has $3 dollars left after giving $3 to someone else.
Response:  The mother gave her $8, and the father gave her $5 more, so together they gave her $13 ($8 + $5). If she spent $4, then she has $9 left from her parents ($13 - $4 = $9). So, Gwen received $9 from her mother and $9 from her father.
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mom and her dad gave her $6 more, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5) from her father and $3 from her mom.
Response:  The father gave $5 to Gwen for her birthday. Her mother gave her $7 more than that, so her mother gave $12 ($5 + $7). If Gwen spent $4 of it, then she has $8 left from her mother ($12 - $4 = $8). From her father, Gwen received $5, so in total she has $8 + $5 = $13.
Response:  The father gave $5 to Gwen and her mother gave her $2, so in total she received $7 (5 + 2). If she spent $6, then she had $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, the father gave her $5 and the mother gave her $2.
Response:  If Josh had 9 balls in his collection and lost some of them, then he has fewer than 9 balls now. We are told that he has 4 balls left, so he must have lost at least 5 balls (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had x kul in his collection and lost 21 of them, then he has x - 21 kul left. Now, if he has 12 kul, that means x = 12 + 21 = 33. So, Josh had 33 kul in his collection initially.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 kul in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 left. After that, he found 5 new kul, so he has 8 + 5 = 13 kul in his collection now. Therefore, Josh has 13 kul in his collection now.
Response:  We know that Josh had 4 kulki in his collection initially and lost 16 of them. So he had 4 - 16 = -12 kul left in his collection after losing some. Now, we also know that he found 8 new kulki. Therefore, the total number of kulki Josh has now is -12 + 8 = 6. So, Josh lost more kulki than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had 7 balls in his collection initially and lost 8 of them. So he had 7 - 8 = -1 balls less than before. Now, he found 10 new balls, so he gained 10 + 0 = 10 new balls. Therefore, the final number of balls Josh has is 7 - 1 = 6 more than what he originally had.
Response:  If Josh had 21 balls in his collection and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 balls left. So, he now has 14 balls in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 20 balls in his collection and gave 2 to Jack. So now he has 20 - 2 = 18 balls left.
Response:  Josh had 22 marbles initially and then received 20 more from Jack. So, his current number of marbles is 22 + 20 = 42 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 19 bullets in his collection earlier and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 bullets left in his collection now. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  If Josh had 22 marbles in his collection and found 13 of them, then he has 9 marbles left (22 - 13 = 9). However, the question states that he lost 5 marbles, so he actually has fewer marbles now. Therefore, the final number of marbles Josh has is 9 - 5 = 4 marbles.
Response:  We know that Josh had 15 balls in his collection and found 9 marbles. So he gained 6 (marbles) - 2 (balls lost). Therefore, he lost 4 balls more than he found. Hence, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Josh had 3 balls in his collection initially and found 6 marbles. So, he gained 6 - 3 = 3 more balls than what he already had. Now, we are told that he lost 5 balls. Therefore, the final number of balls Josh has is 3 + 5 = 8 balls.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 4 pounds of apples.  Since Marco had 19 pounds of apples, we can calculate how much he contributed to the total weight as follows:  $Marco's contribution = Total weight - (Dad's weight + Dad's contribution)$ $= 4 lb - ($15 lb + Dad's weight)$ $= 4 lb - ($15 lb + x lb)$ where 'x' is the weight of Marco's apples. Substituting the given values, we get: $= 4 lb - ($15 lb + 19 lb)$ $= 4 lb - 24 lb$ $= -20 lb$ Therefore, Marco's apples weighed -20 pounds.
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father collected 35 pounds of apples.  Marco alone weighed 13 pounds, so his father must have weighed 22 pounds (35 - 13 = 22).
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father collected 20 pounds of apples. His father had 17 pounds of apples. So, if Marco had x pounds of apples, then he would have 20 - 17 = 3 pounds of apples. Therefore, Marco had 3 pounds of apples.
Response:  The father and son together collected 50 pounds of apples (32 + 8 = 40). So their combined weight of apples is 40 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of apples (truskawki). Then, on their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds of apples, so he had 15 pounds left (3 + 12 = 15). Now, we need to find out how much did his father have initially. Since Marco lost 9 pounds, his father must have had 24 - 9 = 15 pounds of apples initially. Therefore, his father's initial weight of apples was 15 pounds.
Response:  Marco and his father together collected 36 pounds of apples (truskawki). On their way back, Marco's father lost 8 pounds of apples. So now, Marco has 12 pounds of apples left. To find out how much his father had originally, we can subtract the weight he lost from the total amount they collected: 36 - 8 = 28 pounds. Therefore, his father initially had 28 pounds of apples.
Response:  The father and son together collected 22 pounds of apples. Then, on their way back, the father found an additional 30 pounds of apples. So, now they have a total of 52 pounds (22 + 30) of apples. Therefore, the weight of the apples that Marco's father had originally was 30 pounds (52 - 22).
"Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 37 pounds of apples (Marco's apples weighed 15 pounds), then:

$$ \text{Weight of Marco's apples} = 15 \text{ pounds} $$

$$ \text{Weight of his father's apples} = 37 - 15 = 22 \text{ pounds} $$

Therefore, Marco's father's apples weigh $22$ pounds."
"Response:  If Marco and his dad together collected 30 pounds of apples (Marco's alone were 17 pounds), then we can calculate how much each person contributed to the total weight as follows:

Marco's contribution = Total weight - Weight he carried himself
= 30 lb - 17 lb
= 13 lb

So, Marco's truskawki weighed 13 pounds."
"Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 26 pounds of apples (which is equal to 13 kg), then the weight of each apple must be calculated as follows:

Weight of all apples = Total weight of apples collected / Number of apples collected
= 26 lb / 2 (number of people collecting)
= 13 kg / 2
= 6.5 kg per person

Since Marco weighed 5 kg of apples alone, his father must have weighed:

Father's weight of apples = Total weight of apples - Weight of apples carried by Marco
= 13 kg - 5 kg
= 8 kg

Therefore, his father's apples weighed 8 kg."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather berries together. The berries of Marco's father weighed 11 pounds (funt). So, if they together gathered 30 pounds of berries, then the weight of Marco's berries would be: 30 - 11 = 19 pounds. Therefore, Marco's berries weigh 19 pounds.
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then, when they got off at the next stop, new children boarded the bus, making it have 10 passengers altogether. So, now there are more than 10 children in the bus compared to before the stop. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 (10 - 2 = 5).
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children in the bus. Then, 38 children got off at the stop. So, now we have to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children. Therefore, the number of children left in the bus is:  26 - 38 = -12 Children are currently in the bus.
Response:  We know that after getting off the bus, there were still 2 children in it. So initially, there were 43 children in the bus (including the 2 who got off). Therefore, before reaching the stop, there were 43 - 2 = 41 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus and after they got off at the stop, the number of children left in the bus was 21. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children who got off = Number of children remaining in the bus.  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Number of children who got off = 21.  Now, we need to find out how many children got off from the bus at the stop. To do this, we divide the total number of children who got off (21) by the number of children who remained in the bus (21). This gives us the ratio of children who got off to those who remained in the bus, which is equal to 1:1 or 100%. Therefore, 95% of the children got off from the bus at the stop.
Response:  Before getting off at the stop, there were 41 children in the bus. After getting off, 18 children remained in the bus. So, the difference between the number of children before and after is:  41 - 18 = 23 children. Therefore, there were 23 more children in the bus before stopping than there are now.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 21 children in the bus and 10 of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is: 21 - 10 = 11. Now, we are told that ""a few"" children got on the bus at the stop. This means that some children got on the bus, but not all of them. Let's assume that half of the remaining children (i.e., 5 out of 11) got on the bus at the stop. Therefore, the total number of children who got on or remained in the bus is: 11 + (5/2) = 13. So, the answer to the question is 13."
Response:  Five children were traveling in an bus. At the stop 63 children got off the bus and some new ones boarded it. In total there were 14 children inside the bus. So, 5 - 63 = -57 children got off the bus and 14 + 63 = 77 children got on the bus. Therefore, 57 children got off the bus and 77 children got on it.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and 68 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who started their journey with the bus is: 36 + (68 - 36) = 100. Now we are told that ""a few"" children got on the bus at the stop. This means that some children got on the bus after it stopped, so let's call this number x. Therefore, the final number of children who were on the bus when it left the stop is: 100 + x. Since we also know that there were 12 children in the bus to start with, we can calculate the difference between the initial number of children on the bus and the final number as follows:  Initial number of children on bus - Final number of children on bus = 12 - (100 + x). Solving for x, we get: x = 48. So, 48 more children got on the bus than got off at the stop."
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children in the bus and 40 of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is 22 - 40 = -18. Since there are only two children remaining in the bus, they must be the ones who did not get off at any stop. Therefore, the number of children who got off at some stop is 40 - 2 = 38.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 28 children in the bus and after some of them got off, there were 30 children left in the bus. So, we can write an equation:

Number of children who got on the bus = Number of children who got off (since there are now 30 children left in the bus)

We also know that 82 children boarded the bus at the stop, so we can write another equation:

Number of children who boarded the bus = Total number of children - Number of children already in the bus

Now we have two equations and two unknowns:

Equation 1: Number of children who got on the bus = Number of children who got off

Value of x (number of children who got off): 30

Equation 2: Number of children who boarded the bus = Total number of children - Number of children already in the bus

Value of y (total number of children): 28 + 82 = 100

So, we can solve for both x and y as follows:

x = 30
y = 100

Therefore, there were 30 children who got off the bus and 100 children who boarded it, including the initial 28 children."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus and 24 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is:  
$$ Total = 23 + (24 - 8) = 23 + 16 = 39 $$
Therefore, $5$ more children got off the bus than boarded it."
Response:  If Piekarz made 133 pieces of bread and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). Now, if Baker made more than what was sold, that means Baker must have made at least 82 pieces of bread. Therefore, the answer is 82.
Response:  If the baker made 54 pieces of bread and sold some of them, then he has 13 pieces left. So, if he sold x pieces, then he has 13 - x pieces left. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 13 = x + y, where y is the number of pieces of bread that the baker sold. Now, we need to solve for y. We know that the total number of pieces of bread that the baker sold is equal to the number of pieces he had minus the number of pieces he left, so we can write another equation: x + y = 54. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 27 and y = 27. Therefore, the baker sold 27 pieces of bread.
Response:  If the baker sold 145 pieces of bread and he has 72 more pieces left, then he must have made a total of 217 pieces of bread (145 + 72 = 217). Therefore, the baker made 217 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  If Piekarz made 155 cakes and his friend bought 140 of them, then Baker had 15 - 14 = 1 more cake left. So, Baker has 1 cake left.
Response:  The baker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) remaining cakes. Then, he bought 170 new cakes, so he has 16 + 170 = 186 cakes left in his store. Therefore, the baker still has 186 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 13 cakes and sold 91 of them. So he has 40 remaining (13 - 91 = 40). Then, he bought 154 new cakes. To find out how many he bought, we need to subtract the number of cakes he already had from the total number of new cakes he bought: 154 - 40 = 114. Therefore, the baker bought 114 cakes and sold 91.
Response:  The baker made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 remaining (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new cakes. Therefore, the number of cakes he has now is 92 + 31 = 123. So, the baker sold more cakes than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 cakes and sold 75 of them. Then he made another 76 cakes. So, the total number of cakes the baker has is: 110 + 76 = 186 cakes. Therefore, the baker still has 186 cakes left.
Response:  The baker made 144 pieces of bread and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 pieces of bread. So in total, the baker made 255 pieces of bread (144 + 111). Therefore, the number of pieces of bread that the baker had more than he sold is 255 - 71 = 184.
Response:  If the baker had 149 cakes and sold 10 of them, he would have 139 cakes left (149 - 10 = 139). Then, if he sold another 90 cakes, he would be left with 49 cakes (139 - 90 = 49). So, the baker has 49 cakes left.
Response:  The baker made 7 pies and sold 15 of them. So he has 7 - 15 = 8 remaining pies. Then, he sold another 103 pieces, so he has 8 + 103 = 111 remaining pieces. Therefore, the baker has 111 cakes left.
"Response:  The baker made $126$ cakes and $48$ cookies in total. If he sold $115$ cakes and $81$ cookies, then we can calculate how many more cookies than cakes he sold as follows:

$$ \therefore \text{Number of more cookies than cakes} = \text{Total number of cookies sold} - \text{Total number of cakes sold} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \therefore \text{Number of more cookies than cakes} = 81 - 115 = -34 $$

So, the baker has $34$ fewer cookies than cakes."
Response:  The baker made 19 pieces and sold 70 of them, so he has 19 - 70 = 51 remaining pieces. He also made 131 cakes and sold 88 of them, so he has 131 - 88 = 43 remaining cakes. Therefore, the baker has more cakes than pieces.
Response:  If Piekarz made 157 cakes and sold 158 of them, then he has 1 left (since he sold more than he made). Similarly, if he made 169 cakes and sold 147 of them, then he has 22 left (again, since he sold more than he made). So, Baker sold 22 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 54 pieces of bread and sold 68 of them. So he has 68 - 54 = 14 remaining pieces of bread left to sell. Similarly, he had 143 pieces of bread initially, so he sold 143 - 14 = 129 pieces of bread in total. Therefore, the baker sold 129 pieces of bread.
Response:  If he sold 44 pieces of bread and now has 48 pieces to sell, then he had more than 44 pieces at first. So, he had 48 - 44 = 14 pieces of bread initially.
Response:  At first, the baker made 40 pieces of bread and then sold 8 of them. So, he had 32 remaining (40 - 8 = 32). Therefore, the baker produced more than what he sold, which means that he has 32 extra pieces of bread left over.
"Response:  If the friend of the baker bought 137 cakes from him and now he has made an additional 169 cakes, then the total number of cakes that the baker had initially is:

$$ Total = 137 + 169 = 306 $$
So, the baker still has $ 306$ cakes left."
Response:  The baker had 173 cakes initially and sold 86 of them. So he has 173 - 86 = 87 cakes left. Then, he bought 103 new cakes, so he has 87 + 103 = 190 cakes in total.
Response:  The baker bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 of them. So he has 78 remaining (167 - 89 = 78). Therefore, the baker bought 78 cakes and sold 78 cakes.
"Response:  The baker made 8 cakes and bought 139 new ones. He sold 145 cakes in total. So, we can calculate how many more cakes he sold than he bought as follows:

Sold - Bought = 145 - 139 = 6

Therefore, the baker sold 6 more cakes than he bought."
"Response:  The baker made 62 cakes initially and then made another 149 cakes. He sold 144 of them. So, the number of cakes left with the baker is:

Initially, he had 62 - 144 = 20 cakes left.

Therefore, the baker may still have 20 cakes in his stock."
Response:  The baker made 81 cakes first and then made another 92 cakes. So in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 cakes. Since he sold only 46 of them, that means he has 173 - 46 = 127 cakes left over. Therefore, the baker made more cakes than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 61 cakes and sold 108 of them. So he has 61 - 108 = -47 cakes left. Then, he also sold 44 more cakes, so now he has -47 - 44 = -91 cakes left. Therefore, the baker has 91 cakes left.
Response:  The baker made 56 cakes and 124 cookies in total. If he sold 104 cakes and 29 cookies, then he has 37 cakes left (56 - 104 = 37).
Response:  The baker made 52 pieces of bread and sold 102 pieces plus 94 pieces that he did not sell, so in total he sold 196 pieces of bread. Therefore, the number of pieces of bread the baker made is equal to the number of pieces of bread he did not sell minus the number of pieces of bread he sold, which is:  52 - 196 = -144. So, the baker made -144 pieces of bread.
Response:  The baker made 134 cookies and 11 more to make a total of 145 pieces (including those he sold). So if he sold 140 cookies and 92 remaining, then he must have had fewer than 134 cookies left in his inventory after selling them all. Therefore, the number of cookies that the baker has is less than 134 - 92 = 42.
Response:  The baker made 14 pies and sold 8 of them. So he has 6 left (14 - 8 = 6). Then, he made another batch of 153 pies and sold 97 of them. So he has 56 left (153 - 97 = 56). Therefore, the baker sold a total of 6 + 56 = 62 pies.
Response:  If Piekarz made 43 pieces of bread and sold 154 pieces, then he must have had 111 remaining (43 - 154 = 111). Similarly, if he made 114 cakes and sold 78, then he must have had 36 remaining (114 - 78 = 36). So, there are more cakes than bread left over after selling them. Therefore, Baker has fewer cakes than Piekarz.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 games for Nintendo and she wants to have 140 games in total, then she needs to buy additional games that are equal to 118 (140 - 22).
"Response:  If Kelly has 106 games of Nintendo and she gives away 64 matches, then we can calculate how many games are left for her as follows:

Number of games left = Total number of games - Number of matches given away
= 106 - 64
= 42

Therefore, Kelly has 42 games left after giving away 64 matches."
Response:  Initially, Kelly had 91 games of Nintendo. If she still had 92 matches, then she must have lost one game. So, the correct answer is 91 - 1 = 90.
Response:  Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To find out how many games from Nintendo she needs to give away so that she will have 12 games from Nintendo, we can divide the number of games from Nintendo she has (20) by the number of games she wants to have from Nintendo (12). So, Kelly needs to give away 5 games from Nintendo (20 / 12 = 5).
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and 132 games from Sony. To find out how many games Kelly must sell to have 31 games in total, we can subtract the number of games she has from each console: 46 (Nintendo) - 132 (Sony) = -86. So, Kelly must sell 86 games to have 31 games in total.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and she found 31 games of Nintendo, then she must give away 49 games (80 - 31 = 49) to have 6 matches. Therefore, Kelly must give away 49 games to have 6 matches.
"Response:  If Randy has k blocks and he uses 52 blocks to build a tower, then we can say that:

K = Number of blocks Randy had initially (given)
52 = Total number of blocks used to build the tower (given)

Now, let's solve for K:

K = 52 / 3 = 17

So, Randy had 17 blocks at the beginning."
Response:  If there are 97 stones and Randy used them all for building the tower, then he must have used 1 stone = 1/97 of the total number of stones. So, if there were 72 stones left after building the tower, we can calculate that Randy used 72 / 97 = 3/4 of the total number of stones. Therefore, Randy used 3/4 x 97 = 68 stones to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 14 blocks to build the tower and 11 blocks to build the house. So, we can say that he has used a total of 25 blocks (14 + 11). Therefore, there are 25 - 7 = 18 remaining blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 58 blocks to build the tower and 27 blocks to build each of the five levels of the tower. Therefore, he has used a total of 58 + (5 x 27) = 169 blocks to build the tower. Similarly, we know that he has used 53 blocks to build each of the three levels of the house. So, he has used a total of 53 + (3 x 53) = 169 blocks to build the house as well. Thus, Randy has used a total of 169 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy used 37 blocks to build the tower and 33 blocks to build the tower. So, he used more blocks to build the tower than the house. Therefore, Randy used 4 more blocks (37 - 33 = 4) to build the tower than to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy used 82 blocks to build the house and 79 blocks to build the tower. So, we can write an equation: House = 82 blocks Tower = 79 blocks To find out how many more blocks were used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower = 82 - 79 = 3 Therefore, Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy used 36 blocks to build the tower. If he had 59 blocks in total, then we can deduce that he must have used 23 blocks for something else (e.g., other structures or decorations). So, the number of blocks Randy used to build the tower is 36 - 23 = 13.
Response:  We have 20 blocks for building a house and 50 blocks for building a tower. To build a house, we need to use all 20 blocks. However, to build a tower, we only need to use 30 blocks (since we have 50 blocks but want to build a tower that is 3 times as high). Therefore, we used 10 fewer blocks to build the tower than we did to build the house. So, the answer is 10.
"Response:  We know that Randy used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks were used for the house than for the tower, we can set up an equation using these values:

House blocks = 89
Tower blocks = 63

Now, let's solve this equation to find the difference between the number of blocks used for the house and the tower:

Difference = House blocks - Tower blocks
= 89 - 63
= 26

So, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response:  If you have read 20 different books from the series ""Crazy, Stupid, School"" but haven't read any of them yet, then you must have read at least 15 books in the series (since 20 - 5 = 15)."
Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series and haven't read 8 yet, that means there are 5 more books in the series that you haven't read yet. Therefore, the number of books in the series is 13 + 5 = 18.
Response:  If you have read 12 books in the series and watched 56 movies, that means you have covered 68% of the total number of books (12/22) and 73% of the total number of movies (56/10). Therefore, there are still 6 books left for you to read (22 - 12 = 10) and 44 movies left for you to watch (10 - 56 = 44).
Response:  If there are 4 different books and 17 different films in the series, that means there are 4 x 17 = 68 different items in total.  If you have read 19 of them (books or films), then there are 68 - 19 = 49 remaining items to be read or watched. Therefore, you still need to watch 49 films.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Crazy, Stupid Love"". So, we have:

Books: 16
Films: 14

Now, let's find out how many more books than films are in the series:

Number of books - Number of films = 16 - 14 = 2

So, there are 2 more books than films in the series ""Crazy, Stupid Love""."
"Response:  If we have read 19 books in the series ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and watched 61 movies, then we can calculate how many movies are more than books as follows:

Movies - Books = (61 - 19) = 42

So there are 42 movies more than books in the series ""Crazy, Stupid, Love""."
"Response:  If we have 10 books and 11 films in the series, that means we have:

Books: 10
Films: 11

If we read 13 books and watched 12 films, then:

Books: 13 (read more than the initial 10)
Films: 12 (watched as many or fewer as the initial 11)

So, the difference between the number of books and films is:

Books - Films = 13 - 12 = 1

Therefore, you read one more book than film."
"Response:  We know that the person has read 7 books and watched 21 films from the series ""Crazy, Stupid Love School"". To find out how many more films they have watched than books, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of films. So, in this case, the difference is:  21 - 7 = 14 films. Therefore, the person has watched 14 more films than books."
"Response:  If you have read 8 books from the series "" Crazy Little Monsters School "", and there are 14 different books in the series, then you still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
Response:  We know that you have already read 4 books and watched 34 movies in the series. To find out how many more books you need to read, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books already read Number of remaining books = 19 - 4 = 15 Therefore, you still need to read 15 more books in the series.
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series. If you have read 7 books, then you still need to watch 4 more movies. Therefore, the answer is 4 movies.
"Response:  We know that the person has read 11 books and watched 40 movies from the series "" Crazy, Stupid Love School"". Therefore, we can calculate the number of books in the series as follows: Number of books = Total number of books read / Number of books read = 11 / 11 = 1 So there are 1 book more than the number of movies in the series. Now let's check if this is true or not: Number of movies = Total number of movies watched / Number of movies watched = 40 / 40 = 1 Yes, it is true! There are 1 more movie than the number of books in the series."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 different movies and 11 different books in the series ""Crazy, Stupid Love"". If you have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, how many more movies are there than books in the series?  To find out, we can simply subtract the number of books from the number of movies: 63 - 13 = 50. So, there are 50 more movies than books in the series ""Crazy, Stupid Love""."
Response:  We know that the person has read 14 films and watched 19 books. To find out how many books they have read more than films, we need to subtract the number of books they have watched from the total number of books they have read. So, in this case, the difference between the number of books read (19) and the number of films watched (14) is 5. Therefore, the person has read 5 more books than films.
"Response:  If we know that you have read 19 films and watched 16 books in the series ""Crazy, Stupid, School"", then we can calculate how many more films than books you have seen as follows:

Films - Books = Number of more films than books
= 19 - 16 = 3

So, you have seen 3 more films than books in the series ""Crazy, Stupid, School""."
Response:  If Dave won 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 7 - 2 = 5 tickets for that purpose. So, Dave used 5 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave won x number of tickets and used y to buy toys, then he has z - y tickets left. We know that x = 12 (the number of tickets Dave used) and y = 14 (the number of tickets Dave has left). So we can set up an equation: x + y = z. Solving for z, we get: z = x + y = 12 + 14 = 26. Therefore, Dave won 26 tickets in the arcade game.
"Response:  We know that Dave won 18 tickets in total. If he gave away 5 tickets for toys and 11 tickets for clothes, then we have:

Tickets given away = 5 + 11 = 16

So, Dave has 18 - 16 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  We know that Dave won 19 tickets in total and he used 12 of them to buy toys. So, he has 7 more tickets left over to use for something else. Now we are asked how many more tickets Dave used to buy toys than he did to buy clothes. To find this out, we can divide the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys (7) by the number of tickets he had left over after buying toys (7). This gives us a ratio of 1:1 or 1 ticket per 1 ticket. Therefore, Dave used an equal number of tickets to buy toys as he did to buy clothes.
Response:  We know that Dave won 13 tickets in total. He used 8 of them to buy toys and 18 more to buy clothes. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of tickets used for buying clothes = 18 - 8 = 10. Therefore, Dave used 10 more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys.
Response:  We know that Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he used 10 of them to buy toys, then he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Haley planted 14 trees in her backyard after Typhoon 9 killed them all, then we can assume that there were originally 14 + x trees in the backyard before the typhoon hit. Since Haley only planted new trees after the typhoon, it means that x trees died as a result of the storm. Therefore, the correct answer is x = 13.
"Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees in her backyard after Tornado 6 passed through and killed all of them. So, if we assume that each tree has a probability of surviving the tornado equal to its initial number (i.e., the first digit of its ID), then we can calculate the probability of each tree surviving as follows:

Tree #1: Survival probability = 0.13 (since it had an ID of 1)
Tree #2: Survival probability = 0.25 (since it had an ID of 2)
...
Tree #13: Survival probability = 0.97 (since it had an ID of 13)

Now, let's simulate the event where each tree is randomly selected from the set of 13 trees and determine whether or not it survived the tornado. For example, suppose we select Tree #4 at random. Its survival probability is 0.25, so there is a 25% chance that it survived the tornado and a 75% chance that it did not. If we repeat this process many times, we will get different outcomes for each tree, which will give us an estimate of their actual survival probabilities.

Using this approach, we can calculate the number of trees that survived the tornado as follows:

Number of surviving trees = Number of simulations x Number of trees with non-zero survival probability
= 1000 x 8 (trees with non-zero survival probability)
= 80 trees

Therefore, 80 trees survived the tornado out of the original 130 trees planted by Haley."
Response:  We know that initially, Haley had 20 trees in her backyard. After the hurricane, 4 of them were left standing. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of trees remaining = Initial number of trees - Number of trees destroyed (by the hurricane) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of trees remaining = 20 - x Where 'x' represents the number of trees destroyed by the hurricane. Since 4 trees were left standing after the hurricane, we can say that x = 16 (since 20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, 16 trees were destroyed by the hurricane.
Response:  If Haley planted trees in her backyard and after Tornado 5 passed through, there were 12 trees left standing, then we can conclude that initially, Haley had x number of trees. Since 12 trees remained after the tornado, it means that x - 12 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 36. So, initially, Haley had 36 trees in her backyard.
Response:  If Haley had 9 trees before the hurricane killed 4 of them, then she had 9 - 4 = 5 remaining trees after the hurricane. Then, she added 5 more trees, so in total, Haley has 5 + 5 = 10 trees now. Therefore, her current number of trees is 10.
"Response:  We know that initially, Haley had 12 trees in her backyard. If two of them died due to the hurricane, then the number of surviving trees is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Surviving trees = Initial number of trees - Number of dead trees}} $$

So, the answer is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Surviving trees = 12 - 2 = 10}} $$
Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in her backyard after the hurricane."
"Response:  If initially Haley had 3 trees and 13 of them died in the typhoon, then the number of surviving trees is:

Surviving trees = Initially planted trees - Number of dead trees
= 3 - 13
= -10

Therefore, only 3 trees survived the typhoon out of the initial 3 that Haley had planted."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 11 trees in total and after the hurricane only two survived. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of trees alive = Initial number of trees - Number of trees killed by the hurricane

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of trees alive = 11 - 9
= 2

Therefore, 2 trees survived the hurricane out of the initial 11 trees."
"Response:  If they collect 66 workplaces per day and each basket contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges are collected in total as follows:

Total number of oranges = Number of baskets x Number of oranges in each basket
= 66 x 28
= 1904 oranges per day
Therefore, the answer is 1904 oranges per day."
Response:  If they collect 8 works of oranges per day, it means that in one day they will collect 8/1 = 8 works. To collect 24 works of oranges, they will need to collect for 3 days, since 24 / 8 = 3.
"Response:  If they will gather for 4 days and collect altogether 56 works of oranges, then we can calculate how many works they collect per day as follows:

Number of works collected per day = Total number of works / Number of days
= 56 / 4
= 14

So, they collect 14 works of oranges per day."
Response:  After 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1752 workplaces of oranges. So, after 49 days, there will be 1752 - 38 = 1694 workplaces of oranges left to collect.
Response:  After 87 days of harvesting, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5704 workes of oranges. Since each worker contains 25 oranges, they will have 5704 / 25 = 23016 oranges.
Response:  We know that the farmers collect 8 works of oranges per day and each warehouse contains 35 oranges. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of oranges collected = 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day. Therefore, the farmers collect 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they collect 16 works per day and each bag contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will collect 16 x 57 = 902 oranges. To collect 80 bags of oranges, it will take them 80 / 902 = 8.84 days. Therefore, it will take them approximately 8.84 days to gather 80 bags of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 67 works of oranges per day and each bag contains 12 oranges, then they collect 67 x 12 = 804 oranges per day.  If they collect 35 bags of oranges, then they collect 35 x 12 = 420 oranges in total.
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 74 x 51 = 3690 work of oranges and thrown away 71 x 51 = 3621 works. So, after 51 days, they will have 3690 - 3621 = 169 works left.
Response:  We know that 76 workplaces are collected daily and 64 of them are thrown away. So, if each basket contains 50 pomegranates, then... (calculate)...the number of baskets collected is equal to the number of baskets thrown away divided by the number of pomegranates in each basket. Therefore, we have: Number of baskets collected = 76 / 50 = 1.52 baskets per day.
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 704 work of ripe oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 work of unripe oranges. So, after 26 days, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 works of orange.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 82 = 2050 work of mature oranges.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 31 x 45 = 1365 works of mature oranges and 24 x 45 = 1080 works of immature oranges. So, the total number of unripe oranges after 45 days is 1080 - 1365 = -285 works.
Response:  We know that 44 work are collected daily of mature oranges and 25 works are collected daily of immature oranges. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of mature oranges = 44 Workers collecting mature oranges per day x Total number of mature oranges Collected per day = 25 workers collecting immature oranges per day x Total number of immature oranges Collected per day Now, let's solve for the total number of mature oranges collected per day: Total number of mature oranges Collected per day = Number of mature oranges / Number of workers collecting mature oranges per day = 44/44 = 1 Therefore, there are 1 more mature orange than immature orange collected daily.
"Response:  We know that 74 work of immature oranges are collected daily and we want to find out how many more works of unripe oranges are collected than ripe ones. So, let X be the number of works of unripe oranges collected daily. Then, we have:
X + 5 = 74 (works of ripe oranges)
Now, we can solve for X:
X = 74 - 5
X = 69
So, there are 69 more works of unripe oranges collected than ripe oranges collected daily."
"Response:  If they collected 54 work of oranges in total and they were collecting 18 works per day, then we can calculate how many days it took them to collect all those oranges as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of work / Number of work collected per day
= 54 / 18
= 3

So, it took them 3 days to collect all 54 work of oranges if they were collecting 18 works per day."
Response:  If they collected 56 work of oranges in one day, then they collected $56 \times 14 = 780$ works of oranges in total during the 14 days.
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 73 x 5 = 365 work of unripe oranges and 73 x 25 = 1825 work of ripe oranges. So, the total number of work of ripe oranges after 73 days is 1825 + 365 = 2190 works.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 6 = 36 works of unripe oranges and 46 x 6 = 276 works of ripe oranges. So, the number of unripe oranges left after 6 days of harvesting is 36 - 6 = 30.
Response:  We know that 86 workds of mature oranges are collected daily and 41 works of immature oranges are collected daily. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Mature oranges = 86 Workdays Immature oranges = 41 Workdays Now, let's solve for the number of mature oranges:  Number of mature oranges = Total oranges / Number of immature oranges  Number of mature oranges = 86 / 41  Number of mature oranges = 2.07 (round to nearest whole number) Therefore, there are 2 more mature oranges than immature oranges collected daily.
Response:  We know that 71 works of unripe oranges and 60 works of ripe oranges are collected daily. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of unripe oranges = 71 Workers collecting unripe oranges per day x Number of days in a week = 60 workers collecting ripe oranges per day x Number of weeks in a year  To find out how many more unripe oranges are collected than ripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of ripe oranges from the total number of oranges collected. Therefore, we have: Total number of oranges collected = Number of unripe oranges + Number of ripe oranges = 71 x 7 = 497 + 60 = 557 oranges Collected Now, let's convert this result into a percentage increase. To do this, we divide the difference between the two numbers (unripe - ripe) by the total number of oranges collected: Percentage increase = (Number of unripe oranges - Number of ripe oranges) / Total number of oranges collected = (497 - 60) / 557 = 83% increase So, there is an 83% increase in the number of unripe oranges compared to the number of ripe oranges collected daily.
Response:  We know that Pokoj Jesse'ego has a length of 12 stopy and a width of 11 stopy. To find out how long it is compared to its width, we can divide the length by the width:  Length / Width = 12 / 11 = 1.09 (approximately) So, Pokoj Jesse'ego is approximately 10% longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that the length of Jesse's room is 7 feet (or 84 inches). The area of the carpet required is 14 square feet. So, we need to divide the area of the carpet by the length of the room to find out how wide the room is. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room = Area of carpet / Length of room = 14 sq ft / 84 in = 60 in = 5 feet.
Response:  The room is 2 meters wide, which means it is 20 square meters (2 x 10).  To find out how long the room is, we need to divide its width by the length of the divan, which is 14 feet squared. So, if the divan is 14 feet squared, then the room must be 14 / 2 = 7 feet long. Therefore, the length of the room is 7 feet or 2.13 meters.
Response:  We know that the room is 3 meters long and 5 meters wide, so its area is: Area = length x width = 3 m x 5 m = 15 square meters. Since we already have 16 square feet of carpet, we need to find out how many square feet are left to cover the entire floor: Remaining area = total area - covered area = 15 sqm - 16 sqft = 9 sqft. So, Jessie needs an additional 9 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The length of the room is 20 feet (2 \* 12 = 24 square feet). Since each tile has an area of 4 square feet, we need: Number of tiles = Area of room / Area of one tile = 24 square feet / 4 square feet = 6 tiles. Therefore, five tiles are needed to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that the room is 6 meters long and 6 meters wide, so it has an area of 36 square meters (6 x 6 = 36). Now we need to find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor of all rooms. To do this, we divide the total area of the room by the size of each tile. If we assume that one tile covers an area of 1 meter squared, then we will need 36 tiles (36 / 1 = 36) to cover the entire floor of all rooms. Therefore, the answer is 36 tiles.
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is given as 19 feet and its length is given as 20 feet. To find out how long Jesse's room is compared to its width, we can divide the length by the width:  Length / Width = 20 ft / 19 ft = 1.056 (approximately) So, Jesse's room is approximately 10% longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug with an area of 10 square feet and her room is 5 feet long. To find out how wide the room is, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Area = 5 ft x Width  Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 5 ft / 10 sq ft = 0.5 ft or 6 inches.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug with an area of 10 square feet and her room is 2 feet wide. To find out how long the room is, we can use the formula: Length = Width x Area / Square Feet. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Length = 2 x 10 / 1 = 20 feet. Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 20 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet and her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To find out how much carpet she needs to cover the entire floor, we can use the formula: Area of the room = Length x Width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 80 sq ft So, Jesse needs 80 - 18 = 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that $23$ is the amount of money earned per sold t-shirt and we also know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech they sold $230$. So, to find out how many t-shirts were sold, we can divide $230$ by $23$: $$ \frac {230} {23} = 10 $$ Therefore, they sold $10$ t-shirts.
Response:  The sklep made $51 in sales during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. If he sold 3 t-shirts, then we can calculate how much each t-shirt cost based on the total amount of money earned and the number of shirts sold. So, if the sklep made $51 in sales and sold 3 t-shirts, then each t-shirt must have cost $51 / 3 = $17 per t-shirt.
Response:  We know that for each sold t-shirt, they earned $87 dollars. So if they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they earned $4090 ($87 x 47) dollars.
Response:  We know that the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 242. Since Razorbacks earned $106 for each t-shirt sold, they made a total revenue of $242 x $106 = $25,380 from selling t-shirts during these two games. Now, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during each game separately. Let's assume that the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game is x and the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game is y. Therefore, the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is x + y = 242. Also, since Razorbacks earned $106 for each t-shirt sold during the Arkansas game, they made a total revenue of $x x $106 = $x,000 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Similarly, they made a total revenue of $y x $106 = $y,000 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Now, we can use the following equation to solve for x and y: x + y = 242 x x = $10,000 y = $24,380 Substituting y = $24,380 into the first equation, we get: x + y = 242 x = $8,000 So, Razorbacks sold 80 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and 162 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game (since y = $24,380).
Response:  During the match with Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold a total of 163 shirts. If they sold 89 shirts during the match in Arkansas, how much money did they make from selling shirts during the match in Arkansas?  We know that the profit per t-shirt is $98, so if they sold x shirts during the match in Arkansas, their profit from selling shirts during the match in Arkansas would be $98x.
Response:  During the match with Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold a total of 186 shirts. If they sold 172 shirts during the match in Arkansas, how much money did they make from selling shirts during the match in Texas Tech?  We know that the profit per t-shirt is $ 78, so if they sold x shirts during the match in Texas Tech, their profit would be $ 78x. Since they sold 186 shirts in total, we can set up the equation: $ 78x = 18600. Solving for x, we get: x = 144. So, they made $ 78 x 144 = $ 113520 from selling shirts during the match in Texas Tech.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they sold $62 for each shirt and $99 for each hoodie during the game. So, in total, they earned $62 x 183 = $11,594 from selling shirts and $99 x 31 = $3,079 from selling hoodies. Therefore, their total earnings from selling these items are $11,594 + $3,079 = $14,673.
Response:  The sklep sold $67 for each t-shirt and $165 for each hoodie. During the game, they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 hoodies. So, their total revenue from selling t-shirts is:  Total revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 74 x $67 = $4890  And their total revenue from selling hoodies is:  Total revenue = Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie = 156 x $165 = $25,340  Therefore, the sklep earned a total of $25,830 from selling both t-shirts and hoodies during the game.
Response:  The sklep razorback made $192 from each shirt and $34 from each hat. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 157 shirts and 19 hats. So, we can calculate the cost of one shirt as follows: Cost of one shirt = Total amount earned by the store / Number of shirts sold = $192 / 157 = $120 per shirt Similarly, we can calculate the cost of one hat as follows: Cost of one hat = Total amount earned by the store / Number of hats sold = $34 / 19 = $18 per hat Therefore, the cost of one shirt is more than one hat.
Response:  The cost of one shirt is $86 and $232 for another shirt. During the game, they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 hoodies. So, we have: Total revenue = Number of t-shirts x Cost per t-shirt + Number of hoodies x Cost per hoodie Total revenue = 254 x $86 + 43 x $232 Total revenue = $21,792 + $990 Total revenue = $22,782 Therefore, the price of each t-shirt is more than that of each hoodie.
Response:  The sklep sold $130 worth of shirts during the game. At a discount price of $49 per shirt, they would have generated $5,770 in revenue ($130 x $49). So, they made $5,770 in profit from selling those 130 shirts.
Response:  The sklep sold $201 worth of shirts initially and then raised the price by $217 per shirt during the game. So, they sold $217 x 14 = $2956 worth of shirts in total. Therefore, they made $2956 - $201 = $2755 in profit from selling those shirts.
"Response:  The amount of money earned from selling shirts is given as $60. If they sell each shirt for $10, then the number of shirts sold can be found using the proportion:

Number of shirts = Total amount earned / Price per shirt
= $60 / $10
= 6 shirts
Therefore, the shop sold 6 shirts during the game."
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, Razorback Store made $215 selling 5 t-shirts. To find out how much each t-shirt costs, we can divide the total amount of money earned by the number of t-shirts sold: $$ 215 = 5x $$ Now, let's solve for x : $ 43 = x $ So, each t-shirt costs $43.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money they earned from each shirt sold during the game. According to the question, they sold $5 for each Razorback T-shirt and $215 for each Texas Tech T-shirt. Therefore, they earned $5 x 20 = $100 from selling 20 Razorback T-shirts and $215 x 64 = $13,700 from selling 64 Texas Tech T-shirts. So, in total, they earned $100 + $13,700 = $13,800 from selling both types of T-shirts during the game.
"Response:  The sklep sold $76 per t-shirt and $204 per hoodie. They sold 158 t-shirts and 2 hoodies during the game. So they earned:
T-shirts: 158 x $76 = $11,932
Hoodies: 2 x $204 = $408
Total earnings from sales of t-shirts and hoodies: $11,932 + $408 = $12,340
Therefore, the sklep earned $12,340 from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game."
"Response:  The cost of each t-shirt is $21 for Arkansas and $24 for Texas Tech. If they sold 177 t-shirts for Arkansas and 23 t-shirts for Texas Tech during the game, then we can calculate their total revenue as follows:
Arkansas: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Cost per T-Shirt = 177 x $21 = $3,677
Texas Tech: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Cost per T-Shirt = 23 x $24 = $549
Now, let's find out which team earned more money from selling t-shirts:
Earnings = Total Revenue / Number of T-Shirts Sold = ($3,677 - $549) / (177 - 23) = $2,878 / 154 = $18.35 per t-shirt
So, the t-shirts sold by Arkansas cost more than those sold by Texas Tech."
"Response:  The cost of each shirt is $115 and $25 respectively. So, if they sold 113 shirts at $115 each, their total revenue would be:

$113 x $115 = $12695

If they sold 78 shirts at $25 each, their total revenue would be:

$78 x $25 = $1900

So, the total revenue from both sales combined is:

$12695 + $1900 = $14595

Therefore, the price of each shirt that was sold for more than $25 is:

$14595 / (113 - 78) = $165.69

So, each shirt that was sold for more than $25 costs approximately $165.69."
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. However, if they are planning an event with 5 sets of tables, that means there will be 5 x 10 = 50 chairs in total for all the guests to sit on. So, there will be as many chairs as tables available at the event.
"Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables with an equal number of chairs. So, if one table has x chairs, then the other table also has x chairs. Since there are 12 chairs in total, we can write the equation:
x + x = 12
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 12
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 6
So, each table has 6 chairs."
Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs on the patio and each set of tables has 3 chairs. Therefore, we have: Number of sets of tables = Number of chairs / Number of chairs per set = 9 chairs / 3 chairs/set = 3 sets of tables. So, you will have 3 sets of tables with 3 chairs each, for a total of 9 chairs.
Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then we can calculate how many chairs are in total as follows:  Total number of chairs = Number of sets x Number of chairs per set  Total number of chairs = 11 x 13  Total number of chairs = 143 chairs So there will be 143 chairs on the backyard.
Response:  We have 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs. If there are 11 people sitting in the chairs, how many chairs will be left free? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people from the total number of chairs available. So, if 11 people are sitting in the chairs, and there are 10 sets of tables with 6 chairs each, then the number of free chairs is: 10 x 6 = 60 - 11 = 49 free chairs. Therefore, 49 chairs will be left free.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Since there are also 6 additional chairs, the total number of chairs for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs. So, the answer is 174 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs. So, in total, we have 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since there will be 14 people attending the party, we need to buy an additional 2 chairs (to accommodate all guests). Therefore, the final number of chairs needed is 12 + 2 = 14 chairs.
"Response:  If they have 9 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs, then we can write this as:

9 sets of tables = 9 x 14 chairs

So, in total, there are 126 chairs (9 sets x 14 chairs per set).

Now, let's check if there are more chairs than tables:

126 chairs > 9 tables (since they have 9 sets of tables)

Therefore, there are more chairs than tables."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $460 in five weeks of collecting, then he earns:

$460 / 5 = $92 per week

So, Lewis earns $92 per week."
"Response:  If Lewis Zarabia earned $1216 during the collection, and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks it took him to collect that amount as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks

Therefore, Lewis Zarabia collected $1216 in 78 weeks."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis Zarrabia earns 21 dollars per week for 216 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income from harvesting is:

$$ Total Income = 21 \times 216 = 4536 $$

Next, we are told that he will have to pay $702 in taxes. So, his net income after taxes is:

$$ Net Income = Total Income - Taxes = 4536 - 702 = 3834 $$

Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis Zarrabia will have $3834 left after paying taxes."
Response:  Season length = 223 weeks x $1357/week = $306,410 total season income.  If he works for 73 seasons, his total income will be: Total income = $306,410 x 73 seasons = $22,397,830.
"Response: 
Lewis earns $28 per week for 109 weeks of harvesting and $939 per week during overtime hours. To calculate his total seasonal income from harvesting, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works in the harvesting season.
So, his total seasonal income from harvesting is:
$28 x 109 = $2,972
Therefore, Lewis earns $2,972 in the harvesting season."
"Response: 
Lewis Zarrabia earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income during the harvest season is:
$403 x 233 = $87,530
If he pays $49 dollars per week in rent, then his total cost during the harvest season is:
$87,530 - ($49 x 233) = $86,131
Therefore, Lewis Zarrabia makes $86,131 during the harvest season."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis Zarabia makes per week. We know that he earns $368 dollars per week because he works for 1359 weeks. Therefore, his weekly income is:
$368/week x 52 weeks/year = $18,744/year
Now, let's find out how much Lewis pays in rent each week. According to the question, he pays $388 dollars per week as rent. So, his weekly rent cost is:
$388/week
Next, we need to determine how many weeks Lewis can work during the harvest season. Based on the information provided, the harvest season lasts for 20 weeks. Therefore, the total number of weeks Lewis can work during the harvest season is:
20 weeks
Now, let's calculate how much money Lewis can make during the harvest season. Since he works for 20 weeks and earns $18,744 per year, his weekly income during the harvest season is:
$18,744/year / 20 weeks = $937/week
Finally, we need to find out how much Lewis pays in rent during the harvest season. As before, we know that he pays $388 dollars per week as rent. Therefore, his weekly rent cost during the harvest season is:
$388/week
So, the answer to the question is:
Lewis pays $937 - $388 = $549 dollars per week in rent during the harvest season."
"Response: 
Lewis Zarabia earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks of harvesting. If he has to pay $216 daily, how much will he have at the end of the season?
To find out, we need to calculate the total amount earned during the season and then subtract the daily expenses.
Total amount earned = Weekly income x Number of weeks
= $491 x 1181
= $573,073
Daily expenses = Total amount earned / Number of days in the season
= $573,073 / 365 (days in a year)
= $1575
So, at the end of the season, Lewis Zarabia will have $573,073 - $1575 = $557,398 left after paying $216 daily for 1181 weeks of harvesting."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis collected $133 in 19 weeks. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide this amount by the number of weeks: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.
"Response:  If he earns $2 per day during harvest season and earns a total of $178, then we can calculate how many days the harvest lasted as follows:

$178 = (2 x number of days)

Now, divide both sides by $2 to solve for the number of days:

number of days = ($178 / $2) = 89 days

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 89 days."
Response:  We know that Dean is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than him. So if we convert this to feet, we get: Water depth = 10 x (Dean's height) = 10 x (9) = 90 feet. Therefore, the water is 90 feet deep from Dean's position.
Response:  We know that the depth of water is twice the height of Dean. So if Dean is 8 feet tall (or 96 inches), then the depth of water is 2 times 96 = 192 inches. Since Ron is 14 feet tall (or 160 inches), we can calculate his distance from the surface as follows: Distance = Height - Depth = 160 - 192 = 72 inches. Therefore, the depth of water was 72 inches.
Response:  We know that the water is 5 times deeper than Ron's height, so if he is 12 feet tall (or 4 meters), then the depth of the water is 5 x 4 = 20 meters. Since Dean is 3 meters shorter than Ron, his height in the water would be 12 - 3 = 9 meters. So the depth of the water relative to Dean is 20 - 9 = 11 meters.
Response:  We know that after they finished swimming, the water was 15 times deeper than Dean's height. So if Dean is 4 feet tall (or 48 inches), then the depth of the water would be 15 x 48 = 720 inches or approximately 60 feet. Since Ron is 13 feet away from the water, and he is 6 feet tall (or 72 inches), we can calculate the distance between him and the surface of the water as follows: Distance = 13 - (6 / 2) = 9 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water at this point is approximately 60 - 9 = 51 feet.
Response:  We know that after they finished swimming, they were at a depth of 16 times their height below sea level. Since Ron is 9 feet tall and Dean is 7 feet tall, we can calculate their combined height as follows:  Height = 9 + 7 = 16 feet. Now, since the water is 16 times deeper than their height, we can calculate the depth of the water as follows: Depth = 16 x 16 = 256 feet. So, the water was 256 feet deep.
Response:  We know that the depth of water is 9 times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean's height is 15 feet (4.57 meters), then the depth of water is 9 \* 15 = 135 feet (40.8 meters).
Response:  If there are 34 books in total and they are placed equally on both shelves, then each shelf has 17 books (34 / 2 = 17).
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then there are 42/2 = 21 shelves in total. So, he must have 21 half-shelves.
Response:  We know that Brian looked at 27 books and 80 magazines. If he has 23 shelves, then each shelf can hold up to 80 magazines (since there are 80 magazines in total). So, if Brian has 27 books, it means he has 27/80 = 3.375 books per shelf on average. Since he has 23 shelves, he must have around 3.375 x 23 = 76.25 books in total. Therefore, Brian has approximately 76 books in his collection.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book takes up one shelf (or half-shelf), then he has 9/2 = 4.5 shelves of books. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine takes up one quarter of a shelf, then he has 46/4 = 11.5 shelves of magazines. Therefore, Brian has a total of 4.5 + 11.5 = 16 shelves of publications.
Response:  We know that Brian looked at 23 books and 61 magazines. If he had 29 shelves, then each shelf could hold an average of 61/29 = 2.14 magazines per shelf. Therefore, Brian has in total 23 x 2.14 = 48.5 books and 61 x 2.14 = 130.7 magazines. So, Brian has 48.5 + 130.7 = 179.2 books and magazines in total.
Response:  If Brian has 7 half-shelves with an equal number of books on each shelf, then he must have 7 x 28 = 184 books in total. Since there are 7 half-shelves, each half-shelf contains 184/7 = 26 books. Therefore, there are 26 books on each half-shelf.
Response:  If Brian also looked through his books and each shelf contains 2 books, then there are in total 38 books (as mentioned in the question). Since there are 10 shelves, we can calculate the number of books on each shelf as follows: Number of books per shelf = Total number of books / Number of shelves = 38 books / 10 shelves = 4 books per shelf Therefore, if Brian has 10 half-shelves, he will have 4 books on each half-shelf, which means he has a total of 4 x 10 = 40 books. So, the answer is 40.
"Response:  If Carol sent out invitations for 10 friends and each package contained 2 invitations, then she needed to send out a total of packages. Since there are 10 friends in total, we can write an equation as follows:

packages = 10
Now, let's analyze the situation further. We know that each package contains 2 invitations, so the number of invitations Carol sent out is equal to the number of packages she sent multiplied by the number of invitations per package:

invitations = packages x invitations/package
Substituting the values from the previous equation into this one, we get:

invitations = 10 x 2
Solving for the value of invitations, we find that Carol sent out a total of invitations:

invitations = 20
Therefore, Carol needed to send out at least 20 packages of invitations to ensure that no friend was left out."
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to 12 friends, and she bought 3 packages of invitations, then there must be 12 x 3 = 36 invitations in total. So, each package contains 36/3 = 12 invitations.
"Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to 20 friends (the number of pac...

Question: Carol sends birthday party invitations to her friends. Each package she bought contained 10 invitations, and she bought 7 packages in total. How many invitations did she send in total?

Answer: Based on the information provided, Carol sent a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations to her friends."
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to her friends and each package contained 14 invitations, then she must have bought 6 packages of invitations in total (since she mentions that she bought 6). Then, if she also bought 11 additional invitations, that means she has a total of 6 + 11 = 17 invitations left over after sending them all out. So, the number of friends she can invite is 17 / 14 = 12.
Response:  If Carol bought 2 packs of invitations and each pack contains 3 invitations, then she has in total 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6).  To invite 9 friends, she will need to buy additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each match, then she must have played x matches. We know that her total score is 36 points, so we can write an equation: 12x = 36. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 12: x = 36 / 12 = 3. Therefore, Melissa played 3 matches.
Response:  If Melissa scored 81 points in total and played 3 matches, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per match (81/3 = 27).
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each match and received 82 bonus points in every game. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can use the formula: Total score = Number of matches x Average score per match + Bonus points earned So, if Melissa played 79 matches, her total score would be: Total score = 79 x 109 + 82 = 8653 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, Melissa scored 8653 points in 79 matches.
Response:  If Melissa scored 7 points in each game, then she played $g$ games. Since she scored a total of 21 points, we can write an equation: $\sum_{i=1}^{g} 7 = 21$. Solving for $g$, we get $g = \frac{21}{7} = 3$. So, Melissa played $3$ games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in 13 matches, then she scored an average of 6.85 points per match (91/13). Now we need to find out how many points she scored in each match. To do this, we can divide her total score by the number of matches she played: 91 / 13 = 7.00 points per match. So, Melissa scored 7 points in each match.
Response:  We know that the circle in the park has 4 places. If 20 people can ride the bike at the same time, then each place can accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5). Therefore, there are 5 people who can be seated in each place.
"Response:  We know that the circle in the Raj Park has several places and each place can accommodate 9 people. If 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once, then we need to divide the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel by the number of places available. So, we have:
Number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel = 18
Number of places available =? (From the problem)
We are given that each place can accommodate 9 people, so the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is:
Capacity of the Ferris wheel = Number of places x Number of people per place
=? x 9
Now, we need to solve for the number of places available:
Number of places available = Capacity of the Ferris wheel / Number of people who can ride it
=? / 18
So, there are 18/9 = 2 places available on the Ferris wheel. Therefore, there are 2 places available on the Ferris wheel in the Raj Park."
Response:  We know that each circle in Paradise Park has 19 places and can accommodate 15 people per place. So, if we have 20 big circles, they will be able to accommodate 20 x 15 = 300 people at once. Therefore, 20 big circles can accommodate 300 people simultaneously.
"Response:  We know that the park has 18 places and each place can accommodate 15 people. If 10 of those places are broken or occupied by other means (e.g., swings), then we have:

Number of available places = 18 - 10 = 8

Now, let's calculate how many people can ride the big wheel at once:

Number of people who can ride the big wheel = Number of available places / 15 people per place = 8 / 15 = 26 people
Therefore, 26 people can ride the big wheel in the park at the same time if 10 places are broken or occupied by other means."
Response:  We know that the circle in Raj Park has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. So, we have a total capacity of 6 x 14 = 84 people. If there are already 16 people sitting on the circle, then we cannot add any more people because the total number of people exceeds the capacity of the circle. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small chairs in the park and they can accommodate 14 people each, so together they can accommodate 28 people. Now we have to find out how many people can ride the big wheel on the large seats. Since there are 23 large seats and each can accommodate 54 people, then altogether they can accommodate 1208 people (23 x 54). Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the big wheel is 28 + 1208 = 1236 people.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in the park. If we assume that each small seat can accommodate 16 people, then the total number of people who can sit on the small seats is:

3 x 16 = 48

Now, let's consider the large seats. Since there are 7 large seats, and each can accommodate 12 people, the total number of people who can sit on the large seats is:

7 x 12 = 84

So, in total, the number of people who can ride on the big wheel in the park is:

48 + 84 = 132

Therefore, the answer to the question is 132 people."
Response:  We know that 16 people can ride on the big wheel in Paradise Park at once. If the spinning wheel has 4 seats, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people each seat can accommodate. So, there are 4 people per seat or 4/1 = 4 seats per person.
Response:  If four people can ride on the big wheel in the Garden of Eden at the same time, and each place on the big wheel can accommodate two people, then we need to find out how many places there are on the big wheel. We know that the number of people who can ride on it at the same time is equal to the number of places available on the wheel. Therefore, if we want to determine how many places there are on the big wheel, we must divide the number of people who can ride on it simultaneously by 2. In this case, since four people can ride on the big wheel at the same time, there must be twice as many places on the wheel as there are people who can ride on it simultaneously. So, the answer is 8 places on the big wheel in the Garden of Eden.
Response:  If they ordered seven pizzas and each pizza has the same number of pieces, then there are 7 x 14 = 98 pieces in total. So, if we divide that number by 7, we get 14 pieces per pizza. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  If each pizza has two slices and there are 28 pieces in total, then we have to divide 28 by 2 to find out how many pizzas we ordered. So, the answer is 14 pizzies (28 / 2 = 14).
"Response:  If they ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then...

Total number of slices = Number of pizzas x Number of slices per pizza
= 17 x 4
= 68
Therefore, there are 68 slices in total."
Response:  If we have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are two of us, if we divide the slices equally between us, we will get 90/2 = 45 slices per person.
Response:  If Paige helped her mom plant flowers and they together planted several seeds in each flowerbed, then we can assume that there are 10 seeds in each flowerbed. Therefore, if there are 45 flowers, then there are 45 x 10 = 450 seeds in total. So, the answer is 450.
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and put them in 9 seed trays, then each seed tray contains how many seeds?  We can divide the total number of seeds (45) by the number of seed trays (9): 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per tray. So, Paige and her mom placed 5 seeds in each of the 9 seed trays.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mom plant flowers and they together sowed 36 seeds. Since only 58 seedlings grew into flowers, we can deduce that there were 58 / 12 = 4.8 seedlings per flowerpot (since each pot had 12 seeds). Therefore, there were 4.8 x 36 = 170.4 flowers in total. So, the number of flowers is 170.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mom plant 55 seeds and they together sowed them in different flower beds. Since only 60 seedlings grew into flowers, we can assume that not all of the seeds germinated equally well. So let's calculate how many seedlings grew into flowers based on the number of seeds sown: Number of seedlings = Total number of seeds x Percentage of seeds that grew into flowers  Total number of seeds = 55 (seeds sown) x 15 (nuts per kwiatowe łożo) = 725 nuts Percentage of seeds that grew into flowers = 60/725 = 0.083 or approximately 8% Therefore, out of the total number of seeds sown, 8% or 4.2 seedlings ( rounded to the nearest whole number) grew into flowers. So, there were approximately 4.2 flowers grown from the original 55 seeds.
Response:  If Paige helped her mom plant 10 seeds in each flower bed and they planted 60 seeds in total, then there will be 60/10 = 6 flowers in total. So, they had 6 flowers.
Response:  If Paige helped her mom plant flowers in 8 flowerpots and they planted 32 seeds in total, then... 1. They must have planted an equal number of seeds in each pot, since they were working together. So, if they planted x seeds in one pot, they planted x seeds in each of the other pots as well. 2. Since there are 8 flowerpots in total, we can write the equation: x + x + x +... + x = 32 (where x is the number of seeds planted in each pot). Simplifying this equation, we get: 8x = 32. Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to find out how many seeds were planted in each pot: x = 4. Therefore, Paige and her mom planted 4 seeds in each of the 8 flowerpots.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 crackers, then he had initially given them altogether 2 x 11 = 22 crackers. So, Matthew had 22 - 22 = 0 crackers left after giving away all the crackers to his friends. Therefore, Matthew had no crackers left.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 crackers to share with his friends, and he gave 2 crackers to each of them, then he gave a total of 8/2 = 4 friends crackers. So, Matthew gave 4 friends crackers in total.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 crackers and gave an equal number to his 5 friends, then he gave 3 crackers to each friend (since 5 x 3 = 15). So, each friend got 3 crackers. Since there are still 10 crackers left after they were divided among the friends, that means each friend ate 2/3 of the remaining crackers (since 10 / 3 = 2). Therefore, each friend ate 2 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 crackers and gave equal amounts to his 3 friends, then he gave 8 crackers to each friend (since 24 / 3 = 8). So, in total, Matthew gave away 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 crackers. This means that after giving them away, Matthew was left with 0 crackers. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
"Response:  If Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cookies to share among his 11 friends, we can start by dividing them equally among all of his friends:

Friend 1: 22/11 = 2 crackers
Friend 2: 22/11 = 2 crackers
...
Friend 11: 22/11 = 2 crackers

Now let's see how many crackers each friend got in total:

Friend 1: 2 + 34 = 36 crackers
Friend 2: 2 + 34 = 36 crackers
...
Friend 11: 2 + 34 = 36 crackers

So, each of Matthew's 11 friends received 36 crackers in total. Therefore, if Matthew gave an equal amount of both crackers and cookies to his friends, then he must have given 36 crackers to each friend."
Response:  If Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cookies, that means he has a total of 59 items (29 + 30 = 59).  Now, if he gave equal amounts to his friends, then each friend received 59 / 4 = 14.75 items (rounded up to 15 items per friend). So, each friend got 15 cookies and 0 crackers. Therefore, each friend zjadł 15 ciastek.
Response:  If Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cookies, that means he has in total 35 snacks (14 + 21 = 35).  Now, if he gave an equal amount of each to his seven friends, then each friend got 5 snacks (35 / 7 = 5). So, each friend ate 5 crackers and 5 cookies.
"Response:  If Matthew gave equal amounts of crackers to his 18 friends, then he must have given each friend an amount that is divisible by 18. Therefore, we can write:

Matthew = 18 x (number of crackers each friend got)

We know that Matthew had 36 crackers in total, so the number of crackers each friend got must be:

Number of crackers each friend got = Total number of crackers / Number of friends
= 36 / 18
= 2

Therefore, each friend received 2 crackers from Matthew."
Response:  If Matthew had 36 crackers and gave six to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 36 / 6 = 6 friends crackers. Therefore, Matthew gave 6 krakers to his friends.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 23 crackers and gave 11 to his two friends. So he has 23 - 11 = 12 crackers left. Now we need to divide the remaining crackers among his two friends. If each friend got an equal number of crackers, then they would have received 12 / 2 = 6 crackers each. Therefore, one friend received 6 crackers and the other friend received 6 + 6 = 12 crackers.
Response:  Matthew had 31 crackers initially and gave away an equal number of crackers to each of his 5 friends, so he has 31 - (5 x 5) = 31 - 25 = 6 crackers left after giving them away. Therefore, Matthew gave 5 of his original 31 crackers to his friends.
"Response:  If Matthew gave equal amounts of crackers and cookies to his four friends, then he must have given each friend an amount that is divisible by 4. Therefore, we can write:

Matthew gave x crackers and y cookies to each friend.

Since there are 32 crackers in total, we know that x = 32 / 4 = 8. Similarly, since there are 98 cookies in total, we know that y = 98 / 4 = 24. So, each friend got 8 crackers and 24 cookies."
Response:  If Matthew gave equal amounts of crackers and cookies to his four friends, then he had 10/4 = 2.5 times as many crackers as cookies initially (since each friend got an equal amount). So, if one friend received x crackers and y cookies, then that friend ate x/2.5 = y/4 cookies. Therefore, each friend ate y/4 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew gave equal amounts of crackers and cookies to his 28 friends, then he had a total of 13 + 15 = 28 pieces of food to distribute. Since each friend received an equal amount, each friend got 28 / 28 = 1 piece of food (either a cracker or a cookie). Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker or 1 cookie.
Response:  We know that Debbie consumed 109 bottles of water per day and there were discounts for buying in bulk. So she bought more than one batch of bottled water.  To find out how many bottles she bought, we can use the information given in the problem:  If she consumed 109 bottles per day and there were discounts for buying in bulk, then the number of days she bought bottled water is equal to the number of days she did not have to buy any bottles (since she already had enough). Therefore, if she consumed 109 bottles per day for 74 days, then she must have bought at least 35 bottles ( since she didn't need to buy any bottles for the remaining 26 days).  So, Debbie bought at least 35 bottles of water.
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale and she drank the same number of bottles every day. If each bottle lasted for 17 days, then we can calculate how many bottles Debbie drank per day as follows:

Number of bottles drunk per day = Number of bottles purchased / Total number of days (but not including the first day)
= 153 / 16
= 9.52 bottles per day
So, Debbie drank approximately 9.52 bottles of water every day."
"Response:  If she consumed 15 bottles per day for 11 days, then the total number of bottles consumed is:

15 x 11 = 165

So, Debbie consumed 165 bottles in total."
"Response:  If she consumed 144 bottles per day for several days, then we can calculate how many bottles she consumed in total as follows:

Debbie consumed x bottles per day for y days = Total number of bottles consumed

We know that Debbie consumed 301 bottles in total, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x \* y) = 301...(1)

Here, x is the number of bottles Debbie consumed per day and y is the number of days she consumed them. We are given that y = 5 days. Substituting this value into Equation (1), we get:

x + (x \* 5) = 301

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 301

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 150

So, Debbie consumed 150 bottles per day for 5 days. Therefore, she consumed a total of 750 bottles (150 bottles/day x 5 days)."
"Response:  We know that Debbie has 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda. If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of water per day, we can calculate how many days these bottles will last as follows:

Days = (Number of bottles / Daily consumption) x Number of days until empty
= (88/4) x (35 - 1)
= 290 days
Therefore, the bottles will last for approximately 290 days."
Response:  We know that Debbie has 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda. If she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 cans of gasified beverages per day, then we need to calculate how many days these gasified beverages will last her. To do this, we divide the number of gasified beverages consumed (4) by the total amount of gasified beverages available (256). This gives us a ratio of 62.5 days (4/256 = 62.5). Therefore, the gasified beverages will last Debbie for approximately 62.5 days.
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she buys 12 bottles of water, then...
"Response:  We know that Debbie has 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of water in total. If she drinks 15 bottles of water per day and 54 bottles of gasoline-based beverages per day, we can calculate how many days these bottles will last as follows:

Days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption rate
= 95 + 180 - (15 x Days) - (54 x Days)
= 95 + 180 - (230)
= -35

So, according to this calculation, the bottles will not last for any days. However, please note that this is just a fictional scenario, and it may not reflect real-world conditions or assumptions."
"Response:  We know that Debbie has 360 bottles of water and 162 bottles of water in total. If she drinks 122 bottles of water per day, then we can calculate how many days these bottles will last as follows:

Days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles consumed per day
= 360 + 162 / 122
= 45 days

So, if Debbie consumes 122 bottles of water per day, these bottles will last for approximately 45 days."
"Response:  If Faye has 11 ołówkis in each of the 14 rows, then she has a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of ołówkis} = 11 \times 14 = 154 $$
So there are $ 154 $ ołówkis in total."
Response:  We know that Faye placed 12 oak leaves in total and divided them into 3 rows. So, we can calculate how many oak leaves are in each row as follows: Row 1 has 4 oak leaves (since there are 12 - 3 = 9 oak leaves left), Row 2 has 3 oak leaves (since there are 9 - 3 = 6 oak leaves left), and Row 3 has 5 oak leaves (since there are 6 - 3 = 3 oak leaves left). Therefore, the number of oak leaves in each row is 4, 3, and 5, respectively.
Response:  If we have 28 packages of olésks and each package contains 24 olésks, then in total we have 28 x 24 = 672 olésks. Now, if Faye wants to arrange them into rows, she needs to divide this number by 16 (the number of rows she can make). So, 672 / 16 = 42 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 42 rows with her olésks.
Response:  We know that Faye had 6 packets of olive oil and each packet contained 14 olives. So, in total, she had 6 x 14 = 84 olives.
Response:  If Faye has 35 ołówków and 7 kredek, she can make 35/7 = 5 rows of ołówki. So, Faye can make 5 x 5 = 25 rows of ołówki in total.
Response:  We know that there are 19 rows and each row has either 4 ołówek or 27 kredki. So, we need to find out how many times 4 is divisible by 27.  In other words, we want to find out how many groups of 4 ołówek can be divided into 27 kredki.  To do this, we divide 27 by 4: 27 / 4 = 6.5. Since you cannot have a fraction of an ołówek or a kredka, we round up to the nearest whole number: 6 groups of 4 ołówek can be divided into 27 kredki. Therefore, there are 6 x 4 = 24 ołówek in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 rows and each row has either an olive or a pickle. So, in total, we have 7 x 3 = 21 olives and 7 x 30 = 210 pickles. Therefore, there are 21 + 210 = 231 creatures in total.
Response:  We know that there are 11 rows and each row has either an olive or a pickle. Therefore, we have a total of 11 x 3 = 33 olives and 11 x 4 = 44 pickles in all. So, the total number of olive s and pickles is 33 + 44 = 77.
"Response:  If Faye placed 30 oławki in rows with 5 oławki in each row, then we can calculate the number of rows as follows:

Number of rows = Total number of oławki / Number of oławki in each row
= 30 / 5
= 6

Therefore, Faye could have made 6 rows of oławki."
Response:  If Faye has 6 ołówków and she wants to place them in two rows, then each row will have how many ołówków?  We can divide 6 by 2 to find out that each row will have 3 ołówków. So, Faye placed 3 ołówków in each of the two rows.
Response:  We know that Faye had 35 packets of chocolates and each packet contained 4 chocolates. So, in total, she had 35 x 4 = 140 chocolates. Since she wanted to arrange them in rows with two chocolates in each row, we can divide the total number of chocolates by 2 to find out how many rows she could make: 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Faye could make 70 rows of chocolates.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packets of chalk and each packet contained 6 chalks. So, in total, she had 31 x 6 = 186 chalks. Now, we are told that she arranged her chalks in rows with 19 chalks in each row. Therefore, the number of rows she had is 186 / 19 = 9 rows. So, there were 9 rows of chalks in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 71 ołówki in total and they are arranged in 30 rows. Each row has 71 ołówkami, so we can write it as follows:

Row 1: 71 ołówki
Row 2: 71 ołówki
...
Row 30: 71 ołówki
Total number of ołówki = Number of rows x Number of ołówki in each row
= 30 x 71
= 2130 ołówkami
Therefore, there are 2130 ołówków in total."
Response:  We know that there are 6 ołówkami in each row and 21 rows in total. Therefore, the number of ołówkami is 6 x 21 = 126. Now we need to find out how many credeks there are. Since Faye placed 16 rows of ołówkami and 16 rows of credeks, the number of credeks is equal to the number of ołówkami, which is 126. So, there are 126 credeks in total.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in the school and 98 students in total. Since each class has an equal number of students (i.e., 21), we can assume that all classes have the same number of students. Therefore, the total number of students per bus is also 21. Now, let's calculate how many students can fit in each bus: The capacity of each bus is given as 7 autobusów szkolnych (autobuses). So, if we divide the total number of students by the number of buses, we get the maximum number of students who can fit in each bus: Number of students = Total number of students / Number of buses = 98 / 7 = 14 Students can fit in each bus.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and 95 buses for the trip. Since each bus has 118 seats, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of buses x Seats per bus x Number of classes  Total number of students = 95 x 118 x 84 = 76,320 students Therefore, there are approximately 76,320 students in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in total and each class has 66 students. Therefore, we have:

Number of classes = 67
Number of students per class = 66
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 67 x 66 = 4232
Now, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of places available in each bus:

Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of places in each bus = 4232 / 6 = 705
Therefore, the school needs 705 buses for the trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in the school and each class has 58 students. So, we have:

Number of classes = 87
Number of students per class = 58
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 87 x 58 = 4960
Now, since there are only two seats available in the bus, we need to divide the total number of students by two to find out how many buses are needed:

Number of buses required = Total number of students / Number of seats in each bus = 4960 / 2 = 2480
Therefore, the school needs 2480 buses for the trip."
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in total and each class has an equal number of students (120). Therefore, we can say that the number of students in one class is 120/24 = 5. So, there will be 5 students in each class. Now, let's calculate how many students will fit in each bus. There are 84 places available in each bus, so if we divide it by 5 (the number of students in each class), we get 84/5 = 16.8. Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 17 students per bus.
"Response:  We know that there are 66 classes in the school and 102 students in total. Since each class has 8 places in the buses, we need to divide the number of students by 8 to find out how many buses are needed:

Number of buses = Number of students / 8
= 102 students / 8
= 13 buses

So, if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, then 13 - 22 = 9 buses will be needed for the remaining students."
Response:  We know that there are 102 classes in the school and 11 students in total. Since 99 places are available in each bus, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of places per bus = 11 students / 99 places/bus = 1.2 buses So, if 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is: Students going on the field trip = Total number of students - Number of students who did not want to go = 102 classes - 8 students = 94 students Therefore, 94 students will go on the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students. So, we have:

Number of students = 72 x 3 = 216

Since there are only 3 seats per bus, we need at least:

Number of buses needed = Number of students / Number of seats per bus = 216 / 3 = 72

Therefore, the school needs 72 buses for the field trip."
Response:  We know that there are 46 buses and 92 students in total. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 50 students (as assumed), we have: Number of places = Total number of buses x Maximum capacity per bus = 46 x 50 = 2300 places Now, since not all buses may be full, let's assume that half of them (i.e., 23 buses) are full, leaving us with: Number of places available = Total number of buses - Number of full buses = 46 - 23 = 234 places Therefore, there are approximately 234 places for students to travel in each bus during the school trip.
Response:  If there are 9 boys in class Haley and each boy gets 9 balls, then the total number of balls is 9 x 9 = 81. So, Haley had 81 balls to distribute among the boys.
Response:  If there are 5 boys in total and each boy received 5 balls from Haley, then the number of balls given by Haley is equal to 5 x 5 = 25. Therefore, Haley gave 25 balls in total.
Response:  If there are 4 boys in total and they all like playing with marbles, then each boy will get an equal number of marbles. So if Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she will give 6 marbles (23 - 15 = 8) to each of the other 3 boys. Therefore, each boy will receive 6 marbles from Haley.
Response:  We know that in class Haley there are 13 boys who like to play with marbles and 50 boys who like to play cards. If Haley has 26 marbles, how many will each boy get? To find out, we can divide the total number of marbles (26) by the number of boys who like to play with them (13). So, each boy will get 2 marbles.
Response:  There are 20 kulki in total and there are boys in the class who like to play with them. So, we need to divide the kulki equally among the boys. Since we don't know how many boys there are, let's assume that each boy will get an equal number of kulki. Therefore, if we divide 20 kulki into equal parts, each part will contain 20/x kulki, where x is the number of boys in the class. So, each boy will get x kulki.
Response:  If there are n boys in class and each boy gets 2 balls, then the total number of balls given out is 2n. Since Haley had 28 balls to begin with, we can deduce that n = 14 (since 28 / 2 = 14). So, Haley gave 14 boys 2 balls each, for a total of 28 balls distributed.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 14 days and the book had 392 pages. So, we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows: Page = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book Page = 392 / 14 = 27 pages per day Now, let's find out how many days it took Frank to finish the book: Day = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day Day = 392 / 27 = 15 days Therefore, it took Frank 15 days to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days / Number of pages read per day Total number of days = 569 days Number of pages read per day = 22 pages/day Now, let's substitute these values into the equation: Number of pages = 569 / 22 = 25 So, there are 25 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 6 days and finished it in total of 6 days x 24 chapters = 144 chapters. So he read one chapter per day. Therefore, Frank read 144/6 = 24 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish his favorite book, which has 555 pages in total. To find out how many pages each chapter has, we can divide the number of pages by the number of chapters:  Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters  In this case, the total number of pages is 555, and there are 5 chapters. So, we can plug these values into the equation:  Number of pages per chapter = 555 / 5 = 111 pages per chapter  Therefore, each chapter in Frank's favorite book has approximately 111 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 660 days and the book had 193 pages, equally distributed into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of days by the number of chapters: 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter. So, Frank read one chapter every 44 days.
Response:  We know that Frank read 249 pages in total and it took him 3 days to finish each book. Therefore, he read 86 pages per day (249 / 3 = 86).
Response:  We know that Frank read books and each book had 66 pages. It took him 12 days to finish one book. Therefore, if it took him 492 days to finish reading all the books, he must have read $ \text {x} $ books, where $\text{x}$ is the number of days taken by Frank to finish reading all the books. $$ \begin{aligned} \frac{\text{days required to finish all books}}{\text{days required to finish one book}} &= \frac{492}{\text{12}} \\ &= \text{37} \end{aligned} $$ So, Frank read $\text{37}$ books in total.
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book (which has 112 pages), then he read at a rate of:

Pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 7 pages daily."
"Response:  If Frank reads his favorite book for 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total Pages / Daily Reading Pages
= 576 / 8
= 72 days

Therefore, Frank will need 72 days to finish reading his favorite book if he reads 8 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 30 days and each chapter had 450 pages. So, he read 450 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 450 pages/day x 30 days = 13,500 pages in total.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book in 607 days and the book has 3 chapters with 594 pages each. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Chapter 1: 594 pages / 3 chapters = 198 pages per chapter Chapter 2: 594 pages / 3 chapters = 198 pages per chapter Chapter 3: 594 pages / 3 chapters = 198 pages per chapter Therefore, each chapter has 198 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Chapters/Day = Total Chapters / Time Taken
= 2 x 405 = 810

So, Frank read 810 chapters per day."
Response:  We know that there are 6 packs of DVDs available for purchase at $120 total. To find out how much each pack costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of packs: $120 / 6 = $20 per pack. Therefore, each pack of 6 DVDs costs $20.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages will cost:

$81 x 33 = $2693

So, buying 33 packages of DVDs will cost $2693."
"Response:  If each package of DVD costs $107, then we can calculate the cost of one package as follows:

$107/package = $X per unit (where X is the number of packages)

Now, if there is a discount of $106 on each package, then we can calculate the new price of each package as follows:

New price = Original price - Discount
= $107 - ($106 x number of packages)

We are given that the total amount to be paid is $93, so we can set up an equation as follows:

Number of packages = Total amount / New price per package
= $93 / ($X per unit - $106)

Solving for X, we get:

X = $93 / ($107 - $106)
= $93 / $1
= 93

Therefore, you can buy 93 packages of DVDs at a cost of $93."
Response:  The cost of each package is $76. If there is a discount of $25 for each package, we need to find out how much we have to pay for each package. So, the total amount we have to pay = Cost of one package x Number of packages we want to buy. Total amount = $76 x??. To find out the value of?, we can use the following formula: Discount = (Original price - Sale price) / Original price. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Discount = ($76 - $51) / $76 = $25. Now, we can calculate the total amount we have to pay for each package: Total amount = $76 x $25 = $1875. Therefore, we have to pay $1875 to buy each package.
"Response:  We know that masz $104 to spend and you want to buy a DVD player. Each DVD player costs $26. So, we can calculate how many DVD players you can buy with your money as follows:
$104 / $26 = 4 DVD players
Therefore, you can buy 4 DVD players with $104."
Response:  If we have $28 to spend and we want to buy two packages of DVDs, then each package must cost less than $14. So, the cost of one package is $14.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in total and they are organized into groups of size 2. So, we need to divide 18 by 2 to find out how many groups there are.  Therefore, there are 9 groups of bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of bananas in Philip's collection as follows: Total Number of Bananas = Number of Groups x Number of Bananas per Group Total Number of Bananas = 140 x 187 = 23,800 bananas So, Philip has 23,800 bananas in his collection.
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and we want to divide them into groups of 7. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with 203 bananas. To do this, we can use division: 203 / 7 = 29. So, we can make 29 groups of 7 bananas each. Now, let's move on to the oranges. There are 63 oranges in total and we want to divide them into groups of 95. Using division again, we get: 63 / 95 = 0.66. Since you cannot have a fraction of an orange group, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1. Therefore, there will be 1 group of 95 oranges and 29 groups of 7 bananas each.
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in total.  If we divide the number of bananas by 47 (the number of groups for bananas), we get 3.04 bananas per group.  Similarly, if we divide the number of oranges by 178 (the number of groups for oranges), we get 1.91 oranges per group.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's collection of bananas. If we divide this number by the total number of bananas (392), we get: $ \frac{196}{392} = \boxed{0.5} $. So, each group contains $\boxed{5}$ bananas on average.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group and we have 180 bananas in total. So, we can divide 180 bananas into groups of size 18 as follows:

Group 1: 18 bananas (from 180)
Group 2: 17 bananas (remaining from 180 after Group 1)
...
Group 17: 16 bananas (remaining from 180 after Groups 2-16)
...
Group 153: 14 bananas (remaining from 180 after Groups 152-14)
...
Group 180: 0 bananas (no more groups possible since we have used all 180 bananas)
Therefore, there are 17 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they will be divided into two groups. Since we have 87 oranges, each group of bananas must contain at least 87/2 = 43 bananas to avoid any remaining bananas being grouped with the oranges. Therefore, each group of bananas contains 290 / 43 = 6.75 bananas. So, there are 6 groups of bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in total.  Of these, 16 oranges are organized into groups, and 345 bananas are organized into groups. So, to find out how many groups of oranges there are, we can divide the number of oranges by the number of groups they are organized into:  Number of orange groups = Total number of oranges / Number of groups of oranges = 384 / 16 = 24 groups. Therefore, each group of oranges contains 16 oranges.
Response:  If Matka Brendy prepared 38 cakes and each of them had 19 pieces, then...
Response:  If Matka Brendy made 14 pieces of cake for 14 people and each person had 30 slices, then she prepared a total of 420 slices (14 x 30 = 420).
Response:  If Matka Brendy made 22 cakes and had to throw away 17 of them, that means she had 5 cakes left. So, if there were 5 people who wanted some cake, then each person got 5/5 = 1 cake. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  If Matka Brendy prepared 18 ciasteczek and 9 guests did not come, then she had 9 ciasteczek left over. But if each guest received an equal number of ciasteczek, then the remaining 9 ciasteczek were divided among 10 guests, meaning that each guest received 0.9 ciastek (since there are 10 guests but only 9 ciasteczek left). So, each guest got approximately 0.9 ciastek.
Response:  If Matka Brendy made 14 cakes for two guests and each guest had an equal number of cakes, then the total number of cakes = Number of guests x Number of cakes per guest. So, in this case, the total number of cakes = 2 x 14 = 28. Therefore, each guest had 28 cakes.
Response:  If Matka Brendy prepared 10 ciastek and each guest had 2 ciastek, then we can calculate the number of guests as follows: Number of guests = Total number of ciastek / Number of ciastek per guest  In this case, the total number of ciastek is 10, and the number of ciastek per guest is 2, so we can plug these values into the equation: Number of guests = 10 / 2 = 5 guests Therefore, there were 5 guests at Matka Brendy's party.
Response:  If Frank had 42 pieces of candy and divided them equally between two baskets, then each basket would contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy. So, there are 21 pieces of candy in each basket.
"Response:  We know that Frank had 33 pieces of candy in each of 26 bags. So, the total number of candies he had is:

33 x 26 = 840

Therefore, Frank had 840 pieces of candy."
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 remaining pieces of candy. If he wants to distribute these pieces equally among 9 containers (workers), then each container will have 9 / 9 = 1 piece of candy. Therefore, Frank will have 9 works with 1 piece of candy in each work.
Response:  If Frank put 11 candies in each bag and he had 22 pieces of candy in total, then we can calculate how many bags he has as follows: Number of bags = Total number of candies / Number of candies per bag = 22 / 11 = 2 bags So, Frank has 2 bags of candy.
Response:  If Frank has 16 cukierków and he placed them in two bowls, then we can assume that he placed an equal number of cukierków in each bowl. So, if there are x cukierków in one bowl, then there are also x cukierków in the other bowl. Since Frank had 16 cukierków in total, the sum of the number of cukierków in both bowls must be equal to 16. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x = 16. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. So, there are 8 cukierków in each bowl.
Response:  We know that Shirley sold 25 skrzynek trefoli. If each skrzynek contains 14 pudełki, then...
Response:  We know that Shirley sold 10 boxes of trefoil. If she delivered 5 boxes to each customer, then we need to divide 10 by 5 to find out how many customers she had. So, there are 2 customers (10 / 5 = 2).
"Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in the store. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda are available, we can divide the number of regular soda bottles by the number of diet soda bottles:

Number of regular soda bottles / Number of diet soda bottles = More bottles of regular soda

Now let's plug in the values from the question into this equation:

67 / 9 = 7

So, there are 7 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
"Response:  We know that there were 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write this as an equation:

Regular soda = 22
Diet soda = 61 - 22 = 39

Now, to find out how many more diet soda bottles than regular soda bottles, we need to subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the number of diet soda bottles:

Number of more diet soda bottles = Diet soda - Regular soda = 39 - 22 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 more diet soda bottles than regular soda bottles in the store."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda in total. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of regular soda bottles + Number of diet soda bottles

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of bottles = 30 + 8

Therefore, the answer is 38 bottles (30 + 8)."
"Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Regular soda = 79
Diet soda = 53

Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda are present:

More regular soda = Total regular soda - Total diet soda
= 79 - 53
= 26

So, there are 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  We know that there are 83 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of dietetic soda in the store. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda there are, we can divide the number of regular soda bottles by the number of dietetic soda bottles:  Number of regular soda bottles = 83 Butelki zwykłe sody = 54 Butelki dietetycznej sody / 54 Butelki dietetycznej sody = 1,67 times more regular soda bottles than dietetic soda bottles Therefore, there are 1,67 times more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda in the store.
"Response:  We know that out of 17 bottles in the store, 9 are regular drinks and the rest are dietetic drinks. So, if we divide the total number of bottles by the number of regular drinks, we get the proportion of regular drinks:

Number of regular drinks = Total number of bottles / Number of regular drinks
= 17 / 9
= 2

Now, let's find out how many dietetic drinks were consumed:

Number of dietetic drinks = Total number of bottles - Number of regular drinks
= 17 - 2
= 15

So, there were 15 dietetic drinks in the store. Since each dietetic drink is equal to 30 ml, we can calculate the total volume of dietetic drinks as follows:

Total volume of dietetic drinks = Number of dietetic drinks x Volume per drink
= 15 x 30 ml
= 450 ml

Finally, since they had 29 apples, we can calculate the average amount of dietetic drink consumed per apple as follows:

Average amount of dietetic drink consumed per apple = Total volume of dietetic drinks / Number of apples
= 450 ml / 29
= 15.6 ml

Therefore, the answer is 15.6 ml."
"Response:  We know that in the store there were 19 bottles of dietetic soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda are in the store, we need to subtract the number of bottles of dietetic soda from the total number of bottles of soda:

Total number of bottles of soda = Number of bottles of dietetic soda + Number of bottles of regular soda
= 19 + 60
= 79

So, there are 79 bottles of regular soda in the store, which is 79 - 19 = 60 more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda."
Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of regular soda and 32 bottles of diet soda in the store. So, altogether we have 104 bottles (72 + 32). Now, let's find out how many apples are left. According to the question, there were 78 apples in total. Since we already counted 32 bottles of diet soda, which means we have 78 - 32 = 46 apples left. Therefore, the answer is 46.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 80 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda in the store. If we subtract the number of bottles consumed (36 jars of apples), we get:

Number of remaining bottles = Initial number of bottles - Number of bottles consumed
= 80 + 54 - 36
= 108

Therefore, there are 108 bottles left in the store."
"Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were regular drinks. So, we have:

Number of regular drinks = 28

Now, let's find out how many dietetic sodas were sold:

Dietetic sodas = Total number of bottles - Number of regular drinks
= 30 - 28
= 2

So, two bottles of dietetic soda were sold."
"Response:  We know that in the store there were 4 bottles of dietetic soda and 79 more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda. So, if we have x bottles of regular soda, then we can write an equation as follows:

x = 79 + 4

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x - 4 = 79

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

x = 83

So, there were 83 bottles of regular soda in the store."
"Response:  We know that there are 57 bottles of regular soda, 26 bottles of diet soda, and 27 bottles of sweet soda in total. So we can write an equation as follows:

Regular soda = 57
Diet soda = 26
Sweet soda = 27
Total =?

We want to find out how many bottles of each type of soda there are in total. To do this, we need to add up all the numbers of each type of soda. Therefore, we can rewrite the above equation as:

Total = Regular soda + Diet soda + Sweet soda
= 57 + 26 + 27
= 100

So there are 100 bottles of soda in total."
Response:  We know that there were 81 bottles of regular soda in total. From this information, we can calculate the number of bottles of diet soda as follows: Number of bottles of diet soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of regular soda Therefore, the number of bottles of diet soda is equal to 81 - 60, which is equal to 21. So, there are 21 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.
"Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda in the store. Therefore, we can write down the following equation:

Regular soda = 49
Diet soda = 40

Now let's find out how many bottles of water are in total:

Water = Regular soda + Diet soda
= 49 + 40
= 89

So there were 89 bottles of water in total."
"Response:  If there were 295 guests at the palace yesterday and today there are 317 guests, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = Today's number - Yesterday's number
= 317 - 295
= 22
Therefore, 22 more guests visited the palace today than yesterday."
"Response:  If there were 703 guests at the palace yesterday and today there are 246 guests, then we can calculate how many guests visited the palace in total over the past 25 days as follows:

Number of guests visiting the palace per day = Total number of guests / Number of days
= 703 / 25
= 28.1 (approximately)
So, approximately 28 guests visited the palace every day over the past 25 days."
"Response:  If 100 guests visited the palace yesterday and today there were 666 people who came, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = Today's number - Yesterday's number
= 666 - 100
= 566

Therefore, 566 more people visited the palace today than yesterday."
Response:  If 406 people visited the palace in the last 327 days and 132 guests arrived today, then we can calculate how many guests visited the palace yesterday as follows: Number of guests who visited the palace yesterday = Total number of visitors x Percentage of guests who visited yesterday / 100 So, if we assume that 40% of the total number of visitors came to the palace yesterday (which is a reasonable assumption), we get: Number of guests who visited the palace yesterday = 406 x 40/100 = 162 guests Therefore, according to the information provided in the question, 162 guests visited the Palace of Buckingham yesterday.
Response:  We know that in the last 85 days, 829 people visited the Buckingham Palace. If 45 guests arrived at the palace yesterday, then we need to find out how many visitors came to the palace on that day. To do this, we can multiply the number of guests who arrived yesterday (45) by 85, which gives us 3675 visitors who came to the palace during those 85 days. So, if 829 people visited the palace in the last 85 days and 45 people arrived yesterday, then 3675 people visited the palace yesterday.
Response:  We know that in one day (yesterday), there were 188 guests at the palace. If we multiply this number by 57 days, we get 10,696 guests for the entire period of time (57 days). Now, let's subtract the number of guests who visited the palace yesterday (188) from the total number of guests for the entire period of time (10,696): 10,696 - 188 = 10,408 guests. Therefore, during the 57-day period, 10,408 people visited the Palace of Buckingham.
"Response:  If in the previous day there were 600 visitors and now there are 661 visitors, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = New number of visitors - Old number of visitors
= 661 - 600
= 61

So, 61 more people visited the Palace Buckingham today than yesterday."
Response:  We know that 419 people visited the palace the day before and 103 people visited it the day before that. So, in total, we have: 419 + 103 = 522 people who visited the palace before today. Now, let's find out how many people visited the palace on the day of the event:  Today, 92 guests came to visit the palace. Therefore, the total number of visitors to the palace on this day is: 522 (before) + 92 (today) = 614 people.
Response:  We know that in total there were 512 guests at the palace yesterday and we also know that 471 people visited the palace the day before. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get: 512 + 471 = 983. Therefore, during the last 89 days, a total of 983 people have visited the Palace Buckingham.
Response:  We know that there were 705 guests at the palace today and we also know that there were 191 guests yesterday. So, if we subtract the number of guests from yesterday (191) from the total number of guests today (705), we get: 705 - 191 = 514 guests who visited the palace today compared to the previous 245 days.
Response:  We know that the next item on the list is wax, which connects feathers. The person needs 159 more grams of wax. If feathers require 628 grams of wax and we already have some amount of wax, how much does the person have so far?
"Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of paint to complete his list and he currently has 260 grams of wax left. So, we can calculate how much more wax he needs as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = Total amount of paint needed - Amount of wax already available
= 49 g + 260 g - 288 g
= 132 g

Therefore, he has 132 grams of wax left."
Response:  We know that he needs 57g of color and 22g of glue. So far, he has used 353g of glue. Therefore, he still has 306g (353 - 57) of glue left.
Response:  If he needs 166 grams of wax and he has only 20 grams left, then he still needs 146 grams more. So, the answer is 146 grams.
Response:  If he has 557 grams of wax and needs only 17 grams more in total, then he must have used 540 grams of wax so far to paint all his feathers. Therefore, if he has 557 - 540 = 17 grams of wax left, each feather requires 17 / 557 = 0.302 grams of wax.
"Response:  If he has 11g of wax and the feathers require 492g of wax, then we need to find out how much more wax is required. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Required wax = Total amount of wax - Amount already available
= 492g - 11g
= 481g

Therefore, the person needs an additional 481g of wax."
Response:  If there are 94 people who said they could fill 90 barrels of grapes in 6 days, that means each person can fill 15 barrels per day (94 / 6 = 15). So, the daily number of barrels filled would be 15.
Response:  If there are 266 gatherers and they can fill 90 barrels in 5 days, then we need to calculate how many barrels each person can fill per day. To do this, we divide the total number of barrels by the number of people involved:  $ Number$ of barrels = $\frac{90}{266} = 3.41$ barrels per day. Therefore, approximately $3.41$ barrels of grapes would be filled every day.
"Response:  We know that every day, 294 gatherers fill 244 barrels of grapes and 47 barrels of strawberries. To find out how many barrels of grapes are filled in 146 days, we can divide the total number of barrels filled per day by the number of days. So, 
$$ \text {Number of barrels of grapes filled} = \frac{\text{Total number of barrels filled per day}}{ \text{Number of days}} $$  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  $$ \text {Number of barrels of grapes filled} = \frac{244}{146} = 1680 $$  Therefore, in 146 days, 1680 barrels of grapes will be filled."
Response:  We know that in total there are 235 gatherers who fill 100 baskets of strawberries and 221 baskets of grapes every day. To find out how many baskets of grapes will be filled in 77 days, we can divide the number of baskets by the number of days:  Number of baskets of grapes filled per day = Total number of gatherers x Number of baskets of strawberries / Total number of days  Number of baskets of grapes filled per day = 235 x 221 / 77 = 146 baskets So, in 77 days, 146 baskets of grapes will be filled.
Response:  If he saved money by not checking the grapevines after 57 stops and 252 gatherers filled 108 barrels per day, then in 58 days: Number of barrels filled = Total number of days x Average number of barrels filled per day  Therefore, the number of barrels filled in 58 days is:  Barrels filled in 58 days = 58 x 108 = 6344 barrels.
Response:  If it takes 36 gatherers 8 days to fill 8 buckets of grapes, then it will take how many gatherers 1 day to fill 1 bucket of grapes?  To find out, we can divide 8 by 36: 8 / 36 = 0.25. So, one gatherer can fill 1/4 of a bucket of grapes in 1 day. Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for 240 buckets of grapes: 240 / 0.25 = 960 days. Therefore, it will take 960 days (or about 2.7 years) for 240 gatherers to fill 240 buckets of grapes.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium contains 52 species of saltwater fish. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of fish in all aquariums = Number of fish in each aquarium x Number of aquariums So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of fish in all aquariums = 52 x 26 = 1320 fish Now, we have to find out how many fish are in each aquarium. To do this, we divide the total number of fish by the number of aquariums: Number of fish in each aquarium = 1320 / 26 = 50 fish So, there are 50 fish in each of the 26 aquariums.
Response:  We know that there were 40 animals in total and each aquarium had 2 animals. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of Aquaria = Total number of Animals / Number of animals per Aquarium. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of Aquaria = 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquariums for marine animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium contains 39 animals. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of marine animals = Total number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium  In this case, the total number of aquariums is 56 + 10 = 66. And the number of animals per aquarium is 39. Therefore, we can substitute these values in the above equation to get:  Number of marine animals = 66 x 39 = 2744 animals.So, Tyler has 2744 marine animals in his collection.
"Response:  We know that Tyler has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Since each aquarium contains 46 animals, we can calculate the total number of animals in all the aquariums as follows:
Freshwater animals = 74 x 46 = 3380
Saltwater animals = 22 x 46 = 952
Therefore, Tyler has a total of 3380 + 952 = 4332 animals in his aquariums."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has 19 fish in it. So, we have:

Number of aquariums = 15
Number of fish per aquarium = 19
Total number of fish = Number of aquariums x Number of fish per aquarium
= 15 x 19 = 285 fish
Therefore, there are 285 fish in total."
"Response:  If we have 39 white shirts and each pack contains 13 shirts, then...

Answer: There will be 39 / 13 = 3 Pacaks."
"Response:  If Mama buys 66 white shirts and each package contains 3 white shirts, then...

Answer: There are 66 / 3 = 22 packages of white shirts."
Response:  If Mama buys 28 packages of white shirts and each package contains 56 white shirts, then we can calculate how many white shirts are in each package as follows: Number of white shirts in each package = Total number of white shirts / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 white shirts in each package.
"Response:  If we buy 57 packs of white shirts and each pack contains 53 white shirts, then we will have in total:

57 x 53 = 3019 white shirts

So, Mama will have 3019 white shirts if she buys 57 packs of them."
"Response:  If Mama buys 51 white shirts and each pack contains 3 shirts, then...

Answer:  There will be 17 packets (51 / 3 = 17)."
Response:  If Mama buys 70 white shirts and each package contains x white shirts, then the number of packages is 70 / x = 14 packages. So, the number of white shirts in each package is x = 70 / 14 = 5 white shirts per package.
Response:  We have 4 works with equal number of cookies and total amount of 36 cookies. So, we can divide it equally among all the works, which means each work will get 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9). Therefore, each worker has 9 cookies in their bag.
Response:  If you have 33 ciasteczka and each one has 11 ciasteczek inside, then...
Response:  If each basket has 41 cookies and you have 53 baskets, then the total number of cookies is:  Total number of cookies = Number of baskets x Number of cookies in each basket  Total number of cookies = 53 x 41  Total number of cookies = 2190 cookies
"Response:  We have 14 cakes and 7 bags with equal number of cakes. So, if we divide 14 cakes equally among 7 bags, each bag will contain:

14 / 7 = 2 cakes per bag"
Response:  We have 3 ciasteczka in each worker and we have 21 ciasteczek in total. So, to find out how many workers we have, we can divide the number of ciasteczek by the number of ciasteczka in each worker:  Number of workers = Total number of ciasteczek / Number of ciasteczka in each worker  Number of workers = 21 / 3  Number of workers = 7  Therefore, you have 7 works with ciasteczek.
Response:  We know that we have 26 bags with an equal number of cookies. So, if we have 15 cookies in one bag, then there are 26/15 = 1 and 7/10 bags with 1 cookie each. Similarly, if we have 52 cookies in total, then there are 52 / (1 + 7/10) = 39/40 bags with no cookies. Therefore, we have 39/40 works of cakes.
"Response:  We know that you have 14 bags with an equal number of cookies. If you have 28 cookies and 86 candies, then we can assume that each bag has an equal number of cookies and candies. So, if you have x bags of cookies, you also have x bags of candies. Since there are 14 bags in total, we can write the equation:

x + 14 = 28... (1)

We also know that there are 86 candies left over after distributing them among the bags. Therefore, the number of bags of candies is:

86 / x = 86... (2)

Now, we can solve for x using either equation (1) or (2). Solving both equations simultaneously gives us:

x = 7

So, you have 7 bags of cookies and 7 bags of candies."
Response:  If Poczta receives 5 spam messages for each block and she sends 25 letters to each house in that block, then the number of houses in one block is equal to the number of spam messages received by Poczta divided by 5. So, if Poczta receives 100 spam messages in total, then there are 100/5 = 20 blocks. Therefore, there are 20 houses in each block.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and Post receives 9 trash cans for every house, then the total number of trash cans received by Post is:

$$ \text {Total number of trash cans} = \text {Number of houses in each block} \times \text{ Number of trash cans per house} $$

= $20 \times 9$

= $180$

So, Post will receive $180$ trash cans in total."
Response:  We have 6 homes in total and each home needs 24 trash cans per block. So, we need 6 x 24 = 144 trash cans for all six homes combined. Therefore, the number of trash cans that the delivery person should deliver is 144.
Response:  If the delivery man drops 14 pieces of trash at each house in the block, then there are 14 x  number of houses = total number of pieces of trash dropped.  Since he has to give 2 pieces of trash to each block, the total number of pieces of trash given is 2 x total number of pieces of trash dropped = total number of blocks. Therefore, the number of houses in the block is total number of blocks / 2 =.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the letter carrier needs to deliver 32 trash cans to each house, then the total number of trash cans needed for all blocks is:

20 x 32 = 640 trash cans
So, the letter carrier needs to deliver 640 trash cans to each block."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Post Office receives 30 parcels to 78 blocks. Since each block has 19 houses, the total number of houses is 78 x 19 = 1426 houses in all. Therefore, the number of parcels received by each house is 30 / 1426 = 0.0215 (or approximately 2 parcels per 9 houses). So, Post Office should give 2 parcels to each of the 9 houses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Post receives 8 letters to each of the 55 blocks. So, in total, Post receives 55 x 8 = 440 letters. Now, if Post delivers 32 letters to each house in each block, then the number of houses in each block is 440 / 32 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 houses in each block.
"Response:  We know that there are 81 districts in total and each district has 12 houses. So, we have:

Number of houses = Number of districts x Number of houses per district
= 81 x 12
= 972 houses

Now, we know that Poczta (the post office) is sending 4 lists to every house. Therefore, the number of lists sent to each district is:

Number of lists per district = Total number of lists / Number of districts
= 972 / 81
= 12 lists

So, Poczta will send 12 lists to each of the 81 districts."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 districts and each district receives 4 lists from the post office. Therefore, the total number of lists received by all districts is:

$$ \text {Total number of lists} = 16 \times 4 = 64 $$

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of trash each house in the city will receive in total. Since there are 17 houses in each block, and each house receives one list from the post office, the total number of pieces of trash received by all houses in the city is:

$$ \text {Total number of pieces of trash} = 17 \times 64 = 1092 $$

Therefore, the answer to the question is $1092$."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 balls. If she wants to divide them into four groups, we need to find out how many balls each group will have. To do this, we can use division. For example, if Rebecca divides 20 balls equally among 4 groups, then each group will have 5 balls (20 / 4 = 5). So, in total, there will be 4 groups with 5 balls each. Therefore, the answer is 4.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 balls and 15 eggs. To divide them into groups of 5 each, we need to find out how many groups we can make.

We can start by dividing the eggs equally among the groups:

Group 1: 3 eggs (since there are 5 balls, we can only use 3 eggs from the total of 15)
Group 2: 4 eggs (we have 5 balls left, so we can use all 4 eggs remaining)
Group 3: 3 eggs (again, we have 5 balls left, so we can use all 3 eggs remaining)
Total number of groups = 3
So, Rebecca will be able to create 3 groups of 5 items each using her 10 balls and 15 eggs."
"Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide her collection of eggs into groups of 11 eggs each, then she will have:

$$ \text {Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of eggs in each group}} $$

Given that there are 30 eggs in total (Rebecca's collection), and each group has 11 eggs, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

$$ \begin{align\*} \text{Number of groups} &= \frac{30}{11} \\[5pt] &= 2 \end{align\*} $$

Therefore, Rebecca has 2 groups of eggs. Each group contains 11 eggs, so the total number of eggs in Rebecca's collection is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of eggs}} = 2 \times 11 = 22 $$

So, Rebecca has 22 eggs in her collection."
Response:  We have 8 eggs and 6 balls. If we divide them equally among 4 groups, each group will get... (1 egg + 2 balls) = 3 objects per group. So, there will be 3 groups with 3 eggs and 3 balls each.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 kulki and 15 jajek in total. She wants to divide them into 3 groups. So we need to find out how many jajek each group will have.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 15 (the total number of jajek) by 3 (the number of groups Rebecca wants to make).  So, if we divide 15 by 3, we get... 15 / 3 = 5.  That means each group will have 5 jajek!
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide her eggs into six groups. So we need to find out how many eggs can be divided equally among six groups.  There are 18 eggs in total, and we want each group to have an equal number of eggs. Therefore, we can divide 18 eggs equally among 6 groups as follows:  Group 1: 3 eggs Group 2: 3 eggs Group 3: 3 eggs Group 4: 3 eggs Group 5: 3 eggs Group 6: 3 eggs Now let's count the fruits and vegetables: Bananas: 72 x 6 = 432 Kul: 66 x 6 = 396 Total: 432 + 396 = 828 So there will be 828 items in total after dividing them into six groups.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of three, how many groups can she make?

1. She can give 30 bananas (3 x 10) and 3 eggs to one group.
2. She can give 35 bananas (4 x 9) and 3 eggs to another group.
3. She can give 24 bananas (3 x 8) and 3 eggs to the third group.

So, in total, Rebecca can make 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 groups. Therefore, the answer is 9."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. If she wants to divide them into groups of 5 each, how many groups can she make?  To do this, we need to divide 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4 So, Rebecca can make 4 groups of 5 eggs each or 4 x 5 = 20 eggs in total. Now let's count the number of marbles: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30 marbles In conclusion, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles, so she has 20 eggs more than 30 marbles. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More than 30 marbles
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20 each, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these resources. To do this, we will use division.  Division is a way of dividing a quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we want to divide 12 eggs into groups of 20 each. So, we will divide 12 by 20, which gives us 6 groups. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles. The correct answer is 6.
"Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and he got 11 points in each round, then we can calculate the number of rounds as follows:

Round 1: 11 points x 1 = 11 points
Total score after Round 1: 11 + 11 = 22 points
Round 2: 11 points x 2 = 22 points
Total score after Round 2: 44 + 22 = 66 points
Round 3: 11 points x 3 = 33 points
Total score after Round 3: 66 + 33 = 99 points
And so on...
Therefore, Luke played 9 rounds (or 9 times 11 points)."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds in the game and scored 46 points in each round, then he would have scored a total of:

177 x 46 = 8302 points

Therefore, Luke scored 8302 points in the game."
Response:  In round 1, Luke scored 42 points and in round 2 he scored 42 points again. So, if he scores the same number of points in each round, then he scored 42 points in each round. Therefore, Luke scored 42 + 42 = 84 points in total.
"Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of the game and played 157 rounds, then he scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$

where $x_i$ is the number of points Luke scored in the $i^{th}$ round, and $n$ is the number of rounds played (in this case, $n = 157$).

So, we can write:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{Total score} &= \sum_{i=1}^{157} 146 \\
&= 146 \times 157 \\
&= 21982
\end{aligned} $$

Therefore, Luke scored a total of 21982 points in the game."
Response:  If Luke scored 3 points in each round of the game and he played 7 rounds, then he scored a total of 3 x 7 = 21 points in those rounds. So, if he scored 78 points overall, that means he must have played more than 7 rounds. Therefore, the number of rounds Luke played is 78 / 21 = 3.6 rounds. Since you can't have a fraction of a round, we will round up to 4 rounds.
Response:  We know that Emily has 2 coral rocks and she can make 32 pendants. So, we need to divide 32 by 2 to find out how many pendants each rock will give us: 32 / 2 = 16. Therefore, Emily needs 16 coral rocks to make all 32 pendants.
"Response:  We know that Emily made 11 naszyjników and each of them contains 28 corals. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of corals = Total number of naszyjniki x Number of corals per naszyjnik To find out how many corals Emily had, we need to solve this equation for ""Number of corals"". Now let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation: Number of corals = 11 x 28 = 308 Corals Therefore, Emily had 308 corals."
Response:  If Emily has 16 coraliki and she wants to make 8 naszyjników, then each naszyjnik will have 8/16 = 5 coraliki. So, Emily can make 5 naszyjników.
Response:  We know that Emily made 18 naszyjniki and she had 6 coral beads. To find out how many coral beads are needed for each naszyjnik, we can divide the number of naszyjniki by the number of coral beads used in one naszyjnik. So, if we divide 18 (number of naszyjniki) by 6 (number of coral beads per naszyjnik), we get 3 (coral beads required for each naszyjnik). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Emily made 4 necklaces and each necklace contains 5 corals. So, the total number of corals used by Emily is:  Number of necklaces = 4  x  Number of corals per necklace = 5  Therefore, the total number of corals used by Emily is:  Total number of corals = 4 x 5 = 20  So, there are 20 corals in total.
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 coralikes and each of them can be used to make 3 necklaces. Therefore, we have: 6 coralikes x 3 = 18 necklaces in total. Since Emily wants to make one for each of her 72 friends, she will need to make 72 - 18 = 54 more necklaces. So, the final answer is 54 necklaces that Emily can make using all 6 of her coralikes.
"Response:  We know that Emily has 5 corals and she wants to make 20 necklaces for her 43 friends. To find out how many corals each necklace requires, we can divide the total number of necklaces (20) by the number of corals available to Emily (5):

Number of corals per necklace = Total number of necklaces / Number of corals available = 20 / 5 = 4
So, Emily needs 4 corals to make one necklace."
"Response:  We know that Emily made 26 naszyjników and each naszyjnik contains 2 coral pieces. Therefore, the total number of coral pieces used by Emily is:

26 naszyjników x 2 coral pieces/naszyjnik = 52 coral pieces
So, Emily had 52 coral pieces in total."
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children in the county of Lawrence and 668278 of them will stay at home during summer vacation. So, we have to find out how many children went to camp. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children in the county. Therefore, the number of children who went to camp is: 819058 - 668278 = 150777.
Response:  We know that there are 202958 children who went to camp and 777622 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than those who went to camp, we can subtract these two numbers: 202958 - 777622 = -574830. So, there are 574830 more children staying at home than those going to camp.
"Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in the county of Lawrence. If 629424 children go to camp, then the number of children left at home is:

898051 - 629424 = 270627

Therefore, 270627 children stay at home during summer vacation."
"Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in the county of Lawrence. If 274865 children stay at home during summer vacation, then we have to subtract this number from the total number of children to find out how many go to camp. So, the number of children who go to camp is:

$$ \boxed{313473 - 274865 = 38609} $$
Therefore, $38609$ children go to camp during summer vacation."
Response:  We know that in total there are 907611 children from the county of Lawrence and 455682 children who go to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children in the county = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp.  Now, let's solve for the number of children in the county:  Number of children in the county = 907611 - 455682 = 451939. Therefore, there are 451939 children in the county of Lawrence.
"Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 8000 children from Lawrence County go to camp and the remaining 74673 stay at home. So, we have:

Number of children who went to camp = 8000
Total number of children in Lawrence County = 828521

Now, let's find out how many children stayed at home:

Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp
= 828521 - 8000
= 746721

Therefore, there were 746721 children who stayed at home during summer vacation in Lawrence County."
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 61619 children from the county of Lawrence were at home, and the rest went to camp. The total number of children in the county is 91676. So, we can calculate how many children went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children at home = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, 30057 children from the county of Lawrence went to camp.
"Response:  We know that 34044 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 134867 remained at home. So, the total number of children who did not go to camp is:

134867 + 424944 = 559811

Therefore, the total number of children who were either at home or at camp is:

34044 + 559811 = 593855

So, there were 593855 children involved in the summer camp program."
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 610769 children from Lawrence County go to camp, and 590796 children stay at home. So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is: 610769 + 590796 = 1201565. Now, we are told that 22 children from other countries participated in the camp. Therefore, the total number of children in Lawrence County is: 1201565 - 22 = 1199343.
"Response:  We know that 644997 children were at home during summer vacation and 893835 children went to camp. So, we have:

644997 + 893835 = 732232

So, there are 732232 children in the county of Lawrence."
Response:  If Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total, then Jackie must have 6 apples (since 3 + 9 = 12). Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has. Therefore, the answer is:  Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers of apples is:  9 (Adam) - 10 (Jackie) = -1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:  10 - 8 = 2 Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 6 apples. If they had only 2 apples between them, then Adam would have 3 apples and Jackie would have 1 apple. But we are told that Adam has 4 more apples than he and Jackie together have, so Adam must have 5 apples (not including Jackie's 1 apple). Therefore, there are 6 - 5 = 1 apple left over, which is Jackie's apple. So, the final answer is 1 apple.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 7 jabłeks.  If they had more than 9 jabłeks, then they would have had at least 16 jabłeks (since 9 + 7 = 16). Therefore, the number of jabłeks must be between 7 and 9 inclusive. Since there are only two possible values in this range (7 and 9), we can conclude that Adam and Jackie have exactly 9 jabłeks.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 12 apples.  If Adam has 9 more apples than he and Jackie together, then Adam has 3 + 9 = 12 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 12 - 3 = 9 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has 4 + 10 = 14 apples in total. Then we are told that Adam and Jackie have together 2 apples, which means they have a total of 14 - 2 = 12 apples between them. Finally, we are told that Adam has 6 more apples than he shares with Jackie, so Adam has 12 + 6 = 18 apples in total. Therefore, Adam has 18 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples, then we can write an equation as follows:  Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, so we can write:  x = 5 + y  Now, we are also given that Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples. So, we can find out how many oranges Jackie has by subtracting the number of apples from her total fruit count:  Number of oranges = Total fruit count - Number of apples Therefore, the number of oranges Jackie has is:  Number of oranges = 89 - 11 = 78 Oranges Now, we want to find out how many apples Adam has. Since he has 5 more apples than Jackie, we can use the same equation:  Adam's number of apples = Jackie's number of apples + 5 Substituting the values we have found for Jackie's number of apples (78), we get:  Adam's number of apples = 78 + 5 = 83 Apples Therefore, Adam has 83 apples in total.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 31 cakes. Today, she baked 270 more cakes in the morning and 419 additional cakes before yesterday evening. Therefore, the total number of cakes that Helen baked is: 31 + 270 + 419 = 650 cakes. So, Helen baked 650 cakes until the previous evening.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies. Today, she baked 51 chickens and 484 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen baked 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 527 chocolate cookies and today she baked 86 more. So, in total, Helen baked 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 397 chocolate chip cookies the day before. So in total, she baked 541 chocolate chip cookies. Then, today, she baked 85 more chocolate chip cookies, so the total number of chocolate chip cookies baked by Helen is 626 (541 + 85). Finally, we are asked how many chocolate chip cookies with nuts Helen baked. The answer is none, as there is no mention of any nut-based cookies in the question. Therefore, the final answer is 626 chocolate chip cookies without nuts.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies and today she made 231 chocolate chip cookies + 237 chocolate chip cookies = 478 chocolate chip cookies in total. Therefore, Helen has baked 478 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and 46 rice cakes. Today, she baked 75 cookie-like things made of potato chips and 66 chocolate chip cookies in the morning. So, yesterday, Helen baked more chocolate cookies than today. The difference is 75 - 66 = 8 chocolate cookies that Helen baked more yesterday than today.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 with nuts. Today, she baked 280 chocolate chip cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies with nuts. So, yesterday, Helen baked more chocolate chip cookies without nuts than today. The difference is 280 - 359 = -79. Therefore, Helen baked fewer chocolate chip cookies without nuts yesterday compared to today.
Response:  We know that Katie played 81 times in DS and her friends played 59 times. So we can write an equation as follows:  Katie's plays = 81  Her friend's plays = 59 Now we need to find out how many games Katie has more than her friends. To do this, we subtract the number of plays of her friends from the number of plays of Katie:  Number of games Katie has more = 81 - 59 = 22 Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie played 91 games, her new friends played 88 games and her old friends played 53 games. So we can write an equation:  Total number of games = Number of games played by Katie + Number of games played by new friends + Number of games played by old friends.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total number of games = 91 + 88 + 53 = 232 games. Therefore, Katie's friends have a total of 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games. Since Katie also has 86 old games, in total she has 126 (new) + 86 (old) = 212 games. Therefore, the answer is 212.
Response:  We know that Katie has 84 new games and her friends have 8 new games. So together they have 92 new games (Katie + friend = 92). Now we need to find out how many old games they have in total. From the information given, Katie has 19 old games, and her friends have 69 old games, so their combined total of old games is 88 (19 + 69 = 88). Therefore, the number of new games that Katie and her friends have together is 92 - 88 = 4.
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has:  63 - 57 = 6 So, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, in total, Katie has 57 + 34 = 91 games. Now we need to compare this number with the number of games her friends have. Her friends have 39 old games, so their total number of games is 39 (old) + 34 (new) = 73 games. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends - 91 (Katie) > 73 (friends). The difference between Katie's number of games and her friend's number of games is 91 - 73 = 18 games.
Response:  We know that Fred had $60 and then he gave $33 to Jason after they worked together. So, initially, Fred had $60 - $33 = $27. Now, we know that Jason earned $33 from their work together. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned is $27 + $33 = $60. So, Jason earned $60 / 2 = $30.
Response:  We know that in the previous week, Fred had $86 and Jason had $5. Then they worked together to earn $9 more. So, their total amount of money now is: $86 + $5 + $9 = $100. Therefore, they have $100 together.
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 at first and then he made $21 after buying something (not specified). Then, Jason gave him $13. So, Fred now has $40. Next, we know that Jason had $16 initially and then he spent $33 on something (also not specified), so he now has $69. Therefore, Fred earned $40 - $16 = $24 in total during the weekend.
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 and then he spent some money during the weekend. So, his new amount of money is less than $114. Then we meet Jason who has $22. Now, they both went to the movies together and spent some more money. So, Jason's new amount of money is greater than $22. From the information given in the passage, we can conclude that Jason earned $78 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 at the beginning of the day and he spent some money on car washing. So, his new amount is less than $111. Then, Jason started working as a delivery person and earned $44. Now, their total amount of money is: $111 + $44 = $155. Therefore, they earned $44 from car washing.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $63 at the end of the day after delivering newspapers. Then, we are told that Fred made $112 from washing cars over the weekend. So, if Fred made $112 and Jason made $63, then together they made $175 ($112 + $63). Therefore, the answer is $175.
Response:  Firstly, Jason had $31 and then he delivered newspapers and now has $14 left. So, Jason earned $31 - $14 = $17 from delivering newspapers. Now, let's consider Fred. He had $78 initially and spent it all on washing cars over the weekend. So, Fred didn't earn anything from washing cars. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both Jason and Fred is $17 + $0 = $17.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 at the beginning of the weekend. Then he earned $16 for delivering newspapers and $74 for washing cars. So his total earnings from these activities were $90 ($16 + $74). Therefore, Fred made a profit of $90 - $33 = $57 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $47 and then he earned $111 from delivering newspapers, so now he has $558 ($47 + $111). Then, he earned $34 from washing cars, so his new total is $592 ($558 + $34). Therefore, Fred currently has $592.
Response:  Jessi weighed 71 kg initially and then lost 20 kg through daily running. So, her current weight is:  71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg. Therefore, Jessi currently weighs 51 kg.
"Response:  Before she started running, Jessi weighed 27 kg. If she lost 101 kg after starting to run, then her original weight must have been:

$$ Original Weight = Current Weight - Lost Weight $$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ Original Weight = 27 kg - 101 kg = -74 kg $$

So, before she started running, Jessi weighed -74 kg."
Response:  Before Jessie started running, she weighed 192 kg (126 + 66). So, her weight before starting to run was 192 kg.
"Response:  Before she started running, Jessie weighed 69 kg. If she lost 35 kg after starting to run every day, then her current weight is:

$69 \text { kg} - 35 \text{ kg} = 34 \text{ kg}$

Therefore, Jessie currently weighs $34 \text{ kg}$."
Response:  At first, Jessi weighed 114 kg. Then she started running every day and lost weight at a rate of 50 kg in the first week and 60 kg in the second week. So after two weeks, Jessi had lost a total of 110 kg (50 + 60 = 110). Therefore, her current weight is 110 kg - 114 = -3 kg.
Response:  Before she started running, Jessie weighed 9 kg. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, so her new weight is: 9 kg - 62 kg = 53 kg. In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, bringing her total loss to 193 kg (53 kg + 140 kg). So, before she started running, Jessie weighed 53 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessi weighed 92 kg initially and lost 56 kg in her first week of running. So, after one week, she weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kg. Then, in her second week, she lost another 99 kg, bringing her total weight loss to 99 + 56 = 155 kg. Therefore, after two weeks of running, Jessi weighed 155 kg - 92 kg = 63 kg.
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the cage. If 64 snakes hid themselves, then we have to subtract this number from the initial total of snakes. So, the number of snakes left unhidden is:  Number of snakes = Total number of snakes - Number of snakes that hidden = 95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, there were 31 snakes remaining unhidden in the cage.
Response:  We know that there were 93 snakes and 97 alligators in total. If 40 of them hid themselves, then we have to subtract this number from the total amount of alligators. So, the number of alligators that did not hide themselves is: 97 - 40 = 57 alligators.
Response:  We know that in total there were 3 snakes and 75 alligators hiding. If we subtract the number of snakes from the total number of animals, we get: $ 3 + 75 = 78$ Now, let's find out how many alligators did not hide themselves: $ 82 - 19 = 63$ So, there were 63 alligators that did not hide themselves.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the cage and we have to find out how many of them are not snakes or alligators.  Snakes - 24, Alligators - 51. So, the number of non-snakes/alligators = Total number of animals - Number of snakes/alligators = 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 animals other than snakes and alligators in the cage.
Response:  If farmer had 171 tomatoes yesterday and took 134 of them, he has 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left in his garden today. Then, if he takes 30 more tomatoes today, he will have 37 - 30 = 7 tomatoes left after today. So, the number of tomatoes left with the farmer after today is 7.
Response:  If farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and he picked 56 of them yesterday, then he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden yesterday. Today, he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes in his garden today.
Response:  If farmer had 90 tomatoes yesterday and picked 154, then he has 63 (90 - 154) tomatoes left today. So, if he picks 50 more tomatoes today, he will have 113 (63 + 50) tomatoes in total.
Response:  We know that farmer had initially 175 pomidors and 77 ziemniaks in his garden. If he collected 172 ziemniaks, then he has 3 pomidors left (175 - 172 = 3). So, the number of pomidors and ziemniaks farmer has after collecting 172 ziemniaks is 3 + 77 = 80.
Response:  We know that Farmer had initially 177 pomidorów and 12 ziemniaków in his garden. If he collected 53 pomidorów, then we can say that he collected x = 53 pomidorów. Now, we need to find out how many ziemniaków were left after collecting the pomodorów. Since there are 12 ziemniaków initially, and Farmer collected 53 pomidorów, the number of ziemniaków left is:  Number of ziemniaków left = Total number of ziemniaków - Number of pomidorów collected = 12 - 53 = 69 So, the final number of pomidorów and ziemniaków with Farmer is: Pomidory: 177 - 53 = 124 Ziemniaki: 12 + 69 = 81
"Response:  We know that farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in the garden initially. If he collected 137 tomatoes altogether, then we can calculate how many more he collected as follows:

Green tomatoes = Initial number of green tomatoes - Number collected = 105 - x = 0 (since all green tomatoes were collected)
Red tomatoes = Initial number of red tomatoes - Number collected = 71 - x = 64 ( since 137 - 105 = 32, and 32 / 71 = 0.45, so 64 is the nearest integer to 0.45)
Therefore, there are 64 red tomatoes left in the garden after collecting 137 tomatoes in total."
"Response:  If each large wooden plank requires two nails (since ""każda deska z drewna potrzebuje dwóch szpilów""), then John needs to use 2 x number of large wooden planks = 2 x 4 = 8 nails for the entire wall. Therefore, John needs 8 nails to attach the large wooden planks to the wall."
Response:  We know that there are 13 large planks of wood used in building the house. Each plank requires 17 nails to secure it, so we need a total of 229 nails (13 x 17 = 229). However, some smaller boards also require nails, and we don't know how many they are. So, John needs a total of 229 + X nails, where X is the number of nails required for the smaller boards.
Response:  We know that John used 11 gwoździ to pierce the big wooden boards. Each board requires 3 screws for securing, so we need to calculate how many boards John needs to use based on the number of screws he has. If John used additional 8 screws, then we also need to subtract this amount from the total number of boards needed. Therefore, the final calculation is as follows: Number of boards = Total number of screws / Number of screws per board - Additional screws used So, in this case, the calculation would be: Number of boards = 11 gwoździ x 3 szpilów/gwoździe = 33 boards - 8 szpilów = 25 boards Thus, John needs 25 boards to attach to the wall using the 11 nails provided.
Response:  We know that big boards require 15 nails and small boards require 5 nails to secure them to the wall. So if we want to attach all the boards (both big and small) to the wall, we need a total of 15 + 5 = 20 nails. Therefore, John needs 20 gwóździ to attach all the boards to the wall.
Response:  We know that each desk requires two screws for securing it to the wall. Therefore, we need 2 x 16 = 32 screws in total. So, John needs 32 gwóździ (gwóźdze) to secure all the desks to the wall.
Response:  If John uses 8 large boards made of wood to build the wall and each board requires 74 nails, then we can calculate how many nails John needs as follows: Number of boards = 8 Desk size = Large (not specified) Nail requirement per board = 74 nails Total number of nails needed = Number of boards x Desk size x Nail requirement per board = 8 x Large x 74 = 5760 nails Therefore, John needs 5760 nails to build the wall with 8 large wooden boards.
Response:  We know that there are 12 large boards and 17 small boards in total.  Large boards require 14 spikes each, so we need to calculate how many spikes are needed for all large boards together: 12 x 14 = 168 spikes. Now, let's consider the small boards. Each small board requires 25 spikes, so we need to calculate how many spikes are needed for all small boards together: 17 x 25 = 425 spikes. In total, we need 168 + 425 = 593 spikes to secure all the boards. Therefore, John needs 593 desks to build the wall.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 42 pieces of chewing gum in total. If each pack contains 3 pieces of gum, then we can find out how many packs Robin has as follows:

Number of packs = Total number of pieces of gum / Number of pieces per pack
= 42 / 3
= 14
Therefore, Robin has 14 packs of chewing gum."
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 paczkis of gum and each pack contains 23 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 43 x 23 = 1007 pieces of gum. However, we are also told that Robin has 8 additional pieces of gum, so he actually has 1007 + 8 = 1015 pieces of gum in total.
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 additional pieces of gum, so he has in total 6 + 7 = 13 pieces of gum. Since each pack contains 7 pieces of gum, we can conclude that there are 13 / 7 = 2 packs of gum that Robin has. Therefore, Robin has 2 packs of gum.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pieces of gum and 13 pieces of candy. Each piece of candy contains four pieces of gum. So, we can calculate how many pieces of gum Robin has as follows:

Number of pieces of candy = 13
Number of pieces of gum in each piece of candy = 4
Total number of pieces of gum = Number of pieces of candy x Number of pieces of gum in each piece of candy
= 13 x 4
= 52
Therefore, Robin has 52 pieces of gum."
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 pieces of gum and 45 pieces of candy. Each piece of candy contains 9 pieces of candy. So, in total, Robin has:

21 pieces of gum x 9 pieces per piece = 189 pieces of gum
45 pieces of candy x 9 pieces per piece = 395 pieces of candy
Therefore, Robin has a total of 189 + 395 = 584 pieces of candy."
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pieces of gum and 14 pieces of candy. Each piece of gum contains six pieces of candy, so...
Response:  The machine can make 3 shirts per minute. In total, 6 shirts were made. To find out how long the machine worked, we need to divide the number of shirts made by the number of shirts made per minute: 6 / 3 = 2 minutes. So, the machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes. So in 1 minute, it can make 4 shirts. Therefore, in 5 minutes, it can make 20 shirts (4 x 5).
Response:  We know that yesterday, the machine produced 9 shirts and today it produced 44 shirts. So, if we divide the number of shirts produced today by the time taken to produce one shirt, we get: Number of shirts produced per minute = Total number of shirts produced / Time taken to produce one shirt  In this case, the total number of shirts produced is 44, and the time taken to produce one shirt is 3 (as given in the question). Therefore, the number of shirts produced per minute can be calculated as follows: Number of shirts produced per minute = 44 / 3 = 14 minutes So, the machine worked for 14 minutes yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 13 shirts in total. Today, it produced 3 shirts. So, if we divide the number of shirts produced today by the time taken to produce one shirt, we get: Number of shirts produced today / Time taken to produce one shirt = 3/8 = 0.375 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 0.375 minutes in total.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 9 shirts in total. Today, it produced 8 shirts. So, if we divide the number of shirts produced today by the time taken to produce one shirt, we get: Number of shirts produced per minute = Total number of shirts produced / Time taken to produce one shirt  Number of shirts produced per minute = 8/x (where x is the time taken to produce one shirt)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of shirts produced per minute = 8/x  x = 8/Number of shirts produced per minute  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time into hours as follows: x = 8/Number of shirts produced per minute = 8/60  Therefore, the machine worked for 133.33 minutes (i.e., 8/60) to produce 8 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can make 3 shirts per minute and produced 4 shirts yesterday, then it worked for 4/3 = 1.33 minutes yesterday.  If today it made 8 shirts, then it worked for 8/3 = 2.67 minutes today. So in total, the machine worked for 1.33 + 2.67 = 4 minutes.
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts per minute. Yesterday, it worked for 12 minutes, so it produced 6 x 12 = 72 shirts yesterday. Today, it worked for 14 minutes, so it produced 6 x 14 = 84 shirts today. Therefore, in total, the machine produced 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 6 shirts per minute, and it worked for 5 minutes. So, in total, it produced 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes, so it produced 72 shirts (6 x 12 = 72). Therefore, the correct answer is 72 shirts.
"Response:  The total amount of money earned during Carnival was $165 in 5 days. If they earned the same amount every day, we can write an equation as follows:

$165 = x \* 5

Where x is the daily earnings.

Solving for x, we get:

x = $165 / 5
= $33

So, they earned $33 per day during Carnival."
Response:  The daily income from selling bracelets during Carnival was $144 per day. They were at Carnival for 22 days. Therefore, their total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Daily income x Number of days at Carnival Total earnings = $144 x 22 = $3,088 So, they earned $3,088 during Carnival.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from playing ring toss for 30 days is $420. If they earned $22 in addition to that, then the daily earnings are $13.67 ($420 + $22) / 30 = $13.67 per day. Therefore, the answer is $13.67.
Response:  In the first 44 days of carnival games, they won $382 in ring toss. If we multiply this amount by 44, we get $16,596. Then, in the remaining 10 days, they won $10,374, which is equal to $1037.40 per day. Therefore, their total earnings from carnival games were $16,596 + $1037.40 = $17,633.40.
Response:  In the first 20 days of Carnival, they won $120 + $66 = $186. So, they earned $9 per day ($186 / 20 days).
Response:  In the first 154 days of Carnival, they won $325 per day, and in the remaining 57 days, they won $114 per day. So, to find out how much they earned daily during the remaining 57 days, we need to subtract $114 from $325, which gives us $211. Therefore, they earned $211 per day during the remaining 57 days of Carnival.
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packets of cookies and 4 packets of bread. So far, we have:

Cookies: 10 packets x 5 ciastek wkażdym = 50 ciasteczek
Total number of items bought: Cookies + Bread = 50 ciasteczek + 4 packets = 54 items
Therefore, Lucy bought 54 packets of cakes."
Response:  Paczki ciasteczek = 4 x 22 = 88 Paczki ciasta = 22 x 16 = 352 Paczki czekolady = 0 (Lucy did not buy any) Total number of packs bought = 88 + 352 = 440
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of bread. So, she had x = 23 + some packages of bread. Since she also bought cakes, we can write: x = 23 + y, where y is the number of packages of cakes she bought. Now, we are told that in total, Lucy bought 27 packages of food items, so we can set up the equation: x + y = 27. Solving for y (the number of packages of cakes), we get: y = 4. Therefore, Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies, 4 packages of cakes, and some other packages of bread.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packets of bread. So she spent 2 x 8 = 16 zł for cookies and 12 x 4 = 48 zł for bread. In total, Lucy spent 16 + 48 = 64 zł. Since she had 56 zł at the end, we can deduce that she had 56 - 64 = -8 zł left after buying the food. Therefore, the correct answer is -8.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people boarded the next stop. The capacity of each bus is limited to 36 passengers. So, how many people are currently in the bus?  We can calculate this as follows:  Initial number of people = 12 People who boarded at the next stop = 4 Total number of people in the bus now = Initial number of people + Number of new passengers = 12 + 4 = 16 Therefore, there are 16 people in the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 new passengers boarded the bus and 3 got off. So, now there are 12 + 8 = 20 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got into the bus at the stop, so now there are 13 people in the bus. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train and then 8 got off at the station. So, now there are 11 - 8 = 3 people left in the train.
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents and 676 people in total. To find out how many students were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants. So, the answer is:  Number of students = Total number of participants - Number of parents = 676 - 22 = 654.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents who participated in the program, and each parent had an average of 2 children (according to the passage). Therefore, we can calculate the number of children as follows:  Number of children = Total number of participants x Average number of children per participant  Number of children = 73 parents x 2 children/parent = 146 children Now, let's add the total number of students and teachers to find out how many people were present at the program:  Total number of people = Number of children + Number of students + Number of teachers  Total number of people = 146 children + 724 students + 744 teachers = 1504 people So, there were 1504 people present at the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in total. To find out how many students were present compared to their parents, we need to divide the number of students who attended (521) by the number of parents who attended (174). So, the ratio of students to parents is 521/174 = 3.01. Therefore, there were approximately 3 times as many students as parents at the event.
"Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in the program. If we assume that each parent or student attended the program separately (i.e., not together), then the total number of people who participated in the program is equal to the sum of the number of parents plus the number of students, which is:

61 + 177 = 238

Since the program could accommodate 44 people at a time, if all 238 participants attended the program simultaneously, then the maximum number of people who could have been present in the program is:

238 / 44 = 5

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to find out how far it is from the entrance to the end of the cave. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Depth / Step Size. In this case, the step size is given as 1307 feet per step. So, if we divide the depth of the cave (919 feet) by the step size (1307 feet), we get: Distance = 919 / 1307 = 0.69 miles. Therefore, the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave is approximately 0.69 miles or 1.1 km.
Response:  We know that Jaskinia is 1218 feet deep and they are currently at 849 feet. If they move with a speed of 17 feet per minute, it means they will cover a distance of 17 x 60 = 1020 feet in one hour. So, to find out how many minutes it will take them to reach the end of the cave, we can divide the total depth of the cave (1218 feet) by their current position (849 feet): 1218 - 849 = 369 feet. Therefore, it will take them approximately 369 / 17 = 21 minutes to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We are currently at an elevation of 659 feet and need to reach an elevation of 762 feet to reach the end of the cave. To find out how much time it will take us to get there, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.  Distance = Elevation difference = 762 - 659 = 133 feet.  Speed =?  Since we don't know the exact speed at which we are climbing, let's assume a moderate pace of 100 feet per hour. Therefore, Time = Distance / Speed = 133 feet / 100 feet/hour = 1.33 hours or 8 minutes. So, it will take us approximately 8 minutes to reach the end of the cave from our current location.
"Response:  We know that: * Zupełnie jak bezpańskie koty (meaning ""just like cat"") * Lubią jeść złote rybki (meaning ""like to eat golden fish"") * Zostawiają 6 złotych rybek (meaning ""leave 6 goldfish behind"") * Paige wychowała 8 złotych rybek (meaning ""Paige raised 8 goldfish in the pond"") So, let's calculate how many złotych ryb (golden fish) are left after the cats have eaten some of them: Initially, there were 8 złotych rybek in the pond. The cats ate 6 of them, leaving 2. Now, we need to subtract the number of złotych rybek that Paige raised from the initial amount: 2 - 8 = -6 złotych rybek (golden fish) Therefore, 6 złotych rybek disappeared or were eaten by the cats."
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 minnows in the pond initially. The cats did not eat any of them. Now, we are told that there are 15 fish left in the pond. So, to find out how many goldfish were left untouched by the cats, we can subtract the number of goldfish eaten (0) from the total initial number of goldfish (7): 7 - 0 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 goldfish left in the pond after the cats finished their meal.
Response:  We know that Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 minnows in the pond initially. The cats liked to eat them, but we don't know how many of each type they ate. So, let's assume that half of the goldfish (8) were eaten by the cats, leaving Paige with 8 goldfish remaining. As for the minnows, since there are more than twice as many minnows as goldfish, we can assume that about three-quarters of the minnows (53) were eaten by the cats, leaving Paige with 14 minnows remaining. Therefore, the final number of goldfish Paige has is 8, and the final number of minnows she has is 14.
Response:  We know that Paige raised 15 goldfish in the pond and that five of them were eaten by cats. So, if we subtract the number of fish eaten (5) from the total number of fish raised (15), we get 10 remaining goldfish. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  At first, the chef had 43 jabłka and used none of them to make the cakes. Then he got 2 more jabłka. So, at this point, he has 43 + 2 = 45 jabłka left.
Response:  We know that initially the chef had 58 apples and after baking he used 35 of them. So, we can calculate how many apples are left as follows: Number of apples remaining = Total number of apples - Number of apples used = 58 - 35 = 23 Therefore, there were 23 apples left after the chef baked the cakes.
Response:  We know that initially, the chef had 40 apples and 54 pears. If he made 12 cakes using these fruits, then he used 40/12 = 3 apples for each cake. Therefore, after making 12 cakes, he had 40 - (3 x 12) = 37 apples left. Now, we are told that after making the cakes, he had 39 apples remaining. So, we can deduce that he must have used 39 - 37 = 2 apples to make the cakes. Hence, the chef used 2 apples in total.
Response:  If Adam can place 11 figures on each shelf, then he has 11 figures for every 4 shelves = 275 figures in total. Since there are 4 shelves per room and 4 rooms in total, the total number of figures that Adam can accommodate is 4 x 4 = 16 rooms. Therefore, Adam can accommodate 16 x 275 = 4375 figures in his entire house.
Response:  If Adam can place 10 figures per shelf and his room has 8 shelves, then he can accommodate 80 figures in total (10 x 8 = 80). So, there are 80 half-shelves in Adam's room.
Response:  If Adam can fit 8 figures and 10 shelves per half-wall in his room, then he has 8 x 2 = 16 spaces for shelves in total. Since his room has 4 half-walls, he has 16 x 4 = 64 spaces for shelving in total. So, there could be up to 64 objects or figures that Adam could place on those shelves.
Response:  We have 10 gardens with 544 pots in total. Each pot has 32 flowers, so we have 544 x 32 = 17,664 flowers in total. Therefore, there are 17,664 flowers in all ten gardens combined.
"Response:  We know that there are 466 garnki and each of them has 53 kwiaty. Therefore, the total number of kwiaty is:

466 x 53 = 24980

Similarly, we know that each garnk has 181 patyku. So, the total number of patyku is:

466 x 181 = 87366

Therefore, in total, there are 24980 kwiatów and 87366 patyku."
Response:  We know that there are 141 garlic cloves and each garlic clove has 71 flowers and 91 buds. So, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of garlic cloves x Number of flowers per garlic clove Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9630 flowers Therefore, there are 9630 flowers in total.
Response:  If each vase has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of vases = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per vase So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of vases = 400 / 40 = 10 We conclude that there are 10 vases.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 gummies. Since they are organized into groups of 154 each, we can find out how many groups there are as follows: Number of groups = Total number of items / Number per group = 4502 + 4276 / 154 = 309 Therefore, there are 309 groups of Skittles and gummies in Steven's collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4950 gumballs. If we assume that each group of gumballs contains an equal number of gumballs (i.e., no more than 3941), then the total number of groups is given by:

Number of groups = Total number of gumballs / Number of gumballs per group
= 4950 / 3941
= 12.26
So, there are approximately 12 groups of gumballs in Steven's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and we want to divide them into groups of size $x$. So, we can write an equation based on this information: $\boxed{896 = x \times 8}$. Now, we have two other pieces of information: $\boxed{517}$ gummies and $\boxed{90}$ lollipops. Since these are not part of the main equation, let's keep them separate for now. Finally, we want our answer to be a whole number (not a decimal), so we will round up any fractions to the nearest integer. With all this in mind, we can solve for $x$ as follows: $\boxed{896 = x \times 8} \Rightarrow x = \boxed{112}$ groups of Skittles. Therefore, each group contains $\boxed{896 / 112 = 8}$ Skittles.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class. In this case, we have: Number of classes = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in school and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class  Number of students = 304 x 75  Number of students = 22,500 Now, let's simplify this equation to find the final answer.  Therefore, there were approximately 22,500 students in total at the school.
