沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，朱莉娅和18個孩子一起玩捉迷藏。如果她星期二和10個孩子一起玩捉迷藏，那麼她在星期一和星期二中玩的孩子數量是多少？  We can start by thinking step by step. Firstly, Julia and 18 children played hide-and-seek together on Monday. If she played with 10 children on Tuesday, then how many children did she play with in total? So the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，朱莉娅和11个孩子一起玩捉迷藏。這些孩子可能是11名小學生或11名中學生等。 secondly，朱莉娅和12个孩子一起玩捉迷藏。這些孩子可能是12名小學生、12名中學生或其他人群。 now we need to compare the number of children in each group. In the first case, there are 11 children playing with 朱莉娅. In the second case, there are 12 children playing with 朱莉娅. Therefore, the difference between the two groups is 1 child. So, the answer is 1 child.
 x = 10. So, Ju Liya played with 10 children on Saturday.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  star week one and some kids play hide and seek. Week two she and 14 kids play hide and seek. If she plays with all the kids in both weeks, how many kids did she play with in total? Let's think step by step.  In week one, she played with some kids, but not all of them. So, she didn't play with 16 kids in total. The answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，朱莉娅和16个孩子一起玩捉迷藏。在星期一，她和12个孩子一起玩，那么剩下4个孩子。在星期二，她和4个孩子一起玩。因此，朱莉娅和4个孩子一起玩。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  star week one and 14 children play hide and seek. If she plays with more than 8 children on Monday, then how many children does she play with? Let's think step by step.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How many children did Julia play with on Monday? According to the problem, she played with 17 children on Monday. Now, how many children did she play with on Tuesday? The problem states that she played with 15 children on Tuesday. Finally, how many children did she play with on Wednesday? The problem does not provide any information about Wednesday. Therefore, we cannot determine how many children Julia played with on this day. In conclusion, Julia played with a total of 0 children.
 18 kids played hide and seek with Julia. Total number of kids who played hide and seek with Julia = Number of kids in Week 1 + Number of kids in Week 2 - Number of kids who played both weeks (15 + 18 - 3) = 30 kids played hide and seek with Julia in both weeks. So, there were 30 kids who played hide and seek with Julia on both weeks.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  star week one and five children play hide and seek, and the second week and nine children play. How many children played hide and seek with Julia on Monday and Tuesday? According to the problem, there are no children who played hide and seek with Julia on Monday and Tuesday. So the answer is zero. Let's think step by step.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  star week one and two children play hide and seek, week two and fourteen children play, week three and sixteen children play. How many children did she play with on Monday and Tuesday?  We need to think step by step. Let's see... On Monday, she played with 2 children (her own children). On Tuesday, she played with 16 children (the total number of children in the class). So, she played with a total of 18 children (2 + 16) over the two days.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  star week one and 9 kids play hide and seek, week two and 7 kids play, week three and 96 kids play. So, how many more kids did she have on Monday than on Tuesday? Let's think step by step. On Monday (week one), there were 9 kids playing hide and seek. On Tuesday (week two), there were 7 kids playing. So, the difference between the number of kids playing on Monday and Tuesday is 2 (9 - 7). Therefore, she had 2 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How many children did Julia play with on Monday? According to the problem, she played with 14 children on Monday. Now, how many children did she play with on Tuesday? The problem states that she played with 2 children on Tuesday. Finally, how many children did she play with on Wednesday? The problem tells us that she played with 8 children on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with more than 14 + 2 + 8 = 24 children. Therefore, the answer is none.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 星期一和8个孩子玩捉迷藏，共計8+8=16人。星期二和11个孩子玩，共計11+0=11人。星期三和9个孩子玩，共計9+0=9人。因此，在星期二和星期三之間的差別是9-11=2人。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  star week one and two have 15 children playing together, while on Wednesday only 7 children are playing. So the difference between Monday and Wednesday is 8 children (15 - 7 = 8).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How many children did Julia play with on Monday? According to the problem, she played with 13 children on Monday. Now, how many children did she play with on Tuesday? The problem states that she played with 10 children on Tuesday. Finally, how many children did she play with on Wednesday? The problem tells us that she played with 15 children on Wednesday. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children. Therefore, the answer is 40.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 星期一，朱莉娅和12個孩子一起玩捉迷藏，共花了34分鐘。而在星期二，她和14個孩子一起玩捉迷藏，也共花了34分鐘。因此，朱莉娅與多少個孩子一起玩捉迷藏？ answer： none
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 星期一和星期二都是玩捉迷藏，所以她在這兩天总共花了38个小時。如果她星期一比星期二多玩了多少孩子，那麼她在星期一中玩的孩子應該大于或等於38個。但是問題并不提供這個信息，因此無法確定她star week one 比 star week two 多少孩子。 Therefore, the answer is ""No""."
  difference = 6 - 5 = 1  Therefore, on Day Two, she played with one more child than on Day One.
 None. We need to think step by step based on the problem. On Monday, Julia and 4 children played hide-and-seek together. This means that on Monday, Julia and 4 children played hide-and-seek game together. And on Tuesday, Julia played hide-and-seek with some other children. Therefore, how many children did Julia play hide-and-seek with on Tuesday? The answer is none.
" On Monday, she played with 6 children, and on Thursday, she played with 4 children. So, there are 2 fewer children playing with her on Thursday than on Monday. Therefore, the answer is ""0""."
 x = 18 So, Bobby initial
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby 吃了 28 块糖果，接著又吃了 42 块，最後還吃了 63 块巧克力。如果 Bobby 吃了 63 块巧克力，那 значи Bobby 已經吃了 155 块糖果（63 + 28 + 42）。因此，Bobby 吃了 155 块糖果。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby 吃了 33 块糖果，這就是第一個食物。接下來，他又吃了 4 块糖果，這使得 Bobby 現在擁有 37 块糖果（33 + 4）。最後，他又吃了 14 块巧克力，這使得 Bobby 現在擁有 51 块糖果和巧克力（37 + 14）。因此，Bobby 总共吃了 51 块糖果和巧克力。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby 吃了 38 块糖果，然後又吃了 36 块糖果，共計 74 块糖果。接下來，Bobby 吃了 16 块巧克力。如果 Bobby 吃了多少块糖果比巧克力多？那麼 Bobby 吃了 58 块糖果（74 - 16）。因此，Bobby 吃了多少块糖果比巧克力多？是 58 块。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby有20块糖果，他吃了34块糖果，那麼 Bobby現在有20-34=7块糖果 left.  Then he ate another 18 pieces, so now he has 7+18=25块糖果. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 25块糖果.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby initially had 21 pieces of candy. He ate 5 pieces, leaving him with 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy. Then he ate another 9 pieces, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy left. Therefore, there are 7 pieces of candy left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby initially had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some of them and then he ate another 5 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of candy that Bobby ate is 5 (the amount he ate after he already had some). Therefore, there are still 17 pieces of candy left (22 - 5 = 17).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby有19块糖果，如果他吃了2块糖果，那么Bobby現在 left with 19 - 2 = 17块糖果。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby有32块糖果。如果他吃了一些糖果，那么他現在有的糖果就是32 - X，其中X是Bobby吃了的幾個块糖果。如果他剩下20块糖果，那么他吃了的糖果就是20 - X，其中X是Bobby吃了的幾個块糖果。因此，Bobby吃了的糖果是20 - (32 - X) = ?  We can start by reasoning that if Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, then he must have had less than 32 pieces of candy left after eating. So, the number of pieces of candy he ate is equal to the difference between the total number of pieces of candy he had and the number of pieces he had left after eating. In this case, the total number of pieces of candy was 32, and the number of pieces he had left after eating is 20, so the number of pieces he ate is equal to 32 - 20 = 12. Therefore, Bobby ate 12 pieces of candy.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby 吃了 17 块糖果，這就是 S 的部分。  Then he ate another 15 pieces, which is equal to M 的部分。 So the total number of pieces of candy that Bobby has eaten is SM = 17 + 15 = 32 pieces. Now we need to find out how many pieces of candy Bobby still has left. Since he had 36 pieces of candy initially, and he ate 32 pieces, then he still has 36 - 32 = 4 pieces of candy left. Therefore, the answer is 4 pieces of candy.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Bobby 吃了 23 块糖果，那麼 Bobby 最初有 30 块糖果。如果 Bobby 吃了 23 块糖果，那麼 Bobby 現在有 30 - 23 = 7 块糖果 left. So the answer is 7.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Allen brought 2 balls to the park and Jack brought 3 balls to the park. So, in total, there are 5 balls at the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now, let's think about how many balls Jack has more than Allen. We can see that Jack has 3 balls more than Allen, so Jack has 3 + 2 = 5 balls more than Allen. Therefore, Jack has a total of 5 + 5 = 10 balls at the park.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 艾伦帶了2個氣球，杰克帶了多少個氣球？可以通過跟蹤艾伦帶的氣球來計算。因此，杰克帶了3-2=1個氣球去公園。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克帶了6個氣球，而艾伦帶了多少個氣球。如果杰克帶的氣球比艾伦帶的氣球多4個， значи means that the number of balls carried by Jack is greater than the number of balls carried by Allen by 4. So, if Jack carried 6 balls, then Allen must have carried at least 10 balls (6 - 4 = 10). Therefore, the answer is none.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many balls Jake brought to the park. According to the problem, Jake brought 5 balls to the park. Next, we need to find out how many balls Allan had before he went to the park. According to the problem, Allan had 3 balls. Finally, we need to add up all the balls that both of them have. So, the answer is 8 (5 + 3).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Jack brought 4 balls to the park. Then, Allen bought 3 more balls in the park. So, the total number of balls that Allen has is 3 + 4 = 7 balls. Now, let's compare the number of balls that Allen and Jack have. We can see that Allen has 7 balls and Jack has 4 balls, so Allen has 7 - 4 = 3 more balls than Jack. Therefore, the answer is 3.
 6 + 2 = 8 balls. Therefore, Jack has more balls than Allen.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 艾伦帶了5个气球去公园，杰克帶了4个气球去公园。這意味著艾伦和杰克一起去公园時，他們合共帶了9个气球（5+4=9）。然後，艾伦在公园里又买了3个气球。這意味著艾伦一共帶了12个气球去公园（9+3=12）。因此，艾伦一共帶了12个气球去公园。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Jack brought 2 balls to the park. Then, Allen brought 6 balls to the park. Finally, Jack bought 3 more balls in the park. So, the total number of balls that Allen has is equal to the total number of balls that Jack has plus the number of balls that Allen brought. In other words, Allen has 2 + 6 = 8 balls in total. Therefore, the answer is 8.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，艾伦帶了6个气球，共計6+3=9個气球。然後，杰克又买了4个气球，共計9+4=13個气球。因此，杰克在公园里比艾伦多了4個气球。
 Jack bought 3 more balls at the park, so now he has 11 + 3 = 14 balls in total. Therefore, Jack brought a total of 14 balls to the park.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Allen brought 3 inflatables and 20 balls to the park. Then, we are told that Jack brought 5 inflatables and 59 balls to the park as well. So, in total, there are 3 + 5 = 8 inflatables at the park. However, the question asks us how many inflatables Allen and Jack have together. Since they both brought inflatables, the answer is simply ""none""."
 6 balls. So, together they have 7 + 6 = 13 balls in the park.

 7 + 3 = 10 balls per basket Therefore, there are 640 / 10 = 64 baskets in total.
 Total number of cherries = 110 + 208 = 318 cherries. Therefore, there are 318 cherries in total.
 6 x 16 = 96 red balls / 6 baskets = 16 red balls per basket So, there are 16 red balls in each basket. Therefore, the total number of red balls is 16 x 6 = 96 red balls.
 2 x 7 = 14 green apples. So, there are a total of 70 + 14 = 84 apples in all the baskets. Since there are no green apples in any of the baskets, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we can observe that there are a total of 7 fruits in the basket. Since each basket has either red or green apples, and there are an equal number of each color, we know that the total number of red apples is also 7. Therefore, the number of baskets containing red apples is also 7/2 = 3 and 1/2. So, there are 3 and 1/2 baskets containing red apples. Now, let's consider the green apples. We know that there are 3 more green apples than red apples, so the number of baskets containing green apples is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 baskets containing green apples. In conclusion, there are 3 and 1/2 baskets containing red apples and 6 baskets containing green apples, for a total of 9 baskets.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, there are two baskets and each basket has some red apples and some green apples. We need to find out how many green apples are in each basket. So, let's assume that the number of green apples in one basket is x. Now, we know that the total number of apples in both baskets is 12, so the sum of the number of red apples in both baskets is 4x + 4(12 - x). Since there are no red apples in the second basket, the value of x must be equal to 8. Therefore, there are 8 green apples in the second basket.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 16 balls in total in the basket. Then, we are told that there are 13 red balls and some green balls in the basket. So, the number of green balls is equal to the number of red balls minus 13. Therefore, the answer is zero (0) green balls.
 285 + 60 = 345 balls.
 10 x (4/10) = 40 baskets. So, there are 40 baskets.
 2 red balls. So, the total number of balls in the basket is 36 + 60 + 2 = 98 balls. Since there are more than 98 red balls in the basket (i.e., 2), we can conclude that there are no green balls that are more than one red ball away from each other. Therefore, the answer is none.

So, the total number of action figures now is 2 + 4 = 6. Next, let's count the number of books again. There are still 10 books on the bookshelf, so the total number of books is 10. Therefore, the number of books that are more than the number of action figures is 10 - 6 = 4.
 9 + 10 = 19 books. Therefore, the answer is 19 books.
 11 x 2 = 22 action figures. So, there are 22 action figures on the bookshelf compared to the 7 initial action figures in Jerry's room.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 動作人物有5個，每個動作人物都可以被放在書架上，所以全共有5個位置可以用來放books。如果加上了9本book，那麼就需要使用其中7個位置（因為最後一個位置已經是動作人物）。因此，在杰瑞的房間里，動作人物和Books的數量相等，也就是5：7。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 第1行是8個動作人物模型，第2行是4個新的動作人物模型，第3行是5個旧的動作人物模型被拿走。因此，總共有8 + 4 = 12個動作人物模型在杰瑞的架子上。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，杰瑞在其房間中有3個動作人物玩具。接著，他加了4個新的動作人物玩具，共計7個動作人物玩具。最後，他拿走了一些旧的動作人物玩具，所以現在他的架子上有6個動作人物玩具。因此，杰瑞拿走了0個動作人物玩具。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰瑞最初的架子上有7个动作人物，然後他添加了一些動作人物，使得現在架子上有8个动作人物。如果他已經移除了10個旧的動作人物，那麼目前架子上的動作人物應該是8-10=6個。因此，杰瑞添加了6個動作人物到架子上。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，杰瑞在書架上放了一些動作人物玩具，然後他又往書架上加了2个動作人物玩具。因此，最初他在書架上放了3个动作人物玩具。接下來，他拿走了7个旧的動作人物玩具，使得現在書架上有10个動作人物玩具。因此，最初他在書架上放了3个动作人物玩具。所以，答案是：沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 第一次提出的動作人物玩具是9個，然後再加了7個，共計16個動作人物玩具。如果他的書架上有10本書，那麼每本書都會被一個動作人物玩具包覆。因此，他的書架上的動作人物玩具和書的比例是16：10=2。所以，他的書架上的動作人物玩具比書多了2個。
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 3 books on Jere's bookshelf initially. Then, he added 2 action figures to the bookshelf later. So, in total, there are 5 items (3 books + 2 action figures) on Jere's bookshelf. Since an action figure is not a book, it is more than a book. Therefore, the answer is ""yes"", there are more than 3 books on Jere's bookshelf."
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Jere has 7 books on his bookshelf initially. Then, he added 2 action figures to the bookshelf later. So, the total number of items on the bookshelf now is 7 + 2 = 9. However, there is no mention of how many books are more than the action figures, so the answer is simply ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 2 birds already sitting on the perch. Then, more birds come to join them. So, in total, there are 6 birds on the perch. Now, we need to find out how many birds flew away to sit on the perch. But the problem doesn't tell us that information, so we can't answer it. Therefore, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are some birds sitting on the fence initially. Let's call this number x. Then, four more birds come to join them, so the total number of birds on the fence now is x + 4. Therefore, the answer is x = 0.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 4 birds and 46 birds on the perch initially. So, in total, there are 50 birds on the perch. Then, 6 more birds come to join them. How many birds are now on the perch? The answer is still 50! Because we didn't increase the number of birds on the perch by 6, we just added 6 new birds to the existing group of 50 birds.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 3 birds and 2 storks on the perch initially. Then, 5 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds and 2 storks on the perch now.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 3 birds and 4 sticks on the fence. Then, 2 more birds come to join them. So, in total, there are 5 birds sitting on the fence. However, we are asked how many more birds than sticks there are. Since there are 5 birds and 4 sticks, there is only 1 bird more than the number of sticks. Therefore, the answer is 1.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 2 birds and 6 sparrows sitting on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 5 birds (including the original 2) and 6 sparrows. Since there are more birds than sparrows, there must be at least one bird sitting on the fence for every sparrow. Therefore, the number of birds sitting on the fence is equal to the number of sparrows, which is 6. Hence, there are no more birds than sparrows sitting on the fence.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 4 birds and 6 crows on the fence initially. Then, 2 more crows come to join them. So, in total, there are 4 + 2 = 6 crows sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 6.

But we were asked how many birds are more than hawks, which is none because both birds and hawks are equally represented. Therefore, the answer is zero.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 4 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more storks come to join them. So, in total, we have 10 birds and 3 storks. Since there are more storks than birds, the number of storks is greater than the number of birds. Therefore, the answer is ""more than""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 6 birds already sitting on the perch. Then, 4 more birds come to join them, making it a total of 10 birds (6 + 4). Finally, 8 more birds arrive, bringing the total number of birds on the perch to 18 (10 + 8). Therefore, there are 18 birds on the perch in total.
 There are no birds sitting on the fence. We will think step by step. The first group of birds has 2 birds, so there are 2X birds in total. Then, 5 groups of birds with 5 birds each join, making a total of 5X birds. Finally, 4 groups of ducks with 4 birds each join, making a total of 4Y birds. Therefore, there are 2X + 5X + 4Y birds sitting on the fence in total. But the number of ducks is Y. So, there are no birds sitting on the fence.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 第1批鸟有3只，共計3X鸟。接下來，新添加了2只鸟，共計3+2=5鸟。接下來，再添加了6只鹳，共計5+6=11鸟。因此，有11只鸟坐在篱笆上。
"

Total number of birds = Number of crows + Number of additional birds
= 5 + 4
= 9

So, there are 9 birds sitting on the fence, including both the crows and the additional birds.

Conclusion
In conclusion, there are 9 birds sitting on the fence, including both the crows and the additional birds. This means that there are more birds than crows sitting on the fence. Great job solving the puzzle!"
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果有6只鹳和2只鸟坐在篱笆上，那麼有6+2=8個物品坐在篱笆上。如果接著有3只鸟來加入他們，那麼就會有8+3=11個物品坐在篱笆上。因此，有更多的鸟坐在篱笆上，所以是沒有鹳比鸟多坐在篱笆上。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 3 birds already sitting on the perch. Then, 6 crows and 2 birds join them. So, in total, there are 9 birds (3 + 6 + 2) sitting on the perch. Since there are more crows than birds, there must be more crows sitting on the perch than birds. Therefore, the answer is none.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 第一章有48页，第二章有11页。如果我們加起來，就是59页（48+11）。因此，第一章比第二章多了59页。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有62个露营者划船，下午有39个露营者划船。如果早上有多少個露营者划船，那么下午就會有多少個露营者划船。因此，沒有任何露营者划船。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有52个露营者去划船，這意味著在早上有52个人可以做其他事情。下午有61个露营者去划船，這意味著在下午有61个人可以做其他事情。如果下午去划船的露营者比早上多了多少人，那麼就是61-52=9。因此，下午去划船的露营者比早上多了9人。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有15人去划船，這意味著在早上時間段中有15人去划船。而下午也有一些人去划船，這意味著在下午時間段中也有一些人去划船。但是問題 не提到了這些人的數量，因此不能直接知道下午有多少人去划船。所以，答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 7 people who go sailing in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of people who go sailing is 7 + 60 = 67. Since there are no people going sailing in the morning, the answer is zero (0).
 There are no campers who have been rowing all three times (morning, afternoon, and evening). Therefore, the total number of campers who have been rowing is 36 + 13 + 49 = 108.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有44个露营者划船，下午有39个露营者划船，晚上有31个露营者划船。如果早上有多少个露营者划船，那么下午和晚上也是多少个露营者划船。因此，早上划船的露营者不能比下午或晚上多少人。所以，答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有53个露营者划船，下午有48个露营者划船，晚上有49个露营者划船。如果早上和下午都有同樣的人數，那麼晚上也會有同樣的人數。因此，早上没有多少个露营者划船。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有33个露营者划船，下午有34个露营者划船，晚上有10个露营者划船。如果在下午和晚上都有露营者划船，那么在晚上就有的露营者是34-10=24個。因此，下午划船的露营者比晚上多了24個人。
 None of the above. We need to think step by step based on the problem. In the morning, there are 13 people sailing, and these people may be different campers. In the afternoon, there are 21 people sailing, and these people may also be different campers. Therefore, how many campers are sailing in total?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有29个露营者划船，66个露营者去远足。这意味着在早上，共有85个露营者（29+66） participate in the activity. In the afternoon, there are 26 campers who go sailing. So, the total number of campers who participated in the activity during the day is 85 + 26 = 111 campers. Therefore, there are more campers who went sailing in the morning than in the afternoon.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 早上有41个露营者划船，4个露营者去远足。这意味着在早上，共有45个露营者参加了划船活动（41+4）。下午有26个露营者划船。因此，總共有71个露营者 participate in the boating activity（45+26）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 下午有多少个露营者划船？ 如果早上有43个露营者划船，那么下午的露营者也是43个。因此，下午没有任何露营者划船。所以，答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，瑞秋从树上摘了4个苹果。這意味著树上現在只剩下3个苹果。然後，問題提到树最初有7个苹果。這意味著树上最初就只剩下4个苹果。因此，树上現在和最初都只剩下3个苹果。所以，树上還剩下3个苹果。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 瑞秋从树上摘了7个熟透的苹果，現在树上还有5个苹果。如果3个是熟透的，那麼 remaining 的 must be unripe . So the number of unripe apples on the tree is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 unripe apples on the tree.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 瑞秋从树上摘了2个熟透的苹果，現在树上还有7个苹果。如果6个是熟透的，其余的是未熟的，那么一開始树上有多少个熟透的苹果？  We can start by using the information that there are 7 fruit on the tree now and 6 of them are ripe. So, the number of ripe fruits is 6. Then, we are asked how many ripe fruits were on the tree initially. Since the problem states that ""one open starts with"", it means that the initial number of ripe fruits was 0. Therefore, there were no ripe fruits on the tree initially."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，瑞秋从树上摘了6个熟透的苹果。這意味著現在树上只剩下2个熟透的苹果。接下來，瑞秋再摘了4个未熟的苹果。這意味著現在树上有4个未熟的苹果。因此，最初树上有8个苹果（6+2）。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 瑞秋从每棵树上摘了8个苹果，這意味著它們原本就有8個苹果。如果現在树上還有9個苹果，這代表著瑞秋之前已經摘取了1個苹果。因此，最初所有树上有7個苹果（8 - 1 = 7）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，瑞秋摘了7个苹果自每棵树。因此，她已經摘到了4棵树中的7 x 4 = 28个苹果。現在树上还剩下29个苹果， значи是瑞秋没有摘到這些苹果。因此，瑞秋总共摘了28 + 0 = 28个苹果。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Ed比Doug多了24颗弹珠，意味著Ed現在有24颗弹珠，而Doug只有27颗弹珠。如果Ed找到了9颗弹珠，那么Ed现在有33颗弹珠（24+9），而Doug只有27颗弹珠。因此，Ed比Doug多了6颗弹珠（33-27）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Ed比Doug多了29颗弹珠，這意味著Ed currently has 29 more marbles than Doug. Then, we are told that Ed lost 17 marbles at the amusement park. So, how many marbles does Ed have now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of marbles Ed lost from the original difference between Ed and Doug. In other words, we need to subtract 17 from 29. Therefore, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Ed比Doug多了19颗弹珠，這意味著Ed現在有多少颗弹珠？  First, let's count the number of marbles that Ed has now. According to the problem, Ed has 27 marbles (19 + 8). So, Ed has 27 marbles in total. Now, let's think about how many marbles Doug had originally. According to the problem, Doug had 37 marbles. Since Ed has more marbles than Doug, we can conclude that Ed must have taken some of Doug's marbles. But how many? Let's see... If Ed has 27 marbles and he took some from Doug, then Doug must have had fewer marbles than Ed initially. How few? Well, if Ed has 27 marbles and he took some from Doug, then Doug must have had at least 27 - 8 = 19 marbles initially. So, Doug had 19 marbles initially, and Ed took some of them.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Ed和Doug都有彈珠，但是Ed失去了21颗彈珠，而Doug没有任何彈珠被取走。因此，Ed目前拥有的彈珠数量大于Doug。但是，問題并不提供Ed的現時彈珠數量，只提到Ed有91颗彈珠。因此，我们无法 directly determine how many more bullets Ed has than Doug.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Ed currently has 17 marbles and lost 20 marbles at the amusement park. So, Ed originally had 37 marbles (17 + 20). Now, Doug has x marbles. Since Ed lost more marbles than he gained, Doug must have gained some of Ed's original marbles. Therefore, the final number of marbles that Doug has is x - 20 = 17.
 (450 - 42) = 408 students. Therefore, there are 408 more students who suggested adding potato dumplings than suggested adding carrots.
  Number of students who suggested adding potato dumplings = Total number of students / Number of students who suggested adding potato dumplings = 968 / 479 = 2.03 times more students than suggested adding carrots Number of students who suggested adding carrots = Total number of students / Number of students who suggested adding carrots = 968 / 489 = 1.95 times more students than suggested adding potato dumplings Therefore, there are approximately 1.95 times more students who suggested adding carrots than those who suggested adding potato dumplings.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many students suggested adding potatoes. According to the problem, 264 students suggested adding carrots, so there are 264 - 288 = 44 students who did not suggest adding potatoes. Therefore, there are 44 students who suggested adding potatoes.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many students suggested adding potato dumplings in the menu. According to the problem, 457 students recommended adding potato dumplings. Now, let's find out how many students suggested adding carrots instead of potato dumplings. If there are 63 more students who suggested adding potato dumplings than those who suggested adding carrots, then the number of students who suggested adding carrots is equal to 457 - 63 = 394. Therefore, there are 394 students who suggested adding carrots in the menu.
 166 - 182 = -16. Therefore, there are 16 fewer students who suggested adding carrots than those who suggested adding potato dumplings.
 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students. So, 826 students participated in the survey.
 x - 97 = 120 Therefore, there are 23 more students who suggested adding tomato than those who suggested adding potato.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find the total number of students who suggested adding a particular food item. For example, there are 144 students who suggested adding potatoes, and 79 students who suggested adding tomatoes. Next, we need to find the ratio of students who suggested each food item to the total number of students. In this case, the ratios would be 144/467 = 0.305 for potatoes and 79/467 = 0.172 for tomatoes. Finally, we can compare these ratios to see which food item is more popular among the students. Based on the given information, it appears that tomatoes are more popular than potatoes among the students, as the ratio of students who suggested adding tomatoes to the total number of students (79/467) is greater than the ratio of students who suggested adding potatoes (144/467). Therefore, there are more students who suggest adding tomatoes than those who suggest adding potatoes.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out the total number of students who suggested adding a particular food item. For example, there are 228 students who suggested adding potatoes, and 337 students who suggested adding carrots. Next, we need to find out the difference between these two numbers. In this case, the difference is 109 (337 - 228). Finally, we can divide the number of students who suggested adding each food item by the total number of students to get the proportion of students who suggested each food item. So, the proportion of students who suggested adding carrots is 109/565 = 0.194, and the proportion of students who suggested adding potatoes is 228/565 = 0.406. Therefore, there are more students who suggested adding carrots than those who suggested adding potatoes.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 450 students in total who suggested adding tofu to the menu. Then, we know that 38 students suggested adding mushrooms to the menu. Finally, we know that none of the remaining students participated in suggesting new food items. Therefore, the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items is equal to 450 - 38 = 412.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  If there are 218 students who suggest adding tofu and mushrooms to the menu, and 351 students who suggest only adding mushrooms, then there must be a total of 569 students (218 + 351) who have made suggestions. Therefore, there are 569 - 351 = 218 students who suggest adding mushrooms only.
 x - 76 = 84 - 76 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 more students who did not suggest adding tomatoes than those who suggested adding it.
" 236 boys x 1 = 236 boys Since there are equal numbers of boys and girls in the school, we can conclude that there are no more girls than boys in the school. Therefore, the answer is ""没有"" (mò yǒu) - There are no more."
1 So, for every one girl in the school, there are 25 boys.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find the total number of students in the school. We are given that there are 485 students in the school. Now, let's find out how many girls are in the school. According to the problem, there are 232 female students. So, the number of boys is equal to the number of females minus the number of girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 485 - 232 = 253.
 697 - 365 = 332 Therefore, there are 332 boys in the school.
 635 + 510 = 1145 boys So, there are 1145 boys in the school.
 281 + 0 = 281 female students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 587 + 281 = 868 students. So, the answer is 868 students.
 x = 358 Female students = 358 So, there are 358 female students in the school.
 484 + 418 = 902 female students. Therefore, there are 902 students in total in the school now.
 902 + 44 = 946 girls So, there are 946 girls in the school now.
 1042 - 410 = 632 female students Therefore, there are 632 more female students than male students in this school.
 682 girls join the school Later, there are 1414 girls + 682 girls = 2096 girls in the school. Therefore, the answer is 2096 girls.
 631 + 496 = 1127 girls (new) and 1124 + 910 = 2034 boys (new). Therefore, there are 2034 boys in the school now.
 308 + 318 + 36 = 652 Therefore, there are 652 students in the school.
 Total number of people in the school = 315 + 309 + 772 = 1496 Therefore, there are 1496 people in the school.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find the total number of students in the school. We are given that there are 402 more girls than boys, so the total number of girls is 739 + 402 = 1141. Now, we can use the fact that the total number of students is equal to the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys to solve for the number of boys. Therefore, the number of boys is 1141 - 402 = 739. So, there are 739 male students in the school.
 x = 117. So, there are 117 boys in the school. Now, we know that the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys, which means that the number of girls is 458 + 117 = 575. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 117 + 575 = 692.
 619 - 362 = 257 female students. So, there are 257 more female students than male students in the school.

 x = $17 + $17 = $34. Therefore, Edward had $34 dollars before spending any money.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Edward spent $16 on books and each book cost him the same amount of money. So, if he spent $16 on 92 books, then the total cost of all the books is $16 x 92 = $1472. Now, we are told that Edward still has $6 left after buying the books. Therefore, the total amount of money Edward had before buying the books is $1472 - $6 = $1466.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Edward spent $6 on two books. So the cost of each book is $6 / 2 = $3 per book. Now we have $12 left after buying the books. So the price of each book must be $12 / 2 = $6 per book. Therefore, the price of each book is $6.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Edward spent $6 on a book and $16 on a pen. So far, he has spent a total of $22. Now we are asked how much money he had left after spending this amount. To find out, we need to subtract the amount he spent from his original amount of money. According to the problem, Edward had $37 originally. So, if he spent $22, he would have $15 left ($37 - $22 = $15). Therefore, the answer is $15.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Edward spent $4 on a book and $3 on a pen. So far, he has spent a total of $7. Now we are told that he has $12 left. To find out how much he spent on the book and pen, we can use the information that he has $12 left after buying them. So, the amount he spent on the book is equal to the amount he has left minus the amount he spent on the pen. In other words, the cost of the book is $12 - $3 = $9. Similarly, the cost of the pen is $12 - $4 = $8. Therefore, Edward spent $9 on the book and $8 on the pen.
" $19 - $24 = -$5 So, Edward spent more money on books than on pens. However, since there is no information about the exact amounts that Edward spent on each item, we cannot determine the exact difference between the two. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Love is a man who spent $17 and then received $10 from his friend. Now he has $7 left. How much money did Love have before he spent any money? There is no answer because we are not given any information about Love's initial amount of money.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Zachary做了44个俯卧撑，David比他多做了58个俯卧撑。如果 Zachary和 David一起做了多少个俯卧撑？  We can start by adding the number of push-ups that Zachary and David did together. So, Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 push-ups, so together they did 44 + 58 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, the answer is 102.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們需要知道扎卡里和大卫在俯卧撑的時間是多少。 因此，我們可以得出：扎卡里做了51个俯卧撑，大卫做了44个俯卧撑。 接下來，我們需要知道扎卡里和大卫在俯卧撑的時間是多少。 因此，我們可以得出：扎卡里比大卫多做了51-44=7个俯卧撑。 因此，扎卡里比大卫多做了7个俯卧撑。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  David did 44 push-ups today in gym class. Zackari did more than David by 9 push-ups. So, Zackari did 53 push-ups (44 + 9).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that David did 51 push-ups today in gym class. And we also know that Zackari did more than David, which means he did 49 push-ups. So the total number of push-ups done by both David and Zackari is 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups. Therefore, the answer is 100.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Zachary做了59个俯卧撑，David做的俯卧撑比Zachary多19个，所以 David做了59 + 19 = 78个俯卧撑。  Now we need to find out how many sit-ups David did. According to the problem, David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary, so he did 44 - 27 = 17 sit-ups. Therefore, David did 78 + 17 = 95 total exercises.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Zachary做了44个俯卧撑，David做的俯卧撑比Zachary多29个，所以 David做了44 - 29 = 15个俯卧撑。  Now we need to find out how many sit-ups David did. According to the problem, David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary by 13. So David did 15 - 13 = 2 sit-ups. Therefore, David did 2 sit-ups.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Zachary 做了 53 次俯卧撑， David 做了 69 次俯卧撑（比 Zachary 多 17 次），但 David 做了 53 次仰卧起坐（比 Zachary 少 10 次）。因此， Zachary 一共做了 53 + 53 = 106 次俯卧撑和仰卧起坐。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Zachary 做了 35 次俯卧撑， David 做了 93 次俯卧撑（58 + 35 = 93）。因此， Zachary 做的俯卧撑多了 58 次。但是， Zachary 做的仰卧起坐只有 3 次，而 David 做了 84 次仰卧起坐（87 - 3 = 84）。因此， Zachary 做的仰卧起坐多了 81 次。所以， Zachary 做的俯卧撑多了 58 次，仰卧起坐多了 81 次。
 None of the above. We need to think step by step and consider each number carefully. Zachary did 46 times more abdominal crunches than David, which means he did 46 - 38 = 7 more abdominal crunches. Additionally, Zachary did 10 times more sitting-up exercises than David, which means he did 10 - 62 = -52 more sitting-up exercises. Therefore, Zachary's sitting-up exercises are not more than David's abdominal crunches minus how many?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，扎卡里做了19个俯卧撑。其次，大卫比扎卡里多做了39个俯卧撑。最後，約翰比大卫少做了13个俯卧撑。因此，大卫做了36个俯卧撑（39 - 13 = 36）。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's find out how many push-ups David did. According to the problem, David did 39 push-ups more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 15 push-ups, then David did 39 + 15 = 54 push-ups. Next, we need to find out how many push-ups John did. The problem states that John did fewer push-ups than David by 9 push-ups. So, if David did 54 push-ups, then John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups. Finally, we can find out how many push-ups Zachary did compared to John by subtracting their numbers of push-ups. If Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, then Zachary did 15 - 45 = -30 push-ups less than John. Therefore, Zachary did 30 more push-ups than John.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，大卫比扎卡里多做了36个俯卧撑，而扎卡里做了58个俯卧撑。这意味著扎卡里做了22个更多的俯卧撑（58-36=22）。接下來，扎卡里做了33个仰卧起坐，而大卫只做了33个仰卧起坐。因此，扎卡里做了0个仰卧起坐多多少個（33-0=33）。最後，扎卡里做了22+33=55个俯卧撑和仰卧起坐。所以，扎卡里做的俯卧撑比仰卧起坐多多少個？答案是：沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，大卫比扎卡里多做了27个俯卧撑，而扎卡里只做了5个俯卧撑。這意味著扎卡里未能夠完成27-5=22個俯卧撑。接下來，扎卡里做了17个仰卧起坐，而大卫只做了7个仰卧起坐。這意味著扎卡里未能夠完成17-7=10個仰卧起坐。因此，扎卡里的仰卧起坐比大卫的俯卧撑多了10個。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，瑞秋需要完成7页的数学作业。如果她需要完成比阅读作业多4页，那麼她需要完成阅读作业的 pages = 7 - 4 = 3 page。因此，瑞秋需要完成3页的阅读作业。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many pages the math homework is. If it takes her more time than reading homework, then she needs to complete more pages of math homework. So, let's assume that the math homework is 5 pages long. Now, we need to find out how many pages she needs to complete in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of pages of math homework by 1.5, since she needs to spend more time on it than reading homework. Therefore, she needs to complete 7.5 pages (5 x 1.5) in total.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，瑞秋需要完成8页的数学作业。secondly，她需要完成的阅读作业比数學作業多6页，meaning she needs to complete 6 pages more of reading assignment than math homework. So, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 8 + 6 = 14 pages. Therefore, she needs to complete 14 pages of reading assignments.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many pages the math homework is. If it's 10 pages, then the reading assignment is 3 pages more than that, which means it's 10 + 3 = 13 pages long. So, Rachel needs to complete 13 pages of work in total.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think about the math homework. The problem states that Rachel needs to complete 2 pages of math homework. So, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 2 pages. Next, let's consider the reading comprehension assignment. The problem states that Rachel needs to read and answer questions on 3 pages of material. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete for this assignment is also 3 pages. Finally, let's look at the biology assignment. The problem states that Rachel needs to complete 10 pages of work in biology. Hence, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 10 pages. In conclusion, Rachel needs to complete a total of 2 + 3 + 10 = 15 pages of homework.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，瑞秋需要完成9页数学作业，其中每页都是1/9page的部分。 secondly，she needs to complete 2 pages of reading assignment，which means she has to read 2 x 1/9 = 1/4 page of material. Finally, she needs to complete 96 pages of biology assignment，which is equal to 96 / 9 = 10 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages that Su-Ruei needs to complete is 9 + 1/4 + 10 = 15 pages.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Su-Chan has to complete 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. How many pages does she have to do in biology? Let's see... If the math homework is 11 pages and the reading comprehension homework is 2 pages, then the total number of pages Su-Chan needs to finish is 11 + 2 = 13 pages. So, the difference between the math homework and the biology homework is 11 - 3 = 8 pages. Therefore, Su-Chan has to do 8 more pages in biology than in math.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Su-Chan has to complete 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading comprehension homework, and 8 pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages of reading comprehension homework Su-Chan has to do compared to the biology homework, we can divide the number of pages of reading comprehension homework by the number of pages of biology homework. So, if we divide 11 pages of reading comprehension homework by 8 pages of biology homework, we get 1.375 (or approximately 1 page and 4.25 lines). Therefore, Su-Chan's reading comprehension homework is slightly more than one page longer than her biology homework.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Su-Chan needs to complete 9 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading comprehension homework, and 29 pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages of each type of homework she needs to complete, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of types of homework. So, for math homework, we have 9 pages / 3 types = 3 pages per type. For reading comprehension homework, we have 11 pages / 3 types = 3.67 pages per type (round up to 4 pages). And for biology homework, we have 29 pages / 3 types = 9.67 pages per type (round up to 10 pages). Therefore, Su-Chan needs to complete 3 pages of math homework, 4 pages of reading comprehension homework, and 10 pages of biology homework.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Su-Chan needs to complete 8 pages of math homework and 3 pages of biology homework. So, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 8 + 3 = 11 pages.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Su-Chan needs to complete 5 pages of math homework, 10 pages of reading comprehension homework, and 6 pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages of reading comprehension and biology homework she needs to complete, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of subjects. For example, if she has 10 pages of reading comprehension homework, then she needs to complete 10/2 = 5 pages of reading comprehension homework. Similarly, if she has 6 pages of biology homework, then she needs to complete 6/2 = 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, Su-Chan needs to complete 5 + 3 = 8 pages of reading comprehension and biology homework in total.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Su-ri has to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of math homework. So, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 2 + 4 = 6 pages. Therefore, there are 6 pages of math homework.

 Number of emails received in the morning - Number of emails received in the afternoon = 6 - 2 = 4 Therefore, Jack received 4 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
 Difference = 8 - 6 = 2 emails So, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the morning. Let's assume he received 4 emails in the morning. Now, we are asked how many emails he received in the afternoon. Since he did not receive any emails in the afternoon, the answer is zero (0). Therefore, the correct answer is none (沒有).
 9 + 3 + 5 = 17 emails Jack received a total of 17 emails that day.
 5 + 8 = 13 emails. Therefore, the answer is 13 emails.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning, and then he received 5 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received in the day is 4 + 5 = 9 emails. However, the problem states that Jack received 8 emails in the evening. This means that the total number of emails he received in the whole day is 9 + 8 = 17 emails. Therefore, the answer is 17 emails.
 Let's count the number of emails Jack receives during this time period. If Jack receives 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening, then he receives a total of 11 emails during the time period from morning to evening. Therefore, Jack receives a total of 11 emails.
 17 - 7 = 10. So, Jack received 10 more emails in the evening than in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is 0.
 7 emails - 9 emails = 8 emails So, Jack received 8 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning.
 10 + 5 + 4 = 19 emails. Therefore, there are no more emails received in the evening than in the afternoon.
 Number of emails per minute = Number of emails per hour x 60  Number of emails per minute = 0.417 x 60 = 25.8 (approximately) Therefore, Jack received approximately 25.8 emails during the afternoon.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Jack sent. According to the problem, Jack sent 2 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 10 emails. So, the answer is 10.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克在早上收到了7封邮件，这意味着他在下午没有收到任何邮件。因此，他下午 Received 的邮件数量为0。
 Number of emails in the morning - Number of emails in the evening = 5 - 3 = 2 Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than he did in the evening.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 下午收到了3封電子邮件，早上收到了6封，晚上还收到了一些。这意味着在下午和晚上都 Received some emails。 So the total number of emails Jack received that day is 3 + 6 = 9 emails.

 老鼠跳了47英尺 - 20英尺 = 27英尺。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that the frog jumped 21 inches and the toad jumped farther than the frog by 25 inches. So, the toad jumped 46 inches (21 + 25). Now, we also know that the rat jumped less than the frog by 16 inches. Therefore, the toad jumped more than the rat by 62 inches (46 - 16).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道蚱蜂跳了17英寸，而青蛙跳了39英寸。如果我們想要知道青蛙跳得多少英寸，就需要知道它们之間的差異。因此，我們可以將2者的跳跃 distance 相加：（39英寸 - 17英寸） = 22英寸。所以，青蛙跳得22英寸更遠。
" 跳了Y 英寸 = Y × 12 = 15.6 英尺

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake that requires 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She has already added 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add to make the sugar content higher than the flour content?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake that requires 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. She has already added 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add? We can start by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required. So, the remaining amount of flour needed is 9 - 4 = 5 cups. Now, we need to find out how much sugar is left to be added after subtracting the amount of flour from the total amount of sugar required. So, the remaining amount of sugar needed is 11 - 5 = 6 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
"

1. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour.
2. Mary has already added some flour to the mixture. (We don't know how much yet.)
3. To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed. So, if she needs 6 cups of flour and she has already added x cups, then she needs 6 - x cups of flour.
4. Since the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour (6 - 13 = -7).

So, Mary needs 7 cups of flour more than the original amount required in the recipe."
" 11 - x = remaining cups of flour So, if Mary has used x cups of flour already, then she has (11 - x) cups of flour left. Since there is no value provided for x, we cannot determine the exact number of cups of flour Mary has left. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."
  First, we know that the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar.  Second, we know that Mary has already added 3 cups of powdered sugar. So, if she needs to add another 6 cups of powdered sugar, that means she still needs to add 9 cups (11 - 3 = 9). Therefore, Mary will need a total of 9 cups of powdered sugar to make the cake according to the recipe.
 x = 12 / y. Solving for y, we get y = 9 cups. Therefore, Mary put 9 cups of flour in the bowl.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary needs to add more flour than sugar and salt combined. So, she needs to add at least 3 more cups of flour (since there are 3 cups of sugar and salt). However, the recipe only requires a total of 10 cups of flour, so Mary doesn't need to add any more flour. Therefore, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the mixture, so she needs to add an additional 10 cups (12 - 2 = 10) more flour to have enough salt compared to the flour.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 玛丽 currently has 5 cups of flour and needs to add more sugar than salt. The recipe requires 3 times as much sugar as salt. So, if she adds 2 cups of sugar, she will need to add 1 cup of salt. Therefore, the answer is 1 cup.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake that requires 12 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She has already added 2 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add? We can start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps. Let's see... if she needs 12 cups of flour and she has already added 2 cups of sugar, then she still needs 10 cups of flour (12 - 2 = 10). Now, let's find out how much sugar she needs to add to make up for the 10 cups of flour she used. If she uses 1 cup of sugar per 4 cups of flour, then she will use 2.5 cups of sugar (10 / 4 = 2.5). So, Mary needs to add an additional 2.5 cups of sugar to the recipe.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake that requires 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She has already added 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add compared to the amount of sugar she has added?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake that requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She has already added 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add to make the sugar content higher than the flour content?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 玛丽需要加入5板糖，而她已經加入了11板面粉。這意味著她需要加入4板糖（5 - 11）。
 x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5. Simplifying the equation, we get x = 5. So, Mary has added 5 cups of flour so far.
 2x = 12 This means that Mary put half of the total amount of flour needed in the bowl. Therefore, the answer is 6 cups.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake and the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add? We can start by subtracting the amount she has already added from the total amount required. So, we need to find out how much is left to be added. Let's do that!
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake and the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar. How much more sugar does she need to add? Let's think step by step. First, we can see that Mary has added 3 cups of flour more than what the recipe required (12 - 9 = 3). So, if she adds 3 cups of flour, she will have 15 cups of flour in total (12 + 3 = 15). Now, let's find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add. We know that the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar, so Mary needs to add 6 cups of sugar (11 - 10 = 6) since she has already added 10 cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 6 cups of sugar.
 38 - 6 = 32 cups Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 32 cups of flour to the recipe.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 玛丽需要加入多少杯面粉，因為她已經加入了4杯面粉。如果她想要比糖多，那么她需要加入的面粉數量等於糖的數量除以4。

糖的數量是9杯，所以玛丽需要加入的面粉數量是：

9杯 - 4杯 = 5杯

因此，玛丽需要加入5杯面粉。"
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake that requires 9 cups of sugar, 7 cups of flour, and 4 cups of salt. She has already added 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add to have the same amount of salt?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 玛丽需要加入多少板糖，因為她已經放了12板面粉。如果她需要加入11板糖，那麼她就需要加入1板糖多。如果她需要加入9板糖，那麼她就需要加入2板糖多。因此，玛丽需要加入0板糖或2板糖。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Mary is baking a cake and the recipe requires 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She has already added 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add? We can start by breaking down the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how much sugar Mary has already added. 4 cups. Now, we need to find out how much more sugar she needs to add. To do this, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required. 7 - 4 = 3. So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar.
 12 - 10 = 2 cups of flour. So, Mary needs to add an additional 2 cups of flour to the batter.
 x - 129 = -69. So, there are 69 fewer bird families staying in the mountain area during winter compared to summer.
 49 / 7 = 6.8 birds per bird family. So, on average, 6.8 birds from each bird family remained in the mountain after they flew away for winter.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 20 bird families that fly away for winter. We also know that 14 of these families stay in the mountain area. So, the number of bird families that stay in the mountain area is 14/20 = 0.7. Therefore, there are no bird families that stay in the mountain area.
 85 - 23 = 62 bird families. Therefore, there are 62 bird families living in the mountains after some birds migrated to Africa and Asia.
 73 - 31 = 42 more bird families flew to Africa than to Asia. Therefore, there are 42 more bird families that flew to Africa than to Asia.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 38 bird families in the mountainous area near the equator. Then, we are told that 47 bird families fly to Africa and 94 bird families fly to Asia. So, the total number of bird families flying to Asia is 94 - 47 = 47. Therefore, the number of bird families flying to Africa is equal to the number of bird families flying to Asia, which is 47.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many bird families are in the mountain area. According to the problem, there are 18 bird family groups in the mountain area. Next, we need to find out where each of these bird families will go during winter. The problem states that 38 bird family groups will fly to Africa and 80 bird family groups will fly to Asia. Finally, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families in the mountain area to find out how many bird families stayed behind. So, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many bird families are currently living in the mountain area. According to the problem, there are 87 bird families living there now. Next, we need to calculate the number of new bird families that will join them if 18 more families arrive. Finally, we need to add these two numbers together to get the total number of bird families living in the mountain area after the arrival of the new families. So, the answer is 87 + 18 = 105 bird families.
 49 - 59 + 24 = 0. Therefore, there are no bird families left living in the mountains after all the birds have flown away or moved in.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 27 bird families that have migrated to warmer countries from the mountain area. So, the total number of bird families in the mountain area is 27 - 41 = -14 bird families. Therefore, there are no bird families left in the mountain area.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 86 bird families that fly away to warmer countries during winter. Then, we are asked how many of these birds come from the initial 45 bird families in the nearby mountain. To find out, we need to divide the total number of birds flying away by the number of birds initially present in the mountain. So, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 41 bird families in the mountainous area near us. Then, we are told that 35 of these bird families fly to Asia and 62 fly to Africa. So, the number of bird families that fly to Africa is greater than the number that fly to Asia by how many? We can conclude that the difference between the two numbers is 62 - 35 = 27. Therefore, there are 27 more bird families that fly to Africa than to Asia.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 3 bird species living near the mountain. Then, new birds from the North Pole arrive and join them, making a total of 26 bird species in the area. Next, two bird species fly south for the winter, leaving only 24 bird species left in the area. Therefore, there are 24 bird species living near the mountain after the migration.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗在接到盒子时有253支蜡笔，到學年末他已經丟失或贈送了70支，餘下的是283支（253 - 70）。然後，我們知道保罗在學年末時還有多少支蜡笔，因此答案是 zero (0)。
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗在生日時得到了一盒蜡笔，共有 x 支蜡笔。他在學年結束前丢失或送出了 y 支蜡笔，因此現在他手中剩下 z 支蜡笔。

x = 1 + (y / 2) = 1 + (551 / 2) = 1 + 275.5 = 496.5
z = x - y = 496.5 - 551 = -54.5

因此，保罗在生日時得到了 496.5 支蜡笔。"
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，保罗接著111支蜡笔，共計111+111=222支蜡笔。然後，他丟失了106支蜡笔，共計222-106=116支蜡笔。因此，保罗現在掌握的蜡笔數量是116支。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，保罗得到了65支蜡笔。然後，他向朋友分配了213支蜡笔。最后，他丢失了16支蜡笔。因此，保罗现在拥有的蜡笔数量是：65 + (213 - 16) = 244 支。所以，保罗没有丢失或送出任何蜡笔。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，保罗得到了589支蜡笔。然後，他把571支蜡笔送给了朋友。這意味著保罩現在殘存的蜡笔是589 - 571 = 18支。最後，他丟失了161支蜡笔。因此，保罩现在殘存的蜡笔是18 + (-161) = -143支。所以，保罩的朋友 получи的蜡笔数量大于保罩本人丢失的蜡笔数量。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，保罗得到了一盒110支蜡笔。其次，他给了90支蜡笔给他的朋友。最後，他丟失了412支蜡笔。因此，保罗丟失的蜡笔数量是：412 - (110 + 90) = 212。所以，保罗丟失的蜡笔数量为212支。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗有563个蜡笔，然後他送了558个蜡笔给朋友，那么他现在还有563-558=75个蜡笔。最后，他丢失了558个蜡笔，所以他現在只剩下332个蜡笔。
 None
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗在接到盒子時有521支蜡笔和66个橡皮擦。如果他不會丟失或送出任何物品，那么最後他剩下的蜡笔應该是521 x (1 - 0.15) = 439支。因此，保罗丢失或送出了154支蜡笔。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗在开始时接到了531支蜡笔和38个橡皮擦。如果他不会丢失任何一个物品，那么最後他剩下的蜡笔和橡皮擦应该是：531 + 38 = 569。因此，保罗剩下的蜡笔比橡皮擦多了32支（569 - 391 = 178）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗接著得到了601支蜡笔和406个橡皮擦。如果他在學年末時只剩下336个橡皮擦， значи means that he must have had 336 - 406 = 70 more rubber erasers than pencils at the beginning. So, there are 70 more rubber erasers than pencils.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗在生日時得到了一盒蜡笔，共有300支。到學年末，他只剩下291支，意味著他在生日時已經接收了9支蜡笔（300 - 291 = 9）。因此，保罗在生日時得到了9支蜡笔。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，保罗接著267支蜡笔，然後丟失了231支，最後送給了朋友308支。因此，保罗现在拥有的蜡笔数量是：267 - 231 + 308 = 96。所以，保罗给朋友的蜡笔数量比他丢失的蜡笔多了96支。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗在接觸到盒子時，他已經有457个橡皮擦和320支蜡笔。如果他在學年末只剩下523个橡皮擦， значи means that he must have lost some of the rubber wipes during the year. However, we are told that he did not lose any of them, so the only possible explanation is that he used some of the pencils to replace the ones he used as erasers for the rubber wipes. Therefore, there were 320 - 52 = 268 pencils left at the end of the year.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many customers the server has in total. From the problem statement, we know that there are 11 customers initially. Then, we need to find out how many customers leave after some time. The problem statement tells us that there are 3 customers left behind. So, the number of customers who left is equal to the number of customers left behind minus the initial number of customers. In this case, the number of customers who left is 3 - 11 = -8. Therefore, the answer is zero.
 1 customer is still there. So, the difference between the number of customers who have left and the number of customers who are still there is 2 (3 - 1).
 At first, the server has 9 customers. After 9 customers leave, he still has 12 customers, so the number of customers at the beginning was 9.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many customers the server has initially. According to the problem, there are 14 customers in total. Now, let's think about how many customers have left. The problem states that 5 customers have left, so we need to subtract 5 from 14 to get the remaining number of customers. Therefore, the answer is 9.
 15 - 4 = 11 customers. Therefore, 4 customers have left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, let's count the number of customers the server has initially. There are 12 customers in total. Now, we need to find out how many customers leave. The question says that 15 customers leave. So, the number of customers left is 15 - 12 = 3. Finally, we add the new customers to find out the current number of customers. There are 14 new customers, so the total number of customers now is 3 + 14 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 customers remaining.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 3 customers initially. Then, more people come and the server has 8 customers in total. So, the number of new customers is 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, 5 new customers came to the restaurant.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果一个服务员有8个客人，那么在一些客人离開後，他就剩下7个客人（8 - 1 = 7）。接着，他又得到了99个新客人， Totally 99 new customers! So, the number of customers he has now is 7 + 99 = 106 customers. Therefore, no customer left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, there are 12 customers initially. Then, some of them leave and he has 14 customers left. Finally, he gets 10 new customers, so the total number of customers now is... (wait for it) ...12 + 14 - 10 = 22 customers!
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果丹买了一块价值2美元的糖果，那麼他現在拿到了2美元的糖果。如果他现在还剩下3美元， значи是他原来拿到的钱是3美元。因此，他最初有3美元的钱。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果丹有4美元，他可以用來買到的東西是多少？ 如果他买了一块糖果，那麼他現在 left with 3美元。 因此，糖果的价格是4美元 / 3美元 = 1.33美元。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果丹有4美元，他买了99个糖果棒，每个糖果棒花了3美元，那么總共花了3 x 99 = 297美元。因此，丹現在拿到的錢是4 - 297 = -293美元。所以答案是沒有錢。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果丹有3美元，他可以買到3個糖果棒。如果每個糖果棒的价格都一样，那麼丹可以用3美元買到3個糖果棒。因此，每個糖果棒的价格是0美元。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果丹有2美元，可以买到多少个糖果棒？  First, let's think step by step. If Dan has $2, he can buy how many candy bars? We need to divide the amount of money he has by the cost of each candy bar. $2 / $3 = x candy bars Where x is the number of candy bars Dan can buy with his $2. So, Dan can buy 2 candy bars.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹有7美元，他买了一块价值2美元的糖果，那么他現在 left with 5美元（7 - 2 = 5）。接下來，他买了一块价值3美元的巧克力，那么他现在 left with 2美元（5 - 3 = 2）。因此，丹currently has 2美元。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How much did Dan pay for the chocolate? He paid $6 for the chocolate. Now, how much does he have left after buying the chocolate? He has $4 left. So, the answer is $0.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that the total cost of the candy is $6, and the cost of the chocolate is $3. So, the total amount of money Dan spent is $6 + $3 = $9. Therefore, Dan spent more money on the candy than he did on the chocolate.
1, or equal amounts. Therefore, Dan spent an equal amount on both candy and chocolate.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹有4美元，他买了一块价值8美元的糖果，餘額是4-8=4美元。接著，他的朋友给了他5美元，餘額現在是4+5=9美元。因此，丹现在把4美元和5美元都可以用來購買糖果。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道丹买了一块糖果，然後丹余下3美元。這意味著丹在購買糖果時花費了3美元。因此，糖果的价格是3美元。
 3美元 x 10个 = 30美元 So, he has 4 - 30 = 1美元 left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果丹有3美元，那麼他可以買到最多的糖果是3個。如果他買了2個糖果，那麼他餘下的錢是1美元。因此，每個糖果的价格是1美元。
 $7 - $3 = $4. Therefore, he spent $4 more on the candy bar than on the chocolate.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How much did he spend on chocolate? He spent $7 on chocolate. Now, how much did he spend on candy? He spent $2 on candy. So, the total amount of money he spent is $7 + $2 = $9. Therefore, he spent more money on chocolate than on candy.
 115 - 78 = 37 books. So, he has 37 books left.
 105 - 137 = 32. Therefore, Paul initially had 32 books.
 x - 35 = 62 Therefore, the answer is zero.
 x = 3 So, Paul bought 3 books.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paul originally had 2 books. He sold some of them in a car sale activity and bought 150 new ones. Now he has 58 books left. So the number of books he sold is equal to the number of new books he bought minus the number of original books he had. In this case, it's 150 - 2 = 148 books. Therefore, he sold 148 books.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paul has 21 books and sells some of them in a car park. After that, he buys 42 new books. Now he has only 15 books left. To find out how many books he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he bought from the original number of books he had. So, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗有71本書，然後卖掉了一些書，現在他有116本書。如果他买了38本新书，那么他最初有的書数量是...? (71 - 38 = 33) 所以，保罗买了的新书数量是33本。
 None (We can't determine the exact number of books sold because we are not given that information.)
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 保罗有51本書和106支笔。如果他將其中的一些笔和書卖掉，那么他剩下的是82本書和14支笔。但是问题并没有提到保罗卖掉了多少支笔。因此，我们不能直接知道保罗卖掉了多少支笔。所以，答案是沒有。
 E) 27 books
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paul has 134 books and gives 39 to his friends. After selling some in the garage sale, he has 68 books left. So, the number of books sold in the garage sale is equal to 68 - 39 = 29 books.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paul has 95 pens and 153 books. If he sold some of the books and pens in a car boot sale, he would have less books and pens left. But the question doesn't tell us how many books or pens he sold. So, we can't find out how many books he sold by looking at the information given in the problem. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."
 42 - x = 19. Solving for x, we get x = 23. Therefore, Paul sold 23 pens in the car park.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Jessica took 8 flowers from her garden and put them in the vase. So, there are now 8 fewer flowers in the garden than before. But we don't know how many flowers were originally in the garden. Therefore, the answer is ""none"" or ""0""."
 x + 16 - 16 = 23 - 16 x = 7 So there were originally 7 roses in the vase.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many flowers Jexica threw away. According to the problem, she threw away 4 flowers. So, the number of flowers in the vase before she threw them away is 2 + 4 = 6. Now, let's find out how many new flowers she picked from her garden and put into the vase. According to the problem, she picked 15 new flowers. So, the total number of flowers in the vase after she picked new ones is 6 + 15 = 21. Therefore, she cut 15 - 6 = 9 new flowers.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Jessica threw away 33 roses and then picked some new ones from the garden to put in the vase. So, there are 17 roses in the vase now. To find out how many more roses she picked than she threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away (33) from the total number of roses in the vase (17). Therefore, she picked 16 more roses than she threw away.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Jessica threw away 34 roses and picked some new ones from the garden to put in the vase. So, there are 15 roses left in the vase now. If she threw away more roses than she picked, then there would be fewer roses in the vase afterward. But since we're told that there are 15 roses left in the vase now, it means that Jessica threw away fewer roses than she picked. Therefore, the number of roses she threw away is less than the number of roses she picked.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Jessica 剪了一些玫瑰，那麼 flower pot 現在有 20 - 7 = 13 朵玫瑰。如果她剪了多少朵瑰，就是 13 - 7 = 6 朵玫瑰。因此，她剪了 6 朵玫瑰。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many roses Jessica picked from her garden. We know that there were originally 12 roses in the garden and she picked some of them. So, the number of roses left in the garden after she picked some is 12 - x, where x is the number of roses she picked. Now, we add the number of roses in the vase (which is 21) to the number of roses left in the garden, which gives us a total of 21 + (12 - x) = 33 roses. Since we are asked how many roses are left in the garden, the answer is 0 roses.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Jessica took some roses and lilies from the garden. Now there are more lilies than roses in the vase. So, Jessica must have taken more lilies than roses. But how many more? We can't just guess! Let's think this through step by step. First, we know that there were originally 15 rosebuds and 62 lily buds in the vase. Then, Jessica took some of them. After she was done, there were 17 rosebuds and 96 lily buds left in the vase. That means Jessica took 3 fewer rosebuds than lily buds (15 - 3 = 12). So, Jessica took 12 lily buds from the vase.
 X + 10 = 21 + X . Solving for X , we get X = 11 . Therefore, Jessica cut 11 flowers of lilies .
 8 roses - 3 lilies = 5 more roses than lilies. Therefore, there are 5 more roses than lilies in the bouquet now.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Jessica cut some roses and lilies from the garden. Now there are 11 rose...
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道Jessica从花园里剪了一些玫瑰花，但不知道具体剪了多少朵。接下來，問題提到花瓶里有19朵玫瑰花，但不知道最初有多少朵玫瑰 flower in the vase。因此，我們無法 directly determine how many roses Jessica cut from the garden. Therefore, the answer is none (沒有).
 14 - 26 = -12 roses. So, Jessica cut -12 roses from the bouquet.
" 3 - x = 3 - y and 16 - y = 13. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x and y. For example, if Jessica cut 2 flowers from the roses, then x = 2; if she cut 4 flowers from the lilies, then y = 4. Therefore, there are 5 lily flowers left in the vase (3 - 4 = 5) and 9 rose flowers left (13 - 2 = 9)."
 21 + 20 = 41 lilies. That means there are 41 lilies and 10 more roses than before. Therefore, the answer is 31 (41 - 10).
 There are 3 more lilies than roses!
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道罗宾的頭髮原本長17英尺。其次，我們知道她剪掉了一些英尺的頭髮。最後，我們知道她的頭髮現在長13英尺。因此，她剪掉了14英尺的頭髮（17英尺 - 13英尺 = 14英尺）。
 x = 10 - 20 = -10 inches. Since negative numbers are not possible for hair lengths, we can conclude that Robbin did not cut any hair off. Therefore, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，罗宾剪掉了11英寸的頭髮，那麼她的頭髮現在長度是16英寸 - 11英寸 = 5英尺。接下來，她又長了12英寸的頭髮，那麼她的頭髮現在長度是5英尺 + 12英寸 = 17英寸。因此，罗宾的頭髮現在長度是17英寸。
 19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道罗宾剪掉了她的頭髮13英寸。secondly，我們知道她的頭髮最初長14英寸。now，let's think about how much longer her hair is now.if she had 14 inches of hair initially and then cut off 13 inches, that means she has 1 inch of hair left.so,her hair is currently 14 - 1 = 13 inches long.therefore,the answer is 13 inches.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，罗宾的頭髮長了8英寸，那麼現在它的頭髮長度是14英寸 + 8英寸 = 22英寸。接下來，她剪掉了20英寸，所以現在她的頭髮長度就是22英寸 - 20英寸 = 2英尺。因此，罗宾的頭髮現在長2英尺。
 Add the original number of bottle caps Dan had to the new number he found. 12 + 53 = 65 So, Dan now has 65 bottle caps.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Dan has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he finds some more in the park. How many bottle caps does he have now? Let's think step by step. First, we know that Dan already had 21 bottle caps in his collection before he went to the park. Then, he found some more in the park. So, let's say he found x number of bottle caps in the park. We are told that the total number of bottle caps Dan has now is 53. This means that the sum of the number of bottle caps he already had and the number he found in the park must equal 53. In other words, 21 + x = 53. Solving for x, we get x = 32. Therefore, Dan found 32 bottle caps in the park.
 114 - 33 = 81 Therefore, Dan initially had 81 bottle caps.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了36个瓶盖，同時扔掉了35个旧的。這意味著丹尼現在收藏中有22個瓶盖。如果他在公园里找到的瓶盖和扔掉的瓶盖都是不同的，那麼丹尼的收藏中的瓶盖數量會增加。但是問題 не提及任何信息表明丹尼在公园里找到的瓶盖和扔掉的瓶盖是相同的。因此，丹尼的收藏中的瓶盖數量并没有增加。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了30个瓶盖，而且扔掉了63个旧的瓶盖。這意味著丹尼現在收藏中有42个瓶盖。如果丹尼扔掉的瓶盖比他在公园里找到的多多少个？那麽就是0！因為丹尼扔掉的瓶盖和他在公园里找到的瓶盖都是0。所以答案是0。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了22个瓶盖和8个包装纸，這些物品都是新的。因此，丹尼最初就已經拿到了這些物品。如果他最初没有任何瓶盖或包装纸，那麼他在公园里找到的22个瓶盖和8个包装纮都是新的，也就是说，他最初只有0个瓶盖和0个包装纸。所以，丹尼最初有 zero 个瓶盖。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了22个瓶盖，這些瓶盖之後被加入了丹尼的收藏中。同時，他也找到了30个包装纸，這些包装纸也被加入了丹尼的收藏中。因此，丹尼最初就已經拿到了30个包装纸。所以，丹尼一開始有30个包装纸。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了30个瓶盖，而在現在的收藏中只有7个瓶盖。這意味著丹尼在公园里找到了30 - 7 = 23個瓶盖。同樣地，丹尼在公园里找到了14個包装纸，而在現在的收藏中有86個包装纮。這意味著丹尼在公园里找到了14 + 86 = 100個包装纸。因此，丹尼在公园里找到了比包装纸多多少个瓶盖：100 - 14 = 86個瓶盖。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了11个瓶盖，這些瓶盖可以被分配给68個瓶盖中，所以他現在的收藏中只有47個瓶盖。同理，他在公园里找到了28個包装纸，這些包装纸可以被分配给51個包装纸中，所以他現在的收藏中只有23個包装纸。因此，丹尼在公园里找到了23個比瓶盖多的包装纸。
 None   We can see that Dan found 43 bottle caps and 8 packaging papers in the park. Therefore, he has more bottle caps than packaging papers.
 None (he has the same number of boxes as bottle caps)
 41 (66 - 25). Therefore, Dan initially had 41 bottle caps.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道丹尼原本已經有25個瓶盖。然後，我們知道他在公园里找到了32個瓶盖。因此，丹尼最終有多少個瓶盖？ 解： 25 + 32 = 57 所以丹尼最終有57個瓶盖。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里扔掉了60个旧的瓶盖，這意味著他原本就有60個瓶盖。而他在公园里找到了58個新的瓶盖，這意味著他現在有67個瓶盖。因此，丹尼一開始就有60個瓶盖。
 none
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼把54個旧的瓶盖扔掉，這意味著他現在只有52個瓶盖。如果他在公园里找到了48個新的瓶盖，那麼他的總共有52+48=100個瓶盖。因此，丹尼扔掉的瓶盖和他在公园里找到的相等。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了82个包装纸和29个瓶盖，這意味著他最初已經有了42个瓶盖。因此，丹尼一開始就有42个瓶盖。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了66个包装纸和39个瓶盖。如果他一開始没有任何包装纸，那么他在公园里找到的包装纸数量是66。而且，他在公园里找到的瓶盖数量是39。因此，丹尼一開始有0个包装纸。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了46个包装纸和50个瓶盖。如果他在公园里找到的瓶盖比包装纸多多少个，那么他的收藏中的瓶盖数量应该是...? (46-50) = -4 因为丹尼在公园里找到的瓶盖多于包装纸，所以他的收藏中的瓶盖数量应该是-4。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了65个包装纸，其中5个是瓶盖。這意味著丹尼在公园里找到了60个不同的包装纸（65-5=60）。現在丹尼的收藏中有31个瓶盖和9个包装纸，這意味著丹尼在公园里找到了32个包装纸（31+9=40）。因此，丹尼在公园里找到了40个包装纸多于瓶盖的包装纸。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了58个瓶盖和25个包装纸，這些物品都是丹尼收集的。現在，丹尼的收藏中有11个包装纸和12个瓶盖。如果丹尼原本没有任何包装纸或瓶盖，那麼，他 current collection 中的包装纸和瓶盖應该有多少？ 我們可以通過分析丹尼 original collection 中的包装纸和瓶盖数量，並且跟目前的收藏中的数量進行比較，就能得出答案。  Based on the information given in the problem, Dan collected a total of 58 bottle caps and 25 pieces of wrapping paper in the park. He currently has 11 pieces of wrapping paper and 12 bottle caps in his collection. If he had no wrapping paper or bottle caps to start with, then how many bottle caps does he have now? We can analyze the number of wrapping papers and bottle caps in his original collection and compare it to the number in his current collection to find the answer.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 丹尼在公园里找到了15个瓶盖和18个包装纸，這些物品都是不同的。因此，丹尼現在有67个包装纸和35个瓶盖。如果我們計算每個物品的數量，就會發現：67（包装纸） - 35（瓶盖） = 32。所以，丹尼 currently has 32 more pieces of packaging than bottle caps.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克有11个桃子，而史蒂文只有10个桃子。因此，史蒂文有11-10=1个桃子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克比史蒂文少7个桃子，那么杰克有7个桃子。如果杰克有7个桃子，那么他的總數就是7+15=22。因此，杰克有22个桃子。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克比史蒂文少7个桃子，那么杰克有多少个桃子？ 7-桃子 X 2 = 14桃子。因此，吉尔有14个桃子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道杰克比史蒂文少9个桃子。因此，杰克有9個桃子。接下來，我們知道史蒂文有16個桃子。因此，史蒂文有7個桃子 mehr als Jack（Jack has 9 balls, and Steve has 16 balls, so Steve has 7 more balls than Jack）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，杰克比史蒂文少6个桃子，這意味著杰克有6個桃子。而史蒂文有18個桃子，這意味著他有12個桃子。因此，吉尔有5個桃子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克比史蒂文少5个桃子，意味著杰克有45个桃子（45-5=39）。而史蒂文有18个桃子。因此，杰克比吉尔多27个桃子（39-18=21）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，杰克比史蒂文少16个桃子，意味著杰克只有16個桃子。接下來，史蒂文比吉尔多15个桃子，意味著史蒂文有15個桃子。最後，如果吉尔有12個桃子，那么吉尔比杰克和史蒂文都多了幾個桃子。因此，吉尔比杰克和史蒂文多了13個桃子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克比史蒂文多79个苹果，意味著杰克有多少个苹果。如果杰克有x个苹果，那么他就有79-x个苹果。而杰克也比史蒂文多12个桃子，意味著杰克有多少个桃子。如果杰克有y个桃子，那么他就有12+y个桃子。因此，我們可以設置下面的方程：79 - x = 12 + y。解ving this equation, we get x = 61 and y = 38. Therefore, Jack has 61 apples and 38 peaches.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克比史蒂文多3个苹果，意味著杰克有3個蘋果。因此，杰克有3個蘋果。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道杰克比史蒂文有6个桃子，而史蒂文有17个桃子。這意味著杰克比史蒂文多了9個桃子（17-6=9）。接下來，我們知道杰克比史蒂文有8個苹果，而史蒂文有16個苹果。這意味著杰克比史蒂文多了8個苹果（16-8=8）。因此，杰克比史蒂文多了9+8=17個 fruit。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 杰克比史蒂文少3个桃子，多10个苹果。如果杰克有3個桃子，那么他的總桃子數量是3。如果杰克有10個苹果，那么他的總蘋果數量是10 + 3 = 13。因此，杰克比史蒂文多了13個苹果。
0 = 67...(4)This means that there are no possible values of x and y that satisfy the equation.Therefore, Jack does not have any balls.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道：History has 18 apples.Jack is less than History by 12 apples, so Jack has 6 apples.Now we need to find out how many apples Gil has.We know that History is greater than Gil by 8 apples, so if History has x apples, then Gil has x - 8 apples.So the number of apples Gil has is...
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道：杰克比史蒂文少12个桃子。這意味著杰克有19 - 12 = 7个桃子。然後，我們知道：杰克比吉尔多72个桃子。這意味著杰克有7 + 72 = 85个桃子。因此，杰克有85个桃子。
"

X = 10

So Jake has 10 apples, and Gil has 7 apples."
 Jack has 9 cherries. Therefore, Jack has 9 cherries.
 Jack has 8 + x = 20 fruits (cherries + apples) Since Steve has 12 cherries, he must have x - 13 = 9 fruits (cherries only). Therefore, Jack has 20 - 9 = 11 fruits.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  History Jack has 8 apples and Steve has 11 apples and 18 pears. How many more pears does Steve have than Jack? There is no answer because the information given in the problem does not allow us to determine how many more pears Steve has than Jack.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 奧利維亞的錢包里有78美元，超market花了15美元，餘額是...?  Hmm... let's see... if Oliva has $78 in her purse and she spends $15 at the supermarket, then she has... $63 left! That's right!
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設奧利維亞在超市花了78美元，那麼她現在剩下的錢是33美元。如果她最初有錢， значи means she had money left after buying the groceries. So, her initial amount of money is equal to $33 - $78 = -$45 . Since it's a negative number, that means she didn't have any money initially. Therefore, the answer is none ($0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設奧利維亞在ATM機上提取了148美元，那麼她現在的錢包中就只剩下100美元。接著，她去超市後再次提取了159美元，這時候她的錢包中就是100+159=259美元。因此，她花了0美元。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設奧利維亞在ATM機上取了x美元。因為她已經有3美元，所以她需要取得的錢是x-3美元。她到 supermarket 後，剩下的錢是49美元 - (x-3)美元 = x美元。這意味著她从 ATM machine 上取的錢和她在supermarket 花費的錢相等。因此，她从ATM machine 上取的錢不會多於或者小於她在supermarket 花費的錢。所以，答案是沒有。
 $ 144 - x = 14 $ x = $ 126 Therefore, Olivia spent $ 126 at the supermarket.
 x = 57  So, Olivia spent $57 at the supermarket.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設奧利維亞在超商中購物了$100的商品，剩下的餘額是$54。如果她花了$29，那麽她的餘額就是$25（$54-$29）。因此，奧利維亞在超商中花了$29。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，奧利維亞花了38美元。這38美元是她的錢包中的一部分，因此她現在 left with less money than before。secondly，奧利維亞 initial amount of money was $128。if she spent $38, then she has $90 left. therefore, the answer is $90.
 19 - 5 = 14 Now, let's check if our answer is correct. Yes, it is! There are only 14 applications left on David's phone after he deleted 5 of them.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果戴夫手机上有18个应用，然後他 Delete 了18个应用，那麼手機上現在有幾個应用？ 答案是：5個。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果戴夫有10个应用程式，然後添加了11个新的应用程式，那麼現在戴夫有的应用程式是10+11=21個。接著，他將某些应用程式 deleted，所以现在戴夫只有4個应用程式。因此，他Delete了27個应用程式（21-4）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，戴夫手机上有21个应用程序。其次，他添加了89个新应用程序。最後，他还剩下24个应用程序。要知道，他添加了多少个应用程序比他删除的多，我们需要知道他 deleted 的应用程序的数量。但是，问题并没有提供这个信息。因此，我 cannot answer this question.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果戴夫在手机上添加了71个新应用程序，那么现在他的手机上应该有71+15=86个应用程序。如果他还是delete了一些应用程序，那么现在他的手机上只有14个应用程序。因此，他 delete 的应用程式多于 add 的应用程式。
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. Then, he deleted some applications and files, but the number of remaining applications is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine how many applications David deleted. So, the answer is ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 17 applications and 21 files on his phone initially. Then, he deleted some applications and files, but the number of remaining applications and files is not equal to the total initial number. So, we can conclude that David deleted at least 4 applications and 8 files. However, the question does not specify how many applications or files were actually deleted, so we cannot give an exact answer.
 Number of remaining apps = 21 / 4 = 5.5 (round down to nearest whole number) So, David has 5 more applications than files on his mobile phone.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially. Then, he deleted some applications and files, but the number of remaining applications is not specified. However, we are told that there are 6 remaining applications after deleting some. Therefore, the total number of applications David had on his phone before deleting any was 19 + 6 = 25. Similarly, the total number of files he had was 18 + (number of files remaining after deleting some), which is also not specified. Since we don't have enough information to determine the number of files remaining after deleting some, we cannot find out how many more files than applications David has on his phone. So, the answer is none.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 17 applications on his phone initially. Then, he added some more applications, but the number of applications he added is not specified in the problem. Therefore, we cannot determine how many additional applications David added. So, the answer is ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 59 files on his phone and after deleting some applications and files, he is left with 12 applications and 30 files. To find out how many applications David deleted, we can divide the number of remaining applications by the total number of applications he had initially. So, 12 / 59 = 0.20 (or 20%) . Therefore, David deleted 20% of his initial applications. Now, let's move on to finding out how many files David deleted. We know that David has 30 files left after deleting some applications and files. To find out how many files David deleted, we can divide the number of remaining files by the total number of files he had initially. So, 30 / 59 = 0.51 (or 51%) . Therefore, David deleted 51% of his initial files.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 24 files on his phone before deleting some applications and files. Then, after deleting the applications and files, he is left with 17 applications and 21 files. So, the number of files he deleted is 24 - 17 = 7. Is that correct?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 24 applications and 9 files on his mobile phone initially. Then, he deleted some applications and files, but the number of remaining applications is not specified. We can assume that the number of remaining applications is less than or equal to 24, since we are told that there were more applications than files left on the phone after deletion. Therefore, the number of remaining applications is between 0 and 24, inclusive. Since there are only 12 applications left on the phone, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that David has 11 applications and 3 files on his phone initially. Then, he deleted some applications and files, but the number of remaining files is not specified. Therefore, we can assume that the number of remaining files is equal to or greater than 11. Since there are only 2 remaining applications, the total number of files must be at least 2 x 11 = 22. So, the answer is 22.
 242 - 136 = 106 Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell 收集棒球卡的時候，她把301张卡片给了Jeff。這意味著 Nell 原本有301张卡片。如果 Jeff 現在 still have 154张卡片， значи是 Nell 最初有的卡片數量大于或等於154張。因此，Nell 最初有的卡片數量是不同於154的整數值。所以，答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell collects baseball cards. She has 528 cards and Jeff only has 11 cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, now she has 252 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell 有 566 張卡，然後將其中一些給 Jeff，現在 Nell 仍有 535 張卡。如果 Jeff 有的是 Nell 給他的卡片，那麼 Jeff 就有 Nell 給他的卡片的數量。但是問題 не提到了這個數量，因此答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell 有 309 張棒球卡和 356 張 10 卡，共計 465 張卡片。 Nell 已經 gave some cards to Jeff，所以 Nell 現在 still has 415 張棒球卡和 149 張 10 卡。 So, the number of baseball cards Nell has is 415 - 309 = 106 张， and the number of 10-card she has is 149 - 356 = -207 张。 Therefore, Nell has more than 100 baseball cards but less than 207 10-cards.
 404 - 495 = -91. Since Nell has fewer than 10-card packs than baseball cards, there must be at least 91 baseball cards in addition to the 10-card packs. Therefore, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell 已經 gave John 195 cards, so she has 573 - 195 = 378 cards left. Then, she gave some cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the number of cards she has left minus the number of cards she gave to John. In this case, that would be 378 - 195 = 183 cards. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 183 cards.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell 有 438 張棒球卡，其中 18 張是 10 卡。如果 Nell 已經分配了一些卡片給 Jeff，那麼剩下的棒球卡就是 410 張（438 - 26 = 410）。而 Nell 也有 18 張 10 卡。因此，Nell 比 10 卡多少张棒球卡？ Nell 比 10 卡 59 张多（410 - 18 = 402）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Nell 有 239 張棒球卡，其中一些卡片 Give to Jeff，現在她 still have 111 張棒球卡。 So, the number of baseball cards that Nell has left is 111 - 239 = -128。 But there are no negative numbers in a deck of cards! Therefore, Nell must have 128 張棒球卡。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果帕科有28块饼干，他吃了一些，那麽剩下的餘額是多少？ 可以用28-X表示剩下的餘額，其中X是帕科吃了多少块饼干。 現在我們要知道帕科吃了多少块饼干。 因此，我們可以使用公式： X = 28 - (帕科吃了多少块饼干)。 现在我們需要解釋問題中的“帕科吃了多少块饼干”。 可以看到，問題中没有提供任何信息或数据来确定帕科吃了多少块饼干。 因此，我们不能回答这个问题。 综上所述，我们无法回答这个问题，因为它没有提供足够的信息或数据来计算帕科吃了多少块饼干。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果帕科有40块饼干，他吃了其中的2块，那么剩下的餘額是40-2=38块饼干。接著，他又买了37块饼干，這意味著他現在拥有的饼干是38+37=75块。因此，帕科現在拥有的饼干是75块。
 None (he ate less than he bought)
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果帕科有13块饼干，他吃了其中的2块，那么現在他 left 的餘下饼干是13-2=11块。接下來，他买了36块饼干，這些饼干包括他已經吃的2块，所以新买的餘下饼干是36-2=34块。因此，他买了比他吃的多多少块饼干？答案：沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果帕科有40块饼干，他吃了5块，那麽剩下的就是40-5=35块饼干。但是，問題提到了「把其中13块给了他的朋友」，這意味著帕科現在沒有13块饼干了。因此，帕科的餘下饼干是35-13=22块饼干。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 帕科有9块甜饼干和6块咸饼干，共計15块麵包。如果帕科吃了36块甜饼干和3块咸饼干，那麵包中就只剩下12块麵包（9+6=15-36-3=12）。因此，帕科現在剩下12块咸饼干。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paco有37块甜饼干和11块咸饼干，共計48块麵包。 如果他吃了5块甜饼干和2块咸饼干，那麵包中的甜饼干就是5+2=7块。 因此，Paco currently has 48-7=41块甜饼干 left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果帕科有8块甜饼干，那麼他有多少块甜饼干可以選擇吃？是8块。如果他吃了20块甜饼干，那麼他 left 的甜饼干就是20-8=12块。如果他吃了34块咸饼干，那麼他 left 的咸饼干就是34-12=22块。因此，他吃了多少块比甜饼干多的咸饼干？是22块。
 x - 36 = 37 x = 37 + 36 = 73 So, Paco originally had 73 pieces of crackers.
 36 - (14 + 10) = 22 pieces.
 32 - 18 = 14 pieces. Therefore, Paco has 14 pieces of crackers left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果帕科有6块饼干，他給了朋友30块饼干，那麼剩下的就是23块饼干。如果他給朋友的饼干比他吃的多多少块，那麼這些餘下的饼干都是帕科本人吃的。因此，沒有餘下的饼干可以給朋友。所以，答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paco有97块咸饼干和34块甜饼干，共計131块麵包。如果Paco已經吃了15块甜饼干，那麼現在Paco所持有的甜饼干就是34块 minus 15块 equals 19块。 So, the number of remaining sweets is 19.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paco有26块咸饼干，他吃了9块咸饼干，餘下的是26-9=17块咸饼干。然後，Paco有17块甜饼干，他吃了14块甜饼干，餘下的是17-14=3块甜饼干。因此，Paco現在沒有咸饼干和甜饼干。
 None
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Paco有40块甜饼干和25块咸饼干，共計65块麵包。  Paco吃了28块咸饼干和15块甜饼干，共計43块麵包。  Now we need to find out how many pieces of bread Paco ate that are sweeter than the original amount. Since he ate 15 pieces of sweet bread, we can subtract this number from the total amount of bread he ate to get the answer. So, the answer is 0.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money she spent. Let's see... if she received $7 and spent some money, then she must have spent less than $7. So, the amount of money she spent is between $0 and $7. Now, let's try to find the exact amount... Hmmm... I think she spent $3. Yes, that's right! She spent $3.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money Gawn has received from her mother and father. From the problem statement, we know that she received $2 from her mother and $4 from her father, so she has a total of $6. Next, we need to find out how much money Gawn spent. The problem states that she spent $3, so she has $6 - $3 = $3 left over. Therefore, Gawn has $3 left over after spending money on something.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money Gawn received from her mother and father separately. We know that she received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father, so the total amount she received is $8 + $5 = $13. Now, we need to find out how much money Gawnd spent. She spent $4, so the amount of money she has left after spending is $13 - $4 = $9. Therefore, Gawnd received more money from her mother than from her father.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money Gawn received from her mother and father separately. We know that she received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, so the total amount she received is $3 + $6 = $9. Now, we need to find out how much money Gawnd spent. She spent $4, so the amount of money she received from her parents minus the amount she spent is $9 - $4 = $5. Therefore, Gawnd received $5 more than she spent.

Next, we need to find out how much money Gwen's mother gave her. The problem states that she gave Gwen $7. Finally, we need to find out how much money Gwen spent. The problem does not provide this information directly, but we can infer that she spent at least some of the money her mother gave her. Therefore, the amount of money Gwen's mother gave her is more than the amount of money her father gave her.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money Gwen received from her father and mother separately. We know that she received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so the total amount of money she received is $5 + $2 = $7. Now, we need to find out how much money Gwen spent. She spent $6, so the difference between the amount of money she received and the amount she spent is $7 - $6 = $1. Therefore, Gwen received more money from her father than from her mother.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道馬可的草莓重19磅，而其父親的草莓重4磅。因此，馬可的草莓比其父親的重多少。如果我們將19磅÷4磅=4.75。所以，馬可的草莓比其父親的重4.75倍。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道馬可和他爸爸一起采到了35磅的草莓。其次，我們知道馬可的草莓重量為13磅。最後，我們知道他爸爸的草莓比他的重多少。因此，我們可以得出：他爸爸的草莓重量為35磅 - 13磅 = 22磅。所以，他爸爸的草莓比馬可的重多少是22磅。
 Weight of Mao's strawberries = Total weight of strawberries - Weight of his father's strawberries = 20 lb - 17 lb = 3 lb Therefore, the weight of Mao's strawberries is 3 pounds.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道馬可的草莓重8磅，而其父親的草莓重32磅。接下來，我們需要計算二者之間的比例。在這個情況下，我們可以使用「：」符號表示比例。因此，馬可的草莓重的比例是：8/32 = 0.25或25%。現在，我們可以計算二者之間的總重量。所以，馬可的草莓重的總重量是8磅 x 0.25 = 2磅，而其父親的草莓重的總重量是32磅 x 1 = 32磅。因此，二者的總重量為2 + 32 = 34磅。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬可和他爸爸一起采集了重达24磅的草莓。这意味着他們共采集了24磅的草莓。然後，在回家的路上，马可丢失了9磅的草莓。這意味着馬可現在的草莓重量为3磅。最後，我們需要知道马可父親的草莓重量。但是，根據問題，馬可父親沒有任何草莓。因此，馬可父親的草莓重量為零磅。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬可和他爸爸一起采集了36磅的草莓。如果他爸爸丟失了8磅的草莓，那么現在馬可的草莓重量为12磅。因此，馬可的爸爸的草莓 current weight is 36 - 8 = 28 pounds .
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬可和他爸爸一起采集了22磅的草莓。返程時，爸爸又找到了30磅的草莓，共計52磅（22+30）。現在，馬可的草莓重達36磅，意味著爸爸的草莓現在重量为52磅 minus 36磅 = 16磅。因此，爸爸的草莓現在重量是16磅。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道馬可的草莓重15磅。如果他們的草莓一起重37磅，那麼馬可的草莓的比例是什麼？等于：37磅 / 15磅 = 2.467... 這意味著馬可的草莓重了2.467...磅。因此，他爸爸的草莓重多少磅？等于：37磅 - 15磅 = 22磅。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道馬可的草莓重30磅，而其他人的草莓一起重17磅。因此，馬可的草莓的重量是17磅加上30磅的2/3。所以，馬可的草莓比其他人的重45磅（2/3 x 17磅）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道馬可的草莓重10磅，而其他的草莓重26磅。因此，馬可的草莓的比例是26/10=2.6。所以，馬可的父親的草莓比馬可的重2.6倍。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果有43个孩子坐在公交车上, then there are 43 children on the bus. If some of them get off at the next stop, there will be fewer children on the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the total number of children and the number of children left on the bus. In this case, the total number of children = 43, and the number of children left on the bus = 21, so the number of children who got off the bus = 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the next stop.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果有41个孩子坐在公共汽车上，那么在公共汽车站中有18个孩子下车。這意味著在公共汽车站之前，公共汽车上有23个孩子（41 - 18）。因此，在公共汽车站之前，比現在还有23个孩子在公共汽车上。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果有21个孩子坐在公交车上,那么当他们到达公交车站時,有10个孩子已经下車，餘下11个孩子仍然在公交车上。而後面提到的16个孩子都是在公交车上的，所以這16个孩子中就包含了原本11个孩子，因此沒有孩子在公交车站上了车。

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，面包师傅做了一些蛋糕。如果他卖掉了145个， значи是他做了的蛋糕数量加上145的和。所以，他一共做了多少个蛋糕？ 要解釋： 因為我們知道面包师傅卖掉了145个蛋糕，所以他剩下的蛋糕數量是72 - 145 = -73。這 means he has not made any more pies at all! So the answer is zero (0).
 155 - 140 = 15. So, the baker has 15 pizzas left. Therefore, the answer is 15.
 105 - 170 = -65. So, the baker now has -65 bread left. Since he doesn't have any bread left, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 面包师傅做了13个蛋糕，他卖掉了91个，那麼他現在拿到的是13-91=42個蛋糕。接下來，他买了154个新蛋糕，這意味著他已經拿到了42+154=196個蛋糕。因此，面包师傅买了196-42=154個蛋糕。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，面包师傅做了170个蛋糕。如果他卖掉了78个，那么他现在拥有的蛋糕数量是170 - 78 = 92个。接下來，他买了31个新蛋糕。因此，他現在拥有的蛋糕数量是92 + 31 = 123个。所以，他卖掉的蛋糕比他买的多多少个？答案：沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 面包师傅做了110个蛋糕，他卖掉了其中的75个，那麼現在面包师傅已經剩下35个蛋糕。接下來，面包师傅又做了76个蛋糕，這些新的蛋糕加上原本剩下的35个蛋糕，共計42个蛋糕。因此，面包师傅現在 still have 42 pieces of bread left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 面包师傅做了144个蛋糕，他卖掉了71个，餘下的是111个。接下來，面包师傅又做了111个蛋糕。如果他卖掉了之前做的71个蛋糕，那么現在他將要卖掉的蛋糕就是111-71=40个。因此，面包师傅比他卖掉的蛋糕多做了40个。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 面包师傅做了149个蛋糕和91个点心。如果他卖掉了10个蛋糕和90个点心，那么现在他已经卖完了10 + 90 = 100个物品。 remaining goods = total goods - sold goods = 149 - 100 = 49个蛋糕和41个点心。 So the answer is 49 bread and 41 points.
 15 + 103 = 118 pastries. So, the baker still has 118 pastries left.
 Number of bread rolls not sold = Total number of bread rolls - Sold bread rolls = 126 - 115 = 11 So, the baker did not sell 11 bread rolls.
" 88 From here, we can see that the baker sold more bread than he made (70 - 19 = 51). However, he sold fewer cakes than he made (88 - 131 = -43). So, the baker did not sell any extra cakes. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們需要知道面包师傅做了多少个蛋糕和糕点。 According to the problem, he made 157 bread rolls and 169 pastries. So, he made a total of 326 items. Now, we need to find out how many bread rolls and pastries he sold. If he sold 158 bread rolls and 147 pastries, then he sold more bread rolls than pastries. The difference between the number of bread rolls he sold and the number of bread rolls he made is 158 - 157 = 1. So, he sold one extra bread roll.
 Difference = Number of cakes - Number of tarts = 92 - 68 = 24 Therefore, there are 24 more cakes than tarts.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，面包师傅卖了44个蛋糕。如果他最初做了48个蛋糕， значи是他最初做的蛋糕中有44-48= -4个蛋糕。因此，他現在 still have 44-4=-39個蛋糕。 So the answer is -39.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道面包师傅卖了8个蛋糕。如果他最初做了40个蛋糕，那么他比卖出的蛋糕多做了40 - 8 = 32个蛋糕。因此，他比卖出的蛋糕多做了32个蛋糕。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道贝克最初做了169个蛋糕。其次，他的朋友从他那里买了137个蛋糕。因此，贝克现在剩下的蛋糕数量是：169 - 137 = 32。所以，贝克現在剩下32个蛋糕。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 面包师傅做了173个蛋糕。如果他买了103个新蛋糕，那么他已经卖掉了86个蛋糕（173 - 103 = 86）。因此，面包师傅現在 still have 86 pieces of bread left.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，面包师傅做了99个蛋糕。如果他买了167个新蛋糕，那么他已经把自己做出来的99个蛋糕全部卖掉了。因此，他现在只剩下卖掉的89个蛋糕。所以，面包师傅买了0个比他卖掉的多。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that the baker bought 139 eggs and sold 145 eggs. So, there are 6 more eggs sold than bought. Now, let's think about how many eggs the baker actually made. We know that he made 8 bread rolls, but each bread roll requires 2 eggs. Therefore, the baker made a total of 8 x 2 = 16 eggs. Since the baker sold 6 more eggs than he bought, he must have used the remaining 10 eggs to make the bread rolls (16 - 6 = 10). So, the answer is 10.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，面包师傅做了62个蛋糕。如果他卖掉了其中的144个，那么他現在 left behind 的蛋糕就是：

 102 - 94 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 more bread rolls than cakes.
 125 - 11 = 114 So, the baker sold 114 more cakes than he made.
 Number of bread rolls sold = Total number of bread rolls - Number of bread rolls sold = 14 - 8 = 6 So, the baker sold 6 bread rolls. Now, let's find out how many pastries he sold. Number of pastries sold = Total number of pastries - Number of pastries sold = 153 - 97 = 56 So, the baker sold 56 pastries. Therefore, the answer is 0.
 Difference = Total items sold - (Bread + Cakes) = 157 - (43 + 114) = 20 Therefore, there were 20 more cakes than bread sold by the baker.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設凱莉現在已經送出了91個任天堂游戲，那麼她最初有多少個游戲？  We can start by reasoning step by step. If Kayli has already sent out 91 Nintendo games, then she must have had more than 91 games initially. So the number of games Kayli had initially is greater than or equal to 91. Therefore, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設凱莉有20個任天堂游戲，共計20x7=140個游戲。如果她想剩下12個游戲，那麽她需要送走38個游戲（140-12）。因此，凯莉需要送走38個任天堂游戲才能剩下12個。

$$\max(0, Z+1-X)$$
這是因為凱莉不能將所有索尼游戲送走，因為她需要剩下的任天堂游戲。

例如，假設凱莉有 $46$ 個任天堂游戲和 $132$ 個索尼游戲，剩下的索尼游戲就是 $86$ 個。在這種情況下，凱莉可以將索尼游戲送走的最大數量是 $\max(0, 86-46)=40$。"
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設凱莉有80個任天堂游戲，共分為31個和59個。如果她想將其中的31個游戲送走，那麼剩下的就是59個游戲。如果她想將其中的59個游戲送走，那麼剩下的就是31個游戲。因此，凱莉不需要送走任何游戲，所以答案是沒有。

Next, we need to find out how many blocks he used to build a tower and how many blocks he used to build a house. The problem states that he used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for the house to find the answer. So, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many blocks Randi used to build the tower and the house. According to the problem, he used 79 blocks to build the tower and 82 blocks to build the house. Next, we need to find out how many blocks Randi had in total. According to the problem, he had 86 blocks in total. Finally, we can calculate the number of blocks Randi used to build the house by subtracting the number of blocks he used to build the tower from the total number of blocks he had. So, the answer is 0 blocks.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many blocks Randi used to build the tower. According to the problem, he used 36 blocks. Now, let's assume that Randi has 59 blocks in total. How many blocks does he have left? To find this out, we can divide the number of blocks Randi has by the number of blocks he used to build the tower. In this case, we would divide 59 blocks by 36 blocks, which gives us 1.62 blocks (or 162%). So, Randi has 162% more blocks than he needed to build the tower! This means he still has some blocks left over after building the tower. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果兰迪有95個積木，他可以使用20個積木建立一個房子，那麼他 still have 75個積木 left. 如果他用50個積木建立了一個塔，那麼他 will use up 50-20=30個積木. So he has used a total of 30+75=105個積木. Therefore, the number of blocks he used to build the tower is 105-50=55 blocks.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果兰迪有90個積木，他可以使用其中的89個積木建立房子。餘下的1個積木可以用來建立塔。因此，兰迪用建房子的積木比建塔用的積木多出1個積木。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many books the person has read in total. We are told that there are 20 different books in the series, and the person has not read any of them yet. Therefore, the number of books the person has read is zero (0).
 13 + 8 = 21 books.
 10 movies Now, we need to find out how many books you have read and movies you have watched. Let's assume you have read all the books in Series 1 and 2, which means you have read a total of 4 + 8 = 12 books. As for the movies, since you have watched 56 movies, that means you haven't watched any from Series 1 or 2, as there are only 3 and 7 movies respectively in those series. Therefore, the answer is zero!
" There are 4 books and 17 movies in the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series. If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, that means you still need to watch 10 more movies. So, the answer is 10."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, let's think about the number of books and movies in each series separately. For the book series, there are 16 different titles, so there must be at least 16 books in total. For the movie series, there are 14 different titles, so there must be at least 14 movies in total. Now, let's assume that you have read 19 books from the series. This means that there are at most 19 - 16 = 3 books left in the series that you haven't read. Similarly, if you have watched 13 movies from the series, this means that there are at most 14 - 13 = 1 movie left in the series that you haven't watched. Therefore, the answer is zero (0) books in the series exceed the number of movies you have watched.
"沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, let's think about the number of books in the series. According to the problem, there are 8 different books in the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series. Now, if we read 19 books from this series, that means we have read all 8 books at least once. So, the total number of books read is 8 + 19 = 27 books. Next, let's think about the number of movies in the series. The problem states that there are 10 different movies in the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series. If we watch 61 movies from this series, that means we have watched each movie at least once. So, the total number of movies watched is 10 + 61 = 71 movies. Since we have read 27 books and watched 71 movies, the number of movies watched exceeds the number of books read by 71 - 27 = 44 movies. Therefore, there are 44 more movies than books in the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, let's think about the books and movies separately. For the books, there are 10 different titles, so if you have read 13 of them, that means you have not read 7 of them (13 - 10 = 7). Similarly, for the movies, there are 11 different titles, so if you have watched 12 of them, that means you have not watched 9 of them (11 - 12 = 9). Now, let's compare how many books you have read to how many movies you have watched. You have read 7 books more than you have watched movies (7 - 9 = -2). Therefore, you have read more books than you have watched movies by a total of 7 books.
 7 x 7 = 49 So, you have watched 49 movies after reading 7 books.
 x = 6 . Therefore, you still need to read 6 more books in the series.
" There are 62 different movies and 19 different books in the ""Crazy Madhouse"" series. If you have read 4 books from this series, that means there are 62 - 4 = 58 different books left to read. Now, let's consider how many movies you have watched. The problem states that you have watched 34 parts of movies, which means there are 34 / 3 = 11 movies left to watch. So, if you want to read all the remaining books, you need to read 58 books."
" There are 8 movies and 21 books in the ""Crazy Potato School"" series. If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, that means there are 21 - 7 = 14 books left to read and 8 - 4 = 4 movies left to watch. So, you still need to watch 4 movies."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, let's think about the number of books in the series. According to the problem, there are 15 different books in the series. Now, let's consider how many books you have read. You have read 11 books from the series. Therefore, the number of books you haven't read is 15 - 11 = 4. So, there are 4 more books in the series than the movies.
 11 = 5.64 (round down to nearest whole number) Therefore, there are 5 more movies in the series than books.
"  There are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series. If you have read 14 books and watched 19 movies, that means you have read more books than movies. So, the number of books you have read is greater than 19. However, we are not told how many books you have read beyond 14, so we cannot say exactly how many more books you have read. Therefore, the answer is ""没有"" (there isn't)."

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Dave has won 7 tickets to the game. Let's call this number x. Then, he used some of these tickets to buy toys. This means he has x - 2 tickets left. So, the total number of tickets Dave used to buy toys is 2. Therefore, the answer is 0.
 x = 26. Therefore, Dave won 26 tickets at the amusement park.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Dave has 18 tickets and he uses 5 tickets to buy some toys. Now he has 13 tickets left. Then he uses 11 tickets to buy some clothes. So, he has 2 tickets left. Therefore, the answer is 2.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Dave has 19 tickets to the amusement park and he uses 12 tickets to buy some toys. Then he uses 7 tickets to buy some clothes. How many tickets does he have left? We can start by using the information that Dave has 19 tickets in total. He uses 12 tickets to buy some toys, so he has 19 - 12 = 7 tickets left. Then he uses 7 tickets to buy some clothes, so he has 7 tickets left. Therefore, the answer is 0 tickets.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Dave has 13 tickets to the amusement park and he uses 8 of them to buy some toys. Then, he uses 18 more tickets to buy some clothes. How many tickets does he use to buy clothes compared to the number of tickets he used to buy toys? There are no tickets left over after buying both toys and clothes. So, the answer is zero (0).
 1. Dave has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left after winning and losing some games. 2. He uses 10 tickets to buy toys, so he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
 9 So, there are 5 fewer trees that survived the hurricane than were planted by Haley. Therefore, the answer is zero (0).
 13 - 6 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 more living trees than dead trees.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Haley在她的後院种了20棵樹，然後有一場台风來襲，結果只剩下4棵樹。如果我們知道20棵樹中有多少棵 tree died during the typhoon? Then we can find out how many trees survived the typhoon by subtracting the number of dead trees from the total number of trees planted. So, if x trees died during the typhoon, then the number of surviving trees is 20 - x. Therefore, there are no dead trees because the total number of trees planted (20) is equal to the number of surviving trees (4).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Haley在她的後院种了一些樹。  After the typhoon passed, 5 trees died.  So, there are still 12 trees left.  But the question asks how many trees Haley planted.  Therefore, the answer is zero (0).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Haley在她的後院种了9棵樹。然後，台风过後，有4棵樹死了。最後，她又种了5棵樹。如果她現在還有多少棵樹？  Firstly, we know that Haley planted 9 trees in her backyard. Then, after the typhoon, 4 of them died. Finally, she planted additional 5 trees. So, the total number of trees Haley has now is... (calculate) ...0! That's right! After losing 4 trees and adding 5 new ones, Haley still has 0 trees in her backyard.
 Number of trees left = Initial number of trees - Number of dead trees = 12 - 2 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 trees left in Haili's backyard after the typhoon.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道海莉最初种了3棵树。這些树可能是其他地方被風吹倒或者生長不好等原因而死了。然後，我們知道13棵树死了。這意味著有10棵（13-3）棵树没有死。因此，海莉最终有7棵树还活着。答案：7。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道海莉最初种了11棵树。然後，我們知道2棵树 died after the typhoon. So, there are 9 trees left. But then we are asked how many trees are still alive. Since all the trees that were initially planted by Helen are dead, including the 2 that died after the typhoon, there are no living trees. Therefore, the answer is zero (0).

 24 x 46 = 1080 baskets of unripe oranges Therefore, after 45 days, they will have 1080 baskets of unripe oranges.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道每天采摘了44袋熟橙和25袋未熟橙。如果我們只是采摘熟橙，那麼每天采摘的熟橙就是44袋。如果我們還要采摘未熟橙，那麼每天采摘的熟橙就是44袋 + 25袋 = 69袋。因此，每天采摘的熟橙比未熟橙多多少袋？ → 答案：69袋 - 44袋 = 25袋。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果每天采摘5袋熟橙，那麼每天采摘的未熟橙就是5袋熟橙的整除（divide）。例如，如果今天采摘了10袋熟橙，那麼今天采摘的未熟橙就是5袋熟橙的整除（divide），即3袋未熟橙。因此，每天采摘的未熟橙比熟橙多多少袋？就是3袋。
  He needs to harvest for 3 days.
 56 bags / 14 days = 4 bags per day Now, we know that they picked 4 bags of oranges per day for 14 days. Therefore, they picked a total of 4 x 14 = 56 bags of oranges. So, the answer is 56 bags of oranges.
 5 x 73 = 365 ripe oranges! So, in total, they will have 1825 + 365 = 2190 oranges.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果每天采摘71袋未熟橙子，那麼每天采摘的熟橙子就是71-60=11袋。因此，每天采摘的未熟橙子比熟橙子多多少袋是11-60=50袋。
 Length / Width = (12 / 11) = 1.09 So, Jesse's room is about 1 foot and 1 inches longer than it is wide.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how long the room is in feet. We are given that the length of Jesse's room is 7 feet. Now, we need to convert this value from feet to square feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are 96 inches in 7 feet (7 x 12 = 96). Therefore, the length of Jesse's room in square feet is 96 square feet. Next, we need to find out how wide the room is. The problem states that Jesse needs a rug with an area of 14 square feet. Since the length of the room is already known, we can use the width of the room to find its length. So, if the width of the room is w feet, then the length of the room is 96 square feet / w = w feet. Solving for w, we get w = 72 feet. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 72 feet.
 Area of carpet = Length x Width = 14 sq ft x 7 ft = 98 sq ft Therefore, the length of the room is 98 feet.
 Number of Rugs = Room Area / Existing Rug Area = 165 / 16 = 10 rugs So, Jessie needs 10 rugs to cover the entire floor of her room.
 Area = Length x Width = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Now, we need to find out how many tiles Jesse needs to cover the entire floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the floor (which is given in the problem) by the area of one tile. Total area of the floor = 200 square feet Area per tile = 24 square feet Therefore, Jesse needs 8 tiles to cover the entire floor. So, the answer is 8 tiles.
 Total Area (in square meters) = Total Area (in square feet) x Conversion Factor Total Area (in square meters) = 6,840 x 0.0929 = 627.5 square meters
 20 ft / 19 ft = 1.053 (approximately) So, Jesse's room is about 1.053 times longer than its width.
 Width = Half of length = 9 feet 6 inches / 2 = 4 feet 8 inches Therefore, the width of the room is 4 feet 8 inches.
 2 x 12 = 24 feet.
 Amount of space left uncovered = Total area of the room - Area of the rug = 80 - 18 = 62 square feet Therefore, there is no remaining space left uncovered after covering the entire floor with the rug.
 Number of shirts = Total amount earned / Price per shirt = $230 / $23 = 10 shirts Therefore, they sold 10 shirts during the competition period.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think about the problem step by step. We know that the t-shirts were sold during a competition in Arkansas and Texas Inst...
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many T-shirts were sold in total during the Arkansas game and the Texas A&M game. We are told that they sold a total of 95 T-shirts. Now, let's find out how many T-shirts were sold in each game separately. If they sold 47 T-shirts in the Arkansas game, then they sold 48 - 47 = 1 T-shirt in the Texas A&M game. So, they earned $87 x 1 = $87 from selling T-shirts during the Texas A&M game. Therefore, their total earnings from selling T-shirts is $87 + $87 = $174.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many T-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. If they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold a total of 242 - 115 = 127 T-shirts during both games combined.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money they made from the Texas Tech game. Since they sold 89 T-shirts during that game, and each T-shirt costs $98, then they made a total of $8,722 ($98 x 89) from the Texas Tech game. Now, let's find out how much money they made from the Arkansas game. They sold 74 T-shirts during that game, and each T-shirt costs $98, so they made a total of $7,056 ($98 x 74) from the Arkansas game. Therefore, the total amount of money they made from both games is $8,722 + $7,056 = $15,778.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they made $78 x 172 = $13,040 in profit. Next, we need to find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Since they sold a total of 186 t-shirts during both games, and they made $13,040 during the Arkansas game, then they made $13,040 / 2 = $6,520 in profit during the Texas Tech game. Therefore, the answer is $6,520.
 $11,506 + $3,079 = $14,585.
 $25,340 - $4,898 = $20,442 So, Razorback Merchandise made $20,442 from selling jerseys during these two games.
 $19 per T-shirt x 157 T-shirts = $2,863 Total Revenue $34 per jersey x 19 jerseys = $656 Total Revenue Therefore, there is no difference in price between a T-shirt and a jersey.
" Difference = Total revenue (J) - Total revenue (T) = $9,756 - $21,940 = $-12,184 This means that each jersey costs more than each T-shirt by $12.18. So, the answer is ""none"" because there is no difference between the price of a T-shirt and a jersey."
 Total Revenue = Total Revenue Before Discount + Total Revenue After Discount Total Revenue = $6,430 + $5,470 = $11,900 So, the answer is $11,900.
 Profit = $2,850 - $203.86 = $2,646.14 Therefore, the answer is $2,646.14.
 x / 10 = 6x. Solving for x, we get x = 60 / 10 = 6. Therefore, the store sold 6 T-shirts during the competition period.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many T-shirts the store sold during the competition. According to the problem, the store earned $215 from selling T-shirts. If each T-shirt costs x dollars, then the total amount of money the store earned from selling T-shirts is 215x. Since the store sold 5 T-shirts, we can set up the equation 5x = 215. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us x = 43. So, each T-shirt cost $43.
 64 x $5 = $320 So, in total, they earned $4,300 + $320 = $4,620. Therefore, the answer is $4,620.
 $152 x 2 = $304 Therefore, the answer is $32,072 - $304 = $31,768
 Difference between T-shirt and basketball jersey prices = $240 - $210 = $30 So, on average, a T-shirt costs $30 more than a basketball jersey.
 Difference = J - T = $9,070 - $2,825 = $6,245 So, the basketball jerseys cost $6,245 more than the T-shirts.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他們有5套桌子，每套桌子有10把椅子，那麼共有5 x 10 = 50把椅子。因此，他們不會多多少把椅子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他們有 two sets of tables and each set has the same number of chairs, then we can say that there are twice as many chairs as tables. So, if there are 12 chairs in total, and he has 2 sets of tables, then there must be 6 chairs on each table. Therefore, there are 6 chairs on each table.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他們有9把椅子，那麼他們可能會用3把椅子來設置桌子。因此，他們需要3套桌子。但是，問題中没有提到他們使用了多少套桌子，所以答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  If they have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 11 x 13 = 133 chairs.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  If there are 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  If 11 people sit on the chairs, then we have used 60 - 11 = 49 chairs. So, there are 49 chairs left unused.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他們有12套桌子，每套桌子有14把椅子，共計12 x 14 = 168把椅子。然後，還有额外的6把椅子，共計168 + 6 = 174把椅子。因此，他們为客人准备了174把椅子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他們有4套桌子，每套桌子有3把椅子，那麼合計就是12把椅子（4套桌子 x 3把椅子/套）。如果他們有14位嘉賓，那麼他們不需要任何椅子。因此，答案是沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他們有9套桌子，那麼每套桌子有14把椅子。因此，他們共有9 x 14 = 126把椅子。所以，他們比桌子多了126把椅子。
 Weekly earnings = Total amount earned / Number of weeks worked In this case, Lui's weekly earnings are $460 / 4.6 = $100 per week. Therefore, Lui earned $100 per week.
 $1216 = 16w Where w is the number of weeks. Now, we solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by $16. $1216 ÷ $16 = w Therefore, there were w = 78 weeks in the season.
 $$ {1048 - 702} = 346$$ dollars left after paying taxes. Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $346.
 $$ \therefore Total earnings = 306,913 x 73 = $22,483,330$$ So, the answer is $22,483,330.
 Harvest Season Total weeks = 1091 weeks x $28/week = $27,648 Overtime Total hours worked = ? x $939/hour = ? Total overtime earnings = ? Total income = Harvest season income + Overtime earnings = $27,648 + ? = ? So, Louis will make a total of $27,648 plus his overtime earnings.
"

$9,290 - ($49 x 23) = $8,752

Therefore, Louis earned a total of $8,752 during the harvest season."
"

$368 x 13 = $4,724 in income during the harvest season
-$388 x 13 = $5,054 in rent payments during the same period

So, Louis has paid a total of $5,054 in rent during the harvest season, not including any other expenses or savings he may have made during that time."
 Louis repeats the same process, earning $491 and paying $216 in rent, leaving him with $275 ($275 + $275 = $550). And so on... At the end of the harvest season (which is 1181 weeks), Louis will have a total of $63,375 ($550 x 1181) left after paying his rent for all those weeks.
 $133 / 19 = $7 per week. So, Louis earns $7 per week.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 路易斯每周賺2美元，那麼他每月賺2 x 4 = 8美元。因此，他在一個月內賺了8美元。如果他总共賺了178美元，那麼他 must have worked for 178 / 8 = 22.3 weeks。So, he worked for 22 weeks and 3 days.
 Ratio = Water depth / Devin's height = x ft / 9 ft = 10x Now, we know that Devin is 10 times taller than the depth of the water. So, if the water is 10 feet deep, then Devin is 100 feet tall (10 x 10).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Water's depth is twice as tall as Dean. Since Dean is 6 feet (72 inches) tall, the water is at least 144 inches deep. Now, we need to find out how tall Roan is. According to the problem, Roan is 8 feet shorter than Dean, which means he is 5 feet 6 inches (66 inches) tall. So, the water is actually 200 inches deep.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, after they rested, they decided to go swimming. The water depth is 5 times Roan's height. Since Dien is shorter than Roan by 11 feet, we can conclude that Roan is 12 feet tall. Therefore, the water is at least 60 feet deep (5 x 12 = 60).
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Water's depth is 15 times Devin's height. Devin is 4 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at a point that is 13 feet deep in the water, how deep is the water? We can start by using the information given in the problem to find out how tall Devin is. According to the problem, Devin is 15 times taller than Ron. This means that if Ron is x feet tall, Devin is 15x feet tall. Since Devin is 4 feet taller than Ron, we know that Devin is x + 4 feet tall. Now, let's use this information to find out how deep the water is. According to the problem, the water is 15 times deeper than it is wide. So, if the water is x feet deep where Ron is standing, it will be 15x feet deep where Devin is standing. But since Devin is x + 4 feet tall, the water must be x + 4 feet deeper where he is standing. Therefore, the water is x + 4 feet deeper where Devin is standing.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, after they rested, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 16 times Roan's height. If Roan stands at a point that is 13 feet deep, how deep is the water? We can start by using the information given in the problem to find out how tall Roan is. According to the problem, Roan is 5 feet 9 inches tall. So, if he stands at a point that is 13 feet deep, his head will be at a height of 13 + 5 = 18 feet above the surface of the water. Now, we need to find out how much deeper the water is than Roan's head. Since the depth of the water is 16 times Roan's height, and Roan's height is 5 feet 9 inches, the depth of the water is 16 x 5 = 80 feet. Therefore, the water is 80 feet deep where Roan is standing.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that the depth of the water is 9 times Devin's height. So, if Devin's height is 5 feet (which is equal to 60 inches), then the depth of the water would be 5 x 9 = 450 inches. Now, we are told that Ron is 15 feet tall, which means he is 180 inches tall. Since Devin is 6 inches shorter than Ron, Devin's height would be 180 - 6 = 174 inches. Therefore, the depth of the water would be 450 inches minus 174 inches = 276 inches.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 假設卡罗尔購買了$N$個包装，每個包装 contains $2$ invitation cards. Then, the total number of invitation cards that Carole can buy is $\frac{N}{2}$. Since each friend needs at least one invitation card, we need to make sure that the total number of invitation cards is greater than or equal to the number of friends she wants to invite. Therefore, we must have $\frac{N}{2} \geq 10$. Solving for $N$, we get $N \geq 50$. So, Carole needs at least $50$ packages to ensure that all her friends are invited.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many friends Carole has invited. Let's assume she has invited 12 friends in total. Now, each bag contains the same number of invitation cards as there are friends invited. So, if there are 3 bags, then the number of invitation cards in each bag is 12 / 3 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 invitation cards in each bag.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Carol bought 7 packages of invitations, and each package contains 10 invitations. So, in total, Carol bought 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Now, we are asked how many invitations Carol will have left if she sends them to only 2 friends. To find out, we need to subtract the number of invitations sent to 2 friends from the total number of invitations bought by Carol. So, the answer is 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over. Therefore, there are 68 invitations left over after Carol sends them to her 2 friends.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道梅丽莎在13場比赛中得到了91分。这意味着她每场比赛得到的分数都是相同的。接下来，我们要知道她每场比赛得到的分数多少。但是，问题并没有提供这个信息。因此，我们无法 directly answer the question. So, there is no answer to this problem.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道天堂公園的摩天轮有4個座位。其次，我們知道摩天轮可以同時乘坐20個人。最後，我們知道每個座位可以容纳多少人。因此，我們可以得出答案：沒有。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先, 天堂公园的摩天轮有一些座位。这意味着它有一定数量的 seat。 secondly, each seat can accommodate 9 people. This means that the total number of seats is 9 times the number of seats per rotation. Finally, if the rotating wheel can carry 18 people at a time, then the number of rotations required to fill all the seats is 18 / 9 = 2 rotations. Therefore, there are 2 x 9 = 18 seats in the Ferris wheel.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，每个天堂公园的摩天轮有19个座位。这意味着共有19 x 15 = 285个 seat available for riders。Now, we need to find out how many people can ride on 20 rotorblades at a time. To do this, we divide the total number of seats by the number of rotorblades. So, in this case, we have 285 seats / 20 rotorblades = 14.25 people per rotorblade. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride on 20 rotorblades at a time is 14.25 x 20 = 285 people.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many seats are available for passengers in the Ferris wheel. According to the problem, each seat can accommodate 15 people, so there are 18 x 15 = 270 seats available. Now, let's assume that 10 seats are broken or unavailable. This means that there are only 270 - 10 = 260 seats left for passengers to ride the Ferris wheel. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at any given time is 260.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先, 天堂公园的摩天轮有6個座位。每個座位可以容纳14個人。現在有16個人在摩天轮上。要知道是否能夠添加更多人。我們需要計算出 available seat 的數量。available seat = total seat - occupied seat available seat = 6 - 16 = -10 Therefore, we cannot add more people to the Ferris wheel because there are no available seats.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先, 天堂公园的摩天轮有2个小座位和23个大座位。如果每个小座位可以容纳14人，那么小座位的总容量是14 x 2 = 28人。如果大座位可以容纳54人，那么大座位的总容量是54 x 1 = 54人。因此，摩天轮上可以坐的最多人数是28 + 54 = 82人。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先, 天堂公园的摩天轮有3个小座位和7个大座位。如果每个小座位可以容纳16人，那么三个小座位可以容纳16 x 3 = 48人。如果大座位可以容纳12人，那么7个大座位可以容纳12 x 7 = 84人。因此，摩天轮上可以容纳48 + 84 = 132人坐在大座位上。
16 x 2 = 32people.Therefore, each seat can accommodate 8 people.
 2x / 4 = x. Therefore, there are no seats on the Ferris wheel.
 98 / 7 = 14 slices per pizza So, each pizza has 14 slices.
 2 x 28 = 56 pancakes. So, we have 56 pancakes in total.
 68 / 25 = 2.72 pieces of pizza per person. So, there are approximately 2.72 pieces of pizza per person.
 90 / 2 = 45 pieces of pizza. So, each person will get 45 pieces of pizza.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many flower beds they have. According to the problem, there are 45 flower beds. Next, we need to find out how many seeds each flower bed has. The problem states that they put 10 seeds in each flower bed. Therefore, the total number of seeds they planted is 45 x 10 = 450 seeds.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many flower beds there are in total. According to the problem, Patch is helping his mother plant flowers in 9 flower beds. So, the total number of flower beds is 9. Next, we need to find out how many seeds each flower bed has. According to the problem, Patch and his mother together planted 45 seeds in all the flower beds. Since they planted them equally among the 9 flower beds, each flower bed has 5 seeds (45 / 9 = 5). Therefore, each flower bed has 5 seeds.
" How many flower beds do they have?
They planted 36 seeds in total, so there are 36 / 12 = 3 flower beds.

So, they have 3 flower beds with 12 seeds each, for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 seeds. But we know that only 58 seeds germinated, which means that some seeds did not grow into flowers.

Therefore, the answer is 0 flower beds."
 4 x 15 = 60 Finally, we can see that they did not grow any flowers because the answer is 0.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, Patch is helping his mother plant flowers in 10 flower beds. Each flower bed has 10 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds is 10 x 10 = 100 seeds. Since they have 60 seeds, that means they have used 40 seeds (60 - 100). So, there are 40 flower beds.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many flower beds there are in total. According to the problem, Patch is helping his mother plant flowers in 8 flower beds. So, there are 8 flower beds in total. Next, we need to find out how many seeds each flower bed can hold. The problem states that they have planted 32 seeds in total, and since they are planting them in 8 flower beds, each flower bed can hold 4 seeds (32 / 8 = 4). Now, let's assume that Patch and his mother are planting the same number of seeds in each flower bed. If they are planting 4 seeds in each flower bed, then the number of seeds they are planting in each flower bed is 4. Since there are 8 flower beds in total, the number of seeds they are planting in all the flower beds together is 8 x 4 = 32. Therefore, Patch and his mother are planting a total of 32 seeds in all the flower beds.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬修有8块麵包，他想要分给朋友。secondly，他想要给每个朋友2块麵包，which means he will give a total of 16 pieces to his friends. Finally, since there are 8 pieces in total and he wants to give each friend 2 pieces, the number of friends he can give them to is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How many pieces of bread can Marty give to each of his 5 friends if he wants to divide them equally?  If there are 15 pieces of bread in total and Marty has 5 friends, then each friend will get 3 pieces of bread (15 / 5 = 3). Now, how much bread is left after Marty gives it to his friends?  There are still 10 pieces of bread left (15 - 3 = 10). So, the answer is none!
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬修有24块麵包，想要平均分給他的3個朋友，每人得到8块麵包。然後，我們知道馬修給了他的朋友17块麵包，這意味著他給了自己的朋友17/3=5块麵包多。因此，馬修給了他的朋友5块麵包。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How many pieces of bread can one person eat? Let's assume that each person can eat an equal number of slices of bread. Therefore, the total number of slices of bread that 11 people can eat is 11 x 22 = 242 slices. Now, how many cakes can one person eat? Let's assume that each person can eat an equal number of cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes that 11 people can eat is 11 x 34 = 374 cakes. So, if Ma Tsu gives an equal number of bread and cakes to his 11 friends, then each friend will get 242/11 = 22 slices of bread and 374/11 = 34 cakes.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬修有29块饼干和30块蛋糕。如果他把相同数量的饼干和蛋糕分给他的两个朋友，那么每个人就會得到14.5块蛋糕（29/2 + 30/2 = 14.5）。因此，每个人不会得到任何块蛋糕。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Marcus has 14 pieces of bread and 21 pieces of cake. If he wants to divide them equally among his 7 friends, each friend will get how many pieces of bread and cake? Let's see... if Marcus has 14 pieces of bread and there are 7 friends, then each friend will get 14/7 = 2 pieces of bread. And if Marcus has 21 pieces of cake and there are 7 friends, then each friend will get 21/7 = 3 pieces of cake. So, each friend will get 2 pieces of bread and 3 pieces of cake. But the problem says that Marcus gave each friend an equal number of bread and cake, so each friend got 2 pieces of bread and 3 pieces of cake. Therefore, the answer is 0.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬修有36块饼干。如果他給每個朋友分配相同數量的饼干，那麽每個朋友會得到36/n块饼干，其中n是整數。例如，如果馬修給每個朋友分配5块饼干，那麽每個朋友會得到36/5=7块饼干。因此，每個朋友不會得到任何饼干。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬修給了每個朋友6块饼干，這意味著他為了36块饼干，需要給36/6=6個朋友饼干。因此，馬修給了6個朋友饼干。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果馬修有23块餅乾，他分給了其中的2块餅乾給了第一個朋友，那麼第一個朋友已經吃了2块餅乎。如果他再次分給了2块餅乎，那麼第二個朋友也已經吃了2块餅乎。因此，馬修現在剩下的餅乎是11块。所以，每個朋友吃了5块餅乎（2+2=5）。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果馬修有31块餅干，他把相同數量的餅干給了他的5個朋友，那麼每位朋友就得到了62块餅干（31块÷5人）。而馬修現在剩下的餅干是23块，這意味著他給了每位朋友的62块餅干，然後剩下了23块餅干。因此，馬修給了每位朋友的62块餅干。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，馬修給每個朋友分配了相同數量的饼干和蛋糕。因此，每個朋友都得到了4個饼干和4個蛋糕。接下來，我們需要知道馬修最初有多少块饼干和蛋糕。根據問題，馬修最初有32块饼干和98块蛋糕。因此，每個朋友都得到了4個饼干和4個蛋糕，共計16個（4 x 4）。所以，每個朋友吃了16個饼干和蛋糕。

One way is to divide the 12 pens into three groups of 4 pens each. So, each row will have 4 pens. Therefore, there are 4 pens in each row. Is this correct?
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果菲把她的铅笔放在每行16支的行里，那么她可以做多少行?  Firstly, we need to find out how many rows she can write with 28 packets of pencils. Each packet contains 24 pencils, so the total number of pencils is 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Since each row requires 16 pencils, she can write 672 / 16 = 43 rows. Therefore, she can write 43 rows.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 菲放置她的铅笔，每行有22支铅笔。如果她有6盒铅笔，每盒有14支铅笔，那麼她一共有6 x 14 = 84支铅笔。因此，她一共有84支铅笔。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 菲把她的铅笔放在每行5支的行里. 如果她有35支铅笔和7支蜡笔，則可以將這些物品分配到每行5支的行中： 铅笔：35支 / 5支 = 7 rows (每行5支) 蜡笔：7支 / 5支 = 1 row (每行5支) 因此，菲可以做7行。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, let's count the number of steel pens and pencils that she has in total. We know that there are 19 rows, and each row has 4 steel pens and 27 pencils. Therefore, the total number of steel pens is 19 x 4 = 76, and the total number of pencils is 19 x 27 = 503. Now, we need to find out how many steel pens she has. Since she has 76 steel pens, and there are no other types of pens, then she must have all 76 steel pens. So, the answer is 76.
 210 pencils / 7 rows = 30 pencils per row Therefore, she has 30 pencils in each row, and there are 7 rows in total, so she has a total of 210 pencils.
 27 pens per column x 11 columns = 297 pens (all are wooden pens) So, there are a total of 310 + 297 = 597 pens in the table.

 7 x 21 = 147 seats (since each bus has 7 seats and there are 21 students in each class) Therefore, there are 147 seats available on each school bus.
 10,730 / 2.1 = 5,061 students. So, there are approximately 5,061 students in this school.
 4320 students / 6 seats/bus = 720 buses Therefore, we would need 720 buses to transport all the students on this field trip.
 58 students / 2 = 29 buses. So, we would need at least 29 buses for the field trip. However, since each bus can only carry a maximum of 2 students, we actually need more than 29 buses. Let me explain why... If we have 29 buses, each bus can carry up to 2 students, so the total number of students that can fit in all 29 buses is 2 x 29 = 58 students. But this is still not enough to accommodate all 87 classes! To solve this problem, we need to use some creative thinking. One possible solution is to have multiple buses traveling together, with each bus carrying a different group of classes. For example, if we have 3 buses, each bus could carry 29 classes (since there are 29 buses in total). This means that each bus would be carrying a total of 29 x 3 = 87 classes. Another possibility is to have some classes ride on the same bus as their teachers or other staff members. For instance, if we have 4 buses, each bus could carry 22 classes (since there are 87 classes in total), and then the remaining 10 classes could ride on the buses with their teachers or other staff members. In either case, we would need more than 29 buses to accommodate all 87 classes on the field trip.
" 28 students/classroom x 24 classrooms = 676 students So, there are approximately 676 students in the school. However, since the question asks for a specific answer, we cannot give a range like ""approximately."" Therefore, the final answer is 676 students."
 80 students / 8 seats per bus = 10 buses needed. Therefore, 10 school buses are needed for the field trip.
 3060 - 8 = 3052 students.
 111 / 216 = 0.52 school buses. So, we need at least 0.52 school buses for this trip. However, since you can't have a fraction of a school bus, we will round up to 1 full school bus. Therefore, we need 1 school bus for this trip.
 If all 46 buses are fully occupied, then the total number of seats available is 46 x 50 = 2300 seats. However, since not all students will be able to fit on each bus (some may have more than one student per seat), we can safely assume that the actual number of seats used by the students will be less than this amount.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Haley有23颗弹珠，共有4人，每人分配15颗剩下的弹珠。  So, each person will get 15/4 = 3.75颗弹珠。 Since we can't divide a whole number by a fraction, the answer is no one gets any beads.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's count the number of boys who like to play marbles. There are 13 boys in total, and they all like to play marbles. Now, let's count the number of boys who like to play cards. There are 50 boys in total, and they all like to play cards. Since Haley has 26 marbles, we can divide them equally among the 13 boys who like to play marbles. Each boy will get 26/13 = 2 marbles. Now, let's see how many cards each boy will get. If there are 50 boys and each boy gets 2 marbles, then there are 50 - 13 = 37 boys left. And each of these boys will get 26/37 = 0.7 cards on average. So, no one will get any cards.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Frank reads 22 pages every day. So, the number of days he spends reading the book is equal to the total number of pages in the book divided by the number of pages he reads per day. In this case, the book has 1080 pages (569 days / 22 pages/day = 1080 pages). Therefore, the answer is 1080 pages.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many pages Frank read each day. We are given that he spent 6 days reading the book and that there are 612 pages in total. So, if he spent 6 days reading the book, then he must have read $\frac{612}{6} = 102$ pages per day on average.
 pages/chapter = pages/chapter x 5 (number of chapters) = pages/chapter x 5 = pages Thus, each chapter in the book contains pages.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many chapters are in the book. According to the problem, the book has 15 chapters. Next, we need to find out how long Frank took to read each chapter. The problem states that he spent 660 days reading the book, and since there are 15 chapters, he spent 44 days (660 / 15) reading each chapter on average. Therefore, Frank read one chapter every 44 days.
 3 days x 249 pages/day = 747 pages In total, Frank read 747 pages.
 792 pages / 66 pages per book = 12 books. So, Frank read 12 books in total.
 x = 70 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 70 pages per day.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many days Frank needs to read the book. We are told that he reads 8 pages per day, so he will finish reading the book in x days, where x is the number of pages divided by 8. In this case, there are 576 pages in the book, so x = 576 / 8 = 72 days. Therefore, Frank needs 72 days to read his favorite book.
 Total number of pages = 450 pages/chapter x 41 chapters = 18,500 pages Number of days = 30 days So, Frank read 18,500 / 30 = 616.7 pages per day.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Frank spent reading the book. According to the problem, he spent 607 days reading it. Now, let's convert this time into pages read per day. We know that there are 3 chapters in the book, and each chapter has 594 pages. So, if Frank spent 607 days reading the book, then he must have read an average of 208 pages per day (607 days / 3 chapters). Therefore, each chapter has approximately 208 pages.
 810 pages / 664 days = 1.25 pages per day. So, Frank read approximately 1.25 pages per day.
 $$ \frac {120}{6} = 20 $$ dollars per DVD.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much one package of DVD costs. If each package costs $81, then the cost of one package is $81. Next, we need to find out how many packages are in 33 bundles. Since there are 33 bundles, and each bundle contains 5 packages, then the total number of packages is 33 x 5 = 165 packages. Therefore, the total cost of 33 bundles of DVDs is 165 x $81 = $12,775.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The problem states that there is a $106 discount for each DVD packaging box. So, if we want to know how many boxes we can buy with $93, we need to subtract $106 from $93. $93 - $106 = -$13 Therefore, we cannot buy any DVD packaging boxes with $93.
 New price = Original price x Discount = $76 x $25 = $1850 So, after applying the discount, you would pay $1850 for each DVD case.
 104 cents / $26 = 4 CDs. So, you can buy 4 DVDs with $104.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much one DVD costs. Let's assume the cost of one DVD is $14. Now, let's calculate how many dollars are in $28. There are 28 dollars in $28. So, if we buy two packages of DVDs, each package will cost $14 x 2 = $28. Therefore, there is no answer.
 306 / 2 = 153 groups. So, there are 153 groups of 2 pineapples each in Philip's collection.
 13 x 140 = 1860 bananas.
 266 / 7 = 38 bananas and 266 / 95 = 2.77 oranges per group. So, each group of bananas will have 38 bananas and each group of oranges will have 2.77 oranges.
 63,048 / 178 = 356 groups So, each group of oranges has 356 oranges.

According to the problem, she has prepared 38 pieces of bread, and each piece has 19 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices of bread that the mother has prepared is 38 x 19 = 702 slices. Now, we need to find out how many guests the mother has invited. We are told that each slice of bread represents a guest. So, if there are 702 slices of bread, then there must be 702 / 19 = 36 guests who have been invited to eat with the mother.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我们知道布伦达的妈妈为客人做了饼干。这意味着她准备了饼干给客人。secondly，we know that each guest ate two pieces of bread. This means that the total number of pieces of bread eaten by all guests is twice the number of guests. Finally, we are told that the mother prepared 10 pieces of bread in total. Therefore, if there were x guests, then the number of pieces of bread she prepared for them is 10 / 2 = 5. So, there were 5 guests.
 Make sure you don't forget to count the remaining candies that are left over after dividing them into equal groups. In this case, since we have 42 candies and want to divide them into 2 bags, we will have 21 candies in one bag and 21 + 4 = 25 candies left over. That means each bag will have 21 candies, and there will be 25 candies left over. Therefore, the answer is 21 candies per bag.
 How many pieces of candy can each bag hold? Each bag can hold 33 pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces of candy that Frank can put in his bags is 26 x 33 = 840 pieces of candy. Therefore, Frank will have 840 pieces of candy in total.
 Number of bags = Total number of candies / Number of candies in each bag = 33 / 9 = 4 bags So, Frank will have 4 bags.

Next, we need to consider whether the visitors are all new people or some of them have already visited before. If they are all new people, then we can calculate their number. However, if some of them have already visited before, then we cannot calculate their number. Therefore, let's think about this problem more carefully.

Let's assume that there were 317 new visitors today and 295 new visitors yesterday. Then, the total number of visitors today is 317 + 295 = 612. So, the difference between the number of visitors today and yesterday is 612 - 295 = 317.

Since there were 829 people who visited the palace in total, and since there were 45 visitors per day on weekends, the number of visitors per day on weekdays must be (829 - 45 x) / x = 17.63 visitors per day. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many white T-shirts are in one package. We know that the answer is 53. So, if Mom buys 57 packages, she will have 57 x 53 = 3097 white T-shirts! But wait, there's more! Since Mom also bought 34 pairs of pants, each pair has two pants, so she has a total of 34 x 2 = 68 pants. That means Mom has a total of 3097 + 68 = 3165 clothes!
 51 / 3 = 17 packages Now, let's check if this answer is correct. If she buys 17 packages, and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then she will have a total of 17 x 3 = 51 white T-shirts. Yes, that's correct! She will buy 17 packages of white T-shirts, and each package will contain 3 shirts, so she will have a total of 51 white T-shirts.

 28块饼干 = 28 x 1 = 28 So, there are 28 bags of cookies and 86 pieces of candy in total. Since each bag has the same number of cookies, we can conclude that there is only one bag of cookies. Therefore, there is no answer to the question.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many mailboxes the postman needs to deliver the trash letters to. Let's assume that each street has a certain number of houses, and each house has one mailbox. Therefore, the total number of mailboxes on a street is equal to the number of houses on that street. Now, let's think about how many streets there are in total. If the postman needs to give 5 trash letters to each street, then he needs to give a total of 5 x number of streets = 5 x n trash letters. Since each street has a certain number of houses, and each house has one mailbox, the total number of mailboxes on all streets together is equal to the product of the number of streets and the number of houses per street. Therefore, the total number of mailboxes is equal to 5n. So, if the postman gives 25 trash letters to each house, then he needs to give a total of 25 x 5n = 125n trash letters altogether. Finally, since each letter requires one envelope, the total number of envelopes needed is equal to the total number of trash letters divided by 5, which is 125n / 5 = n + 25. Therefore, there are n + 25 envelopes needed in total.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that the postman delivers 14 pieces of trash mail to each household in a street. Since there are n households in the street, the total number of pieces of trash mail delivered by the postman is 14n.  Now, we are asked how many households there are in the street. We can assume that the postman delivers 2 pieces of trash mail to each of the two households in the first street, since there are only two households in the first street. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash mail delivered by the postman to the first street is 2 x 2 = 4.  Similarly, the postman delivers 2 pieces of trash mail to each of the three households in the second street, so the total number of pieces of trash mail delivered to the second street is 3 x 2 = 6.  Continuing this pattern, the postman delivers 2 pieces of trash mail to each of the n-1 households in the (n-1)th street, for a total of 2 x (n-1) = n-2 pieces of trash mail.  Finally, the postman delivers 14n pieces of trash mail to the last street, which has n households. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash mail delivered by the postman is 14n + (n-2) = 14n + 2n = 16n.  So, there are 16n households in the street.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  street has 20 houses, and each house needs to receive 32 pieces of trash mail. So the total number of pieces of trash mail needed for the entire street is 20 x 32 = 640 pieces. Therefore, the answer is 640 pieces.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  street area has 78 mailboxes and each mailbox needs to receive 30 pieces of trash mail. If a neighborhood has 19 households, how many pieces of trash mail should the postal worker give to each household?  To find out, we need to divide 30 by 19. So, each household will receive 1.56 pieces of trash mail.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  street number of houses per district = 16 houses/district x total number of districts = 16 x 5 = 80 houses in total  Now, the mailman needs to deliver 4 pieces of trash mail to each house, so...
  Number of groups = Total number of objects / Number per group = 10 + 20 = 30 / 4 = 7 groups So there will be 7 groups of 4 marbles each.
 10 marbles. How many groups of 5 can we make with these numbers? We can make 2 groups of 5 using all the eggs and 3 groups of 5 using all the marbles. But we cannot make any group of 5 using both eggs and marbles together. So, there are no groups of 5 that Rebecca can create.
 30 / 11 = 2 (groups) So, Rebecca can make 2 groups of 11 eggs each. Therefore, she has a total of 2 x 11 = 22 eggs.
 8 eggs / 4 eggs/group = 2 groups. So, Rebecca can make 2 groups of 4 eggs each.
 4 marbles x 3 eggs/marble = 12 eggs. So, Rebecca can make 12 groups of 3 eggs each.
 Eggs (Group 1) + Bananas (72) + Marbles (66) = 138 objects Yes, we can create one combination using all of these objects! So, there is only one combination possible.
 9 x 3 = 27 marbles. Since each group of eggs can have at most 3 marbles, we can create at most 9 x 3 = 27 groups of marbles. Therefore, there are 27 groups in total.
 6 marbles. Since Rebecca has more eggs than marbles, we can conclude that she has more than 6 eggs left after giving some to her friends. In fact, since she has 20 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 5, she will have 4 groups of 5 eggs each, which is equal to 20 eggs / 5 = 4 groups. So, Rebecca has 4 groups of eggs left after giving some to her friends.
 5 marbles. Since Rebecca has more marbles than eggs, that means she has more than 12 eggs. In fact, she has 13 eggs left after giving 5 marbles to each group of 20 people. So, the answer is none.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Emily has 2 beads and she can make 32 chains. To find out how many beads each chain needs, we need to divide the number of chains by the number of beads. So, if we divide 32 by 2, we get 16. That means each chain needs 16 beads!
" The problem states that Emily has ""many"" stones, but it doesn't provide any information about the total number of stones she has. Therefore, we cannot use this information to find the answer. So, the correct answer is ""None""."
 16 beads. Now, let's think about how many necklaces she can make with these beads. Each necklace needs 8 beads, so...
 6 beads / 18 chain links = 0.33 bead per link So, each chain link will use approximately 0.33 beads.
" n - 20 = ? So, the answer is ""none"" because Emily doesn't have any beads left after making the four chains."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 艾米莉有6颗珠子，每条 item chain needs 3 beads. So the total number of beads she has is 6 x 3 = 18 beads. Since each friend wants a necklace with 72 beads, and there are only 18 beads available, Emily can make at most 72 / 18 = 4 necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 4.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that Emily has 5 pearls and she can make 20 chains. So, the number of chains she can make is equal to the number of pearls she has divided by the number of chains she can make. In this case, the number of chains she can make is 5 ÷ 20 = 0.25 chains. Since we cannot have a fraction of a chain, Emily can make at most 0 chains. Therefore, the answer is zero.

How many strings are needed for each bracelet? Each bracelet requires 2 strings. Therefore, the total number of strings needed is 44 x 2 = 88 strings. Now, how many beads do we need in total? Since each string requires 2 beads, the total number of beads needed is 88 strings x 2 beads/string = 176 beads. So, Emily has 176 beads in total.
 819058 = 0.8 or 80%. This means that 80% of the children in Lawrence County stayed at home during the summer vacation, while 20% (or 819058 / 668278) went to the summer camp. Therefore, there were 819058 - 668278 = 150770 more children who stayed at home than went to the summer camp.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many children are staying at home during the summer vacation. According to the problem, 274865 children are staying at home. Now, let's think about how many children went to camp. Since the problem states that there are 313473 children in total, and only 274865 children are staying at home, it means that 38508 children went to camp. Therefore, the answer is 38508.
 907611 - 455682 = 451930 children who stayed at home. Therefore, there are approximately 451930 children in the county who did not go to summer camp.
 828,521 x 0.99 = 817,347 Therefore, approximately 817,347 children stayed at home during the summer vacation.
 Percentage = (Number of children who went to summer camp / Total number of people) x 100% Number of children who went to summer camp = Total number of people - Number of children who stayed at home = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 So, approximately 30,000 children from LaRance County went to summer camp.
 34044 + 134867 + 424944 = 900055. So, there are 900055 children who attended summer camp.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 610769 children from Lauren County who went to summer camp during the summer vacation. Then, we are asked how many children stayed at home in Lauren County. We can assume that these children are the remaining 590796 children who did not go to summer camp. Finally, we are told that there were also 22 children from outside the county who attended summer camp. Therefore, the total number of children in Lauren County is 610769 + 590796 = 1201565 children.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many children are from Lauren County. The problem states that there are 644,997 children in total and 893,835 of them went to summer camp. This means that the number of children who stayed at home is 644,997 - 893,835 = 150,062. Since the problem also states that 78 children came from outside the county, the total number of children in Lauren County is 150,062 + 78 = 150,140. Therefore, there are 150,140 children in Lauren County.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Let's think step by step. According to the problem, Adam and Jack together have 6 apples. If there are more than 4 apples between them, then they must have 6 - 4 = 2 apples each. So, Adam has 2 apples and Jack has 2 apples. Therefore, the answer is 0 apples.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Adam and Jack together have 9 apples. Then, we are told that Adam and Jack have 7 apples in total. So, the difference between the number of apples they have together and the total number of apples they have is 2 (9 - 7 = 2). Therefore, there are 2 extra apples left over after Adam and Jack shared them equally among themselves.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we can see that Adam and Jack have a total of 12 apples together. Then, we know that 9 more apples are shared between them, which means they have a total of 21 apples (12 + 9). Now, we are told that Adam has 8 more apples than Jack, so the number of apples Adam has is 21 - 8 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 apples in total.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that Adam has 4 apples and Jack has 10 apples. So together they have 14 apples. Now, we are asked how many apples Adam has. But the problem states that Adam and Jack together have 6 more apples than Adam alone. Therefore, if Adam has x apples, then the total number of apples they both have is x + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20 apples. So Adam has 20 - 4 = 16 apples.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 亞得比杰基多5个蘋果，意味著亞得有5+X的蘋果，其中X是杰基的蘋果數量。因此，亞得有5+X=66的蘋果。而杰基有89个橙子和11个蘋果， Totally 100 fruit. So the answer is 66.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how much weight Jessie lost each day after she started running. According to the problem, she lost 20 kg per day. Now, let's calculate her current weight. After losing 20 kg per day for x days, her total weight loss is 20x kg. Since she started running, her weight has decreased by a total of 20x kg. So, her current weight is 71 - 20x kg. To find out her current weight, we need to solve for x. Can you help me solve this equation?
 Starting weight = Current weight - Total weight lost = 27 kg - 9,100 kg = 8,973 kg Therefore, Jessie's starting weight was approximately 8,973 kg.
 Jessie's pre-running weight was 60 kg.
 69 kg - 2100 kg = 421 kg Jesse's current weight is 421 kg.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First week, she lost 50 kg, so her weight after one week is 114 - 50 = 64 kg. Second week, she lost 60 kg, so her weight after two weeks is 64 - 60 = 44 kg. Therefore, her current weight is 44 kg.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First week, she lost 62 kg, so her weight after first week is 9 - 62 = 33 kg. Second week, she lost 140 kg, so her weight after second week is 33 - 140 = -107 kg. Since the weight cannot be negative, we know that her weight before starting to run must be greater than or equal to 107 kg. Therefore, there is no answer.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First week, she lost 56 kg, so her weight after the first week is 92 - 56 = 36 kg. Second week, she lost 99 kg, so her weight after the second week is 36 + (99 - 56) = 71 kg. Therefore, her weight after two weeks of running is 71 kg.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 95 snakes in the box. If 64 of them hide, then the number of snakes left unhidden is 95 - 64 = 31. So, there are 31 snakes that haven't hidden themselves.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 93 snakes and 97 fish in the tank. If 40 fish hide themselves, then the number of fish that did not hide themselves is 97 - 40 = 57. Therefore, there are 57 fish that have not hidden themselves.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we need to find out how many snakes are hiding in the box. According to the problem, there are 82 snakes hiding in the box. Now, let's count the number of fish that are not hidden. According to the problem, there are 75 fish in the tank. Since there are more fish than snakes, some fish must be hidden. Therefore, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Firstly, we know that there are 24 snakes and 51 fish in the box. So, the total number of animals in the box is 24 + 51 = 75. Now, we are asked how many animals are not hiding. Since all the snakes and fish are hiding, the answer must be 0. Therefore, there are no animals that are not hiding.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. How many tomatoes did the farmer have yesterday? According to the problem, he had 171 tomatoes yesterday. Now, how many tomatoes did he pick yesterday? The problem says he picked 134 tomatoes yesterday. So, the number of tomatoes he had left after picking is 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes. Now, how many tomatoes did he pick today? The problem says he picked 30 tomatoes today. So, the number of tomatoes he has left after picking both days is 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes. Therefore, there are 67 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden at the end of the day.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 昨天摘了56个，今天摘了41个，那麼昨天剩下多少个？ 可以看到，昨天剩下的是56-41=15个。所以，昨天剩下的番茄是15个。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 如果他昨天摘了154个，那么现在他已經摘了154+50=204个番茄。因此，他总共摘了204个番茄。
 77 And so, the answer is zero - the farmer did not pick any tomatoes or potatoes.
 177 - 53 = 124 Therefore, the farmer still has 124 tomatoes in his garden.
 176 - 137 = 39 tomatoes left in his garden. So, there are 39 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden after he picked 137 tomatoes.
 Number of nails needed = 4 (since there are 4 boards) x Number of boards per nail = 2 ( since each nail is used for 2 boards) Total number of boards needed = Number of nails / Number of boards per nail = 4 / 2 = 2 So, John needs to buy 2 boards to build a wall with these boards.
 201 + (8 x ?) = ? nails. So, John needs a total of ? nails to build the wall.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  John needs to use a total of 11 nails to fix the wall panels. If each panel requires 3 nails, then he will need 3 x 5 = 15 nails for all five panels. However, there are additional 8 nails used in the problem statement, which means that John has used a total of 11 - 8 = 3 extra nails. Therefore, John needs to build 3 / 3 = 1 panel.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's think step by step. We know that John needs 12 big wood planks and 10 small wood planks to build the wall of his house. Each big wood plank requires 15 nails to fix it, and each small wood plank requires 5 nails. So, in total, John needs... (wait for it) ...0 nails! That's right, because we don't need any nails at all! The big wood planks are already fixed together with the smaller ones, so no additional nails are needed. Therefore, the answer is zero.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，约翰需要使用的钉子數量是多少？ 每块 wood panel needs 2 nails to fix it, so John needs 16 x 2 = 32 nails in total.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many nails are needed for one wall. Since each wood plank needs 74 nails, and John wants to use 8 wood planks for the wall, he will need a total of 74 x 8 = 576 nails. Now, let's calculate how many wood planks John will need to buy. If each wood plank costs $10, then John will need to spend $10 x 8 = $80 on wood planks. So, John will need at least 576 - 80 = 496 wood planks to build the wall. However, since there may be some waste or irregularities in the cutting process, it is possible that John will actually need more than 496 wood planks. Therefore, as a rough estimate, John may need around 500-550 wood planks to build the wall.
" 12 x 14 = 168 nails for big wood planks 17 x 25 = 425 nails for small wood planks In total, John needs 593 nails to build the wall of his house. Since there are 593 nails in total, but only 400 nails provided, it means that John cannot build the entire wall with the given materials. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many packages there are in total. We know that each package contains 3 pieces of candy, and the total number of pieces of candy is 42. So, if we divide 42 by 3, we get 14 packages. Therefore, there are 14 packages in total.

 41 / 7 = 6 packages. Therefore, Robin has 6 packages of candy.
 52 pieces / 1 type = 52 pieces of candy canes So, Robin has 56 pieces of gumdrops and 52 pieces of candy canes.
 45 bags x 9 pieces/bag = 375 pieces of candy. So, Robin has a total of 375 pieces of candy.
 28 bags of sugar cubes and 14 bags of gummies. Each bag has 6 pieces, so...
 6 x 0.33 = 2.08 minutes (or 126 seconds) Therefore, the answer is 2 minutes and 8 seconds.
 Total number of shirts = Number of minutes x Number of shirts per minute Total number of shirts = 5 x 4 = 20 shirts. Therefore, the answer is 20 shirts.
 x + 12 = 108 minutes (since it worked for 108 minutes in total).

We are told that they earned $420 in total during the 30-day period, and since there were 30 days, each day they earned $13.67 ($420 / 30). Now, let's add the amount of money they earned from other games to find out how much they earned from the puzzle game specifically. The problem states that they earned $22 in total from other games, so each day they earned $0.73 ($22 / 30). Therefore, the person earned $13.67 per day from playing the puzzle game and $0.73 per day from other games, for a total of $14.40 per day.

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, let's calculate the total amount of money earned during the entire festival. According to the problem, the total amount of money earned is $186 ($120 + $66). Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of days left in the festival. How many days are left in the festival? According to the problem, there are 16 days left in the festival after the first 20 days. So, we can divide $186 by 16 days to get the average daily earnings. What is the average daily earnings? To find out, we can multiply the total amount of money earned by 16 and then divide it by 20. This gives us an average daily earning of $14 ($186 / 16 = $14 x 20 = $280). Therefore, the answer is $280.
 $439 / 57 = $8.06 per day So, the person earned $8.06 per day on average during the remaining 57 days.

So, if they continue traveling in the same direction, they will reach the bottom of the hole after an additional 408 feet (919 - 511 = 408). Therefore, the distance from their current location to the end of the tunnel is 1307 + 408 = 1715 feet.
 849 / 17 = 50 hours to reach the end of the cave. So, there is still 50 - 849 = -740 feet left to go before they reach the end of the cave.
" Depth = 762 ft - 0 ft (since they are already at the deepest part of the cave) = 762 ft Since they are already at the deepest part of the cave and the cave is straight down, there is no further distance they can travel until they reach the bottom of the cave. Therefore, the answer is ""No""."

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Goldie has 7 fish and 12 cats in her pond. Each cat eats 3 fish. How many fish are left?  First, we need to find out how many fish each cat can eat. We know that each cat can eat 3 fish, so the total number of fish that each cat can eat is 12 x 3 = 36 fish. Now, let's see how many fish are left after the cats have eaten them all. If 7 fish were initially present, and each cat ate 3 fish, then there will be 7 - 3 = 4 fish left. So, there are 4 fish left in the pond.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Goldfish have 50% chance of surviving and 50% chance of dying each year. So the number of goldfish that will disappear in one year is 50%. Since Poochi has 16 goldfish initially, we can calculate the probability of all of them surviving for one year as (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 or 50%. Therefore, there is a 50% chance that none of the goldfish will disappear in one year. Now let's consider the case where Poochi has only two goldfish left after one year. The probability of this happening is (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.375 or 37.5%. This means that there is a 37.5% chance that at least one goldfish will disappear in one year, leaving Poochi with only two goldfish remaining.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  Goldfish are small fish that live in a bowl or tank and are often kept as pets. They have been bred to be colorful and interesting to look at, but they can also be quite tasty for cats! In this problem, we need to find out how many goldfish are left after the cat has eaten 5 of them. Let's start by using our reasoning skills to solve this puzzle.  First, let's think about how many goldfish were originally in the bowl. According to the problem, there were 15 goldfish in the bowl. So, if 5 of them were eaten by the cat, then there are now fewer goldfish in the bowl than there were initially. How many fewer? Well, if you subtract 5 from 15, you get 10. That means there are 10 goldfish left in the bowl after the cat ate 5 of them. Great job! You just used your reasoning skills to solve the problem. Now it's time to check your answer. Do you agree with the number of goldfish I came up with? If not, please explain why.

Let's see... if he used x apples to make the dumplings, then he has 43 - x apples left. So, we need to find out how many apples he used to make the dumplings. But the problem says that there are only 2 apples left! That means he must have used all 43 apples to make the dumplings, so he didn't use any apples at all! Therefore, the answer is zero (0).

沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 亚当的房間可以容納8個動作人物，這8個動作人物可以在10個架子上進行，因此需要10/8=1.25個架子。所以亚当的房間有1.25個总架子。
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 亚当的房間可以放8个動作人物，每個架子上有10個承接櫃子。因此，亚登的架子总共可以放8 x 10 = 80個物品。然而，問題提到了「他的架子总共可以放多少个物品」，這意味著亚登的房間可以放的物品數量不是 fixed 的80個，而是可以根據需要更改的。因此，答案是：沒有。
 544 x 32 = 17,688 flowers. Therefore, there are 17,688 flowers in total.
 181 x 466 = 87,666 sticks. Therefore, there are 24,098 flowers and 87,666 sticks.
  Total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers per pot = 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. So, there are 9671 flowers in total.
 160 flowers + 160 flowers + ... + 160 flowers (repeated 3 times) = 640 flowers So, there are 640 flower pots in total!

According to the problem, he has 4276 rubber wipes. If he divides them into 154 groups, then each group needs to have how many rubber wipes? We can divide 4276 by 154 and get 28. Therefore, each group needs 28 rubber wipes. So, there are 30 x 28 = 840 items in total.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考. 首先，我們知道史蒂文有3941顆彩虹糖。如果他分成495组，每组要有多少彩虹糖？ 495 x 3941 = 178625 顆彩虹糖！！！！ 因此，史蒂文的橡皮擦不能被分成495组。
 379 - 90 = 289 sweets (from Group 2) ... and so on until all the sweets are used up. So, there are a total of 8 groups of sweets. Therefore, each group contains 1403 / 8 = 175 sweets.
 270 / 5 = 54 classes. So, there are 54 classes in this school.
沒有  我們先來一步一步思考.  First, we need to find out how many classes there are in the school. According to the problem, each class has 75 students, so there are 75/1 = 75 classes in total. Next, we need to find out how many students are in all of these classes together. Since there are 304 grades, and each grade has 75 students, the total number of students is 304 x 75 = 22,800 students. Therefore, there are 22,800 students in this school.
