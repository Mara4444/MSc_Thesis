"Response: 45
Explanation:
Let's assume that there are x red cherries and y green cherries in the basket. Since there are more than 3 red cherries, we know that x > 3. Also, since there are at least 10 more green cherries than red cherries, we can write y = x + 10. Now, we have two equations: x > 3 and y = x + 10. Solving for x, we get x = 45. Therefore, there are 45 green cherries in the basket."

"Response: 10 - 2 = 8
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel has 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. Additionally, she has 96 pages of biology homework, which is more than the number of pages of her reading homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading homework is 96 - 2 = 8 pages."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Rachel has 11 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework, and additional biology homework that is 3 pages longer than her math homework. Therefore, if we assume that the length of each page of math homework is equal to the length of each page of reading homework (i.e., both are measured in pages), then we can calculate the number of pages of math homework as follows: Number of pages of math homework = Total number of pages of homework / Number of pages of reading homework x Length of each page of math homework Where total number of pages of homework is given by 11 + 2 = 13 pages, and length of each page of math homework is assumed to be equal to the length of each page of reading homework, which is also given by 2 pages. Substituting these values into the formula above, we get: Number of pages of math homework = 13 / 2 x 2 = 6 pages So, according to the question, Rachel has 6 pages of math homework more than her reading homework.

Explanation: According to the passage, Bat jumped 19 inches and was farther away from Kangaroo than Kangaroo was from Mouse. Therefore, if Kangaroo jumped x inches, then Bat would have jumped x + 19 inches. Since Mouse jumped 44 inches less than Kangaroo, we can deduce that Kangaroo jumped 63 inches (44 - 20 = 63)."
"Response: 45 inches
Explanation: According to the passage, Bat jumped 39 inches and is farther away from Kangaroo than Kangaroo is from Mouse. Therefore, Mouse jumped 45 inches (39 + 16 = 45)."
"Response: 37 inches
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The kangaroo jumped 21 inches.
* The frog jumped 19 inches less than the kangaroo (i.e., 21 - 19 = 2).
* The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog (i.e., 2 - 16 = -14).

Now, let's find out how far the kangaroo jumped from the mouse:

Kangaroo jumped 21 inches more than the mouse (i.e., 21 + (-14) = 37).

Therefore, the answer is 37 inches."
"Response: 22 inches
Explanation:
The distance that Kael jumped is given as 39 inches. The distance that Batta jumped is given as 17 inches. To find out how far Kael jumped beyond Batta, we need to subtract the distance Batta jumped from the distance Kael jumped. So, the answer is 22 inches (39 - 17 = 22)."
"Response: 20 inches
Explanation: According to the passage, Nezumi jumped 3 inches less than Batta, and Caer jumped 33 inches further than Batta. Therefore, Nezumi jumped 20 inches (3 - 9 = 20)."
"Response: 50 inches
Explanation: According to the question, the distance between the mouse and the frog is 37 inches more than the distance between the frog and the snake. Since the snake jumped 14 inches, the distance between the snake and the mouse is 37 + 14 = 51 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 50 inches (51 - 14)."

Explanation: According to the question, Mary needs 13 cups of sugar for her recipe, and she has already added 2 cups. Therefore, she still needs 11 cups (13 - 2 = 11) of sugar."
"Response: 5 cups
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and needs to add more flour than that. Since 1 cup of flour is required for every 2 cups of sugar, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour (since she has already added 4 cups of sugar). Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is 9 - 4 = 5 cups."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 2 cups of flour and needs 6 more cups for the recipe. Therefore, she needs an additional 4 cups of flour (6 - 2 = 4)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the recipe, Mary needs to add 7 cups of sugar (5 cups + 2 cups) since she has already used 11 cups of flour."

"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 19 bird families that live near the mountain. In winter, an additional 60 bird families fly away from their homes in the mountain. Therefore, the total number of bird families that flew away is 60 - 19 = 41. So, 41 bird families flew away more than the original 19 families."
"Response: 19
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 7 of them fly away during winter, then the number of remaining bird families would be:
87 - 7 = 80
So, there are 80 bird families left in the area."
"Response: 30

"Response: 15
Explanation:
If 23 birds from the family of 85 birds migrate to Africa and 37 birds migrate to Asia, then the number of bird families remaining in the mountain area is:
1 - (23 + 37) = 15
Therefore, there are 15 bird families left in the mountain area after some birds have migrated away."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the passage, 42 birds from Africa flew to Asia and 31 birds from Africa flew to Asia. Therefore, there are 42 - 31 = 9 more bird families that flew to Africa than to Asia."
"Response: 56
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 94 bird families that flew from Asia to Africa, and 47 bird families that flew from Africa to Asia. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that flew from Asia to Africa and the number of bird families that flew from Africa to Asia is 94 - 47 = 56."

Response: 105 (87 + 18)
Response: 73 (49 + 24)
"Response: 36 families
Explanation:
The total number of bird families that migrated to warm countries is given as 27. Since there were initially 41 families living near the mountain, this means that 27 - 41 = -8 families did not migrate. Therefore, there are 36 families left behind in the mountain area."
"Response: 41
Explanation: According to the passage, there were originally 45 bird families in the area near the mountain. Of these, 86 bird families flew away for winter, leaving only 45 - 86 = 41 bird families behind. Therefore, there are 41 more bird families that left than remained in the area."
"Response: 10
Explanation: If 35 birds from the mountainous area flew to Asia and 62 birds flew to Africa, then there are 10 more birds in Africa than in Asia."
Response: 10 pairs of bird families remain near the mountain. Explanation: According to the question, 3 bird families already live near the mountain.

Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 110 boxes of crayons for his birthday and gave away 90 boxes to his friends. This means he has 210 boxes of crayons left (110 - 90 = 210). However, the question states that he lost 412 boxes of crayons, which is more than the number of boxes he gave away. Therefore, the difference between the number of boxes he had after giving them away and the number he lost is 312 (412 - 210 = 312)."
"Response: 104
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 563 boxes of crayons and lost 558 boxes. Therefore, he has 332 boxes left, which is equal to 104 boxes if we assume each box contains 3 crayons (as there are 3 numbers in the problem)."
"Response: 535 - 492 = 43
Explanation: If Paul gave away 52 boxes of crayons and lost 535 boxes, then he has 492 boxes left."
"Response: 307
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paul received 521 boxes of crayons and 66 boxes of erasers. (So far, so good.)
* At the end of the school year, he had 154 erasers left. (This is the part we need to work with.)

Now, let's calculate the number of erasers that Paul lost or gave away during the school year:

Total number of erasers = 66 + (521 - 154) = 307

Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 307 erasers during the school year."
"Response: 240
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 38 pieces of erasers and 531 pieces of pencils. By the end of the school year, he had 391 erasers left and no pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils Paul had at the start of the school year is 531 - 391 = 140."
"Response: 265
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 601 pieces of erasers and 406 pieces of rubbers at his birthday party. By the end of the school year, he had 336 pieces of rubbers left, which means he lost 79 pieces (406 - 336 = 79). Since he received more erasers than rubbers, he must have had more than 336 erasers left by the end of the school year. Therefore, the number of erasers he had left is 265 (601 - 336 = 265)."
"Response: 315 - 291 = 24
So Paul received 24 boxes of crayons on his birthday."
"Response: 94
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 267 crayons for his birthday and lost 231 of them during the school year. This means he had 36 (267 - 231) crayons left. He then gave away 308 crayons to his friends, which is more than the number he had left. Therefore, the difference between the number of crayons he gave away and the number he had left is 308 - 36 = 94."
Response:  Paul received 457 erasers and 320 crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he had 523 erasers left without losing any. Therefore, he had 93 more crayons than erasers.
"Response: 4 people
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 11 customers in the restaurant. After some of them left, 3 customers remained. Therefore, the number of customers who left the restaurant is equal to the number of remaining customers minus the number of remaining customers plus 3 (since 3 customers remained). This can be expressed mathematically as: Number of customers who left = Number of remaining customers - Number of remaining customers + 3. In this case, the number of customers who left is 8 (since there are 8 fewer customers than the initial total of 11), and therefore the number of customers who left is 8."

Explanation: According to the question, Nelly had 242 baseball cards and gave 136 of them to Jeff. Therefore, she has 106 baseball cards left with her."
"Response: 257
Explanation: According to the question, Nelly had 301 cards initially and gave 301 - 154 = 257 cards to Jeff. Therefore, she had 257 cards initially."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Nelly collected 528 baseball cards before giving some of them to Jeff. If she gave him 11 cards, then she had 517 cards left (528 - 11 = 517). Now, since Jeff has 11 cards and he gave some of them back to Nelly, there are 406 cards left with Jeff (406 = 517 - 11). Therefore, Nelly gave Jeff 30 cards (406 - 11 = 395)."
"Response: 211
Explanation: According to the passage, Nel had 566 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. After giving those cards away, she now has 535 cards. Since Jeff started with 234 cards and received some from Nel, he now has 211 cards."
"Response: 247
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Nelly has 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-yen cards. (Total = 665)
* She gives some of her cards to Jeff. (Assuming she gave him at least 10 cards, as that is the minimum number of cards she has.)
* After giving cards to Jeff, Nelly has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-yen cards left. (Total = 564)

Now, let's calculate the difference between the total number of cards Nelly had initially and the total number of cards she has left after giving some to Jeff:

Initial Total - Final Total = 665 - 564 = 101

So, there are 101 more baseball cards than ten-yen cards left with Nelly after giving some to Jeff."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the question, Nel has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-yen coins. To find out how many more ten-yen coins she has than baseball cards, we subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of coins: 495 - 404 = 91. Therefore, Nel has 91 more ten-yen coins than baseball cards."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Nelly gave Jeff 195 cards and she had 573 cards in total. So, after giving Jeff cards, she has 573 - 195 = 378 cards left. Then, she gives some more cards to John, so now she has 378 - x = 210 cards left, where x is the number of cards she gave to John. Therefore, the answer is 40 (x)."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the question, Nel has 10 cards of type X and 438 cards of type Y. She gives some of these cards to Jeff, who now has 55 cards of type X and 178 cards of type Y. Therefore, Nel has 26 more cards of type Y than she had initially (178 - 10 = 168)."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the question, Nel has 10 cards that she gave to Jeff, and now she has 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nel has than the number of cards she gave to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave him from her original total. So, the difference between her original total (111 + 10 = 121) and the number of cards she gave to Jeff (10) is 111 - 10 = 101. Therefore, Nel has 101 more baseball cards than the number of cards she gave to Jeff."

The total number of children who boarded the bus is 22 + 40 = 62. Since some children got off the bus, the remaining number of children on the bus is 62 - 2 = 60. Therefore, 36 children got off the bus at the stop."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initial number of children on the bus = 28
* Number of children who got off at the bus stop = 82 - 28 = 54
* Final number of children on the bus = 30

Now, let's calculate the difference between the initial and final numbers of children:
Final number of children - Initial number of children = 30 - 28 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 more children on the bus after it stopped compared to when it started."

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Randi had 40 blocks initially. He used 52 blocks to build the tower and has 38 blocks left. Therefore, he started with 40 blocks."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Randi has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. After building the tower, 72 blocks are left. To find out how many blocks Randi used to build the tower, we can divide the number of blocks left (72) by the total number of blocks Randi had (97). This gives us 35 as the number of blocks Randi used to build the tower."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
Randy has 79 blocks and he used 14 of them to build a tower. So, he has 65 blocks left (79 - 14 = 65). Then, he used 11 blocks to build a house. So, he has 56 blocks left (65 - 11 = 56)."
"Response: 85
Explanation:
Randy has 58 blocks and uses 27 of them to build a tower. This means he has 31 blocks left (58 - 27 = 31). He then uses 53 of these blocks to build a house, leaving him with 0 blocks remaining (31 - 53 = 0). Therefore, Randy used a total of 85 blocks (31 + 53 = 85) to build both the tower and the house."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Randi has 37 blocks and uses 33 of them to build a tower. This means he has 4 blocks left over (37 - 33 = 4)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Randi has 86 blocks and uses 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. To determine how many blocks Randi used to build the house compared to building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks Randi has. Therefore, Randi used 86 - 79 = 3 blocks more to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response: 13
Explanation: If Randi has 36 blocks to build a tower and he uses all of them, then he will have 0 remaining blocks. If he had 59 blocks in total, that means he used 23 blocks (59 - 36 = 23). Therefore, there are 13 blocks left over."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Randi used 20 blocks to build his house and 50 blocks to build his tower. Therefore, he used a total of 70 blocks (20 + 50). Since he had 95 blocks in total, he used 25 blocks more than he had (95 - 70 = 25)."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Randi has 90 blocks and uses 89 of them to build a house. This means he has 1 block left over. To build a tower, he uses 63 blocks, which is less than the number of blocks he had left over (1 block). Therefore, Randi used 14 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."

"Response: 9
Explanation:
If there were initially 3 trees that survived the typhoon and 10 trees that died, then the total number of trees is 3 + 10 = 13. Therefore, if 13 trees were in the backyard before the typhoon, and 3 survived, then the number of trees that died in the typhoon is 13 - 3 = 10."
"Response: 7
Explanation:
Healey's backyard had 11 trees before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 2 trees remained alive. So, the number of surviving trees is 2/11 = 0.18 or 18%. Therefore, there are 7 trees that survived the typhoon (11 - 2 = 7)."
Response:  He harvested 66 baskets of oranges that day. Since each basket contains 28 oranges, he harvested 66 x 28 = 1804 oranges that day.
Response: 3 days 
"Response:  If he harvested 56 oranges in total over 4 days, and each day he harvested an average of x oranges, then the number of oranges he harvested per day is:

$$ \boxed{x = \frac{56}{4}} $$

So, he harvested approximately 14 oranges per day."
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the question, in 49 days, the person harvested 38 baskets of oranges per day, and each basket contains 42 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested is 38 x 42 = 1672. Since there are 49 days in total, the person would have harvested 1672 / 49 = 34 oranges per day."
"Response: 3405
Explanation:
The orange grove produces 66 baskets per day, and each basket contains 25 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges produced in one day is:
66 x 25 = 1650
Since the harvest lasts for 87 days, the total number of oranges collected is:
1650 x 87 = 140,500
So, after 87 days of harvesting, they would have collected 140,500 oranges."
Response:  He harvested 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
"Response: 2 days
Explanation: According to the question, if each bag contains 57 oranges and there are 80 bags in total, it will take 2 days to collect all 80 bags of oranges, as each bag takes 1 day to collect (57 x 80 = 4480 oranges)."
Response: 490 oranges. Explanation: If he harvests 35 baskets of oranges and each basket contains 12 oranges, then he has harvested a total of 35 x 12 = 420 oranges. Since there are 67 oranges in each basket, the total number of oranges harvested is 420 / 67 = 640 oranges. Therefore, the answer is 640 oranges.
"Response: 390
Explanation:
The passage states that the man harvested 74 baskets of oranges in one day and threw away 71 baskets. This means he collected 3 baskets of oranges that were not thrown away. Since this process continued for 51 days, the total number of oranges collected is 3 x 51 = 153. However, since 71 baskets were thrown away each day, the final number of oranges held by the man is 153 - 71 = 82."
"Response: 3800 oranges
Explanation:
The passage states that the man harvested 76 baskets of oranges in one day and threw away 64 baskets. This means he collected 12 baskets of oranges (76 - 64 = 12).
Since each basket contains 50 oranges, the total number of oranges collected is 12 x 50 = 600 oranges.
Therefore, the man harvested 600 oranges per day."
Response:  He harvested 70 pouches of oranges after 26 days (28 + 52 = 70).
"Response: 
The number of bags of ripe oranges that they will have after 25 days is:
82 + (61 x 0.75) = 134 bags
Therefore, they will have 134 bags of ripe oranges after 25 days."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the passage, after 45 days of harvesting, the number of unripe oranges that will become ripe is 24."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, 44 pouches of ripe oranges were harvested in one day, and 25 pouches of unripe oranges were also harvested. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is 44 + 25 = 69. Since there are more ripe oranges than unripe ones, we can deduce that the number of ripe oranges harvested is 44, while the number of unripe oranges harvested is 25. So, the difference between the number of ripe and unripe oranges harvested is 44 - 25 = 19."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the passage, the man harvested 5 baskets of fully ripe oranges and 74 baskets of unripe oranges in one day. Since there are 12 baskets in a standard basket, we can calculate the total number of unripe oranges as follows: 74 baskets x 12 oranges per basket = 864 oranges. Therefore, the difference between the number of unripe oranges and fully ripe oranges is 864 - 5 = 859 oranges."
"Response: 3 days 
Explanation: If they harvested 54 baskets of oranges in total and they harvest 18 baskets per day, it will take them 3 days to harvest all the oranges."
Response:  If he harvested oranges for 14 days and collected a total of 56 bags, then he collected an average of 4 bags per day.
"Response: 40
Explanation:
The farmer harvested 25 baskets of unripe oranges per day and 5 baskets of ripe oranges per day for 73 days. Therefore, the total number of baskets of ripe oranges he harvested is:
25 x 73 = 1825 (unripe oranges) + 5 x 73 = 365 (ripe oranges) = 2190 baskets
So, the farmer has 2190 baskets of ripe oranges after 73 days of harvesting."
Response:  The number of bags of unripe oranges that will become ripe after 6 days is 79 bags (65 x 1.13 = 79).
"Response: 55
Explanation: According to the passage, the man harvested 41 baskets of unripe oranges and 86 baskets of ripe oranges in one day. To find out how many more baskets of ripe oranges were harvested than unripe oranges, we can subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges: 86 - 41 = 45. Therefore, there are 45 more baskets of ripe oranges harvested than unripe oranges."
"Response: 11
Explanation: According to the passage, the number of unripe oranges collected per day is 71, while the number of ripe oranges collected per day is 60. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 11 (71 - 60)."
"Response: 3 feet
Explanation: According to the question, Jessie's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, the difference between the length and width of the room is 12 - 11 = 3 feet."
Response:  The width of Jessie's room is 8 feet (7 ft x 1.1).
"Response: 5 feet
Explanation: According to the question, Jessie's room is 7 feet wide, and she needs a carpet that is 14 square feet in size. Since a square foot is equal to 12 inches, we can calculate the length of Jessie's room as follows:
Length = Area of Carpet / Width of Room
= 14 sq ft / 7 ft
= 2 feet
Therefore, the length of Jessie's room is 2 feet or 24 inches."
"Response: 24 square feet
Explanation:
The room is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet in size. Since there are already 16 square feet of carpet on the floor, we need an additional 89 square feet (165 - 16) to cover the entire floor. Therefore, Jessie needs 24 square feet of carpet more."
Response: 36 tiles are needed to cover Jessie's room.
"Response: 36 square feet
Explanation:
The room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, so its area is 19 x 18 = 342 square feet. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we need to cover all of their floors with carpet. Therefore, the total amount of carpet needed is 342 square feet / 20 rooms = 36 square feet per room."
Response: 3 feet (or any other appropriate unit of measurement). Explanation: According to the question, Jessie's room is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, if the room is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long, then it is 3 feet (or 36 inches) longer than it is wide.
"Response: 3 feet
Explanation:
From the question, we know that Jessie needs 10 square feet of carpet to cover her room. Since the length of the room is 5 feet, the width must be 3 feet (since 10 / 5 = 2)."
"Response: 5 feet
Explanation:
From the question, we know that Jessie needs 10 square feet of carpet to cover her room. Since the width of her room is 2 feet, the length of her room must be 5 feet (10 / 2 = 5)."
"Response: 36 square feet
Explanation:
The room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so its area is 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jessie has already bought 18 square feet of carpet, she still needs 80 - 18 = 62 square feet more to cover the entire floor. Therefore, Jessie needs 36 square feet of additional carpet."
Response:  The number of T-shirts sold by Razorbacks Back is 230/23 = 10.
"Response:  $51 / 3 = $17
Explanation: The shop sold 3 T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas game and earned $51 in total. Since each T-shirt costs $17, we can conclude that one T-shirt costs $17."
Response:  $87 x 47 = $3,999 
"Response: 137
Explanation:
If Razorback T-Shirt Shop sells $106 per T-shirt and sold a total of 242 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and Texas Tech game, then the total revenue generated by the shop is:

Total revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt
= 242 x $106
= $25,892

If the shop sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the number of T-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game can be calculated as follows:

Number of T-shirts sold during Texas Tech game = Total number of T-shirts sold - Number of T-shirts sold during Arkansas game
= 242 - 115
= 127

Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 137 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  $89 x 163 = $14,072 
"Response:  $104
Explanation:
If Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 172 t-shirts at Arkansas' game and made $78 per t-shirt, then they made a total of $1356 ($78 x 172) from that game alone.
In addition, they sold a total of 186 t-shirts across both games, so their total revenue for both games is $1356 + $104 = $1460."
"Response:  $450
Explanation:
The profit from selling t-shirts is given as $62 per shirt. If they sold 183 t-shirts, their total profit from t-shirts would be:
$62 x 183 = $11,786

Similarly, the profit from selling jeans is given as $99 per pair. If they sold 31 pairs of jeans, their total profit from jeans would be:
$99 x 31 = $3,099

Therefore, the total profit for both t-shirts and jeans combined is:
$11,786 + $3,099 = $450"
"Response:  $209,830
Explanation:
The profit from selling jerseys can be calculated as follows:
Jersey sales = 156 pieces x $165 per piece = $25,990
Profit from jersey sales = $25,990 - $100 (cost of each jersey) = $25,890
Therefore, the profit from selling jerseys is $25,890.
To find the total profit, we need to add the profit from jersey sales to the profit from t-shirt sales:
Total profit = Profit from t-shirt sales + Profit from jersey sales
= $74 x $67 = $4,898 + $25,890 = $29,788
So, the Razorbacks' profited $29,788 from selling t-shirts and jerseys during the Texas Tech game."
"Response:  $108
Explanation: According to the passage, one T-shirt costs $19 and one jersey costs $34. Therefore, if they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, their total revenue would be:

Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price of jersey
= 157 x $19 + 19 x $34
= $108 + $657
= $765
So, the profit from selling T-shirts is $192 - $765 = -$573, and the profit from selling jerseys is $34 - $657 = -$623."
"Response:  $99
Explanation: According to the passage, the profit from selling one T-shirt is $86 and the profit from selling one jersey is $232. Therefore, if they sold 43 jerseys, their total profit would be $43 x $232 = $9999."
"Response:  $629
Explanation:
The shop sells one T-shirt for $51, and during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, it provides an $8 discount per T-shirt. If it sells 130 T-shirts, the total revenue from T-shirt sales is:
$51 x 130 = $6,530
After applying the discount of $8 per T-shirt, the total revenue from T-shirt sales becomes:
$6,530 - (130 x $8) = $6,290
Therefore, the shop earns $629 in revenue from T-shirt sales."
Response: 3568 dollars 
"Response: 60 / 10 = 6
Therefore, they sold 6 T-shirts during the game."
"Response:  $215 / 5 = $43

Explanation:
The shop sold 5 T-shirts and earned $215 in revenue. Since there are 5 T-shirts, each T-shirt costs $43 ($215 / 5)."
"Response:  $380
Explanation:
The profit from selling t-shirts is $215 per shirt x 20 shirts = $4,300.
The profit from selling jerseys is $5 per jersey x 64 jerseys = $320.
Therefore, the total profit from both sales is $4,300 + $320 = $380."
"Response:  $39,680
Explanation:
To find out how much profit they made from selling jerseys, we need to know the number of jerseys sold and the price per jersey. According to the question, they sold 2 jerseys, and each jersey costs $76. Therefore, their profit from selling jerseys is $76 x 2 = $152.
Now, let's move on to finding the profit from selling t-shirts. We are given that they sold 158 t-shirts at $204 each. Therefore, their total revenue from selling t-shirts is $204 x 158 = $31,652. Subtracting this amount from the total revenue of $105,330 gives us the profit from selling t-shirts, which is $73,678.
Finally, adding the profit from both jerseys and t-shirts gives us the overall profit of $152 + $73,678 = $39,680."
"Response:  $240 - $210 = $30
Explanation: The profit from selling 177 T-shirts is $30 ($240 - $210)."
"Response:  $78 - $113 = $-35$
Explanation:
The profit from selling each jersey is $115 - $78 = $37, and the profit from selling each t-shirt is $25. Therefore, the total profit from selling both jerseys and t-shirts is:
Profit = (Number of jerseys x Profit per jersey) + (Number of t-shirts x Profit per t-shirt)
= ($113 x $37) + ($78 x $25)
= $4095 + $195
= $4290
Since the total profit is negative (-$35), it means that they sold more t-shirts than jerseys."
"Response: 50
Explanation: If they have 5 sets of table settings and each set has 10 chairs, then there are 5 x 10 = 50 chairs in total."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Each table set has 4 chairs, so there are 4 x 2 = 8 chairs in total. Since there are 12 chairs in the backyard, each table set has 8/12 = 6 chairs."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, the group of friends has decided to host their party in their backyard and they have set up three tables with chairs. Since there are a total of nine chairs in the backyard, and the group has three tables with chairs, we can conclude that each table has three chairs. Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response: 140
Explanation: According to the question, there are 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs in the backyard is 11 x 13 = 143 chairs."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60. Since there are 11 people sitting in the chairs, that means 5 chairs are left unused (60 - 11 = 5)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168. Additionally, there are 6 extra chairs, which brings the total number of guest chairs to 168 + 6 = 174."
"Response: 7
Explanation: Each set of tables has 3 chairs, so there are 3 x 4 = 12 chairs in total. Since there will be 14 people attending the party, each person will need one chair, so they will need to buy 14 - 12 = 2 more chairs."
"Response: 56
Explanation: According to the question, there are 9 table sets and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. Since the hosts have decided to provide more chairs than tables, there must be some extra chairs left over. So, the difference between the number of chairs (126) and the number of tables (9) is 126 - 9 = 57 chairs."
Response: 460/5 = 92 dollars per week
"Response: 7 weeks
Explanation: If Louis earned $1216 during harvest and he earns $16 per week, then it will take him 7 weeks to earn that amount."
Response: 498 dollars
"Response:  $846,900

Explanation:
To calculate Louis' total earnings over 73 seasons, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he worked during each season. Since he works for 223 weeks per harvest season and has worked for 73 seasons in total, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Weekly income x Number of weeks worked
= $1,357 x 223 weeks/season x 73 seasons
= $846,900

Therefore, Louis earned $846,900 over his entire career."
Response: 1675 dollars
"Response: 567 dollars.

Explanation:

From the given information, we know that Louis earns $403 per week and pays $49 in rent every week. Since he works for 233 weeks during the harvest season, his total income can be calculated as follows:

Total income = Number of weeks worked x Weekly income
= 233 weeks x $403 per week
= $93,190

However, since he also pays $49 in rent every week, his take-home pay is reduced to:

Take-home pay = Total income - Rent paid
= $93,190 - ($49 x 233 weeks)
= $567

Therefore, Louis earns $567 during the harvest season."
Response:  $388 x 1359 = $524,770
"Response: 5037
Explanation:
Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. Louis earns $491 per week during the harvest season (1181 weeks). So, his total income during this period is:
$491 x 1181 = $583,311
2. He pays $216 in rent every week. So, the total amount he spends on rent during the harvest season is:
$216 x 1181 = $245,916
3. Therefore, Louis's net income during the harvest season is:
$583,311 - $245,916 = $337,395
4. Since the harvest season lasts for 1181 weeks, Louis's total net income over the entire period is:
$337,395 x 1181 = $405,639,505

So, at the end of the harvest season, Louis has $405,639,505 left."
Response:  $133 / 19 weeks = $7.00 per week
"Response: 5 weeks
Explanation: According to the question, Louis earned $2 per week during harvest time. To find out how many weeks he worked, we need to divide the total amount of money he earned ($178) by his weekly earnings ($2). This gives us 5 weeks."
"Response: 56 feet
Explanation:
If Dean's height is 9 feet and the water is 10 times deeper than him, then the water depth would be 9 x 10 = 90 feet."
"Response: 5 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, the water is 2 times deeper than Dean's height, and Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron is 14 feet tall while standing in the water, then the depth of the water would be 2 x 2 = 4 times Dean's height, or 4 x 8 = 32 feet. Since Dean is only 8 feet shorter than Ron, the depth of the water would be 32 - 8 = 24 feet."

Response: 3 packs of invitations are needed to ensure that no friend receives two invitations.
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Carol sent invitations to 12 friends for her birthday party. Since she bought 3 packs of invitations with the same number of invitations in each pack, there are 3 x 12 = 36 invitations in total. Therefore, there are 36 - 12 = 24 invitations left over after sending one to each friend."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
Carol bought 7 packs of invitation cards, and each pack contains 10 cards in total. Therefore, Carol sent out 7 x 10 = 70 invitations in total. Since she only invited two friends, the remaining 63 invitations (70 - 2) are left over."
"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the passage, Carol bought 6 packs of invitation cards, each containing 14 invitations. Therefore, she purchased a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Additionally, she bought 11 extra invitations, bringing the total number of invitations she can send to 84 + 11 = 95 friends."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
Carol bought 2 packs of invitation cards, each containing 3 cards. Therefore, she has a total of 6 cards (2 x 3 = 6). If she wants to invite 9 people, she will need an additional 3 cards (9 - 6 = 3). So, Carol needs to buy 3 more invitation cards."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are 4 seats in the observatory park's viewing car, and it can accommodate 20 people at once. Therefore, one seat can accommodate 5 people (20 / 4 = 5)."
"Response: 36 seats
Explanation:
The number of seats in the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park is given as 36. This can be calculated by multiplying the maximum capacity of each seat (9 people) by the number of times that 18 people can fit in the Ferris wheel simultaneously (18 x 9 = 162). Therefore, there are 36 seats in total in the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park."
Response: 360 people can board at once. Explanation: The total number of seats in all 20 ferry wheels is 19 x 20 = 380 seats. Since each wheel has space for 15 passengers, the maximum number of people who can board at once is 380 / 15 = 25.
"Response: 6
Explanation: If there are 18 seats in the observatory car and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the observatory car is 18 x 15 = 270 people. However, if 10 seats are broken, then the available seating capacity is 18 - 10 = 8 seats. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride the observatory car at one time is 8 / 15 = 6 people."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, there are 6 seats in the observatory car, and each seat can accommodate 14 people. Therefore, the total capacity of the observatory car is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since 16 people are already seated in the car, that means there is still room for 84 - 16 = 68 more people to board the car."
"Response: 70
Explanation:
The total number of small seats = 2 x 14 = 28
The total number of large seats = 23
So, the total number of people who can sit in the park's Ferris wheel = 28 + 23 = 51
Therefore, the number of people who can sit in each small seat = 51 / 28 = 1.86 (approximately 19 people)"

"Response: 360
Explanation:
If Payge helps her mother plant 9 flower beds with 45 seeds each, and they put the same number of seeds in each flower bed, then the total number of seeds planted is:
9 x 45 = 405
So, there are 405 seeds planted in total."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, out of the total of 36 seeds planted, 12 seeds were placed in each of 4 flower beds. Therefore, the number of flower beds is 4."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The total number of seeds planted by Page and her mother is given as 55. Since they planted 15 seeds in each flowerbed, the total number of flowers that grew was 60 (since there are 60 seeds in each flowerbed). Therefore, the total number of flowers grown by Page and her mother is 30 (60 / 2 = 30)."

"Response: 5
Explanation:
If Mashu has 11 friends and gives each of them 2 crackers, then he will have 11 x 2 = 22 crackers in total. Since Mashu already had 3 crackers, he now has 22 + 3 = 25 crackers in total."
"Response: 4 people
Explanation:
If Masaru gave away 8 crackers to his friends and he gave 2 crackers to one friend, then he gave a total of 8 + 2 = 10 crackers to 4 friends. Therefore, the answer is 4 people."
Response:  Each of the 5 friends received 3 crackers (since there were 15 crackers in total and 5 friends). So, each friend got 3/5 = 0.6 crackers. Since there are 10 crackers left after they divided them equally among themselves, each friend got 0.6 x 10 = 6 crackers in total.
"Response: 9
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of friends is x. Since each friend gets an equal amount of crackers, the total number of crackers given to friends is 3x.
Since there are 24 crackers in total and 17 remain after giving them to friends, the number of crackers remaining with Masashi is 24 - 3x.
We can set up the equation as follows:
24 = 3x + (24 - 3x)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
6 = 3x
Now, dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
x = 2
So, Masashi gave 9 crackers to his friends (since there are 3 friends)."
"Response: 22/11 = 2
Explanation: If Mashu has 22 crackers and 34 cakes, and he wants to divide them equally among 11 friends, then each friend will get 2 crackers and 3 cakes."
"Response: 15
Explanation:
Mashu has 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If he gives each of his two friends an equal number of crackers and cakes, then each friend will get 29/4 = 7.25 crackers and 30/4 = 7.5 cakes. Since there are 12 units in a whole (crackers + cakes), each friend will eat 7.25 x 12 = 86 crackers and 7.5 x 12 = 90 cakes."
Response:  Each of the 7 friends received an equal number of crackers and cakes, so they each got 3 of each (crackers + cakes). Therefore, in total, there are 3 x 7 = 21 pieces of food consumed by the group.
"Response: 2/3
Explanation:
If Mashu distributed an equal number of crackers to 18 friends, and there were 36 crackers in total, then each friend received 2/3 of a cracker."
Response:  If Masaru gave away 6 crackers to one friend, and he had 36 crackers in total, then he must have given away a total of 36/6 = 6 friends.
Response:  Each of Masashi's friends received 9 crackers (since there were originally 23 crackers and Masashi gave away 2/5 of them). Therefore, each friend had 9 / 2 = 4.5 crackers. Since you cannot have a half cracker, each friend had 4 crackers.
"Response: 27
Explanation:
Let's analyze the situation:
Mashu has 31 crackers and wants to share them equally among 5 friends. This means each friend will get 6 crackers (31 / 5 = 6).
After sharing, 23 crackers are left with Mashu. So, the number of crackers given to each friend is 6."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
If there are 4 people and each person gets an equal share of crackers and cake, then the total number of crackers and cake divided by 4 is the amount each person will get.
In this case, there are 32 crackers and 98 pieces of cake, so the total amount is 32 + 98 = 130. Dividing this amount by 4 gives us 130 / 4 = 32.5, which rounded to the nearest whole number is 32. Therefore, each person will get 32 crackers and 32 pieces of cake."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
From the information given in the question, we know that Maeshu has 10 crackers and 8 cakes to distribute equally among 4 friends. Since each friend will get an equal share of both crackers and cakes, the number of crackers each friend gets is half of Maeshu's total supply (i.e., 10/4 = 2.5). Similarly, the number of cakes each friend gets is also half of Maeshu's total supply (i.e., 8/4 = 2). Therefore, each friend will get 2 crackers and 2 cakes.
So, the answer is 3."
"Response: 28
Explanation:
Mashu gave each of his 28 friends either a cracker or a cake, but not both. Therefore, the total number of crackers and cakes eaten by all 28 friends is equal to 28."
Response:  Debbie bought 74 bottles of water during the sale. Since she drank 109 bottles in one day and the sale lasted for 74 days, she must have purchased 74 x 109 = 8260 bottles in total.

"Response: 2 days
Explanation: According to the question, Debby drank 144 bottles of water per day for some time. If she had 301 bottles in total and there are 157 bottles left, it means that she drank for 2 days (301 - 157 = 144)."
Response:  Debby held onto the water bottles for 2 days (4/88 = 0.0469 or 46.9%).
Response:  The number of days that the soda bottles will be held by Debbie is 7. Explanation: According to the problem statement, Debbie buys 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles during the sale. If she drinks 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles per day, then she will finish all the water bottles in 312 / 31 = 10 days. Since she also drank 4 soda bottles per day, it means she finished all the soda bottles in 256 / 4 = 63 days, which is equal to 7 days. Therefore, the number of days that the soda bottles will be held by Debbie is 7.
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: According to the question, Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day, which means she consumes 6 x 6 = 36 bottles of water in one week. Since she has bought a total of 12 bottles of water, that means she can hold onto them for 3 days (12 / 36 = 0.33 days)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Debby drank 15 bottles of water in one day, which means she had 15 / 95 = 0.16 days worth of water left after one day. Since she bought 95 bottles of water, it will last her 95 / 0.16 = 575 days."
"Response: 4 days
Explanation: Debby bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water. If she drinks 122 bottles of water per day and 9 bottles of soda per day, it means that she will finish the soda in 4 days (360 / 9 = 40). Therefore, the soda bottles will last for 4 days."

"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Fei has 35 pens and 7 pencils. If she lined up all the pens in one row, there would be 35 pens in that row. Since each pen takes up 1 space, there will be 35 spaces left after placing all the pens in a row. Therefore, Fei can line up 20 rows of pencils (7 pencils x 20 rows = 140 spaces)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Fei has 4 pencils and 27 erasers, which means she has a total of 31 objects. Since each row has 19 objects, there are 31 / 19 = 5 rows in total. Therefore, Fei has 5 pencils."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Fei has 36 pencils and 30 erasers. Since each row has 7 erasers, Fei has 36 / 7 = 5 erasers in each row. Therefore, she has 5 x 7 = 35 erasers in total."

"Response: 7 x 36 = 252 seats
Explanation:
There are 7 school buses and each bus can accommodate 36 students, so there will be 7 x 36 = 252 seats in total for all the buses."
"Response: 320
Explanation:
The number of students in the school can be calculated as follows:
Number of classrooms x Number of students per classroom = Total number of students
In this case, there are 84 classrooms and 30 students per classroom (based on the assumption that each bus can accommodate 30 students). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:
84 x 30 = 2520 students
However, since 95 buses are available, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses to get the average number of students per bus:
2520 / 95 = 26.7 students per bus
Therefore, there are approximately 26.7 students per bus."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
The number of students in each class is given as 66, and there are 67 classes in total. Therefore, the total number of students is 66 x 67 = 4252. Since there are only 6 seats per bus, we need at least 4252 / 6 = 708 buses to accommodate all the students for the field trip."
Response: 4 buses are needed for the school trip. Explanation: According to the question, there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 58 students. Therefore, the total number of students going on the field trip is 87 x 58 = 4960 students. Since each student needs two seats on the bus (as there are two seats per row), the total number of passengers that can fit on one bus is 4960 / 2 = 2480 passengers. Since there are four buses available, we need at least 2480 / 4 = 610 passengers per bus to accommodate all the students. Hence, 4 buses are required for the school trip.
"Response: 
The number of students in each class is 120/24 = 5."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
The total number of students in the school is 102. Since 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, the minimum number of buses required for the field trip is 102 - 22 = 80. Since each bus has 8 seats, the minimum number of buses needed is 80 / 8 = 10. Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response: 36
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Number of classrooms in school = 102
Number of students in school = 11
Number of seats in each bus = 99
Number of students who want to go on the field trip = 8
Now, let's calculate the number of students who will participate in the field trip:
Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go = Available seats per bus x Total number of buses
= (102 - 8) x 99
= 36
Therefore, 36 students will participate in the field trip."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
The number of students in the school is 111, and each bus can accommodate 3 students. Therefore, we need 4 buses to transport all the students for the field trip."
"Response: 50
Explanation:
The school has 17 classrooms and 46 buses. If all buses are full (which is assumed in this problem), then each bus can accommodate 50 students (since there are 46 buses and 92 total students)."

Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 30 books in total, as he spent 12 days reading each book (66 pages/day x 12 days = 792 days). Therefore, if it took him 492 days to read all the books, he must have read 30 books."
"Response: 8 pages per day 
Explanation: According to the passage, Frank read his favorite book for 16 days, and if the book had 112 pages, he would have read 8 pages per day (16 days x 8 pages/day = 128 pages)."
"Response: 30 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 8 pages per day, and the book has 576 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 576 / 8 = 72 days. However, since the question asks for the number of days Frank spent reading the book ""in total,"" we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number, which is 30 days."
"Response: 9 pages per day 
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 450 pages of a book that had 41 chapters. If he took 30 days to finish reading the book, then he read an average of 9 pages per day (450 pages / 30 days)."
"Response: 
The book has 3 chapters with an average of 594 pages each, so the total number of pages in the book is:
3 x 594 = 1782 pages
Therefore, Frank read the book for 607 days."
"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the passage, Frank read 405 pages of the book every day for 664 days. Therefore, he read 37 chapters per day (405 / 664 = 37)."

"Response:  Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 10 guests, but only 9 guests arrived. If each guest received an equal number of cookies, then how many cookies did each guest receive?

Solution:
Let X be the number of cookies each guest received. Since there were 9 guests and Brenda's mother prepared 18 cookies in total, we can write the equation:
X + 9 = 18
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 18 - 9
X = 9
So, each guest received 9 cookies."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for two guests. If each guest had an equal number of cookies (as assumed in the problem), then together they would have 14 + 14 = 28 cookies. Therefore, each guest had 28 / 2 = 14 cookies."

"Response: 395
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the previous day was x.
Since Rachel knew that 132 people visited the palace today, we can write an equation:
x + 132 = 406 (total number of visitors in 327 days)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 395 (visitors in the previous day)
Therefore, 395 people visited Buckingham Palace in the previous day."
"Response: 376
Explanation:
If 829 people visited Buckingham Palace in the last 85 days and 45 of them visited after their meal, then the number of visitors on that particular day is:

The information given in the question is as follows:
* On the day after they had lunch, 705 people visited Buckingham Palace.
* The previous day, 191 people visited Buckingham Palace.
* Two days before that, 457 people visited Buckingham Palace.

To find out how many more people visited Buckingham Palace on the day after the meal compared to the previous day, we can subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the day after the meal:
705 - 191 = 514

So, there were 514 more people who visited Buckingham Palace on the day after the meal than on the previous day. To find out how many more people visited over the past 245 days, we can multiply this difference by 245:
514 x 245 = 123,900

Therefore, there were 123,900 more people who visited Buckingham Palace over the past 245 days compared to the previous 245 days."

"Response: 30 drums/day 
Explanation: According to the passage, it takes 5 days for 266 people to collect 90 drums of grapes. This means that each person can collect an average of 90 / 266 = 30 drums per day."
"Response: 305 drums of grapes (or 305 x 244 = 73,680 drums)
Explanation:
The last visit of the man was to his favorite vineyard, where he heard that 294 harvesters were able to collect 244 drums of grapes and 47 drums of raspberries in one day. Since it took 146 days for the harvesters to gather all the grapes, we can calculate the total number of drums of grapes collected as follows:
Total number of drums of grapes = Number of harvesters x Number of drums per day x Number of days taken to harvest
= 294 x 244 x 146
= 305 drums
Therefore, the answer is 305 drums of grapes."
Response: 4968 drums of grapes will be harvested in 77 days. Explanation: According to the information provided, there are 235 people who can collect 100 drums of raspberries and 221 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, in 77 days, the total number of drums collected will be: 235 x 100 = 23,500 drums of raspberries + 221 x 221 = 49,680 drums of grapes = 4968 drums of grapes.
Response: 3649 drums of grapes will be harvested over 58 days. Explanation: According to the question, after stopping checking his favorite vineyard 57 times, he was told that 108 drums of grapes are harvested every day. Therefore, if this continues for 58 days, the total number of drums harvested would be: 108 x 58 = 6264 drums. However, since there are 252 workers, the actual number of drums harvested per worker is: 6264 / 252 = 3649 drums.
"Response: 5 days
Explanation: If it takes 8 drums of persimmons per day and there are 36 harvesters, then the total number of drums collected in one day is 36 x 8 = 288 drums. To collect 240 drums of persimmons, it will take 5 days (240 / 288 = 0.83 days)."

Explanation:
Let's assume that all 800059 children who went to camp are away from home, so there are no children left at home. Therefore, the number of children remaining at home is equal to the total number of children in Lawrence County minus the number of children who went to camp.

Total number of children in Lawrence County = 828521
Number of children who went to camp = 800059
Number of children remaining at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp
= 828521 - 800059
= 736704

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, John used a total of 11 bolts to fix the large wooden planks onto the wall. Since each plank requires 3 bolts, the number of planks that can be fixed with the remaining 8 bolts is 8 / 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 5 planks in total (5 x 3 = 15)."
Response:  John needs 17 nails (15 for the large planks and 2 for the small planks).
"Response: 32
Explanation: John needs to use 32 nails (2 nails per board x 16 boards) to attach the wooden planks to the wall."
"Response: 56
Explanation: According to the question, each wood plank requires 74 nails. Since there are 8 wood planks in total, the number of nails required is 8 x 74 = 560. Therefore, John needs 56 wood planks for the wall."
Response:  John needs 39 planks of wood (12 large + 17 small). To calculate this, you can use the following formula: Total number of planks = Number of large planks x Number of nails per large plank + Number of small planks x Number of nails per small plank. In this case, the total number of planks needed is: Total number of planks = 12 x 14 + 17 x 25 = 39.
