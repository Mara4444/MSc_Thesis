Response: 9 more campers went to go kayaking in the afternoon than in the morning.
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the question, 15 campers went for a morning canoe trip and some other campers went for an afternoon canoe trip. If a total of 32 campers went for a canoe trip that day, then the number of campers who went in the afternoon is equal to 32 - 15 = 17."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, a total of 60 campers went canoeing that day. If some campers went canoeing in the morning and others in the afternoon, then the number of campers who went canoeing in the morning is equal to the total number of campers minus the number of campers who went canoeing in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of campers who went canoeing in the morning is 60 - 7 = 53."

Response: 5 (more went in the morning than in the evening)
Response: 7 (7 Campeurs)
Response: 44 campers went canoeing in total.
"Response: 17
Explanation: Let X be the number of campers who went canoeing in the morning and Y be the number of campers who went canoeing in the afternoon. Since 29 campers went canoeing in total, we have X + Y = 29. Moreover, since 66 campers went hiking in the morning, we have X + 66 = 132 (since there were only 66 campers left to go hiking after some went canoeing). Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us X = 17 and Y = 12. Therefore, 17 more campers went canoeing in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response: 35
Explanation: Let X be the number of campers who went kayaking and Y be the number of campers who went hiking. Since 41 campers went kayaking in the morning, we have X = 41. Similarly, since 26 campers went kayaking in the afternoon, we have X + 26 = 35 (since there are only 35 campers left). Therefore, X = 41 and Y = 35. So, the total number of campers who did both kayaking and hiking is 41 + 35 = 76."

"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 7 mature apples from her tree, leaving the tree with 5 apples remaining. If 3 of these apples are mature and the rest are immature, then the number of immature apples is equal to the total number of apples minus the number of mature apples, which is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, the tree has 2 immature apples remaining."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 2 mature apples from her tree. This means that there were originally 4 mature apples on the tree (7 - 2 = 4)."
"Response: 8 apples (or ""pommes"")
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 6 mature apples from her tree. Now, the tree has 2 mature apples and 4 immature apples. To find out how many apples the tree had at first, we need to subtract the number of apples that were picked (6) from the total number of apples it had (8). Therefore, the tree had 8 apples at the start."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 3 mature apples from her tree. Now, the tree has 2 mature apples and 27 immature apples. To find out how many mature apples the tree had at first, we need to subtract the number of mature apples that were picked (3) from the total number of apples on the tree (27). Therefore, the tree had 5 mature apples at the start."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree initially. Then, 2 new apples grew on the tree, bringing the total number of apples to 6. Therefore, the tree had 9 apples at first (7 + 2)."
"Response: 6 pommes (or ""apples"") are now on Rachel's tree."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 2 apples from one of her apple trees. This means that there are now 7 apples left on the tree. To find out how many apples the tree had at first, we need to subtract the number of apples Rachel picked from the total number of apples on the tree. Since there were 7 apples left on the tree after Rachel picked 2, this means that there were originally 9 apples on the tree (7 - 2 = 9)."

Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 2 more billes than Doug initially. So, Ed had 20 billes and Doug had 18 billes. Then, Doug lost some of his billes at the playing field, which means he has fewer billes now. Since Ed still has 20 billes, we can deduce that Doug must have lost 3 billes. Therefore, the correct answer is 3."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
Ed had 10 more balls than Doug initially, so Ed had 45 balls and Doug had 25 balls (10 + 15 = 25). Then, Doug lost 11 of his balls at the playing field, leaving him with 14 balls (25 - 11 = 14). Therefore, Ed had 45 - 11 = 34 balls more than Doug at that time."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 6 more billes than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 22 billes and he gave 6 to Doug, then Doug must have had 16 billes (22 - 6 = 16). Then, Doug lost 7 of his billes at the playing field, so he now has 9 billes (16 - 7 = 9)."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 5 more billes than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 27 billes, then Doug must have started with 20 billes (5 + 15 = 20)."
"Response: 31
Explanation: At first, Ed had 24 more balls than Doug. Then, Doug lost 27 balls at the playing field while Ed found 9 additional balls. So, Ed now has 24 + 9 = 33 balls more than Doug."
"Response: 12
Explanation: At first, Ed had 29 more balls than Doug. Then, he lost 17 of his balls at the playing field. So, Ed had 29 - 17 = 12 more balls than Doug after losing those balls."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 19 more billes than Doug initially. If he lost some of his billes at the playing field, then he has 8 more billes than Doug now. To find out how many billes Ed lost, we need to subtract the number of billes he gained from the initial difference between him and Doug. So, Ed lost 7 billes."
"Response: 11
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 30 more balls than Doug initially. Then, he lost 21 of his balls at the game field. So, Ed has 91 balls (initially) - 21 = 70 balls left with him. Therefore, Ed has 30 + 70 = 100 balls in total, which is 11 more than Doug's initial number of balls."

"Response: 333
Explanation: The number of girls in the school is given as 569 and the number of boys is given as 236. Therefore, the difference between the number of girls and boys is 569 - 236 = 333."
"Response: 765 (or 766)
Explanation: Let F be the number of girls in the school and G be the number of boys. We know that F + G = 34 (the total number of students). Also, we are told that G is equal to 841 times the number of girls. So, we can write an equation:
G = 841F
Now, we want to find out how many more boys than girls there are in the school. So, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:
Number of boys minus number of girls = G - F
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
G - F = 841(34) - 34
= 765 (or 766)
Therefore, there are 765 (or 766) more boys than girls in the school."
"Response: 253
Explanation: According to the question, there are 485 students in total, and 232 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 485 - 232 = 253."

Explanation: According to the question, there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls, which means there are 510 boys in the school as well."
Response: 1149 (868 + 281)
"Response: 842
Explanation: Let F be the number of girls in the school and G be the number of boys. According to the question, G = 142 > F, so we can write: F + G = 700 (since there are 700 students in total). Substituting G = 142 into this equation, we get: F + 142 = 700, which simplifies to: F = 558. Therefore, there are 558 girls in the school."
"Response: 938
Explanation: Initially, there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school, for a total of 928 students. Then, 418 additional girls joined the school, bringing the total number of students to 938."
"Response: 946
Explanation: Initially, there were 902 girls in the school. Then, 44 additional girls joined the school, so now there are 946 girls in the school (902 + 44 = 946)."
"Response: 278
Explanation: Let F be the number of girls in the original class and G be the number of boys. Since there are 632 girls and 410 boys, we have F = 632 and G = 410. When 465 additional girls joined the school, the total number of girls became F + 465 = 697. Therefore, the difference between the number of girls and boys is F - G = 697 - 410 = 287."
"Response: 904
Explanation: Let X be the number of girls in the school initially. Since there are 732 girls and 761 boys initially, we can write:
X + (761 - 732) = 785
Now, after 682 more girls have joined the school, we have:
X + (761 - 732) + (682 - 732) = 904
Simplifying and solving for X, we get:
X = 904
Therefore, there are 904 girls in the school now."
"Response: 305
Explanation: Let X be the number of boys in the school initially. Then, the total number of students in the school is given by X + 135 (girls) = 496. Similarly, the total number of students including the new ones is given by X + 214 (boys) + 910 = 1226. Therefore, there are 305 boys in the school now."
Response: 726 (308 x 318) + 36 = 764
Response: 694 (315 girls + 309 boys + 772 teachers)
Response: 337 (rounded)
"Response: 1330 (or 1331)
Explanation: Let F be the number of girls in the school and G be the number of boys. Since there are 458 more girls than boys, we can write: F = 458 + G. Also, since there are 692 girls in total, we have: F + G = 692. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get: F = 1330 (or 1331), and G = -738 (or -739). So, there are 1330 (or 1331) girls and -738 (or -739) boys in the school."
"Response: 189
Explanation: Let G be the number of boys in the school initially and F be the number of girls. We know that G + F = 362 (total students) and F = 257 (initial number of girls). Now, we have 403 additional girls joining the school, so the total number of girls becomes F + 403 = 650. Therefore, the difference between the number of boys and girls is: Boys - Girls = G - F = 362 - 257 = 105. So, there are 105 more girls than boys in the school now."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Zachary performed 58 abdominal exercises and 46 chest press exercises (pompes). Therefore, he did 10 more abdominal exercises than chest press exercises."
"Response: 48
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Zachary did 19 pompes today.
David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 39 + 19 = 58 pompes.
John did 13 fewer than David, so John did 58 - 13 = 45 pompes.
Therefore, David did 48 pompes (58 - 13)."
Response: 30
"Response: 24
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Zachary has done 15 pompes in the gym today.
David has done 39 more pompes than Zachary. So, David has done 39 + 15 = 54 pompes.
John has done 9 fewer pompes than David. So, John has done 54 - 9 = 45 pompes.
Therefore, Zachary has done 15 + 45 = 60 pompes.
So, the answer is 60."

Therefore, Zachary has done 27 push-ups."
Response: 94 (56 + 38)
"Response: 59
Explanation: According to the question, David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 sit-ups, then David did 34 + 40 = 74 push-ups and 62 - 17 = 45 sit-ups."
"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the question, David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 sit-ups, then Zachary did 25 more sit-ups than push-ups (58 - 33 = 25)."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary during their workout at the gym today. However, Zachary did 5 more push-ups than he did abdominal crunches (or ""abdos""). Therefore, Zachary did 10 more abdominal crunches than push-ups."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, the sauterelle sauté 9 inches and the grenouille sauté 12 inches. To find out how much more the grenouille sauté than the sauterelle, we subtract the distance sauté by the sauterelle from the distance sauté by the grenouille: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, the grenouille sauté 3 inches more than the sauterelle."
Response: 66 inches (or 168 cm)
"Response: 54
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The sauterelle sauté 36 inches (or 36 pouces).
* The grenouille sauté 17 inches more than the sauterelle, so it sauté 36 + 17 = 53 inches (or 53 pouces).
* The souris sauté 15 inches less than the grenouille, so it sauté 53 - 15 = 38 inches (or 38 pouces).

Therefore, the grenouille sauté 54 inches (or 54 pouces), which is the sum of its own jump and the difference between the jumps of the sauterelle and the souris."
Response: 30 inches (76 cm)
Response: 30 inches (or any other unit of measurement you prefer)
Response: 58 inches (or 147 cm)
Response: 10 inches (or 25 cm)
"Response: 10 inches (or 25 cm)
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The sauterelle sauté 24 pouces = 24 x 12 = 288 centimètres (cm).
* The grenouille sauta 33 pouces de plus que la sauterelle = 33 + 24 = 57 cm.
* The souris sauta 5 pouces de moins que la grenouille = 5 - 57 = -52 cm.

So, the souris sauted 52 cm less than the sauterelle."
Response: 11 pouces
Response: 40 inches (or 102 cm)
Response: 25 inches (or 63 cm)
Response: 47 inches (or any other unit of measurement that you prefer)
"Response: 7 inches (or 18 cm)
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
La sauterelle a sauté de 21 pouces = 53 cm
La grenouille a sauté de 25 pouces de plus que la grenouille = 53 + 25 = 78 cm
La souris a sauté de 16 pouces de moins que la grenouille = 78 - 16 = 62 cm
So, the difference between the distance jumped by the sauterelle and the distance jumped by the souris is 78 - 62 = 16 cm or 7 inches."
Response: 22 inches (or 56 cm) more than the sauterelle.
Response: 27 inches (or 68.5 cm)
"Response: 5 pouces
Explanation: According to the passage, ""La souris a sauté de 16 pouces de moins que la grenouille,"" which means that the souris sauté 16 - 16 = 0 inches less than the grenouille. Since the grenouille sauté 37 inches more than the sauterelle, we can calculate the distance traveled by the souris as follows: Souris's distance = Grenouille's distance + (Souris's distance - Grenouille's distance) = 37 + (-16) = 52 inches. Therefore, the souris sauté 52 inches more than the sauterelle."
"Response: 8 tasses of flour (not 9)
Explanation: The problem states that Mary has already added 5 tasses of farine and the recipe requires 14 tasses of farine in total. Therefore, to find out how many tasses of farine Mary needs to add now, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total required: 14 - 5 = 9. So, Mary needs to add 9 more tasses of farine."
Response: 7 tasses (or 700 grams) of sugar.
Response: 2 tasses de farine.
"Response: 4 tasses
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already put some farine in the bowl and needs 2 more tasses of farine than she does of sugar. Since there are 11 tasses of farine required for the recipe and 7 tasses of sugar, if Mary has already used 4 tasses of farine (which is less than her total need), then she must have used 3 tasses of farine so far (since 4 - 3 = 1). Therefore, Mary has used 4 tasses of farine."
"Response: 4 tasses
Explanation: According to the question, if Mary has already added 3 tasses of farine (which is equal to 300 grams), and she needs to add 6 more tasses (or 6 x 500 grams = 3000 grams), then the total amount of farine required for the recipe is 3 + 3000 = 3003 grams or 4 tasses."

Response: 3 tasses de sucre + 4 tasses de sel = 7 tasses de sucre et 7 tasses de sel.
Response: 11 tasses of sugar.
Response: 3 tasses de farine.
Response: 7 tasses of flour (not 6).
Response: 4 tasses of sugar (since 14 - 11 = 3).
"Response: 7 tasses
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already put ""few tasses of farine"" which means she has used some amount of farine. To find out how much farine she has used, we can subtract the number of tasses she has already used from the total amount required for the recipe. In this case, the recipe requires 10 tasses of farine and Mary needs 5 more tasses than the amount of sucre she has. So, if she has used few tasses of farine, it means she hasn't used all 10 tasses, and therefore, she must have used 7 tasses of farine."
Response: 4 tasses of flour have already been used by Mary.
Response: 7 tasses (or 7/4 = 1.75 cups) of farina must be added to complete the recipe.
Response: 1 tasse of sugar.

"Response: 183
Explanation: According to the question, at the beginning of the year, Paul had 253 crayons and lost or gave away 70 during the year. Therefore, he had 183 crayons left at the end of the year."
"Response: 374
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had received 374 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons, leaving him with only 177. Therefore, the number of crayons he received for his birthday is 374."
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 440 crayons for his birthday and gave away 111 of them during the school year. This means he lost 106 crayons. Therefore, he has 440 - 106 = 334 crayons left."
"Response: 213 - 16 = 207
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 213 crayons during the school year and lost 16. Therefore, the total number of crayons he had at the end of the year is 207 (213 - 16)."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 571 crayons during the school year and lost 161. This means he had 571 - 161 = 410 crayons left at the end of the year. Since he received 589 crayons as a gift for his birthday, he must have given away more than he lost. Therefore, the difference between the number of crayons he gave away and the number he lost is 410 - 161 = 250 crayons. So, he gave away 250 more crayons than he lost."
"Response: 538
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 90 crayons during the school year and lost 412 crayons. Therefore, he has lost a total of 412 - 90 = 322 crayons more than he gave away. So, he has lost 538 crayons in total."
Response: 301 crayons.
"Response: 535
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 52 crayons during the school year and lost 535. Therefore, he has 492 crayons left, which is the difference between the number of crayons given away (52) and the number lost (535)."
Response: 367 crayons have been lost or given away.
"Response: 240
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* At the beginning of the year, Paul had 531 crayons and 38 gumes.
* After one year, he didn't lose any gummes but lost some crayons (without specifying how many).
* At the end of the year, he had 391 crayons left.

So, to find out how many more crayons Paul had than gummies at the end of the year, we can subtract the number of gummies he had at the start from the number of crayons he had at the end:

391 - 38 = 240

Therefore, Paul had 240 more crayons than gummies at the end of the year."
"Response: 79
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Paul received a total of 601 crayons and 406 gummies for his birthday.
* At the end of the school year, he had 336 remaining gummies without losing any.

Now, let's find out how many more gummies Paul has than crayons:

Total number of gummies = 406
Total number of crayons = 601

Difference between gummies and crayons = Total number of gummies - Total number of crayons
= 406 - 601
= -205

So, Paul has 205 more gummies than crayons. Therefore, the answer is 79 (205 - 336)."
"Response: 300
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 300 crayons for his birthday and had 291 left at the end of the school year after losing or giving away 315. Therefore, he initially received 300 crayons."
"Response: 79
Explanation: According to the question, Paul lost 231 crayons during the school year and gave away 308 to his friends. Therefore, he gave away more crayons than he lost by 79 (308 - 231 = 79)."
"Response: 168
Explanation:
Let G be the number of gummies and C be the number of crayons. Since Paul had 457 gummies at first, we can say that G = 457. At the end of the year, he received more gummies, so his total number of gummies became G + X, where X is the number of additional gummies he received. Therefore, the number of crayons he had at the end of the year is equal to C - (G + X).
Since there are 320 crayons in total, we can set up the equation:
C - (G + X) = 320
Solving for X, we get:
X = 168
Therefore, Paul had 168 more crayons than gummies at the end of the year."
Response: 8 (or 8 more than those who remained)
"Response: 2
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of clients who were present initially was x. Since 3 clients left, the number of clients remaining is x - 3. And since 4 clients remained after some clients had left, we can write: x - 3 = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. Therefore, there were 2 more clients who remained than those who left."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The server had clients before the departure of 9 clients. This means that the total number of clients was greater than 9.
* After the departure of 9 clients, the server still had 12 clients. This means that the remaining number of clients is equal to 12 - 9 = 3.
* Therefore, the server had 30 clients at the beginning (30 = 12 + 9)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: The server had 14 clients initially and then 5 of them left, leaving 9 clients behind."
"Response: 5
Explanation: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of clients that were initially on the server (i.e., before any clients left). Since there were 13 clients in total, we can write:
x + 5 = 13
Now, some clients left, and the server gained 4 new clients. So, let y be the number of clients that left:
y = x - 4
Substituting this equation into the first one, we get:
(x + 5) - 4 = 13
Simplifying, we get:
x + 9 = 18
Solving for x, we find that there were originally 9 clients on the server (i.e., x = 9):
x = 9
So, 5 clients left the server."
"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The server had 12 clients initially.
15 clients left, so the number of clients remaining is: 12 - 15 = -3.
Then, 14 new clients arrived, so the updated number of clients is: -3 + 14 = 11.
Therefore, the server has 11 clients remaining."
Response: 5 new clients arrived.
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The server had 8 clients initially.
* After some clients left, it had 5 remaining clients.
* Then, 99 new clients joined the server.

So, if 99 new clients joined, and there were only 5 clients left after some had departed, then the total number of clients that had departed is:

New clients - Remaining clients = 99 - 5 = 94

Therefore, 94 clients had departed from the server."
"Response: 26
Explanation: Initially, the server had 12 clients. Then, some left, leaving it with 14 clients. Later, 10 new clients arrived, bringing the total number of clients to 26."

Explanation: If Dan spent $4 and bought 10 bars of candy for $3, then he has $4 - $3 = $1 left over."
Response: 2$ 
Response: 10 dollars - 3 dollars = 7 dollars 
"Response: 3 dollars 
Explanation: To find out how much Dan spent on chocolate compared to the amount he spent on gum, we need to subtract the cost of the gum from the total amount he spent on both items. According to the question, Dan spent $7 on chocolate and $2 on gum, so if we subtract $2 from $7, we get $5. Therefore, Dan spent $3 more on chocolate than he did on gum ($7 - $2 = $5)."

"Response: 36 (books)
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them during a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Then, after selling those books, he bought 42 new ones, which means he now has 21 + 42 = 63 books in total. Since he has 15 books left, that means he sold 63 - 15 = 48 more books than he bought. So, the answer is 48."
"Response: 45 (books)
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them during a garage sale, resulting in him having 116 books afterward.

Response: 2 (she cut 2 additional roses)
"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 21 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica threw 34 more roses into the vase and cut some new roses from her garden of flowers to add to the vase. This means that she added a total of 34 + 15 = 49 roses to the vase. Therefore, she threw away 21 - 49 = -28 roses more than she cut from her garden."
Response: 13 (Jessica has cut 13 additional roses from her garden of 59 roses)
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some additional roses from her garden that had a total of 12 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses in the vase is 25 (13 + 12). Since Jessica only cut roses from her own garden, she did not affect the number of roses in the vase. So, the number of roses remaining in her garden is 9 (12 - 3 = 9)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the passage, there were originally 15 roses and 62 orchidées in the vase. If Jessica cut some additional roses and orchidées from her garden of flowers, then there are now 17 roses and 96 orchidées in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the original number of roses (15) from the new total number of roses (17): 17 - 15 = 3. Therefore, Jessica cut 3 roses from her garden of flowers."
"Response: 3

"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 21 capsules of bottles in his collection and found some more at the park, which means he now has 53 capsules of bottles in total. To find out how many capsules he found at the park, we can subtract the number he already had (21) from the total number of capsules he has now (53), which gives us 32."
"Response: 51
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had thrown away 51 old bottle caps before collecting 63 new ones at the park. Therefore, he had 51 + 63 = 114 capsules of bottles in his collection initially."
"Response: 1
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 36 capsules at the park that he did not have before (he had thrown away 35). So, he has gained 36 - 35 = 1 more capsule than he threw away."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 30 capsules at the park and threw away 63 old ones, which means he threw away 33 more than he found. Therefore, the number of capsules Danny threw away is 33."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Danny had 14 capsules of bottles at the beginning. This is because he found 22 capsules at the park and already had 14 capsules in his collection, which means that he started with 14 capsules."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had found 30 emballages at the park. After collecting some of them, he now has 57 emballages in his collection. Therefore, he had 30 emballages at the start."
Response: 26 (found at least 26 more capsules than emballages)
"Response: 33
Explanation: Let C be the number of capsules of bottles and E be the number of packages found by Danny at the park. We know that C + E = 68 (given). Since Danny has 51 packages in his collection, we can write E = 51 - C. Substituting this value for E in the equation C + E = 68, we get 2C = 17. Therefore, C = 8. So, Danny found 33 packages more than capsules of bottles at the park."
"Response: 35 (71 - 24 = 47; 28 + 16 = 44)"
"Response: 43 - 27 = 16
Therefore, Danny has 16 more emballages than capsules of bottles in his collection now."
"Response: 41
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Danny has collected 25 capsules of bottles now.
* He lost 66 capsules at the park.
* So, initially, he had (25 - 66) = -41 capsules.

Since negative numbers are not allowed in math, we can change the answer to positive 41. Therefore, Danny had 41 capsules at the beginning."
Response: 9 (Danny found 9 additional capsules of bottles at the park)
"Response: 60
Explanation: According to the question, Danny threw away 60 old capsules and found 58 new ones. This means that he had 60 + 58 = 118 capsules at first. Since he now has 67 capsules in his collection, he must have started with 118 - 67 = 51 capsules."
"Response: 44
Explanation: Let X be the number of capsules of bottles that Danny threw in the park. Since he found 50 new capsules, we can write:
X + 50 = 60
Subtracting X from both sides gives us:
50 = 10
So Danny found 44 additional capsules at the park compared to those he threw away."
Response: 6 (or 56 - 48 = 6)
"Response: 33
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

Danny had collected 82 emballages and 29 capsules of bottles at the park.
Now, he has 42 capsules of bottles and 61 emballages in his collection.
So, the number of capsules of bottles Danny had at the start is:
42 - 29 = 13
Therefore, Danny had 13 capsules of bottles at the beginning."
"Response: 47
Explanation: Let X be the number of emballages that Danny had at the start. Since he found 66 emballages and 39 capsules of bottles at the park, the total number of items he collected was X + 66 + 39 = 105. Now, he has 16 capsules of bottles and 68 emballages in his collection, so the difference between the original number of emballages and the current number is 68 - X = 47. Therefore, Danny had 47 emballages at the start."
"Response: 9 (or 9 more)
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Danny found 46 emballages and 50 capsules of bottles at the park.
* Now, he has 21 capsules of bottles and 52 emballages in his collection.
* So, the number of capsules of bottles Danny found at the park is 50 - 21 = 29 more than the number of emballages he found.
* Therefore, Danny found 9 more capsules of bottles than emballages at the park."
"Response: 40 - 27 = 13
Therefore, Danny has found 13 more emballages than capsules of bottles at the park."

"Response: 3 pêches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 9 fewer pears than Steven and 18 more pears than Jill. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 9 pears, and Jill has x + 18 pears. Since Steven has 16 pears, we can set up the equation:
x = 16 - (x - 9)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 25
Therefore, Steven has 3 pears more than Jill."
Response: 24 - 6 = 18
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, and Jill has 87 peaches, we can deduce that Jake has 20 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, the answer is 20."
"Response: 4 pêches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 16 pêches fewer than Steven. So if Steven has x pêches, then Jake has x - 16 pêches. Since Jill has 12 pêches and is between Jake and Steven, we can set up the equation: Jill's pêches = (Jake's pêches) + (Steven's pêches). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Jill's pêches = (16 - 16) + x = 0 + x = 4 pêches. Therefore, Jill has 4 pêches more than Jake."
Response: 30 pêches
Response: 5 pommes
"Response: 2 pêches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 17 pêches and 16 pommes. To find out how many more pommes than pêches Steven has, we subtract the number of pommes from the number of pêches: 17 - 16 = 1. So, Steven has 1 pôme more than he has pêches."

"Response: 26 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, Olivia had $54 in her purse before visiting the grocery store. After she visited the store and spent $29, there were only $26 left in her purse. Therefore, she spent $26 at the store."
"Response: 90 dollars
Explanation: To find out how much money Olivia has left after spending $38 at the grocery store, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount of money in her wallet. The equation is:

Initial amount of money - Amount spent = Remaining amount of money

In this case, the initial amount of money in Olivia's wallet was $128, and she spent $38 at the grocery store. Therefore, the remaining amount of money in her wallet is:

$128 - $38 = $90

So, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after shopping at the grocery store."

"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, after adding 11 new applications and then removing some of them, Dave had 4 applications left on his phone. To find out how many he removed, we need to subtract the number of new applications (11) from the total number of applications he had at first (10 + 11 = 21). So, he removed 21 - 4 = 17 applications."
Response: 65 (Dave added 89 new apps and subtracted some, leaving him with 24 apps, so he added 65 more apps than he subtracted).
Response: 53 (Dave added 71 new apps and then removed some of them, so he subtracted 53 from the total number of apps he had at first).
"Response: 9 (applications)
Explanation: According to the question, after Dave had deleted some applications and files from his phone, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. To find out how many applications he had originally, we can divide the number of original applications by the number of remaining applications: 16 / 5 = 9. Therefore, Dave had deleted 9 applications from his phone."
Response: 4 fichiers (or files) were deleted by Dave.
"Response: 7
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially.
After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files.
So, the number of applications he has now is 21 - 15 = 6 more than the initial number of applications.
Similarly, the number of files he has now is 4 - 24 = -20 fewer than the initial number of files.
Therefore, the number of applications he has left on his phone is 6, and the number of files he has left is -20."
"Response: 9 (fichiers)
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some applications and files, Dave has 6 applications left on his phone. This means he had 19 - 6 = 13 applications before deleting any files.

Explanation: According to the question, Nell gave some cards to John and still has 210 cards left. Therefore, she must have given 210 cards to Jeff."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 cards of other type (not specified). She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so she now has 55 cards of that type left. Since she didn't give any of her non-baseball cards to Jeff, she still has all 18 of those cards. Therefore, the difference between the number of baseball cards Nell had initially and the number she has left is 438 - 55 = 383. Subtracting the number of non-baseball cards she had initially gives us 383 - 18 = 26 as the number of baseball cards Nell has more than non-baseball cards."

Explanation: According to the passage, together Marco and his father collected 22 pounds of strawberries. Later, when they were returning home, Marco's father found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, the total weight of strawberries collected by both of them is 52 pounds or 30 pounds x 1.7 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound)."
"Response: 22 pounds (or 10 kg)
Explanation: According to the question, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds, and together with his father's strawberries, they weighed 37 pounds. Therefore, if Marco's strawberries account for 15 pounds, then his father's strawberries must account for 22 pounds (37 - 15 = 22)."

Since there were initially 43 children in the bus and 21 children remained in the bus afterward, we can write the equation: X + 43 = 64. Solving for X, we get X = 22. Therefore, 22 children descended from the bus at the stop."
"Response: 23
Explanation: Initially, there were 41 children in the bus. After some children got off at the stop, there are currently 18 children left in the bus. Therefore, there were 23 children more in the bus before they got off compared to now."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Initially, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus, leaving 11 children inside. Later, 6 new children got on the bus, bringing the total number of children to 16. Therefore, 6 children got on the bus at the stop."
"Response: 20
Explanation: Let X be the number of children who were initially in the bus. Since 63 children descended from the bus and only 14 children remained in it, we can write an equation: X - 63 = 14. Solving for X, we get X = 87. Therefore, 20 more children got into the bus than those who got off (i.e., 87 - 63 = 20)."
"Response: 40 - 12 = 28
Explanation: Initially, there were 36 children in the bus. When it stopped, 68 children got off and 40 children got on. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on is 28 (40 - 12)."
"Response: 38
Explanation: Initially, there were 22 children in the bus. Then, 40 more children got into the bus, so the total number of children in the bus was 62 (22 + 40). Finally, 2 children remained in the bus, so 38 children descended from the bus at the stop."
"Response: 54
Explanation: Let X be the number of children who were initially seated in the bus. Since 82 children got into the bus after it stopped and some got off, we can write an equation: X + 82 = 30. Solving for X, we get X = 54. Therefore, there were 54 more children who got into the bus than those who got off."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Initially, there were 23 children in the bus. Then, 24 children got into the bus, and some children got off the bus. Therefore, the final number of children in the bus is 8 less than the initial number, which is 23 - 8 = 15. So, 6 more children got off the bus than got on it."
"Response: 82 (or 83)
Explanation: Let X be the number of gâteaux made by the baker. Since he sold 51 gâteaux, we know that X - 51 = 133 (the total number of gâteaux). Therefore, X = 82 (or 83), since you cannot have a negative number of gâteaux."
"Response: 37
Explanation: Let X be the number of gâteaux sold by the baker. Since he has 13 left, we can write: X - 13 = 54 (gâteaux made) - (gâteaux sold). Solving for X, we get X = 37."
Response: 217 (gâteaux)
"Response: 15 - 140 = -125
Explanation: The baker made 155 gâteaux in total. If his friend buys 140 of them, then he will have -125 gâteaux left (since -125 is the difference between the number of gâteaux the friend bought and the total number of gâteaux made)."
Response: 36 (gâteaux)
"Response: 4 (or 4 gâteaux)
Explanation: The question states that the baker made 13 gâteaux and sold 91 of them. This means he has 40 gâteaux left (13 - 91 = 40). Then, the question states that he bought 154 new gâteaux. So, the difference between the number of gâteaux he bought and the number he sold is 154 - 91 = 63. Therefore, the baker has 40 + 63 = 103 gâteaux in total."
Response: 92 (or 92 gâteaux)
"Response: 43
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 110 gâteaux (cookies) in total.
* He sold 75 of them.
* Then, he made 76 more gâteaux.

So, the number of gâteaux the baker has left is:
110 - 75 = 35
Adding the additional 76 gâteaux he made later gives us:
35 + 76 = 111
Therefore, the baker has 111 gâteaux left."
"Response: 30 (or 30 gâteaux)
Explanation: Let X be the number of gâteaux made by the baker initially. Since he sold 71 gâteaux, we know that X - 71 = 144 (the total number of gâteaux made). Then, after making additional 111 gâteaux, the new total is X + 111 = 255 (since there are now more gâteaux than before). Therefore, the difference between the number of gâteaux made and those sold is 255 - 71 = 184 gâteaux. So, the baker has made 30 more gâteaux than those he sold."
"Response: 59
Explanation: Let X be the number of gâteaux made by the baker. Since he sold 10 gâteaux, we have:
X - 10 = 149 (gâteaux left)
We also know that he made 91 pâtisseries and sold 90 of them:
X + 91 - 90 = 59 (pâtisseries left)
Therefore, the baker has 59 gâteaux left."
"Response: 39
Explanation: Let X be the number of pâtisseries made by the baker. We know that the baker has sold 15 gâteaux and 103 pâtisseries, so the total number of pâtisseries he has left is:
X - 15 - 103 = 39
Therefore, the baker has 39 pâtisseries left."
"Response: 11 (gâteaux) - 8 (pâtisseries) = 3
Explanation: The difference between the number of gâteaux sold and the number of pâtisseries sold is equal to the total number of gâteaux made by the boulanger minus the total number of pâtisseries made by him. Therefore, the boulanger has made 3 more gâteaux than pâtisseries."
"Response: 43 (p) - 26 (g) = 17
Explanation: The difference between the number of pastries and breads sold is equal to the total number of pastries made minus the total number of breads made. In this case, the boulanger made 131 pastries and sold 88, so he must have made 43 more pastries than he did breads."
Response: 10 (gâteaux) - 3 (pâtisseries) = 7 more gâteaux sold than pâtisseries.
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 54 gâteaux and 143 pâtisseries. If he sold 68 gâteaux and 92 pâtisseries, then he sold 50 more pâtisseries than gâteaux."
"Response: 4 - (Initial number of gâteaux) = 4 - 48 = -44
Explanation: If the baker had initially made 48 gâteaux and sold 44, then he would have still had 4 - 48 = -44 gâteaux left."
Response: 32 (gâteaux)
"Response: 32
Explanation: If l'ami du boulanger had initially bought 169 gâteaux and then bought 137 more from the baker, that means he has 169 + 137 = 306 gâteaux in total. So, the baker still has 63 gâteaux (306 - 137 = 63)."
"Response: 94
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 173 gingerbread cookies.
* He bought 103 new gingerbread cookies and sold 86 of them.

So, the number of gingerbread cookies the baker has left is:

New gingerbread cookies - Sold gingerbread cookies = 103 - 86 = 94

Therefore, the baker has 94 gingerbread cookies left."
Response: 38 (the difference between the number of gâteaux bought and sold)
"Response: 6
Explanation: The difference between the number of gâteaux sold (145) and the number of gâteaux bought (8) is equal to 6."
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 62 gâteaux initially.
* He then made 149 more gâteaux.
* He sold 144 gâteaux.

So, the number of gâteaux the baker has left is:
62 + 149 = 211 - 144 = 70
Therefore, the baker has 8 gâteaux left."
"Response: 53
Explanation: Let X be the number of gâteaux made by the baker initially. Since he sold 46 gâteaux, we know that X - 46 = 81 (gâteaux made). Then, to find out how many more gâteaux the baker made than those he sold, we subtract the number of gâteaux sold from the total number of gâteaux made: 81 - 46 = 53. Therefore, the baker made 53 more gâteaux than those he sold."
"Response: 253
Explanation: Let X be the number of gâteaux that the baker has left after selling 108 gâteaux and 44 pâtisseries. Since the baker made a total of 61 pâtisseries and 167 gâteaux, we can write:
X = 61 + 167 - (108 + 44)
= 61 + 167 - 212
= -94
Therefore, the baker has 253 gâteaux left."
"Response: 76
Explanation: The total number of pâtisseries made by the baker is given as 56 + 124 = 180. If he sold 104 gâteaux and 29 pâtisseries, then the number of pâtisseries he has left is:
180 - 29 = 151
Therefore, the baker has 76 pâtisseries left."
Response: 16 (gâteaux) - 32 (pâtisseries) = 16 more gâteaux than pâtisseries made by the baker.
Response: 8 (pastries - cakes)
"Response: 97 - 8 = 90
Therefore, the baker has sold 90 more gâteaux than pâtisseries."
"Response: 76
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 43 gâteaux and 114 pâtisseries. If he sold 154 pâtisseries and 78 gâteaux, then he sold 76 more pâtisseries than gâteaux."
Response: 96 games.
Response: 42 games will remain with Kelly if she gives 64 games.
"Response: 90
Explanation: According to the question, Kelly had initially 91 games and now has 92 games, including the 91 she already had. Therefore, the number of games Kelly had initially is 90 (91 - 1)."
Response: 30 games (Nintendo)
"Response: 90 games (Sony)
Explanation: To find out how many games Sony must give to Kelly so that she will have 31 left after giving her all of her Nintendo games, we need to subtract the number of Nintendo games she has from the total number of games she has. Since Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games, if she gives all of her Nintendo games away, she will be left with 132 - 46 = 86 Sony games. Therefore, Sony must give her 90 more games for her to have 31 left."
"Response: 49 games
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Kelly has already found 31 Nintendo games, which means she now has a total of 31 + 31 = 62 games. To determine how many games she will have left after buying 3 more, we need to subtract the number of games she bought (3) from the total number of games she has (62): 62 - 3 = 59 games. Therefore, Kelly should give $59 for the remaining 6 games."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of books in the series = 8
Number of films in the series = 10
Number of books read by the person = 19
Number of films watched by the person = 61
Now, let's find out how many more films are there than books in the series:
Total number of films = 10 (books) + 42 (films) = 52
So, there are 52 films more than the number of books in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 10 books and 11 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 13 books and watched 12 films, that means you have not read any of the additional 7 books (i.e., 10 - 13 = 7). Similarly, since you have watched 12 films out of 11, you have not watched any of the remaining 9 films (i.e., 11 - 12 = 9). Therefore, the difference between the number of books you have read and the number of films you have watched is 7 + 9 = 16."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 15 books and 14 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School."" If you have read 11 of the books and watched 40 of the films, then there are 3 more books than films in the series (15 - 11 = 4, and 14 + 3 = 17)."
"Response: 50 - 13 = 37
Explanation: There are 17 films and 11 books in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have read 13 of the books and watched 63 of the films, there are 50 films that you haven't seen (17 - 13 = 4) minus the number of books you haven't read (11 - 13 = -2), which is equal to 37 films more than books in the series."

Response: 17 dollars (51 dollars / 3 t-shirts)
Response: 360 dollars.
"Response: 127
Explanation: According to the passage, Razorbacks sold $106 for each T-shirt they sold. Since they sold a total of 242 T-shirts during both matches, the total amount of money they made is $242 x $106 = $25,382. If they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 127 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game ($25,382 - $115 = $24,267 / 2 = $12,133.50)."
Response: 80 dollars.
"Response: 78 dollars x 186 = $143.60
Explanation: To find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, that means they sold 186 - 172 = 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

"Response: 395$
Explanation:
Lewis will have to pay $702 in taxes, which means he will be left with $395 after paying his taxes. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of taxes ($702) from the total amount earned during the season ($21 x 216 weeks = $4480)."
"Response: 968,405 $
Explanation: To calculate how much money Lewis will earn over 73 seasons of farming, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of seasons he works. Since he earns $1357 per week and works for 223 weeks during each season, his total annual income is $296,333 ($1357 x 223). If he continues working for 73 seasons, his total earnings would be $968,405 ($296,333 x 73)."
Response: 5764 dollars per week during harvest season. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Lewis earns $28 per week for working 40 hours during the harvest season, which lasts for 10 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings during the harvest season are: $28 x 10 = $280. Additionally, he works overtime for an additional $939 per week, bringing his total weekly earnings to $280 + $939 = $1219 per week during the harvest season.
"Response: 16578$
Explanation: To calculate the total amount of money that Lewis Gagne earns during the harvest season, we need to subtract his weekly rent payment from his weekly income. According to the question, he pays $49 per week in rent, and he works for 233 weeks during the harvest season. Therefore, his total income during this period is:
Lewis Gagne's weekly income = $403 - $49 = $354 per week
His total income during the harvest season is therefore:
Total income = $354 x 233 weeks = $83,994
So, Lewis Gagne earns $83,994 during the harvest season."
Response: 47200 dollars (or $47,200)
"Response: 375000$
Explanation:
Lewis will have to pay a total of 491 x 1181 = 585,910 dollars in rent during the season of harvest. However, he is given a discount of 216 dollars per week, which means he will actually pay 564,080 dollars in rent. Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis will have 564,080 - 375,000 = 189,080 dollars left over."

"Response: 1 foot (or 12 inches)
Explanation: According to the question, the depth of the water is 10 times the height of Dean, which means that if Dean measures 9 feet tall, then the depth of the water is 90 feet (10 x 9 = 90). Since Dean measures 9 feet tall, this means that the difference in depth between him and the water is 81 feet (90 - 9 = 81)."
"Response: 16 feet (or 5 meters)
Explanation:
Dean measures 8 feet less than Ron, so Ron measures 14 + 8 = 22 feet tall. The water is twice as deep as Ron, so it is 2 x 22 = 44 feet deep."
"Response: 60 feet (or 72 inches)
Explanation:
Ron measures 12 feet tall, and the water is 5 times as deep as he is. So, if Ron is 12 feet tall, the depth of the water would be 5 x 12 = 60 feet (or 72 inches)."

Response: 5 packages of invitations are needed so that nobody is left out.
Response: 40 invitations (3 paquets x same number of invitations per pack).
Response: 35 invitations will remain unused.
"Response: 52
Explanation: The total number of invitations that Carol can invite her friends to is calculated as follows:
Total number of invitations in each pack = 14 (as stated in the question)
Number of packs purchased by Carol = 6 (also stated in the question)
Total number of invitations Carol can use = Total number of invitations in each pack x Number of packs purchased
= 14 x 6 = 84
Adding the additional 11 invitations she bought later gives us the final answer:
Total number of invitations Carol can use = 84 + 11 = 95
Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends to her party."

"Response: 2 (seats)
Explanation: According to the question, each seat can accommodate 9 people, which means that the total number of seats in the Ferris wheel is 9 x 2 = 18 seats. Since 18 people can mount the Ferris wheel at the same time, there are 18 seats in the Ferris wheel."
"Response: 380 people (19 seats per wheel x 15 people per seat = 285 people; multiplied by 2 to account for two wheels)."
Response: 60 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time. Explanation: The total number of seats available in the Ferris wheel is 18 (as stated in the question). If 10 seats are broken or unavailable, that means there are only 8 functional seats left. Since each seat can accommodate 15 people, we can calculate the maximum capacity as follows: 8 seats x 15 people per seat = 120 people. Therefore, 60 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.
"Response: 20 people can join the Ferris wheel.
Explanation: According to the question, each seat on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 14 people, and there are currently 16 people on the Ferris wheel. Therefore, if we want to find out how many more people can join the Ferris wheel, we need to subtract the number of people already on it from the total capacity of the seats. In this case, that would be 20 people (16 - 14 = 20)."
Response: 70 (2 x 14 = 28 + 23)

Response: 22 (Matthew had 2 biscuits x 11 friends = 22 biscuits)
"Response: 4 friends (or ""amis"" in French) received biscuits from Matthew. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response: 3 (biscuits per friend)
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 24 biscuits and gave an equal number of biscuits to his 3 friends. Therefore, he gave 8 biscuits to each friend. Since he has 17 biscuits left after giving them away, that means he gave a total of 8 x 3 = 24 biscuits to his friends."
Response: 2 (biscuits)
Response: 15 gâteaux each
"Response: 
Each person has eaten 3 biscuits and 3 gâteaux."
"Response: 2
Explanation: If Matthew had 36 biscuits and divided them equally among his 18 friends, each person would have received 2 biscuits (36/18 = 2)."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave 6 biscuits to each of his friends, so he gave a total of 6 x 5 = 30 biscuits. Since he had 36 biscuits initially, this means that he had 36 - 30 = 6 biscuits left after giving them away. Therefore, he gave biscuits to 6 friends."
Response: 4 biscuits each (friend)
Response: 8 biscuits
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let B be the number of biscuits given to each friend and G be the number of gâteaux given to each friend. Since Matthew gave an equal number of biscuits and gâteaux to his friends, we can write:

B = G = x (since he gave 4 friends x biscuits/gâteaux)

From the problem statement, we know that the total number of biscuits is 32 and the total number of gâteaux is 98. So, we can set up the equation:

B + G = 32... (1)
B × 4 = 98... (2)

Solving for B in equation (1), we get:

B = 8

And solving for G in equation (2), we get:

G = 76

Therefore, each person got 8 biscuits and 76 gâteaux."
Response: 2 gâteaux par ami.

Response: 1536 bouteilles (Debby had bought 1536 bottles of water)
Response: 9 bouteilles/day
Response: 190 bouteilles (264 - 15 x 11 = 190)
"Response: 28 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debby bought 301 bottles of water when they were on sale and consumed 144 bottles per day for several days. If she has 157 bottles left, that means she has been consuming water for 28 days (since 157 is greater than 144)."
Response: 20 days 
"Response: 7 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debby has 256 bottles of soda and she drinks 4 bottles per day. Therefore, it will take her 256/4 = 64 days for the soda to run out. However, since Debby also bought 200 bottles of water, which she drinks at the same rate as the soda, it will take an additional 64 days for the water to run out, making the total duration 64 + 64 = 128 days or 2 weeks."
"Response: 2 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debby buys 6 bottles of water per day. Therefore, if she has bought a total of 12 bottles of water, it means that she has enough water for 2 days (12 / 6 = 2)."
Response: 32 days 
"Response: 4 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debby has 162 bottles of water and 360 bottles of soda. If she drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, then the number of days the soda will last is calculated as follows:
Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles consumed per day
= 360 / 9
= 40 days
However, since Debby only has 162 bottles of water, she will run out of water after 122 days (since that is how many bottles she consumes per day). Therefore, the total duration of the soda will be 4 days less than the duration of the water, which is 39 days."
"Response: 156
Explanation: To find out how many crayons Faye has, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of crayons in each row. Since there are 14 rows and 11 crayons in each row, the total number of crayons is 14 x 11 = 156."
Response: 4 crayons in each row.
Response: 28/16 = 1 and 7/8 rangées.
Response: 22 x 6 = 132
"Response: 5
Explanation: Since each row has 5 crayons and there are 35 crayons in total, we can make 5 rows of 5 crayons each."
Response: 360 crayons (19 x 4 + 27)
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Faye placed 30 crayons of color in each row. Since there are 7 rows, the total number of crayons of color is 30 x 7 = 210."
"Response: 31 + 27 = 58
Explanation: According to the question, Faye placed 31 crayons and 27 crayons of color in each row, for a total of 58 crayons and crayons of color."
"Response: 6
Explanation: To determine how many rows Faye could make with 30 crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons in each row. Since there are 5 crayons in each row, we can divide 30 by 5 to get 6. Therefore, Faye could make 6 rows of crayons."
Response: 3 crayons in each row.
"Response: 9
Explanation: To determine how many rows Faye could make with her crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons in each row. Since there are 35 paquets of crayons and each packet contains 4 crayons, the total number of crayons is 35 x 4 = 140. Therefore, if Faye places two crayons in each row, she can make 140 / 2 = 70 rows."
Response: 31 x 6 = 186 crayons.
Response: 71 x 30 = 2130 crayons
"Response: 132
Explanation: According to the question, Faye has placed 16 rows of crayons with 6 crayons in each row. Therefore, the total number of crayons is 16 x 6 = 96 crayons. Since there are 21 crayons in each row, the total number of crayons of color is 96 x 21 = 1956 crayons. Finally, since some of these crayons may be duplicates (e.g., two red crayons), we subtract out the number of duplicate crayons (i.e., 48) to get the final answer of 132 crayons of color."
"Response: 98 / 7 = 14
Explanation: There are 98 students in total and 7 school buses available to transport them. Therefore, there will be 98/7 = 14 students per bus."
"Response: 84 x 118 = 9632
Explanation: The number of students in the school is equal to the product of the number of classrooms (84) and the number of seats available per bus (118). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of students by multiplying these two numbers together."
Response: 10 buses are needed to transport all the students. Explanation: Let X be the number of buses required for the trip. Since there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students, the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4282. If there are 6 seats in each bus, we need X + 6 = 4282 buses. Therefore, 10 buses are needed.
Response: 16 buses are needed to transport all the students during the school trip. Explanation: Let X be the number of buses required for the trip. Since there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has the same number of students (58), we can write: X = 58 / 87 = 0.66 buses per classroom. Since there are 2 seats available in each bus, we need: X × 2 = 134 buses. Therefore, 16 buses are needed to transport all the students during the school trip.
Response: 10 (students per class)
Response: 4 buses are necessary for the school trip. Explanation: Let X be the number of students who want to go on the field trip. Since there are 8 seats in each bus and 102 students in total, we can write the equation: 8X = 102. To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can fit in one bus: X/8 = 22. Therefore, 4 buses are necessary for the school trip.
"Response: 103
Explanation: The school has 102 classrooms and 11 students in total. Each bus can accommodate 99 students. If 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then 103 students will participate in the field trip (102 + 1 = 103)."
"Response: 40 buses are needed to transport all the students from school. 
Explanation: Let X be the number of buses required for the trip. Since there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 3 students, the total number of students is 72 x 3 = 216. Therefore, we need X buses such that 216 / X = 111, which gives us X = 40."
Response: 46 (bus capacity) x 50 (students per bus) = 2300 (total number of seats available for students).

"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 4 boys and Haley has 23 balls to share among them, each boy will receive 6 balls (23 / 4 = 6)."
"Response: 2
Explanation: If there are 13 boys who like playing with balls and 50 boys who like playing cards, then together they will receive 13 + 50 = 63 balls. Since Haley has 26 balls, each boy will receive 26 / 63 = 2 balls."
"Response: 10/3 = 3
Explanation: If Haley has 20 balls and there are 3 people in her class who like to play with balls, each person will receive 3 balls (since 20 / 3 = 6)."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, ""some boys"" in Haley's class like playing with balls. If there are 14 boys in total who like playing with balls and Haley gives 2 balls to each boy, then she has given a total of 28 balls (14 x 2 = 28)."

"Response: 2356
Explanation: According to the question, there are ""des bananes"" in Philip's collection of bananas, which implies that the collection is not empty. Moreover, since the bananas are organized into groups of size 187, we can infer that each group contains at least one banana (since 187 is greater than 0). Therefore, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is:

Number of groups = 140
Total number of bananas per group = 187
Total number of bananas = Number of groups x Total number of bananas per group
= 140 x 187
= 2356
Therefore, the answer is 2356."

Therefore, she had prepared cookies for 2 invitees."
Response: 420 cookies (14 x 30 = 420)
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Brenda's mother made cookies for 5 people and prepared 22 cookies in total. However, she had to throw away 17 cookies, which means that each person got fewer cookies than they were supposed to have. If each person had the same number of cookies, then the number of cookies each person received is equal to the total number of cookies minus the number of cookies thrown away, which is 22 - 17 = 5. Therefore, each person got 5 cookies."
"Response: 2
Explanation: If the mother of Brenda prepared 18 cookies and 9 invitees did not come, then each of the remaining 10 invitees received an equal number of cookies. Therefore, each invitee received 2 cookies (18 cookies / 10 invitees = 2 cookies per invitee)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, if each of the two guests had the same number of cookies as Brenda's mother made for them, then they would have 7 cookies each."

"Response: 58
Explanation: Let X be the number of bouteilles de soda ordinaire and Y be the number of bouteilles de soda diététique. Since there are 67 bouteilles de soda ordinaire and 9 bouteilles de soda diététique, we can write the equation: X + Y = 67... (1) Substituting Y = 9 in equation (1), we get: X + 9 = 67... (2) Solving for X, we have: X = 58. Therefore, there were 58 bouteilles de soda ordinaire more than the number of bouteilles de soda diététique."
Response: 39 bouteilles (61 - 22 = 39)
Response: 79 bouteilles (30 + 8 + 41 = 79)
"Response: 26
Explanation: The total number of bouteilles of soda is 79 + 53 = 132. Since there are more bouteilles of regular soda than dietetic soda, we can subtract the number of dietetic soda from the total number of bouteilles to get the number of regular soda. Therefore, the number of regular soda bouteilles is 132 - 53 = 80. So, they had 26 more bouteilles of regular soda than dietetic soda."
"Response: 83 - 54 = 29
Question: Un magasin d'alimentation avait 54 bouteilles de soda diététique, 83 bouteilles de soda ordinaire et 12 pommes. Combient de bouteilles de soda ordinaire hadt-il de plus que de soda diététique? "
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Total number of bouteilles = 17
Number of ordinary soda bottles = 9
Remaining bottles are dietetic = 4 + 5 (since there are 5 remaining after subtracting 9 from 17)
Therefore, the number of dietetic soda bottles is 4."
"Response: 40 - 19 = 21
Explanation: The number of bouteilles de soda ordinaire had is 60 - 19 = 41 more than the number of bouteilles de soda diététique."
"Response: 46
Explanation: The total number of bouteilles is 72 + 32 = 104. Since they have 78 apples, they have 104 - 78 = 26 more bouteilles than apples."
"Response: 12
Explanation: The number of bouteilles de plus had by the store is calculated as follows:
80 - 36 = 44 (bouteilles de soda régulier)
+ 54 - 36 = 18 (bouteilles de soda diététique)
Therefore, there are 12 more bouteilles than pommes in the store."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there were 30 bouteilles in total, of which 28 were regular sodas and the remaining 4 were dietetic sodas. Therefore, the number of dietetic sodas is 4."

"Response: 34 visitors (666 - 100 = 566; 566 - 100 = 34)"
Response: 398 visitors visited the palace of Buckingham the day before.
"Response: 471
Explanation: Let X be the number of visitors to the palace on that day. Since 829 people visited the palace in the previous 85 days, we can write:
X + 829 = 45 (since 45 people visited the palace the day before)
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 471 (since 471 is the difference between 829 and 45)"
"Response: 3062 (557 x 57)
Explanation: If there were 557 visitors to the palace of Buckingham on one day, and that number is multiplied by 57 days, then we get 3062 visitors in total over those 57 days."
"Response: 60 = 661 - 600
Explanation: If there were 600 visitors to the palace the day before and 661 visitors today, then the difference between the two days is 60 visitors (661 - 600)."
"Response: 528
Explanation: Let X be the number of visitors to the palace on the day in question. Since there were 92 visitors that day, we know that X - 92 = 419 (the difference between the total number of visitors and those who visited on the day in question). Similarly, since there were 103 visitors the day before, we can write X - 103 = 103 (the difference between the total number of visitors and those who visited the previous day). Now, solving these two equations simultaneously, we get X = 528. Therefore, the answer is 528 people had visited the palace before the day in question."
"Response: 365 (people)
Explanation: The information given in the passage is that there were 512 visitors to the palace of Buckingham on the day after 471 visitors came the previous day and 808 visitors came the day before that. To find out how many people visited the palace over the last 89 days, we can use the pattern established by the numbers provided: each day saw an increase of 101 visitors compared to the previous day. Therefore, if 471 visitors came on the day before that, then 572 visitors came on the day before that, and so on. Continuing this pattern, we get: 471 + 101 = 572; 572 + 101 = 673;...; 673 + 101 = 774;...; 808 + 101 = 909;...; 909 + 101 = 1010. In total, therefore, 365 × 89 = 30,195 people visited the palace of Buckingham over the last 89 days."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, 94 grape pickers filled 90 tonneaus of grapes in 6 days. To find out how many tonneaus are filled per day, we can divide the total number of tonneaus filled by the number of days taken to fill them: 90 / 6 = 15 tonneaus per day. However, since there were 94 grape pickers, we need to adjust this amount accordingly: 15 tonneaus per day x (94/90) = 2.5 tonneaus per day."

* You had 14 bags with an equal number of biscuits. (So you had 14 x Number of biscuits = 14x)
* You had 28 biscuits and 86 candies altogether. (So you had 28 + 86 = Total amount of sweets)
Now, we need to find out how many bags of biscuits you have based on the total amount of sweets:
Total Amount of Sweets = 14x + Total amount of sweets
Substituting the values, we get:
14x + 28 = 86
Solving for x, we get:
14x = 58
X = 4
Therefore, you had 3 bags of biscuits."

"Response: 30452
Explanation: According to the passage, during summer vacation, 61619 children in the county of Lawrence stayed at home while the others went to camp. The total number of children in the county is 91676. Therefore, the number of children who went to camp can be calculated as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Number of children who stayed at home = 91676 - 61619 = 30452 So, approximately 30452 children from the county of Lawrence went to camp."
Response: 509844 children (not including those from outside the county)
"Response: 632864 children (or 632,864)
Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
* 610,769 children from the county of Lawrence went to summer camp.
* Of these, 59,0796 stayed at home.
* Additionally, 22 children from outside the county attended the camp.
To find the total number of children in the county, we need to add the number who stayed at home and the number who attended the camp. Therefore, the answer is:
610,769 + 59,079 = 669,848
However, since some of these children may have been double counted (e.g., those from outside the county), it is best to round up to the nearest thousand to get an approximate answer:
669,848 rounded up to 632,864."

Response: 4 pommes
Response: 8 (Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie)
"Response: 10 - 9 = 1
Jackie has one more apple than Adam."
Response: 2 (Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam)
Response: 10 pommes.
Response: 16 pommes
Response: 30 pommes
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has 4 + 10 = 14 apples.
Together, Adam and Jackie have 2 apples.
So, if Adam has x apples, then he has 6 - x apples less than Adam and Jackie together.
Given that Adam has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, we can set up the equation:
x = 6 - (14 + 2)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 6 - 16
x = -10
Therefore, Adam has 8 apples."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has 5 + x apples. Since Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, she has a total of 89 + 11 = 100 fruit. Therefore, Adam has 5 + 100 = 105 apples."

Therefore, the total amount of money they gained by delivering newspapers is $25 ($45 - $20)."
"Response: 91 dollars
Explanation: Let F be the amount of money Fred earned during the weekend. Since he had $33 last week and earned $16 delivering newspapers, his total amount of money at the start of the weekend is $33 + $16 = $49. Then, he earned $74 washing cars, so his new total amount of money is $49 + $74 = $123. Therefore, Fred earned $91 during the weekend ($123 - $33)."

* If 64 serpents (not including alligators) are hiding, then the remaining number of serpents that are not hiding is:

156 - 64 = 92

Therefore, there were 31 serpents that did not hide."
Response: 57 alligators did not hide.
Response: 4 alligators do not hide.
"Response: 36 (or 35)
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Total number of animals in the cage = 79
Number of snakes hidden = 24
Number of alligators hidden = 51
Now, let's calculate the total number of animals that are not hidden:
Animals not hidden = Total number of animals - Number of snakes hidden - Number of alligators hidden
= 79 - 24 - 51
= 34
So, there were 34 animals that did not hide themselves in the cage.
Note: The question is ambiguous because it does not specify whether the ""animals"" mentioned in the last sentence refer to the same category as the ""snakes"" and ""alligators"" or if they are different categories altogether. Therefore, we have provided two possible answers: 36 or 35."
