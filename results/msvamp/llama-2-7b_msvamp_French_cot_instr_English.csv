Response:  Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. So, she played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is 8.
"Response:  On Monday (le lundi), Julia played with 11 children. On Tuesday (le mardi), she played with 12 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:

12 - 11 = 1

Therefore, Julia played with 1 more child on Tuesday than on Monday."
Response:  We know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday and added some more children to play with on Tuesday. So, let's say she played with x additional children on Tuesday. Now, we have a total of 5 + x children that Julia played with in all. Since the question asks about the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday, we can set up the equation: 5 + x = 15. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. Therefore, Julia played with 10 additional children on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with children on Monday and Tuesday. So, let's say she played with x children on Monday and y children on Tuesday. Since she played with a total of 16 children, we can write an equation: x + y = 16. Now, we are given that Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday, so we can substitute this value in the equation: x + 14 = 16. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 children on Monday.
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday and she added 12 more children to play with on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 28 children on Tuesday (Monday + Tuesday = 2 days). So, Julia played with 28 - 16 = 12 children on Tuesday.
"Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and she also played with 8 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday, then we can write an equation as follows:

Julia played with x children on Monday.
She played with 14 children on Tuesday.
So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and the number of children she played with on Tuesday is equal to 6 (14 - x).
Now, we are asked to find out how many children Julia played with on Monday. To do this, we need to isolate the variable ""x"" in the equation above. We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 14 - 6

Therefore, Julia played with 8 children on Monday."
Response:  Julia played with 17 children on Monday, 15 children on Tuesday and 2 children on Wednesday. So in total, she played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, in total she played with 15 + 18 = 33 children on those two days. Now we are asked how many children she played with on Monday and Tuesday combined. To find this out, we can simply add the number of children she played with on each day: 33 + 33 = 66 children. Therefore, Julia played with 66 children on Monday and Tuesday combined.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday, 9 children on Tuesday and 15 children on Wednesday. So, she played with a total of 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children. Therefore, she played with 10 children on Monday and Wednesday.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 2 children on Monday, and then she played with 14 children on Tuesday (Monday + Tuesday = 16). So, Julia played with 16 children in total. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 9 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday. So, the total number of children she played with on those two days is: 9 + 7 = 16. Now, we are asked how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To find this difference, subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 16 - 7 = 9. Therefore, Julia played with 9 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 14 children on Monday and 2 children on Tuesday. So far, she has played with 16 children. On Wednesday, she played with 8 children. To find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the total number of children she played with on Monday: 16 - 8 = 8. Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday and 9 children on Wednesday. So, she played with more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday (11 - 9 = 2). Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, she played with more than 15 children on both days combined. Now, let's consider Wednesday. She played with only 7 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday and the number of children she played with on Wednesday is 15 - 18 = -3 + 7 = 4. So, Julia played with 4 more children on Monday and Tuesday compared to Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with children on Monday and Tuesday, so she played with 13 + 10 = 23 children in total. Then, she played cards with 15 children on Wednesday, so the total number of children she played with is now 23 + 15 = 38 children. Therefore, Julia played with 38 children in total.
Response:  Julia played with children at chat on Monday and Tuesday, so she played with 7 + 13 = 20 children at chat in total.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. So, in total, she played with 12 + 14 = 26 children. Therefore, Julia has played with 26 children in total.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, she has played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. To find out how many children she played with more on Monday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with one child more on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (lundi), Julia played with 6 children. On Tuesday (mardi), she played with 5 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with 1 more child on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Monday and additionally with some more children on Tuesday. So, let's say she played with x more children on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of children she played with is 4 + x.
Response:  On Monday (Lundi), Julia played with 6 children. On Wednesday (Mercredi), she played with 4 children. So, we can say that Julia played with x - 6 = 4 children less on Wednesday than on Monday. Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. We know that x is greater than or equal to 0 because Julia did not play with any children on Tuesday (Mardi). Therefore, the solution is x = 2. So, Julia played with 2 more children on Wednesday than she did on Monday.
Response:  If Bobby had eaten some candy initially and then ate 25 more, that means he ate a total of 25 + initial amount = 43 candies. So, the initial amount was 18 (since 43 - 25 = 18).
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 28 bonbons initially and then he has eaten 42 more, so in total he has eaten 28 + 42 = 70 bonbons. Additionally, if he has also eaten 63 pieces of chocolate, that means he has eaten a total of 70 bonbons + 63 = 133 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby has mangé 133 bonbons.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby has eaten 33 bonbons initially. Then he added 4 more, so he had eaten a total of 37 (33 + 4) bonbons. Additionally, he ate 14 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, Bobby has eaten 51 items (37 bonbons + 14 chocolate).
Response:  We know that Bobby has eaten 38 bonbons initially and then he added 36 more. So, in total, he has eaten 74 bonbons (38 + 36). Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to one bonus, Bobby has eaten a total of 16 + 74 = 90 bonbons. Therefore, the answer is 90.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 20 bonbons and he ate 34 of them, so now he has 20 - 34 = -14 bonbons (negative because we are subtracting). Then, he ate 18 more bonbons, so now he has -14 + 18 = 4 bonbons left. So, Bobby has 4 bonbons left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 21 bonbons and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 21 - 5 = 16 bonbons left. Then, he ate 9 more bonbons, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 bonbons left. Therefore, Bobby has 7 bonbons left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 bonbons and he ate some of them. Then, he ate 5 more. So, at this point, he has eaten a total of 5 + 5 = 10 bonbons. Now, we are told that he still has 8 bonbons left. Therefore, the number of bonbons Bobby had initially is 8 - 10 = -2 bonbons.
Response:  If Bobby had 19 bonbons and he ate 2 of them, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 bonbons left. So, he has 17 bonbons remaining.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 bonbons and he has eaten some of them, then he must have fewer than 32 bonbons left. So, if he has 20 bonbons left, that means he has eaten 12 bonbons (32 - 20 = 12).
Response:  If Bobby had initially 36 bonbons and he ate 17 of them, then he has eaten 36 - 17 = 19 bonbons. After that, if he ate another 15 bonbons, then he has eaten in total 19 + 15 = 34 bonbons. So, Bobby still has 36 - 34 = 2 bonbons left.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 30 bonbons and he has eaten 23 of them, then he has 7 remaining (30 - 23 = 7). So, Bobby has 7 bonbons left.
Response:  We know that Allan had 5 balls and Jake had 3 balls in total. So, if we subtract the number of balls Jake had from the number of balls Allan had, we get:  5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Allan had 2 more balls than Jake at the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 balls and Jake had 3 balls at the park. So, Jake had 3 - 2 = 1 more balloon than Allan at the park.
Response:  If Allan has brought 2 balls to the park and Jake has also brought some number of balls (let's call it x), then the total number of balls that Allan and Jake have brought together is 2 + x. So, Jake must have brought at least 1 ball to the park. Therefore, the correct answer is x = 1.
"Response:  If Jake brought 6 balls to the park and he brought 4 more than Allan, then...
Jake brought 6 + 4 = 10 balls to the park.
So, Allan brought 10 - 4 = 6 balls to the park."
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balls to the park, then Jake brought x balls more than that. So, Jake brought (x + 5) balls to the park.
"Response: 
Allan had 3 balls at first and then bought 2 more. So he had 3 + 2 = 5 balls in total.
Jake had 5 balls to start with."
"Response: 
Allan had 2 balls initially and then bought 3 more at the park. So, he had 5 balls in total (2 + 3).
Jake had 4 balls initially.
So, the difference between the number of balls Allan had and the number of balls Jake had is 5 - 4 = 1.
Therefore, Allan had one more balloon than Jake at the park."
"Response: 
Jake had initially brought 6 balls to the park and then Allan bought 3 more balls at the park. So, Jake had 6 + 3 = 9 balls in total at the park after Allan arrived.
Therefore, Jake had 9 - 2 = 7 balls more than Allan at the park."
"Response: 
Allan initially brought 5 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, in total, Allan has brought 8 balloons (5 + 3) to the park."
"Response: 
Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 2 balloons initially. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, now Jake has 5 balloons (2 + 3).
Now, we need to find out how many balloons Allan had after Jake bought his additional balloons. We know that Allan had 6 balloons initially, and then he gave some of them away or lost them. But we don't have any information about it. So, let's assume that Allan still has all 6 balloons he had initially.
So, the final number of balloons Jake had is 5 (he already had 2), and the final number of balloons Allan had is 6. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons Allan had and the number of balloons Jake had is 6 - 5 = 1.
So, the correct answer is 1."
"Response: 
Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons initially. Then, Jake bought 4 more balloons at the park. So, Jake now has 3 + 4 = 7 balloons more than Allan at the park. Therefore, Jake had 7 more balloons than Allan at the park."
Response:  Allan gave 5 balls to the park and then Jake gave 6 balls to the same park. So, in total, there are now 11 balls (5 + 6) at the park. Then, Jake bought 3 more balls and added them to the existing ones at the park. Therefore, the final number of balls that Jake brought to the park is 11 + 3 = 14 balls.
Response:  We know that Allan had 3 balls and 20 balls in total, so he had 23 balls at the park (3 + 20). Now, we know that Jake had 5 balls and 59 balls in total, so he had 64 balls at the park (5 + 59). Therefore, the final answer is: Allan had 23 balls and Jake had 64 balls at the park.
Response:  We know that Allan had 7 balls and 5 balls, so he had in total 12 balls (7 + 5). Now we know that Jake had 6 balls and 4 balls, so he had in total 10 balls (6 + 4). Therefore, the number of balls that Allan and Jake had together at the park is equal to the sum of their individual numbers of balls, which is 12 + 10 = 22 balls.
Response:  If Allan has brought 5 balloons to the park and he is one person, then Jake must have brought at least 1 more balloon than Allan since they together brought a total of 6 balloons. So, Jake must have brought 6 - 5 = 1 balloon to the park. Therefore, Jake has brought 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balls to the park and then bought 3 more, he had a total of 5 balls at the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now, if Jake brought 6 balls to the park, that means he had 6 - 5 = 1 more ball than Allan at the park. So, Jake had 1 more ball than Allan at the park.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. So he spends a total of 8 hours per day studying languages (6 + 2 = 8).
Now, let's find out how many additional hours Ryan spends learning English compared to Chinese:
Additional time spent learning English = Total time spent learning English - Time spent learning Chinese
= 8 hours/day - 2 hours/day
= 6 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 6 hours more per day learning English than he does learning Chinese."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. So, he learns English for 6 hours + 7 hours = 13 hours per day. Therefore, he spends an additional 4 hours (13 - 9) per day learning Chinese compared to English.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 hours per day learning both languages combined. So, if he learns English for x hours per day and Chinese for y hours per day, we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 4... (1)
Since Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English, we know that x = 3. Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese. Substituting x = 3 into equation (1), we get:
y = 4 - 3 = 1... (2)
Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends x hours per day learning Chinese. Since he wants to spend 2 more hours per day learning English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 2 = 7... (1)
Now, let's solve for x in Equation (1):
x = 7 - 2... (2)
Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese and some additional time learning English, then he spends x hours learning English if he spends y hours learning Chinese. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 7 (since Ryan spends 7 hours in total learning both languages)
Now, according to the problem statement, if Ryan spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, we can rewrite the equation as:
x + y = 7... (1)
y = 5 - x ( since Ryan spends 5 hours less learning Chinese than English)
Substituting this expression for y into equation (1), we get:
x + (5 - x) = 7
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x = 4
Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours learning English."
Response:  If he spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day (day 1), he will spend 6 + 7 = 13 hours studying these languages. Now, if he studies for 5 days, he will study for a total of 5 x 13 = 65 hours. So, the answer is 65 hours.
Response:  If he spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day (24 hours), he spends a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours learning these two languages. Now, if he learns for 2 days, he will spend a total of 11 hours x 2 = 22 hours learning both languages. So, Ryan spends 22 hours learning English and Chinese altogether.
Response:  If he spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day (day 1), he will spend 5 + 4 = 9 hours learning these two languages. Now, if he continues this for 6 days, he will have spent 9 x 6 = 54 hours learning both languages together. So, the answer is 54 hours.
"Response:  If he spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day (24 hours), he learns for a total of 10 hours (4 + 6). Therefore, if he continues to learn for 86 days, he will have spent a total of 860 hours (10 hours/day x 86 days) learning both languages combined. So, his daily time spent learning each language is:
English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours
Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 512 hours"
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, so in one day he learns for 6 hours x 24 hours = 144 hours of English.
He also spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese and 3 hours per day learning Spanish, respectively. So in one day, he learns for 7 hours x 24 hours = 168 hours of Chinese and 3 hours x 24 hours = 72 hours of Spanish.
Therefore, in total, Ryan learns for 144 + 168 + 72 = 384 hours per day."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 3 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 6 + 6 = 12 hours per day and Chinese for 3 + 3 = 6 hours per day. Now, we are asked how many additional hours does he spend learning English compared to Chinese. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning Chinese from the total number of hours he spends learning English. So, 12 - 6 = 6 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 6 hours more per day learning English than he does learning Chinese.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. He also spends 4 hours per day learning Spanish. Therefore, he learns English for 7 + 2 = 9 hours per day, and he learns Spanish for 4 hours per day. So, the difference between the time spent learning English and Spanish is 9 - 4 = 5 hours per day.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. Therefore, he learns English for 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week and Spanish for 4 x 7 = 28 hours per week. Now, let's find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese. The question states that he spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese, which means he learns Chinese for 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week. Finally, we need to find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese compared to Spanish. To do this, we divide the number of hours he spends learning Chinese (35) by the number of hours he spends learning Spanish (28). This gives us a ratio of 35/28 = 1.25. So, Ryan spends 1.25 times more hours learning Chinese than he does learning Spanish.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and Chinese each day, then he learns English for x hours and Chinese for (3 - x) hours. Since Ryan spends 2 hours learning English every day, he learns Chinese for x = 1 hour per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour learning Chinese each day.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 x 7 = 28 hours learning English and 5 x 7 = 35 hours learning Chinese. So in total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours learning both languages.
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 bags of cans for recycling. If she found 7 more bags of cans on Tuesday, then the total number of bags of cans that Tiffany had on Monday is equal to the number of bags of cans she found on Tuesday minus 7. So, if we let X be the number of bags of cans that Tiffany had on Monday, then we can write an equation as follows:
X + 7 = 15 (since Tiffany found 7 more bags of cans on Tuesday)
Now, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
X + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7
This simplifies to:
X = 8
So, Tiffany had 8 bags of cans on Monday."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 7 bags of cans for recycling. If she found 12 more bags of cans on Tuesday, then she now has 7 + 12 = 19 bags of cans in total. So, she found 12 more bags of cans than she had on Monday.
Response:  If Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday and found some more on Tuesday, then she must have had 4 + x bags on Tuesday, where x is the number of additional bags she found. Since she had a total of 6 bags on Tuesday, we can set up the equation: 4 + x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2. So Tiffany found 2 additional bags of cans on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected x cans for recycling. The next day, she found an additional 4 cans. So, in total, Tiffany had x + 4 cans on Monday. Therefore, the answer is x = 4.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 10 bags of cans for recycling. The next day she found 3 more bags, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 bags. Then, on the third day, she found 7 more bags, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 bags in total. Therefore, Tiffany had 20 bags of cans at the end.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans for recycling. On Tuesday (day 2), she found an additional 10 bags of cans, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 bags of cans. On Wednesday (day 3), she found another 4 bags of cans, bringing the total to 18 + 4 = 22 bags of cans. Therefore, after Monday, Tiffany had found a total of 22 bags of cans.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 3 bags of cans for recycling. The next day, she found an additional 7 bags of cans and 44 bags of bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans.
"Response:  There are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples there are than green apples, we need to subtract the number of green apples from the number of red apples:

17 - 16 = 1
So, there is one more red apple than green apple in the basket."
Response:  There are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 11 (green) - 5 (red) = 6. So, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
"Response:  If there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the basket, then the total number of apples in the basket is 10 + x, where x is the number of green apples. Since we know that the total number of apples in the basket is 15, we can set up the equation:

10 + x = 15

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 5

So, there are 5 green apples in the basket."
Response:  If there are 3 red apples and some green apples in the basket, then there must be more than 3 green apples in the basket because we know that there are 10 more green apples than red apples. So, if there are x green apples in the basket, then there are 7 (x - 3) red apples in the basket. Therefore, the total number of apples in the basket is 7 + x = 10. Since there are 10 apples in the basket, we can conclude that there are x = 3 green apples in the basket.
Response:  There are 7 red peaches, 15 yellow peaches and 8 green peaches in the basket. So, there are a total of 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 peaches in the basket.
Response:  There are 7 red apples and 3 more than that number of yellow apples (7 x 3 = 21). So there are 21 yellow apples in total. Now, we know that among these apples, there are 8 green apples. Therefore, the number of green apples is equal to the number of yellow apples minus the number of red apples (21 - 7 = 14). So, there are 14 green apples in the basket.  
Response:  There are 14 pêches vertes in total and 6 pêches jaunes. So there are 8 more pêches vertes than pêches jaunes (14 - 6 = 8). Therefore, there are 8 more pêches vertes than pêches jaunes in the basket.
"Response:  There are 19 red apples and 11 yellow apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples there are than yellow apples, we can subtract the number of yellow apples from the number of red apples:

19 - 11 = 8

So, there are 8 more red apples than yellow apples in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. So, the total number of apples in the basket is 6 + 16 = 22. Therefore, there are 22 red and green apples in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Red Apples = 18
Yellow Apples = 14
Now, let's add both equations together to find out how many total apples are in the basket:
Total Apples = Red Apples + Yellow Apples
= 18 + 14
= 32
Therefore, there are 32 apples in the basket, including 18 red ones and 14 yellow ones."
Response:  If there are 14 yellow apples and 6 green apples in the basket, then we have a total of 20 apples (14 + 6 = 20). So, there are 20 apples in the basket.
Response:  Each panier has 65 bags of apples. Since each bag contains 7 red apples and 3 green apples, there are in total... (do calculations)...red apples and green apples in each panier.
Response:  There are 11 baskets of fruit in total. Each basket has 10 red apples and 18 green apples. So, if we multiply the number of red apples by 10, we get 100 red apples. And if we multiply the number of green apples by 18, we also get 180 green apples. Therefore, there are 100 + 180 = 280 apples in total.
Response:  There are 6 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 16 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So, in total, there are 6 x 16 = 96 red peaches and 6 x 18 = 108 green peaches. Therefore, there are 96 + 108 = 204 peaches in total.
Response:  There are 7 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. So, in total, there are 7 x 10 = 70 red peaches and 7 x 2 = 14 green peaches. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 peaches in all the baskets combined.
"Response:  If there are 7 pêches in all baskets, and each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of red peaches. Since each basket has 4 red peaches, the total number of red peaches is 4 x (number of baskets). So, if there are n baskets, the total number of red peaches is 4n.

Step 2: Calculate the number of green peaches. Since each basket has 3 green peaches, the total number of green peaches is 3 x (number of baskets). So, if there are n baskets, the total number of green peaches is 3n.

Step 3: Find out how many baskets there are. Based on the problem statement, there are baskets of peaches. Therefore, the total number of baskets is 7 / 4 = 1 3/4 baskets.

Step 4: Use the information from steps 1 to 3 to find the answer. The total number of red peaches is 4(1 3/4) = 5 3/4 red peaches. Similarly, the total number of green peaches is 3(1 3/4) = 4 3/4 green peaches.

Therefore, there are 5 3/4 baskets of red peaches and 4 3/4 baskets of green peaches."
"Response:  If there are 2 baskets of apples and each basket has 4 red apples and some green apples, then...
Step 1: Total number of apples in both baskets = Number of red apples + Number of green apples
= 8 (red) + x (green)
where x is the number of green apples in one basket.
Step 2: Since there are 12 apples in total, we can write an equation based on this information:
Number of red apples + Number of green apples = 12
Now let's substitute the values from Step 1 into this equation:
8 (red) + x (green) = 12
Simplifying the equation:
8x + x = 12
Combine like terms:
9x = 12
Divide both sides by 9:
x = 1
So, there are 1 green apple in each basket."
Response:  If there are 16 fruits in the basket and 13 of them are red, then there are 3 fruits that are not red (since 16 - 13 = 3). Since some of these non-red fruits may be green, we can assume that there are at least 2 green fruits in the basket (since 3 / 2 = 1.5). So, there must be at least 1.5 green fruits in the basket. Therefore, there are at least 1.5 green fruits in the basket.
Response:  Each basket contains 19 red grapes and 4 green grapes. So, if there are 15 baskets, then... (19 x 15) = 285 red grapes + (4 x 15) = 60 green grapes. Therefore, in total, there will be 285 + 60 = 345 grapes in all the baskets.
"Response:  If there are 10 pêches in total and each panier contains 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of red peaches. There are 10 pêches in total, and each panier contains 4 red peaches, so...
Number of red peaches = 10 x 4 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the number of green peaches. There are 10 pêches in total, and each panier contains 6 green peaches, so...
Number of green peaches = 10 x 6 = 60

So, there are 40 red peaches and 60 green peaches in total. Since we know that each panier contains both red and green peaches, we can conclude that there are 40/2 = 20 paniers of peaches."
Response:  There are 6 green apples and 2 red apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 6 (green) - 2 (red) = 4 more green apples. So, there are 4 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  If Jerry had initially 4 figurines of action on his shelf, and later added some more, then he has altogether 8 figurines of action on his shelf now. So, he must have added 4 new figurines to the existing ones (4 + 4 = 8).
Response:  If Jerry had initially 5 figurines of action on his etagere and later added 7 more, then he has now 12 figurines of action on his etagere (5 + 7 = 12). So, Jerry had initially 5 figurines of action on his etagere.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 figurines of action and 22 books on his shelf. So there were altogether 4 + 22 = 26 items on the shelf. Later, he added 6 more figurines of action to the shelf, so now there are 26 + 6 = 32 items on the shelf in total. Therefore, there were 32 figurines of action on Jerry's shelf at the end.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 figurines and 9 books on his shelf. So there were 5 + 9 = 14 items in total. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 14 + 7 = 21 items in total. Therefore, there are 7 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, now there are 2 + 4 = 6 action figures in total on the shelf. Now, let's count how many books are left. We know that at first, Jerry had 10 books, so after adding 4 new action figures, there should be 10 - 6 = 4 books remaining on the shelf. Therefore, there were 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf. Answer: 4.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 books on his shelf. Later, he added 10 more books to that number. So, in total, there were 9 + 10 = 19 books on Jerry's bookshelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 figurines of action and 2 books initially. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf, so now there are 6 books in total (including the initial 2). Therefore, the number of figurines of action is still 7 - 6 = 1. So, there were 1 more figure than book on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 figurines and 2 books, so there were 7 items in total (5 + 2 = 7). Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf, bringing the total number of items to 16 (7 + 9 = 16). Therefore, there are 9 more books than figurines on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 figurines of action on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more and took away 5 old ones. So, in total, there were 8 + 4 - 5 = 7 figurines of action on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 figurines of action on his shelf in his room. Then he added 4 more figurines and took some away from the old ones. So, if there are now 6 figurines of action on the shelf, that means Jerry has taken 3 - 6 = -3 figurines of action off the shelf. Therefore, Jerry has taken 3 figurines of action off the shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 figurines of action initially on his shelf. Later, he added some more and took away 10 of the old ones. So, there are now 8 figurines of action on the shelf. To find out how many new figurines he added, we can subtract the number of old ones he took away from the total number of figurines on the shelf now. Therefore, the answer is 8 - 10 = 2 new figurines of action that Jerry added to the shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had some action figures on an shelf in his room initially. Later, he added two more and removed seven of the old ones. So, if there are now ten action figures on the shelf, we can deduce that Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf initially (the number he added minus the number he removed). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 9 figurines of action initially and later added 7 more. So, in total, he has 9 + 7 = 16 figurines of action on his etagere. Now, we are told that there were also 10 books on the same etagere. Therefore, the number of figurines of action is greater than the number of books by 16 - 10 = 6.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures initially. So, there were 3 + 4 = 7 items in total on his shelf. Later, he added 2 more action figures, so now there are 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. Therefore, there are 9 - 3 = 6 action figures more than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf. So there were 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 10 + 2 = 12 items in total. Therefore, there are 12 - 7 = 5 books more than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  We know that initially there were only two birds sitting on the fence (the first two). Then, other birds came to join them (the third and fourth birds), so now there are six birds in total on the fence. Therefore, we can say that four additional birds came to sit on the fence after the initial two birds.
Response:  If there were initially x birds sitting on the fence, and then 4 more birds came to join them, then the total number of birds on the fence is x + 4. So, the answer is x = 3.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 4 oiseaux and 46 cigognes sitting on the fence. Then, 6 other birds came to join them. So, in total, we have:

Oiseaux = 4 + 6 = 10
Cigognes = 46 - 6 = 40

So, altogether, there are 10 oiseaux and 40 cigognes sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have 3 birds and 2 crows initially. Then, 5 other birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds sitting on the fence. And there are still 2 crows present, so the total number of birds and crows sitting on the fence is 8 + 2 = 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 crows initially. Then, 2 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 5 birds (3 initial + 2 new) and still 4 crows. Therefore, there are 5 oiseaux (birds) more than crows sitting on the fence. Answer: 5 - 4 = 1
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 birds and 6 crows sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have 5 birds (including the initial 2) and 9 crows (including the initial 6). Therefore, there are 4 crows more than birds sitting on the fence. Answer: 4
Response:  We have 4 birds and 6 crows initially. Then, 2 more crows come to join them, making it 6 + 2 = 8 crows in total. So, there are 8 crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 crows initially. Then, 6 more crows come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds and 6 + 4 = 10 crows sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 7 birds and 10 crows sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We have:
* 6 oiseaux (birds)
* 3 cigognes (storks)
So far, we have a total of 6 + 3 = 9 birds and storks.
Then, two more storks come to join them, so now we have:
* 9 birds (including the original 6)
* 5 storks (including the additional 2 that came later)
Therefore, there are 9 - 5 = 4 more birds than storks sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have 4 birds and 3 crows initially sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more crows come to join them. So, in total, we have 4 + 6 = 10 crows sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 10 - 4 = 6 crows more than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 other birds came to join them, making it a total of 10 birds (6 initial + 4 new). Next, 8 storks arrived, bringing the total number of birds to 18 (10 + 8). So, the final answer is 18 birds are sitting on the fence.
"Response:  There are initially two birds sitting on the fence (let's call them bird A and bird B). Then, five other birds come to join them (so there are now seven birds in total). Additionally, four storks arrive (storks are not birds, but we will include them for simplicity). Therefore, the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is:
7 + 4 = 11.
So, there are eleven birds and four storks sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 oiseaux (birds) sitting on the fence. Then, 2 other birds and 6 crows came to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Now, among these 5 birds, how many are oiseaux? Answer: Among the 5 birds, only 3 are oiseaux, as mentioned in the question. Therefore, the number of crow is 5 - 3 = 2.
Response:  We have 5 cigognes and 3 birds already sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them. So, in total we have 5 + 3 = 8 birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there are initially 6 cigognes and 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have:

Cigognes = 6 + (3 x 1) = 9
Oiseaux = 2 + (3 x 1) = 5
So, there are 4 more oiseaux than cigognes."
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 6 crows and 2 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 11 - 3 = 8 crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can divide the number of pages in the first chapter by the number of pages in the second chapter: 48 / 11 = 4.36 (round to nearest whole number). So, the first chapter is approximately 4 times longer than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. So, we can say that the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book = 37 + 80 = 117 pages. 
Response:  Since there are 60 pages in the first chapter and there are a total of 93 pages in the book, then the number of pages in the second chapter is equal to 93 - 60 = 33 pages.
Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Pages in Chapter 1 + Number of Pages in Chapter 2 Now, according to the question, the second chapter contains 36 pages, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Total Number of Pages = Number of Pages in Chapter 1 + 36 Therefore, if we know that the total number of pages in the book is 67, we can solve for the number of pages in the first chapter using algebraic manipulation: Number of Pages in Chapter 1 = Total Number of Pages - Number of Pages in Chapter 2 Number of Pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 Number of Pages in Chapter 1 = 31 So, the first chapter of the book contains 31 pages.
Response:  The book has three chapters with different page counts as follows: Chapter 1 - 66 pages Chapter 2 - 35 pages Chapter 3 - 24 pages Total number of pages = Number of pages in chapter 1 + Number of pages in chapter 2 + Number of pages in chapter 3 So, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages Therefore, the book contains 125 pages in total.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages and the second chapter has 23 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.
"Response:  The total number of pages in the book is given as 3 + 18 + 3 = 64 pages. So, we can write:
Second chapter length = Total pages - Third chapter length
= 64 - 3
= 61 pages
Therefore, the second chapter is 61 pages longer than the third chapter."
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. So, we need to find the difference between these two numbers. To do this, subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 53 - 21 = 32 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter contains 61 pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages. So, the book has 1931 pages in total.
"Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in total and each chapter has 23 pages, we can write:
Chapter 1 = 10 + 13 = 23 pages
Therefore, there are 23 pages in Chapter 1 of the book."
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter is 81 pages long. So, Chapter 1 has 81 pages. Now, we are asked how many pages are in Chapter 2. Since Chapter 2 makes up 68 pages of the book, we can say that Chapter 2 has 68 pages. Therefore, there are 68 pages in Chapter 2.
Response:  We know that 62 campers went for a morning canoe trip and 39 campers went for an afternoon canoe trip. So, in total, 62 + 39 = 101 campers went for a canoe trip. Therefore, there are 101 - 39 = 62 more campers who went for a morning canoe trip than those who went for an afternoon canoe trip.
"Response:  The number of campers who went for canoeing in the morning is given as 52. And the number of campers who went for canoeing in the afternoon is given as 61. To find out how many more campers went for canoeing in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for canoeing in the morning from the number of campers who went for canoeing in the afternoon:

61 - 52 = 9
So, there are 9 more campers who went for canoeing in the afternoon than in the morning."
Response:  We know that 15 campers went for a morning canoe trip and some other campers went in the afternoon. So, let's say x is the number of campers who went for an afternoon canoe trip. Since we want to find out how many campers went for an afternoon canoe trip, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for a morning canoe trip from the total number of campers who went for a canoe trip. Therefore, we have: Total number of campers = Number of campers who went for a morning canoe trip + Number of campers who went for an afternoon canoe trip. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total number of campers = 15 + x. Now, we are also given that the total number of campers who went for a canoe trip is equal to 32. So, we can set up the equation: 15 + x = 32. Solving for x, we get: x = 17. Therefore, 17 campers went for an afternoon canoe trip.
Response:  If some campers went in the morning and 7 more went in the afternoon, then the number of campers who went in the morning is equal to 60 - 7 = 53. Therefore, 53 campers went canoeing in the morning.
Response:  The number of campers who went canoeing in the morning is 36, and the number of campers who went canoeing in the afternoon is 13. So, the total number of campers who went canoeing = 36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, the answer is 49.
Response:  We know that 44 campers went to go kayaking in the morning, and 39 campers went to go kayaking in the afternoon. So, if we subtract the number of campers who went to go kayaking in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went to go kayaking, we get: 44 - 39 = 5. Therefore, 5 more campers went to go kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that 53 campers went in the morning, 48 campers went in the afternoon and 49 campers went in the evening. So, we have:
Morning: 53 + 48 = 101
Afternoon: 48
Evening: 49
Now, let's find out how many more campers went to the morning session than the evening session:
More campers in the morning: 101 - 49 = 52
Therefore, there are 52 more campers who went to the morning session than the evening session."
Response:  We know that 33 campers went in the morning and 34 campers went in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went in the afternoon is 34 - 33 = 1 more camper than those who went in the morning. Therefore, the number of campers who went in the evening is 10 + 1 = 11 campers.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went for canoeing in the morning and 59 campers went for hiking. So, the total number of campers who did not go for canoeing is 59 - 13 = 46. Therefore, the number of campers who went for canoeing is 21 + 46 = 67 campers.
Response:  We know that 29 campers went for kayaking in the morning and 66 campers went for hiking in the morning. So, the total number of campers who went for kayaking is 29 + 66 = 95. Now, we are told that 26 campers went for kayaking in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of campers who went for kayaking is 95 - 26 = 69. Hence, there are 69 more campers who went for kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 41 campers went for kayaking in the morning and 26 of them did it again in the afternoon. So, altogether they have done kayaking for 41 + 26 = 67 times.
"Response:  We know that 46 campers went for a canoe trip. Of those, 43 campers went in the morning and some other campers went in the afternoon. So, we need to find out how many campers went in the afternoon. To do this, let's use the information given in the question: ""Some other campeurs are allé(e)s faire du canoë l'après-midi."" This means that some number of campers (let's call it x) went for a canoe trip in the afternoon. Now, we have two pieces of information about these campers: they were not among the 43 campers who went in the morning, and they were part of the total group of 46 campers who went for a canoe trip. Using these two pieces of information, we can set up an equation: Total number of campers = Number of campers who went in the morning + Number of campers who went in the afternoon. Substituting the values we know from the question, we get: 46 - 43 = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, 3 campers went for a canoe trip in the afternoon."
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from an initial total of 7 apples, then there are now 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree. So, there remain 3 apples on the tree after Rachel picked her 4 apples.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 apples on the tree and now there are only 2 left. So, Rachel must have picked some apples. To find out how many she picked, we can divide the number of apples she had originally by the number of apples she has now. In this case, 4 / 2 = 2. Therefore, Rachel picked 2 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 ripe blackberries from her tree and now there are only 5 left. If 3 of them are ripe, then how many immature berries does the tree have? So, the answer is 2 (5 - 3 = 2).
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 mature apples from her tree and now there are 7 apples left on the tree. If 6 of them are mature, then the remaining apple must be immature. So, initially, the tree had 7 + 1 = 8 apples, out of which 6 were mature. Therefore, the number of mature apples the tree had at first was 6.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 6 mature apples from the tree. Now, there are 2 mature apples and 4 immature apples left on the tree. So, initially, the tree had 6 + 4 = 10 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 3 mature apples from the tree. So, the tree had 3 + 27 = 30 apples in total (mature and immature). Now, there are only 2 mature apples left on the tree, so initially, the tree must have had 30 - 2 = 28 apples. Therefore, the tree had 28 apples at the start.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. So, the number of apples on the tree before she picked any was 7 + 1 = 8. Then, two new apples grew on the tree after Rachel picked the original 7. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree now is 8 + 2 = 10. Hence, the tree had 10 apples at the start.
"Response:  We know that at first, there were 2 apples on the tree (the ""arbre de Rachel""). Then, Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree. So, after she picked them, there were 2 - 4 = 0 apples left on the tree. But then, 3 new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, now there are 0 + 3 = 3 apples on the tree."
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 apples from one of her trees and now there are 7 apples left on the tree. So, if she had picked none or only 1 apple, there would be 7 + 1 = 8 apples left on the tree. But since she picked 2 apples, there are actually 7 + 2 = 9 apples left on the tree. Therefore, the original number of apples on the tree was 9.
Response:  At first, there were 15 poms (3 x 5 = 15). Then, Rachel picked 8 from each of the three trees, so she got 24 poms (8 x 3 = 24). Now, there are still 9 poms left on all the trees, which means that initially, there were 33 poms (15 + 24 = 33) in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 7 apples from each of the 4 apple trees, so she has collected a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. Therefore, there are still 29 - 28 = 1 apple left on the trees. So, Rachel has collected a total of 28 apples.
Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more billes than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 19 billes more than Doug now, it means that Doug had x billes initially. Since Doug lost some balls at the playing field, he now has x - 3 billes less than what he initially had. Therefore, Doug has lost 3 billes. 
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Doug had x balls, Ed had x + 10 = 45 balls (since he has 45 balls in total). Now we are told that Doug lost 11 of his balls at the playing field. So, Doug now has x - 11 = 34 balls left. Therefore, Ed had 45 - 10 = 35 balls more than Doug at this point.
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more billes than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 22 billes and lost 7 of them at the playground, then he would have 15 billes left (22 - 7 = 15). Since Doug started with fewer billes than Ed, when Doug loses some billes, his remaining number will be lesser than Ed's. Therefore, Doug now has 9 billes (15 - 6 = 9).
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more billes than Doug initially. So, if Doug had x billes at first, then Ed had 5 + x billes. After losing 3 of his billes at the game field, Ed has 5 + x - 3 = 27 billes in total. Therefore, Doug had initialy x = 22 billes.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more balls than Doug initially. Then, Doug lost 27 balls at the playing field while Ed found 9 additional balls. So, if we subtract the number of balls Doug lost from the total number of balls Ed gained, we can find out how many balls Ed had more than Doug after all these events occurred.
Let E be the total number of balls Ed had (including the initial 24 more balls than Doug), and D be the total number of balls Doug had.
We know that E = D + 24.
Then, we know that D - 27 = E - 9.
Solving for E, we get:
E = D + 24 = (D - 27) + 9 = D + 13.
So, Ed had 13 more balls than Doug after all these events occurred."
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more balls than Doug initially. Then, he lost 17 of his balls at the game field. So, how many balls does Ed have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of balls he lost from the initial difference between him and Doug: 29 - 17 = 12. Therefore, Ed has 12 more balls than Doug now.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Ed has x balls now and Doug has y balls, we can write an equation:
x = 19 + y ( since Ed has 19 more balls than Doug)
Now, we are told that Ed lost some of his balls at the playing field. So, let's say he lost x balls. Then, we can update our equation as follows:
x - x = 19 + y
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
2x = 19 + y
Subtracting x from both sides gives us:
x = 10
So, Ed lost 10 balls at the playing field."
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 91 balls and lost 21 of them at the game field, he would have 70 balls left (91 - 21 = 70). Therefore, Ed has 30 + 70 = 100 balls in total, which is 30 more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Doug has x balls to start with, then Ed has x + 12 = 14 balls to start with (since he has 12 more). Now, Ed lost 20 of his balls at the game field. So, he now has 14 - 20 = -6 balls left. Since Ed had more balls than Doug, we can conclude that Doug must have gained some number of balls equal to the difference between their initial ball counts. Therefore, Doug now has x + (-6) = x + 6 = 12 balls.
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 42 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 408. Since there are more than twice as many students who suggested adding mashed potatoes compared to those who suggested adding bacon (i.e., 408 vs. 42), we can conclude that 816 students (twice 408) suggested adding mashed potatoes in total. Therefore, the answer is 816.
"Response:  If 479 students suggested adding potatoes and 489 students suggested adding bacon, then we can say that there are as many students who suggested bacon as those who suggested potatoes (i.e., 489). Therefore, the number of students who suggested bacon is equal to the number of students who suggested potatoes minus the number of students who suggested both bacon and potatoes. 
We know that no student suggested both bacon and potatoes, so the total number of students who suggested either bacon or potatoes is equal to the sum of these two numbers. 
So, the number of students who suggested bacon is equal to 489 - (479 + 489) = -10. 
Therefore, 10 students suggested bacon more than they did potatoes."
Response:  According to the question, out of 310 students, 185 suggested adding potato puree and 35 did not suggest any specific food item. This means that 185 - 35 = 150 students did not suggest adding bacon or any other food item. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 35. So, the answer is 35.
"Response:  According to the question, out of 288 students, 264 suggested adding bacon and some others suggested adding mashed potatoes. So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the answer is:
Number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes = 288 - 264 = 24
Therefore, 24 students suggested adding mashed potatoes."
Response:  According to the problem statement, out of 457 students who suggested adding specific food items to the cafeteria menu, 63 more students suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding bacon. This means that 63/457 = x/y, where x is the number of students who suggested adding bacon and y is the total number of students who participated in the survey. So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x = 457 - 63 = 394.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 182 students who suggested adding potatoes and 166 students who suggested adding bacon. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of students suggesting potatoes = 182
Number of students suggesting bacon = 166 - 182
= -16

Therefore, 16 students suggested adding bacon."
"Response: 
From the given information we know that:
* 324 students suggested adding potato puree to the menu.
* 374 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
* 128 students suggested adding tomatoes to the menu.
So in total, 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in suggesting new dishes for the menu."
Response:  According to the given information, there are 257 students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 120 students who suggested adding bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested adding bacon by 137 (257 - 120).
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 144 students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 79 students who suggested adding tomatoes. So, we can write this as follows:

Potatoes (144) > Tomatoes (79)

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested potatoes than tomatoes:

Number of students who suggested potatoes - Number of students who suggested tomatoes = 144 - 79 = 65

Therefore, 65 more students suggested adding potatoes to the menu than those who suggested adding tomatoes."
"Response:  The number of students who suggested adding bacon is 337. Since some students may have suggested both bacon and tomatoes, we will subtract the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes (23) from the total number of students who suggested adding bacon to get the difference between them. Therefore, the number of students who suggested more bacon than tomatoes is:

337 - 23 = 314
So, 314 students suggested more bacon than tomatoes."
Response:  We know that out of 450 students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu, 38 suggested adding bacon as well. So, in total, 450 + 38 = 488 students participated in suggesting new food items. Therefore, the answer is 488.
"Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 351 students suggested only adding bacon, then we can say that there are 569 (218 + 351) total suggestions for adding meat to the menu. Since ""du bacon"" is French for ""bacon,"" let's assume that all of these suggestions were for adding bacon specifically. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is equal to the total number of suggestions minus the number of students who suggested adding potatoes, which is 569 - 218 = 351. So, 351 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
"Response:  According to the given information, there are three options for food items that students have suggested adding to the menu: bacon, purée of potatoes, and tomatoes. We know that 269 students suggested adding bacon, 330 students suggested adding purée of potatoes, and 76 students suggested adding tomatoes. So, we can write this as:

269 + 330 = x (where x is the number of students who suggested adding purée of potatoes)
x + 76 = y (where y is the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes)
Now, we want to find out how many more students suggested adding purée of potatoes than those who suggested adding tomatoes. So, we can set up an equation based on these two equations:

x - y =? (where? represents the difference between the number of students who suggested adding purée of potatoes and those who suggested adding tomatoes)
Solving for x - y, we get:

x - y = 261 (since x = 330 and y = 76)
Therefore, there were 261 more students who suggested adding purée of potatoes than those who suggested adding tomatoes."
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, the school has 333 more girls than boys.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in total. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: 841 - 34 = 796. Therefore, the school has 796 more boys than girls.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more than boys, then the number of boys is equal to 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls, then the number of boys is 635 + 510 = 1145. So, there are 1145 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 281 more than boys, then the total number of students in the school is: 868 + (281 - x) = 1149 where x is the number of boys. So, the answer is 1149.
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, then the total number of students in the school is: 700 + (142 - 70) = 912. Therefore, there are 912 students in this school.
Response:  The initial number of girls in the school was 706 and the number of boys was 222, so the total number of students initially was 706 + 222 = 928. Now, 418 additional girls have joined the school, so the new total number of students is 928 + 418 = 1346. Therefore, there are currently 1346 students in the school.
Response:  The initial number of girls in the school was 902. Then, 44 additional girls joined the school, so the new total number of girls is 902 + 44 = 946. Therefore, there are 946 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. So, the total number of students was 632 + 410 = 1042. Now, we are told that 465 additional girls have joined the school. Therefore, the new total number of girls is 632 (initial) + 465 = 1097. Since the number of boys remains unchanged at 410, the difference between the number of girls and boys is: 1097 - 410 = 687. So, there are 687 more girls than boys in the school now.
"Response:  The initial number of girls in the school is 732. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls now is:
732 + 682 = 1414
Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school currently."
Response:  The initial number of boys in the school is 214. Then, we are told that 496 more girls joined the school, so the total number of students in the school now is 214 + 496 = 710. Since there are already 214 boys in the school, the number of new boys who have joined the school is 710 - 214 = 506. Therefore, there are currently 506 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Additionally, we know that there are 36 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 626 / 36 = 17.5.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers to this total. There are 772 teachers in the school, so we add them to the total: 624 + 772 = 1396. So, there are 1396 people in this school.
"Response:  If there are 402 more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of girls. So, if there are 739 girls, the number of boys must be:

(Total number of students - Number of girls) / 2 = (739 - 402) / 2 = 337

Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school."
"Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of girls. So, if there are 692 girls, the number of boys must be:

(Total number of students - Number of girls) / 2 = (692 - 458) / 2 = 234

Therefore, there are 234 boys and 458 girls in the school."
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 362 + 257 = 619. If 403 additional girls joined the school, then the new total number of girls would be 619 + 403 = 1022. Since we know that there are more girls than boys in the school, this means that the number of boys in the school has decreased by an amount equal to the difference between the total number of girls and the original number of boys. So, the number of boys in the school after the addition of the 403 girls is: 362 - (1022 - 362) = -660. Therefore, there are 660 fewer boys than girls in the school.
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. So, Edward now has $2.
Response:  If Edward had $13 and he spent some money, then he has less money now. So, if he has $3 now, that means he spent $10. Therefore, Edward spent $10.
"Response:  We know that Edward spent $9 initially and then he spent $8 more. So, in total, he has spent $9 + $8 = $17. Now we want to find out how much money Edward had before spending any amount. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that ""Edward a dépensé 9 dollars."" This means that Edward had $9 - $9 = $0 dollars before spending any amount. Therefore, the correct answer is $0."
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so he paid $0.18 per book ($16 / 92). Now we are told that he has $6 left after buying the books. So, before spending his money, Edward had $6 + $0.18 x 92 = $6 + $17.04 = $23.04. Therefore, Edward had $23.04 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, so he paid $6 / 2 = $3 per book. Therefore, each book costs $3.
Response:  Before spending money on books and pens, Edward had X dollars. He spent 6$ on books and 16$ on pens, so he has less money now. Therefore, Edward had X - 22 = 19$ before spending his money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $4 for books and $3 for pens. So he has $4 + $3 = $7 left after buying both. Therefore, Edward spent $7 for the books and pens combined.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he has $19 left after buying both. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had left: $19 - $8 = $11. Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Before spending $17, Edward had $X dollars. Now he has $X - $10 = $7 dollars left. So, Edward had $X = $7 + $17 = $24 dollars before spending his money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups in the gym today and David did more than Zachary. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 44. Now, we are told that David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary. This means that David did (x + 58) push-ups in total. Therefore, the answer is (x + 58).
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 push-ups and David has done 44 push-ups in total today at the gym. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Zachary's number of push-ups - David's number of push-ups = Total difference in push-ups
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:
51 - 44 = 7
So, Zachary has done 7 more push-ups than David. Therefore, the answer is 7."
Response:  We know that David made 44 push-ups in total today at the gym. And we also know that David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did 44 - 9 = 35 push-ups more than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups in total.
Response:  We know that David made 51 push-ups in the gym today and he did 49 more than Zachary. So, Zachary made 51 - 49 = 2 push-ups. Therefore, David made 51 + 2 = 53 push-ups in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 chest presses and 44 crunches at the gym today. So, we can write this as Z = 59 + 44. Now, we are told that David did 19 more chest presses than Zachary, so David did Z + 19 = 78 chest presses. However, David also did 27 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did Z - 27 = 23 crunches. Therefore, David did 78 chest presses and 23 crunches at the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 chest presses and 17 abdominal exercises in total today at the gym. So he did more abdominal exercises than chest presses. Now we are told that David did 29 more chest presses than Zachary. This means that David did 29 - 44 = 15 chest presses less than Zachary. But we also know that David did 13 fewer abdominal exercises than Zachary. Therefore, David did 13 - 17 = -4 abdominal exercises. So David did no abdominal exercises today at the gym.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 53 chest presses and 14 abdominal exercises in total today at the gym. Since David did 17 more chest presses than Zachary, we can say that David did 53 + 17 = 70 chest presses. However, since David did 10 fewer abdominal exercises than Zachary, David did 14 - 10 = 4 abdominal exercises. Therefore, Zachary did 53 chest presses and 4 abdominal exercises in total today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in the gym today. David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, which means he did 58 + 35 = 93 push-ups. However, David did 87 fewer crunchs than Zachary, which means he did 3 - 87 = -84 crunchs. So, Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunchs, while David did 93 push-ups and -84 crunchs.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 58 abdominal crunches and 46 push-ups in his workout today. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary but 62 fewer abdominal crunches than him. So, if we subtract the number of abdominal crunches that David did from the total number of abdominal crunches done by Zachary, we will get the difference between their numbers of abdominal crunches. Therefore, the answer is:
Zachary has done 90 - 62 = 28 additional abdominal crunches compared to David."
"Response:  We know that David has done more than Zachary because he is mentioned as having done 39 more pompes than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x pompes, then David did x + 39 pompes. 
We also know that John did fewer pompes than David because he did 13 less than David. So, if David did x + 39 pompes, then John did x - 13 pompes. 
Now we can substitute these values in the equation to solve for x: x = 19 (since Zachary did 19 pompes). Therefore, David did 48 pompes (x + 39) and John did 16 pompes (x - 13)."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in the gym today. David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Since John did 4 fewer than David, John did 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John did 69 push-ups today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 15 push-ups in total today. David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 54 push-ups (39 + 15). John did 9 fewer push-ups than David, so John did 45 push-ups (54 - 9 = 45). Therefore, Zachary did 15 + 45 = 60 push-ups more than John.
Response:  We know that David made 37 pompes more than Zachary did. So if Zachary made x pompes, then David made 37 + x pompes. Therefore, we can write the equation: David = 37 + x. Now we are given that David made 30 more pompes than Zachary. This means that Zachary made x - 30 pompes. Substituting this value into our equation, we get: David = 37 + (x - 30). Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Zachary made 20 pompes.
Response:  We know that David made 56 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x pomps, David did 56 + x = 102 pomps. Now we are told that David did 38 pomps. Therefore, Zachary did 64 pomps (102 - 38).
Response:  We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 sit-ups, then David did 34 + 40 = 74 push-ups and 62 - 17 = 45 sit-ups.
Response:  According to the question, David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 sit-ups, then Zachary did 21 (58 - 33) more push-ups than sit-ups. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups and sit-ups that Zachary did is 21.
Response:  According to the question, David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 sit-ups, then Zachary did 20 (17 - 7) more sit-ups than David. Therefore, Zachary did 37 (27 + 20) more abdominal exercises than push-ups.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, in total, she had to complete 7 pages of homework (5 + 2 = 7). Therefore, Rachel had 7 - 2 = 5 more pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, in total, she had to complete 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework. Therefore, she had 7 - 3 = 4 pages of reading comprehension homework left over after completing her math homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework and more than 7 pages of reading assignments, then she needs to complete at least 7 + x pages of reading assignments, where x is the number of pages that are more than 7. Since there are 7 pages of reading assignments in total, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 5 + x, which simplifies to 2x = 3. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 3 pages of reading assignments.
"Response:  If Rachel has to complete 7 pages of math homework and she needs to do 4 more pages than her reading comprehension homework, then we can write an equation as follows:

Math homework = 7 pages
 Reading comprehension homework = Math homework + 4 pages

Now, we know that Rachel has to complete 11 pages of homework in total (7 pages for math + 4 pages for reading comprehension). So, we can set up another equation:

Total homework = Math homework + Reading comprehension homework
Total homework = 11 pages

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

Math homework = 7 pages
Reading comprehension homework = 4 pages

Therefore, Rachel should complete 4 pages of reading comprehension homework."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework initially, and she needs to add 3 more pages than her reading assignment, then the total number of pages she has to complete is:
8 + (3 - 1) = 8 + 2 = 10 pages.
Therefore, Rachel has to complete 10 pages of math homework in total."
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework and she also needs to do 6 additional pages of reading comprehension, then she needs to complete 14 pages of work in total (8 + 6 = 14). Therefore, Rachel should complete 14 pages of reading comprehension.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 10 pages of math homework and she needs to do an additional 3 pages of reading comprehension, then in total she needs to complete 10 + 3 = 13 pages of work. Therefore, the answer is 13 pages.
Response:  Rachel has to complete 2 pages of math homework, which means she needs to write down 40 questions and answers (since each page typically contains about 20 questions). Then, she has to read 3 pages of text for her literature class, which means she needs to underline or highlight important information in about 90 sentences (assuming an average sentence length of 15 words per sentence). Finally, she has to do 10 additional pages of biology homework, which means she needs to write down about 200 scientific terms or concepts (again assuming an average length of 15 words per term). So, in total, Rachel needs to complete around 740 written tasks (40 + 90 + 200 = 740).
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she had to complete 9 + 2 = 11 pages of homework in total. However, we are also given that she had to complete 96 pages of biology homework. So, if she completed all her biology homework, then she would have 96 - 11 = 85 pages of remaining homework. Therefore, Rachel had 85 pages more of math homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework and 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, she had to complete 8 pages (11 - 3) more of math homework than biology homework. So, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and biology homework is 8 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading assignments. Therefore, she had to complete 7 + 11 = 18 pages of homework in total. Now, we are asked how many pages of reading assignments she had more than her biology assignments. So, if she had 8 pages of biology assignments, then she had 18 - 8 = 10 pages more of reading assignments.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she needs to complete a total of 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework in these subjects. However, we are also given that she has to complete 29 pages of biology homework. So, in addition to the 20 pages she already needs to complete in math and reading, she now needs to add another 29 pages for a total of 59 pages of homework.
Response:  Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework and 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, she needs to complete a total of 8 + 3 = 11 pages of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework and 10 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she needs to complete 15 pages of homework in total. Now, we are asked how many pages of reading comprehension and biology homework she needs to complete. Since each page of reading comprehension homework is worth 2 pages of biology homework (as stated in the problem), we can convert the number of pages of reading comprehension homework into equivalent pages of biology homework as follows: 10 pages x 2 = 20 pages of biology homework. So, Rachel needs to complete 15 + 20 = 35 pages of homework in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of mathematics. So, in total, she had to complete 6 pages of work (2 + 4 = 6). Therefore, she had 6 - 2 = 4 more pages of mathematics than reading comprehension.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension homework and 7 pages of mathematics homework. Therefore, she had to complete 4 + 7 = 11 pages of homework in total. Since she had 19 extra pages to complete, that means she had to complete an additional 19 - 11 = 8 pages of mathematics homework. So, Rachel had to complete 8 more pages of mathematics homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 in the afternoon, then he received a total of 8 emails (6 + 2 = 8). So, Jack has received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon. The answer is 8 - 2 = 6.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows:
Morning: 6 emails
Afternoon: 8 emails - 6 emails = 2 additional emails
Therefore, Jack received 2 extra emails in the afternoon compared to the morning."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 5 emails during the day. Since he did not receive any emails in the evening, we can conclude that all 5 emails were received during the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails in the evening. So, we can write down the total number of emails he received as follows:
Total = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14
Therefore, Jack received 14 emails during the day."
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 5 Emails Afternoon = 8 Emails Now, let's solve for the number of emails Jack received in each time period: Morning = 5 Emails ∴ Number of emails received in the morning = 5 x 100 = 500 Afternoon = 8 Emails ∴ Number of emails received in the afternoon = 8 x 100 = 800 Therefore, Jack received a total of 500 emails in the morning and 800 emails in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the afternoon and 8 emails in the evening. So, we can write:
Afternoon = 5 emails
Evening = 8 emails
Now, let's add both amounts to find out how many emails Jack received in total:
Total = Afternoon + Evening
= 5 + 8
= 13
Therefore, Jack received 13 emails in total - 5 in the afternoon and 8 in the evening."
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening, then he has received a total of 11 emails (3 + 8 = 11). So, Jack has received 11 emails in total - 5 in the morning and 6 in the evening.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write:
Morning = 10 emails
Afternoon = 7 emails
Now, we know that Jack received 17 emails in the evening. So, we can add this number to the total number of emails he received during the day:
Total = Morning + Afternoon + Evening
= 10 + 7 + 17
= 34 emails
Therefore, Jack has received 34 emails more in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Morning emails = 9
Evening emails = 7
Now, let's subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the morning to find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the evening:
Difference = Morning emails - Evening emails
= 9 - 7
= 2
Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the evening."
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails during the daytime. Now, we are asked how many more emails Jack received in the evening than in the afternoon. To find this difference, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the evening: 4 - 5 = -1. Therefore, Jack received one fewer email in the evening than he did in the afternoon.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening, but not all of them were after midnight. So, we can assume that he received at least 3 emails in the afternoon (since he received some more in the evening). Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is 3.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So in total, he received 67 messages (3 emails + 64 letters). Then, in the afternoon, he received 5 emails and 54 letters. Therefore, Jack received a total of 121 messages during the day (67 + 54 = 121).
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters, so he received a total of 11 messages (emails + letters). Then in the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 16 messages (emails + letters) during the day. Therefore, Jack received a total of 11 + 16 = 27 messages during the day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. Then he received 3 additional emails and 44 additional letters in the afternoon. So, if we subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the morning, we get:

10 - 3 = 7

So, Jack received 7 more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. So, in total, he received 6 + 8 = 14 messages. Then, in the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters. Therefore, the difference between the number of messages Jack received in the morning and the number of messages he received in the afternoon is: 14 - (2 + 7) = 5 messages. 
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in total and sent 91 letters in total during the morning. So, he received 6 + 91 = 97 emails in the morning. Then, we are told that he received 2 more emails after lunch and sent 74 letters. Therefore, he received 97 + 2 = 99 emails in total during the day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack sent 2 letters and received 4 emails. So in total, he had sent 2 + received 4 = 6 emails in the morning. Then in the afternoon, he sent 8 letters and received 6 emails. Therefore, in total, Jack had sent 6 + 8 = 14 emails during the day.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he must have received X emails in the afternoon. Since we know that the total number of emails Jack received is 9, we can set up an equation as follows: 7 + X = 9. Solving for X, we get: X = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 additional emails in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning. So, he received a total of 8 emails during these two time periods. Now, we need to find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning: 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and he received 6 emails in the morning, then he received a total of 9 emails during the day (3 + 6 = 9). So, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon (9 - 3 = 2).
Response:  The difference between the height of the jump made by the frog and that made by the grasshopper is equal to the distance traveled by the frog minus the distance traveled by the grasshopper. So we can write this equation: 12 - 9 = x, where x represents the distance traveled by the frog. Therefore, the frog has traveled 3 inches more than the grasshopper.
Response:  The sauterelle has jumped 31 inches and the frog has jumped 35 inches. So together they have jumped a total of 31 + 35 = 66 inches or 5 feet 6 inches (in imperial units).
Response:  The sauterelle has jumped 36 inches (pouces). Then, the grenouille has jumped 17 inches more than the sauterelle, which means it has jumped 36 + 17 = 53 inches. Finally, the souris has jumped 15 inches less than the grenouille, which means it has jumped 53 - 15 = 38 inches. So, the grenouille has jumped 38 inches.
Response:  The sauterelle jumped 25 inches (or 63 cm). Then, the frog jumped 18 inches more than the sauterelle, which is 25 + 18 = 43 inches (or 109 cm). Finally, the mouse jumped 2 inches more than the frog, which is 43 + 2 = 45 inches (or 114 cm). So, the mouse jumped 45 inches or 114 cm.
Response:  The sauterelle jumped 19 inches (pouces), the frog jumped 10 inches more than that (19 + 10 = 29 inches), and the mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog (29 + 20 = 49 inches). So, the mouse jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches more than the sauterelle. 
Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 19 inches (pouces). The grenouille has jumped 39 + 19 = 58 inches more than the sauterelle. So, the grenouille has jumped 58 - 94 = 26 inches less than the sauterille. Therefore, the grenouille has jumped 26 inches.
Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 25 inches (pouces). The grenouille has jumped 32 inches more than the sauterelle, so it has jumped 32 + 25 = 57 inches. Finally, we are told that the souris has jumped 26 inches less than the grenouille, so it has jumped 57 - 26 = 31 inches. Therefore, the souris has jumped 31 inches.
Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 24 inches (pouces). The frog has jumped 33 inches more than the sauterelle, so it has jumped 33 + 24 = 57 inches. Finally, we are told that the mouse has jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so it has jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches. Therefore, the mouse has jumped 52 inches more than the sauterelle. 
Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 13 inches and the difference between their jumps is 2 inches. So, if we subtract 2 from 13, we get 11. Therefore, the grenouille has jumped 11 inches.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 31 inches (since we are told that the sausage jumped 35 inches and the frog jumped 31 inches). So, if the sausage jumped 35 inches, then it is true to say that the frog jumped 31 - 35 = -4 inches less than the sausage. Therefore, the total distance jumped by both of them together is equal to the sum of their individual jumps minus the difference between their jumps. In other words, the total distance jumped by both of them together is equal to 35 + (-4) = 39 inches.
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 19 inches (pouces). The grenouille has jumped x inches less than the sauterelle. So, we can write an equation:
x + 19 = 44
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 44 - 19 = 25
So, the grenouille has jumped 25 inches."
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 39 inches (or 39 ""). The grenouille has jumped 19 inches more than the sauterelle, so it has jumped 39 + 19 = 58 inches. Finally, we are told that the souris has jumped 12 inches less than the grenouille, so it has jumped 58 - 12 = 46 inches. Therefore, the souris has jumped 46 inches. "
Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 21 inches (pouces) and the grenouille has jumped 25 inches more than the sauterelle. So, the grenouille has jumped 25 + 21 = 46 inches. The souris has jumped 16 fewer inches than the grenouille, so it has jumped 46 - 16 = 30 inches. Therefore, the sauterelle has jumped 21 + 30 = 51 inches more than the souris.  
Response:  The difference between the height of the jump made by the frog and that made by the grasshopper is equal to the distance traveled by the frog minus the distance traveled by the grasshopper. So we can write this equation: 39 - 17 = x, where x represents the distance traveled by the frog. Therefore, the frog has traveled 22 inches more than the grasshopper (39 - 17 = 22).
"Response:  We know that the sausage jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 33 inches more than the sausage. So the frog jumped 42 inches (33 + 9). Now we need to find out how much less the mouse jumped than the frog. The question states that the mouse jumped ""de 3 pouces de moins"" than the frog. In French, ""de 3 pouces"" means ""3 inches"". So the mouse jumped 42 - 3 = 39 inches. "
Response:  We know that the sausage jumped 14 inches and the frog jumped 37 inches more than the sausage. So the frog jumped 37 + 14 = 51 inches. The mouse jumped x inches less than the frog. Therefore, the mouse jumped 51 - x inches. Since we are given that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the sausage, we can write an equation as follows: 51 - x = 16. Solving for x gives us x = 35. So the mouse jumped 35 inches less than the sausage. 
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 tasses of flour and 6 tasses of sugar. If Mary has already added 5 tasses of flour, then she needs to add 9 more tasses (14 - 5 = 9). To find out how many tasses of sugar she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of sugar required by the number of tasses she has already added: 6 / 5 = 1.2 tasses. So, Mary needs to add 1.2 tasses of sugar.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 tasses of flour and 11 tasses of sugar. If she has already added 4 tasses of flour, then we need to subtract 4 from 9 to get the remaining amount of flour needed = 5 tasses. Now, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (11) by the remaining amount of flour needed (5) to find out how many tasses of sugar she needs to add = 2.2 tasses. So, she needs to add 2.2 tasses of sugar more than the amount of flour she has already added.
"Response:  If Mary has already added some farine to make the cake and the recipe requires 6 tasses of farine in total, then she needs 6 - x tasses of farine where x is the amount she has already added. Since the recipe also requires 13 tasses of sucre, we can set up an equation as follows:
Farine needed = 6 - x
Sucre needed = 13
Now, we are told that Mary needs 8 more tasses of farine than sucre. So, if she needs 8 more tasses of farine, this means that she needs 8 - (13 - x) tasses of farine. Substituting the expression for x from the previous equation, we get:
Farine needed = 8 - (13 - 6 + x)
Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Mary must add 2 tasses of farine to the mixture. Therefore, the answer is 2 tasses."
"Response:  If Mary has already put some tasses of farine and she needs 2 more tasses than the amount of sugar required, then we can write an equation as follows:
Farine = Sugar + 2
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:
Sugar = 7 tasses
So, Farine = 7 + 2 = 9 tasses
Therefore, Mary has put 9 tasses of farine."
Response:  The recipe asks for 11 tasses of sugar and some tasses of flour in addition to what Mary has already added (3 tasses). So if she needs to add 6 more tasses of flour, that means the total amount of flour needed is 6 + 3 = 9 tasses. Therefore, the original recipe called for 9 tasses of flour.
"Response:  If Mary has already put some tasses of farine and she needs to add 2 more tasses, then we can write an equation as follows:
Farine already used = Total amount of farine - Farine needed
In this case, the total amount of farine is 12 tasses (as requested in the recipe), so we can write:
Farine already used = 12 - 2
Farine already used = 10 tasses
Therefore, Mary has already put 10 tasses of farine into the mixture."
Response:  We know that we need to add 9 - 3 = 6 more tasses of flour. So, Mary needs to add 6 more tasses of flour to make the cake.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 tasses of sugar and we have already added 2 tasses. So, to find out how many more tasses of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total required: 14 - 2 = 12. Therefore, Mary must add 12 more tasses of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tasses of farine to make the cake. The recipe requires 12 tasses in total. So we need to find out how many more tasses she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount needed (12) by the amount she has already added (11): 12 / 11 = 1.09. Therefore, Mary must add 1 more tasse of farine to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that we need to add 3 tasses of flour (since the recipe asks for 10 tasses and Mary has already added 7). So, if we want to make the full amount of galette, we must add 3 more tasses of flour. Now, let's check how much sugar is needed. The recipe asks for 2 tasses of sugar, but since Mary has already added 2 tasses, she doesn't need to add any more sugar. Therefore, we only need to add 3 more tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tasses of farine to make the cake. So, we have to add the amount of farine needed to make up for the remaining 10 tasses (12 - 2 = 10). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 10 tasses of farine.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tasses of farine to make the cake. The recipe requires 6 tasses of farine in total. So, we need to find out how many tasses of farine are left to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of farine she has already added (5 tasses) from the total amount required (6 tasses). This means there are 1 tasse of farine left to add. 
Now, let's move on to the sucre and sel. The recipe requires 8 tasses of sucre and 7 tasses of sel. Since Mary has already added 5 tasses of farine, she has also used up 5/2 = 2 1/2 tasses of sucre and 5/3 = 1 1/3 tasses of sel. Therefore, she needs to add an additional 5 - 2 1/2 = 2 3/4 tasses of sucre and 5 - 1 1/3 = 3 2/3 tasses of sel."
Response:  The recipe asks for 13 tasses of sugar and Mary has already added 2 tasses of sugar. So, she needs to add 11 more tasses of sugar (13 - 2 = 11).
Response:  We know that we need to add 9 tasses of flour and we have already added 4 tasses of sugar. So, we must add 9 - 4 = 5 more tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that we need to add 9 - 2 = 7 more tasses of flour. So, Mary needs to add 7 more tasses of flour to make the cake.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tasses of farine to make the cake. So, we need to find out how many more tasses of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can use the ratio of sugar to flour in the recipe. According to the recipe, for every 5 tasses of flour, there is 1 tasse of sugar. Therefore, if Mary has already used 11 tasses of flour (which is equal to 22 tasses since each tasse of flour represents 2 tasses of sugar), then she needs to add 5 tasses of sugar more. So, the final answer is 5 tasses of sugar.
"Response:  If Mary has already put some tasses of farine and she needs 5 more tasses than the amount of sugar required, then we can write an equation as follows:
Farine = Sugar + 5
Now, we know that the recipe requires 3 tasses of sucre, so we can substitute this value in the equation:
Farine = 3 + 5
Farine = 8
Therefore, Mary has put 8 tasses of farine into the cake."
Response:  If Mary needs to make 12 more tasses of flour and the recipe requires 13 tasses of flour in total, then she has already used x tasses of flour where x is the number of tasses she has already made. So we can write an equation as follows: 12 + x = 13. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: x = 13 - 12 = 1. Therefore, Mary has already used 1 tasse of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 tasses of flour and we have already added 7 tasses. So, to find out how many more tasses she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total required: 14 - 7 = 7. Therefore, Mary should add 7 more tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 tasses of sugar and 9 tasses of flour. If she has already added 12 tasses of flour (which is more than what the recipe asks for) and 10 tasses of sugar (which is less than what the recipe asks for), then we need to subtract 12 - 10 = 2 tasses of flour from the total amount of flour used so far. Similarly, since she has already added 10 tasses of sugar, we don't need to add any more sugar. So, the final answer is 2 tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that there are 10 tasses of farine needed for the recipe and Mary has already added 6 tasses. So we need to find out how many more tasses she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of farine needed (10) by the amount of farine Mary has already added (6): 10 / 6 = 1 and 6/7. Therefore, Mary must add 7 more tasses of farine.
Response:  We know that we need to add 5 more tasses of flour than sugar (since there are 9 tasses of sugar and 5 more tasses needed). So, we can write an equation as follows: 9 - 5 = x, where x is the number of additional tasses of flour needed. Now, we have to solve for x using subtraction. Therefore, x = 4. Hence, Mary needs to add 4 more tasses of flour to make the cake.
Response:  We know that we need to add 7 tasses of flour and we have already added 2 tasses of flour so we need to add 5 more tasses (7 - 2 = 5). Now, we also know that we need to add 4 tasses of salt, so we will add 4 tasses of salt. Therefore, we will add 5 + 4 = 9 tasses of flour and salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 tasses of farine to make the cake. The recipe requires 6 tasses of farine in total. So, we need to subtract the amount she has already used (12) from the total amount required (6), which gives us 6 tasses of farine left to add. Now, let's check how much sucre and salt are needed. The recipe asks for 11 tasses of sucre and 9 tasses of sel. Since Mary has already added 12 tasses of farine, she needs to add 3 tasses of sucre (since 11 - 12 = -1) and 0 tasses of sel (since 9 is not affected). Therefore, Mary should add 3 more tasses of sucre and keep the same amount of sel.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 7 tasses of sugar and we have already added 4 tasses. So, to find out how many more tasses of sugar we need to add, we can subtract the amount we have already added from the total required: 7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more tasses of sugar.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tasses of sugar to the recipe and we want to find out how many more tasses of flour she needs to add. So, let's substitute the value of 10 in the original equation with x (since we don't know the exact value yet). Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

12 - 10 = x + 14

Now, we need to convert this equation into an equivalent fraction format. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 12:

x/12 = 14/12

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:

x = 1

So, Mary needs to add one more tasse of flour to the recipe."
Response:  If there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain and 60 families have left for winter, then the number of families that stayed behind is 19 - 60 = -41. So, 41 more families of birds went to warmer places for winter than those who remained in the area.
Response:  If there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 7 have already left for winter, then the number of families that stayed behind is equal to 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, 80 families of birds remained in the area while 7 went away for winter.
"Response:  We know that 20 families of birds have migrated to warmer places for winter and 14 families have stayed near the mountain. So, if we assume that there were initially X families of birds living near the mountain, then we can write an equation as follows:
X - 20 = 14
Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many families of birds lived near the mountain at first.
Solution: To solve the above equation, we need to add 20 to both sides of the equation:
X + 20 = 34 (since 14 + 20 = 34)
Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get the original value of X:
X = 17
So, originally, there were 17 families of birds living near the mountain."
"Response:  We know that 85 families of birds live near the mountain. If 23 families have gone to Africa and 37 families have gone to Asia, then we are left with:

85 - 23 = 62 families of birds who stayed near the mountain."
Response:  We know that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer places during winter. If 42 families of birds have gone to Africa and 31 families have gone to Asia, then we can say that the number of families of birds that went to Africa is equal to the number of families that went to Asia minus 31. So, the number of families of birds that went to Africa = 42 - 31 = 11. Therefore, 11 more families of birds went to Africa than those who went to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer places during winter. If 47 families of birds have gone to Africa and 94 families have gone to Asia, then we can say that the number of families of birds that went to Asia is equal to the number of families that went to Africa minus 47. So, the difference between the two numbers is equal to 94 - 47 = 47. Therefore, 47 more families of birds went to Asia than went to Africa.
"Response:  We know that 18 families of birds live near the mountain and they all go to warmer places for winter. So, if 38 families went to Africa and 80 families went to Asia, then the total number of families that left is:
38 + 80 = 118
So, there are 118 families of birds that have gone away for winter."
Response:  The original number of families of birds living near the mountain is 87. If 18 new families join them, then the total number of families will be 87 + 18 = 105. So, there are now 105 families of birds living near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 59 families of birds have left for winter and 24 new families have come to live near the mountain from the Arctic region. So, the total number of bird families near the mountain is:
Total = Number of families remaining + Number of new families
= 49 + 24
= 73
Therefore, there are 73 families of birds living near the mountain."
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds have migrated to warmer places for winter and there were initially 41 families living near the mountain. So, the number of families remaining nearby is:  41 - 27 = 14.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain. If 86 families of birds have gone for wintering, then the number of families remaining behind is:
Number of families remaining = Initial number of families - Number of families gone for wintering
= 45 - 86
= -41
So, there are 41 families of birds who remained behind in the area after the migration to wintering places."
Response:  We know that 35 families of birds have gone to Asia and 62 families have gone to Africa. So, the difference between the number of families that went to Africa and those who went to Asia is 62 - 35 = 27. Therefore, there are 27 more families of birds in Africa than in Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 3 families of birds living near the mountain and they will stay there during winter. Then we have 26 new families of birds who moved to the area from the Arctic. So, in total, there are 3 + 26 = 29 families of birds living near the mountain. However, two families of birds left the area to go south for winter, so there are actually 29 - 2 = 27 families of birds remaining near the mountain. Therefore, the correct answer is 27.
Response:  We know that Paul received 253 crayons and lost or gave away 70 during the year. So, at the end of the year, he had 183 crayons left (253 - 70 = 183).
"Response:  We know that at the end of the year, Paul had 177 crayons left. If he received some more for his birthday, then we can say that the total number of crayons he has now is equal to the initial amount plus the new ones given to him. So, the answer is:

Total number of crayons = Initial amount + New crayons
= 551 + x
where x is the number of crayons he received as gift.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 374
So, Paul received 374 crayons as a gift for his birthday."
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 crayons and gave away 111 of them to his friends during the school year. So, he has 329 crayons left (440 - 111 = 329). Then we are told that he lost 106 crayons. Therefore, he has 223 crayons left (329 - 106 = 223).
Response:  We know that Paul received 65 crayons as a gift and gave away 213 during the school year. So, he lost 16 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons given away or lost is 213 + 16 = 229 crayons.
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 crayons for his birthday and gave away 571 during the school year. This means he has 18 crayons left (589 - 571 = 18). Now we are told that he lost 161 crayons. So, the number of crayons he has now is 18 + 161 = 179. Therefore, the answer to the question is 179.
Response:  We know that Paul has received 110 crayons and given away 90 crayons during the school year. This means he now has 210 crayons left (110 - 90 = 210). However, we are also told that he has lost 412 crayons. So, to find out how many more crayons he has lost than he gave away, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away from the total number of crayons he had at the start of the school year: 210 - 90 = 120. Therefore, Paul has lost 120 crayons more than he gave away.
"Response:  If Paul received x crayons for his birthday and gave away 563 during the school year, then he must have lost 558 crayons. So, the number of crayons he has left is:
x - 558 = 332
Therefore, Paul received 332 crayons for his birthday."
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 crayons during the school year and lost/gave away 535 crayons in total. So, if he has 492 crayons left, we can write an equation as follows: 52 + 535 = 492. Now, let's solve for the number of crayons given or lost: 587 = 535 - 52. Therefore, Paul has given or lost 52 crayons.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 521 crayons and 66 gummies. If he didn't lose or give any during the year, then at the end of the year, he would have 521 + 66 = 587 total items. However, we are told that he only had 154 left without losing or giving away any. So, the difference between the initial amount and the final amount is equal to the number of crayons and gummies lost or given away: 587 - 154 = 433. Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 433 crayons and gummies during the year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 531 crayons and 38 gummies. If he didn't lose any gum during the year, then he must have received 38 gummies more than he already had at the start of the year. So, if x is the number of gummies he got during the year, we can write an equation as follows: 38 = x - 38 (initial amount). Now, let's focus on the crayons. At the end of the year, Paul had 391 crayons left. This means that he lost some crayons during the year. However, since he gained 38 gummies, he must have used fewer crayons to make room for them. Therefore, the difference between the number of crayons he had at the start of the year and the number he had at the end of the year is equal to the number of gummies he got during the year minus the initial number of gummies he had. Using this reasoning, we can set up another equation: 531 - 391 = x - 38. Now we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how many crayons and gummies Paul had at the end of the year. Solving both equations, we get: x = 79 (number of gummies) and 432 (number of crayons). So, Paul had 432 crayons and 79 gummies at the end of the year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 601 crayons and 406 gummies. If he didn't lose any gummies during the year, then he must have received 295 more gummies than crayons (601 - 406 = 295). So, the number of gummies he has now is 406 + 295 = 697 gummies. Therefore, he has 697 - 336 = 361 more gummies than crayons.
Response:  We know that Paul received x crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 291 crayons left, which means he lost or gave away 315 - 291 = 24 crayons. So, Paul received x = 24 crayons for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 crayons for his birthday and lost 231 during the school year. So he has 36 (267 - 231) crayons left. Now we are asked how many more crayons he gave to his friends than he lost. This means we need to find the difference between the number of crayons he gave away (308) and the number he lost (231). Therefore, the answer is 77 (308 - 231).
Response:  At first, Paul had 457 gummies and 320 crayons. After one year, he still has 523 objects without losing any gummi or crayon. So, if we subtract the number of gummies (457) from the total number of objects (523), we get: Number of crayons = 523 - 457 = 66. Therefore, Paul has 66 more crayons than gummies at the end of the year.
Response:  The server had 11 clients initially and then some left, leaving 3 behind. So, the number of clients who left is equal to the number of clients remaining (3). Therefore, the number of clients who left = 3.
Response:  The server had 3 clients initially and then some left, leaving it with 4 clients. So, the number of clients who remained after some left is 4 - 3 = 1 more client than those who left. Therefore, there were 1 + 3 = 4 more clients who stayed than those who left.
Response:  The server had 9 clients at first and lost 9 of them. So it has 9 - 9 = 0 clients left. Then, 12 new clients arrived. Therefore, the final number of clients is 0 + 12 = 12.
Response:  The server had initially 14 clients. If 5 of them left, then the number of remaining clients is equal to 14 minus 5 = 9. So, there are 9 clients left with the server.
Response:  The server had 13 clients initially and then some left. After that, 4 new clients joined. So, the total number of clients now is 13 + 4 = 17. And if there are still 9 clients, it means that 8 clients have left (17 - 9 = 8). Therefore, 8 clients have parted.
Response:  The server had 12 clients initially and then lost 15 of them. So it has 12 - 15 = -3 clients left. Then, it gained 14 new clients. Therefore, the number of clients the server has now is -3 + 14 = 11 clients.
Response:  The server had 3 clients initially and then some more arrived to make it 8 in total. So, the number of new clients who arrived is 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  The server had 8 clients initially and then some left, leaving it with 5 clients remaining. Then, 99 new clients joined, bringing the total number of clients to what? So, the answer is 94 (5 + 99).
Response:  The server had 12 clients initially and then some left, leaving it with 14 clients. Then, 10 new clients joined, bringing the total number of clients to... (think)...14 + 10 = 24! So, the server now has 24 clients.
Response:  At first, Dan had $3 + $2 = $5. So he initially had $5.
Response:  If Dan had $4 and spent money on something that left him with $3 remaining, then the cost of what he bought must have been $4 - $3 = $1. So, the bar of chocolate cost $1.
Response:  The total cost of all the bars is $99 x 3 = $297. So, if he paid $4 for them, then the change he should get back is $297 - $4 = $293.
"Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is given as $3. Since he bought two bars of chocolate, we can write:
$$ 3 = 2 \times x $$
where $x$ is the cost of each bar of chocolate. Substituting this equation into the original equation, we get:
$$ 6 = 2 \times x $$
Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:
$$ 3 = x $$
So, the cost of each bar of chocolate is $3."
Response:  If Dan paid $2 for each bar of chocolate he bought, and each bar costs $3, then... (1) The total amount Dan spent on buying chocolate bars is $2 x number of bars = $2N (2) Since each bar costs $3, the total value of the chocolate bars Dan bought is $3N (3) Now we can equate these two expressions to solve for N: $2N = $3N (4) Simplifying equation (4), we get 2N = 3N (5) Divide both sides by 2 to find the solution: N = 1.5 (So Dan bought 1.5 bars of chocolate.)
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $7 in total. Then he spent $2 for the bar of chocolate and $3 for another chocolate, so his remaining amount is: $7 - $2 - $3 = $2. Therefore, Dan has $2 left after buying both chocolates.
"Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is equal to the cost of the barre de chocolat + the cost of the chocolat. So we can write this equation: $ = $ + $ 
We know that the cost of the barre de chocolat is 7 dollars and the cost of the chocolat is 6 dollars. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation as follows: $ = 7 + 6 $= 13 
So, Dan spent 13 dollars in total to buy the barre de chocolat and the chocolat."
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is $2 + $6 + $3 = $11. So, to find out how much he spent on the bar of chocolate compared to the chocolate, we can divide the amount he spent on the bar of chocolate ($6) by the amount he spent on the chocolate ($3). This gives us a ratio of 6/3 = 2. Therefore, Dan spent twice as much on the bar of chocolate as he did on the chocolate.
"Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is $5 + $2 + $3 = $10. So he spent $10 to buy both chocolate and a bar of chocolate. Therefore, the proportion of money spent on each item is:
$10 / ($2 + $3) = $10 / $5 = 2
So Dan spent twice as much money on chocolate than he did on the bar of chocolate."
Response:  Firstly, Dan had $4. Then he bought a bar of chocolate for $8. So now he has $4 - $8 = -$4. His friend then gave him $5, so his new amount is $5 + (-$4) = $1. Therefore, Dan has $1 left after all these transactions.
Response:  If Dan had $4 at first and spent all of it on the bar of chocolate, then he must have paid $4 for the bar of chocolate. So, the cost of the bar of chocolate is $4.
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for something and now he has $3 left. So, if we divide $4 by 2 (since he had twice as much money before), we get $2. That means he spent $2 on whatever he bought. Now, since each bar of candy cost him the same amount of money ($2), he bought 5 bars of candy (since $2 / $2 = 5). Therefore, there are 5 x 10 = 50 bars of candy in total. Finally, since he spent $2 on them, he has $3 - $2 = $1 left over.
Response:  We know that Dan paid a total of $4 for the candy bars. Since he bought 2 bars, we can write the equation: 4 = x + x where x is the cost of each bar. Now, we are asked to find out how much each bar costs. So, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 4/2 = $2 per bar. Therefore, each bar of candy costs $2.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is $5 + $3 = $8. He spent $7 on the bar of candy and $3 on the chocolate. So, he spent $7 / $3 = $2.33 more on the bar of candy than he did on the chocolate.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is $7 + $2 = $9. So, he spent $9 to buy chocolate and $9 / 2 = $4.50 to buy a bar of candy. Therefore, Dan spent $4.50 to buy chocolate compared to the $4 he spent to buy a bar of candy.
Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them during a garage sale. So, now he has... (115 - 78) = 37 books left.
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books at a garage sale, he had 105 left. So, if he started with some number of books (let's call it x), then we can set up the equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 268
So, Paul had 268 books at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after selling some of them at a garage sale, he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

108 - x = 62

Where ""x"" represents the number of books sold at the garage sale.

Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 108:

x / 108 = 62 / 108

x = 62 / 108

So, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale (since 62 / 108 = 46)."
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and after buying some during a garage sale he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation:

Initial number of books = 50
Number of books bought = x
Final number of books = Initial number of books + Number of books bought
= 50 + x

We are also given that there are now 151 books in total. So, we can set up another equation:

Total number of books = Initial number of books + Number of books bought
= 50 + x

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and 151). Solving for x, we get:

x = 101

So, Paul bought 101 books during the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 2 books (so he has 2 x 58 = 116 books in total). Then, during the garage sale, he sold some of his books and ended up with 58 books left. So, we can calculate how many books he sold as follows: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left after the sale = 116 - 58 = 58 books. Therefore, Paul sold 58 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 21 books and then sold some during a garage sale to get $300. After that, he bought 42 new books, which means he now has 73 books (21 + 42). Finally, he sold some more books to get $150, leaving him with 68 books (73 - 5 = 68). So, he sold 9 books more than he bought ($300 - $150 = $150 / $5 = 9).
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 71 books and then he sold some of them during a garage sale. So, let's say he sold x books. Now, he has 116 - 71 = 45 books left. Then, he bought 38 new books, so now he has 45 + 38 = 83 books in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold is 83 - x = 45. Since we are asked how many books he bought more than he sold, we can conclude that x = 20 (books).
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them during the garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. To find out how many books he sold during the garage sale, we can use the following equation: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Remaining number of books After the garage sale = 108 - 66 = 42 books So, Paul sold 42 books during the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 51 books and 106 pens. If he sold some of them during the garage sale, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Number of books = 82 (books left after the sale) - 51 (initial number of books) = 31 Number of pens = 14 (pens left after the sale) - 106 (initial number of pens) = -92 Since there is no negative quantity of pens, it means that Paul sold all his pens during the garage sale. Therefore, the answer to the question is 106.
"Response:  If Paul initially had 136 books and sold some of them during the garage sale, then he has fewer books now than he did at first. So let x be the number of books Paul sold. Since he made $27 from selling those books, we can write the equation:
x × price = total_amount
where price is the amount Paul made per book (in this case, $27). Solving for x, we get:
x = total_amount / price
= 27 / 27
= 1
So Paul sold 1 book during the garage sale."
Response:  We know that after giving 39 books to his friend, Paul had 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then he sold some of them during the garage sale and ended up with 95 - x = 68 books, where x is the number of books he sold. So we can set up the equation: 95 - x = 68. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, Paul sold 27 books during the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 stylos and 153 books. If he sold some of them during the garage sale, we can write an equation using these numbers:

Number of stylos = 95 - x
Number of books = 153 - y

where x and y are the number of stylos and books sold respectively.
We also know that after selling some books and stylos, he had 13 books and 23 stylos left. So, we can substitute these values in the equations above:

Number of stylos = 95 - x
Number of books = 153 - y

Now, we need to solve for x and y. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the first equation for x, we get:

x = 95 - Number of stylos left

Substituting this value in the second equation, we get:

153 - y = Number of books left

Solving for y, we get:
y = 120

So, Paul sold 33 books (153 - 120) during the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 stylos and 143 books. If he sold some of his books during the garage sale, he would have fewer books left. So let's say he sold x books. Since each book is worth y dollars, we can write an equation: 143x = 113y (books sold) x (initial value per book) Now, we also know that Paul sold some stylos during the garage sale. Let's assume he sold z stylos. Then, we can write another equation: 42z = 19 (stylos sold) x ( initial value per stylus) Substituting the values from the first equation into the second equation, we get: 42z = 19(143) Solving for z, we get: z = 7 Therefore, Paul sold 7 stylos during the garage sale.
Response:  There were initially 10 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica added 8 more roses from her garden of flowers to the vase, making the total number of roses now 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase. Therefore, there are 18 roses in the vase now.
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the vase (according to the question). Then, Jessica added 16 more roses from her garden of flowers, so now there are 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 16 roses in the vase.
Response:  There were initially 2 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase and cut some new roses from her garden of flowers to put into the vase. So, there are now 2 + 4 = 6 roses in the vase. Finally, she cut some more roses from her garden to add to the vase, making it 6 + x = 23 roses total in the vase. Therefore, x = 17.
Response:  If there were initially 15 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 33 roses, then there are now 0 roses left in the vase (since she threw them all away). So, if she added some new roses from her garden to replace those she threw away, then there must be an additional number of roses equal to the original number of roses that she threw away. Therefore, the answer is 33 roses more than the initial number of roses in the vase. 
Response:  If there were originally 21 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 34 roses, then there are now 21 - 34 = -13 roses left in the vase. However, she also cut some new roses from her garden to put into the vase, which is equal to the number of roses she threw away (-13). Therefore, the total number of roses she added to the vase is 0, since the number of roses she threw away equals the number she added. So, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that there were originally 7 roses in the vase and then Jessica added some more from her garden which had a total of 59 roses. So, she must have cut 52 roses (59 - 7) from her garden to add them to the vase. Therefore, she has cut 52 roses.
Response:  If there were originally 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some additional roses from her garden that had a total of 12 roses, then the number of roses she brought to the vase is 12 - 13 = -1 rose. So, there are -1 rose left in her garden. 
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden of flowers. So, now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before she cut them (15) from the number of roses after she cut them (17). Therefore, Jessica cut 2 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchidées in the vase. If Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden of flowers, then there are now 10 roses and 21 orchidées in the vase. To find out how many orchidées Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of orchidées before she cut them (2) from the number of orchidées after she cut them (21). Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchidées.
Response:  There were initially 5 roses and 3 orchidées in the vase. If Jessica added some more rose and orchidée from her garden of flowers, then there are now 12 roses and 2 orchidées in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchidées are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of orchidées from the number of roses: 12 - 2 = 10. So, there are 10 more roses than orchidées in the vase now.
Response:  There were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. If Jessica cut some more rose and orchid from her garden of flowers, there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids: 20 - 11 = 9. So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses in the vase and Jessica has now added 16 more roses (19 - 3 = 16), then she must have cut 3 roses from the original bouquet. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica cut was 3.
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden of flowers. Now, there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before she cut them (13) from the number of roses after she cut them (14). So, Jessica cut 1 rose.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchidées in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden of flowers. So, now there are 7 orchidées and 13 roses in the vase. To find out how many orchidées Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of orchidées after she cut them (7) from the initial number of orchidées (3). Therefore, Jessica cut 3 orchidées. 
Response:  There were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden of flowers, then there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses: 22 - 20 = 2. So, there are 2 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  There were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden of flowers. So, there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the total number of orchids. Therefore, the answer is 10 (i.e., 13 - 3 = 10).
"Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some inches, then her new length is 13 inches less than that original length. So, if we let x be the original length of Robin's hair in inches, we can write the equation:
x - 3 = 13
Now solve for x:
x = 16
So, Robin cut off 3 inches from her hair."
Response:  If Robin had 20 inches of hair before cutting it off and now has 10 inches, then she had 30 inches of hair originally (20 - 10 = 30).
"Response: 
Firstly, Robin had 16 inches of hair (or 16 x 0.4 = 6.4 feet).
Then, she cut 11 inches off (or 11 x 0.4 = 4.4 feet). So now her hair was 6.4 - 4.4 = 2 feet long.
After that, her hair grew back to 12 inches (or 12 x 0.4 = 4.8 feet). Therefore, her current length of hair is 2 + 4.8 = 6.8 feet or approximately 7 feet."
"Response:  If Robin's hair was previously 19 inches long (or 48 cm), and it grew an additional 18 inches (or 46 cm), then her new length of hair would be:

New length = Old length + Growth
= 48 cm + 18 cm
= 66 cm

So, Robin's hair is now 66 cm (or 25.6 inches) long."
Response:  If Robin had initially 14 inches of hair and now has 13 inches less, then her current length is... (14 - 13) = 1 inch. So, Robin's hair is currently 1 inch long.
Response:  At first, Robin had hair that was 14 inches long (or 14 pouces). Then, her hair grew another 8 inches (or 8 pouces), making it 22 inches (or 22 pouces) long in total. Finally, she cut off 20 inches of her hair, leaving her with 2 inches (or 2 pouces) left. So, to answer your question, Robin now has hair that is 2 inches long.
Response:  Danny had 12 capsules of bottles in his collection initially. Then he found 53 more capsules at the park. So, now he has 12 + 53 = 65 capsules of bottles.
Response:  If Danny had found 21 capsules of bottles in his collection and then he found some more at the park, that means he has found a total of 21 + x capsules where 'x' is the number of additional capsules he found at the park. So, the answer is 21 + x = 53. Therefore, x = 32.
Response:  We know that Danny had 51 old bottle caps at first and he found 63 new ones in the park. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny has now is 51 + 63 = 114. Since Danny threw away 51 caps, he has 114 - 51 = 63 caps left in his collection. Therefore, Danny had 63 bottle caps at the start.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 36 capsules from the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he now has 22 capsules in his collection. To find out how many more capsules Danny found at the park than he threw away, we can subtract the number of capsules he threw away (35) from the total number of capsules he collected (36): 36 - 35 = 1. Therefore, Danny found 1 more capsu...
Response:  We know that Danny has found 30 capsules at the park and he already had 42 in his collection before going to the park. So, the total number of capsules he had was 42 + 30 = 72. Now we are told that he threw away more than those he found at the park. This means that the number of capsules he threw away is greater than 30. Therefore, the difference between the number of capsules he threw away and the number he found at the park is equal to the total number of capsules he had (72) minus the number of capsules he found at the park (30). In other words, the difference is 72 - 30 = 42. So, Danny threw away 42 capsules more than he found at the park. 
Response:  We know that Danny collected 22 capsules of bottles and 8 packaging at the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 items in his collection initially. Then, he found more capsules and packages, which increased his total number to 28 capsules and 63 packages. Therefore, Danny had 30 - 22 = 8 capsules of bottles at the beginning.
"Response:  At first, Danny had 22 capsules of bottles and 30 packages at the park. Then he collected more capsules and packages from the park, so his total number of capsules increased to 17 and his total number of packages decreased to 57. To find out how many packages Danny had at first, we can set up an equation using these values:

Number of packages at first = Total number of packages - Number of packages collected from the park
= 57 - (22 + 30)
= 57 - 52
= 5
So, Danny had 5 packages at the park initially."
"Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 30 capsules of bottles and 14 packages in his collection. Then he found more at the park, which is equal to 7 capsules of bottles and 86 packages. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Let x be the number of additional capsules of bottles found by Danny at the park. 
Then, the total number of capsules of bottles Danny has now = initial number + additional number = 30 + x 
Similarly, the total number of packages Danny has now = initial number + additional number = 14 + 86 = 100
So, x = 7 (capsules of bottles)
Therefore, Danny has 7 more capsules of bottles than packages he found at the park."
Response:  We know that Danny had 0 capsules and 0 emballages initially. Then he found 11 capsules and 28 emballages at the park. So now he has 11 + 28 = 39 capsules and 28 emballages. Next, we are told that he collected more capsules and emballages from the park, which means he got 68 additional capsules and 51 additional emballages. Therefore, his final collection consists of 39 + 68 = 107 capsules and 51 + 28 = 80 emballages. Finally, to find out how many more emballages than capsules Danny found at the park, we subtract the number of emballages he already had (28) from the total number of emballages he found (51): 51 - 28 = 23. So Danny found 23 more emballages than capsules at the park.
"Response: 
Danny had initially found 71 capsules of bottles and 24 packaging at the park. So he had 71 + 24 = 95 items in his collection.
Now, he has 28 more capsules than packages, so he has 28 + 16 = 44 additional capsules.
Therefore, Danny now has 95 + 44 = 139 items in his collection, including both capsules and packaging."
"Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 capsules of bottles and 62 packaging at the park. So he collected 27 more capsules of bottles and 43 more packages. Therefore, the number of packages Danny has now is 43 - 62 = -21 more than the number of capsules of bottles he has. 
So, Danny has 27 + (-21) = 48 more emballements than capsules of bottles."
Response:  We know that Danny had 100 capsules of bottle at first (he collected them). Then he lost 66 capsules in the park. So, he has 34 capsules left (100 - 66 = 34). Now, he has 25 capsules in his collection, which means he lost additional 9 capsules after collecting them from the park (34 - 25 = 9). Therefore, Danny had 9 capsules more than what he currently has in his collection at the beginning. Hence, the answer is 9.
Response:  If Danny had 25 capsules of bottles in his collection before he went to the park and found some more, then he must have found 8 more capsules at the park (32 - 25 = 8). So, he has 8 additional capsules from the park.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 60 old capsules and found 58 new ones. So he has 67 capsules now. To find out how many capsules Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of capsules he threw away from the total number of capsules he has now: 67 - 60 = 7. Therefore, Danny had 7 capsules at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 6 old capsules and found 50 new ones, so he has 50 + 6 = 56 capsules in his collection now. Therefore, the number of additional capsules he found at the park is 56 - 6 = 50. 
Response:  We know that Danny has thrown away 54 old capsules and found 48 new ones. So, he now has 52 capsules in his collection. To find out how many more capsules Danny threw away than he found, we can subtract the number of capsules he found from the number of capsules he threw away: 54 - 48 = 6. Therefore, Danny threw away 6 more capsules than he found at the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had collected 82 emballages and 29 capsules of bottles at the park. Then he found more emballages and capsules in his house, so he now has 42 capsules of bottles and 61 emballages in his collection. To find out how many capsules of bottles Danny had at the start, we can subtract the number of capsules he already had from the total number of capsules he found: 82 - 29 = 53. So Danny had 53 capsules of bottles at the start.
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 emballages and 39 capsules of bottles at the park. Then he collected more emballages and capsules. After collecting, he has 16 capsules of bottles and 68 emballages in his collection. So initially, Danny had 66 emballages.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 46 emballages and 50 capsules of bottles at the park. So he found 46 + 50 = 96 more emballages and capsules of bottles in total. Now we have 21 capsules of bottles and 52 emballages in his collection, so we can deduce that he has 21 - 46 = -25 fewer capsules of bottles than emballages. Therefore, Danny has 52 - (-25) = 77 more emballages than capsules of bottles at the park. 
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 31 capsules of bottles and 9 packages at home. He found 65 packaging and 5 bottle caps in the park. So he had more packaging than bottle caps in the park. Therefore, the number of additional packages Danny found in the park is equal to the difference between the total number of packages he found and the number of packages he already had at home. That is, 65 - (31 + 9) = 47. 
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 58 capsules of bottles and 25 packages at the park. So, he collected 11 more packages and 12 more capsules of bottles. Therefore, the number of capsules of bottles that Danny has now is 12 + 58 = 70. And the number of packages that Danny has now is 11 + 25 = 36.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 18 emballages and 15 capsules of bottles at the park. So he collected 67 more emballages and 35 more capsules of bottles. Therefore, the number of emballages Danny has now is 67 + 18 = 85, and the number of capsules of bottles he has now is 35 + 15 = 50. 
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven. So if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x + 11 peaches. Therefore, Steven has 21 peaches (x + 11).
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. So if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 7 peaches. Also, we know that Steven has 15 peaches. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x - 7) = 15. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 15. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 7. So, Jake has 7 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, which means he has 18 + x peaches, where x is the number of peaches Steven has. Since Steven has 19 peaches, we can write the equation: Jake = 18 + x, where x is equal to 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, Jill has 27 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 3 + 8 = 11 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 11 - 5 = 6 more peaches than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has x peaches. Since Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, we can write an equation: Steven = Jill + 11. Now, since Jill has 4 more peaches than Jake, we can write another equation: Jill = Jake + 4. Finally, we can substitute these equations into each other to solve for Jill's number of peaches: Jill = Jake + 4 = (Steven - 12) + 11 =.... Solving this equation gives us Jill has 15 peaches. So, Jill has 15 peaches more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer peaches than Steven and more peaches than Jill. So, if we can find out how many peaches Steven has, we will be able to calculate how many peaches Jake has. According to the question, Steven has 16 peaches. Now, let's use this information to solve for Jake's number of peaches: Jake has 7 less than Steven, so Jake has 16 - 7 = 9 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 9 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 17 peaches, then Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 peaches. And if Jill has x peaches, then Jake has 10 + 8 = 18 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. So, if we write down what we know about each of them...
Jake - 9 peaches less than Steven = x
Steven - 16 peaches
Jill - 18 peaches more than Jake = x + 18
Now, let's solve for ""x"" (the number of peaches Steven has more than Jill):
x + 18 = 16
Solving for ""x"":
x = 2
So, Steven has 2 more peaches than Jill."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steven. So if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 6 pears. We also know that Steven has 18 more pears than Jill. So if Jill has y pears, then Steven has y + 18 pears. Finally, we are told that Jill has 5 pears. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 6 = y + 18
Solving for x (Jake's number of pears), we get:
x = 12
So Jake has 12 pears."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer peaches than Steven. So, if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x + 5 peaches. Since Steven has more peaches than Jill, we can say that Jill has x - 5 peaches. Now, we are told that Jill has 87 peaches in total. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x - 5 = 87. Solving for x, we get x = 92. So, Jake has 92 peaches more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. So if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 16 peaches. We also know that Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. So if Jill has y peaches, then Steven has y + 15 peaches. Finally, we are told that Jill has 12 peaches less than Jake. So if Jake has z peaches, then Jill has z - 12 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 34 peaches (z - 12) more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and he has 79 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x peaches and y apples, then Jake has x - 12 peaches and y + 79 apples. Now we can substitute the values given in the question: Steven has 19 peaches and 14 apples, so Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches and 14 + 79 = 93 apples. Therefore, Jake has 7 peaches and 93 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven and 3 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples, then Jake has... (do you want to continue with the calculation?)
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x peaches and y apples, then Jake has x - 6 peaches and y + 8 apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x - 6 = 17 (Jake's peach count)
y + 8 = 16 (Steven's apple count)
Now we can solve for y (Steven's apple count):
y = 16 - 8
y = 8
So, Steven has 8 apples more than Jake. To find out how many apples more, we can subtract Jake's apple count from Steven's:
Apple difference = 8 - x
Where x is Jake's apple count. Since Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, his apple count must be equal to or greater than 8. Therefore, the apple difference between them is:
Apple difference = 8 - 6 = 2
Therefore, Steven has 2 more apples than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x peaches and y apples, then Jake has x - 3 peaches and y + 10 apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x = 12 (since Steven has 12 peaches)
x - 3 = 3 (since Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven)
y + 10 = 15 (since Jake has 10 more apples than Steven)
Now we can solve for y (the number of apples):
y = 15 - 10 = 5 (since Jake has 5 more apples than Steven)
So, Steven has 12 peaches and 5 apples. Therefore, Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven, which means Jake has 7 peaches and 15 apples."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 pears and Jill has 67 pears more than Steven. So, if we subtract 67 from 12, we get... (do you want to continue?)
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 pears and Jake has 12 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 6 pears less than Steven. Therefore, Jill has 8 pears more than Jake, which means she has 24 pears (8 + 16). So, Jill has 24 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 pears and Jill has 72 - 12 = 60 pears. So, Jake must have x pears. Since Jake has more pears than Jill, we can write an inequality: x > 60. Moreover, since Jake has fewer pears than Steven, we can write another inequality: x < 19. Therefore, the range of possible values for x is between 60 and 19, inclusive. Hence, Jake has between 60 and 19 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 peaches and Jake has 6 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 peaches. Additionally, we are told that Jake is 3 peaches more than Jill, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 peaches. Therefore, the answer is 11.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples, then Jake has 84 + x apples. Also, we know that Steven has 10 fewer peaches than Jake. So, if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x - 10 peaches. Now, we are given that Steven has 13 peaches and 52 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
x = 13 (since Steven has 13 peaches)
x + 52 = 84 (since Jake has 84 more apples than Steven)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 69
So, Jake has 69 peaches."
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples, then Jake has x + 13 apples. Also, we know that Steven has 17 fewer peaches than Jake. So if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x - 17 peaches. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: Jake has x + 13 = Steven's x - 17. Solving for x (Jake's apples), we get: Jake has 40 apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples and y peaches, then Jake has x - 8 peaches and y + 10 apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x - 8 = y + 10... (1)
We also know that Steven has 11 apples. Therefore, Jake has:
Jake has 11 + (y - 8) = 29 apples... (2)
Now we need to solve for y, which is the number of peaches that Steven has. Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
x - 8 = y + 10
11 + (y - 8) = 29
3 = y + 10
y = 29 - 10
y = 19
So, Steven has 19 peaches. To find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jake, we subtract Jake's number of peaches from Steven's number of peaches:
Steven has 19 peaches, and Jake has 11 peaches less, so Steven has 19 - 11 = 8 more peaches than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven and 4 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples and y peaches, then Jake has x - 3 peaches and y + 4 apples. Since Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, we can set up the equation:
x = 19 (apples)
y = 15 (peaches)
Now, let's solve for y (peaches):
y = x - 3
y = 19 - 3
y = 16
So, Steven has 16 peaches more than Jake."
Response:  Olivia had $78 in her purse and spent $15 at the grocery store. So she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.  
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 and has $33 left, that means she had $78 - $33 = $45 initially.
Response:  Olivia had $100 in her purse and withdrew an additional $148 from an ATM. After visiting the grocery store, she was left with $159. So, she spent $148 + $100 = $248.
"Response:  Olivia had $3 in her purse initially and collected an additional $49 at an ATM. After visiting the grocery store, she had $49 left. So, if she spent $X at the grocery store, then the amount of money she collected from the ATM is equal to $X + $3 (since she started with $3). Therefore, the difference between the amount she collected from the ATM and what she spent at the grocery store is $49 - ($X + $3) = $49 - X$. 
So, the answer is $49 - X$."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $53 in her purse and then she withdrew $91 from an ATM. So, after this transaction, there were $53 + $91 = $144 in her purse. Then, she went to the grocery store and spent some money there. After this, there were only $14 left in her purse. Therefore, the amount of money she spent at the grocery store is equal to $144 - $14 = $130. 
Response:  We know that there were initially $106 in Olivia's purse and after visiting the exhibition hall she had $75 left ($106 - $39 = $75). If she spent $49 at the exhibition hall, then she has $26 left after paying for both places ($75 - $49 = $26). Therefore, she spent $49 at the supermarket.
Response:  Olivia had initially $54 in her purse and spent $29 after visiting the grocery store. So she has $25 left ($54 - $29 = $25).
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the grocery store and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone. So, there are 14 applications remaining on Dave's phone.
Response:  We know that after deleting 18 apps, he had 5 left. So, initially, he must have had 23 apps (5 - 18 = 23).
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 10 apps on his phone and then added 11 new ones, so he had 21 apps in total (10 + 11 = 21). Now, after removing some of them, he was left with 4 apps. So, we can say that he removed 17 apps (21 - 4 = 17).
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and then he added 89 new ones. So, his total number of applications became 21 + 89 = 106. Now, we are asked how many more applications he added than he removed. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of applications he removed from the total number of applications he added. Therefore, the answer is: 106 - 24 = 82. So, Dave added 82 applications more than he removed.
Response:  If Dave had 15 applications initially and added 71 new ones, then he has a total of 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). Now, if he removed some applications, let's say he removed 20, then he would have 66 applications left (86 - 20 = 66). So, the number of additional applications he removed is 20 - 15 = 5.
"Response:  We know that Dave had initially 16 applications and 77 files on his phone. If he has now 5 applications and 23 files, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of initial apps = 16
Number of remaining apps = Initial apps - Number of apps after deletion
= 16 - 5
= 11

Similarly, we can calculate the number of files he had initially and the number of files he has left:

Initial files = 77
Remaining files = Initial files - Number of files after deletion
= 77 - 23
= 54

So, Dave deleted 11 applications and 23 files from his phone."
"Response:  We know that after he had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone initially. Then, he deleted some of them, so we can write an equation as follows:

Number of applications = 17 - x
Where 'x' is the number of applications he deleted.
Similarly, for files:
Number of files = 21 - y
Where 'y' is the number of files he deleted.
Now, we are told that after deleting some applications and files, he has 3 applications left and 7 files left. So, we can substitute these values in the above equations to find out how many applications and files he deleted:
Number of applications = 17 - x = 3
Number of files = 21 - y = 7
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 14 (number of applications deleted)
y = 4 (number of files deleted)
Therefore, Dave deleted 14 applications and 4 files from his phone."
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he has 21 applications and 4 files left. So, the number of applications he deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of applications (15) and the final number of applications (21). Similarly, the number of files he deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of files (24) and the final number of files (4). Therefore, the number of applications he deleted is 15 - 21 = -6, and the number of files he deleted is 24 - 4 = 20.
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he has 6 apps and 15 files left. So, the number of files he deleted is equal to the number of apps he deleted minus the number of apps he still has (6 - 1 = 5). Therefore, he has 5 more files than apps left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications initially and added some more, then he has 18 applications now. So, the number of applications he added is equal to 18 - 17 = 1. Therefore, the answer is 1 application.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 59 files and apps on his phone. If he removed some of them, then he has fewer files and apps now. So, we can write an equation: 59 - x = 12 where x is the number of applications he removed. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 59: x = 12 / 59 = 2. Therefore, Dave removed 2 applications from his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 apps initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So, we can say that he deleted 7 files (24 - 21 = 3) and 6 apps (13 - 17 = -3). Therefore, he suppressed 9 items in total (7 + (-3)).
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he has 5 files and 12 applications left. So, the number of applications he deleted is equal to the number of files he deleted (9 - 5 = 4). Therefore, Dave has 4 more applications than files left on his phone.
Response:  We know that initially Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, the number of files he has now is 24 - 3 = 21 files. And the number of applications he has now is 2 - 1 = 1 application. Therefore, Dave has 21 more files than applications on his phone.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards in total and she gave 136 to Jeff. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Total number of cards = Number of cards given to Jeff
242 = 136 + x
Where 'x' is the number of cards remaining with Nell.
Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can subtract 136 from both sides of the equation:
242 - 136 = x
Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 106
So, there are 106 cards left with Nell."
Response:  We know that Nell had initially 301 cards because she gave 301 to Jeff and now she has only 154 left. So, we can write an equation: 301 = initial number of cards - number of cards given to Jeff. Now, we need to solve for the initial number of cards. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by the number of cards given to Jeff (301 / 301 = x). Therefore, the initial number of cards was x = 602.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has 252 cards left now. If we subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her initial total, we get the number of cards she gave him: 528 - 252 = 276. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer cards now. Let's call the number of cards she has after giving some to Jeff as x. Since Jeff started with 234 cards, he must have received some from Nell. So, his new number of cards is x + 234. Now, we are told that Jeff has 535 cards left. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 234 = 535. Solving for x, we get x = 301. So, Jeff has 301 cards left.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 cards of baseball and 356 cards of 10. So she has a total of 309 + 356 = 665 cards. Now we are told that she gave some cards to Jeff, so she has fewer cards now. Let's assume that she gave him 100 cards (this is just an assumption, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number). So after giving cards to Jeff, Nell has 665 - 100 = 565 cards left. Therefore, Nell has 565 cards of baseball and 356 cards of 10. To find out how many more cards of baseball Nell has than of 10, we can subtract the number of cards of 10 from the total number of cards of baseball: 565 - 356 = 209. So Nell has 209 more cards of baseball than of 10.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 cards of baseball and gave some to Jeff. So, she has 404 cards of baseball left. Now, we are told that she has 214 cards of 10, so she has a total of 618 cards (246 + 214). Therefore, she has 37 more cards of 10 than she does of baseball. 
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave some to John and Jeff. So, she has 573 - 195 = 378 cards left. Then we are told that she gave ""still fewer"" to Jeff. This means that she gave less than 195 cards to Jeff. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is 195 - x, where x is a positive integer. Since x cannot be negative, we can conclude that x = 10 or x = 20. So, Nell gave either 10 or 20 cards to Jeff."
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 cards of baseball and she gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer cards now than before. Also, we know that she has 18 cards of 10, so let's add them to her total number of cards. Now, we can calculate how many more cards of baseball Nell has than cards of 10. The calculation is as follows: Total number of cards = Number of baseball cards - Number of 10 cards = 438 - 18 = 420. Therefore, Nell has 420 more cards of baseball than cards of 10.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 cards of baseball and gave some to Jeff. So, she has 376 cards of 10 now. The difference between her original number of baseball cards (239) and her current number of cards of 10 (376) is 137. Therefore, Nell has 137 more cards of 10 than she has baseball cards.  
Response:  If Paco had 35 cookies at first and he ate 19 of them, then he had 35 - 19 = 16 cookies left after eating some. So, initially, Paco had 16 cookies.
Response:  We know that Paco had 28 cookies initially and he has 7 left after eating some of them. So, we can write an equation as follows: 28 - x = 7, where x is the number of cookies Paco ate. Now, we solve for x by subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation: x = 21. Therefore, Paco ate 21 cookies.
Response:  At first, Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 2 of them, so now he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Then, he bought 37 more cookies, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total. Therefore, there are 75 cookies left at Paco's house.
Response:  At first, Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them, so he has left with 20 cookies. Then, he bought 3 more cookies, so now he has 23 cookies (20 + 3). So, he has eaten more than he has bought. The difference is 3 - 3 = 0 cookies. Therefore, Paco has not eaten any cookie more than what he has bought.
Response:  Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them, so now he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Then, he bought 36 more cookies, so in total, he has 11 + 36 = 47 cookies. Therefore, he bought 47 - 11 = 36 more cookies than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 40 cookies. Then he ate 5 cookies, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Finally, he gave 13 cookies to his friend, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, there are 22 cookies remaining at Paco's house.
Response:  Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them, so he has 17 - 14 = 3 remaining cookies. Then, he gave 13 to his friend, so now he has 3 - 13 = -10 cookies left (he has more cookies than he gave away). So, Paco has eaten 14 + 13 = 27 cookies more than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and ate 16 of them, so he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. Then, he gave his friend 21 cookies, which means that his friend got 21 + (-4) = 17 more cookies than Paco had initially. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco gave to his friend and the number he ate is 17.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 22 biscuits sucrés and 75 biscuits salés. He ate 15 biscuits sucrés, which means he has 22 - 15 = 6 biscuits sucrés left. Similarly, he ate 54 biscuits salés, which means he has 75 - 54 = 21 biscuits salés left. Therefore, there are 6 biscuits sucrés and 21 biscuits salés left with Paco.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 9 biscuits sucrés and 6 biscuits salés. He then ate 36 biscuits sucrés and 3 biscuits salés. So, the total number of biscuits he ate is: 36 + 3 = 40. Now, we need to find out how many biscuits salés he has left. Initially, he had 6 biscuits salés, and he ate 3 of them. So, the number of biscuits salés he has left is: 6 - 3 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 biscuits salés remaining at Paco's disposal.
Response:  We know that Paco had 37 biscuits sucrés and 11 biscuits salés in total. He ate 5 biscuits sucrés and 2 biscuits salés. So, he has now 37 - 5 = 32 biscuits sucrés and 11 - 2 = 9 biscuits salés left. To find out how many more biscuits sucrés than salés he ate, we need to subtract the number of biscuits salés eaten from the number of biscuits sucrés left: 32 - 9 = 23 more biscuits sucrés than salés. Therefore, Paco ate 23 more biscuits sucrés than salés.
Response:  We know that Paco had 8 biscuits sucrés and 6 biscuits salés initially. He then ate 20 biscuits sucrés, which means he has now 8 + 20 = 28 biscuits sucrés in total. Similarly, he ate 34 biscuits salés, which means he has now 6 + 34 = 40 biscuits salés in total. So, the difference between the number of salty biscuits he had after eating them and the number of sweet biscuits he had after eating them is:  40 - 28 = 12. Therefore, Paco ate 12 more salty biscuits than sweet biscuits.
Response:  If Paco had initially 37 cookies and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 cookie left. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  Paco had 36 cookies initially and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Then, he ate 10 cookies, so now he has 22 - 10 = 12 cookies left. Therefore, there are 12 cookies remaining at Paco's disposal.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then, he ate 18 of them, so he has 32 - 18 = 14 cookies left. Therefore, he ate 14 more cookies than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paco had 6 cookies initially and gave 30 to his friend. So, he has given a total of 30 + 6 = 36 cookies to his friend. Now, we are told that he has eaten 23 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left with him is 36 - 23 = 13 cookies. Hence, Paco gave his friend 13 more cookies than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 97 biscuits (salés + sucrés) = 97 x 2 = 194 biscuits. Then he ate 15 biscuits sucrés, so now he has 194 - 15 = 179 biscuits salés. Finally, he ate 56 more biscuits salés, so now he has 179 + 56 = 235 biscuits salés left. Therefore, there are 0 biscuits sucrés left at Paco's place.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 26 biscuits salés and 17 biscuits sucrés (a total of 43 biscuits). Then he ate 14 biscuits sucrés and 9 biscuits salés. So, we can write an equation: 14 + 9 = x, where x is the number of biscuits salés remaining with Paco. Now, we solve for x: x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 biscuits salés remaining with Paco.
Response:  We know that initially Paco had 39 biscuits sucrés and 6 biscuits salés. So he had a total of 45 biscuits (39 sucrés + 6 salés). Then we are told that he ate 23 biscuits salés. This means that he has now 45 - 23 = 22 biscuits salés left. Now we are also told that he ate 32 biscuits sucrés. This means that he has now 39 - 32 = 7 biscuits sucrés left. Therefore, Paco ate more biscuits sucrés than biscuits salés. The difference between the number of biscuits sucrés eaten and the number of biscuits salés eaten is 32 - 23 = 9. So, Paco ate 9 more biscuits sucrés than biscuits salés.
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 biscuits in total (25 biscuits salés + 15 biscuits sucrés). He ate 28 biscuits salés, so he has 12 biscuits salés left (40 - 28 = 12). Now we need to find out how many biscuits sucrés he had after eating them. Since he ate 15 biscuits sucrés and he had 15 biscuits sucrés initially, nothing changed. So, he still has 15 biscuits sucrés. Therefore, the difference between the number of biscuits salés he ate and the number of biscuits sucrés he ate is 28 - 15 = 13. Hence, he ate 13 more biscuits salés than sucrés.
Response:  If Gwen received $7 and spent some of it, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $\$5 - \$7 = \$2$.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $X dollars for her birthday and she spent $8 of it. So, we can write an equation as follows: X - $8 = $6. Now, let's solve for X: X = $6 + $8 = $14. Therefore, Gwen received $14 dollars for her birthday.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mom and her dad gave her $4 more, so she has a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
Response:  If Gwen received $8 from her mom and her dad gave her an additional $5, then she has a total of $13 ($8 + $5). If she spent $4, that means she has $9 left ($13 - $4). So, her mom gave her more money than her dad did. The difference between what her mom gave her and what her dad gave her is $9.
Response:  If Gwen received $3 from her mom and spent $4, then she has $3 - $4 = $-1 left. Now, her father gave her $6 more than what her mother gave her, so her father gave her $6 + $3 = $9. Therefore, Gwen now has $9 - $4 = $5 extra money from her father compared to what her mother gave her.
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and spent $4, then she has $9 left ($5 - $4 = $9). Now, if her mother gave her $7 more than what her father gave her, that means her mother gave her $12 ($7 + $5 = $12). So, in total, Gwen has $9 + $12 = $21.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she had a total of $7 to start with ($5 + $2). If she spent $6, then she must have received an additional amount of money from either her father or her mother. Since she spent $6, it means that she received at least $6 - $6 = $0 from her father and $6 - $2 = $4 from her mother. So, Gwen received $4 more from her father than from her mother.
Response:  We know that Josh had 9 billes in his collection initially. Then he lost some billes, so now he has 4 billes left. To find out how many billes he lost, we can subtract the number of billes he has now from the initial number of billes he had: 9 - 4 = 5. So, Josh lost 5 billes.
"Response:  We know that Josh had some number of balls in his collection initially (call it x). Then he lost 21 balls. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 21 = 12
Now solve for x using subtraction:
x = 12 + 21
x = 33
Therefore, Josh had 33 balls in his collection initially."
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 billes in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them, so he had 8 billes left (19 - 11 = 8). After that, he found 5 new billes, so now he has 13 billes (8 + 5 = 13) in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.
Response:  We know that Josh had 4 billes in his collection initially and then he lost 16 billes. So, he had 4 - 16 = -12 billes left. Now, he found 8 new billes, so he has +8 = 6 billes now. Therefore, he lost more billes than he found, i.e., -12 > 6, which means he lost 6 billes more than he found. 
Response:  We know that Josh had 7 billes in his collection and he lost 8 of them. So, he has 7 - 8 = -1 bille left. Now, we are told that he found 10 new billes. Therefore, the total number of billes he now has is 7 + 10 = 17 billes. Since he had fewer billes after finding new ones than he did before losing some, the difference between the two numbers is positive. So, the answer is 17 - 8 = 9 billes.
Response:  At first, Josh had 21 billes in his collection. Then he found 7 billes. So now he has 21 + 7 = 28 billes in his collection. Therefore, Josh has 28 billes now.
Response:  Josh had 20 billes in his collection initially. Then he gave 2 billes to Jack. So now, Josh has 20 - 2 = 18 billes left in his collection. Therefore, Josh has 18 billes now.
"Response:  We know that Josh had initially 22 bullets in his collection and then Jack gave him 20 bullets. So, now we need to find out how many bullets Josh has after receiving those 20 bullets from Jack. To do this, we can simply subtract the number of bullets given to him (20) from the total number of bullets he originally had (22):
Josh has 22 - 20 = 2 bullets left in his collection after receiving them from Jack."
Response:  If Josh had 19 balls in his collection before and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8). So, he now has 8 balls in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 billes in his collection. Then he found 13 more and added them to his collection. So, now he has 22 + 13 = 35 billes. However, he lost 5 billes, so he has 35 - 5 = 30 billes left in his collection. Therefore, Josh has 30 billes in his collection right now.
Response:  If Josh had 15 billes in his collection initially and found 9 more, then he now has 15 + 9 = 24 billes. However, if he lost 23 billes, then he would have 24 - 23 = 1 bille left in his collection. So, he lost 23 billes more than the number of billes he found. Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  At first, Josh had 3 balls in his collection. Then he found 6 more balls but lost 5 of them. So, if we subtract the number of balls he lost (5) from the total number of balls he found (6), we get 1 ball that he found and didn't lose. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father had picked 4 pounds of strawberries. Then we are told that Marco alone had picked 19 pounds of strawberries. So, to find out how much more weight Marco's strawberries were than those of his father, we can subtract the amount of strawberries his father had from the total amount of strawberries they both had: 
19 - 4 = 15 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries were 15 pounds heavier than those of his father."
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father had picked 35 pounds of strawberries. Since Marco had picked 13 pounds of strawberries himself, we can say that his father must have picked 22 pounds (35 - 13 = 22).
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father had collected 20 pounds of strawberries. Since his father's strawberries weighed 17 pounds, then Marco's strawberries must have weighed 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3).
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father's strawberries is equal to the sum of their individual weights. So, if Marco's strawberries weigh 8 pounds, then his father's strawberries must weigh 4 times as much, or 32 pounds x 4 = 128 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of Marco and his father's strawberries together is 8 + 128 = 136 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back, Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, so he now has 3 pounds left. To find out how much strawberries his father had, we can simply subtract the weight of the strawberries Marco lost from the total amount they collected: 24 - 9 = 15 pounds. So, the strawberries his father had were 15 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. Then, when they returned home, Marco's father lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So, Marco now has 12 pounds of strawberries left. To find out how much his father has left, we can simply subtract 8 pounds from 36 pounds, which gives us 28 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the remaining strawberries belonging to Marco's father is 28 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 22 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back, his father found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. So, in total, they have 52 pounds of strawberries (22 + 30 = 52). Therefore, the weight of the strawberries left with Marco is 36 pounds minus 52 pounds, which equals -16 pounds (-36 - 52 = -16). So, the weight of the remaining strawberries with Marco's father is 16 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have collected 37 pounds of strawberries. If Marco's strawberries weigh 15 pounds, then his father's strawberries must weigh 22 pounds (37 - 15 = 22).
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have picked 17 pounds of strawberries. So, if Marco had picked X pounds of strawberries, then his father must have picked 17 - X pounds of strawberries. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds more than his father's, we can write:
X + (30) = 17... (1)
Now we need to solve for X. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
X + 30 = 17
Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:
X = 47
So, Marco's strawberries weighed 47 pounds more than his father's."
Response:  We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds and his father's strawberries together with his own weighed 26 pounds more than his. So, if M = 10, then F = 26 - 10 = 16 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's strawberries is 16 pounds.
Response:  We know that the total weight of Marco and his father's strawberries is 30 pounds (lb). Since Marco's father's strawberries weighed 11 lb, then Marco's strawberries must have weighed 29 lb (30 - 11 = 29).
Response:  Before stopping at the bus stop, there were 2 children in the bus. After other children got on the bus, there are now 10 children in the bus altogether. So, the difference between the number of children before and after getting off is 8 (10 - 2). Therefore, there are 8 more children in the bus after getting off than there were before.
Response:  The initial number of children in the bus is 26. Then, 38 other children get into the bus, increasing its total number to 64 (26 + 38). So, there are now 64 children in the bus.
Response:  The number of children who were already in the bus at the start is given as 30. Then, 2 more children got into the bus after the stop (as mentioned in the question). So, the total number of children in the bus at the end is 30 + 2 = 32. Therefore, the number of children who were getting into the bus before the stop is 32 - 30 = 2.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 43 - x = 21 where x is the number of children who got off the bus. Now solve for x using subtraction. x = 43 - 21 = 22 So, 22 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. After some of them got off at the stop, there are now 18 children left in the bus. So, to find out how many more children were in the bus before they got off, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children. Therefore, the answer is: 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus, leaving 11 children inside. Finally, 4 new children boarded the bus, so there are 15 children left (including the original 11). Therefore, 4 children mounted the bus at the stop.
Response:  The number of children who were initially sitting in the bus is given as 5. Then, 63 children descended from the bus and 14 children entered it, so the final number of children in the bus is 14 + 63 = 77. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off the bus (63) and those who boarded it (14) is 63 - 14 = 50.
Response:  The number of children who were initially in the bus is given as 36. Then, at the next stop, 68 children got off the bus and 40 new children boarded it. So, the final number of children in the bus was 12 (the initial number minus those who got off). Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who boarded is 54 (68 - 40). Hence, 54 children descended from the bus more than those who ascended.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 more got into it. So, the total number of children in the bus after some time was 62 (22 + 40). Now, we are told that there were only 2 children left in the bus at the next stop. Therefore, the number of children who descended from the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children, i.e., 60 (62 - 2).
Response:  At first, there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 more children got into the bus while some left it. So, initially, there were 110 children (28 + 82) in the bus. Then, after some children left the bus, there were only 30 children remaining in it. Therefore, the number of children who got into the bus is equal to the number of children who left it, i.e., 52 (110 - 30).
Response:  At first, there were 23 children in the bus and then 24 more got into it. So, initially, there were 23 + 24 = 47 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off the bus, leaving 8 children behind. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on is 8 - (24 - 23) = 8 - 1 = 7 children.
"Response:  If the baker made 133 gingerbread cookies and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than those that he sold. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of gingerbread cookies made = Number of gingerbread cookies sold + X
Where X is the number of extra gingerbread cookies made by the baker.
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

133 - 51 = X
Solving for X, we get:
X = 82
Therefore, the baker made 82 additional gingerbread cookies beyond what he sold."
Response:  The baker made 54 cookies and sold some of them. If he has 13 left, then he must have sold x = 54 - 13 = 41 cookies.
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 145 gâteaux and he still has 72 left. So, if he made x gâteaux initially, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 145 = 72
Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations.
x = 285
Therefore, the baker has made 285 gâteaux initially."
Response:  The baker made 155 gâteaux in total. If his friend buys 140 of them, then he will have 15 - 140 = -135 gâteaux left. So, the baker will have -135 gâteaux left after his friend buys some.
Response:  The baker has made 121 gingerbread cookies and sold 105 of them. This means he still has 16 (121 - 105) gingerbread cookies left. Then, he bought 170 new gingerbread cookies. So, in total, the baker now has 336 (16 + 170) gingerbread cookies.
Response:  The baker has made 13 gâteaux and sold 91 of them, so he has 40 (13 - 91) gâteaux left. Then, he bought 154 new ones, so he now has 204 (40 + 154) gâteaux in total. Therefore, the number of gâteaux the baker has acquired is 204 - 40 = 164 more than the number he sold.  
Response:  The baker has made 170 gingerbread cookies and sold 78 of them. This means he still has 92 gingerbread cookies left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new gingerbread cookies. So, now he has 92 + 31 = 123 gingerbread cookies in total. Therefore, the baker has sold more gingerbread cookies than he has purchased by 123 - 92 = 31 cookies.
Response:  The baker made 110 gâteaux initially and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 remaining (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made 76 more gâteaux. Therefore, the total number of gâteaux the baker now has is 35 + 76 = 111 gâteaux.
Response:  The baker made 144 gingerbread cookies and sold 71 of them. Then he made 111 more gingerbread cookies. So, in total, the baker has made 255 gingerbread cookies (144 + 111). To find out how many more gingerbread cookies the baker has made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of gingerbread cookies he sold from the total number of gingerbread cookies he made: 255 - 71 = 184. Therefore, the baker has made 184 more gingerbread cookies than those he sold.
"Response:  The baker made 149 gâteaux and 91 pâtisseries in total. If he sells 10 gâteaux and 90 pâtisseries, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many gâteaux the baker has left after selling 10 gâteaux.
Gâteaux = Total gâteaux - Sold gâteaux (10)
= 149 - 10
= 139 gâteaux
Step 2: Calculate how many pâtisseries the baker has left after selling 90 pâtisseries.
Pâtisseries = Total pâtisseries - Sold pâtisseries (90)
= 91 - 90
= 1 pâtisserie
Therefore, the baker will have 139 gâteaux and 1 pâtisserie left after selling 10 gâteaux and 90 pâtisseries."
Response:  The baker made 7 gâteaux and 148 pâtisseries in total. If he sells 15 gâteaux and 103 pâtisseries, then we have to find out how many pâtisseries the baker has left. We can do this by subtracting the number of pâtisseries sold from the initial amount: Number of pâtisseries left = Initial amount - Sold amount = 148 - (15 + 103) = 148 - 128 = 20 So, the baker has 20 pâtisseries left.
"Response:  The total number of baked goods made by the baker is given as 126 + 48 = 174. If he sold 115 gâteaux and 81 pâtisseries, then the difference between the number of gâteaux he sold and the number of pâtisseries he sold is:

115 - 81 = 34

So, the baker has made 34 more gâteaux than pâtisseries."
"Response:  The baker made 19 gâteaux and 131 pâtisseries in total. If he sold 70 gâteaux and 88 pâtisseries, then we can calculate how many more pâtisseries than gâteaux the baker made as follows:
Number of pâtisseries made - Number of pâtisseries sold = Number of extra pâtisseries made
= 131 - (70 + 88)
= 131 - 168
= -37
So, the baker made 37 more pâtisseries than gâteaux."
"Response:  According to the question, the baker made 157 gâteaux and 169 pâtisseries. If he sold 158 gâteaux and 147 pâtisseries, then we can calculate how many more gâteaux than pâtisseries the baker sold as follows:

Number of gâteaux sold = 158
Number of pâtisseries sold = 147
Difference between number of gâteaux and pâtisseries sold = Number of gâteaux sold - Number of pâtisseries sold
= 158 - 147
= 11

Therefore, the baker sold 11 more gâteaux than pâtisseries."
Response:  The baker has made 54 gâteaux and 143 pâtisseries, so he has sold 68 gâteaux and 92 pâtisseries. To find out how many more pâtisseries than gâteaux the baker has sold, we need to subtract the number of gâteaux sold from the total number of pâtisseries sold: 92 - 68 = 24. So, the baker has sold 24 more pâtisseries than gâteaux.
Response:  If the baker had initially made 48 gâteaux and sold 44 of them, then he has 48 - 44 = 14 remaining gâteaux.
Response:  If the baker initially made 40 gâteaux and sold 8 of them, then he must have made 40 - 8 = 32 more gâteaux than those he sold. So, the number of additional gâteaux the baker made is 32.
Response:  If l'ami du boulanger had initially bought 169 gâteaux and then bought 137 more from the baker, that means he has bought a total of 169 + 137 = 306 gâteaux. So, the baker still has 169 - 306 = -137 gâteaux left.
Response:  The baker has made 173 gingerbread cookies and bought 103 new ones. So he now has 276 (173 + 103) gingerbread cookies in total. He sold 86 of them, so he still has 190 gingerbread cookies left (276 - 86 = 190).
"Response:  The baker has made 99 gingerbread cookies and bought 167 new ones. He sold 89 of them. So, to find out how many more gingerbread cookies the baker bought than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of gingerbread cookies he sold from the number of gingerbread cookies he bought:

Number of gingerbread cookies the baker bought - Number of gingerbread cookies the baker sold = 167 - 89 = 78
So, the baker bought 78 more gingerbread cookies than those he sold."
"Response:  The baker has bought 139 new bread rolls and sold 145 of them. So he has sold more than he has bought. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of bread rolls he has bought from the number of bread rolls he has sold:

Sold - Bought = 6 (or 145 - 139)
Therefore, the baker has sold 6 more bread rolls than he has bought."
Response:  The baker made 62 cookies initially and then added another 149 to make a total of 211 cookies. He sold 144 of them, leaving him with 70 cookies (211 - 144 = 70). So, the baker has 70 gâteaux left.
"Response:  The baker made 81 gingerbread cookies initially and then added 92 more. He sold 46 of them. So, to find out how many more gingerbread cookies the baker made than he sold, we need to subtract the number of gingerbread cookies he sold from the total number of gingerbread cookies he made.
Let X be the total number of gingerbread cookies the baker made (including both those he sold and those he didn't sell). Then, we can write the equation as follows:
X - 46 = 81 + 92
Simplifying the equation, we get:
X = 135
So, the baker made 135 gingerbread cookies in total, including those he sold and those he didn't sell."
Response:  The baker made 61 pies and 167 cakes for a total of 228 pastries and cakes. If he sold 108 cakes and 44 pies, then he has left with 228 - (108 + 44) = 136 pastries and cakes. So, the baker will have 136 gâteaux still.
Response:  The baker made 56 pies and 124 cakes for a total of 180 pastries/cakes. If he sold 104 cakes and 29 pies, then he has left with 76 pies (180 - 104 = 76).
Response:  The baker made 52 pies and 84 cakes for a total of 136 items (pies + cakes). If he sold 102 cakes and 94 pies, then he must have made more cakes than pies. So, the difference between the number of cakes he made and the number of pies he made is equal to the number of additional cakes he made. Therefore, the answer is 7 (cakes) - 7 (pies) = 0.
Response:  The baker made 134 pies and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pies, then... (134 + 11) =...(245). So, the baker has made more pies than cakes. Therefore, the difference between the number of pies and cakes is 245 - 11 = 234.
Response:  The baker made 14 gâteaux and 153 pâtisseries in total. If he sold 8 pâtisseries and 97 gâteaux, then we can calculate how many more gâteaux than pâtisseries the baker has sold as follows: Number of gâteaux sold = Total number of gâteaux - Number of gâteaux sold = 14 - (8 + 97) = 14 - 105 = -91 gâteaux Sold Number of pâtisseries sold = Total number of pâtisseries - Number of pâtisseries sold = 153 - (8 + 97) = 153 - 105 = 48 pâtisseries sold So, the baker has sold 91 fewer gâteaux than pâtisseries.
"Response:  According to the question, the baker made 43 gâteaux and 114 pâtisseries. If he sold 154 pâtisseries and 78 gâteaux, then we can calculate how many more pâtisseries than gâteaux he sold as follows:
Number of pâtisseries sold = 154
Number of gâteaux sold = 78
Difference between number of pâtisseries and gâteaux sold = Number of pâtisseries sold - Number of gâteaux sold
= 154 - 78
= 76
Therefore, the baker sold 76 more pâtisseries than gâteaux."
"Response:  If Kelly has $22 to spend and she wants to have at least $140 left over after buying games for her Nintendo, we can set up an equation as follows:

$22 = x (where x is the number of games Kelly can buy)

To find out how many games Kelly can buy, we need to divide both sides of the equation by $22:

x / $22 = 140 / $22

Now we can solve for x:

x = 140 / $22

So, Kelly can buy 6 games ($140 / $22)."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games and gives away 64 of them, then she will have 42 remaining (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  If Kelly had initially 91 games and now has 92, then she must have gained 1 game. So, her initial number of games was 91 - 1 = 90.
"Response:  Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To find out how many games she needs to give away from her Nintendo collection so that she will have 12 games left, we can use the following equation:
Number of games Kelly must give away = Total number of games she has - Desired number of games she wants to have after giving them away
In this case, Number of games Kelly must give away = 20 - 12 = 8
So, Kelly needs to give away 8 games from her Nintendo collection for her to have 12 games left."
"Response:  Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and needs to give 31 games away. To find out how many games she must give away, we can divide the number of games she has (46) by the number she wants to have after giving some away (31):

Number of games Kelly must give away = Number of games she has / Number she wants to have after giving some away
= 46 / 31
= 15
Therefore, Kelly must give away 15 games from her collection of Sony PlayStation games."
Response:  If Kelly had 80 games and found 31 more, then she now has 80 + 31 = 111 games in total. To find out how many games she will have after giving 6 to her friend, we can subtract 6 from 111: 111 - 6 = 105 games. So, Kelly should give $105 to her friend.
Response:  If Randy had x blocks at first and used them to build a tower of height y, then he must have used x - 52 = 38 blocks for the tower. So, x = 90.
Response:  We know that Randy has used some blocks to build a tower and he is left with 72 blocks. So, we can say that the number of blocks used for building the tower is equal to the number of blocks left with him minus the total number of blocks he had initially. Mathematically, it can be represented as: Number of blocks used = Total number of blocks - Remaining blocks Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of blocks = 97 (as per the question) Remaining blocks = 72 (as per the question) Therefore, Number of blocks used = 97 - 72 = 25 blocks Thus, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total and he used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows: 79 = 14 + 11. Now, let's solve for the number of remaining blocks: 64 = 53 (since 14 + 11 = 53). Therefore, there are 64 blocks left over after building the tower and the house.
Response:  The number of blocks used to build the tower is 27 and for building the house it is 53. So, in total he has used 27 + 53 = 80 blocks. Therefore, the answer is 80 blocks.
Response:  The number of blocks used to build the tower is 37 - 33 = 4 more than the number of blocks used to build the house. Therefore, Randy has used 4 additional blocks to build the tower compared to the house.
"Response:  The difference between the number of blocks used to build the house and the tower is equal to the number of blocks used to build the house minus the number of blocks used to build the tower. So we can write this as follows: 
House - Tower = House + Tower
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
82 - 79 = x + 79
Solving for ""x"", or the number of additional blocks used to build the house compared to the tower, we get:
x = 3
Therefore, Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
Response:  If Randy has 59 blocks and he uses 36 of them to build a tower, then how many blocks does he have left? We can calculate this as follows: Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for building the tower = 59 - 36 = 23 blocks So, Randy has 23 blocks left.
"Response:  The total number of blocks used to build the house is 20 blocs and for building the tower it is 50 blocs. So, we can write this as follows:
House = 20 blocs
Tower = 50 - 20 = 30 blocs
Therefore, the difference in the number of blocks used to build the tower compared to the house is 30 blocs."
"Response:  The number of blocks used to build the house is 89 and for the tower it is 63. So we have:
House - Tower = Number of blocks used in the house minus the number of blocks used in the tower.
= 89 - 63
= 26
Therefore, Randy has used 26 additional blocks to build the house compared to the tower."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 books in total in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If we haven't read 5 of them yet, then the number of books we have already read is equal to 20 - 5 = 15. So, the answer is 15."
"Response:  We know that there are currently 13 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"" that you have read. This means that there are 8 - 13 = 5 books left to read in the series. So, there are 5 books in the Crazy Silly School series."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and you have already read 12 of them. So, the number of books left to read is:

22 - 12 = 10

So, you have 10 books left to read from the series ""Crazy Silly School."""
"Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 films in total. If we have read 19 books, then we still need to watch 8 films (4 - 19 = 8). So, there are 8 films left for us to watch from the series ""Crazy Silly School."""
Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series Crazy Silly School. If you read 19 of the books and watched 13 of the films, then we can say that you have not read or watched all the books and films in the series. So, the number of books that you did not read is equal to the number of films that you did not watch. In other words, the difference between the number of books you read (19) and the number of films you watched (13) gives us the total number of books in the series minus the total number of films in the series. Therefore, the answer is: Books - Films = 19 - 13 = 6. So, there are six more books than films in the series Crazy Silly School.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies, then we can say that there are 42 movies left to watch (61 - 19 = 42). So, there are 42 more movies than books in the series Crazy Silly School. Therefore, the answer is 42.
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in the series. If we have read 13 books and watched 12 films, then we have not read any more books than films. So, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 films in the series. If we have read 7 books, then we have seen 7 x 11 = 77 films. So, we have watched more films than books. Therefore, the answer is 77 - 21 = 56 films.
"Response:  We know that we have read 8 books from the series ""Crazy Silly School"" so far. To find out how many books are left to read, we need to subtract the number of books we have already read from the total number of books in the series. According to the question, there are 14 books in the series. So, if we subtract the number of books we have already read (8) from the total number of books (14), we get: 14 - 8 = 6. Therefore, we have 6 books left to read from the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different books in the series and you have read 4 of them. So, the number of books left to read is:

62 - 4 = 58

So, you have 58 books left to read from the series."
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies in total and you have watched 4 of them. So, the number of movies left to watch is 8 - 4 = 4.
Response:  We know that there are 15 books and 14 films in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have read 11 of the books, then we can say that there are 4 (15 - 11) more books left to read. Similarly, if you have watched 40 of the films, then there are 10 (14 - 40) more films left to watch. Therefore, there are 4 more books than films in the series Crazy Silly School. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have read 13 of the books and watched 63 of the movies, then we can calculate how many more movies than books there are as follows: Number of movies = 63 - 13 = 50 More movies than books. Therefore, there are 50 more movies than books in the series Crazy Silly School.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If we have read 14 films and watched 19 books, then we have read 5 more books than films. Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If we have read 19 films and watched 16 books, then we have read 3 films more than we have watched (19 - 16 = 3). So, we have read 3 films more than we have watched."
Response:  If Dave has won 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 1 ticket for that purpose (since he cannot use fewer than 1 ticket). So, the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys is 1. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 tickets remain with Dave.
Response:  If Dave has won 15 tickets at the amusement park and he used 12 of them to buy toys, then he still has 3 tickets left (15 - 12 = 3). So, Dave has gained 3 tickets at the amusement park.
Response:  If Dave had won 18 tickets and used 5 to buy toys, he has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left. Then, if he used 11 more tickets to buy clothes, he has 13 - 11 = 2 tickets left. So, Dave has 2 tickets remaining.
Response:  If Dave used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 more for clothes, then he has used a total of 12 + 7 = 19 tickets. So, Dave used 1 ticket less for buying clothes than for buying toys. Therefore, the difference between the number of tickets used for buying clothes and toys is 1.
Response:  If Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys and 18 more for clothes, then he has used a total of 26 tickets (8 + 18) for clothes. So, he has used 26 - 8 = 18 tickets more for clothes than for toys.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2, he will have 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. Then, if he used 10 of those tickets to buy toys, he will be left with 12 - 10 = 2 tickets. So, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  We know that initially, Haley had planted 14 trees in her garden and after the storm, 9 of them died. So, the number of alive trees is 14 - 9 = 5. Now we are told that more trees died during the storm than those that survived. Therefore, the total number of dead trees is equal to the number of alive trees + 9 (the difference between the initial number of trees and the number of alive trees). Hence, the answer is 5 + 9 = 14.
Response:  We know that Haley had planted 13 trees in her garden and after the storm, 6 of them died. So, the number of alive trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, 7 trees have survived more than those who died.
Response:  We know that Haley had planted 20 trees in his garden and after the storm, only 4 trees were left standing. So, we can say that 16 trees died during the storm (i.e., 20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, the answer is 16.
"Response:  If Haley has planted x trees and after the storm, there are y trees left, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = y - 5
Now, we know that y = 12 (the number of trees remaining). So, putting this value in the above equation, we get:
x = 12 - 5
x = 7
Therefore, Haley had planted 7 trees in her garden."
Response:  At first, Haley had 9 trees in her garden and after the storm, 4 of them died, so she has 9 - 4 = 5 trees left. Then, she planted 5 more trees, so now she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in her garden.
"Response:  If Haley had initially planted 12 trees and 2 have died after the storm, then the number of trees left is:

12 - 2 = 10

So, there are 10 trees left in Haley's garden after the storm."
Response:  If initially Haley had 3 trees that survived the storm and now 13 have died, then the total number of trees in her garden before the storm was 3 + 13 = 16. So, the difference between the number of dead trees (13) and the number of living trees (3) is equal to 10. Therefore, 10 more trees are dead than alive after the storm.
Response:  We know that after the typhoon, 2 trees in Haley's garden died. So initially, there were 11 - 2 = 9 trees. Now we are asked how many more trees have survived than those that died. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of dead trees from the initial total number of trees. Therefore, the answer is 9 - 2 = 7 trees have survived.
"Response:  If they collect 66 bags per day and each bag contains 28 oranges, then... (1)
The total number of oranges collected in one day is equal to the number of bags multiplied by the number of oranges in each bag. Therefore, we can write:
(1) 66 bags / day × 28 oranges/bag = Total number of oranges collected/day
Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into equation (1):
(1) 66 bags / day × 28 oranges/bag = Total number of oranges collected/day
Substituting the values given in the problem:
Total number of oranges collected/day = 66 bags / day × 28 oranges/bag
= 1792 oranges/day
Therefore, they collect 1792 oranges per day."
Response:  If they collect 8 bags per day, it means that in one week (7 days), they will collect 8 x 7 = 56 bags of oranges. To collect 24 bags, it would take them approximately 24 / 56 = 43 days. Therefore, the answer is 43 days.
Response:  If they collect 56 bags of oranges in total and it takes them 4 days to harvest them, then they will collect how many bags per day? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of bags collected / Number of days taken to collect = Daily bag collection. So, 56 bags / 4 days = 14 bags per day. Therefore, they collect 14 bags of oranges per day.
Response:  After 49 days of orange harvesting, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1752 sacs of oranges.
Response:  After 87 days of orange harvesting, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5904 oranges.
Response:  We know that they collect 8 bags per day and each bag contains 35 oranges. So, in one day, they collect 8 x 35 = 280 oranges. Therefore, they collect 280 oranges per day.  
Response:  If they collect 16 bags per day and each bag contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will collect 16 x 57 = 902 oranges. To gather 80 bags of oranges, it will take them 80 / 902 = 8.84 days. Therefore, it will take approximately 8.84 days to harvest 80 bags of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 67 bags per day and each bag contains 12 oranges, then in one day they will collect 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. To find out how many oranges are collected in total, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of oranges collected per day: 35 bags / 804 oranges per day = 429 oranges. Therefore, 429 oranges are collected in total.
Response:  The farmer collects 74 bags of oranges per day and throws away 71 bags. So he has 3 bags more than he threw away. After 51 days, he will have 3 x 51 = 153 bags of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 76 bags per day and throw away 64 bags, then the total number of bags collected is 76 - 64 = 12. Since each bag contains 50 oranges, the total number of oranges collected is 12 x 50 = 600 oranges per day. Therefore, the answer is 600 oranges per day.
Response:  After 26 days of orange harvesting, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 704 mature oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 immature oranges. Therefore, after 26 days, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of orange harvesting, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 mature oranges and 61 x 25 = 1525 immature oranges. So, in total, they will have 3575 oranges.
Response:  After 45 days of orange harvesting, they will have collected 24 x 45 = 1050 non-matured oranges. Therefore, after 45 days, they will have 1050 - 31 = 719 non-matured oranges left to collect.
"Response:  We know that they collect 44 bags of ripe oranges and 25 bags of unripe oranges each day. So, if we subtract the number of unripe oranges from the total number of oranges collected per day, we get the number of ripe oranges collected daily. Therefore, the difference between the total number of oranges collected and the number of unripe oranges is equal to the number of ripe oranges collected daily. 
So, the number of ripe oranges collected daily = Total number of oranges collected - Number of unripe oranges collected = 44 + 25 = 69. 
Therefore, there are 69 bags of ripe oranges collected daily."
Response:  We know that 74 sacs of unripe oranges are collected every day. So, if we subtract this number from 50 bags of ripe oranges per day, we get 24 bags of unripe oranges collected daily (50 - 74 = -24). Therefore, there are 24 more bags of unripe oranges than ripe oranges collected each day.
"Response:  If they collected 54 bags of oranges in total and they collect 18 bags per day, then it took them how many days to collect those oranges?

Step 1: Convert the number of bags from ""sacs"" to ""bags"".

1 sac = 18 bags (based on the information provided)

So, 54 sacs = 54 x 18 = 972 bags

Now we have the total number of bags that were collected in total.

Step 2: Divide the total number of bags by the number of bags collected per day to find out how many days it took to collect them.

Number of days = Total number of bags / Number of bags collected per day
= 972 bags / 18 bags/day
= 54 days

Therefore, it took them 54 days to collect 54 bags of oranges if they collected 18 bags per day."
"Response:  If they collected 56 bags of oranges in total and they worked for 14 days, then we can calculate how many bags they collected per day as follows:
Total number of bags = Total working days x Number of bags per day
= 14 x 4 (since there are 4 working days in a week)
= 56
So, they collected 56 bags of oranges per day."
Response:  After 73 days of orange harvesting, they will have collected 5 x 73 = 365 bags of mature oranges. Therefore, their total collection after 73 days will be 25 x 73 + 365 = 490 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 6 = 36 non-matured orange bags. So, after 6 days, they will have 65 - 36 = 29 non-matured orange bags left to collect.
"Response:  We know that the total number of sacs of oranges collected per day is 41 + 86 = 127. So, if they collect more mature oranges than immature ones, we can say that the number of mature oranges collected per day is greater than 127. Therefore, the difference between the number of mature and immature oranges collected per day is equal to 127. 
So, the number of mature oranges collected per day is 127 - 35 = 92."
"Response:  We know that they collect 71 unripe orange bags and 60 ripe orange bags per day. So, we can write this as follows:
71 + 60 = 131
Now, let's subtract the number of ripe oranges from the total number of oranges collected to find out how many more unripe oranges are collected than ripe ones:
131 - 60 = 71
Therefore, 71 more unripe oranges are collected than ripe ones each day."
Response:  We know that the length of Jesse's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer it is than wide, we need to subtract these two values. So, the difference between the length and width of Jesse's room is: 12 - 11 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is one foot longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that the length of Jesse's room is 7 feet = 84 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). So, we can start with this information to find out how wide the room needs to be for the given area of the rug. To calculate the width of the room needed for the rug, we use the formula: Length x Width = Area of Rug. Since the area of the rug is 14 feet x 12 inches/foot = 168 square feet, and since the length of the room is 84 inches, we need to divide the area of the rug by its length to get the width of the room: 168 sq ft / 84 in = 20.5 inches. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 20.5 inches or 1.7 feet.
Response:  The length of the chamber is given as 7 feet wide = 8.5 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard). So, to find out how long the room is overall, we multiply its width by its length: 8.5 x 12 = 102 feet. Therefore, the length of the room is 102 feet.
Response:  The room measures 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, so its area is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since it already has 160 square feet of carpeting, we need an additional 5 square feet to cover the entire floor. Therefore, the chamber needs 5 square feet more of carpeting.  
Response:  The room measures 2 feet x 12 feet = 24 square feet. Since each square foot is divided into 4 square feet, we need to divide 24 by 4 to get the number of squares needed for the floor. So, there are 6 squares (or 6 x 4 = 24 square feet) needed to cover the entire floor.
"Response:  The length of each room is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet. So, to find out how much carpeting she needs for all rooms, we need to multiply the number of rooms by their lengths and widths. There are 20 rooms in total, so we can calculate as follows:
Length x Width = Area of one room (in square feet)
Area of one room = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 342 square feet
Since there are 20 rooms in total, the area of the entire floor is: Total Area = Number of Rooms x Area of One Room
Total Area = 20 x 342 = 6,840 square feet
So, Jesse needs 6,840 square feet of carpeting to cover the floors of all 20 rooms."
Response:  We know that the width of Jesse's room is 19 feet and its length is 20 feet. To find out how much longer it is than wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, the difference between the length and width is: 20 - 19 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug with an area of 10 square feet to cover his room. Since he wants it to fit perfectly in the room, we can assume that the length of the rug is equal to half the length of the room (since the width of the rug must be less than or equal to the length). So, if the room measures 5 feet in length, then the length of the rug is also 5 feet. Now, since the area of the rug is given as 10 square feet and its length is 5 feet, we can find the width of the rug by dividing the area by the length: 10 square feet / 5 feet = 2 feet. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of 10 square feet to cover his room. Since his room is 2 feet wide, we can say that its length is equal to 10 / 2 = 5 feet. So, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.
"Response:  The room measures 4 feet in length and 20 feet in width, so it has an area of 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jesse wants to cover the entire floor with his 18 square foot rug, he needs additional rugs that are equal to the difference between the size of the room and the size of the rug. So, we need:
Additional rugs needed = Room area - Rug area
= 80 - 18
= 62 square feet
Therefore, Jesse needs 62 square feet of extra moquette to cover the remaining area of the floor."
Response:  We know that Razorback gained $23 for each T-shirt sold and during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they earned $230 selling T-shirts. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of T-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per T-shirt. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of T-shirts = $230 / $23 = 10 T-shirts. Therefore, Razorback sold 10 T-shirts during the game.
Response:  If Razorback sold 3 T-shirts and made $51 in profit, then each T-shirt must have cost at least $51 / 3 = $17 per shirt. So, the price of each T-shirt is $17.
Response:  If they sold $87 per shirt during Arkansas game and sold 47 shirts, then they made $4091 ($87 x 47) in revenue from those shirts alone. During the Texas Tech game, they sold an additional $87 x 95 = $8365 in revenue from shirts. Therefore, their total revenue for both games is $4091 + $8365 = $12456.
Response:  We know that during the Arkansas game they sold $106$ times 115 = $12350$ T-shirts and during the Texas Tech game they sold $106$ times 137 = $14980$ T-shirts. So, they sold $\boxed{12350 + 14980 = 27330}$ T-shirts in total.
Response:  If they sold $98 per T-shirt during the Arkansas game and they sold 89 T-shirts, then they made $8,722 ($98 x 89) in revenue from those T-shirts alone.
Response:  If they sold $78 per T-shirt during the Arkansas game and sold 172 T-shirts, then they made $13,404 in revenue ($78 x 172) from that game alone. During the Texas Tech game, they sold a total of 186 T-shirts, so if they sold 172 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, how many did they sell during the Texas Tech game? Therefore, they made an additional $15,920 in revenue ($78 x 186 - $13,404) from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game. 
Response:  The cost price of each t-shirt is $62 and that of each maillot is $99. So, if they sold x t-shirts and y maillots, their total revenue would be 62x + 99y. Now, we are given that during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 maillots. Therefore, their total revenue can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = 62(183) + 99(31) = $10,753. So, they gained $10,753 in selling t-shirts.
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt sold, they made $67 and for each jersey sold, they made $165. So if we multiply these amounts by the number of t-shirts and jerseys sold during the game, we get: T-shirts: $67 x 74 = $4932 Jerseys: $165 x 156 = $25,840 Total: $4932 + $25,840 = $30,772 Therefore, they made $30,772 in revenue from selling jerseys during the game.
"Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling t-shirts and jerseys is $192 + $34 = $226 per item. So if they sold 157 t-shirts at $226 each, their total revenue would be:

$157 x $226 = $38,092

If they also sold 19 jerseys at $226 each, their total revenue for jerseys would be:

$19 x $226 = $4,134

So the total revenue for both t-shirts and jerseys combined is:

$38,092 + $4,134 = $42,226

Now we can calculate the cost of one additional t-shirt over a jersey as follows:

Cost of one additional t-shirt = Total revenue - Revenue from jerseys
= $42,226 - $4,134
= $38,092

Therefore, the cost of one additional t-shirt over a jersey is $38,092."
Response:  We know that for each T-shirt sold at the store, they make $86 in profit and for each jersey sold, they make $232 in profit. So if we assume that the price of a T-shirt is x, then the price of a jersey would be 2x since it costs twice as much to produce. Now let's find out how many T-shirts were sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. According to the question, they sold 254 T-shirts. Therefore, the total revenue from selling T-shirts was 254 x $86 = $21,976. Similarly, they sold 43 jerseys, so the total revenue from selling jerseys was 43 x $232 = $9,706. Now, to find out how much more a jersey costs than a T-shirt, we need to subtract the revenue from selling T-shirts from the revenue from selling jerseys. This gives us $9,706 - $21,976 =-$12,270. So, a jersey costs $12,270 more than a T-shirt.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $51, and during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they offered an 8$ discount per shirt, selling 130 T-shirts in total. So, we can calculate their profit as follows: Profit = Number of T-shirts sold x Price of one T-shirt - Discount amount Total revenue = Number of T-shirts sold x Price of one T-shirt Total expense = Number of T-shirts sold x Cost price of one T-shirt Profit = Total revenue - Total expense In this case, let's assume that the number of T-shirts sold is 130. Now, we need to find out the price of one T-shirt (cost price) and the discount amount. Based on the information provided in the question, we know that the cost price of one T-shirt is $51, and they offered an 8$ discount per shirt. Therefore, the price of one T-shirt after the discount is given by: Price of one T-shirt = $51 - 8$ = $43 So, now we have all the values needed to calculate the profit: Total revenue = 130 T-shirts x $43 = $5270 Total expense = 130 T-shirts x $51 = $6530 Profit = $5270 - $6530 = -$1260 This means that Razorback lost $1260 by selling those T-shirts during the game.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $201. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they increased the price by $217 per T-shirt, so the selling price became $438 ($201 + $217). If they sold 14 T-shirts during this time period, their total revenue would be $6,095 ($438 x 14). So, they gained $6,095 in revenue from selling those T-shirts.
"Response:  If they sold $60 worth of T-shirts during the game and made $10 for each shirt sold, then...
$60 / $10 = 6 T-shirts sold
So, they sold 6 T-shirts during the game."
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the Razorback store sold 5 T-shirts for $215. To find out how much each T-shirt cost, we can divide the total amount of money earned by the number of T-shirts sold: $ 215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt cost $43.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is given as $215. Since they sold 20 t-shirts during the game, the revenue generated from each t-shirt can be calculated as follows: $215 / 20 = $10.75 per t-shirt. Therefore, the store gained $10.75 x 20 = $215 in revenue from selling t-shirts.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $204 (since they sold 158 t-shirts and each one costs $204). Now, we need to find out how much money was made from selling jerseys. According to the problem statement, they sold 2 jerseys during this time period. So, the total amount of money earned from selling jerseys = $76 x 2 = $152. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the store during this time period = $204 + $152 = $356.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling t-shirts and jerseys is $210 + $240 = $450. Since they sold 177 t-shirts, their revenue from t-shirts is $240 x 177 = $41,860. Similarly, since they sold 23 jerseys, their revenue from jerseys is $210 x 23 = $5,030. So, the total revenue of the store during this event was $41,860 + $5,030 = $46,890. Now we need to find out how much one t-shirt costs more than a jersey. To do this, we can divide the difference in revenue between t-shirts and jerseys by the number of t-shirts sold: ($46,890 - $5,030) / 177 = $26.67 per t-shirt. Therefore, one t-shirt costs $26.67 more than a jersey.
Response:  We know that for each maillot sold, the store makes $25 and for each t-shirt sold, they make $115. So if we want to find out how much more expensive a maillot is than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a maillot. According to the information given in the passage, the store sold 78 maillots and 113 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling maillots can be calculated as follows: Total revenue from maillots = Number of maillots x Price of a maillot = 78 x $25 = $1900. Similarly, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts x Price of a t-shirt = 113 x $115 = $13095. Now, let's calculate the difference between the total revenue from maillots and the total revenue from t-shirts: Difference = Total revenue from maillots - Total revenue from t-shirts = $1900 - $13095 =-$11195. Therefore, one maillot costs $11195 more than one t-shirt.
Response:  They have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs. So, they have 5 x 10 = 50 chairs in total. Since they have more chairs than tables, there are 50 - 5 = 45 tables. Therefore, they have 45 tables and 50 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 2 sets of tables in the garden and each set has the same number of chairs. So, if we let x be the number of chairs in one set of tables, then the other set must have x chairs too. Therefore, the total number of chairs in both sets is 2x. Since there are 12 chairs in the entire garden, we can write the equation: 2x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 6. So, there are 6 chairs in each set of tables.
Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs in the garden and each set of tables has 3 chairs. So, we can write an equation as follows: 9 = 3x, where x is the number of sets of tables. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 9 / 3 = 3. Therefore, they have 3 sets of tables in their garden.
Response:  They have decided to organize the party in their garden. If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 11 x 13 = 133 chairs. So, there are 133 chairs in their garden.
Response:  If there are 11 people sitting on the chairs and each set of tables has 6 chairs, then we can say that 5 sets of tables have 6 occupied chairs (since 11 - 6 = 5). So, 5 sets of tables have no empty chairs. Therefore, the number of empty chairs is equal to the total number of sets of tables minus the number of sets with occupied chairs, which is 10 - 5 = 5. Hence, there are 5 chairs remaining unoccupied.
Response:  They have decided to organize the party in their garden and they have 12 sets of tables with each set having 14 chairs. Additionally, there are 6 extra chairs. So, the total number of chairs for the guests is: 12 x 14 = 168 + 6 = 174 chairs. Therefore, the answer is 174 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs. So, in total, they have 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since 14 people will attend the party, we need to add 12 chairs + 2 (for the hosts) = 14 chairs. Therefore, they must buy 2 extra chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 ensembles of tables and each ensemble requires 14 chairs, then the total number of chairs required is 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. So, they have 126 chairs in addition to the 9 ensembles of tables.
Response:  If he won a total of $460 during 5 weeks of harvest, that means he earned $92 per week ($460 / 5).
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest. If he earns $16 per week, then we can find out how many weeks the harvest lasted as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
So, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks."
"Response: 
Lewis Gagne earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of harvest, which is equal to $4,532 ($21 x 216).
If he has to pay $702 in taxes, then his net income will be:
$4,532 - $702 = $3,830.
So, at the end of the season, Lewis Gagne will have $3,830 left after paying taxes."
Response:  If he earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks during one season of harvest, then in total, he will have earned $296,410 ($1357 x 223). Now, if he works for 73 seasons of harvest, his total earnings would be $296,410 x 73 = $2,083,330.
"Response: 
Lewis works for 109 weeks during the harvest season and earns $28 per week. He also works additional hours each week and earns $939 per week for those extra hours. If he works more than 40 hours per week, his total income will be higher than $939 per week. So, his total income during the harvest season is greater than $939 x 109 = $102,710."
"Response:  We know that Lewis Gagné earns $403 per week during the harvest season for 23 weeks. If he also pays $49 in rent each week, his total income for the harvest season is:
$403 x 23 = $9,190
So, Lewis Gagné earns $9,190 during the harvest season."
"Response:  We know that Lewis Gagne earns $368 per week during the harvest season of 1359 weeks. If he has to pay $388 in rent each week, then he pays how much rent during the harvest season?
To find out, we can multiply the amount he earns per week by the number of weeks he works during the harvest season:
$368/week x 1359 weeks = $472,072
So, Lewis Gagne pays $472,072 in rent during the harvest season."
"Response: 
Lewis Gagne earns $491 per week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay a rent of $216 per week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season?
We can start by calculating the total amount of money Lewis earned during the harvest season:
$491 x 1181 = $573,011
Now, let's subtract the amount of rent he had to pay each week:
$573,011 - ($216 x 1181) = $455,705
So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis Gagne will have $455,705 left after paying his rent."
Response:  We know that Lewis has collected $133 in 19 weeks of harvesting. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide this amount by the number of weeks: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. So, Lewis earns $7 per week.
Response:  We know that Lewis received $2 each week during harvest. So he earned a total of $2 x number of weeks = $2 x 178 = $356. Therefore, the duration of the harvest was equal to $356 / $2 = 178 weeks.
Response:  We know that Dean measures 9 feet (or 9 x 3 = 27 inches). The water is 10 times deeper than Dean's height, so the depth of the water is 10 x 27 = 270 inches. Therefore, the difference between the depth of the water and Dean's height is 270 - 27 = 243 inches.
Response:  We know that Dean measures 8 feet less than Ron, so Ron measures 14 + 8 = 22 feet tall. The water is twice as deep as Dean, which means it is 2 x 8 = 16 feet deep. Therefore, the depth of the water was 16 feet.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. So if Ron is x feet tall, then the depth of the water is 5x feet. Since Dean measures 11 feet less than Ron, we can say that Dean is x - 11 feet tall. Now, we are told that Dean measures 12 feet, so we can set up an equation as follows: 5x = 12 + 11. Solving for x, we get x = 72 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water was 72 feet.
Response:  We know that Dean is taller than Ron by 4 feet. So, if Ron measures 13 feet tall, then Dean must be at least 17 feet (13 + 4) tall. Now, we are told that the water is 15 times deeper than Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water would be 15 x 17 = 255 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron measures 13 feet (4.9 meters) and Dean is 9 feet (2.7 meters) more than Ron. So, Dean measures 22 feet (6.7 meters). Now, we are told that the water is 16 times deeper than Ron. Therefore, the depth of the water is equal to 16 multiplied by 13 = 198 feet (60.5 meters).
Response:  We know that Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, so Ron is 15 + 6 = 21 feet tall. The water is 9 times as deep as Dean, so it is 9 x 21 = 189 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Bryan has 34 books in total and he wants to put them on two shelves. Since each shelf can hold books equally, we can assume that each shelf will have half of the total number of books, which is 17 books (34 / 2 = 17). So, there are 17 books in each étagère.
Response:  If Bryan has a total of 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then he must have 21 shelves. Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  If he has 27 books in each of his 23 bookshelves, then he has a total of 27 x 23 = 611 books. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines in each of his 23 magazine racks, then he has a total of 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines. Therefore, the total number of books and magazines that Bryan owns is 611 + 1840 = 2451 items.
Response:  If he has 9 books in each of his 10 bookshelves, then he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines in each of his 10 magazine racks, then he has a total of 46 x 10 = 460 magazines. Therefore, the total number of magazines Bryan has is 460.
"Response:  If Bryan has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

* Number of books = 23 x 29 = 657 books
* Number of magazines = 61 x 29 = 1749 magazines

So, Bryan has a total of 657 books and 1749 magazines."
Response:  We know that Bryan has 7 étagères with the same number of books on each étagère. Therefore, he has 7 x 7 = 49 books in total. Since there are 28 books in total, we can divide the total number of books by the number of étagères to find out how many books are on each étagère: 49 books / 7 étagères = 6.7 books per étagère. So, there are approximately 6.7 books on each étagère.
"Response:  If Bryan has 38 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then we can write an equation as follows:

Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 38 / 2
= 19
Therefore, Bryan has 19 shelves."
Response:  If Carol wants to send invitations to 10 friends and each pack of invitations contains 2 invitations, then she needs... (10 friends) x (2 invitations/pack) = 20 packs of invitations. Therefore, Carol needs 20 packs of invitations to make sure that nobody is left out.
Response:  Since Carol sent out invitations to 12 friends and she bought 3 packages of invitations, there are 12 x 3 = 36 invitations in total. So each package contains 36/3 = 12 invitations.
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packs of invitations and each pack contains 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she is sending invitations to only 2 friends, we need to subtract the number of invitations sent from the total number of invitations. Therefore, the number of invitations that remain with Carol is 70 - 2 = 68 invitations.
Response:  We know that Carol bought 6 packs of invitations, each containing 14 invitations. So, in total, she has 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, so now she has 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends.
Response:  Since each pack of invitation contains 3 invitations and she has already bought 2 packs, that means she has in total 6 x 3 = 18 invitations. To invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 9 - 18 = 9 invitations. So, she needs to buy 9 more invitations.
Response:  If Melissa has scored 12 points in each of her matches and she has played x number of matches, then the total number of points she has scored is 12x. Since we know that the total number of points she has scored is equal to 36, we can set up the equation 12x = 36. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, Melissa has played 3 matches.
"Response:  If Melissa has played 3 matches and scored a total of 81 points, then she must have scored x points in each match. Since she scores the same number of points for each match, we can write an equation based on this information:
x = 81 / 3
So, Melissa scored 27 points per match (since 81 divided by 3 is equal to 27)."
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each match and obtained 82 points as bonus, then her total score for one match is: Total score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, if she played 79 matches, her total score would be: Total score = 191 x 79 = 14,599 points. Therefore, the answer is 14,599 points.
"Response:  If Melissa has marked 21 points in total and she scored 7 points in each game, then...
We can write an equation using this information:
Total points = Number of games x Points per game
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
21 = (Number of games) x 7
Now, divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for the number of games:
Number of games = 21 / 7
Therefore, Melissa played 3 games."
Response:  If Melissa has marked 91 points in 13 matches and she scored the same number of points at each match, then we can write an equation as follows: P = 91 / 13, where P is the number of points Melissa scored in each match. So, the answer is 7 points per match.
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride it at once, then each seat can accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5). So, each seat can contain 5 people.
"Response:  The question states that ""La grande roue du parc Paradise a plusieurs sièges."" This means that there are multiple seats in the Ferris wheel. Then it says each seat can accommodate 9 people. So, if 18 people can go up at once, how many seats does the big wheel have? Well, to find out, we need to divide the number of people who can go up at once (18) by the number of people each seat can hold (9). That gives us 2 seats per person or 2 x 18 = 36 seats! Therefore, the great wheel has 36 seats."
"Response:  Since each large wheel in the park has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people, we have:
Number of seats = Number of large wheels x Number of seats per large wheel
= 20 x 19
= 380 seats
Now, let's find out how many people can mount in 20 large wheels at once:
Total number of people who can mount = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat
= 380 / 15
= 25.67 people (round off to 26 people)
Therefore, 26 people can mount in 20 large wheels simultaneously."
Response:  The great wheel has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then we have 18 - 10 = 8 available seats left. So, in total, 8 x 15 = 120 people can mount the big wheel at the same time.
Response:  The great wheel has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people, so in total it can carry 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since there are currently 16 people on the big wheel, we have room for 84 - 16 = 68 additional people to join. Therefore, the answer is 68.
Response:  Since there are 2 small places and 23 large places, we can calculate as follows: Total number of people who can ride = Number of small places x Capacity per small place + Number of large places x Capacity per large place. So, total capacity = 2 x 14 + 23 x 54 = 780 people. Therefore, 780 people can mount in the big wheel on the small places.
Response:  The total number of small places = 3 x 16 = 48 people. Since each big place can accommodate 12 people, the total number of people who can go up in the big wheel = 48 / 12 = 4 people. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If 16 people can fit in the big wheel at once, and it has 4 seats, then each seat can hold how many people? To find this out, divide the total number of people who can fit in the wheel by the number of seats. In this case, we have: Total people = 16 People per seat = 16 / 4 = 4 So, each seat can hold 4 people.
Response:  If four people can ride in the big wheel at once and each seat can hold two people, then there are 4 x 2 = 8 seats in total. So, the big wheel has 8 seats.
Response:  If there are 14 parts in total and we ordered 7 pizzas, then each pizza has 14/7 = 2 parts. 
Response:  If each pizza has 2 parts and there are 28 parts in total, then we must have ordered 14 pizzas (28 / 2 = 14). Therefore, we have ordered 14 pizzas.
"Response:  If we have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of pizzas x the number of slices per pizza = Total number of slices.
17 pizzas x 4 slices/pizza = 68 slices (total)
Therefore, there are 68 slices of pizza in total."
Response:  If we have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90. Since there are 2 of us, we will get 45 slices each (90 / 2).
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 10 seeds in each flower bed. So, if there are 45 flower beds, they have planted a total of 45 x 10 = 450 seeds. Therefore, the answer is 450.
Response:  If they have put the same number of seeds in each bed, then the total number of seeds they have planted is equal to the number of beds multiplied by the number of seeds per bed. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Total Number of Seeds = Number of Beds x Number of Seeds per Bed. Now, according to the question, they have planted 45 seeds in total and there are 9 beds, so we can substitute these values into the equation as follows: Total Number of Seeds = 45 x Number of Seeds per Bed. Since they have planted one seed in each bed, we can simplify the equation as follows: Total Number of Seeds = 45 x 1 = 45. So, they have planted 45 seeds in each of the 9 beds.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. They put 12 seeds in each of the 3 parters of flowers they had. So, if we multiply 36 by 3, we get 108 seeds. However, only 58 seedlings grew into flowers, which means that there were 50 unplanted seeds (108 - 58 = 50). Therefore, they had 3 parters of flowers.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed, so they planted 55 / 15 = 37 seedlings in each flower bed. Since only 60 of them grew into flowers, we can find out how many didn't grow by subtracting the number that grew from the total number of seeds planted: 37 - 60 = -23. So, unfortunately, none of the remaining 23 seeds grew into flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers that Paige and her mom planted is 0.
Response:  If Paige and her mom planted 10 seeds in each flower bed, then they planted a total of 60 seeds (10 x 6 = 60). Since there are 60 seeds in total, there must be 6 flower beds. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Paige and her mom planted 32 seeds in total, and they divided them equally among 8 flower beds, then each flower bed would have received 4 seeds (32 / 8 = 4). So, Paige and her mom planted 4 seeds in each of the 8 flower beds.
Response:  If Matthew had x number of biscuits and gave 2 to each of his 11 friends, then he would have given a total of 2x biscuits away. So, if we subtract the number of biscuits he gave away from the original number of biscuits he had (x), we get the number of biscuits Matthew originally had: x - 2x = -0.5 or 0.5 biscuits. Therefore, Matthew had 0.5 biscuits initially.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 biscuits to give away and he gave 2 biscuits to each of his friends, then he has given a total of 8/2 = 4 friends biscuits. So, he has given biscuits to 4 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 biscuits and gave an equal number to each of his 5 friends, then he gave away 15/5 = 3 biscuits per friend. So each friend ate 3 biscuits. Since Matthew still has 10 biscuits left after giving them away, that means he has 10 - 3 = 7 biscuits left.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 biscuits and gave an equal number to his 3 friends, then he gave 8 biscuits to each friend (since 3 x 8 = 24). So, Matthew gave away 8 biscuits in total. Now, if he still has 17 biscuits left, that means he has 17 - 8 = 9 biscuits left for himself.
"Response:  If Matthew had 22 biscuits and 34 gâteaux in total, that means he gave each of his 11 friends an equal number of both biscuits and gâteaux (since they all got the same amount). So if one friend received x biscuits and y gâteaux, then the other 10 friends also received x biscuits and y gâteaux. In total, Matthew gave away 22x + 34y biscuits and gâteaux. Since each person got the same amount, we can write: 
x = 22/11 = 2
y = 34/11 = 3
Therefore, each person ate 2 biscuits and 3 gâteaux."
"Response:  If Matthew had 29 biscuits and 30 gâteaux, then he gave an equal number of both to his two friends. So, if one friend got x biscuits, the other friend got x gâteaux as well. Since Matthew gave away an equal amount of each, we can write the equation:
x + x = 29 (for biscuits)
x + x = 30 (for gâteaux)
Now, solve for x in each equation separately:
For biscuits: x + x = 29
Solve for x: x = 14
So, each friend got 14 biscuits from Matthew.
For gâteaux: x + x = 30
Solve for x: x = 15
So, each friend got 15 gâteaux from Matthew."
Response:  If Matthew had 14 biscuits and 21 gâteaux in total, that means he had 14 + 21 = 35 treats to share among his 7 friends. Since each friend got an equal number of biscuits and gâteaux, we can say that each person received (35 / 7) = 5 treats in total. So, each person ate 5 biscuits and 5 gâteaux.
Response:  If Matthew had 36 biscuits and divided them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would have received 2 biscuits (36/18 = 2).
Response:  If Matthew gave 6 biscuits to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 6 x 5 = 30 biscuits. So, if he had 36 biscuits initially, he must have had 36 - 30 = 6 biscuits left after giving them away. Therefore, he gave biscuits to 5 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 biscuits and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 23/2 = 11 biscuits to each friend. So, each friend ate 11 biscuits.
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 biscuits initially and he gave an equal number of biscuits to his 5 friends. So, the number of biscuits he gave away is equal to the number of friends he gave them to. Therefore, the number of biscuits Matthew gave away = 5 x Number of biscuits given to each friend. 
Now, we are asked how many biscuits Matthew gave to each friend. The question states that after giving an equal number of biscuits to his 5 friends, Matthew has 23 biscuits left. So, if he gave 5 friends an equal number of biscuits (let's call it x), then the total number of biscuits he gave away = 5x. 
Therefore, the value of x can be found by dividing the total number of biscuits given away by the number of friends he gave them to: x = Total number of biscuits given away / Number of friends he gave them to. 
Substituting the values given in the question, we get: x = 23 / 5 = 4.6. 
So, Matthew gave 4.6 biscuits to each of his 5 friends."
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of biscuits and gâteaux to his 4 friends, then he gave 8 (biscuits) + 8 (gâteaux) = 16 items in total. Since there are 4 friends, each friend received 16 / 4 = 4 items. Therefore, each person ate 4 biscuits or gâteaux.
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of biscuits and gâteaux to his 4 friends, then he gave 2 (biscuits) + 2 (gâteaux) = 4 gâteaux to each friend. So, each person ate 4/4 = 1 gâteau.
"Response:  If Matthew had initially 13 biscuits and 15 gâteaux, then he gave each of his 28 friends an equal number of both biscuits and gâteaux. So, if x is the number of biscuits given to each friend, y is the number of gâteaux given to each friend, and z is the total number of biscuits and gâteaux given away (i.e., 28), we can set up the following equations:
x + y = 13... (1)
x + y = 15... (2)
z = x + y + 13 + 15 = 46... (3)
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 7
y = 9
So, each friend got 7 biscuits and 9 gâteaux in total."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought water bottles when they were on sale and she drank 109 bottles per day. If the bottles lasted for 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she had purchased as follows:

Number of bottles = Daily consumption x Number of days used
= 109 bottles/day x 74 days
= 8266 bottles
Therefore, Debby had purchased 8266 water bottles."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale and she drank the same number every day. So, if it lasted for 17 days, we can write an equation as follows:
Debby drank x bottles per day.
Since there are 153 bottles in total, we can set up the following equation:
x + (x \* 17) = 153
Now let's solve for ""x"" or how many bottles did Debby drink each day?
Solving the above equation, we get:
x = 9
So, Debby drank 9 bottles of water each day!"
Response:  If Debby bought 264 bottles of water and she drinks 15 per day for 11 days, then she will have drunk a total of 1890 (15 x 11) bottles. So, if we subtract this amount from the number of bottles she initially bought, we get 264 - 1890 = -1626 bottles. Therefore, Debby has -1626 bottles left.
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 301 bottles of water and she has drunk 144 per day for several days. So, we can write an equation:

Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Number of days = 301 / 144
= 2

Therefore, Debby has been drinking water for 2 days."
"Response:  If Debby bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were on sale, then she has a total of 101 bottles (88 + 13). 
If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, it means that in one day, she will consume 4 + 87 = 91 bottles. 
So, to find out how many days the water bottles will last, we need to divide the number of water bottles by the number of bottles consumed per day: 88 / 91 = 0.96 or approximately 1 day. Therefore, the water bottles will last for approximately 1 day."
Response:  We know that Debby bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they were on sale. If she drinks 312 bottles of water per day, then she will finish all the water in 312/200 = 1.56 days. Since there are only 4 bottles of soda left after finishing the water, it will take her 4/256 = 0.015 days to finish them. Therefore, the soda will last for approximately 1.56 + 0.015 = 1.575 days.
"Response:  If Debby buys 6 bottles of water per day and she has bought a total of 12 bottles of water, then we can calculate how many days she will have them as follows:
Days = Total amount / Daily consumption
= 12 bottles / 6 bottles/day
= 2 days
Therefore, Debby will have her 12 bottles of water for 2 days."
"Response:  If Debby bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she has a total of 275 bottles (95 + 180). Since she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days her supply will last as follows:

Days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption
= 275 / 69 (15 for water + 54 for soda)
= 3.9 days
Therefore, Debby's supply of water will last for approximately 3.9 days."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale. If she drinks 122 bottles of water per day and 9 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days it will take for her to finish both types of beverages as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles of water + Number of bottles of soda
= 162 + 9
= 171

Now, let's divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles she drinks per day:

Days until soda is finished = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption rate
= 171 / 9
= 19 days

Therefore, it will take Debby approximately 19 days to finish the remaining 9 bottles of soda."
Response:  Since there are 14 rows and each row has 11 crayons, we can write this as an equation: 14 x 11 =. Now let's solve for the number of crayons: 14 x 11 = 154. So, Faye has 154 crayons.
Response:  Since Faye placed 12 crayons in total and divided them into 3 rows, each row must have 4 crayons (since 12 / 3 = 4). So, the number of crayons in each row is 4.
Response:  Since there are 28 packs of crayons and each pack has 24 crayons, we have a total number of crayons equal to 28 x 24 = 672 crayons. Now, since Faye places her crayons in rows with 16 crayons per row, she can make 672 / 16 = 43 rows of crayons. Therefore, Faye could make 43 rows or 43 stacks of crayons.
Response:  We know that Faye has 6 packs of crayons with 14 crayons in each pack. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 crayons. Since we are told that there are 22 crayons in each row, and since Faye has 6 rows, the total number of crayons is 6 x 22 = 132 crayons. So, the answer is 132 crayons.
Response:  If we have 35 crayons and 7 different colors of crayons, then each color has 35/7 = 5 crayons per color. So, if she places her crayons in rows of 5 crayons each, she can make 35/5 = 7 rows. Therefore, she could make 7 rows of crayons.  
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her crayons and colored pencils in 19 rows with 4 crayons and 27 colored pencils in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of crayons as follows: Total number of crayons = Number of rows x Number of crayons per row = 19 x 4 = 76 Crayons So, there are 76 crayons in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed her crayons and colored pencils in 7 rows with 36 crayons and 30 colored pencils in each row. So, we can write this as follows:
Row 1: 30 crayons + 30 colored pencils = 60 objects
Row 2: 30 crayons + 30 colored pencils = 60 objects
...
Row 7: 30 crayons + 30 colored pencils = 60 objects
Total number of crayons = Total number of colored pencils = 60 x 7 = 420 objects
Therefore, Faye has 420 colored pencils."
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her crayons and colored pencils in 11 rows with 31 crayons and 27 colored pencils in each row. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of crayons = Number of rows x Number of crayons per row Total number of colored pencils = Number of rows x Number of colored pencils per row Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total number of crayons = 11 x 31 = 331 Total number of colored pencils = 11 x 27 = 297 Therefore, Faye has 331 crayons and 297 colored pencils in total.
Response:  If Faye places 30 crayons in rows of 5 each, then she can make... (1)...rows of 30/5 = 6 crayons. So, Faye could make 6 rows.
Response:  If Faye has 6 crayons in total and she places them in 2 rows of equal length, then each row will have 3 crayons (since there are 6 crayons in total and 2 rows). So, Faye placed 3 crayons in each row.
Response:  Since each pack of crayons contains 4 crayons and Faye had 35 such packs, the total number of crayons she had was 35 x 4 = 140. Now, since she placed her crayons in rows with 2 crayons in each row, we can divide the total number of crayons by the number of rows she could make to get the number of rows possible. So, 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Faye could make 70 rows of crayons.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packs of crayons and each pack has 6 crayons. So, in total, she had 31 x 6 = 186 crayons. Now, we are asked how many rows of 19 crayons she placed. Therefore, the number of rows is 19. Since each row contains 19 crayons, the total number of crayons placed by Faye is 19 x 186 = 3274 crayons.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her crayons and colored pencils in 30 rows with 71 colorful pencils and 24 pencils in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total Number of Pencils = Number of Rows x Number of Pencils per Row = 30 x 24 = 720 pencils. Therefore, Faye has 720 crayons or pencils altogether.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her colored pencils and regular pencils in 16 rows with 6 colorful pencils and 21 regular pencils in each row. So, we need to find out how many colorful pencils she has altogether. To do this, let's multiply the number of rows (16) by the number of colorful pencils in each row (6): 16 x 6 = 96. Now, add the total number of regular pencils (21 x 16 = 320). Therefore, Faye has 96 + 320 = 416 colorful pencils in total.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. Since each bus can accommodate a certain number of students, we need to find out how many students each bus can hold. Let's assume that each bus can seat an average of 30 students (this is just an estimate, as it may vary depending on the size of the bus). Therefore, the total number of seats available on all 7 buses is: 7 x 30 = 210 seats. Now, let's subtract the number of students who will be attending the field trip from the total number of seats available: 210 - 98 = 112 seats remaining for other activities or trips. So, if all 7 buses are full, there would be 16 seats per bus (112 / 7 = 16).
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 buses to transport students for the field trip. Each bus can accommodate 118 students, so we need to divide the total number of students who will go on the field trip by the number of buses available. Therefore, the total number of students who will go on the field trip is:
84 classrooms x 95 buses = 8060 students (approximately)
So, there are approximately 8060 students in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, we have:
Number of students = 67 x 66 = 4232 students
Since there are 6 places in each bus, we need:
Number of buses = Number of students / Number of seats per bus = 4232 / 6 = 705 buses
Therefore, 705 buses are needed to take all the students on the field trip."
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students. Since each classroom has the same number of students, we can assume that there are 87 students in total. If there are 2 seats per bus, then we need buses to transport all the students. To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus: 87 / 2 = 43. So, 43 buses are necessary for the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has the same number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in all classrooms is equal to 24 x Number of students per classroom = 24 x 120 = 2880 students. Since there are 84 seats available on each bus, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats available on each bus to find out how many students go to school on each bus. So, the number of students who go to school on each bus is 2880 / 84 = 35 students. Therefore, there are 35 students in each classroom.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and each bus can hold 8 students. So, we need to divide the number of students who want to go on the field trip by the capacity of each bus. In this case, if 22 students do not want to go, we will need 22 / 8 = 3 buses to accommodate all the students who want to go on the field trip. Therefore, 3 buses are necessary for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. Each bus can accommodate 99 students. If 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then we have 11 - 8 = 3 students who will participate in the field trip. Therefore, 3 students will attend the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 3 students on average (as stated in the problem). So, the total number of students in the school is:

72 x 3 = 216

Since there are only 111 students in total, we can see that some classes must have fewer than 3 students. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per bus to find out how many buses are needed:

216 / 3 = 72

So, 72 buses are necessary for the trip."
Response:  We know that there are 46 buses and 92 students in the school. If all the buses are full, then each bus can carry a maximum of 92/46 = 2 students. Therefore, there are 2 seats available in each bus.
Response:  If there are 11 boys in total and each boy gets 9 balls from Haley, then the total number of balls given out is 11 x 9 = 99 balls. So, Haley had 99 balls at first.
Response:  If there are n boys in total and each boy gets 5 balls from Haley, then the number of balls given to all the boys is 5n. Since Haley has 10 balls initially, the total number of balls available for distribution is 10 + 5n = 15. So, the number of boys that Haley gave balls to is 15 / 5 = 3.
Response:  If there are 4 boys and each boy gets an equal amount of balls (since they all like playing with billes), then each boy will receive 6 balls ( since 4 x 6 = 24). So, Haley will have 15 balls left for herself. Therefore, each boy will receive 6 balls.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing with balls and 50 boys who like playing cards, then together they make up a total of 63 boys (13 + 50 = 63). Since Haley has 26 balls to distribute among them, each boy will receive an average of 63/26 = 2.42 balls. So, each boy will receive approximately 2.42 balls.
Response:  If there are two boys in total and they both like playing with balls, then each boy will receive half of the total number of balls (10). So, each boy will get 5 balls.
Response:  If each boy received 2 balls from Haley, and there are X boys in total, then the number of balls given out is 2X. Since Haley had 28 balls initially, we can set up the equation: 2X = 28. Solving for X, we get X = 14. So, Haley gave 2 balls to 14 boys.
Response:  The book had 392 pages and he read 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading pages. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Frank took 27 days to finish his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, there are approximately 12,380 pages in the book.
"Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 6 days and it had 612 pages in total. So, he read x pages per day, where x is the number of pages he read in one day. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:
x = Total pages / Number of days
In this case, x = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish the book with 555 pages in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages per chapter as follows: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to complete the book Chapter 1: Number of pages per chapter = 555 pages / 220 days = 2.5 pages/day Chapter 2: Number of pages per chapter = 555 pages / 220 days = 2.5 pages/day Chapter 3: Number of pages per chapter = 555 pages / 220 days = 2.5 pages/day Chapter 4: Number of pages per chapter = 555 pages / 220 days = 2.5 pages/day Chapter 5: Number of pages per chapter = 555 pages / 220 days = 2.5 pages/day So, there are approximately 2.5 pages per day for each chapter.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish the book with 193 pages. Therefore, we can calculate his daily reading speed as follows:
Daily Reading Speed = Total Number of Pages / Time Taken
= 193 pages / 660 days
= 0.28 pages per day
So, Frank read approximately 0.28 chapters per day."
Response:  If Frank read 3 books in total and each book had 249 pages, then he read a total of 747 pages (3 x 249). To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish reading them: 747 pages / 3 days = 249 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read some books and each book had 66 pages. So, if he reads x books, then he will have to spend time reading them which is given as t = 12 days/book. Therefore, the total time taken by Frank to read all the books can be calculated as follows: Total Time = Number of Books × Time per Book = x × 12 = 492 days Now, we are asked how many books Frank has read in total. Since it took him 492 days to finish all the books, we can conclude that he has read x books where x = 492 / 12 = 40 books. Therefore, the answer is 40 books.
Response:  We know that it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book and there are 112 pages in the book. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of days = 112 pages / x pages/day Where x is the number of pages Frank reads per day. Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank reads per day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages (112) by the number of days taken to finish the book (16): x = 112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages/day Therefore, Frank reads 7 pages of his favorite book every day.
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, then he will finish reading the book in:

Days = Number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank took 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  The book had 41 chapters with each chapter having 450 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is 41 x 450 = 17650 pages. Now, we are told that it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, which means he read at most 17650 / 30 = 585 pages per day. Therefore, the answer is 585 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 607 days. This means he read one chapter every day. Since each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Chapter 1: 594 pages / 607 days = approximately 95 pages per day
Chapter 2: 594 pages / 607 days = approximately 95 pages per day
Chapter 3: 594 pages / 607 days = approximately 95 pages per day

Therefore, there are approximately 95 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 664 days and each chapter had 405 pages. So, we can calculate the number of chapters he read per day as follows:

Total number of pages in the two chapters = 2 x 405 pages = 810 pages
Time taken to read the book = 664 days

Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the time taken to read them:

Number of chapters read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book
= 810 pages / 664 days
= 1.23 chapters/day

Therefore, Frank read approximately 1.23 chapters per day during the 664 days it took him to finish reading his favorite book."
"Response:  If we can buy 6 packs of DVD with $120, then each pack must cost:
$120 / 6 = $20 per pack
Therefore, each pack costs $20."
Response:  If each pack costs $81, then the cost of 33 packs would be: 33 x $81 = $2693.
"Response:  If each pack of DVD costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 on each pack, then we can calculate the cost of one pack as follows:
$107 - ($106 x number of packs) = Cost per pack
Now, if you want to know how many packs you can buy with $93, we need to divide the amount available ($93) by the cost per pack:
Number of packs = Available amount / Cost per pack
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Number of packs = $93 / ($107 - ($106 x number of packs))
Simplifying and solving for number of packs, we get:
Number of packs = $93 / ($107 - $106)
= $93 / $1
= 93
Therefore, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs with $93."
Response:  The cost of each pack is given as $76. If there is a reduction of $25 on each pack, then we need to find out how much the reduced price of each pack would be. So, the cost of each pack after the discount = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each pack.
"Response:  To find out how many packs of DVDs you can buy with $104, we need to divide the amount of money available ($104) by the cost of each pack ($26). So, the number of packs you can buy is:
$104 ÷ $26 = 4
Therefore, you can buy 4 packs of DVDs with $104."
Response:  If we have $28 and we want to buy 2 packs of DVDs, then each pack must cost less than $28 / 2 = $14 per pack. Therefore, each pack costs $14.
"Response:  Since there are 18 bananas in total, we can divide them into groups of size 2 as follows:

Group 1: Banana 1 and Banana 2
Group 2: Banana 3 and Banana 4
...
Group 9: Banana 16 and Banana 17
Group 10: Banana 18 (since there are no more pairs)

So, there are 10 groups of bananas in total."
"Response:  We know that there are bananas in Philip's collection because it says ""Il y a des bananes dans la collection de bananes de Philip."" So let's assume that the number of bananas in his collection is x. Then we know from the problem statement that each group of bananas has 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of groups of bananas is $x \div 187$. Since there are 140 groups mentioned in the problem, we can set up an equation as follows: $$x = 140 \times 187$$ Solving for x, we get $x = 26,950$. So, Philip has 26,950 bananas in his collection."
Response:  Since there are 203 bananas in total and they are organized into 7 groups, then each group contains an equal number of bananas (i.e., 203 / 7 = x). Similarly, since there are 63 oranges in total and they are organized into 95 groups, then each group contains an equal number of oranges (i.e., 63 / 95 = y). Therefore, we can write the equation: x + y = 203 (total number of fruits) and xy = 63 (number of oranges). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 28 and y = 4. So, each group of bananas contains 28 bananas, and each group of oranges contains 4 oranges.
"Response:  We know that there are 356 oranges in total and they are divided into groups of size x. Since there are 142 bananas, we can say that the number of orange groups is equal to the number of banana groups minus the number of orange groups. Therefore, we have:
x = 142 - (47 \* 356) / 142 = 142 - 1509 / 142 = -118
So, each group of oranges has size -118."
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Since each group contains an equal number of bananas (as stated in the problem), we can say that the size of each group is 392 / 196 = 2. So, each group contains 2 bananas.
"Response:  We know that there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection and each group of bananas has to contain at least one banana with a length of 18 cm. So we can start counting from 18 cm and count how many groups we need to make this number of bananas fit exactly. 
Let's see... if we have 180 bananas and each group contains at least one banana of length 18 cm, then we will need 180 / 18 = 10 groups of bananas. Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in total. If we divide the number of bananas into groups of 2, then each group will have 290/2 = 145 bananas. So, the size of each group of bananas is 145.
"Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges in total and 192 bananas. If we divide the number of oranges among groups of 16 each, then the number of groups is:

384 / 16 = 24
So, there are 24 groups of oranges."
Response:  If she prepared 38 cookies and each of them was divided into 19 parts, then... (1)...she had 38 x 19 = 672 pieces in total. So, she prepared cookies for 672 guests.
Response:  If Brenda's mother has prepared cookies for 14 people and each person gets 30 cookies, then... (1) x = 14 (2) x = 30 (3) x = 420. So, Brenda's mother has prepared 420 cookies in total.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made cookies for 5 people and prepared 22 cookies in total, that means she had to make 22 - 17 = 5 extra cookies for each person. So, each person got 5 cookies.
Response:  If only one guest came and there were 18 cookies in total, each guest would have received 18/1 = 18 cookies. Since 9 guests did not come, then the number of cookies that each guest received is equal to the number of guests who came (1). So, each guest received 1 cookie.
Response:  If there are 2 guests and her mother made 14 cookies, then each guest received how many? 14 / 2 = 7 cookies per guest. So, each guest had 7 cookies.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother prepared a total of 10 cookies and each guest had 2 cookies, then...

Step 1: How many guests did Brenda's mother prepare cookies for?
Number of cookies = Total number of cookies / Number of guests who received cookies
= 10 cookies / 2 cookies per guest
= 5 guests

Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 5 guests."
Response:  If Frank had 42 bonbons and he divided them equally among two bags, then each bag would have 42/2 = 21 bonbons.
"Response:  If Frank had x bonbons and he divided them into 26 bags with 33 bonbons each, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = 26 × 33
Now solve for x:
x = 840
So, Frank had 840 bonbons in total."
Response:  We know that Frank had initially 33 bonbons and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 bonbons left. Since each bag can hold 9 bonbons, we need to divide the number of remaining bonbons by 9 to find out how many bags he will have: 9 / 9 = 1. Therefore, Frank will have 1 bag of bonbons.
Response:  If Frank has 22 bonbons and he wants to put 11 in each bag, then... (1) He will need bags to store all his bonbons. So, we can write: 22 = 11x + x where x is the number of bags needed. (2) Now, we solve for x by subtracting 11 from both sides of equation (1): x = 11(22 - 11) = 11(11) = 12. Therefore, Frank needs 12 bags to store all his bonbons.
Response:  If Frank has 16 candies in total and he put some of them in two bags, then there must be an equal number of candies in each bag. So, if we divide 16 by 2, we get 8. Therefore, there are 8 candies in each bag.
Response:  If Shirley has sold 25 boxes of Trefoils and each box contains 14 pieces, then she must deliver 350 pieces (25 x 14 = 350).
"Response:  If Shirley has sold 10 boxes of Trefoils and she needs to deliver 5 cases, then each case must contain how many boxes? To find this out, we can divide the total number of boxes (10) by the number of cases (5):

10 / 5 = 2
So there are 2 boxes in each case."
"Response:  The total number of bouteilles of soda is given as 76 (67 + 9). So if they had more than 9 bouteilles of soda dietetic, that means they had less than 76 - 9 = 67 bouteilles of regular soda. Therefore, they had 67 - x bouteilles of regular soda where x is the number of bouteilles of soda dietetic they had. 
So, we can write an equation: 67 - x = 9. Solving for x gives us x = 58. Therefore, they had 58 bouteilles of regular soda more than the dietetic soda."
Response:  The number of bouteilles of soda ordinary is 22 and the number of bouteilles of soda dietetic is 61. So we have to find out how many more bouteilles of soda dietetic they had than soda ordinary. To do this, we subtract the number of bouteilles of soda ordinary from the number of bouteilles of soda dietetic: 61 - 22 = 39. Therefore, they had 39 more bouteilles of soda dietetic than soda ordinary.
Response:  The store had 30 regular sodas and 8 dietetic sodas, so in total they have 30 + 8 = 38 bottles of soda. Additionally, there were 41 apples. So, the total number of bottles is 38 (sodas) + 41 (apples) = 79 bottles.
Response:  The total number of bouteilles of soda is 79 + 53 = 132 bouteilles. So, they had 132 - 42 = 90 bouteilles of ordinary soda more than dietetic soda. Therefore, the answer is 90.
"Response:  The number of bouteilles of soda dietetic is 54 and the number of bouteilles of ordinary soda is 83. So we have:
Ordinary soda - Dietetic soda = Number of bouteilles of ordinary soda minus number of bouteilles of dietetic soda
= 83 - 54 = 29
So they had 29 more bottles of ordinary soda than dietetic soda."
Response:  We know that there are 17 bouteilles in total and 9 of them are regular sodas. So, the number of diet sodas is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, they had 8 bouteilles of diet soda.
"Response:  The number of bouteilles de soda diététique is 19 and the number of bouteilles de soda ordinaire is 60. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of bouteilles de soda ordinaire = Number of bouteilles de soda diététique + X
Where X represents the difference between the number of bouteilles de soda ordinaire and the number of bouteilles de soda diététique.
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

60 = 19 + X
Now, to solve for X, we need to subtract 19 from both sides of the equation:

41 = X
Therefore, there are 41 bouteilles de soda ordinaire more than the number of bouteilles de soda diététique."
Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of regular and diet sodas and apples. So we have: Total = Number of Regular Sodas + Number of Diet Sodas + Number of Apples. Now let's substitute the values given in the question: Total = 72 + 32 + 78 = 182. Therefore, they had 182 more bottles than apples. 
"Response:  The number of apples is 36 and the number of bottles of regular soda is 80. So, we have:
Apples = 36
Regular soda = 80 - 36 = 44
Now, let's find out how many more bottles of soda they had than apples:
More bottles of soda = 44 - 36 = 8
So, there were 8 more bottles of soda than apples."
Response:  We know that there are 30 bouteilles in total and 28 of them are regular sodas. So, the number of diet sodas is 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, they had 2 bouteilles of diet soda.
"Response:  If they had 4 bouts of dietary soda and 79 more bottles of regular soda than dietetic soda, then we can write an equation as follows:
Number of Dietetic Soda = 4
Total Number of Bottles of Soda = Number of Dietetic Soda + (79 - 4) = 4 + 75 = 89
Therefore, there were 89 bottles of regular soda in total."
Response:  The store had 57 regular sodas and 26 dietetic sodas, so together they have 83 bouteilles (57 + 26). Then, we add the light sodas to that number, which is 27 more bouteilles, for a total of 110 bouteilles (83 + 27). Therefore, the store had 110 bouteilles of soda in total.
Response:  The total number of bouteilles of soda is given as follows: 81 + 60 + 60 = 201 bouteilles. Since we know that there are more ordinary sodas than dietetic ones, let's subtract the number of dietetic sodas from the total number of sodas: 201 - 60 = 141 bouteilles. Therefore, the number of ordinary sodas is 141.
"Response:  The store had 49 regular sodas and 40 dietetic sodas in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Regular sodas = 49
Dietetic sodas = 40 - 49 = -13
Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Dietetic sodas
= 49 + (-13)
= 62
Therefore, the store had 62 bottles of soda in total (including both regular and dietetic)."
Response:  If there were 295 visitors to the palace yesterday and then 317 visitors today, that means an increase of 22 visitors (317 - 295 = 22). So, there are 22 more visitors at the palace today than there were yesterday.
"Response:  If there were 246 visitors yesterday and they visited the palace of Buckingham for 25 days, then we can calculate how many visitors went to the palace in total as follows:
Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Total number of days
= 246 visitors/day x 25 days
= 6,150 visitors (to the palace)
Therefore, the answer is 6,150 visitors."
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to the palace yesterday and then 666 more visitors today, that means there are now 1666 visitors at the palace (100 + 666 = 1666). So, compared to the previous day, there are 666 more visitors at the palace today.
"Response:  If 406 people visited the palace in the last 327 days and 132 visitors came today, then the number of visitors per day is:

Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 406 / 327
= 1.25
So, approximately 125 visitors visited the palace yesterday."
"Response:  We know that 829 people visited the palace during the last 85 days and 45 people visited it the day before. So, we can write an equation:
Number of visitors = Total number of visitors in 85 days + Number of visitors the previous day
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Number of visitors = 829 + 45
Number of visitors = 874
Therefore, 874 people visited the palace on that day."
Response:  If there were 557 visitors to the palace yesterday and 71 paintings in the palace, then the number of visitors per painting is 557 / 71 = 7.6. Now, if there had been 188 visitors the day before, then the total number of visitors over 57 days would be (188 + x) where x is the number of days between yesterday and today. So, we can set up an equation as follows: 188 + (x - 57) = 557. Solving for x, we get x = 394. Therefore, there were 394 people who visited the palace in 57 days. 
Response:  If there were 600 visitors to the palace the day before and 39 paintings in the palace, then the number of visitors per painting is 600 / 39 = 15.47 visitors per painting. Now, if there were 661 visitors to the palace today, then the number of visitors per painting is (661 - 600) / 39 = 20.83 visitors per painting. So, there are 20 more visitors per painting today than yesterday.
"Response:  If there were 419 visitors yesterday and 103 visitors the day before that, then the total number of visitors in the two days preceding today is:
419 + 103 = 522
So, the total number of people who visited the palace before today is 522."
Response:  If there were 471 visitors yesterday and 808 visitors the day before that, then in total, there are 471 + 808 = 1280 visitors during those two days. And if they visited the palace again today, then the total number of visitors over the last 3 days is 1280 + 512 = 1792 visitors. So, the answer is 1792.
Response:  If there were 191 visitors yesterday and 457 visitors the day before that, then together they visited the palace for 648 days (191 + 457 = 648). Now, if 705 people visited the palace today, then the total number of visitors in the last 3 days is 705 + 648 = 1353. So, there are 1353 - 245 = 1108 more visitors today than on the previous 245 days combined.
"Response:  We know that he needs additional 159 grams of wax to stick the feathers together. So, let's find out how much wax is already available. According to the problem statement, if the feathers require 628 grams of wax in total, then the amount of wax already available is:

628 - 159 = 469 grams

Therefore, the amount of wax he has already is 469 grams."
Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of colors to paint them and we also know that each plume requires 288 grams of wax. So if he has already used 260 grams of wax, then how much does he have left? To find out, divide the amount of wax needed for one plume (288 grams) by the number of plumes he wants to paint (49 grams). This gives us 5.7 grams per plume. Since he has already used 260 grams of wax, he has 260 - 5.7 = 254.3 grams of wax left.
Response:  We know that he needs 57g of colors and 22g of glue to stick them together. So far, we have used 59g (57 + 22) of materials. If each feather requires 353g of glue, then how much glue has he already used? Therefore, the answer is 353 - 59 = 294g.
"Response:  We know that he needs to glue 166 grams of feathers together and he has currently 20 grams of wax. So we need to find out how much more wax is needed:

166 g - 20 g = 146 g

Therefore, he needs an additional 146 grams of wax."
"Response:  We know that he needs to glue 17 grams of feathers together and he has 557 grams of wax left. So we can calculate it as follows:
Gramage of wax needed = Total amount of wax - Amount of wax already used
= 557g - 17g
= 540g
Therefore, the plumes require approximately 540 grams of wax to be glued together."
"Response:  We know that he needs to glue all his feathers together and each feather requires 492 grams of wax. So we need to find out how many feathers he has. 
We are told that he will be added to the list soon, so let's assume he currently has 11 feathers. Therefore, he needs (492 g / 11 g) = 4470 grams more of wax to glue all his feathers together."
"Response:  We know that there are 94 grape pickers who fill 90 ton of grapes in 6 days. So, we can calculate how many tons of grapes each picker fills per day as follows:
Tons of grapes filled/Number of pickers = Tons of grapes filled/Days
= 90/6 = 15 tons of grapes per day
Therefore, 15 tons of grapes would be filled by each picker per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 266 cueilleurs (grape pickers) who fill 90 tonneaux of grapes in 5 days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of grape pickers × Number of days = Total number of tonneaus filled with grapes

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:

266 cueilleurs × 5 days = 1330 tonneaus

So, each day, 1330 tonneaus of grapes would be filled by the 266 grape pickers."
Response:  We know that there are 294 pickers who fill 244 tonneaus of grapes per day and 47 tonneaus of strawberries per day. To find out how many tonneaus of grapes will be filled in 146 days, we can multiply the number of pickers by the amount they fill per day: 294 x 244 = 70,560 tonneaus of grapes. Since there are also strawberries being picked, we need to subtract the amount of strawberries from the total amount of grapes: 70,560 - 47 = 66,573 tonneaus of grapes. Therefore, in 146 days, approximately 66,573 tonneaus of grapes would be filled.
"Response:  We know that there are 235 pickers who fill 100 barrels of raspberries per day and 221 barrels of grapes per day. To find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled in 77 days, we can multiply the number of pickers by the number of barrels they fill per day: 
(235 pickers) x (100 barrels/day) = 23,500 barrels of raspberries 
(221 pickers) x (221 barrels/day) = 49,621 barrels of grapes 
Therefore, in 77 days, 49,621 barrels of grapes would be filled."
Response:  We know that Étienne likes to check his grapes after 57 stops. This means he has checked them 57 times in total. Now, we are told that 252 grape pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day. So, if Étienne checks the grapes every day for 58 days, how many drums of grapes will be filled? To find out, we can multiply the number of days by the number of drum...
"Response:  Since he is checking in last, it means that there are already 35 days passed since the start of harvesting. So, if 36 pickers can fill 8 tonneaus per day, then they have filled 35 x 8 = 280 tonneaus so far. To find out how many more days it will take to fill another 240 tonneaus, we need to divide the remaining amount (240 - 280) by the daily production rate (8):

Days required = (240 - 280) / 8 = -17 days

So, it will take approximately 17 days for him to check all the vines and fill 240 tonneaus of grapes."
"Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has the same number of animals. So, if we divide the total number of marine animals (52) by the number of aquariums (26), we get the average number of animals in each aquarium:

$$ \boxed{\frac{52}{26} = 2 } $$

Therefore, each aquarium has 2 marine animals."
Response:  We know that there were 40 animals of saltwater in total and each aquarium contained 2 animals. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of aquariums = Number of animals / Number of animals per aquarium. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
"Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 39 animals. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of marine animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium
= 56 x 39
= 2244

Therefore, Tyler has 2244 marine animals in his collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 aquariums for animals of saltwater and each aquarium contains 46 animals. Therefore, we can write:
Number of animals of saltwater = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium
= 22 x 46
= 952 animals of saltwater
So, Tyler has 952 animals of saltwater."
Response:  For the marine animals, he had 15 aquariums and each aquarium contains 19 animals, so he has 15 x 19 = 285 marine animals. Similarly, for the freshwater animals, he had 62 aquariums and each aquarium contains 19 animals, so he has 62 x 19 = 1174 freshwater animals in total. Therefore, the answer is 285 + 1174 = 1459 animals.
Response:  If we divide 39 by 13, we get 3 packets of T-shirts. So Maman will have 3 packets of white T-shirts.
Response:  Maman achete 66 t-shirts blancs and each pack contains 3 t-shirts whites. So we can write it as follows: 66 = 3x where x is the number of packets. Therefore, there will be 22 packets (66 / 3).
Response:  If Mom buys 28 packages of white T-shirts and each package contains 56 shirts in total, then we can calculate how many shirts are in each package as follows: Number of shirts per package = Total number of shirts / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2. Therefore, each package contains 2 white T-shirts.
Response:  Maman has bought 57 packages of white T-shirts, and each package contains 53 T-shirts. Therefore, she has purchased a total of 57 x 53 = 3093 white T-shirts.
Response:  If Maman buys 51 white T-shirts and each can be bought in packs of 3, then we need to find out how many groups of 3 she will buy. So, we divide 51 by 3 = 17. Therefore, Maman will buy 17 packets of 3 T-shirts each.
Response:  We know that Maman bought 70 white T-shirts in total and she buys them in packets of 14 each. So, we can write an equation as follows: 70 = 14x where x is the number of T-shirts in each packet. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 14: x = 70/14. Therefore, there are 5 T-shirts in each packet (70 / 14 = 5).
Response:  If there are 4 bags with an equal number of cookies and a total of 36 cookies, then each bag must contain 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  We have 33 total cookies and each bag contains 11 cookies. To find out how many bags we have, we can divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag: 33 / 11 = 3 bags. So, we have 3 bags of cookies.
"Response:  If each bag contains 41 cookies and you have 53 bags of cookies, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many cookies are in one bag.
Number of cookies per bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags
= 41 cookies / 53 bags
= 0.78 (or approximately 80 cookies)

So, there are approximately 80 cookies in each bag.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies you have:
Total number of cookies = Number of bags x Number of cookies per bag
= 53 bags x 0.78 (approximately 80 cookies/bag)
= 42.4 (or approximately 43 cookies)

Therefore, you have approximately 43 cookies in total."
Response:  If we have 14 cookies in total and there are 7 bags containing an equal number of cookies, then each bag contains 14/7 = 2 cookies. Therefore, each bag contains 2 cookies.
"Response:  If each bag contains 3 cookies and you have a total of 21 cookies, then...

Step 1: How many bags can you make with 21 cookies?
To find this out, divide the number of cookies (21) by the number of cookies in each bag (3):
21 cookies / 3 cookies per bag = 7 bags
So, you can make 7 bags of cookies."
"Response:  We know that we have 26 bags with an equal number of cookies in each bag. So, if we divide the total number of cookies (52) by the number of bags (26), we get the average number of cookies per bag: 52 / 26 = 2.
Therefore, we have 2 bags of cookies."
Response:  We know that we have 28 biscuits and 86 bonbons in total. If each bag of biscuits contains an equal number of biscuits (as stated in the problem), then there must be 8 bags of biscuits with 3 biscuits per bag. Therefore, we have 8 x 3 = 24 bags of biscuits. So, we have 24 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If there are x houses in each block and he has to distribute 5 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of unwanted mail is 5x. Since he distributed 25 pieces of mail to each block, the total number of blocks is 25/5 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 houses in each block and 5 blocks in total. So, the total number of houses is 5 x 5 = 25 houses.
Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each block and we need to distribute 9 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, we will have to distribute a total of 180 pieces of unwanted mail (20 x 9 = 180). So, the factor must distribute 9 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 20 houses in each block.
Response:  Since there are 6 houses in total, and each house gets an equal share of undesirable mail (i.e., no house gets more than any other), we can assume that each house will receive $\frac{24}{6} = 4$ pieces of undesirable mail. Therefore, the factore must give $4$ pieces of undesirable mail to each house.  
"Response:  If there are x houses in each patio and the factor distributes 14 unwanted ads to each house, then he will distribute 14x ads to all the houses in one patio. 
If he has to distribute 2 additional ads for each patio, then he will distribute 2(14x) = 28 ads to all the houses in one patio. 
So, there are 28 houses in each patio."
"Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each paté of houses, and the facturer must distribute 32 pieces of undesirable mail to each house in each paté of houses, we can write an equation as follows:
Total number of pieces of undesirable mail = Number of patés of houses x Number of houses per paté x Number of pieces of undesirable mail per house
= 20 x 32 x 1 = 640 pieces of undesirable mail
So, the facturer must give 640 pieces of undesirable mail to each paté of houses."
"Response:  Since there are 78 houses in total and each house gets an equal amount of unwanted mail (30 pieces), we can start by dividing 78 by 3 to find out how many pieces of mail each house will get:

78 / 3 = 26

So each house will receive 26 pieces of unwanted mail."
"Response:  If there are 55 blocks in total and each block has 8 pieces of undesired mail to distribute, then the total number of pieces of undesired mail is 55 x 8 = 440.
If the factor distributed 32 pieces of mail to each house in a block, then the number of houses in one block is 440 / 32 = 14."
Response:  Since there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses, we need to distribute 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in each block. Therefore, the number of pieces of unwanted mail that must be distributed in each block is 4 x 12 = 48. So, the answer is 48.
"Response:  Since there are 17 houses in each block and we need to distribute 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, the total number of pieces of unwanted mail that must be distributed is:

17 x 4 = 68

So, the factor must distribute 68 pieces of unwanted mail in total."
"Response:  We need to divide the total number of objects (billes + œufs) into groups of size 4. Since we have 20 billes and 10 œufs, the total number of objects is 30. To find out how many groups can be created, we divide 30 by 4:
Group formation = 30 / 4 = 7
So, Rebecca will create 7 groups of 4 balls each."
"Response:  We have to divide 15 eggs into groups of 5. To do this, we need to find out how many times 15 can be divided by 5. 
We know that 15 / 5 = 3. So, we will create 3 groups of 5 eggs each. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide an egg collection into groups of 11 eggs each, and each group has 2 eggs, then she will have... (11 x 2 =) 22 eggs in total!
Response:  We have 8 oeufs and 6 balls. If we want to divide them into 4 groups of equal size, each group will contain how many eggs? Divide 8 by 4 to find out... (answer: 2) So, each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into 3 groups. If she has 4 marbles and 15 eggs, then each group will have an equal number of eggs. Therefore, we can write the equation: 15 / 3 = x, where x is the number of eggs in each group. Solving for x, we get x = 5. So, each group will have 5 eggs.
"Response:  We need to divide the total number of objects (18 œufs + 72 bananes + 66 billes) into groups of 6. So we will have:
Group size = Total number of objects / 6 = 18/6 = 3 groups
So, 3 groups will be created."
Response:  We have to divide the total number of objects (99 + 9 + 27) into groups of 3. So we will create 33 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of 5. So, she will have 5 groups of eggs. Now, we need to find out how many eggs are in each group. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that there are 20 eggs and 6 marbles. Since there are 6 marbles, it means that 3 marbles are left over after dividing the eggs into groups of 5. Therefore, each group of 5 eggs contains 4 eggs (20 / 5 = 4) and one marble is left over. So, Rebecca has 4 + 1 = 5 more eggs than marbles.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of 20. Since she has 12 eggs and 5 marbles, we can start by grouping the eggs in pairs (since each egg is paired with another egg). So, the first group will have 6 eggs (half of the total number of eggs), and the second group will also have 6 eggs. Now, let's count how many eggs are left after forming these two groups:

Eggs remaining = Total eggs - Number of eggs in first group - Number of eggs in second group
= 12 - 6 - 6
= 4

So, Rebecca has 4 eggs left over after grouping them into groups of 20. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and gained 11 points each round, he played how many rounds? To solve this problem, we can use the equation: Total score = Number of rounds x Gain per round. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 154 points / 11 points per round = 14 rounds. So, Luke played 14 rounds.
"Response:  If Luke played 177 turns and won $46 at each turn, he would have earned a total of:
$46 x 177 = $8,202
So, Luke has scored a total of $8,202 in the game."
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points in total after playing two matches of trivia, and he obtained the same number of points at each match, then we can write an equation based on this information: Total score = Score per match x Number of matches. In this case, the total score is 84, so if we divide it by the number of matches (which is 2), we get the score per match: Score per match = Total score / Number of matches = 84 / 2 = 42 points per match. Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per match.
"Response:  If Luke won 146 points in each turn of the game and he played 157 turns, then...

146 x 157 = 21,392 points

So, Luke scored 21,392 points in the game."
Response:  If Luke obtained 3 points for each correct answer and played $n$ rounds, then his total score after $n$ rounds is given by $\text{Total Score} = 3 \times n$. Therefore, to find out how many rounds Luke played, we can set up an equation using the information provided in the problem statement: $\text{Total Score} = 78$, which simplifies to $n = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{3}$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 26$. So, Luke played $26$ rounds of the game.
Response:  If Emily had 2 perls and she was able to make 32 collars, then each collar needed an average of 16 perls (32 / 2 = 16).
"Response:  If Emily made 11 collars and each collar requires 28 perls, then she must have had x perls in total to make all those collars. Since there are 11 collars, we can write an equation as follows: 
x = 11 × 28 = 308 perls. Therefore, Emily had 308 perls in total."
Response:  If Emily makes one collar at a time and each collar requires 8 perls, then she can make 8 colliers with the 16 perls she has. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  Since Emily has made 18 colliers and she had 6 perles left after making them all, each collar needed an average of 3 perles (18 / 6 = 3).
Response:  If Emily makes n collars and each collar takes 5 beads, then she has used a total of 5n beads. Since there are 4 collars in total, we can write: 5n = 4 × 5 = 20. Solving for n, we get n = 20 / 5 = 4. So, Emily had 4 x 5 = 20 beads in total.
Response:  Since Emily has 6 perls and each collar requires 3 perls, she can make 6/3 = 2 colliers. So, Emily can make 2 colliers.
Response:  If Emily has 5 perls and she can make 20 collars, then each collar needs 4 perls (since 20 / 5 = 4).
Response:  If Emily made 26 collars and each collar takes 2 beads, then she used 52 beads (2 x 26). So, Emily had 52 beads.
Response:  The total number of children in the county is given as 819058 + 668278 = 1487336. So, if 819058 children went to camp, then the number of children who stayed at home is 1487336 - 819058 = 668278. Therefore, there are 668278 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp.
"Response:  The total number of children in the county is given as 314,353. Of these, 202,958 went to summer camp and 77,762 stayed at home. So, the difference between the number of children who stayed at home and those who went to camp is:

202,958 - 77,762 = 125,296

Therefore, there are 125,296 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp."
Response:  The total number of children in the county is 898051. During summer break, 629424 children go to camp. So, the number of children who stay at home = Total - Number going to camp = 898051 - 629424 = 268627. Therefore, 268627 children remain at home during summer break.
Response:  We know that there are 313 473 children in the county of Lawrence. During summer holidays, 274 865 children stay at home and the remaining go to camp. So, the number of children who go to camp is equal to the total number of children minus those who stay at home. Therefore, the answer is: 313 473 - 274 865 = 38 608.
"Response:  We are given that during summer holidays, 907611 children in the county of Lawrence stay at home and the other 455682 children go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children there are in total in the county of Lawrence. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who stay at home with the ratio of those who go to camp. The ratio is given as ""the others"". Therefore, we have: Total number of children = Number of children who stay at home x Ratio of children who go to camp / Number of children who stay at home Total number of children = 907611 x (455682 / 907611) Total number of children = 455682 Children in the county of Lawrence stay at home."
Response:  We know that during summer holidays, 800059 children from the county of Lawrence go to camp and the others stay at home. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children in the county - Number of children who went to camp. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of children in the county = 828521 Children who went to camp = 800059 Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home = 828521 - 800059 = 487662 So, there are approximately 487662 children who remained at home during the summer holidays.
Response:  We know that during summer holidays, 61619 children of the county of Lawrence stayed at home and the others went to camp. The total number of children in the county of Lawrence is 91676. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, approximately 30057 children from the county of Lawrence went to camp.
"Response:  The number of children who went to summer camp = Total number of children in the county - Number of children who stayed at home. 
= 34044 - 134867
= -100433
Therefore, the number of children who attended the summer camp is -100433."
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children in the county, 590796 stayed at home during summer break. So, we have 20003 (610769 - 590796) children who did not stay at home. Now, among these 20003 children, 22 are from outside the county, so their number is 20003 x 22 = 44006. Therefore, there are 44006 children in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that 644997 children stayed at home and 893835 children went to summer camp. So, in total, there are 1538232 children in the county of Lawrence (644997 + 893835). Then we have additional 78 children from outside the county who attended the camp, so the final number of children in the county is 1539000.
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie, so if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 3 = 9 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 9 - (x + 3) = 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 pommes and Jackie has 2 pommes. To find out how many more pommes Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of pommes Jackie has from the number of pommes Adam has. So, the difference between Adam's pommes and Jackie's pommes is: 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, Adam has 8 more pommes than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 pommes and Jackie has 10 pommes. So, we can say that Jackie has 1 more pomme than Adam. Therefore, the difference between their number of pommes is equal to 1. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 pommes and Adam has 8 pommes. To find out how many more pommes Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of pommes Adam has from the number of pommes Jackie has: 10 - 8 = 2. So, Jackie has 2 pommes more than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 6 apples. If we add 4 more apples to them, it means they now have 10 apples in total (Adam + Jackie) = 6 + 4 = 10. So, the number of apples Adam has is 10 - 6 = 4.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 pommes between them. So, if we add 9 to this amount, we get:  7 + 9 = 16 pommes. Therefore, Adam has 16 - 7 = 9 pommes.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 12 apples. So, Adam has 9 more apples than what he and Jackie have together. That means Adam has 3 + 9 = 12 apples. Now we are told that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Therefore, Jackie has 4 apples (Adam has 12 - 8 = 4).
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie and together they have 2 apples left. So, Adam must have had 4 + 2 = 6 apples initially. Therefore, Adam had 6 - 6 = 0 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie and Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples in total. So, if we subtract 11 from Jackie's total number of fruits (oranges + apples), we get: 89 - 11 = 78. Therefore, Adam has 5 + 78 = 83 apples.
"Response:  We know that Hélène has made 31 cookies yesterday, 270 cookies this morning and 419 cookies before yesterday. So, we can write an equation:

Total cookies = Yesterday + This Morning + Before Yesterday
= 31 + 270 + 419
= 620

Therefore, Hélène has made 620 cookies until yesterday evening."
Response:  Yesterday, Hélène made 90 cookies with chocolate pepitas. Today, she made 51 cookies with chocolate pepitas and 484 cookies with chocolate pepitas. So, in total, Hélène has made 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 cookies with chocolate pepitas.
Response:  Yesterday, Hélène made 527 cookies with chocolate pepitas and today she made 86 cookies with chocolate pepitas. So, in total, Hélène has made 527 + 86 = 613 cookies with chocolate pepitas.
Response:  Yesterday, Hélène made 144 cookies with chocolate pepitas and 397 cookies with raisins. Today, she made 85 cookies with raisins and 403 cookies with chocolate pepitas. So, in total, Hélène has made 144 + 397 = 541 cookies with raisins. Therefore, Hélène has made 85 - 541 = -456 cookies with raisins.
Response:  According to the question, Hélène has made 19 cookies with pepites of chocolate yesterday and 237 cookies with pepites of chocolate today. So in total, she has made 237 + 19 = 256 cookies with pepites of chocolate. Therefore, the number of cookies with pepites of chocolate that Hélène has made more than cookies with raisins is 256 - 231 = 25.
Response:  Yesterday, Hélène made 197 cookies with chocolate pepitas and today she made 75 cookies with chocolate pepitas. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 122 cookies (197 - 75). Therefore, Hélène has made 122 more cookies with chocolate pepitas than she did yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, Hélène made 280 cookies with raisins and 359 cookies with chocolate chips. So, in total, she made 639 cookies (280 + 359). Now, today, she has made 300 more cookies with raisins and 519 more cookies with chocolate chips. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Hélène made yesterday and today is:  639 - (300 + 519) = 470 cookies. 
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 81 = x + y (where x is the number of games her friends have). Now, we are asked to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends. Therefore, we need to subtract x from 81: 81 - x = y. Solving for x, we get x = 22. So, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie had 91 games and her new friends had 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we are asked how many games her old friends had. According to the question, her old friends had 53 games. Therefore, the total number of games her friends had is 179 (Katie and new friends) + 53 (old friends) = 232 games.
Response:  Katie had 78 new games and her friends had 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  Katie had 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19 = 103). Her friends had 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69 = 77). Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77 = 180).
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games. Now let's find out how many new games they have. According to the question, Katie has 62 new games, and her friends have 73 new games. Therefore, in total, Katie has 62 + 73 = 135 new games. To find out how many old games they have altogether, we add the number of old games they each have: 121 (Katie) + 121 (friends) = 242 old games. 
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 63 - 57 = x, where x is the number of games that Katie has more than her friends. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 57 from both sides of the equation: 63 - 57 = x → 63 = 60 + x → x = 6. Therefore, Katie has 6 games more than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie had 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now we are told that her friends have 34 new games. So, the number of games Katie has is equal to the number of games her friends have minus the number of new games her friends have. Therefore, the answer is 96 - 34 = 62.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $60 and Jason had $19. So together they had $89. Then, Jason did some washing and now he has $33 more than last week, which is equal to $52 ($33 + $19). Therefore, Jason gained $52 by washing cars over the weekend.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $86 and Jason had $5, so together they had $91. Since then, Fred has earned $9 more, so he now has $90. And since Jason didn't work, he still has $5. Therefore, the total amount of money they have together is $90 + $5 = $95.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. They worked together washing cars over the weekend and now Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So, Fred gained $21 ($40 - $19) during the weekend.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. So together they had $136. Then they washed cars over the weekend and now Fred has $21 and Jason has $78. Therefore, Jason gained $57 during the weekend ($78 - $22).
Response:  Last week, Fred had $111 and Jason had $40. So together they had $151. Then, Fred did some laundry over the weekend and made $4, so now he has $115. Meanwhile, Jason delivered newspapers and earned $6, so now he has $44. In total, they have gained $15 + $6 = $21 more than last week. Therefore, the answer is $21.
"Response: 
Fred had $49 last week and earned $73 during the weekend (by washing cars). So now he has $112.
Jason had $3 last week and earned $50 delivering newspapers ($63 - $3 = $50).
Therefore, the total amount of money they gained from delivering newspapers is $50 + $50 = $100."
"Response: 
Fred had $78 last week and earned $21 from washing cars over the weekend, so he now has $99 ($78 + $21).
Jason had $31 last week and earned $14 from delivering newspapers, so he now has $45 ($31 + $14).
So, the total amount of money they gained from delivering newspapers is: $99 (Fred) + $45 (Jason) = $144."
Response:  Last week, Fred had $33 and Jason had $95. So together they had $128. During the weekend, Fred delivered newspapers and earned $16 + $74 = $90 more. Therefore, Fred earned a total of $128 + $90 = $218 during the weekend.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $47 and Jason had $99, so together they had $146. During the weekend, Fred delivered newspapers and earned $111, then he washed cars and earned $34, bringing his total earnings to $145 + $34 = $179. So now Fred has $179.
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 71 kg initially and after starting to do jogging every day, she lost 20 kg. So, her new weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie currently weighs 27 kg and has lost 101 kg after starting to run every day. So, her original weight was 101 - 27 = 74 kg. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 74 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. After running for some time, she lost weight and now weighs 66 kg. So, the difference in her weight before and after running is 126 - 66 = 60 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed 126 kg before starting to run.
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running for some time, she lost 35 kg. So, her current weight is:
69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg
Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg."
"Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 114 kg initially and lost weight at a rate of 50 kg in the first week and 60 kg in the second week. So, after two weeks, her new weight would be:

New weight = Initial weight - (Lost weight in 1st week + Lost weight in 2nd week)
= 114 kg - (50 kg + 60 kg)
= 94 kg

Therefore, Jessie now weighs 94 kg."
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 9 kg initially and lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week. So, her weight after one week of jogging is: 9 kg + (62 kg / 7 days) = 9 kg + 8.71 kg/day x 7 days = 9 kg + 59.97 kg = 68.97 kg After two weeks of jogging, her weight is: 9 kg + (140 kg / 14 days) = 9 kg + 10 kg/day x 14 days = 9 kg + 140 kg = 149 kg Therefore, before starting to do jogging, Jessie weighed 149 kg.
"Response:  We know that after one week of jogging, Jessie lost 56 kg. So, her weight after one week is:
Weight = Initial weight - Loss in first week
= 92 kg - 56 kg
= 36 kg
Therefore, Jessie weighed 36 kg after the first week of jogging."
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the enclosure. If 64 of them (all snakes) hid themselves, then we have to subtract this number from the initial total. So, the remaining number of snakes = Initial number of snakes - Number of snakes that hidden = 95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, 31 snakes did not hide themselves.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 97 alligators in the cage. If 40 of them hid themselves, then we have:
$$ 97 - 40 = 57 $$
So, 57 alligators did not hide themselves."
Response:  We know that in total there are 75 alligators and 82 serpents. If we add these two numbers together, we get 157 animals. So if 82 serpents and 19 alligators are hiding, then the number of alligators not hiding is:  157 - 82 = 75. Therefore, 75 alligators do not hide.
"Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the cage and we also know that 24 of them are serpents. So, the number of remaining animals (i.e., non-serpents) is:

Total - Number of Serpents = Total Animals - 24
= 79 - 24
= 55

Therefore, 55 animals do not hide themselves."
"Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden initially. Then he picked 134 yesterday and 30 today, so the total number of tomatoes he has left is:

Initially = 171 - 134 + 30 = 97

Therefore, after picking tomatoes today, the farmer will have 97 tomatoes left in his garden."
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden initially. Then he picked 56 yesterday, so he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden after yesterday's harvest. Today, he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left in his garden. Therefore, after yesterday's harvest, the farmer has 145 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden initially. Then he picked 154 yesterday and 50 today, so the total number of tomatoes he has picked is: 90 + 154 + 50 = 394. Therefore, the farmer has picked a total of 394 tomatoes.
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes, then he has (175 - 172) = 3 tomatoes left in his garden. Similarly, if he picked 172 potatoes, then he has (77 - 172) = -99 potatoes left in his garden. So, the farmer has 3 tomatoes and -99 potatoes left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 53 tomatoes, then he has (177 - 53) = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he had 12 potatoes and picked none, then he still has 12 potatoes. So, the farmer now has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden.
"Response:  The farmer had initially 105 green and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 137 tomatoes, then we know that the total number of tomatoes he has now is equal to the initial amount minus the ones he picked. So, let's write an equation based on this information:

Total tomatoes = Initial green tomatoes + Initial red tomatoes - Number picked
= 105 + 71 - 137
= 248

Therefore, there are 248 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden after picking 137 tomatoes."
Response:  If John needs to use 4 clouts for fixing the walls of the house and each large plank of wood requires 2 screws to be fixed, then we can calculate as follows: Number of planks = Total number of screws / Number of screws per plank Therefore, the number of planks needed = 4 (total number of screws) / 2 (number of screws per plank) = 2 planks So, John needs 2 large planks of wood to cover one wall of the house.
Response:  The total number of planches needed for the wall is 13. Each large planche needs 17 clous to be fixed and each small planche needs 8 clous. So, we need to calculate the total number of clous required as follows: Total number of clous = Number of large planches x Clous per large planche + Number of small planches x Clous per small planche Total number of clous = 13 x 17 + 5 x 8 Total number of clous = 201 + 40 = 241 Therefore, John has 241 clous to fix the wall.
Response:  If each planche needs 3 clous to be fixed and 8 additional clous have been used, then we can say that for every planche, 3 + 8 = 11 clous were used in total. So if John has used all 11 clous for fixing the walls of the house, he must have needed 11/3 = 3 planches for the wall. Therefore, John needs 3 planches for the wall of the house.
Response:  The total number of large planks is 12 and each requires 15 clouts to be fixed together. Therefore, the total number of clouts required for fixing all large planks is 12 x 15 = 180 clouts. Similarly, the total number of small planks is 10 and each requires 5 clouts to be fixed together. Therefore, the total number of clouts required for fixing all small planks is 10 x 5 = 50 clouts. So in total, John needs 180 + 50 = 230 clouts to fix the walls of the house.
Response:  Since each planche needs 2 clous to be fixed, we need 2 x 16 = 32 clous for all the planches. So, John has 32 clous needed for the wall of the house.
Response:  If we assume that each wall of the house needs 8 large wooden boards (planches), then the total number of boards needed for one wall is 8. Since each board requires 74 nails to be fixed, the total number of nails required for one wall is 74 x 8 = 592 nails. Therefore, John will need 592 nails to build one wall of the house.
Response:  We know that for each large plate, John needs 14 screws and for each small plate, he needs 25 screws. So if we multiply these numbers together, we get: Large plates x Small plates = 12 x 17 = 194 screws needed to build the wall of the house. Therefore, John will need 194 screws in total to build the wall of the house.
Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of gum in each pack and a total of 42 pieces of gum. So, if we divide the number of pieces of gum (42) by the number of pieces per pack (3), we get the number of packs: 42 / 3 = 14 packs. Therefore, Robin has 14 packs of chewing gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 paquets of chewing gum and each pack contains 23 pieces. So, in total, Robin has 43 x 23 = 990 pieces of chewing gum. Additionally, we are told that Robin has 8 extra pieces of chewing gum. Therefore, the final number of pieces of chewing gum that Robin has is 990 + 8 = 1000 pieces.
Response:  We know that Robin has 7 pieces of gum in each pack and he has 6 additional pieces of gum. So, if we multiply the number of pieces per pack (7) with the number of packs Robin has (total number of pieces / number of pieces per pack), we get: Total number of pieces = Number of packs x Number of pieces per pack = 41 x 7 = 287. Therefore, Robin has 3 packs of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pieces of gum = Total number of packages x Number of pieces per package. In this case, it would be: Number of pieces of gum = 28 x 4 = 112 pieces. Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of chewing gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packs of chewing gum and each pack contains 9 pieces. So, he has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of chewing gum. Now, we are asked how many pieces of candy Robin has. Since each pack of candy contains 45 pieces, Robin has 45 x 1 = 45 pieces of candy. Therefore, the final answer is 189 + 45 = 234 pieces of candy.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packs of gum and 14 packs of candy. Each pack contains 6 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of pieces of gum = 28 x 6 = 168
Number of pieces of candy = 14 x 6 = 84

Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces."
Response:  The machine can produce 3 shirts per minute, so it has produced 6 shirts in total. To find out how many minutes the machine worked, we need to divide the number of shirts produced by the number of shirts produced per minute: 6 / 3 = 2 minutes. So, the machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes. So in those 5 minutes, it could have produced 5 x 4 = 20 chemises (since each can produce 4 chemises per minute). Therefore, the total number of chemises produced by the machine is 20.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 9 chemises, so it worked for x minutes where x is the total time taken to produce those 9 chemises. Today, the machine produced 44 chemises, so it worked for (44 - 9) = 35 minutes. Therefore, the total number of minutes the machine worked yesterday and today is 35 + x = 44 minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 10 minutes. So, the machine worked for 10 minutes yesterday. 
Response:  The machine produced 13 chemises yesterday and 3 today. So in total, it has produced 13 + 3 = 16 chemises. Since it can produce 8 chemises per minute, the time taken to produce these chemises is 16 / 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes in total.
Response:  The machine produced 9 chemises yesterday and 8 chemises today. So in total, it has produced 17 chemises (9 + 8). Since it can produce 2 chemises per minute, the time taken to produce these chemises is 17/2 = 8.5 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 8.5 minutes today.
Response:  The machine can produce 3 shirts per minute, so it worked for 3 minutes to make 1 shirt. Therefore, it worked for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes yesterday and today combined. So, the total number of minutes the machine has worked is 8 + 180 = 188 minutes.
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts per minute, so in 12 minutes it will have produced 72 shirts (6 x 12 = 72). And today, if it has produced 14 shirts, then the total number of shirts that the machine has produced is 86 (72 + 14 = 86).
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts per minute, so in 5 minutes it will have produced 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). Today, it has produced 12 additional shirts, so the total number of shirts produced today is 42 (30 + 12 = 42). Therefore, the answer is 42.
Response:  The game has been running for 5 days and they have won $165 in total. So, if we divide this amount by 5, we get the daily winnings of $33 per day. Therefore, the answer is $33.
"Response:  The game earned $144 per day, and they were at the fairground for 22 days. So, to find out how much money they earned in total, we can multiply the amount of money earned per day by the number of days they spent at the fairground:
$144 x 22 = $3,068
Therefore, the family earned $3,068 during their time at the fairground."
"Response:  The game of ring toss at the carnival has reported the same amount of money every day. In total, over 30 days, they have won $420. With other games, they have won an additional $22. So, how much did the ring toss game win per day? 
Step 1: Write down the information given in the problem.
Amount won from ring toss = $420
Other games = $22
Total amount won = $420 + $22 = $442

Step 2: Divide the total amount won by the number of days (30).
$442 / 30 = $14.70

Therefore, the game of ring toss won $14.70 per day."
"Response:  The game earned $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. So, the total amount of money earned is:
$382 + $374 = $756
Therefore, they have gained a total of $756 at the fair."
Response:  The game earned $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days. To find out how much it earned per day during the first 20 days, we can divide the total amount earned ($120) by the number of days (20): $120 / 20 = $6 per day.
"Response:  The game earned $325 during the first 154 days and $114 during the remaining 57 days. To find out how much it earned per day during those last 57 days, we can divide the total amount earned ($114) by the number of days left (57):
$114 / 57 = $2
So, the game earned $2 per day during the last 57 days of the fair."
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packs of biscuits and 4 packs of cake. So, we have:

Biscuits = 10 packs x 5 biscuits/pack = 50 biscuits
Cake = 4 packs x 6 slices/pack = 24 slices

Now, we need to find out how many packs of biscuits Lucy bought more than she bought of cake. To do this, we can subtract the number of packs of cake from the number of packs of biscuits:

Number of packs of biscuits - Number of packs of cake = 50 - 24 = 26

So, Lucy bought 26 packs of biscuits more than she bought of cake."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 4 packs of cookies, which means she got 4 x 8 = 32 biscuits. She also bought 22 packets of cakes and 16 packets of chocolate. So in total, Lucy bought 32 + 22 + 16 = 70 packets of groceries. Therefore, the answer is 70.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of cake. So she had a total of 27 packages of groceries. Since we don't know how many packages of cake she bought, let's assume it is x. Therefore, the number of packages of cake she bought is equal to x. 
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packets of cakes. So she has purchased a total of 2 + 12 = 14 packages of food. Since at the end, she had 56 units of money left, we can deduce that each package cost her $56 / 14 = $3.86. Therefore, Lucy bought 14 packets of groceries in total.  
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can't have more than 36 people, we know that the total number of people in all the buses cannot exceed 36 x (the number of stops) = 36 x n, where n is the number of stops made by the bus. So, since there were 12 stops in total, the total number of people in the bus must be 36 x 12 = 432. Therefore, there are currently 432 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus and 3 people got off. So, now there are... (8 + 12) - 3 = 23 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got on board, so the total number of people now is: 4 + 13 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 people currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got on board, so now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train. Therefore, there are currently 19 people in the train.
Response:  If there were 22 parents in the program and each parent had an average of 4 children (as mentioned in the passage), then we can calculate the number of children as follows: Number of children = Total number of people / Average number of children per family ∝ 676 / 4 = 169 children Therefore, there were 169 children present in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents in the program and 724 students. So, we have to add these two numbers together to get the total number of people present in the program. Therefore, the answer is: 73 + 724 = 897.
Response:  If there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students also, then the total number of people involved was 174 + 521 = 695. So, the difference between the number of parents and students is 695 - 174 = 521. Therefore, there were 521 additional students present compared to the parents in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students also participated. The program could accommodate 44 people at most. So, we need to find out how many people are present beyond the capacity of the program. To do this, we subtract the number of people who can fit into the program from the total number of participants: 61 (parents) + 177 (students) - 44 (capacity of the program) = 280. Therefore, there were 280 people present in the program.
Response:  We know that they have to travel 1307 feet from the entrance of the cave to reach the end. Since we are given that the depth of the cave is 919 feet, we can calculate the distance traveled so far as follows: Distance = Depth x Number of steps taken So, in this case, the distance traveled so far would be: Distance = 919 x 1307 = 1156,330 feet Now, since they still have to go another 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave, the total distance they will have to travel is: Total distance = Initial distance + Remaining distance = 1156,330 + 1307 = 1287,640 feet Therefore, the distance until they reach the end of the cave is approximately 1287,640 feet.
Response:  The depth of the cave is given as $1218$ feet and they are already at $849$ feet. If they move at a speed of $17$ feet per minute, in how much time will they reach the end of the cave? We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance to be covered is the remaining length of the cave, which we can calculate as follows: Distance = Depth - Current Position = $1218$ - $849$ = $369$ feet. Now, we need to divide the distance by the speed: Time = Distance / Speed = $369$ / $17$ = $21.5$ minutes. So, it will take them approximately $21.5$ minutes to reach the end of the cave if they continue moving at a speed of $17$ feet per minute.
Response:  We know that they are already at 659 feet and the depth of the cave is 762 feet. So, to find out how far they have left to go until reaching the end of the cave, we can subtract the current height from the total depth: Distance = Total Depth - Current Height = 762 - 659 = 133 feet. Therefore, they are 133 feet away from the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 fish (Paige had raised them). Then, some stray cats came and started eating the fish in the pond. Since it is mentioned that only 6 fish are left now, we can conclude that a total of 2 fish have disappeared (i.e., been eaten by the cats). So, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 red fish and 12 catfish in the pond initially. If the stray cats have eaten many of them, then we can assume that some number x of the initial total has disappeared. So, the number of red fish left is 7 - x, and the number of catfish left is 12 - x. Since there are now 15 fish left in total, we can set up the equation: 7 - x + 12 - x = 15. Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x = 10. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 3. Therefore, 3 red fish and 9 catfish have disappeared.
"Response:  We know that Paige had initially 16 red fish and 71 catfish in the pond. If the stray cats have eaten much of them, then we can assume that not all of the initial number of catfish were eaten. So let's say that x is the number of catfish that were left untouched by the cats (i.e., those that are still alive). Since there are only two catfish left now, we can set up the equation:

x + 16 = 71

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:

x = 71 - 16

x = 55

So, out of the initial 71 catfish, 55 were left untouched by the stray cats. Therefore, 16 catfish were eaten by the cats."
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 red fish in the pond and that 5 of them were eaten by stray cats. So, we have to find out how many fish are left after the cats ate some. To do this, we can divide the number of fish Paige had (15) by the number of fish that were eaten (5). This gives us the number of fish remaining: 15 / 5 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 red fish left in the pond.
Response:  The chef had initially 43 apples and used some of them to make tarts. After making tarts, he had 2 remaining apples. So, we can write an equation as follows: 43 - x = 2 where x is the number of apples used for making tarts. Now, solve for x using subtraction. x = 41 Therefore, the chef used 41 apples to make tarts.
Response:  The chef had initially 58 apples and made some tarts using 35 of them. So, how many apples are left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of apples used in making tarts from the total number of apples the chef had at first: 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 apples remaining.
"Response:  The chef had initially 40 apples and 54 peaches. If he made some tarts using these fruits, then after making those tarts, there were 39 fruits left. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Apples + Peaches = Total fruits used for tarts
= 40 + 54 = 94
Now, let's solve for the number of apples used in the tarts:
Number of Apples used = Total fruits used - Number of Peaches used
= 94 - 54
= 40
Therefore, the chef used 40 apples to make the tarts."
Response:  We know that Adam can put 11 figurines of action on each shelf of his room. So, if he has 4 shelves, then he can have 4 x 11 = 44 figurines of action on those shelves. However, we are also told that his room has 40 closets. Since each closet can hold only one figure, and there are 40 closets in total, it means that Adam cannot place all 44 figures on his shelves. Therefore, the total number of figurines of action that Adam's shelves could contain is 44 - 40 = 4.
Response:  We know that Adam can put 10 figurines of action on each shelf in his room. So, if he has n shelves, then he can have a total of 10n figurines of action. Since we are told that his room can hold 8 figurines of action, it means that n must be less than or equal to 8. Therefore, the number of shelves in Adam's room is between 1 and 8 inclusive.
Response:  Since Adam can range 8 action figures and 10 cabinets per shelf, he has 8 x 4 = 32 action figures and 10 x 4 = 40 cabinets in total that his four shelves could hold. Therefore, his shelves could contain a total of 32 + 40 = 72 objects.
Response:  There are 10 gardens with 544 pots in each garden. So, there are 544 x 10 = 5440 pots in all the gardens together. Each pot contains 32 flowers, so the total number of flowers is 5440 x 32 = 176,800 flowers. Therefore, there are 176,800 flowers in total.
Response:  There are 466 pots and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 batonets. So, in total there are 466 x 53 = 24,098 flowers and 466 x 181 = 87,666 batonets. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 24,098 and the total number of batonets is 87,666.
Response:  There are 141 pots in total. Each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 sticks. So, the total number of flowers is 71 x 141 = 9571 flowers. Therefore, there are 9571 flowers in total.
"Response:  If each pot contains 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total, then...

1. Each pot can hold up to 40 flowers (since that's how many are in each pot).
2. There are 400 flowers in total (as stated in the problem).
3. Therefore, if we divide the number of flowers by the number of pots, we get...

Number of flowers per pot = Total number of flowers / Number of pots
= 400 / 40
= 10

So, there are 10 pots in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 gummies. If we organize them into groups of equal size, each group will have to contain an integer number of Skittles and gummies. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

Number of Skittles + Number of Gummies = Total number of candies in each group

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

4502 + 4276 = x (where x is the total number of candies in each group)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9778

Therefore, each group contains 9778 candies, which is the solution to the problem."
Response:  Since there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 gummies, we can say that each group of gummies contains an equal number of gummies as there are Skittles in total. Therefore, if we divide 4950 by 3941, we get the size of each group = 12. So, each group of gummies contains 12 gummies.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 517 gummies and 90 balances. If we divide the number of Skittles by 8, we get 112 (Skittles per group). So, each group contains 112 Skittles.
"Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we have:
Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class
= 270 / 5
= 54 classes
Therefore, there are 54 classes in total."
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in the school and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class. In this case, we have: Number of students = 304 x 75 = 22,800 students. Therefore, there were 22,800 students at the school.
