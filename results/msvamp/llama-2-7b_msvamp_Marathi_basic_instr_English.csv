"Response: 15
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total volume of water in the tank as follows:
Volume of water in the tank = 5 bolts + 3 bolts = 8 bolts
Now, we need to find out how much more water is required to fill up the park.
Park requires 15 bolts of water to be filled completely.
Therefore, the difference between the total volume of water in the tank and the amount of water required to fill the park is:
Difference = Total volume of water in the tank - Amount of water required to fill the park = 8 bolts - 15 bolts = -7 bolts
So, there are -7 bolts less than the required amount of water in the tank to fill the park completely."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
The first ball weighs 5 kg, and each subsequent ball weighs twice as much as the previous one. Therefore, the weight of the third ball is 10 kg (2 x 5 kg), and the weight of the fourth ball is 20 kg (2 x 10 kg). The total weight of all four balls together is therefore 5 + 10 + 20 = 45 kg. Since there are three balls in the parking lot, the average weight per ball is 45 / 3 = 15 kg."

Explanation: According to the question, Jack took three fugs of alcohol and then had four bolts of vomit. If each bolt of vomit weighs 10 grams, then Jack would have consumed 40 grams (3 x 3 = 9) + 40 grams (4 x 10 = 40) = 80 grams of alcohol."
Response: 75% (or 3/4) of the total number of balls in the park are white.
Response: 30 balls can fit in one box and 20 balls can fit in another box. Therefore, 5 boxes of size 30 balls each = 150 balls and 5 boxes of size 20 balls each = 100 balls can be carried. So, the total number of balls that can be carried is 150 + 100 = 250 balls.

From the given information, we can calculate the total number of balls in each park as follows:
Park A has 20 balls and Park B has 30 balls, so the total number of balls in both parks is:
20 + 30 = 50 balls
Now, if 6 balls are taken from Park A, the remaining balls in Park A will be:
20 - 6 = 14 balls
Similarly, if 3 balls are taken from Park B, the remaining balls in Park B will be:
30 - 3 = 27 balls
So, there are 18 balls left in both parks after taking 6 balls from Park A and 3 balls from Park B."

"Response: 320
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the number of muli in each shalete as follows:
Number of muli in each shalete = Total number of muli / Number of shaletes
= 632 / 41
= 15.2 (approximately)
Now, let's find out how many muli are there in each shalete:
Number of muli in each shalete x Number of shaletes
= 15.2 x 41
= 628
So, there are 628 muli in each shalete.
To find out the total number of muli in all the shaletes, we multiply the number of muli in each shalete by the number of shaletes:
Total number of muli = Number of muli in each shalete x Number of shaletes
= 628 x 41
= 25,792
Therefore, there are 25,792 muli in all the shaletes."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total amount of milk in liters as follows:
Meri keka bana vat ahe = 6 + 8 + 7 = 21 kp (liters)
Kriti madhye = 5 kp (liters)
So, the total amount of milk is:
21 - 5 = 16 liters
Now, let's find out how many cups of milk are there:
1 liter = 4 cups
So, the number of cups of milk is:
16 / 4 = 4 cups
Therefore, there are 4 cups of milk."
Response: 12 + 13 = 25. So, there are 25 cups of water in total.
"Response: 12
Explanation: From the given information, we can calculate that there are 9 cups of water and 6 cups of milk in Meri's kitchen. Additionally, 4 cups of water have been added to the mixture. Therefore, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is 9 + 6 = 15 cups. Since 1 cup of milk is equal to 8 oz, the total volume of the mixture in oz is 15 x 8 = 120 oz."
"Response: 10
Explanation: From the given information, we can calculate that there are 6 cups of water and 9 cups of milk in total. Since there is an excess of water over milk, we have to subtract 2 cups of water from the total amount of milk to get the correct answer. Therefore, the number of extra cups of milk required to make up for the deficit is 7 (i.e., 9 - 2 = 7)."
Response: 150 liters. Explanation: From the given information, we can calculate that there are 5 kup (capacity) of water in the container and 14 kup of milk. Since 1 kup of milk is equal to 1/2 liter, then the total capacity of the container is 5 x 2 = 10 liters. Therefore, the remaining space in the container after adding 11 kup of water is 10 - 11 = -1 liter, which is impossible. So, the correct answer is 150 liters.
Response: 150 liters. Explanation: According to the question, there are 3 cups of water and 10 cups of milk in Meri's kitchen. If we assume that one cup of milk is equivalent to 200 ml (milliliters), then the total volume of liquid in Meri's kitchen would be: 3 x 200 = 600 ml + 10 x 200 = 2000 ml = 2 liters. Therefore, if Meri wants to add some more water to her kitchen so that it has as much water as milk, she will need to add 150 liters of water (since 2 liters - 3 cups = 150 liters).
"Response: 18
Explanation: According to the question, there are 5 cups of milk and 13 cups of water. If we subtract the amount of water from the total amount of liquid, we get 5 + 13 - 12 = 18 cups of liquid remaining. Therefore, there are 18 cups of liquid left after consuming 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of water."
Response: 140 liters. Explanation: According to the question, there are 6 kgs of rice and 14 kg of wheat. To find out how many liters of water is required for cooking these grains, we need to use the following formula: Water requirement = (Weight of grain in kg x 10) / (Conversion factor x 100) Where conversion factor is 10% for rice and 12% for wheat. So, for rice, weight in kg x 10 / 10% = 60 liters And for wheat, weight in kg x 10 / 12% = 120 liters Therefore, total water required for cooking both grains is 60 + 120 = 180 liters.

So, the answer is 25 cups of water."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the given information, there are 9 cups of water and 7 cups of milk in the mixture. If we take out 2 cups of milk, then there will be 5 cups of milk left (7 - 2 = 5).

"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, there are 22 bus stops in total and each stop has 40 meters of road length. Therefore, the total length of all bus stops is 22 x 40 = 880 meters. However, since some bus stops have more than one stop line, we need to subtract the number of stops with only one stop line from the total number of stops to get the actual length of roads that can be used by buses. There are 16 bus stops with only one stop line, so the actual length of roads that can be used by buses is 880 - 16 = 864 meters."

From the given information, we can observe that there are 23 buses in total and each bus has 50 seats. Therefore, the total number of seats available in all buses is 23 x 50 = 1150 seats.
Now, let's find out how many seats are left after 24 buses have been added to the existing fleet of 23 buses.
If each bus has 50 seats, then adding 24 buses will provide an additional 24 x 50 = 1200 seats.
So, the total number of seats available after adding 24 buses is 1150 + 1200 = 2350 seats.
Finally, if 8 more buses are added to the existing fleet, the total number of seats available will be 2350 + 8 x 50 = 2430 seats."

Response: 10
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The number of trees that can be planted in an area of ​​1 hectare (10,000 square meters) is calculated as follows:

* The area of ​​the plot is 1 hectare = 10,000 square meters.
* To calculate the number of trees per square meter, we will use the formula: Number of trees / Area of ​​the plot = Number of trees per square meter.
* In this case, if we want to plant 5 melons per tree and there are 12 trees left after planting, then the number of trees that can be planted in one hectare is:
Number of trees per square meter = 5 / 10,000 = 0.005 trees/square meter.
* Now, to find out how many trees can be planted in one hectare, we multiply the number of trees per square meter by the area of ​​the plot:
Number of trees in one hectare = 0.005 trees/square meter x 10,000 square meters = 50 trees.
Therefore, the answer is 30 trees."

From the above information, we can conclude that if last year, there were 79 more bats sold than this year, and one Ekka Kirana dukana sold 4 bats, then this year, the total number of bats sold by all Ekka Kirana dukanas would be -
Total number of bats sold = Last year's total number of bats sold + This year's total number of bats sold
= 79 + x
where x is the number of bats sold by all Ekka Kirana dukanas this year.

Response: 71 kg.
Response: 27 - (101 / 2) = 14.5 kg
"Response: 170
Explanation: According to the question, Jessie's current weight is 126 kg and he wants to lose 15 kg. To calculate the number of calories he needs to consume daily for weight loss, we can use the following formula: Daily Caloric Needs = BMR x Activity Level x Desired Weight Loss (in kg) Where BMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate, which is approximately 1396 calories per day for an average adult male like Jessie. So, his daily caloric needs for weight loss would be: Daily Caloric Needs = 1396 x 1.5 (for moderately active individual) x 0.15 (desired weight loss in kg) = 170 calories per day Therefore, Jessie should aim to consume 170 fewer calories than his daily caloric needs to achieve a weight loss of 15 kg over time."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of nails required for each lakh square feet of roofing as follows:
Number of nails per sq ft = 13 (as given in the question)
Total area of the roof = 13 x 100000 = 1300000 sq ft (since there are 100000 sq ft in one lakh sq ft)
Number of nails required = Total area of the roof x Number of nails per sq ft = 1300000 x 13 = 1690000 nails
Since John wants to use 8 nails per sq ft, he will require:
Number of nails required = Total area of the roof x Number of nails per sq ft = 1300000 x 8 = 1040000 nails
