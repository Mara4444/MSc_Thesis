Explanation:
The question asks about the number of Ferris wheels that can fit in a paradise with a diameter of 20 kilometers. To calculate this, we need to divide the diameter of the paradise by the diameter of a single Ferris wheel.

A standard Ferris wheel has a diameter of around 60 meters (200 feet). Let's assume that we want to pack as many Ferris wheels as possible into the paradise without overlapping them. In that case, we would want to divide the diameter of the paradise by the diameter of each Ferris wheel.

So, if the diameter of the paradise is 20 kilometers (km), then we can fit approximately 18 Ferris wheels inside it (20 km / 60 m = 18)."
