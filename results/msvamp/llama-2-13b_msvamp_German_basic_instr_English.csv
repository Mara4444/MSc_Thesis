Question:  If Sally spent $15 on 5 toys and Emily spent $20 on 7 toys, how much did each girl spend per toy?  Based on this information, write an equation that represents the situation.  Answer:  To find out how much each girl spent per toy, we need to divide the total amount they spent by the number of toys they bought. Let's do this for both girls:

For Sally: Total amount spent = $15 Number of toys bought = 5 So, her spending per toy is: $15 / 5 = $3 per toy

For Emily: Total amount spent = $20 Number of toys bought = 7 So, her spending per toy is: $20 / 7 = $3 per toy

Equation: Spending per toy = Total amount spent / Number of toys bought

Therefore, both girls spent $3 per toy."
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balloons, then Jake brought  3 - 2 = 1 balloon with him to the park.
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons more than Allan, and Allan brought x balloons, then Jake brought 6 + x = 10 balloons.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 more than Allan, then Jake brought 5 + 6 = 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Allan had 3 + 2 = 5 air balloons and Jake had 5 air balloons, so together they had 5 + 5 = 10 air balloons in the park.
Response:  Allan had more than Jake by 3 air balloons because he bought three additional ones in the park and already brought two with him, so his total is 2 + 3 = 5, while Jake only brought four with him.
Response:  Jake had more balloons than Allan by 6 - 3 = 3 more balloons.
Response: 8 (5 + 3)
Response:  Allan had more than Jake by 6 - 2 = 4 air balloons.

"Response:  There were 1 more sack of cans collected on Monday than on the next day.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?  Based on the information provided, formulate an equation to solve for the price of the ball.  Answer:  Let B be the cost of the ball. Then, we know that the total cost of the bat and the ball is $1.10, so we can write the equation:

B + B = 1.10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2B = 1.10

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that:

B = 0.55

So, the ball costs $0.55."

"Response:  There are 2 baskets with pears. Each basket has 4 red pears and 3 green pears. If there are altogether 7 pears in all baskets, how many baskets with pears are there? 
Answer:  2"
Response:  There are 2 baskets with pears. Each basket has 4 red pears and some green pears. If there are altogether 12 pears in all baskets, then each basket has 4 + x (where x is the number of green pears) pears. Since there are 2 baskets, we can set up the equation:  4 + x + x = 12. Simplifying the equation, we get:  2x + 4 = 12. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:  2x = 8. Dividing by 2 gives us:  x = 4. Therefore, each basket has 4 red pears and 4 green pears.
Response:  There are 13 red apples and some green apples in the basket, so there must be at least 3 green apples in the basket (since all of the red ones have been counted).
Response:  There are 15 x 23 = 345 rote Pfirsiche and 15 x 4 = 60 grÃ¼ne Pfirsiche, so there are in total 345 + 60 = 405 Pfirsiche in the baskets.
Response:  There are 10 pfirsichs and each basket has 4 red and 6 green. To find out how many baskets with pfirsichs there are, we can divide 10 by 4 (the number of red) to get 2, then add 6 (the number of green) to that result to get 8. So there are 8 baskets with pfirsichs.
Response:  There are more green pears (6) than red pears (2).

Response: 4 birds have come to sit on the fence in addition to the original 2 birds.
Response: 3 birds were sitting on the fence at first.
Response:  There are 4 + 6 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence initially. If 5 more birds come, then there will be 3 + 5 = 8 birds in total sitting on the fence. Since we know that 2 storks were already there, so now there will be 8 - 2 = 6 birds of different species sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 + 2 = 5 birds more than storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence. If 3 more birds come, then there will be 2 + 3 = 5 birds in total. So, there are 6 - 5 = 1 more stork than bird on the fence.
Response:  There are 2 + 6 = 8 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence initially. If 6 more storks come, then there will be 3 + 6 = 9 storks in total. So, the final number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 3 (birds) + 9 (storks).
Response:  There are 6 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence, so there are 6 + 3 = 9 living beings in total. Two more storks came to join them, bringing the total number of storks to 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, there are 9 - 5 = 4 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 storks and 4 birds sitting on the fence. If 6 more storks come, there will be 3 + 6 = 9 storks in total. Therefore, there are 9 storks sitting on the fence, which is more than the 4 birds.
Response: 10 birds are sitting on the fence now.
Response:  There are 2 birds sitting on the fence initially and 5 more birds came to join them. Therefore, there will be 2 + 5 = 7 birds sitting on the fence in total. However, only 4 storks came to join the birds, so there will be 7 - 4 = 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are more storks (6) than birds (3 + 2 = 5) sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 5 storks and 3 birds sitting on the fence, so there are 5 + 3 = 8 birds in total. If 4 more birds came to join them, then there would be 8 + 4 = 12 birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 12 - 5 = 7 more birds sitting on the fence than storks.
Response:  There are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence, so there are 6 + 2 = 8 animals sitting on the fence in total. If three more birds come, then there will be 8 + 3 = 11 animals sitting on the fence altogether. Therefore, there are 11 - 6 = 5 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are more storks (6) than birds (2) sitting on the fence.

"Response:  There were 62 campers who went rowing in the morning and 39 campers who went rowing in the afternoon. To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning. Let's do that:

62 - 39 =?

Answer:  23. Therefore, 23 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  There were 9 more campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.
"Response: 16  
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:  
* In the morning, 15 campers went rowing.  
* Some additional campers went rowing in the afternoon.  
Total number of campers who went rowing = 15 + x (where x is the number of additional campers) Since there were altogether 32 campers who went rowing, we can set up the equation as follows:  
15 + x = 32 To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:  
x = 32 - 15 x = 17 Therefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon."
"Response:  Let x be the number of campers who went rowing in the morning. Then we know that 7x campers went rowing in the afternoon. In total, there were 60 campers who went rowing that day. So we can set up the equation:  

3x + 7x = 60 

Simplifying the equation:  

10x = 60 

Dividing both sides by 10:  

x = 6 

So, 6 campers went rowing in the morning."
Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing is 36 + 13 + 49 = 98.
"Response:  There were more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.  
Explanation: To determine this, we need to compare the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and those who did so in the afternoon. We can do this by subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

Morning: 44 campers went rowing
Afternoon: 39 campers went rowing
Total: 44 + 39 = 83 campers went rowing

Subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning gives us:

83 - 39 = 44 campers more went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  There were more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the evening.  
Explanation:  To determine this, we need to compare the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and evening. We can do this by subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the evening from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

Morning: 53 campers went rowing
Evening: 48 campers went rowing + 49 campers went rowing (as per the given information) = 48 + 49 = 97 campers went rowing in the evening

Subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the evening from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning:

53 - 97 = -44

Therefore, there were 44 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the evening."
Response: 24 (34 - 10 = 24)
Response: 84 camper went rowing in total (13 + 21).
Response: 13 (29 - 66 + 26 = 13)
Response:  There were 41 + 26 = 67 campers who went either rowing or hiking.

Response:  Rachel has picked 2 apples.
"Response: 2 unripe apples are left on the tree.  
Explanation: If Rachel picked 7 ripe apples and there are now 5 apples left on the tree, then 2 apples must be unripe (since 7 - 5 = 2)."
"Response:  The tree had 2 reipe apples at the beginning.  

Question:  If it takes 3 apples to make a pie and Rachel has 6 ripe apples, how many pies can she make? 
Answer:  She can make 2 pies because 3 x 2 = 6."
Response:  The tree had 6 apples at first.
Response:  The baum had 3 reife Ãpfel at the beginning.
Response:  The tree had 9 apples at first (7 from Rachel + 2 new ones).
Response: 5 apples are now on the tree (3 new ones + 2 original ones).
Response:  The tree had 8 apfels originally (7 + 2 = 8).
Response: 24 Ãpfel (3 x 8 = 24).
Response:  Rachel has picked 7 x 4 = 28 apples in total.
Response:  Doug has lost 4 murbles (19 - 2 = 4).
Response:  Ed had 45 Murmels and Doug lost 11 of his Murmels, so Doug has 11 fewer Murmels than Ed. Therefore, Ed has 45 - 11 = 34 more Murmels than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 22 murbles and Doug lost 7 of his own, then Doug has 7 fewer murbles than Ed. Therefore, Doug has  22 - 7 = 15 murbles now.
Response:  If Ed had 27 murals and Doug lost 3 of his murals on the playground, then Doug had 27 + 3 = 30 murals at the beginning.
"Response:  Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug to start with. After Doug lost 27 of his marbles and Ed found 9 more, we can calculate how many more marbles Ed has as follows:  
Let's say that Doug started with x marbles (since we don't know exactly how many he had). Then, after losing 27, he has x - 27 marbles left.  
Ed started with x + 24 marbles (again, since we don't know exactly how many he had), and then found 9 more, so he now has x + 24 + 9 = x + 33 marbles.  
Now, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has to find out how many more marbles Ed has:  
x + 33 - (x - 27) =?  
Simplifying this equation gives us:  
x + 33 - x - 27 =?  
33 - 27 =?  
6 =?  
So, Ed has 6 more marbles than Doug."
Response:  Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug to start with. If Ed lost 17 of his marbles on the playground, then he has 29 - 17 = 12 more marbles than Doug now.
Response:  Ed has lost  19 - 8 = 11 Murmels.
Response:  Ed had 91 + 30 = 121 Murmels more than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug and lost 20 of his marbles, then before losing the marbles, Ed had 12 + 20 = 32 marbles. Now that Ed has lost 20 marbles, he has 32 - 20 = 12 marbles left. Therefore, Doug must have had 12 marbles to begin with. So, Doug now has 12 + 0 = 12 marbles.
Response:  There are more students who have proposed adding kartoffelpÃ¼ree (408) than those who have proposed adding speck (42).
Response: 120 students have more speck suggested than kartoffelpÃ¼ree suggested (489 - 479 = 120).
Response:  There were 185 students who suggested adding Speck to the menu.
Response:  There were 264 students who suggested adding bacon and 288 - 264 = 24 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu.
"Response:  If 457 students suggested adding potato puree and 63 students more suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding bacon (Speck), then the number of students who suggested adding bacon is:  

457 - 63 =?"
Response:  If 166 students suggested adding more Speck to the menu than those who suggested adding KartoffelpÃ¼ree, then the number of students who suggested adding Speck is 166 - (182 - 166) = 166 - 15 = 151.
"Response:  To find out how many students participated in suggesting new food items, we need to add up the numbers of students who suggested each item:  
324 + 374 + 128 = 826  So, 826 students participated in suggesting new food items for the school menu."
"Response:  To determine how many students have proposed more potato puree than those who suggested bacon, we need to compare the number of proposals for each item. Let's do this by using numbers:  

Proposals for Potato Puree: 257  Proposals for Bacon: 120 

Now, let's subtract the fewer number of proposals (bacon) from the greater number of proposals (potato puree): 

257 - 120 = 137 

Therefore, 137 students have proposed more potato puree than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  To determine how many students have proposed more potato puree than tomatoes, we need to compare the number of students who proposed each ingredient. Let's use a bar graph to visualize this information.

Bar Graph:

| Ingredient | Number of Students Proposing |
| --- | --- |
| Potato Puree | 144 |
| Speck (Bacon) | 467 |
| Tomatoes | 79 |

From the graph, we can see that 144 students proposed potato puree, while 79 students proposed tomatoes. Therefore, there are more students who proposed potato puree than tomatoes. The difference between these two numbers is:

144 - 79 = 65

So, 65 more students proposed potato puree than tomatoes."
Response:  To determine how many students have suggested more speck than tomatoes, we need to compare the number of students who have suggested speck with the number of students who have suggested tomatoes. Let's do this by subtracting the number of students who have suggested tomatoes from the total number of students who have made suggestions (228 + 337 + 23 = 598). This gives us:  598 - 23 = 575. Therefore, there are 575 students who have suggested more speck than tomatoes.
Response: 38 + 450 = 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.
Response: 351 students suggested adding only Speck to the menu, while 218 students suggested adding both potato pudding and Speck. Therefore, there are 351 - 218 = 133 students who suggested adding Speck to the menu.
"Response:  To determine how many students have proposed more potato puree than those who suggested bacon, we need to compare the number of proposals for each ingredient. Let's do this by subtracting the number of proposals for bacon from the total number of proposals and dividing the result by the number of proposals for bacon:  
(Total number of proposals - Number of proposals for bacon) / Number of proposals for bacon = (269 + 330 + 76) - 269 / 269 = 851 - 269 / 269 = 582 / 269 = approximately 2.14 or 214% more students have proposed potato puree than bacon."
Response:  There are 569 - 236 = 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  The school has more boys (841) than girls (34).
Response:  There are 263 boys (485 - 232 = 263) in this school.
"Response:  There are 228 more girls than boys in this school. If there are x number of boys, then there would be x + 228 = total number of students.  
Solve for x to find out how many boys there are in the school."
Response:  There are 510 more boys than girls in this school. To find out how many boys there are, we can add 510 to the number of girls. So, if there are 635 girls, then there are:  635 + 510 = 1145 boys in this school.
Response:  There are 868 + 281 = 1149 students in this school.
Response:  There are 700 + 142 = 842 students in this school.
Response:  There are currently 706 + 418 = 1124 students in the school.
Response:  There are currently 902 + 44 = 946 girls in school.
Response:  There are 632 - 410 = 222 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  There are currently 732 + 682 = 1414 girls in school.
Response:  There are now (214 + 910) = 1124 boys in school.
Response:  There are 308 + 318 = 626 students in this school.
"Response:  There are 315 + 309 = 624 students in this school.  
Additionally, there are 772 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is 624 + 772 = 1396."
Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. If there are 739 girls in the school and 402 more girls than boys, we can set up an equation based on that information. Let x represent the number of boys in the school. Then, we know that the number of girls is 739 + x (since there are 402 more girls). To find out how many boys there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the school: Total Students = Number of Girls + Number of Boys Total Students = (739 + x) + x Total Students = 739 + 2x Now we need to solve for x, which represents the number of boys in the school. We can do this by subtracting 739 from both sides of the equation: 739 + 2x = Total Students - 739 2x = Total Students - 739 2x = 586 2x = 293 X = 146 Therefore, there are 146 boys in the school if there are 739 girls.
Response:  There are 692 + 458 = 1150 students in this school.
"Response:  There are 362 boys and 257 girls in the school initially. If 403 more girls have joined the school, then the total number of girls is:  

362 + 403 = 765  

Therefore, there are 765 girls in the school now, and the difference between the number of girls and boys is:  

765 - 362 = 403  

So, the school has 403 more girls than boys."
Response:  Edward has $2 left because he spent $16 of his original $18.  
Response:  $10 (Edward has spent $10)
"Response:  Edward had $25 before he spent his money.  
Explanation:  If Edward had $9 and then spent $8 more, that means he spent a total of $9 + $8 = $17. So, if he started with $9, he must have had $9 + $8 = $17 before he spent his money."
Response:  Edward had $16 + $6 = $22 before he spent his money.
Response:  Each book has costed $6.
Response:  Before Edward spent his money, he had $______________ (fill in the blank).
"Response:  For books, Edward spent $4 and for stifles, he spent $3, so in total, he has spent $7.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Let's say that the ball costs x cents. Then we know that the bat costs $1 + x cents. Since the bat and the ball together cost $1.10, we can set up an equation:
x + (1 + x) = 1.10
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 1 = 1.10
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:
2x =.10
Dividing by 2 gives us:
x =.05
So the ball costs 5 cents."
"Response:  Let's say that Eward spent x dollars for books and y dollars for stifles. We know that x + y = 16 (for books) and x + y = 8 (for stifles). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get: x = 12 and y = 4. So, Edward has spent 12 dollars more for books than for stifles.  
Question: What is the total amount of money that Edward has?  Answer: Based on the information given in the problem, Edward has $19. Therefore, his total amount of money is $19."
Response:  $27 (17 + 10)
"Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: 
Zachary made 44 LiegestÃ¼tze today in gym class. 
David made more than Zachary. 
We can let D be the number of LiegestÃ¼tze that David made.  Since David made more than Zachary, we know that D > 44 (since 44 is the number of LiegestÃ¼tze that Zachary made).  We also know that D = 58 + 44 (since David made 58 more than Zachary).  Therefore, we have the equation:  
D = 58 + 44 
Simplify the equation: 
D = 102 
So, David made 102 LiegestÃ¼tze and Zachary made 44 LiegestÃ¼tze."
Response: 7 (Zachary has made 7 more push-ups than David).
Response:  Zachary has made  35 LiegestÃ¼tze (44 - 9 = 35).
"Response:  Let's use ""D"" to represent David and ""Z"" to represent Zachary. We know that D made 51 LiegestÃ¼tze and Z made fewer than D by 49. So we can write an equation:  
D = 51  
Z = D - 49  
Now solve for Z:  
Z = 51 - 49  
Z = 2  
So Zachary has made 2 LiegestÃ¼tze and David has made 51."
Response:  David has made  59 + 19 = 78 LiegestÃ¼tze.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that Zachary did 44 LiegestÃ¼tze and 17 Crunches today in sports class. We also know that David did more LiegestÃ¼tze than Zachary but fewer Crunches. So let's use ""L"" for LiegestÃ¼tze and ""C"" for Crunches. The information given is: 
Zachary (Z) = 44L + 17C 
David (D) = Z + 29L - 13C 
We can simplify this equation by substituting D with its expression in terms of Z: 
D = Z + 29L - 13C 
Now we need to solve for C, which represents the number of crunches done by David. To do so, we will isolate C by subtracting 29L from both sides of the equation:  
D = Z + 29L - 13C 
D = Z + 29L - 13(44L + 17C) 
D = Z + 29L - 13(61L + C) 
D = Z + 29L - 13(61L + 17C) 
Simplify further by combining like terms: 
D = Z + 29L - 13(61L) - 13C 
D = Z + 29L - 804 - 13C 
D = Z + 29L - 817 
Since we are looking for C, we will isolate it by subtracting 29L from both sides of the equation again: 
D = Z + 29L - 817 
D - Z = -817 + 29L 
Subtracting Z from both sides gives us: 
D - Z = -522 
Now we have found C! Since David did 29 more LiegestÃ¼tze than Zachary, we know that David did 29 more than 44, or 73 LiegestÃ¼tze. Therefore, David did 73"
Response:  Zachary has made  53 + 14 = 67 exercises (LiegestÃ¼tze and Crunches).
Response:  Zachary has made more LiegestÃ¼tze than Crunches by  35 - 87 = 52.
Response:  Zachary has made more crunches than lying leg raises (Crunches > LiegestÃ¼tze). The difference is 58 - 46 = 12.
Response:  David has made  39 + 13 = 52 LiegestÃ¼tze.
"Response:  To find out how many push-ups John has done, we need to subtract David's number of push-ups from John's number of push-ups. We know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can start by finding out how many push-ups Zachary did:  
Zachary did 51 push-ups. Now we can find out how many push-ups David did:  
David did 51 + 22 = 73 push-ups. Finally, we can find out how many push-ups John did by subtracting David's number of push-ups from his own number of push-ups:  
John did 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups."
Response:  Zachary has made more sit-ups than John by (9 + 39) = 48 sit-ups.
Response:  Zachary has made  37 - 30 = 7 fewer liegestÃ¼tze than David.
"Response:  Let's say that Zachary has made x LiegestÃ¼tze. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:  
David has made 38 LiegestÃ¼tze more than Zachary, so we can write: 
We know that David has made 56 LiegestÃ¼tze more than Zachary, so we can substitute this value into the previous equation:  Solving for x, we get:  Therefore, Zachary has made 28 LiegestÃ¼tze and David has made 38 + 28 = 66 LiegestÃ¼tze altogether."
"Response:  Let's use ""D"" to represent David's number of sit-ups and ""Z"" to represent Zachary's number of sit-ups. We know that Z = 34 (given) and D + 17 < Z. So we can write an equation: D + 17 < 34. Simplifying the inequality, we get: D < 17. Therefore, David has made fewer than 17 sit-ups. But we also know that D > 0, so David must have made at least one sit-up. Thus, the exact value of D is: D = 1."
"Response:  Zachary has made more sit-ups than David (33 - 29 = 4).  

Question:  If David did 36 more push-ups today than he did yesterday, and he did 10 less push-ups yesterday than the day before, how many push-ups did David do two days ago? 
Answer:  Let's say that David did x push-ups two days ago. Since he did 10 fewer push-ups yesterday, he did x - 10 push-ups yesterday. And since he did 36 more push-ups today than he did yesterday, he did x + 36 push-ups today. We can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 36 = x + 10 + 36
Solving for x, we get:
x = 46
So, David did 46 push-ups two days ago."
Response:  Zachary has more sit-ups than liegestÃ¼tze by 12 (17 - 5 = 12).

Response:  Mary must add 9 more cups of flour (14 - 5 = 9) and an equal amount of sugar (6).
Response:  Mary needs to add more sugar (11 - 4 = 7) than flour (9).
Response:  Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 8/2 = 4 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary has added  2 x 4 = 8 cups of flour (Mehl) more than sugar.
Response:  The recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and some additional cups of flour (not specified). If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, she needs to add 6 more cups of flour for a total of 9 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary has already added 2 tanks of flour (2 x 6 = 12). Therefore, she still needs to add 2 more tanks of flour.
Response:  Mary needs to add  9 - 3 = 6 more tanks of flour (Mehl) and  5 - 62 = 48 less sugar (Zucker).
Response:  Mary needs to add  12 Tassen (14 - 2 = 12) more sugar to make the cake.
Response:  Mary needs to add  7 more tanks of flour (12 - 11 = 7).
Response:  Mary needs to add  2 \* (10 - 7) = 2 * 3 = 6 more cups of flour to have more cups of flour than cups of sugar.
Response:  She needs to add 5 more cups of flour (12 - 2 = 10).
"Response:  To determine how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added (5 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (6 cups):  

6 cups - 5 cups = 1 cup 

Since there are 8 cups of sugar in the recipe, and Mary needs to add 1 cup more, she should add 8/9 = 88% of the total amount of sugar (or approximately 80% of 8 cups). Therefore, Mary must add about 80% x 8 cups = 64 cups of sugar. 

To find out how much salt Mary needs to add, we can use the same method: 

6 cups - 5 cups = 1 cup 

There are 7 cups of salt in the recipe, so Mary needs to add 7/9 = 77% of the total amount of salt (or approximately 70% of 7 cups). Therefore, Mary must add about 70% x 7 cups = 49 cups of salt."
Response:  Mary must add  13 - 2 = 11 more cups of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  Mary needs to add more than  3 tanks of flour (9 - 4 = 5) to match the amount of sugar she has already added.
Response:  She needs to add 3 more cups of flour (9 - 2 = 7) and 6 more cups of sugar (6).
Response:  Mary needs to add  5 - 11 = 4 tasses of sugar to make the cake recipe.
Response:  Mary has added  5 * 10 = 50 Tassen Mehl.
Response:  She has already added 12 - 1 = 11 tasses of meal.
Response:  Mary needs to add 7 Tassen Mehl (14 - 7 = 7).
Response:  Mary needs to add  1 (one) tasse of sugar.
Response:  Mary needs to add  9 Tassen Mehl (10 - 6 = 9).
Response:  Mary needs to add  9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour (Mehl) to have more cups of flour than sugar.
Response:  She needs to add 5 more cups of flour (7 - 2 = 5).
Response:  Mary needs to add 4 tasses of sugar (11 - 7 = 4) more than she needs to add salt (9).
Response:  Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  Mary needs to add more flour (Mehl) than sugar because she has already added 10 cups of sugar and the recipe requires 12 cups of sugar plus 14 cups of flour. Therefore, she needs to add 4 cups of flour (14 - 10 = 4).
"Response:  There are 13 Vogelfamilien more that have flown away for the winter than those that have remained behind.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  The ball costs $0.10."
Response:  There are 87 - 7 = 80 Vogelfamilien left behind after 7 families have migrated for the winter.
Response:  There were 34 Vogelfamilien living near the mountain at the beginning of winter if 20 families migrated and 14 remained.
Response:  There are 85 - 23 = 62 Vogelfamilien left near the mountain.
Response:  There are more Vogelfamilien (42) that have flown to Africa than to Asia (31), so the difference is 11 (42 - 31).
Response:  There are more Vogelfamilien that have flown to Asia (94) than to Africa (47). The difference between the two numbers is 94 - 47 = 47. Therefore, there are 47 more Vogelfamilien that have flown to Asia than to Africa.
Response:  There are 18 Vogelfamilien that live near the mountain and 38 have flown to Africa, so 38 - 18 = 20 Vogelfamilien have flown away for the winter.
Response:  There are now 87 + 18 = 105 Vogelfamilien living near the mountain.
Response:  There were 49 + 24 = 73 Vogelfamilien in the area near the mountain after the winter migration.
Response:  There were 41 - 27 = 14 Vogelfamilien left in the area near the mountain after the winter migration.
Response: 86 - 45 = 41. More vogel families have flown away than have stayed behind.
"Response:  There are more Vogelfamilien (62) that have flown to Africa than to Asia (35).  

Question:  If it takes 8 hours for a bird to fly from the mountain to Africa and 10 hours for a bird to fly from the mountain to Asia, how many hours will it take for all of the birds to migrate to their wintering grounds? 
Answer:  To determine this, we need to add up the time it would take for each family of birds to migrate. Since there are 62 families flying to Africa and 35 families flying to Asia, we can calculate as follows:

Time to migrate to Africa = 62 x 8 = 504 hours
Time to migrate to Asia = 35 x 10 = 350 hours
Total time to migrate = 504 + 350 = 854 hours
Therefore, it will take all of the birds approximately 854 hours (or about 37 days) to migrate to their wintering grounds."
Response:  There were 26 new Vogelfamilien that arrived from the Arctic to live near the mountain, and 2 Vogelfamilien that migrated south for the winter, so there were 26 + 2 = 28 Vogelfamilien still present near the mountain.
Response: 253 - 70 = 183.
Response:  Paul received  551 - 177 = 374 Buntstiftchen for his birthday.
Response: 23 Buntstifte (440 - 111 + 106 = 23).
Response:  There were 65 Buntstifte at the beginning and 213 were given away, so there are 65 + 213 = 278 Buntstifte in total. Since 16 Buntstifte were lost or given away, there are 278 - 16 = 262 Buntstifte left.
Response: 571 - 161 = 410.
Response:  Paul has lost more than he gave to his friends. He lost 412 - 90 = 322 Buntstifte more than he gave away.
Response:  The number of buntstift that paul received as a birthday gift is 332.
Response:  The number of lost or given away markers is equal to  535 - 492 = 43.

Response: 8 customers have gone (11 - 3 = 8).
Response:  There were 4 customers left after some had gone, so 4 - 3 = 1 customer remained behind.
Response:  The kellner had 12 customers at the end, and 9 customers left, so he had 12 - 9 = 3 customers at the beginning.
Response: 9 (14 - 5 = 9)
"Response:  To find out how many customers have gone, we need to subtract the number of new customers (4) from the original number of customers (13). So, 9 customers are left, and 4 customers have gone.  
Question:  A bookshelf has 25 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. How many books can the bookshelf hold in total? 
Answer:  We know that each shelf can hold 8 books, so if there are 25 shelves, the bookshelf can hold 25 x 8 = 200 books in total."
Response:  The kellner had 12 customers at first and received 14 new customers while 15 customers left, so he has 12 + 14 = 26 customers in total.
Response: 5 new customers arrived (8 - 3 = 5).
"Response: 13 customers have gone.  
Explanation: The killer clue here is that after some of them had left (âafter some were goneâ), he still had five customers remaining. That means at least five customers must have stayed behind. So if we subtract five from eight to find out how many went away, we get three. Therefore, thirteen customers have gone."
Response:  The kellner had 12 customers initially and gained 10 new customers, so he has 12 + 10 = 22 customers now.

Response:  Danny has 53 + 12 = 65 Kronkorken now.
Response:  If Danny has 53 Kronkorken and he had 21 Kronkorken before, then he found 32 Kronkorken in the park (53 - 21 = 32).
Response:  To find out how many Kronkorken Danny had at first, we need to subtract the number of old ones he threw away (51) from the total number of Kronkorken he found in the park (63). So, Danny had 63 - 51 = 12 Kronkorken at first.
Response: 11 (36 - 35 = 11).
Response:  Danny has thrown away more bottle caps than he found in the park. He threw away 63 old ones and found 30 new ones, so he threw away 63 - 30 = 33 more bottle caps than he found.
"Response:  To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at the beginning, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps and packaging he has now. So, if he has 28 bottle caps and 63 packagings now, and he found 22 bottle caps and 8 packagings, then he must have had:  
28 - 22 = 6 more bottle caps at the beginning."
Response: 30.

Response:  If Jake has 17 apples and is missing 11, then Steven must have 11 + 17 = 28 apples.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:  
* Steven has 15 apples.  * Jill has fewer apples than Steven.  * Jake has fewer apples than Jill.  We can let ""x"" represent the number of apples that Jake has. Since Jill has fewer apples than Steven, we know that x < 15 (the difference between Jill and Steven is less than 15). Also, since Jake has fewer apples than Jill, we know that x < x + 7 (the difference between Jake and Jill is less than the difference between Jill and Steven plus 7). Simplifying these two inequalities, we get:  x + 7 < 15 - 7  x < 8 Now solve for x to find out how many apples Jake has.  Answer:  x = 8 So Jake has 8 apples."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:  
Jake has 18 fewer pears than Steven. So if Steven has x pears, Jake has x - 18 pears. 
Steven has 19 pears more than Jill. So if Jill has y pears, Steven has y + 19 pears.  We can set up two equations based on this information: 
x - (18) = y + 19... (1) 
x = y + 18... (2) Now solve equation (1) for x: 
x = y + 18 Substituting equation (2): 
y + 18 = y + 19 Solving for x: 
x = y + 19 Therefore, Jill has 19 pears."
Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:  1) Jake has 3 fewer than Steven. So if Steven has x Pfirsiche, then Jake has x - 3 Pfirsiche.  2) Jill has 8 more than Steven. So if Steven has x Pfirsiche, then Jill has x + 8 Pfirsiche.  Now let's substitute these expressions into our equation for Jake's number of Pfirsiche:  Jake has (x - 3) Pfirsiche.  We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:  Jake has x - 6 Pfirsiche.  Since Jill has x + 8 Pfirsiche, we can find out how many more Pfirsiche Jake has than Jill by subtracting their two expressions:  Jake has x - 6 - (x + 8) = -2x + 14 Pfirsiche more than Jill.  Therefore, Jake has 14 more Pfirsiche than Jill.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:  
Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven. So if Steven has x pears, Jake has x - 12 pears. 
Steven has 4 more pears than Jill. So if Jill has y pears, Steven has y + 4 pears.  We can set up an equation based on this information: 
x - 12 = y + 4  Now solve for y (the number of pears Jill has): 
y = x - 8 To find out how many more pears Jill has than Jake, subtract Jake's pear count from Jill's pear count: 
y - (x - 12) = Jill's pear count - Jake's pear count 
Substituting y = x - 8 and solving for Jill's pear count gives us: 
(x - 8) - (x - 12) = Jill's pear count - Jake's pear count 
-4 = Jill's pear count - Jake's pear count 
We know that Jill has 4 more pears than Steven, so Jill's pear count is 4 more than Steven's pear count: 
Jill's pear count = Steven's pear count + 4 
Now substitute x = 10 (since Steven has 10 pears), to find Jill's pear count: 
Jill's pear count = 10 + 4 = 14 
Therefore, Jill has 14 more pears than Jake."
Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know about Jake's number of pears based on the information given in the problem. We know that Jake has 7 fewer than Steven and 9 more than Jill. So, if Steven has 16 pears, then Jake must have:  16 - 7 = 9 pears.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:  
Jake has 7 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 Pfirsiche. 
Steven has 17 Pfirsiche. 
Jake has 8 more than Jill, so Jill has 10 + 8 = 18 Pfirsiche."
Response:  Steven has 16 + 18 = 34 more pears than Jill.
"Response:  Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem. We know that Steven has 18 more apples than Jill, so we can write an equation based on this information: 
Steven has = Jill + 18   Now, we are also told that Jake has 6 fewer apples than Jill, so we can write another equation based on this information: 
Jake has = Jill - 6  Using these two equations, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for Jake's number of apples. First, we will substitute the expression for Steven's number of apples into the equation for Jake's number of apples: 
Jake has = Jill - 6 (Steven has) Substituting Jill's number of apples from the first equation, we get: 
Jake has = (Jill + 18) - 6 Jake has = Jill + 12 - 6 Jake has = Jill + 6 This tells us that Jake has 6 apples. Therefore, the correct answer is 6."
"Response:  Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem. We know that Steven has 18 more than Jill, so we can write an equation based on this fact: 
Steven - Jill = 18... (1) Now, we are also told that Jake has 5 fewer than Jill, so we can write another equation based on this fact: 
Jake - Jill = -5... (2) Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Jake and Jill). Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of Jake and Jill. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:  
Steven - Jill = 18 Jake - Jill = -5 Putting them together, we get:  
Steven - Jake = 13 + Jill So now we need to solve for Jake and Jill. First, let's find out what Jake has: 
Jake has 5 fewer than Jill, so Jake has 5 less than 87: 
Jake has 87 - 5 = 82 Pfirsiche Now, let's find out how many Pfirsiche Jill has: 
Jill has 87 + 5 = 92 Pfirsiche Therefore, Jake has fewer Pfirsiche than Jill by 92 - 82 = 10 Pfirsiche. In other words, Jake has 10 fewer Pfirsiche than Jill."
Response:  Jill has 12 + (15 - 16) = 12 + (-4) = 12 + (-4) = 8 more pears than Jake.
"Response:  Let's use ""J"" to represent Jake and ""S"" to represent Steven. We know that J has 12 fewer pears than S, so we can write an equation based on this information: 

J = S - 12 
We also know that S has 19 pears, so we can substitute this into our first equation:  

J = S - 12 
J = 19 - 12 
J = 7 
Therefore, Jake (J) has 7 pears."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven, so if Steven has x pears, Jake has x - 13 pears. We also know that Steven has 9 pears and 8 apples, so we can write an equation based on this information:  
x + (x - 13) = 9 + 8  
2x - 13 = 17  
2x = 30  
x = 15  
Now we know that Steven has 15 pears and 8 apples. Since Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven, Jake has 15 - 13 = 2 pears. Therefore, Jake has 2 pears."
Response:  Steven has 3 more pears than apples (16 - 13 = 3).
Response:  Steven has 3 more apples than pears (15 - 12 = 3).
Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that Steven has 12 pfirsiches, and Jake has 4 fewer than Steven. We also know that Steven has 67 more pfirsiches than Jill. So let's use algebra to solve for Jake's number of pfirsiches!  ðð First, we can write an equation based on the information given:  S = 12 (Steven's number of pfirsiches) J = S - 4 (Jake's number of pfirsiches) J = 12 - 4 J = 8 Now we know that Jake has 8 pfirsiches. ð But wait, there's more! Since Steven has 67 more pfirsiches than Jill, we can set up another equation:  S = J + 67 S = 8 + 67 S = 75 And there you have it! Not only did we figure out how many pfirsiches Jake has, but we also found out how many pfirsiches Steven and Jill have! ð
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know about the situation:  
* Steven has 18 pears. 
* Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven. 
* Steven has 8 more pears than Jill.  We can use this information to find out how many pears Jill has. First, let's determine how many pears Jake has:  If Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven, then Jake has:  
18 - 12 = 6 pears. Now, we can find out how many pears Jill has:  Since Steven has 8 more pears than Jill, Jill has:  
18 - 8 = 10 pears. Therefore, Jill has 10 pears."
Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that Steven has 19 Pfirsiche, and Jake has 12 fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from 19, we get:  19 - 12 =?  That gives us our answer! Jake has 7 Pfirsiche.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know about the situation:  
* Steven has 14 pfirsiches.  * Jake has 6 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 pfirsiches.  * Jill has 3 more than Jake, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 pfirsiches.  Therefore, Jill has 11 pfirsiches."
Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, and Steven has 13 pears and 52 apples. So let's use algebra to solve for the number of pears Jake has.   First, we can write an equation based on the information given:   Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 84 + 52 = 136 apples.  Since Jake also has pears, he must have fewer apples than Steven. Therefore, we can subtract the number of apples Steven has from the total number of apples Jake has:  136 - 52 = 84.  Now we know that Jake has 84 pears.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, and Steven has 8 pears and 12 apples. So let's use algebra to solve for the number of apples Jake has.  
Let J represent the number of apples Jake has. Then we can write an equation based on the information given: 
J = S + 13... (1) where S is the number of apples Steven has. Substituting the value of S from the problem into equation (1), we get: 
J = 8 + 13... (2) Simplifying equation (2), we get: 
J = 21... Therefore, Jake has 21 apples."

Response:  Gwen has spent $2 dollars ($7 - $5 = $2).
Response:  Gwen has received $14 for her birthday ($8 + $6).
Response:  If Gwen received $2 from her mother and $4 from her father, for a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:  
Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 more from her father, for a total of $13. She spent $4, so she has $9 left. To find out how much more money Gwen received from her mother than from her father, we need to subtract the amount she received from her father from the amount she received from her mother.  So, we can set up an equation:  
$8 - $5 = $9  Simplifying the equation:  
$8 - $5 = $3  Therefore, Gwen received $3 more from her mother than from her father."
Response:  $6 - $3 = $3 more from father than mother.
Response:  $7 - $5 = $2 more from mother than father.
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, for a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she has $1 more from her father than from her mother.
Response: 5 (Josh had 9 murmurs and now has 4, so he lost 5 murmurs.)

Response: 8 - 4 = 4 more lost than found.
Response: 3 (10 - 8 = 3)
Response: 28 (21 + 7)
Response: 18 (20 - 2 = 18)
Response:  Josh has 22 - 20 = 2 Murmels left.
Response:  If Josh had 19 marbles before and lost 11, then he has 8 marbles left (19 - 11 = 8).
Response: 22 + 13 - 5 = 20.
Response: 23 - 9 = 14. Josh has lost more Murmels than he found (14).
"Response: 2 Murmel. 
Explanation:  Josh had 3 Murmels to start with and found 6 more, so he has a total of 3 + 6 = 9 Murmels. He lost 5 Murmels, leaving him with 9 - 5 = 4 Murmels. Therefore, he has found more Murmels than he lost (2 = 4 - 3)."

Response:  The weight of Marco's father's strawberries was heavier by 16 pounds (26 - 10 = 16) than Marco's strawberries.
Response:  If Marco and his father's strawberries together weighed 30 pounds, then Marco's strawberries must have weighed 30 - 11 = 19 pounds.
"Response: 8 children are now more in the bus than before the bus stop.  
Explanation: The initial number of children who were in the bus was 2 (the two kinderfuhr). At the bus stop, more children got into the bus, so there were a total of 10 children in the bus. Therefore, 8 children (10 - 2 = 8) are now more in the bus than they were before the bus stop."
Response: 64 children are now on the bus (26 + 38).
"Response:  There were x children before the bus stop who rode the bus.  

Question: How many children got off at the bus stop if there were initially 41 children on the bus and only 39 children remained after some children got off? 
Answer:  If there were initially 41 children on the bus and only 39 children remained after some children got off, then 2 children must have gotten off at the bus stop."
"Response: 22 children have not gotten out of the bus at the bus stop.  
Question:   44 In a bag, there are 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 3 green balls. If a child randomly selects one ball from the bag, what is the probability that they will choose a blue ball?  Based on the information provided, formulate a numerical answer.  Answer: The probability of choosing a blue ball is 7/19 or approximately 0.368 (three-sixths)."
Response: 23 children were in the bus before the bus stop, since there were 41 children and 18 children got out of the bus at the bus stop.
"Response: 6 children entered the bus at the bus stop.  
Explanation: The total number of children who were on the bus was 16 (given). If 10 children got off the bus and some others got on, then the number of children who got on the bus must be equal to the difference between the original total and the new total, which is:

16 - 10 = 6

Therefore, 6 children entered the bus at the bus stop."
"Response: 8 children more entered the bus than exited.  
Explanation: To find out how many children entered the bus more than exited, we need to subtract the number of children who exited from the total number of children inside the bus. In this case, if there were 14 children inside the bus and 63 children exited, then 63 - 14 = 49 children more entered the bus than exited."
Response: 56 children got off the bus (68 - 12 = 56).
"Response: 38 children have exited the bus at the bus stop.  
Explanation: If 40 children entered the bus and 2 were already inside, then 40 - 2 = 38 children exited the bus at the bus stop."
Response: 54 children (82 - 30 = 54) more entered the bus than exited.
"Response: 6 children have gotten out of the bus more than had entered it.  
Explanation: The number of children who entered the bus is equal to the difference between the total number of children and those who exited the bus (24 - 8 = 16). Therefore, six children have left the bus more than they entered it."
"Response:  The baker has made more than he sold if we subtract the number of cakes sold (51) from the total number of cakes made (133):  
133 - 51 = 82."
Response:  The baker has sold  54 - 13 = 41 kuchens.
Response:  The baker has made   =  145 +  72 = 217 kuchens.
Response:  The baker would have 155 - 140 = 15 Kuchen (Kuchen) left after his friend bought 140 pieces of cake from him.
Response:  The baker has 46 kuchens left (121 - 105 = 46).
Response:  The baker has bought more cakes (154) than he has sold (91). So, the difference is 63 cakes (154 - 91 = 63).
Response:  The baker has sold more cakes than he has bought because 78 - 31 = 47. Therefore, the baker has sold 47 more cakes than he has bought.
Response:  The baker has 39 kuchens left (110 - 75 = 39).
Response:  The baker has made more than he sold because 111 - 71 = 40 kuchens more.
Response:  The baker would have 59 Kuchen (149 - 10) left after selling 10 Kuchen and 90 GebÃ¤ckstÃ¼cke.
Response:  The baker has 25 (15 - 7 = 25) kuchens left and 45 (103 - 148 = 45) gebÃ¤ckstÃ¼cks left.
"Response:  The baker has made more kuchen (126) than gebÃ¤ckstÃ¼cke (48). Therefore, the difference between the number of kuchen and the number of gebÃ¤ckstÃ¼cke is:  
126 - 48 = 78."
Response:  The baker has made more than twice as many pastries (131) as cakes (19). Therefore, the difference between the number of pastries and cakes is at least 2 times 19 = 38. So the baker has made at least 38 more pastries than cakes.
"Response:  The baker has sold more kuchen (158) than gebÃ¤ckstÃ¼cke (147).

Response:  To find out how many games Kelly needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of games she already has (22) from the total number of games she wants to have (140). So, we can use subtraction:  140 - 22 = 118. Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games.
"Response:  Kelly will have 42 games left after giving away 64 games.  
Question:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and gives away 32 of them, how many does she have left? 
Answer:  After giving away 32 games, Kelly will have 74 games left."
Response:  Kelly had originally 92 - 91 = 1 Nintendo games.
Response:  Kelly must give up 8 Nintendo games (20 - 12 = 8).
Response:  If Kelly has 132 Sony games and wants to have 31 Sony games left after giving some away, she must give away 101 games (132 - 31 = 101).
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and finds 31 more, she will have a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. To keep 6 games, she must give back 111 - 6 = 105 games.
Response:  Randy had x blocks to start with, where x is equal to 38 (the number of blocks left after building the tower).
Response:  Randy has used  72 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  Randy has 79 blocks and uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. Therefore, he has 79 - (14 + 11) = 79 - 25 = 54 blocks left over.
Response:  Randy has used a total of 27 + 53 = 80 blocks to build the tower and the house.
Response: 4 (Randy has used 4 more blocks to build the tower than to build the house).
"Response: 3 blocks more to build the house than the tower.  
Explanation: To find out how many blocks Randy has used for each structure, we need to subtract the number of blocks he has used for one from the other. Let's do that:

For the tower: 79 blocks - 86 blocks = -7 blocks (negative because he hasn't used all the blocks)

For the house: 82 blocks - 86 blocks = -4 blocks (also negative because he hasn't used all the blocks)

Now, let's compare the two differences:

-7 blocks vs -4 blocks. The difference between these two is 3 blocks (since -7 is less than -4). Therefore, Randy has used 3 more blocks to build the house than the tower."
Response: 23 blocks would be left over (59 - 36 = 23).
Response:  Randy has used more blocks to build the tower (50) than to build the house (20). Therefore, he has used 30 more blocks to build the tower than the house.
Response:  Randy has used more blocks to build the house (89) than to build the tower (63). Therefore, he has used 26 more blocks to build the house than the tower.
"Response:  I have read 15 books of the series ""VerrÃ¼ckte alberne Schule"" (15/20)."
"Response:  There are 21 books in the series ""VerrÃ¼ckte dumme Schule"" (crazy silly school) if you have read 13 and still have 8 to read."
Response:  To find out how many books you still need to read, subtract the number of books you have already read (12) from the total number of books (22):  22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, you still need to read 10 more books.
Response:  To see how many films you still need to watch, we can subtract the number of books you have read (19) from the total number of films and books combined (4 + 17 = 21). Therefore, you still need to watch 21 - 19 = 2 films.
"Response:  There are more books (19) than films (13) in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  There are more films (61) than books (19) in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  The number of books read is 13 and the number of films watched is 12. To find out how many more books have been read than films watched, we need to subtract the number of films from the number of books:  
13 - 12 = 1 Therefore, the person has read one more book than they have watched films."
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 21 films, then you have watched more than twice as many films as books (21 - 7 = 14).
Response: 6 books left to read.
Response:  To find out how many books you still need to read, subtract the number of books you have already read (4) from the total number of books (19):  19 - 4 = 15. Therefore, you still need to read 15 more books.
Response:  To find out how many films you still need to watch, we can use subtraction. If you have seen 4 of the films and there are 8 in total, then you have seen 4/8 = 0.5 or half of the films. Since you haven't seen all of them yet, you still need to watch half of 8 = 4 more films.
"Response:  There are more books (15) than films (11 + 40 = 51) in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  There are more films (63) than books (13) in the series ""Crazy Silly School"".  

Question:  If you have read all of the books and seen all of the movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series, how many stories do you know? 
Answer:  If you have read all of the books (13) and seen all of the movies (63), then you know a total of 76 stories from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
Response: 5 more books than films have been read (19 - 14 = 5).
Response: 3 more films than books have been read (19 - 16 = 3).

Response:  Dave has used more tickets for Spielzeug (12) than for Kleidung (7).
Response:  Dave has used more tickets for clothing (18) than for toys (8).
Response:  If Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets in the arcade, then he has a total of 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he has used 10 tickets for toys, then he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left.
Response: 5 trees have died during the typhoon and 5 trees have survived.
Response: 7 (13 - 6 = 7).
Response: 16 (20 - 4 = 16)
Response:  If 5 trees have died after a typhoon and there are still 12 trees left, then Haley planted 17 trees (12 + 5 = 17) in her backyard.
Response:  Haley has 9 - 4 = 5 trees left after the typhoon.
Response:  Haley had 12 trees in her backyard initially and 2 of them died due to the typhoon, so she has 12 - 2 = 10 trees left in her backyard now.
Response: 10 (13 - 3 = 10).
Response:  If Haley had 11 trees in her backyard initially and 2 have died due to the typhoon, then she has 9 trees left (11 - 2 = 9).
Response:  They harvest 66 x 28 = 1848 oranges per day.
"Response:  To find out how many days are needed to harvest 24 sacks of oranges, we can divide 24 by 8, which gives us:  

24 / 8 = 3 days"
"Response:  They will harvest 14 sacks of oranges per day if they harvest for 4 days and collect a total of 56 sacks of oranges.  

Question:  If it takes 3 people 6 hours to paint a house, how long will it take for one person to paint the same house?  Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  One person will need 18 hours to paint the house if three people can do it in 6 hours."
"Response:  To find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 49 days of harvesting, we need to multiply the number of sacks per day by the number of days. So, if they harvest 38 sacks per day and there are 49 days of harvesting, then they will have:  
38 sacks/day x 49 days = 1764 sacks 
Therefore, after 49 days of harvesting, they will have 1764 sacks of oranges."
Response:  To find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they will harvest in 87 days. We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows:   Total number of oranges = Number of sacks x Number of oranges per sack   Total number of oranges = 66 x 25   Total number of oranges = 1650   Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, they will have 1650 x 87 = 143,500 oranges.
Response:  They harvest 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  To find out how many days are needed to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we need to divide 80 by the number of oranges per day. We know that each day they harvest 16 sacks and each sack contains 57 oranges, so we can calculate as follows:  80 / (16 x 57) = 80 / 924 = approximately 0.09 days or 1 day and about 9 hours.
"Response:  To find out how many oranges are harvested when 35 sacks of oranges are gathered, we need to multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:  
35 sacks x 12 oranges/sack = 420 oranges  So, when 35 sacks of oranges are collected, there will be 420 oranges harvested."
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting oranges, they will have collected 3690 sacks (74 x 51).
Response:  The farmers harvest 76 sacks of oranges per day, and each sack contains 50 oranges, so they harvest 76 x 50 = 3800 oranges per day.
"Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected  

(28 x 26) + (52 x 26) = 744 + 1320 = 2064 sacks of oranges."
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected  82 x 25 = 2050 sacks of ripe oranges.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 24 x 45 = 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.
Response:  There are 19 more sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day than immature oranges (44 - 25 = 19).
Response:  There are 74 - 5 = 69 more sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day than ripe oranges.
"Response:  It took 3 days to harvest all the oranges if they were able to harvest 18 sacks of oranges per day.  

Question:  If it takes 2 men 6 hours to paint a house, how long will it take for 4 men to paint the same house?  Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  It will take 3 hours for 4 men to paint the same house."
Response:  They have ernted 56 sacks of oranges in total and they have done it in 14 days, so they have ernted  56/14 = 4 sacks per day.
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 5 sacks per day x 73 days = 365 sacks of ripe oranges.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 65 = 390 sacks of unripe oranges.
Response:  There are 86 - 41 = 45 more sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day than unripe oranges.
Response:  There are 14 more sacks of unripe oranges harvested daily than ripe oranges (71 - 60 = 14).
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 feet longer than its width. Therefore, if the width is 11 feet, then the length would be 12 + 11 = 23 feet long.
Response:  To find out how broad Jessie's room is, we need to divide the area of the rug by its length. We know that the rug measures 14 square feet and Jesse's zimmer is 7 feet long. So, we can calculate the width of her room as follows:   Width = Area / Length   Width = 14 sq ft / 7 ft   Width = 2 sq ft or 24 inches Now we have found out that Jesse's room is 24 inches wide.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 20 feet (14 square feet x 7 feet per square foot).
"Response:  To determine how much more carpeting Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we need to find out how many square feet of carpeting she already has and subtract that from the total number of square feet of floor space in her room. Let's do this:  
Jesse's room is 11 feet long x 15 feet wide = 165 square feet (total) - 16 square feet (carpeting she already has) = 149 square feet (more carpeting needed)."
Response:  To determine how many flies are needed to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the size of each fly. There are 2 feet x 12 feet = 24 square feet in the room. Since each fly is 4 square feet, we can divide 24 by 4 to get the number of flies needed:  24 / 4 = 6 Therefore, Jesse needs 6 flies to cover the entire floor.
Response:  To calculate how much carpet is needed to cover all of Jesse's rooms, we need to find the total area of each room and then add up that amount. The formula for finding the area of a rectangle (which is what each room is) is: Area = Length x Width. Since Jesse has 19-foot long rooms and 18-foot wide rooms, we can plug those numbers into the formula like this: Area = 19 x 18 = 352 square feet per room. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we multiply the number of rooms by the area of one room to get the total area needed: Total Area Needed = 20 x 352 = 7,040 square feet of carpet.
Response:  Jesses Zimmer is 20 feet long and 19 feet wide, so it is longer than it is wide by 1 foot (20 - 19 = 1).
"Response:  To find out how wide Jesse's room is, we need to divide the area of the room by the size of the rug. Since the room is 5 feet long and Jesse needs a rug that is 10 square feet, we can calculate the width of the room as follows:  
Width = Area / Length  Width = (10 sq ft) / 5 ft  Width = 2 ft  Therefore, Jesse's room is 2 feet wide."
Response:  To find out how long Jesse's room is, we need to divide the area of the room (which is 2 x 2 = 4 square feet) by the size of the rug (which is 10 square feet). So, we can say that Jesse's room is 4/10 = 0.4 or 40% of the length of the rug. Therefore, Jesse's room is 40% of 10 feet long, which is 4 feet long.
"Response:  To determine how much more teppich Jesse needs to cover the entire floor of her room, we need to calculate the total area of the room in square feet. The length of the room is 4 feet, and the width is 20 feet, so the total area is:  
Area = Length x Width = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet, she needs an additional 80 - 18 = 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor."
"Response:  To find out how many T-Shirts were sold, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say x is the number of T-Shirts sold. We know that the profit from each T-Shirt is $23, so the total profit from all T-Shirts sold would be:  
Profit = Number of T-Shirts x Profit per T-Shirt 
We also know that the total profit was $230, so we can substitute this into our equation:  
Profit = 230 
Now we need to solve for x (the number of T-Shirts sold). To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the profit per T-Shirt ($23):  
x = 230 / 23 
x = 10 
So, they sold 10 T-Shirts."
Response:  To find out how much each T-Shirt costs, we need to divide the total amount of money earned by the number of T-Shirts sold:  51 dollars / 3 T-Shirts = 17 dollars per T-Shirt.
"Response:  To find out how much money they have earned from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to know how many T-shirts they sold during that game. The problem states that they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game. We can use the information given in the problem to calculate their earnings as follows:  
Earnings = (Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt)  Earnings = (47 x $87)  Earnings = $3,969  Therefore, they have earned $3,969 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game."
"Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of T-shirts sold. Let's do that:  

Total T-shirts sold = 242 
T-shirts sold during Arkansas game = 115 
Therefore, T-shirts sold during Texas Tech game = Total - Arkansas 
= 242 - 115 
= 127 
So, they sold 127 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  To find out how much money they have made selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to know how many t-shirts they sold during that game. The problem states that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. We can multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt to find out how much money they made:  89 x $98 = $8,722  So, they made $8,722 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
"Response:  To find out how much money they have earned during the Texas Tech game by selling t-shirts, we need to subtract the number of shirts sold at the Arkansas game from the total number of shirts sold. Let's do that:  

Total Shirts Sold = 186 
Shirts Sold at Arkansas Game = 172 

Now, let's subtract the number of shirts sold at the Arkansas game from the total number of shirts sold:  

186 - 172 = 14 

So, they have sold 14 more t-shirts during the Texas Tech game than they did during the Arkansas game. Since each t-shirt costs $78, we can calculate their earnings as follows:  

14 x $78 = $1,092 

Therefore, they have earned $1,092 during the Texas Tech game through the sale of t-shirts."
Response:  The Razorback Shop has earned $62 x 183 = $11,466 from the sale of T-shirts and $99 x 31 = $3,099 from the sale of trikots, for a total of $14,565.
"Response:  To find out how much money they have earned from selling trikots, we need to multiply the number of trikots sold by the price per trikot. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:  
74 x $ 165 = $ 12,390 
So, they have earned $ 12,390 from selling trikots during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech."
"Response:  To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a trikot, we need to subtract the cost of a trikot from the cost of a t-shirt. Let's do that:  
$192 - $34 = $158 So, a T-shirt costs $158 more than a trikot."
"Response:  To find out how much more expensive a trikot is than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a trikot.  
$232 - $86 = $146  Therefore, a trikot costs $146 more than a t-shirt."
"Response:  To find out how much money they have earned from selling the t-shirts, we need to calculate the total amount of money they received from the sales. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  
1. Original price per t-shirt = $51 2. Discount per t-shirt = $8 3. Number of t-shirts sold = 130 4. Total amount received from sales = (Number of t-shirts x Original price per t-shirt) - (Number of t-shirts x Discount per t-shirt) Now let's plug in the values:  Total amount received from sales = (130 x $51) - (130 x $8) Total amount received from sales = $6,330 - $9,600 Total amount received from sales = $3,270 The Razorback T-Shirt Shop has earned $3,270 from the sale of 130 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech."
"Response:  To find out how much money they have made from selling the t-shirts, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold with the increased price per t-shirt.

Total Amount Earned = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Increased Price Per T-Shirt
= 14 x (201 + 217)
= 14 x 418
= 5,792

Therefore, they have made $5,792 from selling the t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech."
"Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say x is the number of T-shirts sold. We know that the total revenue from T-shirt sales was $60 and each T-shirt costs $10. So, we can write the equation as follows:  

x x = 60 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 60 / 10 

x = 6 

Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop has sold 6 T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech."
"Response:  To find out how much each T-shirt costs, we need to divide the total amount of money earned by the number of T-shirts sold:  

$$ \text{Cost per T-shirt} = \frac{\$215}{\text{number of T-shirts}} $$

We are given that 5 T-shirts were sold, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:  

$$ \text{Cost per T-shirt} = \frac{\$215}{5} $$

Solving for the cost per T-shirt, we get:  

$$ \text{Cost per T-shirt} = \$43 $$

Therefore, each T-shirt costs $43."
"Response:  To find out how much money they have earned from selling T-shirts, we need to multiply the number of T-shirts sold by the price per T-shirt, which is $215. Therefore, the total amount earned from selling T-shirts is:  

$215 x 20 = $4,300

So, they have earned $4,300 from selling T-shirts."
"Response:  To find out how much money they have earned from selling trikots, we need to multiply the number of trikots sold by the price per trikot. In this case, that would be:  

$ 204 x 2 = $ 408 

So, they have earned $ 408 from selling trikots."
"Response:  To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a trikot, we need to subtract the price of a trikot from the price of a t-shirt. Let's do that:  
$240 - $210 = $30 
So, a T-shirt costs $30 more than a trikot."
"Response:  To find out how much more expensive a trikot is than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a trikot.  
$115 (trikot) - $25 (t-shirt) = $90 
So, a trikot costs $90 more than a t-shirt."
Response:  They have more chairs (5 x 10 = 50) than tables (5).
Response:  There are 6 stools for each table, and there are 2 tables, so there are 6 x 2 = 12 stools in total.
Response:  They have 3 tables with 3 chairs each, so they have 3 x 3 = 9 chairs in total.
Response:  They have 11 x 13 = 143 stools in their backyard.
Response:  There will be 4 stools left unoccupied if 11 people sit on chairs at a party held in the backyard with 10 table sets and each set having 6 chairs.
Response:  The host has 12 table sets with 14 chairs each, for a total of 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Additionally, they have 6 extra chairs, so they have a total of 168 + 6 = 174 chairs available for guests.
Response:  To determine how many additional chairs are needed for the party, we need to subtract the total number of seats available from the total number of participants. In this case, there are 4 tables with 3 chairs each, for a total of 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since 14 people will be attending the party and 12 chairs are already available, we need to purchase 14 - 12 = 2 additional chairs.
Response:  They have more chairs than tables because they have 14 chairs for every 9 table sets, which means they have 5 extra chairs (14 - 9 = 5).
Response:  $92 per week (460 / 5 weeks).
Response:  The harvest lasted for 8 weeks (1216 / 16 = 8).

"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week during each of the 223 weeks of an agricultural season and works for 73 such seasons, he will earn a total of:  

$1357 x 223 = $309,811"
"Response:  During the harvest season (1091 weeks), Lewis earns $28 per week for his regular work and an additional $939 per week for overtime, for a total of:  
$28 x 1091 = $31,548 + $939 x 1091 = $1,067,898"
Response:  During the harvest season (233 weeks), Lewis earns $403 per week minus $49 per week in rent, resulting in a total of $354 per week ($403 - $49).
Response:  During the harvest season (1359 weeks), Lewis pays $388 per week in rent, for a total of $52,072 in rent payments ($388 x 1359).
"Response:  After paying rent of $216 per week for 1181 weeks (20 years), Lewis will have $357,524 left at the end of the harvest period.  

Question:  If Lewis spends $12,000 to buy a new tractor and pays cash, how much money will he have after the purchase? 
Answer:  After buying a new tractor for $12,000 and paying cash, Lewis will be left with $345,524."
Response:  Lewis earns $133 for 19 weeks of harvest, which is a total of 133 x 19 = $2487. Therefore, he earns $2487 / 19 weeks = $125 per week.
Response:  The number of weeks that the harvest lasted is  178 / 2 = 89 weeks.
"Response:  If Dean is 9 feet (108 inches) tall and the water depth is 10 times his height, then the water depth would be:  

10 x 9 = 90 feet deep"
Response:  If Ron is 14 feet tall and Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, then Dean is 6 feet (8 x 2) shorter than Ron. So, if Ron stands in water that is 2 times his height, the water would be 2 x 14 = 28 feet deep.
Response:  The water was 60 feet deep (5 times Ron's height of 12 feet).
Response:  If Ron is 13 feet tall and Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, then Dean is 13 + 4 = 17 feet tall. The water is 15 times deeper than Dean's height, so the depth of the water is 17 x 15 = 255 feet deep.
Response:  If Ron is 13 feet tall and Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, then Dean is 13 + 9 = 22 feet tall. The water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, so the depth of the water is 22 x 16 = 352 feet deep.
Response:  If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, then Dean is 9 feet shorter than Ron (since 9 x 6 = 54). Therefore, the water depth was 54 feet deep (since 9 times Dean's height equals the difference between Ron's height and Dean's height).
Response:  There are 34 books and 2 bookshelves. If we divide 34 by 2, we get 17. Therefore, there are 17 books on each bookshelf.
Response:  If Bryan has 42 books and each bookshelf can hold 2 books, then he has 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves.
"Response:  To find out how many books Bryan has overall, we need to multiply the number of bookshelves he has (23) by the number of books per shelf (27). Therefore, the total number of books is:  
23 x 27 = 611 books"
Response:  Bryan has 9 x 46 = 324 time magazines altogether.
Response:  Bryan has 23 x 29 = 677 books and 61 x 29 = 1899 magazines. In total, he has 677 + 1899 = 2576 items.
Response:  There are 4 books in each bookshelf because 28 books total / 7 bookshelves = 4 books per shelf.
Response:  If Bryan has 38 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then he has 38/2 = 19 bookshelves.
Response:  To ensure that no friend is left out, Carol needs to send out  20 packages (2 x 10 friends).
"Response:  There are x Einladungen in each packaging.  
Question: How many Einladungen have Carol bought altogether?  Answer:  Carol has bought 3 times x Einladungen altogether."
Response:  If Carol has bought 7 packages of invitations and each package contains 10 invitations, then she has a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. If she sends only 2 invitations to her friends, then the number of invitations remaining with her is 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  Carol can invite 14 x 6 = 84 friends to her party plus 11 additional friends for a total of 95 guests.
Response:  To determine how many additional invitations Carol needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of invitations she has already bought (2 packages x 3 invitations per package = 6 invitations) from the total number of friends she wants to invite (9). Therefore, Carol needs to buy 9 - 6 = 3 additional invitations.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she has overall scored 36 points, then she must have played 3 games.  

Question:  A bat and ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Let X be the cost of the ball. Then we know that the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, so the cost of the bat is X + $1.00. Together, the bat and ball cost $1.10, so we can set up the equation:
X + (X + $1.00) = $1.10
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2X + $1.00 = $1.10
Subtracting $1.00 from both sides gives us:
2X = $0.10
Dividing by 2 gives us:
X = $0.05
So the ball costs $0.05."
"Response:  Melissa scored 27 points in each game.  
Explanation: Since Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points, she must have scored 27 points in each game (81 points / 3 games = 27 points per game)."
Response:  In 79 games, Melissa scored (109 x 79) = 8691 points + (82 x 79) = 6538 bonus points = 8691 + 6538 = 15229 points.
Response:  If Melissa scored 7 points in each game and she erzielte overall 21 points, then she played 3 games (21 / 7 = 3).
"Response:  Melissa scored 7 points in each game.  
Explanation:  Since she erzielte overall 91 points and played 13 games, she scored 7 points in each game (91 / 13 = 7)."
Response:  Each seat can hold 5 people, so 20 people / 5 people per seat = 4 seats.
Response:  The Ferris wheel has 18 seats x 9 people per seat = 162 seats.
Response:  There are 20 RiesenrÃ¤der with 19 seats each, for a total of 380 seats (20 x 19 = 380). Therefore, up to 380 people can simultaneously ride in the 20 RiesenrÃ¤der.
Response:  The Riesenrad can accommodate 18 x 15 = 270 people in total. If 10 seats are broken, then 10 x 15 = 150 seats are unavailable. Therefore, only 270 - 150 = 120 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously.
Response:  There are 16 people in the Ferris wheel (given). Each seat can hold 14 people, so there are 16/14 = 1 groups of people in each seat. Since there are 6 seats in total, there are 1 x 6 = 6 groups of people in the Ferris wheel. Therefore, 6 x 14 = 84 people can be accommodated in the Ferris wheel at one time.
Response:  There are 2 small seats and each can accommodate 14 people, so there are 2 x 14 = 28 people who can ride on the small seats in total.
Response:  There are 7 large seats and each can accommodate 12 people, so there are 7 x 12 = 84 people who can ride on the big seats of the Ferris wheel.
Response: 4 people can sit in each seat of the Ferris wheel, so 4 x 16 = 64 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once.
Response:  The Riesenrad has 8 seats in total (2 x 4).
Response:  There are 14 pieces of toppings in total and each pizza has the same number of pieces. So, there are 14/7 = 2 pieces of toppings in each pizza.

Response:  There will be 17 x 4 = 68 PizzastÃ¼cke for 25 people if each pizza has 4 pieces.
Response:  If we have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 pieces, then if they are distributed equally among two people, each person will receive 45 pieces of pizza (9 x 10 = 90 / 2).
Response:  They have planted  45 x 2 = 90 Samen.
Response:  If Paige and her mother have planted 45 seeds in 9 flowerbeds together, then they have planted 5 seeds in each flowerbed (45 / 9 = 5).
"Response:  To find out how many flowerbeds they had, we need to divide the total number of seeds planted (36) by the number of seeds planted in each bed (12). This gives us:  
36 / 12 = 3 So they had 3 flowerbeds."
"Response:  To find out how many flowers were planted, we need to know how many seeds were sown and what percentage of them grew into flowers. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  
* Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds. 
* They sowed 15 seeds in each flower bed. 
* Only 60% of the seeds grew into flowers (this means that 60 out of every 100 seeds grew). Now let's use this information to calculate how many flowers were planted:  First, we can calculate how many seeds grew into flowers: 
60% of 55 = 33 (since 60/100 x 55 = 33) So, 33 seeds grew into flowers. Next, we can calculate how many flower beds were needed to accommodate all the growing seeds: 
33 / 15 = 2 (Since 33 / 15 = 2 with no remainder) Therefore, two flower beds were needed to accommodate all the growing seeds. Finally, we can calculate how many flowers were planted altogether: 
2 x 15 = 30 (Since 2 x 15 = 30 with no remainder) Thus, 30 flowers were planted altogether."
Response:  If Paige has planted 60 seeds and each beet requires 10 seeds, then she has planted 6 beets (60 / 10 = 6).
Response: 4 Samen pro Beet.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 cookies, then he had 2 x 11 = 22 cookies left for himself.
Response:  If Matthew gave 2 cookies to each of his friends, then he has given a total of 2 x 8 = 16 cookies to his friends.
Response:  Each friend has eaten 3 crackers (15 - 10 = 5 x 3).
Response:  Matthew gave 17 crackers to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends an equal amount of crackers and cake, then each friend received  22/11 = 2 crackers and  34/11 = 3 pieces of cake.
Response:  Each person has eaten 10 crackers and 10 cakes (2 x 10 = 20).
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 7 friends an equal amount of cookies and cakes, then each friend received  7/8 \* 14 = 9 cookies and  7/8 \* 21 = 16 cakes.
Response:  Each person has eaten 36/18 = 2 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew had 36 Kekse and gave each of his friends 6 Kekse, then he has given a total of 36 / 6 = 6 friends Kekse.

Response:  Matthew gave his friends 5 x 23 = 115 crackers in total.
Response:  Each person has eaten 8 crackers (32 / 4 = 8).
"Response:  If Matthew had 10 crackers and 8 cupcakes initially, and he gave each of his 4 friends the same number of crackers and cupcakes, then each friend would have eaten 2 crackers and 2 cupcakes.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Let the cost of the ball be x cents. Then, the cost of the bat is $1.00 more than the ball, so the cost of the bat is x + $1.00. Since the total cost of the bat and the ball together is $1.10, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + $1.00 = $1.10

Subtracting $1.00 from both sides gives us:

2x = $0.10

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = $0.05

So, the ball costs $0.05."
"Response:  Each person has eaten 4 crackers and 4 pieces of cake.  
Question:  If there were initially 13 crackers and 15 pieces of cake, how many crackers and pieces of cake did each person get?  Answer:  There are 28 people in total, so if we divide 13 by 28, we get approximately 0.46 (or 46%) of the crackers per person, and if we divide 15 by 28, we get approximately 0.57 (or 57%) of the cakes per person."
"Response:  To find out how many water bottles Debby bought, we need to divide the total number of days she drank water by the number of days each bottle lasted. We know that she drank 109 bottles per day and each bottle lasted for 74 days, so we can calculate as follows:  

Total number of days = Number of days x Number of bottles per day 
= 109 x 74 
= 8236 
Therefore, Debby had 8236 water bottles."
Response:  To find out how many water bottles Debby drank per day, we need to divide the total number of water bottles she bought (153) by the number of days the water bottles lasted (17). So, the calculation is:  153 / 17 = 9  Therefore, Debby drank 9 water bottles per day.
Response:  Debby has drunk 15 x 11 = 165 water bottles and she has 264 - 165 = 99 water bottles left.
Response:  Debby has drunk for 109 days (144 x 3 = 109).
Response:  The number of days that the water bottles would last is 88 / 4 = 22 days.
"Response:  The number of days that the lemonade bottles would last is equal to the total number of water bottles divided by the daily consumption of water bottles minus the daily consumption of lemonade bottles, which can be calculated as follows:  

Total Number of Water Bottles / Daily Consumption of Water Bottles - Daily Consumption of Lemonade Bottles =? 

In this case, we know that Debby has 200 water bottles and she drinks 312 water bottles per day, so the calculation becomes:  

200 / 312 - 4 = 200 / 308 = 6 days  
Therefore, the lemonade bottles would last for 6 days if Debby drank only water and lemonade at the same rate every day."
Response:  If Debby drinks 6 bottles per day and she has bought 12 water bottles in total, then she would be able to last for 2 days (12 / 6 = 2).
Response:  If Debby drinks 15 water bottles and 54 lemonade bottles every day, she consumes 15 x 365 = 5475 water bottles per year. Since there are 95 water bottles in total, this means that the water bottles would last her for approximately 5475 / 95 = 57 days.
"Response:  The number of days that the lemonade bottles would last is calculated by dividing the total number of lemonade bottles (360) by the number of lemonade bottles consumed per day (9):  

360 / 9 = 40 days

Therefore, the lemonade bottles would last for 40 days if Debby consumes 9 lemonade bottles per day."

Response:  There are 7 buses with a total of 98 students. If each bus is fully loaded, there will be 7 x 40 = 280 seats available on all buses.
"Response: 

Let x be the number of scholars in the school. Since each classroom has 36 students and there are 84 classrooms, we can write an equation as follows:

x = 36 Ã 84 = 3024

Therefore, there are 3024 scholars in the school."
"Response:  To determine how many buses will be needed for the school trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available per bus. We can do this as follows:  
Total number of students = 67 x 66 = 4322  Number of seats per bus = 6  Therefore, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:  
Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus  = 4322 / 6 = 720  So, 720 buses will be needed for the school trip."
"Response:  To determine how many buses will be needed for the school trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available per bus. Since there are 58 students and each bus has two seats, we can calculate the number of buses as follows:  
58 students / 2 seats/bus = 29 buses  Therefore, 29 buses will be needed for the school trip."
Response:  There are 24 classrooms and each has the same number of students, so there are 24 x (number of students per classroom) = 24 x 30 = 720 students in total. Since there are 120 students in the school, we can set up an equation:  720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, there are 600 students in the school.
"Response: 3 buses will be needed to transport all students who want to participate in the field trip if 22 students do not attend.  

Question: A company has 5 departments with 9 employees each. If one employee from department A is absent and another employee from department B is late, how many employees are present in the office that day?  Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: There would be 8 (9 - 1) employees present in the office from departments C, D, E, F, and G, assuming no other absences or lateness in those departments."
Response: 11 x 99 = 1099 (number of seats available) - 8 = 1091 (number of students who can participate).
"Response: 36 buses will be needed for the school trip.  
Explanation: To determine how many buses are required, we need to divide the total number of students (111) by the number of seats available per bus (3). This gives us:

111 / 3 = 37

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 36 buses."
"Response:  If there are 46 school buses and each bus can seat 92 students (since there are 92 students in the school), then the total number of seats available is:  
46 buses x 92 students/bus = 4328 seats."
Response:  If Haley gives each of the 11 boys 9 murbles, then she has 11 x 9 = 99 murbles in total.
Response:  If Haley has 10 murals and gives each of 5 boys 5 murals, then she has given a total of 5 x 5 = 25 murals to the boys.
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, then each of the 4 boys will receive (23 - 15) = 8 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who want to play with murals and Haley has 26 marbles, then each boy will receive (26/13) = 2 marbles.
Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and wants to distribute them equally among two boys in her class, each boy will receive 10 marbles.
Response:  If Haley had 28 Murmeln and gave each boy 2 Murmeln, then she would have given 28/2 = 14 boys Murmeln.
"Response:  Frank has read his favorite book for days, where each day he reads pages.  
To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:
Days = Pages / Daily Pages
= 392 / 14
= 28 days"
Response:  The book has 22 x 365 = 8070 pages.
"Response:  To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book:  
pages/day = total pages / number of days 
= 612 pages / 6 days 
= 102 pages/day"

x + y = 6... 29 more words"
"Response: 2 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. 

Question: How many apples does Adam have if he has fewer apples than Jackie? 
Answer: 1 apple less than Jackie. 

Question: How many apples do Adam and Jackie have in total? 
Answer: Together they have 7 apples."
Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know about the situation:  1. Adam and Jackie have a total of 12 apples together.  2. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. So let's use algebra to represent this information. We can say that A represents the number of apples Adam has, and J represents the number of apples Jackie has. Based on point #2 above, we know that A = J + 8. Now we need to find out how many apples they have in total. Since they have a total of 12 apples, we can set up an equation as follows: A + J = 12. Substituting A = J + 8 into this equation gives us: J + (J + 8) = 12. Combine like terms: 2J + 8 = 12. Solve for J: 2J = 4. J = 2. Now we know that Jackie has 2 apples. And since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Adam has: A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10 apples. Therefore, Adam has 10 apples, and Jackie has 2 apples.
Response:  Adam has 12 apples (4 more than Jackie + 2 shared).
"Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: 
Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie. 
Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples.  We can use this information to find out how many apples Adam has. First, let's add the number of oranges and apples that Jackie has:  89 + 11 = 100  Now, we know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, so we can calculate the number of apples Adam has by adding 5 to the total number of apples Jackie has:  100 + 5 = 105  Therefore, Adam has 105 apples."

Response:  After losing 20 kilograms, Jessie weighs 71 - 20 = 51 kilograms.
"Response:  To find out how much Jessie weighed before she started jogging, we can subtract her current weight from the amount of weight she has lost. So, if she currently weighs 27 kg and has lost 101 kg, then she must have weighed:  
Weight before jogging = Current weight - Weight lost  
= 27 kg - 101 kg  
= 74 kg Therefore, Jessie weighed 74 kilograms before she started jogging."
Response:  To find out how much Jessie weighed before she started jogging, we can use the information that she has lost 126 kilograms and now weighs 66 kilograms. We can set up an equation based on this information: Let x be the weight Jessie had before she started jogging. Then, we know that x + 126 = 66 (since she has lost 126 kg). Solving for x, we get: x = 40 (Since 40 kg + 126 kg = 66 kg) So, Jessie weighed 40 kilograms before she started jogging.
Response:  Jessie weighs 69 - 35 = 34 kilograms now.
Response:  After two weeks of daily jogging, Jessie has lost a total of 50 + 60 = 110 kilograms. Therefore, she currently weighs 114 - 110 = 4 kilograms.
"Response:  To find out how much Jessie weighed before she started jogging, we need to subtract the amount she lost each week from her current weight of 9 kilograms.  
First week: 9 kg - 62 kg = 83 kg (Jessie lost 62 kg)  Second week: 9 kg - 140 kg = 149 kg (Jessie lost 140 kg) Therefore, Jessie weighed 83 kg before she started jogging."
Response:  After one week of jogging, Jessie weighed 36 kilograms (56 - 20 = 36).

Response:  The farmer has picked 137 tomatoes and had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, so he has 105 + 71 = 176 tomatoes in total. If he has picked 137 tomatoes, then there are still 176 - 137 = 39 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  To determine how many wooden boards are needed for the wall of the house, we need to divide the total number of nails used by the number of nails required per board. In this case, there are 4 nails in total and each board requires 2 nails, so we can calculate the number of boards as follows:  4 nails / 2 nails per board = 2 boards Therefore, John needs 2 wooden boards for the wall of his house.
"Response:  To calculate how many nails John will need for the house wall, we can use the following calculation:  
13 large wooden boards x 17 nails per board = 221 nails 
Plus:  
8 nails for smaller boards = 8 nails 
Total number of nails needed = 229 nails"
"Response:  To determine how many wooden boards are needed for the wall of the house, we need to divide the total number of nails used (8) by the number of nails required per board (3). Therefore, the number of boards needed is:  8 / 3 = 2 
So, John needs two wooden boards for the wall of his house."
"Response:  To determine how many nails John will need for the house wall, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for both large and small wooden boards. Let's break down the calculation as follows:  
Large wooden boards (12 x 15 = ) = 180 nails  Small wooden boards (10 x 5 =) = 50 nails Total number of nails required = 180 + 50 = 230 nails Therefore, John will require 230 nails to build the house wall."
"Response:  To determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we need to calculate the total number of nails required based on the number of wooden boards he plans to use and the number of nails required per board.

Let's assume that each wooden board requires 2 nails for fixation.

Total number of boards = 16 (as mentioned in the problem statement)

Number of nails required per board = 2 (as mentioned in the problem statement)

Therefore, the total number of nails required can be calculated as follows:

Total number of nails = Total number of boards x Number of nails required per board
= 16 x 2
= 32

So, John will require 32 nails for the house wall."
Response:  To determine how many wooden boards John needs for the walls of his house, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for all the boards. Let's assume that each board requires 74 nails (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, the total number of nails required for all the boards can be calculated as follows: Total number of nails = Number of boards x Number of nails per board Total number of nails = 8 x 74 Total number of nails = 600 Now, since John has 600 nails, he can use them to attach 8 wooden boards to the walls of his house. So, the answer is 8.
"Response:  To determine how many wooden boards John needs for the walls of his house, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for all the large and small wooden boards combined. Let's start by calculating the number of nails required for each type of board:  
Large wooden boards (12 x 14 nails) = 168 nails Small wooden boards (17 x 25 nails) = 425 nails Total number of nails required = 168 + 425 = 693 nails Now that we have the total number of nails required, we can calculate the number of wooden boards needed based on the number of nails per board:  
For large wooden boards: 12 boards x 14 nails/board = 168 nails / 14 nails/board = 12 boards For small wooden boards: 17 boards x 25 nails/board = 425 nails / 25 nails/board = 17 boards Therefore, John will need 12 large wooden boards and 17 small wooden boards to build the walls of his house, which is a total of 39 wooden boards."

"Response:  The machine has worked for x minutes, where x is the number of hemdens it produces per minute (3) and the total number of shirts produced (6). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes

So the machine has worked for 2 minutes to produce 6 shirts."
Response:  The machine produced 4 x 5 = 20 hemdens during its 5-minute operation.
"Response:  Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of minutes the machine worked yesterday. We know that the machine produced 9 shirts in one day, so we can write an equation based on this information:  9 = x \* 3 (since the machine produces 3 shirts per minute) To solve for ""x"", we can divide both sides by 3:  9 / 3 = x x = 3 So, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday."
"Response:  The machine has worked for x minutes in total.  
We know that it produced 13 hemdens yesterday and 3 today, so the total number of hemdens is:
13 + 3 = 16

Since each hemden takes 8 minutes to produce, we can calculate the total time as follows:

16 (hemdens) x 8 (minutes/hemden) = 128 minutes

Therefore, the machine has worked for 128 minutes in total."
Response:  The machine has worked for 4 minutes today (2 hemdens/min x 4 min = 8 hemdens).
Response:  Let's say that the number of minutes the machine worked yesterday is x and today it worked for y minutes. We know that yesterday the machine produced 4 hemdens in x minutes and today it produced 8 hemdens in y minutes. So we can write an equation based on this information:  4 = x \* 1 + y \* 3 8 = x \* 1 + y \* 3 2x + 3y = 12 2x + 3y = 16 Solving for x and y, we get:  x = 4 y = 2 Therefore, the machine worked for 4 minutes yesterday (Monday) and 2 minutes today (Tuesday). In total, the machine worked for 4 + 2 = 6 minutes.
Response:  The machine has produced a total of 6 x 12 = 72 hemdens yesterday and 6 x 14 = 84 hemdens today, so it has produced a total of 72 + 84 = 156 hemdens altogether.
Response:  The machine has produced 12 - 5 = 7 hemdens today.

Question:  If it rained for 5 days during the first 20 days of the fair and they earned an average of $8 per day on those days, how much did they earn from the rain days? 
Answer:  $8 x 5 days = $40"
"Response:  To find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days of the fair, we need to divide the total amount earned during that period by the number of days:  

114 / 57 = $2.00 per day"
"Response:  She bought more packs of cookies (10) than cakes (4). So she bought 6 more packs of cookies than cakes.  
Question:  If Lucy had $50 to spend and each pack of cookies cost $3 and each pack of cake cost $2, how much money would she have left after buying both items? 
Answer:  To find out how much money Lucy would have left after buying both items, we need to calculate the total amount she spent on both items first. Let's do that:

Total amount spent on cookies = 10 x $3 = $30
Total amount spent on cakes = 4 x $2 = $8
Total amount spent = $30 + $8 = $38

Since Lucy had $50 to spend and she spent $38, she will have $50 - $38 = $12 left after buying both items."
Response:  Lucy has bought 4 + 22 + 16 = 42 packs of food.
"Response:  She bought x packs of cupcakes (since we know she bought 23 packs of cookies). Let's set up an equation to represent this information:  

Let ""x"" be the number of packs of cupcakes she purchased. 

We can start by using the information that she spent $45 in total for all her purchases. So, let's calculate how much each item cost per unit and then add it up: 

The price of one package of cookies is $2. Therefore, if she bought 23 packages of cookies, she paid: 

$2 x 23 = $46 

Since she spent $45, so she must have paid less than $46. This means that the price of one package of cupcakes cannot exceed $1. 

Now, let's use the same logic as before to find out how many packs of cupcakes she bought: 

If she paid $1 per package of cupcakes, then she would have paid: 

$1 x x = $45 

Where ""x"" represents the number of packs of cupcakes she bought. Now solve for ""x"": 

$1 x x = $45 

x = 45 / $1 

x = 45 

Therefore, she bought 45 packs of cupcakes."
Response:  To find out how many packs of food Lucy bought in total, we need to add up the number of packs of cookies and cakes she purchased. Let's start by finding out how much each item costs:   Cookies: 2 packets x $3 per packet = $6 Cakes: 12 packets x $4 per packet = $48 Now let's add up the cost of all the items Lucy bought: Total Cost = $6 + $48 = $54 Since Lucy had $56 in change after buying these items, we can set up an equation to represent this information: $56 = $54 + $2 (the amount of change) Solving for the unknown variable ($2), we get: $2 = $56 - $54 = $2 This means that Lucy spent a total of $2 on additional items or taxes. So, the total number of packs of food Lucy bought is: Total Number of Packages = $54 / $3 per package = 18 packages of cookies or cakes.
