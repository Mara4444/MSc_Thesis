Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ed had 91 mravoirs initially and lost 21 mravoirs on the game board. This means that Ed had 70 mravoirs left (91 - 21 = 70). Since Doug had 30 mravoirs less than Ed, Doug had 40 mravoirs (30 - 70 = -30). Therefore, the difference between the number of mravoirs Ed had and the number of mravoirs Doug had was 40 mravoirs."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 12 mosaics more than Doug. If Ed lost 20 of his mosaics on the game board, he would have 12 - 20 = 4 fewer mosaics than before. Therefore, Ed has 17 - 4 = 13 mosaics left. Since Doug initially had 12 mosaics less than Ed, and Ed now has 13 mosaics less, Doug must have 12 + 13 = 25 mosaics."

* Однако, Дэвид сделал на 87 скручиваний меньше, чем Захарий. (Difference = -49)

Now, let's find out how many more than or less than 38 from each of their scores:

For Dэavid: 58 - 38 = 20 (More than 38 by 20)
For Захарий: 38 + (-49) = 97 (Less than 38 by 49)

Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches made by Захарий is 49. So, Захарий did 49 more push-ups than crunches."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Zahary made 46 push-ups and 58 crunches during his physical education class today. David did 38 more push-ups than Zahary but fewer crunches, with 62 less than Zahary. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches that Zahary did is 10 (46 - 38 = 10)."
Response: 39 - 13 = 26
Response: 36
"Response: 24
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Захарий сделал 15 отжиманий на уроке физкультуры сегодня (Z).
* Дэavid сделал на 39 отжиманий больше, чем Захарий (D = Z + 39).
* John сделал на 9 отжиманий меньше, чем Дэavid (J = D - 9).

Now, we need to find out how many more or fewer from John did Захарий make than John. We can do this by subtracting John's number of push-ups from Захарий's number of push-ups:

Number of push-ups made by Захарий minus number of push-ups made by John = Number of push-ups made by Захарий minus 9
= Z - J
= 24 - 9
= 15

Therefore, Захарий made 15 more push-ups than John."
Response: 30 - 37 = -7
Response: 94 (Dave made 56 more than Zachary, and Dave did 38 push-ups alone, so together they did 38 + 56 = 94 push-ups).
"Response: 58
Explanation: According to the question, Dэavid did more than 40 push-ups but fewer than 17 less than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches, David did 58 crunches."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the question, David made 36 more push-ups than Zachari, but reduced the number of crunches by 33 compared to Zachari's fitness class today. So, if Zachari did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then he did 21 more crunches than push-ups."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, David made more than Zachari by 27 push-ups and less than him by 7 crunches during their physical education class today. If Zachari did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, then he did 10 more crunches than push-ups."

Explanation: According to the question, Pol received 52 kandandaes as a gift and gave away 52 during the school year, leaving him with 492. To find out how many he lost or gave away, we subtract the number he gave away from the total he had at first (535 - 52 = 483)."
"Response: 377 (or 378)
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Пол received 521 carandash and 66 laski for his birthday.
* At the end of the school year, he had 154 carandash left.
* He did not lose or give away any laastik.

Now, let's calculate the number of carandashes Poł had at the beginning of the school year:

521 - 66 = 455

So, during the school year, Poł lost or gave away 97 carandashes (455 - 154 = 301)."
"Response: 240
Explanation:
At first, Pol had 531 kandandaish and 38 laski. So he had a total of 569 items (531 + 38).
By the end of the year, he lost only one lazika, so he had 568 items left (569 - 1 = 568).
Therefore, Pol has 240 more candle sticks than laskis."
"Response: 265
Explanation:
At first, Pol had 601 karandashes and 406 laskis. So he had a total of 1007 items.
By the end of the school year, he lost 336 laaskis but gained no karandashes, so he had 669 (1007 - 336) karandashes left.
Since he had more karandashes than laskis at the start of the school year, he must have had more laskis than karandashes at the end of the school year. Therefore, the number of laskis he had at the end of the school year is 669 - 406 = 265."
"Response: 29
Explanation: According to the passage, Pol received 315 koh-i-noors at the beginning of the year and lost or gave away 315 by the end of the year. This means that he had 29 left (315 - 315 = 0). Therefore, he received 29 koh-i-noors on his birthday."
"Response: 77
Explanation: According to the question, Pol received 267 kandandaes as gift and lost 231 during the school year. This means he has 34 (267 - 231) kandandaes left. He gave away 308 kandandaes to his friends, which is more than the number of kandandaes he lost. Therefore, the difference between the number of kandandaes he gave away and the number he lost is equal to 77 kandandaes."
"Response: 198
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* At the beginning of the year, Pol had 457 laces and 320 pencils.
* By the end of the year, he had only 523 items left (not including any lost).
* He did not lose any laces or pencils during the year.

From these statements, we can deduce that Pol gained some items during the year. Let's call the number of additional items ""x"".

We know that the total number of laces at the start of the year was 457 + x, and the total number of pencils was 320 + x.

At the end of the year, Pol had 523 items left, which means that the sum of all his laces and pencils is equal to 523. So, we can write the equation:

457 + x = 523

Now, let's solve for ""x"":

x = 198

Therefore, there were 198 additional pencils and laces that Pol received during the year, beyond what he already had at the beginning of the year."

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, STEVEN has 17 persecs and 16 jablos. If Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve, then Jake must have x persimmons. Since Steve has more apples than Jake, Steve must have y apples. We are told that Jake has 6 less persimmons than Steve, so Jake has x - 6 = 10 persimmons. And we are also told that Steve has 8 more apples than Jake, so Steve has y + 8 = 24 apples. Therefore, the difference between the number of persimmons and apples is 24 - (10 - 6) = 18.

Football shirts: 157 x $192 = $28,644
T-shirts: 19 x $34 = $656
Total revenue: $28,644 + $656 = $30,290
Therefore, the difference between the price of a football shirt and a t-shirt is:
$30,290 - $656 = $29,634

"Response: 690 dollars. 
Explanation: To find out how much money they earned from selling footballs during the game, we need to multiply the number of footballs sold by the original price per football. Since they sold 130 footballs at $51 each, the total amount of money earned is:

130 x $51 = $6,430

Then, we subtract the discount amount ($8 x 130) from the total amount of money earned:

$6,430 - $1,040 = $5,390

Therefore, the magazin Razorback earned $5,390 from selling footballs during the game."

"Response: 56 dollars
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the total revenue from football jerseys is $240 x 23 = $5,380 and the total revenue from t-shirts is $210 x 177 = $36,970. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a football jersey and a t-shirt is $36,970 - $5,380 = $31,590. So, the cost of a football jersey is $31,590 / 23 = $1,360 more than the cost of a t-shirt."
"Response: 40 dollars more. 
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the price of each football shirt is $115 and the price of each t-shirt is $25. Therefore, if we subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a football shirt, we get $90 (football shirt - t-shirt). Since they sold 78 football shirts and 113 t-shirts during the game, the total revenue from football shirts is $78 x $90 = $6,920, while the total revenue from t-shirts is $113 x $25 = $2,825. So, the difference between the revenue from football shirts and t-shirts is $6,920 - $2,825 = $4,095. This means that a football shirt costs $4095 / $25 = $163 more than a t-shirt."

"Response: 968400 dollars
Explanation: To calculate the total amount of money Lewis will earn over 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks he will work in each season. Since there are 223 weeks in a harvest season, and Lewis works for 73 seasons, the total number of weeks he will work is:

223 weeks/season x 73 seasons = 16,091 weeks

Now, we can multiply Lewis's weekly salary by the number of weeks he will work to get the total amount of money he will earn:

$1357/week x 16,091 weeks = $968,400
Therefore, Lewis will earn $968,400 over 73 harvest seasons."

Response: 36 feet (10 times the height of Dino plus 9 feet)
"Response: 20 feet (6 meters)
Explanation: According to the question, the depth of water is twice Din's height, which means it is 2 times 8 = 16 feet. Since Ron is 14 feet above the water level, the water level must be 16 - 14 = 20 feet deep."
Response: 30 feet (4 times Ron's height)
Response: 20 feet (15 x 4 = 60 + 13 = 73)
Response: 20 feet (457 cm)
"Response: 45 feet (or 13.7 meters)
Explanation: According to the passage, ""глубина воды в 9 раз больше роста Дина."" This means that if Ron's height is 15 feet (which is equal to 4.5 meters), then Dino's height is 6 times smaller than Ron's height, or 9 times smaller than 15 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 times 15 feet, which equals 135 feet (or 40.5 meters). However, since we are asked for the gleneba of the water in feet, we will round up to 45 feet (or 13.7 meters)."

"Response: 30
Explanation: Carol bought 7 packs of invitations, each containing 10 invitations. If she sends only 2 friends an invitation (which is the minimum number allowed), then she will have used up all 7 packs or 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Therefore, there will be 30 invitations left over."
Response: 98 friends (14 x 6 = 84 + 11 = 98)
"Response: 4 (rounded up from 3.75)
Explanation: To determine how many additional invitations Carol needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of invitations she can afford with the two packs she has bought. Each pack contains 3 invitations, so the total number of invitations in each pack is 6 (3 x 2). Since Carol wants to invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional invitations equal to the difference between the total number of invitations in the two packs and the number of friends she wants to invite. Therefore, the number of additional invitations Carol needs to buy is:

Total number of invitations in two packs = 6 x 2 = 12
Number of friends Carol wants to invite = 9
Additional invitations needed = 12 - 9 = 3
Therefore, Carol needs to buy 4 additional invitations."

Let's count the number of rows and columns in each row to find out how many total pieces of chalk Fey has:

* Each row has 22 chalk pieces, so there are 22 x 6 = 132 chalk pieces in all six rows.
* Since each column contains 14 chalk pieces, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of columns per row to get the total number of chalk pieces: 132 x 14 = 1808.
Therefore, Fey has 1808 chalk pieces in total."
"Response: 6 rows.

Response: 14 (number of seats in each bus) x 7 buses = 98 students.
Response: 84 x 118 = 9624 students in school.
"Response: 4 buses.
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for an excursion, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. In this case, there are 67 classes in the school with 66 students per class, so the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4282 students. Since each bus can hold 6 people, we need 4282 / 6 = 4282/6 = 713 buses. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number and get 4 buses."
"Response: 43
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has an equal number of students (x). Since there are 87 classes in total, we can write x = 87. Now, since there are 58 students in total and each bus can accommodate 2 students, we have 58 / 2 = 29 students per bus. Therefore, the number of buses required is 29 / 2 = 14. So, 14 buses are needed for the excursion."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 24 classes in the school.
* In each class, there are an equal number of students.
* The total number of students in the school is 120.
* Each bus has 84 seats.

Now, let's calculate the number of students in each class:

Number of students per class = Total number of students / Number of classes
= 120 / 24
= 5

So, there are 5 students in each class."

Response: 5 mraimors each.
Response: 3 mraimoes per boy.
"Response: 10 шариков.
Explanation: Since there are two boys in total, and Haley has 20 glass balls to distribute equally among them, each boy will receive 10 glass balls from Haley."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave each of the boys 2 marbles each, and she had 28 marbles in total. Therefore, if there were 10 boys, they would have received 2 marbles each, for a total of 20 marbles given out. However, since the question states that some of the boys liked playing with marbles, it is possible that not all 10 boys received marbles, so the actual number of boys who received marbles is less than 10."
Response: 27 days
Response: 1048 pages (or 22 pages per day x 569 days)
Response: 25 pages per day (612 / 6 = 25)
"Response: 10 pages per chapter (or 5 pages per half-chapter)
Explanation: According to the question, Fank took 220 days to read his favorite book, which has 555 pages in total. If each chapter contains an equal number of pages, then we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:
Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of pages in each chapter
= 555 / 10
= 55 chapters
Since there are 5 chapters in each half-book, we can divide the total number of pages by 5 to get the number of pages in each half-chapter:
Number of pages in each half-chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 / 55
= 10 pages
Therefore, each chapter in Frank's favorite book contains approximately 10 pages."
"Response: 4.25 (rounded to one decimal place)
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Fank read his favorite book for 660 days and there were 15 chapters in the book. Therefore, he read one chapter per day. Since there are 193 pages in the book, Frank read approximately 4.25 pages per day (193 / 15 = 4.25)."
Response: 86 pages per day (249 pages / 3 days)
"Response: 7 books.
Explanation: According to the question, Fank took 12 days to read each book, which means he spent 12 x 7 = 84 days reading all seven books. Since it took him 492 days to finish all the books, that means he finished reading the first seven books in 492 - 84 = 408 days."
Response: 112/16 = 7 pages per day
"Response: 70 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank read 8 pages per day, which means he covered a total of 8 x 576 = 4512 pages in one day. Therefore, it will take him 4512 / 8 = 563 days to finish reading the entire book if he continues at this pace. However, since we are asked how many days it took him to finish the book, we need to subtract the number of days he had already spent reading the book (which is not given in the question) from the total number of days required to finish the book. So, the answer is 70 days."
Response: 450/30 = 15 pages per day
"Response: 1988 pages (or 3976 pages)
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that there are three chapters in Frank's favorite book and each chapter contains 594 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages
= 3 x 594 = 1772 pages
Since it took Frank 607 days to finish reading the book, the number of pages he read per day can be calculated as follows:
Total number of pages / Number of days taken = Number of pages read per day
= 1772 pages / 607 days = 29 pages per day
Therefore, the answer to the question is 1988 pages (or 3976 pages)."
"Response: 1.33 (or approximately 1 day and 19 hours)
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Fank took 664 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, there are 405 / 664 = 0.61 chapters per day. Therefore, Frank read approximately 1.33 chapters per day."

"Response: 12
Explanation: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. If each DVD pack costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 for each pack, then the cost of one pack after applying the discount is:

$107 - ($106 x number of packs) = $107 - ($106 x x)
where x is the number of packs you want to buy.
We are given that the total cost of buying x packs is $93. So we can set up an equation:

$107 - ($106 x x) = $93
Solving for x, we get:
x = 12
Therefore, you can buy 12 packs of DVDs at a cost of $93."
Response: 51 dollars. 
"Response: 4

"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Brandy's mother made 22 pieces of gingerbread for 5 people. If each person had an equal amount of gingerbread, then there were 22 / 5 = 4.4 peaces of gingerbread per person. Since 17 pieces of gingerbread were thrown away, that means each person got 4.4 - 17 = 30 pieces of gingerbread."

* Frank had 33 candies initially.
* He lost 24 of them. So, he has 33 - 24 = 9 candies left.
* If he puts these remaining candies in packets of 9 each, then he will have 9 / 9 = 1 packet.

Therefore, there is one packet of candies left with Frank, which means that the answer is 1/4."

Response: 40 (the difference between the number of bottles and apples).
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the question, there are 36 jablocks and 80 bottles of ordinary soda water. Therefore, the total number of bottles is 80 + 36 = 116. Since there are only 54 bottles of dietary soda water, the difference between the total number of bottles and the number of dietary soda water is 116 - 54 = 62. So, there are 62 more bottles than jablocks in the product store."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, there were only 30 total bottles of gas in the store, and 28 of them were regular soda bottles. Therefore, there could only be 2 diet soda bottles left, which is the correct answer."
"Response: 310
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of bottles of dietary soda is x. Since there are 79 more ordinary soda than dietary soda, the number of bottles of ordinary soda is x + 79. Therefore, the total number of bottles in the store is x + (x + 79) = 2x + 79. So, the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 2x. Thus, the number of bottles of dietary soda is x - 2x = -1. Therefore, there were 310 bottles of ordinary soda in the store."

317 - 295 = 22."
"Response: 1897
Explanation: According to Racheal's statement, there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the previous day and 246 visitors in total during that period of time. Therefore, if we divide the number of visitors by the number of days (25), we get 703 / 25 = 28.28. Since this is not an integer value, rounding it up gives us 29 visitors per day. So, over the course of 25 days, there would be 29 x 25 = 725 visitors to Buckingham Palace."
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the previous day and after they had their heavy meal, Rachel found out that 100 more visitors came to the palace in that day than in the previous day. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors in those two days is 666 - 100 = 566. So, there were 566 more visitors to Buckingham Palace in the second day than in the first day."
"Response: 132
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, during the last 327 days, Buckingham Palace has received 406 visitors. Therefore, if they visited the palace on the day of their meal (which is not specified), then the number of visitors that day would be 132 (the difference between the total number of visitors and the number of visitors during the previous 327 days)."
Response: 371 visitors.

* In the previous day, there were 191 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* The day before that (i.e., 2 days ago), there were 457 visitors.
* Today, there are 705 visitors.

To find out how many more visitors came today than on the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the second-to-last day from the number of visitors today:

705 - 457 = 248

So, 248 more visitors came to Buckingham Palace today than during the previous 245 days."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if it takes 6 days to fill 90 barrels of wine, then they will be filling 15 barrels per day (90 / 6 = 15)."
Response: 54 бочки (per day)
"Response: 38520
Explanation: To find out how many barrels of wine will be filled during the period of 146 days, we need to multiply the number of collectors by the number of days and then divide it by the capacity of one barrel. Accordingly:
Number of collectors x Number of days = 294 x 146 = 43520
Divide this result by the capacity of one barrel (244 barrels) gives us the final answer - 38520 barrels of wine that will be filled during the specified period."
Response: 16489 bocks of wine will be collected in 77 days.
"Response: 6344
Explanation:
The given information can be represented in a table as follows:
Day | Number of collections | Amount of wine filled per collection (in bottles)
---|-----------------------|-----------------------------
1 | 252 | 108
2 | 252 | 108
3 | 252 | 108
... |... |...
57 | 252 | 108
Total number of days = 58
Therefore, the total amount of wine filled in bottles over 58 days is:
Total amount = Number of collections x Amount of wine filled per collection
= 252 x 108
= 27,920
Dividing this by 58 gives us the daily average:
Average amount = Total amount / Number of days
= 27,920 / 58
= 480
Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us the final answer:
Final answer = Round(480)
= 6344
Therefore, after 58 days, the total amount of wine filled in bottles would be 6344."

"Response: 57
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* In the zoo enclosure, there were 93 snakes and 97 alligators.
* 40 of the alligators are hiding.

So, the number of alligators that are not hiding is:
97 - 40 = 57
Therefore, 57 alligators are not hiding in the enclosure."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were initially 75 alligators and 3 snakes in the zoo enclosure. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators hide, then 40 alligators do not hide (i.e., they are left outside)."
"Response: 30 (3 x 10)
Explanation: The total number of animals in the cage is given as 79. If 24 zmeies and 51 alligators are hiding, then there are 79 - 74 = 5 animals that are not hiding. Since each animal can be either a snake or an alligator, there must be 3 snakes and 2 alligators that are not hiding, for a total of 3 + 2 = 5 non-hiding animals."

"Response: 2 doasks
Explanation: According to the question, John will need 4 nails (gvozdy) for each big board he uses to attach the boards to the wall of his house. Since there are 2 big boards required per wall, John will need 8 nails in total to attach both boards to the wall."
"Response: 25 gvozdy (gvozdy is the Russian word for nails).
Explanation: To determine how many nails John needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for all the big and small docks. The big docks require 13 x 17 = 221 nails, while the smaller docks require 8 x 8 = 64 nails. Therefore, in total, John needs 221 + 64 = 285 nails."
"Response: 4 doasks
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, John used 11 nails (or gvozdy) to secure big wooden boards for his house's walls. If each board requires 3 nails for installation, then John used 3 x 11 = 33 nails in total. Since there are 4 big wooden boards mentioned in the question, John needs 33 / 4 = 8 doaks (or boards) for the wall of his house. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 doaks."
Response: 25 gvozdy (gvozdy is the Russian word for nails or spikes).
Response: 32 gvozdy (gvozdy is the Russian word for nails or screws)
"Response: 590 gvozdiy (gvozdy)
Explanation: To calculate the number of gvozdy needed for John to secure the walls of his house with 8 large wooden boards, we need to multiply the number of boards by the amount of gvozdy required for each board. Since each board requires 74 gvozdy, and there are 8 boards in total, the total number of gvozdy needed is: 8 x 74 = 590 gvozdy."

Solution: The solution is 20 minutes.
To calculate this, you can use the following formula: Total time = Number of ruubashes produced / Number of ruubashes per minute x Time taken to produce one ruubashi.
In this case, the number of ruubashes produced is 16 (13 + 3), and the number of ruubashes per minute is 8 (as stated in the problem). Therefore, the total time the machine worked is:
Total time = 16/8 x 60 = 20 minutes."

"Response: 5 upacks (torte)
Explanation: According to the question, Lucy bought several packages of cake and some packages of pie. The total number of packages she bought was 27. Since each package contains either cake or pie, but not both, we can conclude that Lucy bought at least as many packages of cake as she did of pie. Therefore, the number of packages of cake Lucy bought is equal to the number of packages of pie she bought minus 1, which is 5."

"Response: 48 feet (or 14.6 meters)
Explanation: According to the question, if the depth of the cave is 919 feet and they need to travel 1307 feet, then the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave is 1307 - 919 = 388 feet or 118 meters. Since there are 12 feet in a foot, we can convert this distance to feet by dividing by 12: 388 / 12 = 32 feet or 9.75 meters. Therefore, the end of the cave is located 32 feet or 9.75 meters away from the entrance."
