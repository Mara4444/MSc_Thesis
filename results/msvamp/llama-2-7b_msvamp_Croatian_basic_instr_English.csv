Explanation:  From the question, we know that there are 4 red berries in each of the two baskets and a total of 12 berries in both baskets combined. Since there are some green berries in addition to the red ones, let's assume that there are x green berries in each basket. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of red berries = 4
Number of green berries = x
Total number of berries = Number of red berries + Number of green berries
= 4 + x

Since there are 12 berries in total, we can set up the following equation:

4 + x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 green berries in each basket."

Explanation:
Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books in his room initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the collection. Therefore, there are a total of 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf now. Since each book represents one knife, we can conclude that for every 2 action figures, there is one book. So, the number of books on the shelf is 6 / 2 = 3. Hence, there are 3 books on the shelf more than the number of action figures."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the passage, Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf before adding more. The passage states that he added ""three new ones"" and then removed 10 old ones. Therefore, the total number of action figures on the shelf after Jerry added three new ones is 7 + 3 = 10."

If he received 7 emails in the morning and ""još nekoliko"" (meaning ""and several more"") in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 + X emails in the afternoon, where X is the number of additional emails he received. Since X is not explicitly stated, we can assume that it is equal to 2, since the question mentions that Jack received ""nekoliko"" (meaning ""several"") additional emails in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is 7 + 2 = 9."

"Response: 4

Explanation: According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 6 at 6 pm. Therefore, he received a total of 9 emails during the day (morning + evening). Since the question also states that he received ""još neke"" emails that night, we can assume that he received an additional email or more after 6 pm. So, the total number of emails Jack received is 9 + however many emails he received after 6 pm = 9 + x, where x is a positive integer."

Response: 46 in (31 + 35)
"Response: 40 inch
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the frog (žaba) is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the snake (štakor) and the mouse (miš). The snake skočio 36 inča, and the mouse skočio 15 inča dalje od skakavaca. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the frog is: 36 + 15 = 51 inch."
"Response: 3 inch

Response: 40 in (inches)
Response: 45 in (inches)
"Response: 16 inch
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the mouse is 26 inches less than the distance traveled by the frog. Since the frog traveled 32 inches beyond the starting point, the mouse must have traveled 32 - 26 = 8 inches."
"Response: 10 inch
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the frog (žaba) is 33 inches more than the distance traveled by the snake (štakor). Therefore, if the snake skočio 24 inches, then the frog must have skočila 33 + 24 = 57 inches more than the snake. Since the mouse (miš) skočio 5 inches less than the frog, the distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is 57 - 5 = 52 inches."
Response:  Žaba je skočila 20 inča (20 cm).
Response: 45 inches (35 + 10) = 45 inches
"Response: 40 cm
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance that the frog jumped is equal to the sum of the distances that the snake and mouse jumped. The snake jumped 30 cm, and the mouse jumped 20 cm less than the frog. Therefore, the total distance that the frog jumped is:

30 cm + (20 cm - 10 cm) = 40 cm
So, the frog jumped 40 cm."
"Response: 40 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, stork skočio 39 inča and then skočio 19 inča dalje od žabe. This means that stork skočio a total of 58 inča (39 + 19). Then, we are told that miš has skočio 12 inča manje od žabe. Therefore, if the distance between stork and miš is 58 inča, and miš has skočio 12 inča less than that, then miš must have skočio 46 inča (58 - 12 = 46)."
"Response: 39 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the stork skocheed 25 inches beyond the frog and the mouse skocheed 16 inches less than the frog. So, if the frog skocheed x inches, then the stork skocheed x + 25 inches and the mouse skocheed x - 16 inches. Therefore, the distance between the stork and the mouse is 39 inches (x + 25) - (x - 16)."
Response: 22 inch (39 - 17)
"Response: 5 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

* The stork jumped 9 inches (which is equal to 23 cm)
* The mouse jumped less than 10 cm less than the frog who jumped 20 cm more than the jumper

So, if the frog jumped 20 cm more than the jumper, and the jumper jumped 9 inches, then the frog jumped 20 + 9 = 29 cm.
Since the mouse jumped less than the frog, it means that the mouse jumped 29 - x cm, where x is the distance the mouse jumped. Therefore, the mouse jumped 5 inches or 13 cm."
"Response: 20 inch
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the frog (žaba) is 37 inches. The mouse (miš) skočio 16 inches less than the frog's distance. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is 37 - 16 = 21 inches."

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Zima je skoro ovdje"" (Winter is almost here), indicating that winter has already arrived in the area where the birds are living. The passage also mentions that ""većina životinja se seli u toplije zemlje"" (Most animals migrate to warmer lands). Therefore, it can be inferred that most of the bird families have already migrated to warmer areas for the winter.

According to the information provided in the passage, there are 19 bird families living near the mountain. If 60 bird families have migrated away from the mountain for the winter, and only 19 families are left behind, then the number of bird families that remained at the mountain is 60 - 19 = 41.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 41."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the passage, ""Zima je skoro ovdje"" (Winter is almost here), and ""većina životinja se seljava u toplije zemlje"" (Most animals migrate to warmer lands). This implies that many birds have already left for their wintering grounds. The passage also states that 87 bird families live near the mountain. Therefore, if 7 bird families have already gone on migration, then the number of bird families remaining behind would be 87 - 7 = 80."

"Response: 108 ptičjih obitelji

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Zima je skoro ovdje"" (Zima is almost here), indicating that winter is approaching. The majority of animals migrate to warmer climates during this time. Additionally, it is mentioned that 85 bird families live near the mountain. If 23 bird families have migrated to Africa and 37 bird families have migrated to Asia, then there are 108 bird families remaining near the mountain."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the passage, 42 bird families have migrated to Africa and 31 bird families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa and the number of bird families that have migrated to Asia is 42 - 31 = 6."
"Response: 57

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Zima je skoro ovdje"" (Zima is almost here), indicating that winter is approaching. This means that many animals are migrating to warmer climates. The passage also mentions that 38 bird families live near a mountain and that 47 bird families have already migrated to Africa. Finally, it says that 94 bird families are planning to migrate to Asia. To find out how many more bird families have migrated to Asia than to Africa, we need to subtract the number of families that have migrated to Africa from the total number of families that are planning to migrate to Asia. Therefore, the answer is 57."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the passage, almost all animals migrate south for the winter and most birds move to warmer climates. If 38 bird families went to Africa and 80 bird families went to Asia, that means there are 38 + 80 = 118 bird families that did not go on migration. Since the passage states that almost all animals migrate south for the winter, it can be inferred that the remaining 26 bird families stayed in their original location during the winter months."
Response: 36 families of birds live near the mountain. If 18 new bird families join them, then there are now 54 families of birds living near the mountain.
"Response: 37

Explanation: According to the passage, 49 families of birds live near the mountain and 59 bird families have migrated for winter. This means that 10 (59 - 49) families of birds are still near the mountain after migration. Therefore, there are 37 remaining bird families near the mountain."
"Response: 54

Explanation:
According to the passage, ""Zima je skoro ovdje"" which means Winter is almost here and most animals migrate to warmer lands. Then it states that 27 bird families have already left for winter from near the mountain. If there were initially 41 bird families living near the mountain, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain would be 41 - 27 = 14."
"Response: 120
Explanation: According to the passage, ""86 ptičkih obitelji je odletjelo na zimu iz blizine planine."" This means that 86 bird families left their wintering grounds near the mountain. The passage does not provide information about how many bird families remained in the area. Therefore, we can assume that there were 45 bird families remaining in the area (the number provided in the question). To find out how many more bird families went on migration than stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of birds that stayed from the total number of birds that migrated: 120 = 86 - 45."
Response: 20 more families of birds have migrated to Africa than have migrated to Asia.
"Response: 30

Explanation:
According to the passage, ""Tri ptičje obitelji žive blizu planine."" This means that there are three bird families living near the mountain. Then, it is stated that ""26 novih ptičjih obitelji"" have come from the Arctic to live near the mountain, which brings the total number of bird families living near the mountain to 59 (3 + 26). Finally, it is mentioned that two bird families have flown south for the winter, leaving only 57 bird families near the mountain (59 - 2). Therefore, the answer to the question is 57."

Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 571 pencils during the school year and lost 161 pencils. Therefore, he gave more pencils to his friends than he lost. The difference between the number of pencils given away and the number lost is 571 - 161 = 30."
"Response: 358
Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, Paul gave away 90 olive branches to his friends during the school year and lost 412 olive branches. Therefore, he has lost 358 more olive branches than he gave away (412 - 90 = 358)."
"Response: 411
Explanation:
According to the question, Paul gave away 563 pencils during the school year and lost 558 of them. This means that he has 332 pencils left (563 - 558 = 332). Since he received 411 pencils for his birthday, we can conclude that he received more pencils than he had left (411 > 332), so the answer is 411."

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 315 pencils at the start of the school year and lost or gave away 315 of them by the end of the year.

"Response: 198
Explanation:
According to the problem statement, Paul received 457 gums and had 523 at the end of the school year without losing any. This means that he gained 66 gums (457 - 523 = 66).
Since he also received 320 oak leaves, we can calculate the number of oak leaves he had at the beginning of the school year by subtracting the number of gums he had at the beginning from the total number of gums he received:
320 - 66 = 254
Therefore, Paul had 254 oak leaves at the beginning of the school year and 254 + 66 = 320 oak leaves at the end of the school year."

"Response: 23

Explanation:
According to the question, Paul had 2 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling those books, he bought 150 new ones, which brings his total number of books to 58 (including both the initial 2 and the newly purchased 150). Therefore, the number of books that Paul sold is 23 (initially he had 2 books + 23 books he sold = 25 books)."
"Response: 39

Explanation:
According to the question, Paul sold some of his books at a garage sale and then bought 42 new ones. If he had 21 books initially, that means he sold 42 - 21 = 21 books.

"Response: 49

Explanation:

"Response:  There are 21 books in the series ""Ludak, glup, škola"". If you have read 13 books and still need to read 8 more, then there are 8 remaining books in the series."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
If you have read 12 books in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"" and watched 56 movies from the same series, then to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of movies you have watched from the total number of books in the series. In this case, that would be:

Total number of books in the series = 22
Number of movies watched = 56
Difference = Total number of books - Number of movies watched
= 22 - 56
= -34
So, you need to read an additional 34 books to complete the series."

Explanation:
The given information can be represented in a table as follows:

| Book Series | Number of Books Read | Number of Movies Watched |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ludi k, glupa škola | 7 | 21 |

To find out how many more movies were watched than books read, we need to subtract the number of books read from the number of movies watched. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of movies watched - Number of books read = 21 - 7 = 14
So, you have watched 14 more movies than books read."
"Response: 9 books

Explanation:
The given information states that there are 8 books in the series ""Ludak, glup, škola"" and the asker wants to know how many more books they need to read. Therefore, the answer is 9 books (the total number of books in the series minus the number of books already read)."

Response: 5 films.
"Response: 7

Explanation:
The series ""Ludak, glupa škola"" has 15 books and 14 movies. If you have read 11 books and watched 40 movies, then you have more movies than books in the series. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies and books is 3 (40 - 11 = 29). Since there are 15 books in the series, the number of movies exceeds the number of books by 7 (29 - 15 = 7)."
"Response: 50 films are more than 13 books in the series ""Ludak, Glupa Škola"". Therefore, there are 50 - 13 = 37 more films than books in the series."
"Response: 4

Explanation:
The question states that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"". If we have read 14 films and watched 19 books, then we have read more books than films. Therefore, the difference between the number of books read and films watched is 5 (19 - 14 = 5)."
Response:  You have watched more movies than books. Specifically, you have watched 19 movies and read 16 books, so you have watched 3 more movies than books.

"Response: 56 dollars
Explanation: According to the passage, the price of each shirt is $24, and the price of each dress is $210. Therefore, if they sold 23 dresses during the game, their total revenue from dress sales would be $23 x $210 = $5,130. Additionally, they sold 177 t-shirts at $24 per unit, resulting in total revenue of $24 x 177 = $4,388. So, the difference between the total revenue from t-shirt sales and the total revenue from dress sales is $5,130 - $4,388 = $742. Since the number of t-shirts sold is greater than the number of dresses sold, the answer is $742."
"Response:  $25
Explanation: According to the passage, each t-shirt costs $25 and each dress costs $115. Since they sold 113 shirts and 78 dresses during the game, the total revenue from shirts is $25 x 113 = $2825, and the total revenue from dresses is $115 x 78 = $9070. Therefore, the difference between the revenue from shirts and dresses is $2825 - $9070 = -$6245."

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the passage, Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total, and they put 12 seeds in each flower bed. Since only 58 seeds germinated into flowers, that means there were 4 flower beds (58 / 12 = 4). Therefore, Paige and her mother had 4 flower beds with cvijeće."
"Response: 55/3 = 18

Explanation:
Paige helped her mother plant 55 seeds and together they sowed 15 seeds in each flower bed. Since only 60 seeds germinated into flowers in each flower bed, the total number of flowers that grew is 18 (60 / 3)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of the 6 flower beds. Therefore, they planted a total of 60 seeds (10 x 6 = 60). Since they had 30 flower beds, they must have had 30 flower pots with at least one seedling in each pot."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If they planted 32 seeds in total and divided them equally among 8 flower beds, then each flower bed would have received 4 seeds (32 / 8 = 4)."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 creamers, so he had 2 x 11 = 22 creamers in total."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 8 creepers and gave 2 creepers to each of his friends. Therefore, he has given a total of 2 x 8 = 16 creepers to his friends. So, he has 8 - 16 = -8 creepers left with himself."
Response:  Each of Matthew's five friends received 3 creamers (since there are 3 x 5 = 15 creamers in total). Therefore, each friend had 3 creamers / 5 friends = 0.6 creamers per friend.
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 24 creepers and gave some of them to his three friends. If he gave an equal number of creepers to each friend (which is what the question implies), then he would have given away 24 / 3 = 8 creepers to each friend. Therefore, Matthew now has 24 - 8 = 16 creepers left."
Response:  Each of Matthew's 11 friends received an equal number of crackers and cookies, so they each got 22/11 = 19 crackers and 34/11 = 30 cookies.
Response:  Each of Matthew's friends received an equal number of cookies and crackers as they had fingers to count them with. So, if Matthew gave away 30 crackers and 29 cookies, then each friend received 30/5 = 6 crackers and 29/5 = 5 cookies.
Response:  Each of Matthew's 7 friends received an equal number of creamers and cookies, so they each got 3 creamers and 5 cookies. Therefore, the total number of creamers and cookies shared among all 8 people is: 3 x 7 = 21 creamers and 5 x 7 = 35 cookies.
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Matthew has 36 creamers and he shared them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would get 2 creamers (36/18 = 2)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave away 6 creepers to each of his 4 friends. Therefore, he had 4 x 6 = 24 creepers in total."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 23 creepers and gave an equal number of creepers to his friends after that. Therefore, each friend received 4 creepers."
Response: 7
Response:  Each of Matthew's friends received an equal number of crackers and cookies. Therefore, if Matthew had 32 crackers to begin with, each friend would have received 32/5 = 6 crackers. Similarly, if he had 98 cookies to begin with, each friend would have received 98/5 = 19.6 cookies. Since we cannot have fractional cookies, round up to 20 cookies per friend.
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the problem, Matthew had 10 creepers and 8 cookies with his 4 friends. If each friend ate an equal number of creepers and cookies, then each friend ate 2 creepers and 2 cookies. Therefore, there are 2 cookies left over."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the problem, Matthew shared an equal number of crackers and cookies with his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cookies in the beginning, then each friend would have received 1/28 = 0.0714 (approximately 7 crackers or 9 cookies). Therefore, 4 people would have eaten at least one cracker or cookie."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Faye has placed 6 olovaka in two rows. Since she has placed an equal number of olovaka in each row, there are 3 olovaka in each row. Therefore, the total number of olovaka that Faye has placed is 3 x 3 = 9."
Response:  Faye could make 15 rows of olive branches.
"Response: 420
Explanation:  To find out how many olovka Faye has, we need to count the number of olovka in each row and then multiply it by the number of rows she had. Since there were 31 packs of olovaka, each with 6 olovaka, the total number of olovaka is:

Number of olovaka = Number of rows x Number of olovaka per row
= 19 x 31
= 420
Therefore, Faye has 420 olovaka."

"Response: 6720
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The school has 84 classrooms.
* Each classroom can accommodate 30 students (based on the average class size).
* Therefore, the total number of students in the school is: 84 x 30 = 2520 students.

However, we are also told that there are 95 school buses with 118 seats each. This means that the total number of students who will be going on the field trip is: 95 x 118 = 11,270 students.

So, the final answer to the question is: 2520 + 11,270 = 13,790 students."
"Response: 1.
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 67 classrooms and each classroom has 66 students, so the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4252. Since each school bus can accommodate 6 passengers, we need 4252 / 6 = 709 school buses to transport all the students for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 1."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 87 classrooms and 58 students in each grade level, which means that there will be 87 x 58 = 4960 students attending the school. Since each student needs two seats on the bus (one for themselves and one for their backpack), we need at least 4960 / 2 = 2480 buses to transport all the students. Therefore, the school should send four buses for this trip."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, there are 120 / 6 = 20 classes in the school. Since each bus can accommodate 84 students, there are 84 / 20 = 4.2 students per bus. So, there are 4.2 x 20 = 84 students in each class."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 102 students in total and 8 seats per bus, then the maximum number of buses needed is:

102 / 8 = 13

So, if 22 students do not want to go on the trip, the number of buses needed would be:

13 - 22 = 4"
Response: 46 students will go on the trip. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 102 classrooms and 11 students in each classroom. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 102 x 11 = 1122 students. If 8 students do not want to go on the trip, that means 1122 - 8 = 1034 students will go on the trip.
Response: 4 buses. Explanation: If there are 72 classrooms and each classroom has 3 seats in the school bus, then the total number of seats available for the field trip is 72 x 3 = 216. Since there are 111 students in total, we need to divide the total number of seats by the number of students to find out how many buses are needed. Therefore, 216 / 111 = 4 buses.
"Response: 46
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students. Since each bus can seat a maximum of 17 students (as mentioned in the question), we can conclude that all 46 buses are full, which means that there are 46 x 17 = 782 seats available for students."

"Response: 104857

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Frank read his favorite book for 22 pages per day.
To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we need to divide the number of pages he read by the number of pages in the book.
Let's assume that the book has x pages. Then, we have:
x = 22 × 569 = 104857
So, there are 104857 pages in the book."

"Response: 10 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank read 8 pages of his favorite book every day. Therefore, it will take him 10 days (8 x 10 = 80 pages) to finish reading the entire book if he continues at the same pace."
"Response: 2750
Explanation:
Frank has finished reading his favorite book in 30 days, which means he read 30/365 = 0.82 pages per day on average. Since each chapter has 450 pages and there are 41 chapters in total, Frank has read 41 x 450 = 18,100 pages in total. Therefore, he read 18,100 / 0.82 = 22,300 pages per month, or 2750 pages per week."
Response: 1280 pages (or 3 x 594)
"Response: 37
Explanation:
The book had 2 chapters, each with 405 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is 810 (2 x 405). Since it took Frank 664 days to finish reading the book, he read an average of 810/664 = 37 pages per day."

Response:  The size of each group is 5 bananas (392 / 196 = 5).
Response:  The number of groups is 10.
Response:  The number of groups of bananas is 2, so there are 2 groups of bananas. Since each group contains 290 bananas, the total number of groups of bananas is 2 x 290 = 580. Therefore, the size of each group of bananas is 580 / 2 = 290.
Response:  The size of each group of naranches is 16/345 = 0.047.

Explanation: According to the passage, there were 317 visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day after the long weekend. If there were 295 visitors the previous day, then there are 40 more visitors on the current day than the previous day."
"Response: 1890
Explanation:
If there were 246 visitors to Buckingham Palace in one day and 703 visitors overall, then the total number of visitors over 25 days is:

246 x 25 = 6,150

So, there were approximately 1890 visitors to Buckingham Palace in 25 days (6,150 / 25)."
"Response: 244
Explanation: According to the question, there were 100 visitors at Buckingham Palace the day before Rachel arrived, and then an additional 666 visitors came the next day. Therefore, the total number of visitors that day was 766 (100 + 666). If we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from this total, we get 244 visitors who visited Buckingham Palace that day more than the previous day."
"Response: 406 x 3 = 1218

Explanation:
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days is given as 406. If we multiply this by 3, we get 1218 as the total number of visitors to the palace during that time period."
"Response: 10637
Explanation:
If 829 people visited Buckingham Palace in the previous day and 45 more visitors arrived after the long rain shower, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 85 days is:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors in the previous day + Number of visitors after the rain shower
= 829 + 45
= 874

Therefore, the answer is 10637 (874 x 125)."
"Response: 4096
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in each day is x. Since there were 71 paintings in the palace and Rachel found out that 557 visitors came to the palace on the current day, we can write an equation:
x + 71 = 557
Now, let's find out how many days have passed since the previous day when Rachel visited the palace:
y - 1 = 57 (given)
We can solve this equation for y:
y = 57 + 1
y = 58
So, the number of days that have passed since Rachel visited the palace last time is 58. Now, we can substitute this value into the first equation:
(x + 71) × 58 = 557
Simplifying the equation:
x + 4938 = 2935
Subtracting x from both sides:
4938 - x = 2935
Dividing both sides by 4938:
x = 60
Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is 60."
"Response: 200
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 39 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 661 visitors that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the number of visitors that day and the previous day is 200 (661 - 600 = 200)."
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before that day was 522 (419 + 103).
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days is: 471 + 808 = 1279
"Response: 368
Explanation:
If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after the long weekend and 191 visitors the previous day, then the total number of visitors in the past 245 days is:
705 + 191 = 896
Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on the day after the long weekend and the number of visitors during the previous 245 days is:
896 - 457 = 368
So, there were 368 more visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day after the long weekend than during the previous 245 days."

"Response: 19
Explanation:
If the paint requires 49 g of paint to color all the feathers, and there are only 260 g of wax available (which is less than the amount required for all the feathers), then we can calculate how many feathers can be colored using the following formula:
Number of feathers = Amount of wax / Amount of paint needed per feather
In this case, the number of feathers that can be colored is:
Number of feathers = 260 g / 49 g/feather = 5.3 feathers
So, approximately 5-6 feathers can be colored with the limited amount of wax provided."
Response:  The current amount of glue is 57 grams and the required amount for painting is 22 grams. If the feathers require an total of 353 grams of glue, how many grams of glue does he already have?  Solution:  To find out how many grams of glue he already has, we need to subtract the amount of glue needed for painting from the total amount of glue he currently has: 57 - 22 = 35 grams. So, he already has 35 grams of glue.

"Response: 4689

Explanation:
To find out how many baskets of grapes can be filled with 221 burads of grapes in 77 days, we need to divide the number of burads by the number of days. So, we have:

Number of baskets = Number of burads / Number of days
= 221 / 77
= 4689

Therefore, the answer is 4689 baskets of grapes that can be filled with 221 burads of grapes in 77 days."
