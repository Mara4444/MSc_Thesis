"Response: 39
Explanation: Before reaching the bus stop, there were 39 children in the bus. Two more children entered the bus at the bus stop, so the total number of children in the bus after the bus stop is 41."
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 43 children in the bus. Since some of them got off at the stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. Therefore, 22 children (43 - 21) got off the bus at the stop."
"Response: 23
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Havia 41 crianças no autocarro. (1)
Algumas crianças saíram do autocarro. (2)
Então, havia 18 crianças no autocarro. (3)
Before the bus stop, there were more children in the bus than now. (4)
From (1), we know that the initial number of children in the bus was 41.
From (3), we know that the remaining number of children in the bus after some children left is 18.
Therefore, the difference between the initial number of children and the remaining number of children is:
41 - 18 = 23
So, there were 23 more children in the bus before the bus stop than there are now."
"Response: 11
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initial number of children in the bus: 21 (mentioned at the beginning)
* Number of children who got off the bus: 10 (mentioned in the question)
* New number of children in the bus after some entered: 16 (calculated by subtracting the number of children who got off from the initial number)

Now, let's find out how many children entered the bus:

New number of children in the bus - Initial number of children in the bus = Number of children who entered the bus
= 16 - 21
= -5

Since there are no negative numbers of children entering the bus, we can conclude that 5 children entered the bus. Therefore, the answer is 11."
"Response: 20
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Cinco crianças estavam no autocarro."" (5 children were already in the bus)
* ""Na paragem de autocarro, 63 crianças saíram do autocarro."" (63 children got off at the stop)
* ""Então había 14 crianças no total no autocarro."" (So there were 14 children left in the bus)

Now, let's find out how many more children entered the bus than got off:

Number of children who entered the bus = Number of children who got off + 5 (initial number of children in the bus)
= 63 + 5 = 68

Therefore, 20 more children entered the bus than got off."
"Response: 60 - 12 = 48

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There were 36 children in the bus initially.
* 68 children got off the bus while 36 children entered the bus.
* Therefore, there are 12 children who got off the bus more than they entered (68 - 36 = 32).

So, the correct answer is 48 (32 - 12)."
"Response: 38
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 22 children in the bus.
* When they reached the stop, 40 more children entered the bus while some left.
* So, the total number of children in the bus at the stop was 62 (22 + 40).
* Now, we are told that there were two children left in the bus.
* Therefore, the number of children who left the bus at the stop is 60 (62 - 2)."
Response: 44 (30 - 28 = 44)
"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initial number of children in the bus = 24 (mentioned in the question)
* Number of children who entered the bus = 8 (mentioned in the question)
* Number of children who left the bus =? (to be found)

From the problem statement, we know that there were initially 24 children in the bus and 8 children entered the bus while others left. So, the number of children who left the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number of children and the number of children who entered the bus:

Number of children who left the bus = 24 - 8 = 16

Therefore, 10 children left the bus more than they entered."

Response: 5 days
"Response: 20 days
Explanation: If Debbie drank 4 garrafas of water per day and had 88 garrafas initially, she would have drunk all of them in 20 days (88 / 4 = 20). Similarly, if she drank 87 garrafas of refrigerant per day and had 13 initialy, she would also finish them in 20 days (13 / 87 = 0.15 or 15 days). Therefore, the total number of days it would take to finish both types of drinks is 20 days."
"Response: 12 days
Explanation: If Debbie drank 312 garrafas of water and 4 garrafas of refrigerant per day, she would finish all 256 bottles of refrigerant in 12 days (312 / 4 = 78 days, but since there are only 12 days left after finishing the water, it means that the refrigerants will last for 12 days)."
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debbie drinks six glasses of water per day. If she buys a total of 12 glasses of water, then she will have enough for three days (6 x 3 = 18)."
"Response: 30 days
Explanation: If Debbie drank 15 garrafas of water per day and had initially purchased 95 garrafas of water, she would have consumed all of them in 60 days (95 / 15 = 6). Since she also drank 54 garrafas of refrigerant per day, which is not affected by the promotion, it will last her for 30 days (54 / 15 = 3). Therefore, the water will last her for 60 days, while the refrigerant will last her for 30 days."
"Response: 45 days
Explanation: If Debbie drank 122 garrafas of water and 9 garrafas of refrigerant per day, she would have drunk all 360 garrafas of refrigerant in 360 / 9 = 45 days."

"Response: 10
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. Since there are 66 students in each classroom and 6 luggage spaces per bus, we can calculate that 10 buses will be required to transport all the students comfortably (66/6 = 11). Therefore, ten buses will be necessary for the journey."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of classrooms = 87
Number of students = 58
Number of places per bus = 2
To calculate the number of buses needed, we can use the following formula: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of places per bus
Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of buses = 58 / 2 = 29
So, there will be 29 buses required to transport all the students for the study trip."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The school has 24 classrooms.
* There are 120 students in the school.
* Each classroom has the same number of students (not specified).
* There are 84 seats in each school bus.

Now, let's calculate the number of students per turma:

Number of students per turma = Total number of students / Number of seats in each school bus
= 120 students / 84 seats per bus
= 3 students per turma

Therefore, there are 3 students in each turma."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed to transport all the students and teachers for the school trip, we need to divide the total number of people (students + teachers) by the capacity of each bus. In this case, there are 102 alunos and 8 teachers, so the total number of people is 102 + 8 = 110. Since each bus can hold 8 people, we need 110 / 8 = 13.75 buses. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 buses."

Since Haley has 26 ball sets, each of the 13 boys who want to play balls will receive 26/13 = 2 ball sets, and each of the 50 boys who want to play cards will receive 26/50 = 1 card set."
Response: 5 each (Haley has 20 balls and there are 4 students in her class).
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave two balls to each of the boys who loved playing ball. If she had 28 balls in total and gave them out equally among 14 boys, then she would have given 2 balls to each boy."

Response: 406
Response: 831
"Response: 3940
Explanation:
Let X be the number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on any given day. Since there were 71 paintings in the palace, we know that the total number of visitors (X) + 71 = 557 (the number of visitors on the day after they ate a healthy meal).
Now, let Y be the number of days since they ate a healthy meal. We are told that Y - 1 = 56 (since they visited the palace 56 days ago), and Y = 57 (since they visited the palace yesterday).
Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:
X + 71 = 557
Substituting X = 3940 from the second equation, we get:
3940 + 71 = 557
Therefore, the answer is 3940."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 39 paintings in the Palace of Buckingham and 661 visitors arrived at the palace on the day after they had eaten a healthy meal. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the number of visitors on those two days is 661 - 600 = 91 more visitors visited the palace on the second day than on the first day."

* On the day after they ate a healthy meal, 512 visitors went to the Palace of Buckingham.
* The previous day, there were 471 visitors to the palace.
* Two days ago, there were 808 visitors to the palace.
From these statements, we can deduce that there have been x visitors to the palace over the last 89 days, where x = (512 + 471 + 808) / 3 = 3650."
