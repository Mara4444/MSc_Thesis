Response:  In Monday (pondelok), Julia played with 18 children. In Tuesday (utorok), she played with 10 more children than in Monday, so 28 children played with her in total. Therefore, there were 28 - 18 = 10 more children who played with Julia in Tuesday than in Monday.
Response:  In Monday, she played with 11 children. In Tuesday, she played with 12 children. So, in total, she played with more than 11 children and less than 12 children. Therefore, the correct answer is 11.5 (rounded to one decimal place).
Response:  Julia played with five children on Monday and then with another five children on Tuesday. If she played with 15 children in total, then how many did she play with each day? So, we can conclude that Julia played with 3 children per day (Monday + Tuesday).
"Response:  If she played with 14 children in Tuesday and 16 children in Thursday, then we can say that she played with x number of children in Monday (since she didn't play with any children on Monday). So, we have the equation:

x + 14 + 16 = 30...(1)

Now, let's solve for x using substitution method. We know that the total number of children she played with is equal to 30, so we can write:

x + 14 + 16 = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 28 = 30

Subtracting 28 from both sides gives us:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 2

So, Julia played with 2 children on Monday."
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday and more than 12 children on Tuesday, then she played with 4 additional children on Tuesday (since 16 - 12 = 4).
Response:  In Monday, she played with 8 children. If in Tuesday she played with more than 8 children, then we can say that she played with at least 9 children (since 8 + 1 = 9). So, the number of children she played with in Tuesday is between 8 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday (day 2), she played with 15 children. On Wednesday (day 3), she played with only 2 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  In Monday and Tuesday, Julia played with 15 children each day. So in total, she played with 15 + 18 = 33 children during these two days. On Wednesday, Julia played with all 97 children. Therefore, the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday is 33.
Response:  On Monday (pondelok), Julia played with 5 children. On Tuesday (utorok), she played with 9 children. And on Wednesday (streda), she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children.
Response:  On Monday (pondelok), Julia played with 2 children. In Tuesday (utorok), she played with 14 children. And in Wednesday (streda), she played with 16 children. So, we can conclude that Julia played with 14 + 16 = 30 children in total during these three days.
Response:  On Monday (pondelok), Julia played with 9 children.  On Tuesday (utorok), she played with 7 children.  On Wednesday (streda), she played with 96 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children on Wednesday than on Monday and Tuesday combined. Therefore, the answer is: 9 - 7 + 96 = 104
Response:  On Monday (pondelok), Julia played with 14 children. In Tuesday (utorok), she played with 2 more children than on Monday. So, the number of children she played with on Tuesday was 14 + 2 = 16. And in Wednesday (streda), she played with 8 fewer children than on Tuesday, so the number of children she played with on Wednesday was 16 - 8 = 8. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.
Response:  On Monday (8 children), Tuesday (11 children) and Wednesday (9 children), Julia played with a total of 28 children. So, in Tuesday, Julia played with 4 more children than on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children. And on Wednesday, she played with only 7 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday. In particular, Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 children more than on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday she played with 13 children and on Tuesday with 10 children. In total, how many children did she play with?
Response:  On Monday (pondelok), she played with 7 children. On Tuesday (utorok), she played with 13 children. And in Wednesday (streda), she played cards with 20 children. So, Julia played with a total of 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children.
"Response:  Julia played chess with 12 children on Monday and with 14 children on Thursday. In total, she spent 34 hours playing chess in both days. So, we can conclude that Julia played chess with:

$$ \text {Number of children} = \frac{\text{Total time spent playing chess}}{\text{Time spent playing with each child}} $$

We know that Julia spent 34 hours playing chess in total, and she spent 2 hours playing with each child (Monday + Thursday). Therefore, we can calculate the number of children as follows:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 $$
So, Julia played chess with 17 children in total."
Response:  In Monday, she played with 19 children for 4 hours = 4 x 19 = 76 hours.  In Tuesday, she played with 18 children for 5 hours = 5 x 18 = 90 hours. Total time spent playing chess in both days is 76 + 90 = 166 hours. So, there were more than 19 children who played with her in Tuesday compared to Monday.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 6 children. How many more children did she play with than in Tuesday? So, we have: 6 + x = 8 where x is the number of additional children that Julia played with in Tuesday. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children in Tuesday than in Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 18 children. Then, on Tuesday, she played with 4 more children (besides the ones she already played with on Monday). So, in total, Julia played with 22 children on Tuesday.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 6 children and in Tuesday she played with 17 children. So, we can say that the number of children Julia played with in Monday was less than the number of children she played with in Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday is:  6 - 17 = -11. So, Julia played with 11 fewer children in Tuesday compared to Monday.
Response:  Bobby started with 10 cookies and then ate another 25. So he had 35 cookies in total after eating both batches. If he then ate 43 more cookies, that means he has a total of 78 cookies now (35 + 43 = 78). Therefore, Bobby initially ate 10 cookies.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate another 42 pieces. Finally, he ate 63 more pieces of chocolate. So, in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 + 63 = 133 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy. Then he ate another 4 pieces. Finally, he ate 14 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, Bobby ate: 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. And he ate 14 + 4 = 18 pieces of chocolate.
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 cookies and then ate another 36. So he ate in total 74 cookies. Additionally, he also ate 16 chocolates. Therefore, the number of cookies that Bobby ate is: 74 - 16 = 58 cookies more than the number of chocolates he ate.
Response:  Bobby first ate 20 cookies and then he ate another 34 cookies. So far, he has eaten a total of 54 cookies. Then, he ate additional 18 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Bobby ate is: 54 + 18 = 72 cookies.
Response:  Bobby had 21 cookies initially and he ate 5 of them. So, now he has 21 - 5 = 16 cookies left. Then, he ate another 9 cookies. So, now he has 16 + 9 = 25 cookies left.
Response:  Bobby had 22 pieces of chocolate at first and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 22 - 5 = 17 pieces of chocolate left. Then, he ate another 5 pieces of chocolate, so he has 17 - 5 = 12 pieces of chocolate left.
Response:  Bobby had 19 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So, now he has less cookies than before. To find out how many cookies he has left, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the initial amount of cookies he had. In this case, that means we need to subtract 2 from 19: 19 - 2 = 17. Therefore, Bobby still has 17 cookies left.
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them, then he will have less pieces of candy left. Let's assume that he eats half of his candy, so he will have 32 / 2 = 16 pieces of candy left. So, Bobby will eat 20 - 16 = 4 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had initially 36 cups of sugar (since he started with 36). Then, he gave away 17 cups and kept 15 for himself. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar Bobby has left after giving away some. To do this, we can divide the number of cups he had originally by the number he gave away: Number of cups Bobby has left = Initial amount / Amount given away = 36 / 17 = 2 Therefore, Bobby has 2 cups of sugar left.
Response:  If Bobby had originally 30 cups of sugar and he gave away 23 cups, then he has left 7 cups of sugar (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  If Alan has 5 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons, then together they have 8 balloons (5 + 3). So, Allan has more balloons than Jake in the park, which is 8 - 3 = 5 more balloons.
Response:  Alan has 2 balls and Jake has 3 balls. So, in total, they have 5 balls (2 + 3). Now, let's go to the park where Jake has more than 2 balls. Therefore, Jake has x balls more than Alan in the park. Since Jake has 3 balls at home, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 3 - 2 = 1. So, Jake has 1 ball more than Alan in the park.
Response:  If Alan threw 2 balls into the park and Jake caught them both, then Jake has 2 balls in total. So, Jake caught 0 balls less than Alan threw.
Response:  If Jake threw 6 balls into the park and he threw 4 more than Allan, then Allan threw how many balls into the park? So, we can write an equation as follows:  Balls thrown by Jake = 6  Balls thrown by Allan + Balls thrown by Jake - Balls thrown by Allan =?  Now let's solve for the unknown quantity (Balls thrown by Allan). We know that Jake threw 4 more balls than Allan, so if Jake threw x balls, Allan threw x - 4 balls. Substituting this value in the previous equation, we get:  x - 4 = 6  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, Allan threw 10 balls into the park.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balls in the park and he gives 2 to Jake, then Allan has 3 balls left (5 - 2 = 3). Now, if Jake gets 6 balls more than Allan, that means Jake has 9 balls (6 + 3 = 9) in total. So, Jake has 9 - 3 = 6 balls more than Allan.
Response:  Alan had 3 balls and Jake had 5 balls in total before they went to the park. Then, Alan bought more 2 balls after going to the park. So, the final number of balls that Alan and Jake had in the park is: 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
"Response: 
Alan has 2 balls and Jake has 4 balls in total. Then, Alan buys more 3 balls after that. So, now Alan has 5 balls (2 + 3 = 5) and Jake still has 4 balls. Therefore, Alan has more balls than Jake in the park, i.e., 5 > 4."
"Response: 
Alan has 2 balls and gives 1 ball to Jake, so now Jake has 6 balls. Then, Alan buys more 3 balls in the park, which means he has 5 balls left (2 + 1 = 5). So, Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 more ball than Alan in the park. Therefore, the correct answer is 1."
Response:  Alan has 5 balloons and gives 4 to Jake. So, Alan has 5 - 4 = 1 balloon left. Then, he buys more balloons in the park (3). Therefore, Alan has 1 + 3 = 4 balloons in total.
Response:  Alan has 6 balls and Jake has 2 balls in the park. Then Jake buys another 3 balls in the park. So, now Jake has 5 balls (2 + 3) more than Alan in the park. Therefore, the number of balls that Alan has is less than or equal to 6 - 5 = 1. So, the answer is 1 ball.
Response:  Alan has 6 balls and Jake has 3 balls at first. Then Jake buys another 4 balls in the park. So, Jake has 7 balls (3 + 4) more than Alan in the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls that Jake has and the number of balls that Alan has is 7.
Response:  Alan has 5 balloons and gives 2 to Jake, so now Jake has 6 balloons. Then, Jake buys another 3 balloons in the park, so he has a total of 9 balloons. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  Alan had 3 balls and 20 marbles before he went to the park with Jake. If Jake brought 5 balls and 59 marbles to the park, then together they had 3 + 5 = 8 balls and 20 + 59 = 79 marbles at the park. So, Alan and Jake had 8 balls and 79 marbles in the park.
Response:  Alan had 7 balloons and 5 kites in the park initially. Then, Jake added 6 balloons and 4 kites to the total amount of balloons and kites in the park. So, the final number of balloons that Alan and Jake had together in the park is: 7 + 6 = 13 balloons. And the final number of kites they had together is: 5 + 4 = 9 kites.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balloons and he gives 3 to Jake, then Allan has 2 balloons left.  If Jake then takes all of Allan's remaining balloons (which is 2), then Jake has 4 balloons in total. So, Jake took 4 balloons from Allan.
Response:  Allan had 2 balls in the park and then he bought more 3 balls. So, Allan has 5 balls in total (2 + 3 = 5). Now, Jake brought 6 balls to the park. To find out how many balls Jake has more than Allan, we need to subtract the number of balls Allan has from the number of balls Jake has: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Jake has one ball more than Allan in the park.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages.
So, if Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese per day, then in one day (24 hours), he spends a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours studying both languages.
Now, let's assume that Ryan continues this routine for n days. If he spends x hours studying English and y hours studying Chinese during those n days, then the total number of hours he spends studying English is xn, and the total number of hours he spends studying Chinese is yn.
Since Ryan spends more time studying English than Chinese, we can say that x > y. Therefore, the difference between the number of hours Ryan spends studying English and Chinese is greater than the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. In other words, Ryan spends more time studying English than he does studying Chinese."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many hours he spends studying Chinese more than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, if Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese, then he spends a total of 13 hours (6 + 7) studying both languages. Therefore, he spends 13 - 6 = 7 hours studying Chinese more than English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends in total 3 + x hours per day learning both languages where x is the number of hours he spends learning Chinese. Since he spends 4 hours per day studying both languages overall, we can write an equation as follows: 3 + x = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. So, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese.
Response:  If he spends 7 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then if he spends 2 more hours than he does learning English, that means he spends x hours learning Chinese. So we can set up an equation like this: 7 + x = 9 (where 9 is the total number of hours he spends learning both languages). Solving for x gives us x = 2. Therefore, he spends 2 hours learning Chinese each day.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and some additional time learning English, we can assume that he spends x hours learning English more than Chinese. Since he spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5 - 2 = 3
So, Ryan spends 3 hours more studying English than Chinese each day."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and Chinese for 5 days, he will spend a total of:

English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
So, in total, Ryan will spend 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese every day, then he spends a total of:

6 hours/day x 7 days/week = 42 hours/week studying English
5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week studying Chinese
So, in one week, Ryan spends a total of:
42 hours/week + 35 hours/week = 77 hours/week studying both languages combined."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours studying English every day and 4 hours studying Chinese every day for 6 days, then he will spend a total of:

5 x 6 = 30 hours studying English
4 x 6 = 24 hours studying Chinese
So, Ryan will spend 30 + 24 = 54 hours studying both languages altogether."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent in total:

4 hours/day x 86 days = 324 hours learning English
6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours learning Chinese
Therefore, Ryan spends approximately 324 hours per year learning English and 504 hours per year learning Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day. So he studies English for 6/14 = 0.42857 (approximately) hours per day.
He also spends 7 hours studying Chinese and 3 hours studying Spanish. Therefore, he studies Chinese for 7/14 = 0.50000 (approximately) hours per day and Spanish for 3/14 = 0.21429 (approximately) hours per day.
So in total, Ryan spends approximately 0.42857 + 0.50000 + 0.21429 = 1.14386 (approximately) hours per day studying all three languages combined."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English (E). Then, he spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese (C) and 58 hours per day studying Spanish (S). To find out how many hours Ryan spends studying English more than he does Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages:

Total time studying E + C = 6h/day × 7days/week = 42h/week
Total time studying E + S = 6h/day × 7days/week = 42h/week
Time studying E more than C = Total time studying E + S - Time studying C = 42h/week - 3h/day = 39h/week
Therefore, Ryan spends 39 hours per week studying English more than he does Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish. So far, he has spent a total of 13 hours (7 + 2) studying languages. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the total number of hours he spends studying languages: 13 - 4 = 9 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 9 hours more studying English than Spanish."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English, which means he learns for a total of 10 hours (2 x 5) in one week. 
He also spends 4 hours per day learning Spanish, which means he learns for a total of 28 hours (4 x 7) in one week.  So, Ryan spends more time learning Chinese than Spanish. The difference between the two is 18 hours (28 - 10). Therefore, Ryan spends more than 18 hours learning Chinese each week than he does learning Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and he spends 2 hours studying English each day, then he spends a total of 6 hours (3 + 2) studying English per day. Therefore, he spends 6 / 2 = 3 hours studying Chinese each day.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 + 5 = 9 hours per day studying both languages together. So, in one week (7 days), Ryan will spend a total of 9 x 7 = 63 hours studying both languages combined.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 8 plastic bottles and then found additional 7 plastic bottles on Tuesday. So, in total, she had 15 plastic bottles (8 + 7).
Response:  On Monday, she collected 7 plastic bottles. On Tuesday, she found additional 12 plastic bottles. How many more plastic bottles did she find on Tuesday than on Monday?  Therefore, the answer is 12 - 7 = 5 more plastic bottles were found on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 4 pieces of plastic. If she found more pieces of plastic on Tuesday, then she had a total of 6 containers (taşek) to collect. So, if she found additional pieces of plastic on Tuesday, it means that she filled up 2 more containers with plastic (since there are 6 containers in total). Therefore, she collected 2 + 4 = 6 pieces of plastic on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 2 pieces of plastic. On the second day, she found additional 4 pieces of plastic. If she had a total of 8 bags, how many bags did she have on Monday? So, the answer is 2.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 10 plastic bottles for recycling. On Tuesday, she found 3 more plastic bottles and on Wednesday, she found another 7 plastic bottles. So in total, she collected 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 plastic bottles.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 8 plastic bottles for recycling. On Tuesday, she found 10 more plastic bottles and 4 additional ones after that. So, in total, she collected 18 plastic bottles (8 + 10 + 4 = 18).
Response:  On Monday, she collected 3 pieces of plastic. On Tuesday, she found additional 7 pieces of plastic and 44 pieces of foil. So, in total, she had how many pieces of plastic?  We can use multiplication to find out. The number of pieces of plastic on Monday was 3, plus the number of pieces of plastic found on Tuesday is 7 + 44 = 51 pieces of plastic. Therefore, the answer is 51 pieces of plastic.
"Response:  We know that there are more red beans than green beans in the bowl. So, if there are 17 red beans and 16 green beans, then we can say that the number of red beans is greater than the number of green beans. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many red beans are in the bowl?"" is 17."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red marbles and 11 green marbles in the box. So, we can write this as an equation: 5C + 11 = X, where C is the number of red marbles (i.e., 5) and X is the total number of marbles in the box (i.e., 16). Solving for X, we get: X = 27. Therefore, there are more than 11 green marbles in the box.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red beans and some green beans in the bowl. So, if we have 15 beans in total, then the number of green beans must be equal to 15 - 10 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green beans in the bowl.
Response:  We know that there are three red beans and one green bean in the bowl initially. If there are now 10 more green beans than red beans, then the number of green beans is 10 + 3 = 13. So, there are 13 green beans in the bowl.
Response:  We have 7 red balls, 15 yellow balls, and 8 green balls in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation: 7 + 15 + 8 = x, where x is the total number of balls in the basket. Now, we need to solve for x. Since there are 30 balls in total (7+15+8), so x=30. Therefore, there are 30 balls in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are more yellow balls than red balls in the basket. So, if we have x red balls and y yellow balls, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 7 (number of red balls)
y = 7 - x (number of yellow balls)
Now, we want to find out how many green balls are in the basket more than the number of red balls. So, let's subtract the number of red balls from the total number of balls:
Number of green balls = Total number of balls - Number of red balls
= 70 - 7
= 63
Therefore, there are 63 green balls in the basket more than the number of red balls."
"Response:  We know that there are 2 red apples in the basket and 6 yellow apples. So far, we have:
Red apples = 2 Yellow apples = 6 Now, let's find out how many green apples are in the basket. According to the question, there are 14 green apples in the basket. Therefore, the final answer is: Green apples = 14"
"Response:  We know that there are more red balls than yellow balls in the basket. So, if we have x red balls and y yellow balls, then we can write an equation as follows:
x > y (red balls > yellow balls)
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:
x = 19 (red balls), y = 11 (yellow balls)
So, we can see that there are indeed more red balls than yellow balls in the basket!"
"Response:  We know that there are 6 red beans in the basket, so let's say R represents the number of red beans. Since we also know that there are 90 yellow beans and 16 green beans, we can represent them as Y and G respectively. Now, based on the information given in the question, we have:
R + Y + G = 6 (red beans) + 90 (yellow beans) + 16 (green beans) = 172
So, the total number of beans in the basket is 172. Therefore, the number of red beans in the basket is 6/172 = 0.035 × 100 = 3.5%. Similarly, the number of green beans in the basket is 16/172 = 0.092 × 100 = 9.2%."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red beans in the basket. So, we can write this as follows:

Red beans = 18

We also know that there are 14 yellow beans in the basket. So, we can write this as follows:

Yellow beans = 14

Finally, we know that there are 17 green beans in the basket. So, we can write this as follows:

Green beans = 17

So, to summarize, there are 18 red beans, 14 yellow beans, and 17 green beans in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red beans in the basket, so let's call them R. The total number of beans is given as 14 + 6 = 20. So, we can write an equation: R + (Yellow + Green) = 20. Now, we need to find out how many yellow and green beans are in the basket. From the question, we know that there are 14 yellow beans and 6 green beans. So, we can substitute these values into our equation: R + (14 + 6) = 20. Simplifying the equation, we get: R + 20 = 20. Solving for R, we get: R = 0. Therefore, there are no red beans in the basket.
"Response:  We have 65 kiosks and each kiosk has 7 red balls and 3 green balls. So, in total we have:

Red balls: 7 x 65 = 455 red balls
Green balls: 3 x 65 = 195 green balls
Total number of balls: 455 + 195 = 650 balls
Therefore, there are 650 balls in each kiosk."
Response:  We have 11 baskets and each basket has 10 red balls and 18 green balls. So, in total we have: 11 x 10 = 110 red balls 11 x 18 = 198 green balls Therefore, there are 110 + 198 = 308 balls in all the baskets combined.
Response:  We have 6 baskets and each basket has 16 red balls and 18 green balls. So, in total we have:  16 x 6 = 96 red balls 18 x 6 = 108 green balls Therefore, there are 96 + 108 = 204 balls in all 6 baskets combined.
Response:  We have 7 košík (baskets) and each basket has 10 red balls and 2 green balls. So, in total we have 7 x 10 = 70 red balls and 7 x 2 = 14 green balls. Therefore, there are 14 green balls in all 7 baskets combined.
"Response:  We have 7 bowls in total. Each bowl has either 4 red beans or 3 green beans. So, we can write an equation: 

Total number of red beans = Number of bowls with red beans x Total number of red beans per bowl
Total number of green beans = Number of bowls with green beans x Total number of green beans per bowl

Now let's substitute the values given in the question:
Number of bowls with red beans = 7 (total number of bowls) / 2 (number of bowls with red beans) = 3.5
Total number of red beans = 3.5 x 4 = 14

Similarly, we can find the number of green beans as follows:
Number of bowls with green beans = 7 - 3 = 4
Total number of green beans = 4 x 3 = 12

Therefore, there are 14 red beans and 12 green beans in all 7 bowls combined."
Response:  We have two baskets with apples and pears. Each basket has 4 red apples and some green pears. If there are altogether 12 pears in all the baskets, how many green pears are in each basket?
Response:  We know that there are 16 broskyn in total and 13 of them are red. So, we have 13/16 = 0.8125 (red broskyn). Since we also know that one of the remaining broskyn is green, we can calculate the number of green broskyn as follows: Number of green broskyn = Total number of broskyn - Number of red broskyn = 16 - 13 = 3 green broskyn. Therefore, there are 3 green broskyn in the basket.
"Response:  We know that each basket has 19 red and 4 green balls. If there are 15 baskets in total, then we can calculate how many red and green balls there are in total as follows:
Red balls: 19 x 15 = 285 Red balls Green balls: 4 x 15 = 60 Green balls Total number of balls: 285 + 60 = 345 balls"
"Response:  We know that there are 10 boxes in total and each box has an equal number of red and green marbles. So, if we have x red marbles and y green marbles in one box, then the total number of marbles in all boxes is 10x + 10y. Since there are 4 red marbles and 6 green marbles in each box, we can write:

x = 4 (number of red marbles in one box)
y = 6 (number of green marbles in one box)

Now, let's substitute these values into the equation for the total number of marbles:

10x + 10y = 10(4) + 10(6) = 40 + 60 = 100

So, there are 100 marbles in total."
Response:  We have 6 green beans, 60 yellow ones and 2 red ones in a basket. How many more green beans are there than red ones? So, we can say that the number of green beans is greater than the number of red ones. Therefore, the answer to your question is: More than 2.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he added more action figures to the same shelf. If he added 3 more action figures, then the total number of action figures on the shelf would be: 4 + 3 = 7 action figures. So, Jerry added 3 more action figures to the shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures initially in his room. He then added 7 more action figures to the rack, so now he has 10 action figures in total. Therefore, there were originally 3 action figures on the rack (Jerry's initial collection).
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books in his room initially. Then he added another 6 action figures to the rack. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had was: 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, there were 10 action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his room initially. When he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, there were now: 5 + 7 = 12 action figures total. So, the number of action figures was greater than the number of books (9). Therefore, the answer is 12 - 9 = 3.
Response:  Jerry had initially 2 action figures and 10 books in his room. Then he added another 4 action figures to the shelf. How many more books and action figures does Jerry have now?
Response:  Jerry had 9 books on his shelf initially. Then, another 10 books were added to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 9 + 10 = 19 books on his shelf now.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books in his room initially. Then he brought more books (4) to the library. So, the total number of books is now 6 (2 + 4). Now, let's find out how many action figures Jerry has left. He had 7 - 4 = 3 action figures left after bringing more books to the library. Therefore, there are 3 more action figures than books in Jerry's room.
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Then he added another 9 books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 16 items (books + action figures) on his shelf now.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures in his room initially. Then he added another 4 action figures and took away 5 old ones. So, the number of action figures left on the shelf is: 8 + 4 - 5 = 17. Therefore, there were 17 action figures left on the shelf after Jerry's actions.
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures in his room initially. Then he added another 4 action figures and removed some old ones. So, he has 6 action figures now. To find out how many of them are new, we can divide the total number of action figures by the number of new ones: Number of new action figures = Total number of action figures - Initial number of action figures New action figures = 6 - 3 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 new action figures among the 6 that Jerry has now.
"Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he added more action figures and took away 10 old ones. So, the total number of action figures Jerry has now is: 7 + (number of new action figures) - (number of old action figures taken away) =?  We are given that there are 8 new action figures added, so we can substitute this value in the equation: 7 + 8 - 10 =?  Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 =? Solving for ""?"" gives us the answer: Jerry has 15 action figures on his shelf now."
Response:  Jerry had initially 5 action figures on his shelf and then added 3 more. He took down 7 old ones, so he has 10 action figures on his shelf now. Therefore, the number of action figures that Jerry originally had on his shelf is 5.
Response:  Jerry has 9 action figures in his room initially. If he added 7 more action figures later, then the total number of action figures he has is 9 + 7 = 16. Now, if he also has 10 books on his shelf, how many action figures are left after subtracting the number of books from the total number of action figures? So, the answer is 16 - 10 = 6 action figures are left on his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures and 4 accessories in his room. Then he added another 2 action figures to the collection. So, there were more than 3 action figures on his shelf. The correct answer is: More than 5 action figures.
Response:  Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf initially. When he added more action figures to the rack, there were 4 action figures in total (including the initial 3). So, the number of action figures = 4. Now, let's find out how many books Jerry had after adding more action figures to the rack. We know that for every 2 action figures, Jerry got 1 book. Therefore, if Jerry had 4 action figures, he would have gotten 2 books (since 4 x 2 = 8). So, the number of books Jerry had after adding more action figures to the rack = 2.
Response:  We have 2 birds already on the meadow (Na). Then, more birds come to join them (Prišli). So, we have a total of 4 birds now (2 + 2 = 4) on the meadow. Next, we are asked how many additional birds will come to join them if there are currently 6 birds in total on the meadow. Therefore, the answer is 6 - 4 = 2 additional birds will come to join the existing ones on the meadow.
Response:  At first, there were 3 birds on the fence (Na plotove sedeli najaké vtáky). Then, 4 more birds came (Prišli k nim ďalšie 4 vtáky). So, in total, there are now 7 birds on the fence (Teraz sa na plotine nachádzu 5 vtákov). Therefore, to find out how many birds were initially on the fence, we can subtract the number of birds that arrived from the current total: 5 - 4 = 1. So, there were 1 bird on the fence at the beginning (Ak je na plotine teraz 5 vtákov, koľko vtákov bolo na plotine na počátku).
Response:  We have 4 sparrows and 46 starlings at first. Then, another 6 sparrows come. How many sparrows are sitting on the tree now? So, we can say that there are 4 + 6 = 10 sparrows sitting on the tree.
Response:  We have three sparrows and two robins sitting on the branch. Then, five more sparrows come. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds sitting on the branch.
Response:  There are three sparrows and four storks sitting on the branch. If two more sparrows come, then there will be six sparrows in total (3 + 2 = 6). So, the number of sparrows is 6. Similarly, we can calculate that the number of storks is also 4. Therefore, the final answer is 6 sparrows and 4 storks sit on the branch.
Response:  We have 2 sparrows and 6 starlings at first. Then, 3 more sparrows come. So, now we have 2 + 3 = 5 sparrows in total. And there are still 6 starlings. Therefore, the number of starlings is 6 - 5 = 1 more than the number of sparrows. Hence, there are 1 more starling than sparrow.
Response:  We have 4 crows and 6 storks at first. Then, two more storks come. So, we have 2 + 6 = 8 storks in total now. Finally, there are 8 storks sitting on the beach.
Response:  We have three sparrows and four storks initially sitting on the branch. If six more storks join them, then we will have: 3 + 4 = 7 storks in total. So, there are seven birds (three sparrows and four storks) sitting on the branch.
Response:  We have 6 birds and 3 sparrows sitting on the branch. Then, 2 more sparrows come. So, now we have 6 birds and 5 sparrows (including the new ones). Therefore, there are 11 creatures in total sitting on the branch.
Response:  We have 4 sparrows and 3 crows at first. Then, another 6 crows join them. So, in total, we have 4 + 3 = 7 birds of any kind (sparrows or crows) on the field.
Response:  We have 6 birds sitting on the fence and then 4 more birds come along with 8 storks. So in total we have 6 + 4 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 2 birds and 5 more birds come to join them. So, in total we have 7 birds sitting on the fence (2 + 5 = 7). Now, there are also 4 storks coming to join them. So, the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 7 + 4 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 creatures sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 3 crows and 2 ravens at first. Then, we get 6 more crows and 2 more ravens. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 crows and 2 + 2 = 4 ravens. Therefore, there are 5 - 2 = 3 crows more than ravens on the field.
Response:  We have 5 storks and 3 cranes sitting on the meadow. Then come another 4 cranes. How many more cranes are there than storks sitting on the meadow?  Solution: Total number of birds = Number of storks + Number of cranes = 5 + 3 = 8. So, there are 8 cranes more than storks sitting on the meadow.
Response:  We have 6 sheep and 2 ducks at first. Then, we get additional 3 ducks. So, in total, we have:  Sheep = 6 + (3 x 1) = 9 Ducks = 2 + (3 x 1) = 4 Therefore, there are more sheep than ducks on the field.
Response:  We have 3 cows (vtáky) and 7 other animals (štorky). So, there are 3 + 7 = 10 animals in total. Since we asked how many sheep are more than ducks, we can say that the number of sheep is greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 10 - 3 = 7 sheep.
Response:  First chapter has 48 pages and second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many pages are in the first chapter more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the first chapter. So, the answer is:  Number of pages in the first chapter more than the second chapter = 48 - 11 = 37 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:  Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and the first chapter has 60 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:  Number of pages in the first chapter = 60 pages Total number of pages in the book = Number of pages in the second chapter + Number of pages in the first chapter  Substituting the given values, we get: Number of pages in the second chapter = Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in the first chapter  Now, let's substitute the values: Number of pages in the second chapter = 93 pages - 60 pages  = 33 pages So, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and the second chapter has 36 pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in second chapter Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of pages in first chapter = 67 - 36 = 31 pages So, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  The book has three chapters with the following number of pages: Chapter 1 - 66 pages Chapter 2 - 35 pages Chapter 3 - 24 pages Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages So, the book has 125 pages.
"Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:

Number of pages in first chapter - Number of pages in second chapter = 91 - 23 = 68

So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter."
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, so let's call it x. The second chapter has 18 pages, so let's call it y. And the third chapter has 3 pages, so let's call it z. We know that y > z, because the second chapter has more pages than the third chapter. So we can write an inequality: y > z. Now we want to find out how many pages the second chapter has. Can you use algebraic manipulation or numerical methods to solve for y in terms of x and z?
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages more than the third chapter. So, if the third chapter has 21 pages, then the first chapter must have 53 + 21 = 74 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 74 pages more than the third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1861 pages.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 23 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters First chapter pages = 23 x (1/2) = 11 pages Therefore, there are 11 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  The book has two chapters with a total of 81 pages. Since the second chapter has 68 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the second chapter = 81 - 68 = 13 pages. Therefore, there are 13 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  We know that 62 soldiers went fishing in the morning and 39 of them returned. So, the number of soldiers who did not return is 62 - 39 = 23. Therefore, 23 more soldiers went fishing than returned.
Response:  At 5:00 am, there were 52 soldiers who wanted to go fishing. Then, at 6:10 am, 61 soldiers decided to go fishing. How many soldiers learned how to fish after watching their colleagues go fishing?
Response:  We know that in the morning there were 15 commanders who went fishing. If they took 32 more commanders in the day, then we can say that the total number of commanders who went fishing is: 15 + 32 = 47 commanders.
Response:  We know that some commanders went rowing early in the morning and 7 of them went for a ride later. If during that day, 60 people took part in rowing, how many of them went out to row in the morning?
Response:  In the morning, 36 soldiers went fishing together with 13 commanders.  In the evening, 49 soldiers and commanders went fishing together. So in total, there were 36 + 13 = 49 people who went fishing together.
Response:  We know that 44 soldiers went out in the morning and 39 returned in the evening. So, we have to find out how many more soldiers went out than returned.  To do this, we can subtract the number of soldiers who returned from the total number of soldiers who went out: 44 - 39 = 5. Therefore, 5 more soldiers went out in the morning than returned in the evening.
Response:  We know that 53 + x = 48 (x is the number of boats that were sailing in the evening). Now we have to find out how many boats were sailing in the morning. So, we can write an equation: 53 - x = 49. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. Therefore, there were 4 more boats sailing in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  We know that there are 33 soldiers who went out in the morning and 34 policemen who arrived later. So, altogether we have 67 people (33 + 34). Now, among these 67 people, only 10 were able to learn how to sail during their stay at sea. Therefore, the number of soldiers who learned how to sail is 10/67 = 0.15 or 15%.
Response:  We know that 13 táborníkov were sailing and 59 táborníkov went on tour in the morning. 21 táborníkov left to go sailing. So, how many táborníkov participated in sailing together?  Answer:  The sum of 13 + 21 = 34 táborníkov participated in sailing together.
Response:  We know that 29 táborníkov were going to sail and 66 táborníkov went for a tour in the morning.  After 26 táborníkov left to go sailing, how many táborníkov remained for the tour?  Therefore, there were 40 táborníkov (66 - 26) who went for a tour in the morning.
Response:  We know that there were 41 soldiers who went for a boat ride and 4 commanders who went out for a walk in the morning.  Since 26 soldiers left to go fishing, we can conclude that 15 soldiers (41 - 26) stayed behind to go boating. Therefore, 15 soldiers went fishing.
Response:  We know that 46 táborníkov (officers) went out for rowing in one day. Of these, 43 officers started rowing early and 3 more joined them later. So, we have to find out how many officers went for rowing after breakfast. Therefore, the number of officers who went for rowing after breakfast is 3.
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from her tree and originally there were 7 apples on the tree, then we can assume that after she picked some of them, there are now fewer apples on the tree than before. So, the number of apples left on the tree is equal to the original number minus the number of apples picked. In this case, if the original number was 7, then the number of apples left on the tree would be: 7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 apples still on Rachel's tree.
Response:  Rachel picked some apples from the tree and now there are still 2 apples left on the branch. So, she must have picked at least 4 apples (the initial number). Therefore, Rachel picked 4 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has 5 apples left. If three of them are ripe and the remaining two are not yet ripe, then how many unripe apples does the tree have? So, there are 2 unripe apples left on the tree. Therefore, the number of unripe apples is 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from her tree and left 7 unripe ones on the tree. If 6 of them are ripe and one is not yet ripe, then there must be 13 ripe apples on the tree at the beginning (since we subtracted 2 from the total number). So, the answer is 13.
Response:  Rachel collected 6 ripe apples from her tree and now has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples left. So initially, she had 6 - 2 = 4 apples on the tree.
Response:  Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from her tree. Now she has 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples. So initially, the tree had 3 + 2 = 5 ripe apples.
Response:  Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree and then two new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has six apples left. So, at the beginning, the tree had 6 + 7 = 13 apples.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 apples on the tree (Rachel picked 2). Then, new apples grew on the tree and there are now 3 additional apples. So, in total, there are 7 apples on the tree right now (4 + 3 = 7).
Response:  Rachel has 52 apples and picks two from one of her trees. Now there are seven apples left on the tree. So, at the beginning, Rachel had 52 - 2 = 50 apples on her tree.
Response:  If Rachel has three apple trees and she picked 8 apples from each tree, then she picked a total of 24 apples (3 x 8 = 24). Now, if there were originally 9 apples on all the trees, and Rachel picked 24, then there are now only 9 - 24 = -15 apples left on the trees. So, the answer is -15.
Response:  If Rachel has 4 apple trees and she picked 7 apples from each tree, then she picked a total of 4 x 7 = 28 apples. So, now there are 28 - 29 = -1 apples left on the trees. Therefore, Rachel picked none.
Response:  We know that Ed has 19 more gulicks than Doug. So if Doug had x gulicks, then Ed would have 19 + x gulicks. Since Ed now has more gulicks than Doug, we can say that Doug must have strated some of his gulicks to Ed. Therefore, we can write an equation: 19 + x = Doug's original number of gulicks - Number of gulicks Stratied by Doug to Ed. Solving for x, we get:  x = Doug's original number of gulicks - 19. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: 19 + x = Doug's original number of gulicks - (Doug's original number of gulicks - 19)  Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 3. So Doug originally had 3 gulicks, and he strategically gave 16 gulicks to Ed.
Response:  If Ed has more than 10 golf balls than Doug, then he must have at least 45 golf balls (since 10 is less than 45). So, we can say that Ed has 45 or more golf balls than Doug.
Response:  If Ed has 22 gulicks and he gives away 7 of them to his son, then Ed will have 15 gulicks left (22 - 7 = 15). Now, if we know that Doug had more gulicks than Ed before they started giving away some of their gulicks, then we can conclude that Doug must have had at least as many gulicks as Ed after they gave away some of their gulicks. Therefore, Doug must have had at least 15 gulicks (the same number as Ed) after they gave away some of their gulicks.
Response:  If Ed has 5 more gulichoks than Doug and Doug had 3 gulichoks on his ice cream, then Ed started with 27 - 3 = 24 gulichoks.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 24 gulicks than Doug because he sold 9 more gulicks after Doug had sold 27 of his own. So, if Doug sold 27 gulicks and Ed sold 9 more, then Ed must have sold at least 36 gulicks (27 + 9 = 36). Therefore, Ed has more than 24 gulicks than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 29 guličok than Doug because he had 17 of his own guličok on his ice skate. So, if Ed has x guličok and Doug has y guličok, we can write an equation:  x > 29 + y. Now, we need to find out how many guličok Ed has more than Doug. Can you solve for x now?
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 19 guličok than Doug initially (Ed had 20 - 19 = 1 guličok more). Then, Ed gave away some of his guličok to Irisk. Since he has 8 guličok less now than before, we can calculate how many guličok he gave away as follows:  Number of guličok given away = Total number of guličok Ed had after giving them away - Initial number of guličok Ed had = 8 - 20 = -12 guličok So, Ed gave away 12 guličok to Irisk.
Response:  If Ed has 30 more guličok than Doug and he distributed them equally among his 21 eyes, then each eye would get 1.46 (30/21) guličok from Ed. Now if Ed had 91 guličok in total and gave away 21 of them, then he must have had 70 guličok left (91 - 21 = 70). So, Ed had 70 guličok more than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 12 more gulicks than Doug and he distributed 20 of them equally among his friends, then:  Ed had 12 + 20 = 32 gulics initially.  Since Mal has 17 gulics now, and he gave 20 to Ed, then:  Mal had 17 - 20 = -3 gulics initially.
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and only 42 suggested adding salt, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is greater than 42. We can conclude that at least 406 students (408 - 42) suggested adding potatoes to the menu.
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 489 students suggested adding salt, then there are more students who suggested adding salt than those who suggested adding potatoes. So, the number of students who suggested adding salt is greater than the number of students who suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, the answer is (489 - 479) = 90.
"Response:  We know that out of 310 students, 185 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu. So, the number of students who did not suggest adding potatoes is:

310 - 185 = 125

Now, we need to find out how many students suggested adding salt to the menu. The question states that ""iní"" (others) suggested adding salt to the menu, which means that not all 125 students who didn't suggest adding potatoes also suggested adding salt. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding salt can be calculated as follows:

125 - (number of students who suggested both potatoes and salt)

We don't have any information about the number of students who suggested both potatoes and salt, so let's assume it's zero. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding salt to the menu is:

125 - 0 = 125

So, 125 students suggested adding salt to the menu."
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding salt to the menu. This means that 14 students (264 - 128) did not suggest adding salt. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu is 14.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and only 63 students suggested adding salt, then there are more students who want potatoes than those who want salt. So, we can say that 457 - 63 = 404 students wanted potatoes.
"Response:  If 182 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and only 166 students suggested adding saltier food than those who suggested potatoes, then we can say that:

Number of students suggesting saltier food = Total number of students - Number of students suggesting potatoes
= 182 - 166
= 16

Therefore, 16 students suggested adding saltier food than those who suggested potatoes."
Response:  If 324 students suggested adding bread soup to the menu, and 374 students suggested adding salted food, then together they made up 698 (324 + 374) students who gave suggestions for new dishes. Finally, if 128 students suggested adding beef stroganoff, that means there were altogether 826 (698 + 128) students who participated in suggesting new dishes.
Response:  If 257 students suggested adding potatoes, and 120 students suggested adding salt, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is greater than 120.  Similarly, if 97 students suggested adding peas, and 257 students suggested adding potatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding peas than those who suggested adding potatoes. So, the number of students who suggested adding peas is less than 97.  Finally, we know that at least 97 students suggested adding something (since 97 students suggested adding peas), so the total number of students who did not suggest adding anything is less than or equal to 163 (the difference between 257 and 97).
"Response:  If 144 students suggested adding potatoes, and 467 students suggested adding salt, then together they added 144 + 467 = 611 units of those ingredients.  However, only 79 students suggested adding mushrooms, so their total contribution is 79 units. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding more potatoes than mushrooms is:

$$ \text{Number of students who suggested adding more potatoes} = \text{Total number of students who suggested adding potatoes} - \text{Total number of students who suggested adding mushrooms} $$

$$ = 611 - 79 = 532 $$

So, out of all the students surveyed, 532 suggested adding more potatoes than mushrooms."
Response:  If 228 students suggested adding potatoes, and 337 students suggested adding salt, then there are more students who suggested adding salt than those who suggested adding potatoes. So, we can say that A > B (A is greater than B). Now, let's consider the third option - only 23 students suggested adding mushrooms. Therefore, the number of students who did not suggest adding any of these three options (potatoes, salt, or mushrooms) is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who suggested each of these three options. We can write this as follows: Total Students = Number of Students Who Suggested Potatoes + Number of Students Who Suggested Salt + Number of Students Who Suggested Mushrooms. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total Students = 228 + 337 + 23 = 588. So, the number of students who did not suggest adding any of these three options is equal to 588 - (228 + 337 + 23) = 128.
Response:  We know that out of 450 students who participated in the survey, 42% (or 180) chose to add borscht to the menu, while 29% (or 137) chose to add sour cream. This means that 67% (or 293) of the participants did not participate in the vote or did not provide an answer. Therefore, the number of students who provided an answer is 450 - 293 = 157.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potatoes and salt to the menu, that means 218/351 = 62% of the students wanted to add potatoes and salt.  Therefore, 351 - 62% = 290 students did not suggest adding potatoes and salt to the menu.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding salt to the menu and 330 suggested adding vegetable soup, then there are 599 students who did not suggest adding either of those options (since 269 + 330 = 599). Therefore, among the remaining 76 students who suggested adding potatoes, more than half (48) suggested adding them in greater quantities than those who suggested adding salt or vegetable soup. So, the answer is 48.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, the difference between the number of boys and girls is: 841 - 34 = 807. Therefore, there are 807 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at this school. From the given information, we can determine that there are 232 girls and 163 boys. Therefore, the number of boys is 163. So, the answer is 163.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys, then there must be 469 boys in the school. Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in school. So, if there are 635 girls and 510 boys, then there must be 124 boys (635 - 510 = 124).
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in school. So, if there are 868 girls and 281 boys, then the number of students is equal to the sum of these two numbers plus the number of boys. Therefore, we can write: Number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 868 + 281 = 549.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in this school. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) = 700 + (142 - 700) = 368 Therefore, there are 368 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in total at school, and 418 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 706 - 418 = 288. Therefore, there are 288 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in school. Then, another 44 girls joined the school. So, we need to find out how many girls are now in the school. To do this, we can use the following calculation: Number of girls after joining = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls Joining = 902 + 44 = 946 girls Now, we have 946 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in school initially. Then, 465 girls joined the school. So, we need to find out how many more girls than boys joined the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of boys who joined from the total number of girls who joined:  Number of girls who joined = 465 - 410 = 55. Therefore, there are 55 more girls than boys in the school now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in school. If 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school, then we need to find out how many girls are left. So, the number of girls who joined the school is equal to the difference between the initial number of girls and the total number of students who joined the school. Therefore, the number of girls currently in school = Initial number of girls - Number of girls who joined the school.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of girls currently in school = 732 - 682 = 50 girls.  Therefore, there are 50 girls currently in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys and 135 girls in school. So, the total number of students was 214 + 135 = 349. Now, 496 girls and 910 boys entered the school. Therefore, the new number of boys is 910 - 214 = 706.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in school. If we add these numbers together, we get 626 students in total. However, we also know that there are 36 teachers at this school. So, if we divide the number of students by the number of teachers, we can find out how many students each teacher is responsible for teaching. In this case, each teacher is responsible for teaching approximately 17 students (626 / 36 = 17).
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to find out how many teachers are in school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in school. So, the ratio of students to teachers is 624:772 = 1:1. Therefore, there is one teacher for every student in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 402 girls and 739 students in total, then the number of boys must be less than 739 - 402 = 337. Therefore, there are 337 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 458 boys and 692 girls, then the number of boys is less than half of the total number of students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of boys = x/2 Where x is the total number of students (i.e., 458 + 692). Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we can use cross-multiplication or substitution methods. Using cross-multiplication method, we get: x = (x/2) × 2 = 1196 Since x/2 = 1196, we have x = 2392. Therefore, there are 2392 students in this school, including both boys and girls.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys in school and 257 girls. When 403 girls joined the school, we need to find out how many more girls than boys there are now. So, let X be the number of extra girls. According to the problem, the total number of students in the school is 362 + 257 = 619. Therefore, X = 619 - 362 = 257. Thus, there are 257 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $18 dollars and he spent $16 dollars. So, his remaining amount of money is: $18 - $16 = $2 dollars. Therefore, Edward has $2 dollars left now.
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, Edward spent $10.
Response:  Edward had $9 initially and then spent $8 more than that, so he spent a total of $9 + $8 = $17. Therefore, Edward had $9 - $8 = $1 less than he started with before spending any money.
Response:  We know that Edward had $16 to buy books and he spent it all. So, he has $0 left now.  Before spending money on books, Edward had $X dollars. Since he spent all his money, X = $16. Therefore, Edward had $16 before buying the books.
Response:  We know that Edward had $6 to buy two books and each book cost him an equal amount of money. So, he spent $6 / 2 = $3 on each book. Now he has $12. Therefore, each book cost him $3.
Response:  Edward had $6 for books and $16 for pencils, so he had a total of $22 ($6 + $16). Now he has $19, so we can subtract $3 from his original amount to find out how much he spent on books: $22 - $3 = $19. Therefore, Edward spent $19 on books before he spent any money on pencils.
Response:  Edward had $4 for books and $3 for pens. So he spent a total of $7 (4 + 3). Now he has $12. Therefore, Edward spent $5 on books and $5 on pens ($12 - $7 = $5 + $5).
Response:  If Edward had $16 for books and spent $8 on pears, then he had $16 - $8 = $8 left after buying the pears. Now, he has $19, so he must have spent $9 (or $9 / $8) more than he had left earlier on books. Therefore, Edward spent $9 + $8 = $17 on books.
Response:  Before he received $10 from his friend, Edward had $17. So after receiving $10, he had $27 ($17 + $10). Now he has $7, so he must have spent $20 ($27 - $7). Therefore, Edward spent $20 before he received the $10 from his friend.
Response:  Zachary did 44 clicks on the exercise bike and David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if they together performed x push-ups, then we can write an equation as follows:  Zachary's number of push-ups = 44 David's number of push-ups - Zachary's number of push-ups = 58 - 44 = 14 Therefore, Zachary and David together performed 14 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in an hour at the gym and David did 44 push-ups in the same time frame. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did:  Number of push-ups done by Zachary - Number of push-ups done by David = Difference between their numbers of push-ups  In this case, the difference between their numbers of push-ups is: 51 - 44 = 7  So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David did 44 clicks on the exercise bike and Zachary did more than 9 push-ups. So we can say that Zachary did at least 9 + 44 = 53 push-ups.
Response:  David did 51 push-ups at the gym. Zachary did 49 more push-ups than David. So, Zachary did 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups together with David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 kickboxing moves and 44 drops. So he did a total of 103 movements (59 + 44 = 103). Now we are told that David did more than Zachary in terms of push-ups. This means that David did at least 103 - 19 = 84 push-ups. Therefore, David did 84 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches in one hour of fitness ability.  David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary (i.e., 29 - 44 = -15). However, David did fewer crunches than Zachary (-13). So, if we subtract the number of crunches David did from the time he spent exercising, we get: Time spent exercising by David = Time spent exercising by Zachary + Number of crunches done by David - Number of crunches done by Zachary. Substituting the values given in the problem, we have: Time spent exercising by David = 60 minutes + 17 - 13 = 80 minutes. Therefore, David stlapsed for 80 minutes.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches in one hour of fitness ability.  David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary but fewer crunches. So we can write an equation based on this information:  Push-ups: Zachary = 53; David = 67 (more than Zachary) Crunches: Zachary = 14; David = 26 (fewer than Zachary) Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for Zachary's push-ups and crunches, we get:  Push-ups: Zachary = 53 / 2 = 26.5 push-ups per hour Crunches: Zachary = 14 / 2 = 7 crunches per hour Based on these calculations, Zachary performed 26.5 push-ups and 7 crunches per hour of fitness ability."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 pull-ups and 3 squats per hour of physical fitness training.  David performed 58 more push-ups than Zachary but 87 fewer crunches than Zachary. So we can say that Zachary performed x push-ups and y crunches, where x > y. Now we need to find out how many more push-ups Zachary performed than David. To do this, we will divide the number of push-ups Zachary performed (x) by the number of push-ups David performed (58). This gives us: x / 58 = 2. Therefore, Zachary performed 2 times as many push-ups as David. Similarly, we can find out how many fewer crunches Zachary performed than David by dividing the number of crunches Zachary performed (y) by the number of crunches David performed (87): y / 87 = 0.64. Therefore, Zachary performed 64% as many crunches as David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 pull-ups and 58 push-ups. So, he did more pull-ups than push-ups.  Now we need to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David. To do this, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did:  Number of push-ups Zachary did - Number of push-ups David did = 58 - 38 = 20  Therefore, Zachary did 20 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups and David did more than Zachary. So, we can say that David did at least 19 + 1 = 20 push-ups. Since John did fewer push-ups than David, we can say that John did 20 - 13 = 7 push-ups. Therefore, David did 20 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups at PE class. David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Since John did 4 fewer push-ups than David, John did 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John did 69 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups more than David. So, if David did 39 push-ups, then Zachary did 54 push-ups (39 + 15 = 54). Now we know that John did 9 fewer push-ups than David. So, if David did 39 push-ups, then John did 20 push-ups (39 - 9 = 20). Therefore, Zachary did 54 push-ups more than John.
Response:  If David made 30 more throws than Zachary in an hour of tossing, that means Zachary threw 30 times less than David. So if David threw 37 times, then Zachary threw 37 x (1/3) = 12 times.
Response:  David made 56 more clicks than Zachary during the hour of astronomical ability. If David made 38 clicks together with Zachary, then Zachary made 18 clicks (56 - 38 = 18).
Response:  David did 40 sit-ups in 1 minute, which means he did 40/60 = 0.67 sit-ups per second.  Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches in 1 hour, which means he did 34/60 = 0.57 push-ups per second and 62/60 = 1.04 crunches per second. So, David did more sit-ups than Zachary did push-ups and crunches combined.
Response:  David did 36 push-ups in one minute less than Zachary, who did 58 push-ups in an hour. So if Zachary did 58 push-ups in one hour, then he did 10 more push-ups than David did in one minute. Therefore, David did 36 / 10 = 3.6 push-ups per minute.
Response:  We know that David did 27 push-ups and 7 fewer crunches than Zachary in an hour of telokvika (a fictional sport). So, if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 more crunches than David, then we can say that Zachary did: Push-ups: 5 + 17 = 22 Crunches: 27 - 7 = 20 Therefore, Zachary did 22 push-ups and 20 crunches more than David.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 5 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages of homework in reading. So, we can write this as:

Mathematics: 5 pages
Reading: 2 pages

Now, let's compare these two quantities:

Mathematics > Reading (by 3 pages)

So, Rachel completed more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading. The difference between the two is 3 pages."
Response:  Rachel has to complete 3 pages of homework in mathematics and 4 pages of homework in reading. So, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 3 + 4 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had more pages of reading homework than mathematics homework.
Response:  Rachel had to complete 5 math homework pages and still had more reading homework pages to finish. If she completed 7 total homework pages, then she must have completed at least 2 reading homework pages. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Rachel completed 7 homework pages in mathematics and she had to complete more than 4 pages from reading, then we can assume that she completed 4 + x pages of reading homework, where x is the number of additional pages she had to complete beyond 4. So, the total number of homework pages Rachel had to complete is 7 + x. Therefore, the answer is 7 + x.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 pages of homework in mathematics and she had to complete more than 3 pages beyond reading, then we can assume that she completed 5 pages (8 - 3 = 5) of homework beyond just reading. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 5 + 3 = 8 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 math homework assignments, that means she had to complete 8 - 6 = 2 more homework assignments than math problems. So, Rachel had to complete 2 x 6 = 12 homework assignments in total. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 10 pages of homework in mathematics and she completed 3 pages more than required for mathematics, then she had to complete 7 pages of homework in mathematics. So, the answer is 7.
Response:  Rachel has to complete 2 pages of homework in mathematics, 3 pages of homework in reading comprehension, and 10 additional pages of homework in biology. Therefore, she needs to write a total of 15 pages (2 + 3 + 10 = 15).
"Response:  We know that Rachel completed 9 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages of homework in reading. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Mathematics = 9 + x Reading = 2 Where ""x"" is the number of pages of homework that Rachel did not complete in mathematics. Now, we are given that Rachel completed 96 additional pages of homework in biology. So, we can add this to her total number of pages completed in both subjects: Mathematics = 9 + x Reading = 2 Biology = 96 Total =? To find out how many pages Rachel completed in mathematics, we need to subtract the number of pages she did not complete from the total number of pages she completed: Total - (Mathematics - x) = 96 Substituting the values we have obtained so far, we get: 96 - (9 + x) = 96 Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 74 Therefore, Rachel completed 74 pages of homework in mathematics more than she did in reading."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 11 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages in reading comprehension. We are not given the number of pages she completed in biology. Therefore, we can conclude that Rachel completed more pages of homework in mathematics than in biology. Specifically, she completed 11 pages in mathematics and 2 pages in reading comprehension, for a total of 13 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages she completed in mathematics and biology is 13 - 3 = 10 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 7 homework pages from mathematics, 11 homework pages from reading, and additional 8 homework pages from biology. So, in total she needs to complete 7 + 11 + 8 = 26 homework pages. Since we were told that she completed more pages from reading than from biology, we can conclude that she completed more than 8 pages from reading and less than or equal to 8 pages from biology. Therefore, the number of homework pages from reading that Rachel completed is greater than 8, but less than or equal to 19 (since there are only 11 pages left after subtracting the 8 pages from biology).
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 9 homework pages from mathematics and 11 homework pages from reading. So, she needs to complete 9 + 11 = 20 homework pages in total. However, we are also given that there are 29 additional homework pages from biology, so Rachel needs to complete 20 + 29 = 49 homework pages in total. Therefore, the answer is 49.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of homework from mathematics and 7 pages from reading comprehension. Therefore, she needs to complete 8 + 7 = 15 pages of homework in total. However, we are also given that she has to complete additional 3 pages of homework from biology, so she needs to complete 15 + 3 = 18 pages of homework in total.
Response:  Rachel has to complete 5 pages of homework in mathematics, and each page contains 2 problems. Therefore, she needs to solve 10 problems in total.  In addition, she has to complete 10 pages of homework in reading comprehension, which means she needs to read and understand 10 passages of text. Finally, she has to complete 6 pages of homework in biology, with each page containing 3 problems. So, in total, Rachel needs to solve 18 problems in biology.  Therefore, the final answer is:  Mathematics - 5 pages x 2 problems/page = 10 problems Biology - 6 pages x 3 problems/page = 18 problems Reading Comprehension - 10 pages
Response:  Rachel has to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of homework from mathematics. So, in total she has to complete 6 pages (2 + 4).
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 4 pages of reading for her homework in mathematics and 19 additional pages in biology. So, the total number of pages she completed is: 4 + 19 = 23 pages. Therefore, there are 23 more pages in her homework from mathematics than from reading.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails early and 2 more later. So he received in total 6 + 2 = 8 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon.
Response:  At 8 am, Jack received 8 emails.  At noon, he received another 6 emails. So in total, Jack received 14 emails (8 + 6). Therefore, Jack received more than 8 emails after noon.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and then he received additional 1 email later that day, so altogether he received 5 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 5 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails after lunch, and 5 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and then he deleted some of them. He also received 40 more emails during the day. So, the total number of emails Jack received is:  5 + (40 - 7) = 48 emails. Therefore, Jack received 48 emails in one day.
Response:  Jack did 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails after lunch. So he did a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now, we are told that he did 8 emails in the evening. Therefore, the number of emails Jack did in the evening is 8 - 9 = -1. So, Jack did -1 email in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails early in the morning and 4 emails after that. So he received a total of 7 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). Then, he received another 5 emails in the evening, making it a total of 12 emails for the day. Therefore, Jack received 12 emails during the day.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning, which means he received 3 more emails than in the evening (since there are 7 fewer hours between the two times). So, Jack received 10 + 3 = 13 emails in total during the daytime.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in the morning and lost 2 emails during the day (he sent 7 emails). So he had 9 - 2 = 7 emails left at night.
Response:  Jack did not receive any emails in the morning (he received 0 emails), he received 5 emails after lunchtime and 4 emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails Jack received is: 0 + 5 + 4 = 9. Therefore, Jack received more emails during the day than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails after lunch, and a few more in the evening. So he received a total of 10 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 1 email every 2 hours (10/6 = 1.67).
Response:  At first, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. Then he received 5 more emails and 54 more letters. So in total, Jack received 3 + 5 = 8 emails and 64 + 54 = 118 letters during the day. Therefore, Jack received 8 emails and 118 letters during the day.
Response:  At first, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in total (5 + 6 = 11). Then he received 9 more emails and 7 more letters later in the day (9 + 7 = 16). So, in total, Jack received 11 + 16 = 27 items during the day.
Response:  At first, Jack received 10 emails and 12 lists in the morning. Then he received 3 more emails and 44 more lists later in the day. So, the total number of emails Jack received is:  10 + 3 = 13 emails. The total number of lists Jack received is:  12 + 44 = 56 lists. Therefore, Jack received more than 50 emails and lists combined that day.
Response:  At first, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. Then he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails and 8 + 7 = 15 letters. Therefore, Jack received more than 15 letters than populous.
Response:  At first, Jack sent 6 emails and then he received 2 emails. So, in total, Jack sent 6 + 2 = 8 emails that day.
Response:  Jack sent 4 emails in the morning and then he received 6 emails. So far, Jack has sent + received = 10 emails. Then, he sent 8 more emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack sent a total of 10 + 8 = 18 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in total during the day. He received 7 emails before noon and an additional 2 emails after noon. So, he received a total of 7 + 2 = 9 emails during the day.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 8 emails (3 + 5 = 8). Therefore, Jack received more than 10 emails in the morning.
Response:  If he received 3 emails in the morning, that means he received 3 x 2 = 6 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). And if he also received some more emails in the evening, let's say another 4 emails, then he received a total of 6 + 4 = 10 emails for the day. So, Jack received 10 emails in one day.
Response:  We know that košilec (kobylka) jumped 9 palcs and ŽABA (žaba) jumped 12 palcs. So we can write it as follows:  Distance = 9 + 12 = 21 palcs. Therefore, ŽABA is 21 palcs away from KOŠILEC.
Response:  We know that košilec (K) and žaba (Z) jumped together. The distance traveled by košilec is given as 31 palců (p), and the distance traveled by żaba is given as 35 p. Since they jumped together, we can write an equation based on this information: K + Z = 31 + 35 =?. Solving for K + Z gives us: K + Z = 66. So, košilec and żaba jumped together a total of 66 palců (p).
"Response:  We know that Kozmetka (the cat) jumped 36 palců (palces are equal to 12 cm). Then, we have three jumps: 
* The frog jumped 17 palců further than Kobylka (the mole). This means that the frog jumped 17 + 12 = 29 cm.
* Myš (the mouse) jumped 15 palců further than Žaba (the frog). So, Myš jumped 15 + 12 = 27 cm.
* Therefore, the distance traveled by Žaba is 29 - 27 = 2 cm."
Response:  We know that Kozmetka (the cat) jumped 25 cm, Žaba (the frog) jumped 18 cm further than Kobylka (the toad), and Myš (the mouse) jumped 2 cm less than Žaba. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = 25 + (18 - 2) = 45 cm. Therefore, Myš jumped 45 cm away from her starting point.
Response:  We know that: * The frog jumped 10 cm further than the mouse. * The mouse jumped 20 cm further than the kitten. So we can write an equation: Distance = (Mouse distance + Frog distance) - Kitten distance Distance = (20 + 10) - x Where x is the distance the kitten jumped. Now we are given that the kitten jumped 19 cm. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: Distance = (20 + 10) - 19 Distance = 31 cm Therefore, the mouse jumped 31 cm away from the kitten.
Response:  We know that: * The frog jumped 39 palms further than the mouse. * The mole skidded 94 palms less than the mouse. So we can write an equation: Distance = (Mouse distance) - (Mole distance) Distance = 94 - x Where x is the distance traveled by the mole. Since we are given that the mole skidded 94 palms less than the mouse, we can substitute this value in the equation: Distance = 94 - x Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use the information provided in the problem: * The frog jumped 39 palms further than the mouse. * The mole skidded 94 palms less than the mouse. So we can write another equation: Frog distance = Mouse distance + Mole distance Frog distance = x + 94 Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: x + 94 = 94 - x Solving for x, we get: x = 0 Therefore, the mole skidded 94 palms less than the mouse, which means it traveled 94 palms closer to the starting point than the mouse did.
Response:  We know that Kozmetka (the cat) jumped 25 cm, Žaba (the frog) jumped 32 cm further than Kobylka (the mouse), and Myš (the mouse) jumped 26 cm less than Žaba. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = 25 + (32 - 26) = 73 cm. Therefore, Myš jumped 73 cm away from where she started.
Response:  We know that Kozmetka (the cat) jumped 24 cm, Žaba (the frog) jumped 33 cm further than Kobylka (the mouse), and Myš (the mouse) jumped 5 cm less than Žaba. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = 24 + (33 - 5) = 60 cm. Therefore, Myš is 60 cm away from Kobylka.
"Response:  We know that Kosilec jumped 13 palms and Kobylek jumped 5 cm further than Kobylek. So, if we call the distance that Kobylek jumped x, then we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 5 = 13
Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem into this equation:
x + 5 = 13
Substituting x = 5 (since Kobylek jumped 5 cm), we get:
5 + 5 = 13
Simplifying, we have:
10 = 13
So, the distance that Žaba jumped is 10 cm."
Response:  We know that Kosilec jumped 35 centimeters and Kobylek jumped 10 centimeters further than Kosilec. So, in total, Kobylek jumped 45 centimeters (35 + 10). Therefore, they jumped together 20 centimeters (45 / 2 = 20).
Response:  We know that Káliq skočil o 19 palcove (which is equal to 94.78 cm).  We also know that Káliq skočil o 10 cm more than Žaba and Myš skočily together. So, if we subtract 10 cm from 94.78 cm, we get 84.78 cm. Therefore, Žaba skočila o 84.78 cm.
Response:  We know that Kralik jumped 39 centimeters and Žaba jumped 19 centimeters further than Kralik. So, Žaba jumped 58 centimeters (39 + 19). Myš jumped less than Žaba by 12 centimeters. Therefore, Myš jumped 46 centimeters (58 - 12).
Response:  We know that Kralik jumped 21 centimeters and Žaba jumped 25 centimeters further than Kralik. So, Žaba jumped 46 centimeters (25 - 21 = 16 + 21). Myš also jumped less than Žaba, but we don't know how much. Therefore, Kobylka jumped 46 centimeters minus Myš's distance.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 centimeters and the snake moved 17 centimeters. So we can calculate how far away from each other they are now using distance = speed x time. In this case, the speed of the frog is 39 / 1 = 39 cm/cm and the speed of the snake is 17 / 2 = 8.5 cm/cm (since it moved half as much). Now we just need to multiply the distance traveled by their speeds: Distance between them = 39 x 39 = 1461 cm + 8.5 x 17 = 1479 cm. Therefore, the distance between the frog and the snake is approximately 1479 cm or 1479 meters.
"Response:  We know that: * The frog jumped 20 cm farther than the mouse. * The mouse jumped 10 cm less than the frog. * The mole (or toad) jumped 30 cm farther than the mouse. So we can write an equation based on these statements: Distance = Frog + (Mouse - Mouse distance) + Mole distance Where ""Distance"" is the total distance traveled by each animal in centimeters. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: * For the frog: Distance = 20 cm + (Myš distance - Žabova distance) + Kobylecova distance = 20 + (-10 + 30) = 40 cm * For the mouse: Distance = Myš distance = 10 cm * For the mole (or toad): Distance = Mole distance = 30 cm Substituting these values into the equation above and simplifying gives us: 40 = 10 + 30 = 60 cm Therefore, the mouse traveled 60 cm in its jump."
"Response:  We know that:
Kozmetka = 14 paces (palců)
Žaba = 37 paces (palců) less than Kobylka (kobylka = 51 paces)
Myš = 16 paces (palců) less than Žaba
So, we can calculate how many paces (palců) myš skočila from kobylka as follows:
Distance traveled by myš = Distance traveled by Žaba - Distance traveled by kobylka
= 16 paces (palců) - 37 paces (palců)
= -21 paces (palců)
Since myš skočila in the opposite direction of kobylka, the distance she traveled is negative. Therefore, myš skočila away from kobylka by 21 paces (palců)."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 spoons of flour (múka) and needs to add more. To find out how many spoons she needs to add, we can use the information given in the problem: The recipe requires 14 spoons of flour and 6 spoons of sugar. Since Mary has already added 5 spoons of flour, she still needs to add 9 spoons of flour (14 - 5 = 9). So, Mary needs to add 9 spoons of flour more.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tablespoons of flour to make 9 cups of dough (which is equal to 360 grams). To make 11 cups of dough, she needs an additional amount of flour that is equal to 8 cups minus the amount she has already added (i.e., 11 - 4 = 7 cups). So, we need to add 7 x 360 = 2520 grams of flour to the mixture. Therefore, the answer is 2520 grams.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given away some of the flour and sugar. To find out how much she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has given away from the total amount needed. So, if she needs 8 more schalks of flour than she gave away (since she gave away 6 schalks), then she needs 2 more schalks of flour. Similarly, since she needs 13 more schalks of sugar than she gave away (she gave away 4 schalks), then she needs 9 more schalks of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 2 schalks of flour and 9 schalks of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour (11/5 = 4) and 7 cups of sugar (7/5 = 4). So she needs an additional 3 cups of flour (2 - 4 = 3) and 3 cups of sugar (2 - 4 = 3).
Response:  We know that the recipe required 11 cups of sugar and we used 3 cups so far. To find out how many more cups are needed, we can divide the total amount of sugar required by the amount of sugar we have already used: 11 cups / 3 cups = 3 + 11 = 14 cups. So, we need to add 6 more cups of sugar to the mixture.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already given away some of the flour and sugar. To find out how many spoons of flour she needs to give away in order to have exactly 2 spoons left, we can use the following equation: Number of spoons of flour needed = Total number of spoons of flour - Number of spoons of flour given away So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of spoons of flour needed = 12 + 5 - x = 17 Where ""x"" is the number of spoons of flour that Mary has already given away. Since Mary gave away 3 spoons of flour (as stated in the question), we can plug this value into the equation as follows: Number of spoons of flour needed = 12 + 5 - 3 = 16 Therefore, Mary needs to give away 3 more spoons of flour in order to have exactly 2 spoons left."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to make 9 batches of Kolache. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has already used from the total amount needed for all 9 batches. So, the number of cups of flour left to be added is: 9 - 3 = 6 cups. Similarly, since we know that each batch requires 5 cups of sugar, we can calculate the number of cups of sugar left to be added as follows: 62 / 5 = 12.4 cups (round up to nearest whole number). Therefore, Mary still needs to add 12 cups of sugar to complete all 9 batches of Kolache.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 spoons of flour and 2 spoons of sugar to make the dough. To find out how many spoons of sugar she still needs to add, we can use the information given in the problem: The recipe calls for 14 spoons of sugar, and Mary has already used 10 spoons. So, to find out how many spoons of sugar Mary still needs to add, we subtract the number of spoons she has already used (10) from the total amount needed (14): 14 - 10 = 4. Therefore, Mary still needs to add 4 spoons of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 spoons of flour to make 12 batches of dough (since she needs 12 x 5 = 60 spoons of dough). So we need to find out how many spoons of flour are left after adding 11 spoons. To do this, we can subtract the number of spoons Mary has already added from the total amount needed: 60 - 11 = 49. Therefore, Mary still needs 49 spoons of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 spoons of flour (šálky múky) and she needs to add more to make 10 spoons (šálky múky). So, we can subtract 7 from 10 to find out how many spoons of flour are needed: 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more spoons of flour to make 10 spoons in total. Now, let's check if this is correct by comparing it with the information given in the question: According to the question, Mary needs to mix 10 spoons of flour (šálky múky), 2 spoons of sugar (šálky cukru), and 80 spoons of salt (šálok soli). If we divide the amount of salt by the number of spoons of flour, we get: 80 / 10 = 8. So, Mary needs to add 8 more spoons of flour than she has already added to make 10 spoons in total. But we just calculated that she needs to add 3 more spoons of flour! This means that our calculation was incorrect, and Mary actually needs to add 5 more spoons of flour to make 10 spoons in total: 10 - 7 = 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of flour (since she ran out). So we have to find out how much more flour is needed.  The recipe says that for every 14 tablespoons of sugar, you need 7 tablespoons of flour. Since Mary used 2 tablespoons so far, she needs 12 tablespoons more (14 - 2 = 12). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 12 tablespoons of flour.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 spoons of flour (since she said ""Už do naj dala 5 šálok múky""). Now we need to find out how many spoons of sugar and salt are needed. According to the recipe, for every 4 spoons of flour, you need 1 spoon of sugar and 1/2 spoon of salt. So if Mary has already added 5 spoons of flour, then she needs:

Sugar: 5 × 1 = 5 spoons Sugar Salt: 5 × 1/2 = 2 1/2 spoons Salt

Therefore, Mary needs an additional 3 spoons of sugar and 1 1/2 spoons of salt to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of sugar and she needs to add more. To find out how much more, we can use the information given in the question. The recipe calls for 13 tablespoons of sugar, and Mary has already used 2 tablespoons. So, we need to subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount needed.  Subtracting 2 from 13 gives us 11. Therefore, Mary still needs 11 tablespoons of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tablespoons of sugar and needs to add more to make 9 tablespoons in total. So, we can start with the difference between 9 and 6 (the amount of sugar she currently has), which is 3 tablespoons. Then, we need to divide this number by the number of tablespoons Mary wants to add each time (in this case, 4): 3 / 4 = 0.75. Therefore, Mary needs to add 0.75 tablespoons of sugar at a time until she reaches her goal of 9 tablespoons.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of flour (múka) to the dough and she needs more than 6 tablespoons of sugar (cukr). So we can calculate how much more sugar is needed using the following formula: Number of additional tablespoons = Total amount required - Amount already added. In this case, the total amount of sugar required is 9 tablespoons (since there are 9 tablespoons in a third), and Mary has already added 2 tablespoons, so the number of additional tablespoons needed is: Number of additional tablespoons = 9 - 2 = 7 tablespoons. Therefore, Mary needs 7 more tablespoons of sugar than she currently has.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 schalks of flour and needs to add more sugar than flour. So we can start with the given information: 

* Number of schalks of flour = 11
* Ratio of sugar to flour = 5:14 (according to the recipe)

We want to find out how many schalks of sugar Mary needs to add. To do this, we can use the ratio of sugar to flour as a proportion. Since there are 5 schalks of flour for every 14 schalks of sugar, we can set up the following proportion:

Schalks of sugar / Schalks of flour = 5/14

Now, we know that Mary has already added 11 schalks of flour, so she needs to add:

Number of schalks of sugar needed = Total number of schalks of flour - Number of schalks of flour already added
= 14 x (5/14) - 11
= 7 + 3
= 10

Therefore, Mary needs to add 10 schalks of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some amount of flour and sugar to make the Kolache. The ratio of flour to sugar is 3:1, so for every 3 parts of flour, there is 1 part of sugar. Therefore, if Mary needs an additional 5 parts of flour, she will need 5 x 3 = 15 parts of sugar. Since we are given that Mary has already added 10 parts of flour, she has only 5 parts of flour left to add (15 - 10 = 5). So, Mary needs 5 more parts of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some amount of flour to make the dough. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour. If she has already added some flour, then we can deduce that she has used at least some of the flour required in the recipe. So, let's assume that she has used all 13 cups of flour. Now, if she needs 12 more cups of flour to complete the dough, then she will need an additional 1 cup of flour beyond what she has already used. Therefore, the answer is 1 cup.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 tablespoons of flour and 6 tablespoons of sugar. To find out how many tablespoons of flour she still needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required (14 tablespoons). So, Mary still needs to add 7 tablespoons of flour. Similarly, to find out how many tablespoons of sugar she still needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added (6 tablespoons) from the total amount required (60 tablespoons). So, Mary still needs to add 54 tablespoons of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary added 12 tablespoons of flour and 10 tablespoons of sugar to make the Kolache recipe.  Since she already has 10 tablespoons of sugar, she needs an additional 2 tablespoons (10 + 2 = 12) more sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 tablespoons of flour (múka) to make the dough. To find out how many more tablespoons she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Number of tablespoons needed = Total amount of sugar - Amount of sugar already used / Total amount of flour

In this case, the total amount of sugar is 3 cups (3 × 10 = 30), and the amount of sugar already used is 2 cups (6 × 10 = 60). So, we need to subtract these two amounts:

Number of tablespoons needed = 30 - 60 = -30

Since it cannot be negative, we know that Mary needs to add 30 tablespoons of flour more to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. Since we have already added 4 cups of flour, we need to add an additional 10 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5). Therefore, we need 5 more cups of flour than we have. Similarly, since the recipe requires 40 cups of salt and we have already added 4 cups, we need to add an additional 36 cups of salt (40 - 4 = 36). So, we need 36 more cups of salt than we have. Now let's calculate how many cups of each ingredient are needed in total: Total amount of sugar required = 9 cups + 36 cups = 45 cups Total amount of flour required = 14 cups + 5 cups = 19 cups Total amount of salt required = 40 cups + 36 cups = 76 cups In conclusion, we need 76 cups of salt and 19 cups of flour more than what is currently available.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar and 7 cups of flour in total. Since we have already added 2 cups of flour, we need to add 5 more cups (7 - 2 = 5). So, we need 5 + 9 = 14 cups of flour. Now, let's calculate how much salt is needed. We know that for every cup of flour, we need 4 teaspoons of salt. Therefore, if we want to make 14 cups of Kolache, we will need 14 x 4 = 56 teaspoons of salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 tablespoons of melted butter (múka) to the dough, and we want to find out how many more tablespoons of sugar she needs to add to get the right amount according to the recipe.  The recipe calls for 11 tablespoons of sugar, so if Mary has already added 12 tablespoons of múka, then she needs to subtract 12 from 11 to find out how many additional tablespoons of sugar she needs. Therefore, the answer is 9 tablespoons of sugar.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tablespoons of sugar and the recipe calls for 7 tablespoons in total. So we need to find out how many tablespoons are left to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (7 tablespoons) by the amount of sugar Mary has already added (4 tablespoons):

7 - 4 = 3

So, there are 3 tablespoons of sugar still needed to be added."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 spoons of sugar and needs to add more to make 12 spoons in total. So, we can start with the given information as follows:

Mary has already added 10 spoons of sugar (which is equal to 1/3 of the required amount).
To find out how many spoons of flour she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount of sugar needed (i.e., 12 - 10 = 2).
So, Mary needs to add 2 spoons of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  If 60 families of birds migrated away from the mountain during winter and only 19 families remained, then the number of families that stayed behind is equal to 60 - 19 = 41.
Response:  If 7 families of birds migrate to warmer climates during winter and there are currently 87 families living near the mountain, then we can assume that before migration, the total number of bird families in the area was 87 + 7 = 94. Therefore, after 7 families have left for warmer climates, there will be 94 - 7 = 87 remaining families of birds in the area.
Response:  We know that 20 families of birds migrated away from the mountain for winter and only 14 families remained. So, initially there were 20 + 14 = 34 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 23 families of birds left for Africa and 37 families left for Asia. So, in total, 23 + 37 = 60 families of birds left their homes near the mountain. Therefore, there are 85 - 60 = 25 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 42 rodins of birds migrated to Africa and 31 rods of birds migrated to Asia. So, we have:

Number of birds that migrated to Africa = 42
Number of birds that migrated to Asia = 31
Now, let's find out how many more birds migrated to Africa than to Asia:
More birds migrated to Africa = Number of birds that migrated to Africa - Number of birds that migrated to Asia
= 42 - 31
= 11
So, there are 11 more birds that migrated to Africa than to Asia."
"Response:  We know that 47 families of birds migrated to Africa and 94 families migrated to Asia. So, we have:

Number of families that migrated to Africa = 47
Number of families that migrated to Asia = 94
Now, let's find out how many more families migrated to Asia than to Africa:
More families migrated to Asia = Number of families in Asia - Number of families in Africa
= 94 - 47
= 47
So, there are 47 more families that migrated to Asia than to Africa."
Response:  We know that almost all animals migrate to warmer climates during winter and around the mountain there are 18 families of birds. If 38 families of birds went to Africa and 80 families went to Asia, how many families of birds went to other places? So, the answer is 42 (38 + 80 - 18).
Response:  If there are currently 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 18 new families arrive, then the total number of bird families living nearby will be: 87 + 18 = 105 families.
Response:  We know that 59 rodín (families) of birds migrated away from the mountain and 24 new families settled in the area near the mountain from the Arctic region. So, the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is:  59 - 24 = 35 families.
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds migrated from near the mountain to warmer climates. If there were originally 41 families of birds living near the mountain, then we can calculate how many families remained by subtracting the number of families that migrated from the original total. So, the answer is 41 - 27 = 14 families of birds remain near the mountain after migration.
Response:  We know that 86 families of birds migrated away from their mountain home for winter. If there were initially 45 families living near the mountain, then how many more families migrated away before those who remained? So, the answer is 41 (86 - 45).
"Response:  We know that 35 families of birds migrated to Asia and 62 families migrated to Africa. So, we have:

Migrated to Asia = 35
Migrated to Africa = 62

Now, let's find out how many families remained in Europe:

Families remaining in Europe = Total number of families - Migrated to Asia + Migrated to Africa
= 41 - 35 + 62
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 families of birds remaining in Europe."
Response:  We know that there are three families of birds living near the mountain and 26 new families have migrated from the Arctic to the area nearby. So, the total number of bird families in the area is: 3 + 26 = 29. Therefore, there are 29 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  Paul had 253 pencils at the beginning of the school year and either lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, he had 183 pencils left at the end of the school year (253 - 70 = 183).
Response:  Paul had 308 pencils at birthdays and gave or sold 551 of them until the end of the school year, leaving him with 177 pencils. So he received 223 pencils (308 - 551) for his birthday.
Response:  Paul had 440 pastries and gave away 111 to his friends. So he has 329 left (440 - 111 = 329). Then he lost 106 ceramics. So he has 223 left (329 - 106 = 223).
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 213 pencils during the school year and lost/gave away 16 of them. So, we have to find out how many he had at first. Let's assume he started with x pencils. Then, after giving away 213 pencils, he had x - 16 = 207 pencils left. Now, we are told that there were 65 different colors among his pencils. So, if he had 207 pencils in total, then each pencil was used an average of 65 / 207 = 0.3 times (or approximately once every three pencils). Therefore, the number of colored pencils he had is 207 x 0.3 = 62.
Response:  Paul gave away 589 pencils during the school year and lost 161 of them. So he had 428 pencils left. He then gave away 571 more pencils to his friends, which means he has given away a total of 1099 pencils (428 + 571). Therefore, he still has 391 pencils left (1099 - 391 = 391).
Response:  Paul gave away 110 colored pencils to his friends during the school year and lost 412 pencils in total. So he had 702 pencils at first (110 + 412). To find out how many more pencils he lost after giving some away, we need to subtract the number of pencils he gave away from the initial amount: 702 - 90 = 612. Therefore, Paul lost an additional 612 pencils after giving some away.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 pencils during the school year and lost 558 of them. So he has 332 pencils left. Now we want to find out how many pencils he got for his birthday. To do this, we can divide the number of pencils he has left (332) by the number of pencils he gave away during the school year (563): 332 / 563 = 0.601 or approximately 0.6. Therefore, Paul got 0.6 x 558 = 334 pencils for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 pencils during his school year and lost or gave away 535 pencils in total. So, if he had only 492 pencils left, we can calculate how many he lost or gave away as follows: Number of pencils lost/given away = Total number of pencils - Number of pencils left = 535 - 492 = 43 Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 43 pencils.
Response:  We know that Paul had 521 pastries and 66 pieces of gum at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school year, he was left with 154 items. So, we can calculate how many items were eaten or given away as follows: Number of items eaten = Total number of items - Remaining items = 521 - 154 = 367 items. Therefore, 367 pastries and 66 pieces of gum were either eaten or given away during the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul had 531 pastries and 38 pieces of gum at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school year, he was left with 391 pastries and no gum. So, we can calculate how many pastries and gum he had at the end of the school year as follows: Pastries: 391 - 531 = -140 pastries Gum: 38 + (-140) = 178 pieces of gum Therefore, Paul had 178 pieces of gum at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul had 601 pastries and 406 gummies at the beginning of the school year. If he did not lose any gummi bears, then he must have eaten 205 gummy bears (406 - 201 = 205). Now we need to find out how many more gummy bears he ate than pastries. So, let X be the number of gummy bears he ate beyond pastries. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of gummy bears eaten = Pastries + X (given)  Number of gummy bears left = 336 (found)  Subtracting the number of gummy bears left from the total number of gummy bears eaten gives us the number of gummy bears Paul ate beyond pastries: X = 336 - 205 = 131. Therefore, Paul ate 131 more gummy bears than pastries.
"Response:  We know that Paul got 291 candies at the end of the school year, and he lost or gave away 315 candies during the year. So, we can calculate how many candies he had at birthday as follows:

Total number of candies = Number of candies received at birthday - Number of candies lost or given away
= 291 - 315
= -124

So, Paul did not receive any candy for his birthday."
Response:  Paul gave away 267 pencils during his birthday party and spent 231 of them himself. So he has 36 pencils left (267 - 231 = 36). Now, let's find out how many more pencils he gave away to his friends after he had given away 308 pencils in total. We know that he gave away 308 pencils, so we can subtract this number from the total amount of pencils he gave away to find out how many more he gave away to his friends: 36 - 308 = -272. Therefore, Paul gave away -272 pencils to his friends after giving away 308 pencils in total.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 457 gumballs and 320 erasers. At the end of the school year, he was left with 523 objects in total (gumballs + erasers). Since he didn't lose any gumballs or erasers during the year, we can conclude that he gained 523 - 457 = 66 more gumballs and erasers than he initially had. So, the final number of gumballs is 457 + 66 = 523, and the final number of erasers is 320.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 11 customers and then some left (but we don't know how many). So, let X be the number of customers who left. Then, we have:

Number of customers remaining = 11 - X

We also know that after they left, there were still 3 customers in the café. So, we can write:

X + 3 = 11

Solving for X, we get:

X = 8

So, 8 customers left the café."
Response:  We have 3 customers initially. When some of them left, we had 4 customers remaining. So, the number of customers who remained is greater than the number of customers who left. Therefore, the answer is 5 (the difference between the initial number and the final number).
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers. If 9 - 1 = 8 customers left, then at the beginning there were 8 customers.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 14 customers and then 5 remained. So, we can calculate the number of remaining customers as follows:

Number of remaining customers = Initial number of customers - Number of customers who left
= 14 - 5
= 9

Therefore, there are 9 customers left in the café."
Response:  At first, Čašník had 13 customers. Then, some of them left (but we don't know how many). As a result, he gained 4 new customers. So, his total number of customers is: 13 - (number of customers who left) + 4 =.... Since he still has 9 customers, the number of customers who left must be equal to 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, Čašník now has 13 - 5 = 8 customers.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 12 customers and 15 of them left. So, the number of remaining customers is:

12 - 15 = -3

Now, we have 14 new customers coming in. So, the updated number of customers is:

-3 + 14 = 11

Therefore, the number of customers who are still at the café is 11."
Response:  The first customer came and there were 3 customers in total (including the first one). Then, 4 more customers arrived, making it 7 customers in total (including the original 3 + the new ones). So, the number of new customers who came is 7 - 3 = 4.
Response:  At first, there were 8 customers. Then some of them left, so there were 5 remaining customers. After that, 9 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers was: 8 + 5 = 13.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Then some of them left, so there were 14 customers remaining. After that, he gained 10 new customers, so now he has 24 customers in total.
Response:  If Dan has $3 left after buying chocolate for $2, then he had $5 to start with ($3 - $2 = $5). So, he had $5 at the beginning.
Response:  If Dan has $4 and spends $3 on chocolate, then he has $1 left. So, the cost of the chocolate is $3.
"Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 99 chocolate sticks for $3. So, we can write an equation as follows:

$4 = x + (99 \* $3)

where x is the amount of money left with Dan after buying the chocolate sticks.

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract $3 from both sides of the equation:

$$4 - ($3) = x$$

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation gives us:

$$4 - $3 = x$$

Solving for x, we get:

x = $1

So, Dan had $1 left after buying the chocolate sticks."
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for 2 chocolate sticks, so he paid $4/2 = $2 per stick. Therefore, each stick cost $2.
Response:  If Dan has $2 and buys some chocolate for $6, then he spent $6 - $2 = $4. Since each piece of chocolate costs $3, he bought $\frac{4}{3}$ pieces of chocolate. So, Dan bought $\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$ pieces of chocolate.
Response:  If Dan has $7 and buys chocolate for $2, he will have $5 left ($7 - $2 = $5). Then, if he buys another piece of chocolate for $3, he will have $2 left ($5 - $3 = $2). So, the amount of money that remained with him is $2.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $7 for the chocolate stick and $6 for the chocolate bar, so he spent in total $13 ($7 + $6). Therefore, he spent $13 - $4 = $9 for the chocolate and $4 for other things (like taxes or service charge). So, he spent $9 for the chocolate.
Response:  The cost of chocolate is $3 and the cost of the stick is $6. So, if he bought both, he spent $3 + $6 = $9. Therefore, he spent $9 for the chocolate stick and $3 for the chocolate, so in total, he spent $12.
Response:  He spent $2 for chocolate and $3 for the stick, so he spent in total $2 + $3 = $5. Therefore, he spent $5 for the chocolate and $1 for the stick.
"Response: 
Dan had $4 initially. He bought a chocolate stick for $8, so he spent $8 - $4 = $4. Now he has $4 - $5 = $-1 left. So, he has no money left."
Response:  At first, Dan had $4. Then he spent $3 on chocolate stick. So, his remaining amount of money is: $4 - $3 = $1. Therefore, the cost of the chocolate stick was $3.
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for something and then spent $3 on chocolate sticks. So he has $4 - $3 = $1 left. Therefore, there are $1 / $0.01 = 100 penny pieces left.
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for 2 chocolate sticks, so he paid $4 / 2 = $2 per stick. Therefore, each stick cost $2.
Response:  Dan spent $3 for chocolate and $7 for a stick of chocolate. So he spent in total $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent $10 for the chocolate stick and $10 / 2 = $5 for the chocolate.
Response:  Dan has $4 and spends $7 for chocolate and $2 for a stick of chocolate. So he spent in total $9. Therefore, he spent $9 / $4 = $2.25 for the chocolate and $2.25 + $2 = $4.25 for the stick of chocolate.
Response:  We know that Paul sold 78 books at a discount and had 115 books left. So, he has 37 books remaining (115 - 78 = 37).
Response:  We know that after he sold 137 books at a discount of $2 each, he had $264 in revenue ($137 x $2). Then, he gave $105 to charity. So, his remaining amount is $159 ($264 - $105). Therefore, he started with 159 books.
Response:  Paul had 108 books in total and gave away some of them at a garage sale. He gave 35 books to his friend and ended up with 62 books left. So, he must have given away X books = 108 - (35 + 62) = 71 books.
Response:  We know that Paul has 50 books and after buying some of them in a garage sale, he got 151 books left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of books Paul had = 50. After buying some books in a garage sale, number of books Paul got = 151 - x, where x is the number of books Paul bought in the garage sale. Now, we need to find out how many books Paul bought in the garage sale. Let's assume that he bought x books. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: Number of books Paul had + Number of books Paul bought = 151. Simplifying the equation, we get: 50 + x = 151. Solving for x, we get: x = 101. Therefore, Paul bought 101 books in the garage sale.
Response:  If he sold 2 books and then bought 150 new ones, that means he has 150 - 2 = 148 new books now. Then, if he currently has 58 books, it means he must have sold some of his old books to make room for the new ones. So, let's calculate how many books he sold: Number of old books = Total number of books - Number of new books = 148 - 2 = 146 books. Therefore, he sold 146 books.
Response:  If he sold 21 books and then bought 42 new ones, that means he has 42 - 21 = 21 more books than he originally had. So, if he had 15 books left after selling some of them, it means he must have started with at least 36 books (21 + 15).
Response:  If he sold 71 books and bought 38 new ones, then he had 71 - 38 = 33 books left after selling some of his old books. So, he bought more than he sold. Therefore, the number of books he bought is greater than 33, but less than or equal to 71 (the total number of books he had). The difference between these two numbers gives us the exact number of books he bought: 33 < x < 71.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 108 books and 55 years. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 years. So, we can calculate how many books he sold as follows: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Remaining number of books = 108 - 66 = 42 books Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially, Paul had 51 books and 106 pairs of glasses. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he was left with 82 books and 14 pairs of glasses. To find out how many pairs of glasses Paul sold at the garage sale, we can use the following equation: Number of pairs of glasses sold = Total number of pairs of glasses - Remaining number of pairs of glasses after the sale So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of pairs of glasses sold = 106 - 14 = 92 pairs of glasses Therefore, Paul sold 92 pairs of glasses at the garage sale.
"Response:  If Paul had initially 136 books and he gave away some of them to leave with 27 books in his garage sale, then we can calculate how many books he gave away as follows:

Number of books given away = Total number of books - Number of books left after garage sale
= 136 - 27
= 109

Therefore, Paul gave away 109 books during the garage sale."
Response:  Paul had 134 books and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, he sold some of them in a garage sale and got $20 for each book. Therefore, he made $20 x 68 = $1360 from the garage sale. This means that he sold 68 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 95 books and 153 pens. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Books = Initial books - Sold books Pens = Initial pens - Sold pens Now, let's solve for the number of books sold at the garage sale:  Books sold = Total books - Number of books left With the information given in the question, we can plug in the values: Books sold = 95 - 13 = 82 books were sold at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pavol had 42 books and after selling them he got 143 new ones. So, his total number of books is: 42 + 143 = 185 books. Now we are told that after selling some of these books, he was left with 113 books. Therefore, the number of books he sold is: 185 - 113 = 72 books. Finally, we are also given that he sold 19 periods. So, the number of periods he sold is: 72 / 19 = 3.66 periods. Since you can't sell a fraction of a period, we round up to the nearest whole number which gives us 4 periods. Therefore, Pavol sold 4 periods on that day.
Response:  Jessica removed 8 raspberries from her garden and put them in the container. So, there are now 2 (10 - 8) raspberries left in the container. Therefore, there are 2 raspberries in the container.
Response:  We know that Jessica removed 16 roses from her garden and put them in the vase. So initially there were 23 - 16 = 7 roses in the vase.
Response:  Jessica threw away 4 roses and planted new ones in their garden to add them to the vase. So there are now 23 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica picked, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away (4) from the total number of roses in the vase (23). Therefore, Jessica picked 19 roses.
Response:  Jessica threw away 33 roses and then planted new ones in her garden to add to the vase. So, there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she planted than she threw away, we can subtract the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase: 17 - 33 = -16. Therefore, Jessica planted 16 more roses than she threw away.
Response:  Jessica threw away 34 roses and then picked new ones from her garden to put in the vase. So there are now 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she picked than she threw away, we can subtract the number of roses thrown away (34) from the total number of roses in the vase (15): 34 - 15 = 19. Therefore, Jessica picked 19 more roses than she threw away.
Response:  We know that Jessica removed more roses from her garden, which had initially contained 59 roses. Now, there are only 20 roses left in the garden. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica took away as follows: Number of roses taken away = Total number of roses - Current number of roses = 59 - 20 = 39 roses. Therefore, Jessica took away 39 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that Jessica removed 5 more roses from her garden, which had initially contained 12 roses. So, after she removed those 5 roses, there were 7 roses left in the garden (12 - 5 = 7). Now, we are told that the total number of roses in the garden is 21. Therefore, the number of roses that remained in the garden after Jessica removed 5 more roses is 21 - 7 = 14 roses.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in Jessica's garden. After she picked some of them, there were 17 roses and 96 orchids left in the garden. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica picked as follows: Number of roses picked = Initial number of roses - Final number of roses = 15 - 17 = -2 Roses. Therefore, Jessica picked -2 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 roses and 2 orchids in Jessica's garden. After she picked some roses and orchids, there were 10 roses and 21 orchids left in the garden. So, we can calculate how many orchids Jessica picked as follows: Number of orchids = Total number of orchids - Remaining number of orchids = 21 - 2 = 19 orchids Therefore, Jessica picked 19 orchids from her garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the garden.  After Jessica removed some of them, there were 12 roses and 2 orchids left in the garden. So, if we subtract the number of orchids from the total number of flowers, we get: Number of roses = Total number of flowers - Number of orchids = 12 + 2 = 14 Roses are therefore more than orchids by 14-2=12.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the garden. After Jessica removed some of them, there were 11 roses and 20 orchids left. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of orchids = Original number of orchids - Number of orchids removed
= 12 -?

We are asked to find out how many orchids Jessica removed. To do this, we need to subtract the number of orchids she removed from the original number of orchids. In this case, Jessica removed 5 orchids (12 - 5 = 7). Therefore, the answer is:

Orchids = 7
Roses = 11"
Response:  If she had 19 roses in the vase and gave away 3 of them, then there were initially 3 times as many roses in the vase (i.e., 3 x 19 = 57). So, she must have picked 57 roses from her garden to put into the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in Jessica's garden. After she picked some of them, there were 91 orchids and 14 roses left. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica picked as follows: Number of roses = Initial number of roses - Final number of roses = 13 - 14 = -1 rose Therefore, Jessica picked -1 rose.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in Jessica's garden. After Jessica removed some of them, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses left. To find out how many orchids Jessica removed, we can subtract the number of orchids after from the number of orchids before: 7 - 3 = 4 orchids. So, Jessica removed 4 orchids from her garden.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the garden. After Jessica removed some of them, there were 21 orchids and 22 roses left in the garden. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of roses initially in the garden (i.e., before Jessica removed any). Since there are now 22 roses in the garden, we can say that x - 6 = 22.

Similarly, let y be the number of orchids initially in the garden (i.e., before Jessica removed any). Since there are now 21 orchids in the garden, we can say that y - 20 = 21.

Now, we have two equations:

x - 6 = 22... (1)
y - 20 = 21... (2)

We want to find out how many more roses than orchids Jessica removed. To do this, we can subtract the value of y from the value of x:

x - y = 22 - 21 = 1

So, Jessica removed one rose more than she removed orchids."
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in Jessica's garden. After Jessica removed some of them, there were 13 orchids and 3 roses left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of orchids = 13 Number of roses = 3 Now, let's find out how many more orchids are there than roses: Difference between number of orchids and number of roses = 13 - 3 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 more orchids than roses in Jessica's garden.
"Response:  We know that she had 17 cm long hair and cut off 2-3 cm (not sure about the exact amount). So now she has 13 cm long hair. To find out how many grams of hair she lost, we need to divide the length of her new hair by the original length.  Therefore, the number of grams of hair she lost is:

$$ \frac{13}{17} = \boxed{\text{X}} $$

Where X is the number of grams of hair she lost."
Response:  Before she cut her hair, it was 20 cm long (20 palcove). Now, after cutting, it is 10 cm long (10 palcove). So, the difference in length is 10 - 20 = -10 cm or -10 palcove.
Response:  At first, her hair was 16 cm long and then it grew by 12 cm. So, now her hair is 16 + 12 = 28 cm long.
Response:  If there were originally 19 hairs and they grew by 18 hairs, then now there are 37 hairs (19 + 18).
Response:  If Robin had originally 14-inch long hair and now she has only 13 inches left, then her hair is shorter by 1 inch compared to its original length. So, the difference between the original and current lengths of her hair is 1 inch = 2.54 cm.
Response:  At first, Robin had 14 centimeters long hair. Then she cut it to 8 centimeters. After that, she trimmed off 20 centimeters. So now her hair is... (calculate)  Answer:  Based on the information provided in the question, Robin's hair length after cutting and trimming is: 14 + 8 = 22 cm - 20 = 2 cm = 20 cm.
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 balls in his basket and he threw away 53 balls in the park. So, we can calculate how many balls Danny has left as follows: Number of balls Danny has = Total number of balls - Number of balls thrown away Total number of balls = 12 balls = 53 balls - 53 balls = 0 balls Danny does not have any balls left. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 balls in his basket and he threw more than two balls in the park. So, we can assume that he threw at least 3 balls in the park (since he had 21 balls and threw more than 2). Therefore, the number of balls Danny threw in the park is equal to 3 + 2 = 5. Now, we are asked how many balls Danny threw in the park. Since he threw 5 balls in the park, the correct answer is 53 - 5 = 48.
Response:  At first, Danny had 63 umbrellas in his collection. Then he gave away 51 old ones and now he has 33 left. So, to find out how many umbrellas Danny had at the beginning, we can subtract the number of umbrellas he gave away from the total number of umbrellas he had: 63 - 51 = 12. Therefore, Danny had 12 umbrellas at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 umbrellas in the park and then threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 umbrellas left in his bag now. To find out how many more umbrellas Danny collected than the ones he threw away, we can subtract the number of umbrellas he threw away from the total number of umbrellas he collected:  Number of additional umbrellas = Total number of umbrellas collected - Number of umbrellas thrown away  In this case, the total number of umbrellas collected was 36, and the number of umbrellas thrown away was 35, so:  Additional umbrellas = 36 - 35 = 1  Therefore, Danny collected 1 more umbrella than the ones he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 old coins in the park and then threw away 63 old coins. So, he had 42 coins left in his collection after throwing away those coins. Now, we are asked how many more coins Danny threw away than the ones he collected in the park. To find this difference, we can subtract the number of coins he collected from the number of coins he threw away:  Number of coins thrown away = 63 - 30 = 33 coins. Therefore, Danny threw away 33 additional coins beyond the ones he collected in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 umbrellas and 8 bags in the park. Now he has 28 umbrellas and 63 bags in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 22 + 8 = 30 items in total.
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 umbrellas and 30 bags in the park. Then he collected 17 more umbrellas and 57 more bags. So, initially, Danny had 22 + 17 = 39 umbrellas and 30 + 57 = 87 bags. Therefore, initially, Danny had 39 umbrellas and 87 bags.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 umbrellas and 14 bags in the park. So, initially he had 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection. Now, he has 7 more umbrellas and 86 more bags, so his new total is 44 + 7 = 51 umbrellas and 86 + 86 = 172 bags. Therefore, Danny collected 7 more umbrellas than bags in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 11 flyers and 28 leaves in the park. So he had 39 items (11 + 28) before he started collecting more. Now he has 68 flyers and 51 leaves, so he collected 29 more flyers (68 - 39 = 29) and 23 more leaves (51 - 28 = 23). Therefore, Danny collected 29 more flyers than leaves in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 71 umbrellas and 24 bags in the park initially. Now he has 28 umbrellas and 16 bags in his collection. So, the difference between the initial number of umbrellas and the current number is 28 - 71 = -43. Similarly, the difference between the initial number of bags and the current number is 16 - 24 = -8. Therefore, Danny currently has -43 umbrellas and -8 bags more than he had initially.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 10 flyers and 62 leaves in the park initially. So, his collection consisted of 10 + 62 = 72 items. Now, he has added 27 more flyers and 43 more leaves to his collection, so his new collection consists of 72 + 27 = 99 flyers and 43 + 43 = 86 leaves. Therefore, Danny has 86 more leaves than flyers now.
Response:  At first, Danny had 25 umbrellas in his collection. Then, he found 66 more umbrellas in the park. So, now he has 91 umbrellas (25 + 66). Therefore, the answer is 91.
Response:  We know that Danny has 32 fliers in his collection and he found 25 of them in the park. So, we can calculate the number of fliers left in the park as follows: Number of fliers left in the park = Total number of fliers - Number of fliers found in the park = 32 - 25 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 fliers left in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 0 uzávery (fliaš). Then he collected 60 old umbrellas in the park and threw away 58 of them. Now he has 67 uzávery in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 0 uzávery.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 6 old umbrellas in the park and then threw 50 new ones. Now he has 60 umbrellas in his collection. To find out how many more umbrellas Danny threw than the ones he collected, we can subtract the number of old umbrellas he collected from the total number of new umbrellas he threw:  Number of additional umbrellas = Total number of new umbrellas - Number of old umbrellas collected = 50 - 6 = 44 Therefore, Danny threw 44 additional umbrellas in the park after collecting the 6 old ones.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 old umbrellas in the park and then threw away 48 of them, leaving him with 52 new umbrellas. To find out how many more umbrellas Danny threw away than those he put back in his collection, we can subtract the number of umbrellas he threw away from the number of umbrellas he had after collecting new ones:  Number of additional umbrellas thrown away = Total number of umbrellas thrown away - Total number of umbrellas left in collection = 54 - 52 = 2 Therefore, Danny threw away 2 more umbrellas than he put back in his collection.
Response:  At first, Danny had 82 balloons and 29 uninflated balls in the park. Then he collected 42 inflated balls and 61 balloons from the park. So, initially, Danny had 29 + 42 = 71 objects in total.
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 flyers and 39 umbrellas in the park. Then he collected 16 more flyers and 68 more umbrellas. So, initially, Danny had 66 + 39 = 105 objects (flyers + umbrellas) in total. Now he has 16 + 68 = 84 objects left in his collection. Therefore, initially, Danny had 105 - 84 = 21 objects (flyers + umbrellas) in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 fly boxes and 50 fly leaves in the park. Now he has 21 fly boxes and 52 fly leaves in his collection. To find out how many more fly boxes than leaflets Danny collected, we can subtract the number of fly boxes from the total number of items he collected:  Number of fly boxes = Total number of items - Number of fly leaves  Number of fly boxes = 50 - 46 = 4  So, Danny collected 4 more fly boxes than fly leaves in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 65 flakes and 5 snowballs in the park. Now he has 31 snowballs and 9 flakes in his bag. To find out how many more snowballs than flakes Danny collected, we can subtract the number of flakes from the total number of objects he collected:  Number of snowballs = Total number of objects - Number of flakes  Number of snowballs = 65 - 5 = 60 So, Danny collected 60 more snowballs than flakes in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 58 fly balls and 25 baseballs in the park. Now he has 11 baseballs and 12 fly balls in his collection. So, we can calculate how many more fly balls Danny has now as follows: Number of additional fly balls = Total number of fly balls - Initial number of fly balls in collection = 12 + 25 = 37 Therefore, Danny has 37 more fly balls than he had initially.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 15 flyers and 18 balls in the park. So initially he had 67 balls + 35 flyers = 102 objects in his collection. Now he has 67 balls more than flyers, so he has 67 + 35 = 102 objects in his collection now. Therefore, Danny has 102 - 35 = 67 more balls than flyers in his collection now.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer brothers than Steven. So if Jake has 17 brothers, then Steven must have 28 brothers.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskies than Steven. So, if Jake has x broskies, then Steven has x + 14 broskies. Since Steven has more broskies than Jake, we can say that Jake has x < 14. Now, we are given that Steven has 15 broskies, so we can set up an equation: x + 14 = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 1. Therefore, Jake has 1 brosky.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer books than Steven, who has more books than Jill. So, we can start with Jake and subtract his number of books from Steven's to find out how many books Jill has.  Books owned by Jake = 18 Books owned by Steven = 19 - 18 = 1 Books owned by Jill =? Therefore, Jill has 1 book.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven, who has more apples than Jill. So, we can start with Jake and work our way up.  Jake has 3 apples, Steven has 8 apples more than Jake, so Steven has 3 + 8 = 11 apples.  Now, we know that Jill has fewer apples than Steven, so she has 11 - 2 = 9 apples. Therefore, Jake has more apples than Jill by 9 - 3 = 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer books than Steven, who has 11 more books than Jill. So, if we subtract the number of books that Steven has from Jake's total, we will get the number of books that Jill has. Therefore, Jill has 12 - (11 + 4) = 8 more books than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskys than Steven and more broskys than Jill. So, we can start with Jake's number of broskys being between Steven's and Jill's numbers.  Let's assume Jake has x broskys. Since Steven has 16 broskys, we know that x is less than or equal to 16. Also, since Jill has 9 broskys, we know that x is greater than or equal to 9. Therefore, the range of possible values for Jake's number of broskys is between 9 and 16 (inclusive).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskys than Steven and more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x broskys, where x is between 7 and 17 (inclusive). Since Jill has 17 broskys, we can set up an equation as follows:

Jake + Jill = 2x

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 2(17) - 2 = 34

So, Jake has 34 broskys."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more apples than Jill. So, if we compare Jake to Steven, Jake has 9 - 16 = -7 apples less than Steven. And if we compare Jake to Jill, Jake has 9 - 13 = 6 apples more than Jill. Therefore, Steven has more apples than Jill by 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more broskyn than Jake and Jill together have 5 less broskyn than Steven. So we can write an equation as follows:  Jake = (Steven - 18) + 5  Now let's solve for Jake's number of broskyn:  Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us:  Jake = 37  Therefore, Jake has 37 broskyn.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskies than Steven (Jake has 5 less). So, if Steven has x broskies, then Jake has x - 5 broskies.  Now we are told that Steven has 18 more broskies than Jill. So, if Jill has y broskies, then Steven has y + 18 broskies.  Finally, we are told that Jill has 87 broskies. Therefore, Jake has how many broskies more than Jill? To find out, we can subtract Jill's number of broskies from Steven's number of broskies: Steven has 18 more broskies than Jill, so Steven has y + 18 = 87 broskies. Since Jake has 5 less than Steven, Jake has y + 18 - 5 = 32 broskies more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has 15 more books than Jake and Jill has 12 less books than Jake. So, if Jake has x books, then Steven has x + 15 books. Therefore, Jill has x - 12 books. Now we can find out how many books Jill has by subtracting 12 from x: x = 30. So, Jake has 30 books, Steven has 45 books (x + 15), and Jill has 28 books (x - 12).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskys than Steven. So, we can start with Jake's number of broskys and subtract the difference between their numbers to find out how many broskys Jake has.  Therefore, Jake has 12 - (19 - 79) = 12 - 60 = -48 broskys.  Since negative numbers are not valid for broskys, we can conclude that Jake does not have any broskys.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more pears than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of apples from both numbers, we will get the number of pears that Jake has.  Therefore, Jake has 3 more pears than Steven.  So, Jake has 3 + 8 = 11 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steven and 8 more jackets than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples and y jackets, then Jake has x - 6 apples and y + 8 jackets. Since Jake has less apples than Steven, we can say that x > 16 (the number of apples Steven has). Also, since Jake has more jackets than Steven, we can say that y > 8. Now, we need to find out how many persimmons Steven has more than Jake. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem: x > 16 and y > 8. Solving for x, we get x = 24. Therefore, Steven has 24 persimmons more than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer broskyn than Steven and 10 more jabłk than Steven. So, if Jake has x broskyn and y jabłk, then Steven has x + 3 broskyn and y - 10 jabłk. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 3 = y - 10... (1)

We also know that Jake has 12 broskyn and 15 jabłk in total. Therefore, the total number of broskyn and jabłk that Steven has is equal to the total number of broskyn and jabłk that Jake has plus the difference between their numbers:

x + 3 + 12 = y - 10 + 15... (2)

Now we can solve for y (the number of jabłk that Steven has):

y = x + 3 + 12... (3)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get:

x + 3 + 12 = y - 10 + 15

Simplifying and solving for x (the number of broskyn that Jake has), we get:

3 = x

So Jake has 3 broskyn. As for Steven, he has 15 jabłk more than Jake, which means he has 18 jabłk in total (15 + 3)."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 brothers and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, we can say that Jake has x brothers where x is less than 12. Now, we are told that Jake has 4 fewer brothers than Steven, so we can write an equation as follows:  Jake has x = 12 - 4 = 8 brothers. Therefore, Jake has 8 brothers.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 cookies and Jake has fewer than 18 cookies. So, Jake must have at least 10 cookies (since he cannot have more than 18). Now we are given that Jill has fewer cookies than Jake, so Jill has at most 10 cookies. Therefore, Jill has exactly 9 cookies.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 birds and Jake has fewer than 19 birds. So, we can say that Jake has x birds, where x is less than or equal to 19. Also, we know that Jill has 72 more birds than Jake. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake has x birds, and Jill has x + 72 birds. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  Now, we have an equation with only one variable, x:  Solving for x, we get:  Therefore, Jake has 14 birds.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 birds and Jake has fewer than 14 birds. So, Jake must have at least 7 birds (since he cannot have more than 14). Therefore, Jill has 3 birds less than Jake, which means she has 3 + 7 = 10 birds.
Response:  We know that Steven has 13 broskyň and 52 jabĺk, so he has a total of 65 points (13 + 52). Now we are told that Jake has 84 jabĺk more than Steven. So, Jake has 84 + 65 = 149 points. Therefore, Jake has 149 broskyň.
Response:  We know that Steven has 8 brosky and 12 jabkl. So he has in total 8 + 12 = 20 fruits. Now we are told that Jake has more than 13 jabkl but less than 17. This means that Jake has between 13 and 17 jabkl inclusive. Since there is no number between 13 and 17 that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder (e.g., 14 / 2 = 7 with a remainder of 1), we must conclude that Jake has exactly 15 jabkl. Therefore, the answer to the question is 15.
Response:  We know that Steven has 11 jacks and 18 blocks. So he has a total of 11 + 18 = 39 pieces. Now we are asked how many more pears than jacks Steven has. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of jacks from the total number of pieces. Therefore, the answer is: 39 - 11 = 28 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 apples and 15 pears. So, he has more apples than pears. Now, we are asked how many apples Steven has more than pears. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pears from the total number of fruits that Steven has. Therefore, the answer is:  Steve has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than pears.
Response:  The change given in the store was $15. So, Olivia had $78 - $15 = $63 left as change.
Response:  We know that $Olivia$ spent $78$ dollars at the supermarket and she had originally $45$ dollars. So, we can calculate the change as follows: $\text {Change} = \text{Spent amount - Original amount} = 78 - 45 = 33$. Therefore, Olivia had $33$ dollars in change.
Response:  The initial amount of money was $100. Then she withdrew another $148 from the ATM. After visiting the supermarket, she had $159 left. So, the total amount she spent is: $148 + $159 = $297. Therefore, she spent $297 - $100 = $197.
Response:  The initial amount of money in Olivia's purse was $3.  When she withdrew $49 from the ATM, her new balance became $52 ($3 + $49). After visiting the supermarket and spending $49, her remaining balance was $6 ($52 - $49 = $6). So, Olivia gained $6 more than what she spent at the supermarket.
Response:  The total amount of money that Olivia had was $53. She withdrew an additional $91 from the ATM. So, her new total amount of money is $144 ($53 + $91). Then she spent $14 at the supermarket, leaving her with $130 ($144 - $14). Therefore, Olivia spent more than she gained at the ATM.
Response:  The total amount of money she had was $106. After visiting the supermarket and an exhibition hall, she spent $26 at the supermarket. If she spent $49 in the showroom, how much did she spend in the supermarket? So, the answer is $26.
Response:  If Olivia spent $29 at the supermarket and she had $54 in her wallet initially, then she must have spent some amount less than $54 - $29 = $25. So, $25 was the amount that Olivia spent.
Response:  If she had $38 in her wallet and spent it all at the store, then she has zero dollars left. So, the amount of money she has left is $0 - $38 = -$38.
Response:  If Dave has 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 applications left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  At first, Dave had 18 applications on his phone. After he deleted 18 of them, he was left with 5. So, initially, Dave had 18 applications on his phone.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications on his phone initially and then he added 11 new ones. So, the total number of applications on his phone after adding the new ones is:

10 + 11 = 21

Now, we are asked how many applications Dave deleted. The question states that after deleting some applications, he was left with 4 applications. Therefore, the number of applications Dave deleted is:

21 - 4 = 17

So, Dave deleted 17 applications from his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave added 89 new applications and had 21 applications before deleting some of them. So, he had 21 + 89 = 106 applications in total after adding all the new ones. Then, we are told that after deleting some of them, he was left with 24 applications. Therefore, the number of additional applications (i.e., the difference between the total number of applications after adding all the new ones and the number of applications left after deleting some) is: 106 - 24 = 82.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially and added 71 new ones. After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. To find out how many more applications he deleted before adding any new ones, we can subtract the number of remaining applications (14) from the total number of applications he had after adding new ones (71). So, the answer is: 71 - 14 = 57. Therefore, Dave deleted 57 additional applications before adding any new ones.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 5 applications and 23 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of applications before deletion = Number of applications after deletion + Number of applications deleted. In this case, the number of applications before deletion is equal to 16 (as given in the problem statement). Substituting this value into the above equation, we get: 16 - x = 5 + 77 - x Where 'x' represents the number of applications Dave deleted. Solving for 'x', we get: x = 9 Therefore, Dave deleted 9 applications.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 3 applications and 7 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of applications = 3 Number of files = 7 Now, let's analyze the information given in the question: Before deleting any applications or files, Dave had 17 applications and 21 files. Therefore, we can write another equation: Number of applications before deletion = 17 Number of files before deletion = 21 To find out how many files Dave deleted, we need to subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the total number of files he had before deleting: Number of files deleted = Number of files after deletion - Number of files before deletion Substituting the values we have obtained earlier, we get: Number of files deleted = 7 - 21 = -14 Therefore, Dave deleted 14 files.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 21 applications and 4 files left. So, to find out how many more applications and files he has, we can subtract the number of applications and files he had after deleting some from the total number he had initially:

Number of additional applications = Total initial apps - Apps remaining after deletion = 15 - 21 = -6

Number of additional files = Total initial files - Files remaining after deletion = 24 - 4 = 20

So, Dave has 6 fewer applications and 20 fewer files on his phone than he initially had."
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 6 applications and 15 files left on his phone. Now we want to find out how many more files he has compared to applications. Since there are 15 files remaining, each file represents 3 applications (since there were originally 19 applications). So, the number of additional files is equal to the number of applications minus the number of files already found = 3 - 15 = -12. Therefore, Dave has 12 more applications than files on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications on his phone and then added one more (application number 18), that means he now has 18 applications on his phone. So, the correct answer is 18.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 12 applications and 30 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of applications before deletion = 12 (given) Number of applications after deletion = x ( unknown ) From the problem statement, we know that Dave deleted 5 applications. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation as follows: Number of applications after deletion = 12 - 5 = 7 Now, let's find out how many files were deleted. According to the problem statement, Dave had 30 files left after deleting some applications and files. So, we can write another equation as follows: Number of files after deletion = 30 (given) Number of files after deletion = x ( unknown ) Since we already have one equation for the number of applications, we can use it again to find the number of files deleted. Substituting the value from the first equation into the second equation gives us: Number of files after deletion = 30 - (Number of applications after deletion / Total number of applications before deletion) Number of files after deletion = 30 - (7 / 15) Number of files after deletion = 30 - 0.46 Number of files after deletion = 29.54 Therefore, Dave deleted 29 files.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 17 applications and 21 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of files = 21. Now, let's find out how many files Dave deleted. To do this, we need to subtract the number of files he had before deleting from the total number of files he had after deleting: Number of files he deleted = 21 - 17 = 4. Therefore, Dave deleted 4 files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, to find out how many more applications and files he has now, we can subtract the number of applications and files he had after deleting some from the total number he had initially. Therefore, the answer is: Number of additional applications = Total number of applications - (Number of applications after deletion) = 12 - 3 = 9 Number of additional files = Total number of files - (Number of files after deletion) = 5 - 3 = 2 Therefore, Dave has 9 additional applications and 2 additional files on his phone.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 24 files and 2 applications left on his phone. So, initially he had $X$ applications and $Y$ files. Since he deleted some of them, we can write: $$ X - 3 = 24 \text{ and } Y - 11 = 3 $$ Now, let's solve for $X$ and $Y$: $$ X - 3 = 24 \Rightarrow X = 27 \text{ or } X = 30 $$ Similarly, to find $Y$, we have: $$ Y - 11 = 3 \Rightarrow Y = 8 \text{ or } Y = 10 $$ Therefore, Dave has $27$ applications and $8$ files left on his phone.
Response:  We know that Nell has 242 baseball cards in total and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate the number of cards Nell has left as follows: Number of cards Nell has = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 242 - 136 = 106 Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.
Response:  At first, Nell had 301 baseball cards. Then she gave 301 of them to Jeff and now he has 154 left. So, initially Nell had 301 + 301 = 602 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, we can calculate how many cards Nell gave to Jeff as follows: Number of cards given by Nell to Jeff = Total number of cards owned by Nell - Number of cards left with Nell = 528 - 252 = 276 cards. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards.
Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has fewer cards now - let's say x. So, we know that x + 234 = 566 (since Jeff started with 0). Now, if Nell took some of her cards back from Jeff, she would have x - 535 =? (since he now has 535 cards). Solving for x, we get x = 197. Therefore, Jeff has 197 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell has collected 309 baseball cards and 356 cards with decimals. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 decimal cards. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than 10, we can subtract 10 from the total number of baseball cards she has:  Number of baseball cards Nell has = Total number of baseball cards - 10  So, the answer is: Nell has more than 10 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell has collected some cards from Jeff and now she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card packs. So, the total number of cards Nell has is: 404 + 495 = 899 cards. Now, we are asked how many ten-card packs Nell has more than baseball cards. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards: 899 - 404 = 495 ten-card packs. Therefore, Nell has more than 495 ten-card packs.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards initially and gave 195 to John. So, she has 378 cards left. Now, we are told that she gave some more cards to Jeff, but not all of them (she still has 210 cards). Therefore, we can conclude that Nell gave Jeff at least 162 cards (210 - 48 = 162).
Response:  We know that Nell has collected 18 cards of type 10 and given some to Jeff. So, she now has 55 - 18 = 37 cards of type 10. Since each deck contains 10 cards, we can conclude that Nell has more than 37 decks of baseball cards. Therefore, the answer is greater than 37.
Response:  We know that Nell has collected 111 baseball cards and 38 cards of other types. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 376 cards in total (111 baseball cards + 265 non-baseball cards). Since Nell has more than 10 decks of cards, we can conclude that she must have at least 4 decks (376 / 10 = 4). So, the number of decks Nell has is 4.
Response:  Paco had 19 Kolacheks and gave away 16 of them. So he has 3 left. To find out how many he started with, we can divide the number of Kolacheks he gave away (16) by the number of Kolacheks he had at first (x). Therefore, x = 16 / 3 = 5. So, Paco started with 5 Kolacheks.
Response:  If Paco had 28 Kolacheks and he ate 21 of them (as stated in the question), then he has 7 left. So, the number of Kolacheks that Paco ate is equal to 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  Paco had 40 Kolacheks to start with and he ate 2 of them. So, now he has 40 - 2 = 38 Kolacheks left. Then, he bought another 37 Kolacheks. So, in total, Paco has 38 + 37 = 75 Kolacheks. Therefore, Paco has 75 Kolacheks left.
"Response: 
Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. Then he bought another 3 packs of biscuits. How many more biscuits did he eat than the ones he originally had?  We can represent this situation as follows: 
Original amount = 25 cookies
Amount eaten = 5 cookies
Additional amount = Number of biscuits bought - Amount eaten
= 3 packs x 10 biscuits/pack - 5 cookies
= 30 biscuits
So, Paco ate 30 additional biscuits beyond what he initially had."
Response:  Paco bought 13 Kolacheks and ate 2 of them. Then he bought 36 more Kolacheks. So, in total, Paco had 39 Kolacheks (13 + 36). Now, we need to find out how many more Kolacheks Paco bought after eating 2. To do this, we subtract the number of Kolacheks he ate from the total number of Kolacheks he bought: 39 - 2 = 37. Therefore, Paco bought 37 more Kolacheks after eating 2.
Response:  Paco had 40 cookies and gave 5 to his friend. So, he had 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Then, he gave 13 more cookies to his friends, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, Paco had 22 cookies in total.
Response:  Paco had 17 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So he has 3 left (17 - 14 = 3). Now, he gave more than he got from his friend, so he has 2 extra cookies (3 - 1 = 2). Therefore, Paco has 2 more cookies than he gave to his friend.
Response:  Paco made 12 Kolacheks and gave 16 to his friend. So he had 4 left (12 - 16 = 4). Then he gave 2 more to his friend, so now he has 2 left (4 - 2 = 2). Therefore, Paco gave his friend 3 more than he ate (16 - 12 = 3).
Response:  We know that Paco has 22 sweet and 75 salty crackers in total. He eats 15 sweet and 54 salty crackers. So, we can calculate how many sweet crackers Paco has left as follows: Number of sweet crackers = Total number of sweet crackers - Number of sweet crackers eaten = 22 - 15 = 7 Therefore, Paco has 7 sweet crackers left.
Response:  Sweet pastries (sladkych) = 9 x 12 = 108 pieces. Salted crackers (slanich) = 6 x 12 = 72 pieces. Total number of pieces = 108 + 72 = 180 pieces. So, Paco had 180 salted crackers.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 37 sweet and 11 salty crackers. If he ate 5 more sweet than salty, then we can say that he ate 37 - 11 = 26 sweet crackers and 11 + 5 = 16 salty crackers. So, there are 26 - 16 = 10 more sweet crackers than salty crackers.
"Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 8 sweet and 6 salty crackers. If he has eaten 20 sweet and 34 salty crackers in total, then we can calculate how many more salty than sweet crackers he has eaten as follows:

Total number of crackers eaten = 20 + 34 = 54

Number of salty crackers eaten = 6

Number of sweet crackers eaten = 20

So, the difference between the number of salty and sweet crackers eaten is:

Difference = Number of salty crackers - Number of sweet crackers = 6 - 20 = -14

Therefore, Paco has eaten more salty crackers than sweet crackers."
Response:  If Paco had originally 37 cookies and he gave 36 of them away, then he has 1 cookie left.
Response:  Paco had 36 Kolacheks and gave away 14 of them to his friend. So he has 22 left (36 - 14 = 22). Then he ate 10 of them, so he has 12 left (22 - 10 = 12). Therefore, Paco had 12 Kolacheks left.
Response:  Paco gave away 41 cookies and kept 9 for himself. He then shared 18 cookies with his friend. So, if he gave away more than he kept, that means he had more than 9 cookies left after sharing them with his friend. Therefore, the number of cookies he kept is less than or equal to 9. Hence, the correct answer is:  Paco kept fewer than 9 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 6 Kolacheks and gave 30 to his friend. He ate 23 himself. So, he gave his friend more than he ate. Therefore, the difference between the number of Kolacheks given to the friend and the number eaten is equal to the number of Kolacheks that Paco gave away minus the number he ate.  In other words, the answer is: 30 - 23 = 7.  So, Paco gave his friend 7 more Kolacheks than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco has 97 total colaçikes and he eats 15 of them which are sweet. So, we have to find out how many sweet colaçikes Paco had before he ate any of them. To do this, we can use the following equation: Total number of sweet colaçikes = Number of sweet colaçikes after eating - Number of sweet colaçikes before eating. In this case, the number of sweet colaçikes before eating is equal to 97 (total number of colaçikes) minus 15 (number of sweet colaçikes after eating). Therefore, the number of sweet colaçikes Paco had before eating is: 97 - 15 = 82. So, Paco had 82 sweet colaçikes before he started eating them.
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 total colaçikes (slaní and sweet). He ate 14 sweet ones, so he has X number of salted left. Since he ate 9 salted ones, we can write an equation: 26 = 14 + X. Solving for X, we get :X = 12. So, Paco had 12 salted colaçikes left.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 39 sweet and 6 salty crackers. If he has eaten 23 salty and 32 sweet crackers, then we can calculate how many more sweet crackers he has eaten as follows: Number of sweet crackers eaten = Total number of sweet crackers - Number of salty crackers eaten = 32 - 6 = 26 Therefore, Paco has eaten more than twice as many sweet crackers as he has eaten salty crackers.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 40 sweet and 25 salty crackers. After eating, he had 28 salty and 15 sweet crackers left. To find out how many more salty than sweet crackers he ate, we can subtract the number of salty crackers he had after eating from the total number of salty crackers he ate:  Number of salty crackers Paco ate = 40 - (28 + 15) = 40 - 43 = -3. So, Paco ate 3 fewer salty crackers than sweet crackers.
Response:  If she received $7 and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $\$5 - \$7 = \$2$.
Response:  If she spent $8 and has $6 left, that means she had $14 to start with ($8 + $6). So, her initial amount of money was $14.
Response:  First, she received $2 from her mother and then her father gave her $4 more. If she spent $3, she would have $1 left. So, she had $1 + $2 = $3 total amount of money at the end.
Response:  Firstly, she received $8 from her mother and then her father gave her an additional $5. If she spent $4, then she has $13 left with her ($8 + $5 - $4). So, she received more money from her mother than from her father.
Response:  The girl received $3 from her mother and then spent $4. So she has $3 - $4 = $ -$1 left. Now her father gave her $6 more, so she got $6 + ($- $1) = $5 more than what she had originally from her mother. Therefore, the amount of money the girl received from her father is $5 more than what she had originally from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, she received $5 from her father and then spent $4. So, she has $1 ($5 - $4) left from her father. Now, her mother gave her $7 more. So, she has $8 ($7 + $1) in total. Therefore, she received more money from her mother than from her father.
Response:  The father gave her $5 and the mother gave her $2, so she has a total of $7 from both parents. If she spends $6, then she will have $1 left from her parents. So, the answer is $1.
Response:  If Josh had 9 marbles and gave away some of them, he now has fewer than that number. So, if he has 4 marbles left, he must have given away at least 5 marbles (9 - 4 = 5). Therefore, Josh gave away 5 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had initially 21 gullickies and gave away 7 of them (as stated in the problem), then he has 21 - 7 = 14 gullickies left. Now, if he received 12 more gullickies, then he has 14 + 12 = 26 gullickies in total. So, the number of gullickies that Josh had in his collection originally is 26 - 14 = 12 gullickies.
Response:  We know that Josh had 19 gulichoks and gave away 11 of them. So he has 8 gulichoks left (19 - 11 = 8). Now, he found 5 new gulichoks. So, in total, Josh has 8 + 5 = 13 gulichoks now.
Response:  Josh had 4 marbles and lost some of them. He found 8 new ones. So he has now 4 + 8 = 12 marbles in total. Therefore, he lost more marbles than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had 7 gulicks and lost 8 of them. So he has 7 - 8 = -1 gulick left. Then, he found 10 new gulicks. So his final amount is +10 = 10 gulicks more than what he started with. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Josh has 21 marbles and he gave away 7 of them, then he has left with 21 - 7 = 14 marbles.
Response:  Josh had 20 gulicks at first and gave 2 to Jack. So he has fewer gulicks now. We can calculate how many he has left using subtraction:  Josh had 20 - 2 = 18 gulicks left.
Response:  Josh had 22 gulíčeks initially and Jack gave him 20 more. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 gulíčeks.
Response:  If Josh had 11 gollywog dolls before and he got one more, then he has 12 dollies now. So, the answer is 12.
Response:  Josh had 22 marbles and gave away 13 of them. So he has 9 marbles left (22 - 13 = 9).
Response:  We know that Josh collected 15 acorns and gave away 9 of them. So he has 6 acorns left (15 - 9 = 6). Now we are asked how many more acorns he gave away than he collected. To find this difference, we subtract the number of acorns he gave away from the number he collected: 6 (acorns given away) - 9 (acorns collected) = 3 (difference between giving away and collecting). Therefore, Josh gave away 3 more acorns than he collected.
Response:  Josh had 3 marbles and gave away 2 marbles, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 marble left. Then, he received 6 more marbles, so he now has 1 + 6 = 7 marbles in total. Therefore, Josh gained 7 - 5 = 2 marbles.
"Response:  The total weight of Marco's and his father's jahodies is equal to the sum of their weights. So we can write:
Weight of Marco's jahodies = Weight of his father's jahodies + Total weight of all jahodies
Substituting the given values, we get:
Weight of Marco's jahodies = 20 kg + (4 liby - 4 liby)
Simplifying, we get:
Weight of Marco's jahodies = 20 kg + 0 kg
Therefore, Marco's jahodies are twice as heavy as his father's jahodies."
Response:  The total weight of all jahodies collected by both Marco and his father is given as 35 libra (lb).  Marco's jahodies weigh 13 kilogram (kg), which is equal to 29 lb. So, if we subtract the weight of Marco's jahodies from the total weight of jahodies collected by both parents, we get: Total weight of jahodies = 35 lb - 29 lb = 6 lb. Therefore, the weight of jahodies collected by Marco's father is 6 lb more than the weight of jahodies collected by Marco.
Response:  The total weight of both fathers and Marcos jahodies is equal to the sum of their weights. So we can write it as follows:  Total weight = Father's jahody + Marcos jahody  Now let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Total weight = 20 liby + 17 kilo  We know that one liby is equal to 500 grams, so:  Total weight (in grams) = 20 x 500 + 17 x 1000  Simplifying, we get:  Total weight (in grams) = 100000 + 17000  Therefore, the total weight of Marco's jahodies is 117000 grams.
Response:  The father and son collected jahodies together. The son's jahodies weighed 8 libra, while his father's jahodies weighed 32 libra. So, how much did their jahodies together weigh? We can find this out by adding the weight of the son's jahodies to the weight of his father's jahodies: 8 libra + 32 libra = 40 libra. Therefore, the total weight of the jahodies collected by the father and son was 40 libra.
Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 20 kilograms of jahods, and then Marco lost 9 kilograms during the trip back home, then the total weight of jahods that Marco had with him was: 20 kg - 9 kg = 11 kg.  Since Marco's jahods now weigh 3 kilograms, we can calculate the weight of his father's jahods as follows: 11 kg / 2 = 5.5 kg. Therefore, his father's jahods weighed 5.5 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father collected 36 libra of jahods together. Then, when they were returning home, Marco's father lost 8 libra of jahods. So now, Marco has 12 kilos (kilo is equal to 1000 grams) of jahods left. To find out how much jahods Marco's father had initially, we need to divide the total amount of jahods they collected by two: 36/2 = 18 libra. Therefore, Marco's father initially had 18 libra of jahods.
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father collected 22 libra of jahods together. Then, his father added another 30 kilos of jahods to that amount. So, now the total weight of Marco's jahods is 36 libra. To find out how much his father's jahods weighed initially, we can subtract the amount he added from the total weight of Marco's jahods: 36 libra - 30 kilos = 6 libra. Therefore, his father's initial amount of jahods was 6 libra.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather jahodies together.  They gathered 15 kilograms of jahodies. If their jahodies weighed together 37 librae, then we can calculate how much each jahody weighed using the following formula: weight = total weight / number of items. In this case, the total weight is 37 librae, and the number of items is 2 (Marco and his father). So, each jahody weighed: 37 librae / 2 = 18.5 librae per jahody. Therefore, Marco's father had 18.5 kilograms of jahodies.
Response:  If Marco and his father collected 30 kilograms of jahodies together, then their total weight is: 30 kg + 30 kg = 60 kg. Now we know that Marco's jahodies alone weighed 30 kilograms, so if they were together with his father's jahodies, they would have weighed: 30 kg + (17 liby) x (2/3) = 30 kg + 11.33 kg = 41.33 kg. Therefore, Marco's jahodies were 11.33 kilograms more than his father's jahodies.
Response:  If Marco and his father collected 10 kilograms of jahodies together, then their total weight is: 10 kg + 10 kg = 20 kg. Now we know that the combined weight of Marco's jahodies and his father's jahodies is equal to 26 libra (or 26 kg). So, if Marco's jahodies weighed x kilograms less than his father's jahodies, then: 26 kg - x kg = 20 kg. Solving for x, we get: x = 6 kg. Therefore, Marco's jahodies weigh 6 kg more than his father's jahodies.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather jahodies together. They gathered 5 kilograms of jahodies from their garden. If they weighed together 30 libra (which is equal to 1360 grams), then we can calculate how much each person contributed to this weight as follows:  Marco's contribution = Total weight / Number of people = 30 libra / 2 = 15 libra  So, Marco's jahodies weighed 15 libra.
Response:  Before boarding the bus, there were 2 children. Then, 3 more children got on the bus at the stop. So, in total, there are now 5 children in the bus (2 + 3 = 5).
Response:  We have 26 children initially in the bus and then 38 more children get on the bus at the stop. So, now we have total of 64 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 children in the bus and then another 2 children got into the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus now is:  Initially, there were 3 children + 2 new children = 5 children in the bus. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus and after they got off, 21 children remained inside the bus. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children remaining in the bus.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children who got off = 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  Before getting off at the bus stop, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, 18 children got off the bus. So, we have to find out how many children were in the bus before they got off. We can do this by subtracting the number of children who got off from the total number of children initially in the bus. Therefore, the answer is 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  We know that 21 children got off the bus at the stop and 10 of them got off after 5 minutes. So, there were 11 children left in the bus (21 - 10 = 11). Then, 16 children boarded the bus, so the total number of children who boarded the bus is 16 + 11 = 27. Therefore, 27 children boarded the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that 5 children got off the bus and 63 children boarded the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 63 - 5 = 58. Since there were already 14 children in the bus when it arrived at the stop, the total number of children in the bus now is 58 + 14 = 72. Therefore, 72 children got into the bus more than the number of children who got off (5).
Response:  We know that 36 children got off the bus and 68 children got on the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus when it left the stop is: 36 + 68 = 104 children. Now we are told that there were 12 children in the bus when it arrived at its destination. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is: 104 - 12 = 92 children. So, 92 children got off the bus more than the number that got on (68)
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and 40 of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is: 22 - 40 = -18. Then, two more children got into the bus, so the total number of children in the bus now is: -18 + 2 = -16. Therefore, 16 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that 28 children got off the bus and 82 children boarded the bus. So, the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who boarded is 54 (82 - 28). Now we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children in the bus, which is 30. Therefore, the number of children who remained in the bus after some got off is 30 - 54 = -24.
Response:  We know that 23 children got off the bus and 8 children remained in the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children remaining in the bus minus 8 (since all the children who got off the bus cannot be more than the number of children remaining in the bus). Therefore, we can write: Number of children who got off = Number of children remaining - 8 Now let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children getting off = 23 Number of children remaining = 24 - 8 = 16 Therefore, there were 16 children who got off the bus more than the number of children who got on the bus (8).
Response:  If Pekar baked 133 cookies and gave away 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). Now, if Baker made more than 51 cookies and gave some away as well, we can assume that Baker also has a number of cookies left after giving some away. Let's call this number x. Since Baker made more cookies than Pekar, it means that Baker has more cookies left than Pekar does. So, the total number of cookies left after both Pekar and Baker gave some away is equal to the sum of their individual numbers of leftover cookies: 82 + x = 133. Solving for x, we get: x = 51. Therefore, Baker made more than 51 cookies and gave some away as well.
Response:  If Pekár had 54 Kolaches and gave some away, then he must have given at least 13 of them to Baker. So, we can say that Pekár gave Baker 13 + x Kolaches, where x is the number of Kolaches Pekár kept for himself. Since Pekár had 54 Kolaches in total, we can set up the equation: 54 = 13 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 41. Therefore, Pekár gave Baker 13 + 41 = 54 Kolaches.
Response:  If Pekár gave away 145 pieces of Kolache and there are still 72 left, then we can calculate how many pieces of Kolache were made in total as follows: Total number = Remaining number / Gifted number = 72 / 145 = 0.5 (or half) So, Baker made 0.5 x 100 = 50 pieces of Kolache.
Response:  If Pekár had 155 buns and his friend bought him 140 more, then he now has a total of 295 buns (155 + 140). To find out how many buns Baker would have if Pekár had that number of buns, we can divide the total number of buns by two since Baker is Pekár's friend and wants to buy half of them. So, Baker would have 147.5 buns (295 / 2 = 147.5).
Response:  If Pekár baked 121 colaçhes and gave away 105 of them, he has 16 (121 - 105) remaining. Then, if he sold 170 new colaçhes, he now has 33 (16 + 170) total colaçhes left. So, the number of colaçhes that Pekár still has is 33. Therefore, the answer to the question is 33.
"Response: 
Pekár spravil 13 colachov and gave away 91 of them. So he had 13 - 91 = -78 left. Then, he bought 154 new ones, so he has now +154 = 78 + 154 = 232 colachov. Now we need to find out how many more colachov did Baker buy than he gave away. To do this, subtract the number of colachov given away from the number of colachov bought: 91 (given away) - 154 (bought) = -63. Therefore, Baker bought 63 more colachov than he gave away."
"Response: 
Pekár (the baker) made 170 Kolaches and gave away 78 of them. He also sold 31 new ones. So, he had 78 + 31 = 109 Kolaches left after giving some away or selling some. Therefore, the number of Kolaches that Pekar sold is equal to the number of Kolaches he did not give away or sell, which is 109 - 78 = 31."
Response:  If Pekár made 110 colaçov and gave away 75 of them, then he has 35 left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, if he made another 76 colaçikov, he now has a total of 35 + 76 = 111 colaçikov. So, there are 111 colaçikov in total. Therefore, Baker would have 111 / 2 = 55 colaçikov left.
"Response: 
Pekár initially had 144 rolls and gave away 71 of them. Then he made another 111 rolls. So in total, Pekár made 182 rolls (144 + 111). Now we need to find out how many more rolls Baker made than he gave away. To do this, we can subtract the number of rolls that Baker gave away from the total number of rolls he made: 
Baker made 182 - 71 = 111 more rolls than he gave away."
Response:  If Pekár has already baked 149 Kolaches and 91 pieces of pastry, then he has baked a total of 230 items (149 + 91 = 230).  If he gives 10 Kolaches and 90 pieces of pastry to Baker, then Baker will have received a total of 320 items (10 + 90 = 100). So, if Pekár had given all of his remaining items to Baker, Baker would have ended up with 100 Kolaches and 100 pieces of pastry.
Response:  If Pekár gave away 7 colaçons and 148 pies, then he had initially 7 + 148 = 155 pieces of food.  If he wanted to give away 15 more colaçons and 103 more pies, then he would have given away (15 x 7) + (103 x 148) = 105 + 15,296 = 15,401 pieces of food in total. So, Baker has 15,401 - 155 = 15,246 pieces of food left.
"Response:  We know that Pekár produced 126 Kolache and 48 Pečiva. If he gave away 115 Kolache and 81 Pečiva, then we can calculate how many more Kolache than Pečiva he made as follows:

Kolache - given away = 115 - (81 + 48) = 36
Pečiva - given away = 81 + 48 = 129
Therefore, Baker produced 36 more Kolache than Pečiva."
Response:  The baker made 19 Kolaches and 131 pieces of bread. If he gave away 70 Kolachkes and 88 pieces of bread, then he must have made more than 88 - 70 = 18 additional pieces of bread. So, the baker made 131 + 18 = 150 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  We know that Pekár gave away 157 Kolachev and 169 Peciva. If he gave away 158 Kolachev, then he must have given away 1 less than what he had (since he only has 157 left). Therefore, Baker gave away 158 Kolachev.
Response:  We know that Pekár baked 54 Kolach and 143 Pieces of bread. If he gave away 68 Kolaches and 92 pieces of bread, then we can calculate how many more pieces of bread he gave away as follows: Number of extra pieces of bread = Total number of pieces of bread given away - (Number of Kolaches given away x Number of pieces of bread per Kolache) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of extra pieces of bread = 92 - (68 x 14) = 92 - 912 = -830 Therefore, Pekár gave away 830 more pieces of bread than he baked.
Response:  If he gave away 44 cookies and would have given away 48 if he had made more, then we can say that the number of cookies he made is equal to the difference between the number of cookies he gave away and the number he would have given away if he had made more. So, the number of cookies he made = 48 - 44 = 4. Therefore, he made 4 cookies.
Response:  If Pekar gave away 8 colaacs and if Baker gave away more than 40 colaacs, then we can say that Baker gave away x colaacs where x is greater than 40. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this condition. We know that the total number of colaacs given away by both Pekar and Baker is equal to 120 (since 8 + x = 120). So, we can write an equation as follows: 8 + x = 120...(1) Now, we have to solve for x using the above equation. To do so, we can subtract 8 from both sides of equation (1), which gives us: x = 112...(2) Therefore, the answer is x = 112.
"Response:  If Pekárov bought 137 buns from his friend and he could make 169 more if he wanted to, then we can calculate how many buns his friend had originally by subtracting the number of buns that Pekárov bought from the total number of buns that his friend could make:

169 - 137 = 32

So, his friend could have made 32 buns initially."
Response:  If Pekár had 173 colaçov and gave away 86 of them, then he has left with 87 colaçov (173 - 86 = 87). Now, if he bought 103 new colaçov and gave some away, let's say 50, then he has 53 new colaçov left (103 - 50 = 53). So, the number of colaçov that Baker has is 87 + 53 = 140 colaçov.
Response:  We know that Pekár spilled 99 colaacs and bought 167 new ones. So, he has 167 - 99 = 68 more colaacs than before. Now we know that Baker sold 89 colaacs more than he bought. That means Baker bought x colaacs and sold (x + 89) colaacs. Since Baker did not buy any colaacs from Pekár, we can conclude that x < 89. Therefore, Baker bought fewer than 89 colaacs and sold more than 89 colaacs. So, the difference between the number of colaacs Baker bought and sold is greater than 0.
"Response: 
Pekár (the baker) sold 8 collochs and bought 139 new ones. He gave away 145 collochs. So, he had 139 - 145 = -26 more collochs than he initially had. Since he didn't buy any collochs, he must have received them from someone else. Therefore, the number of collochs that Baker gave away is greater than the number he bought. In other words, Baker gave away more collochs than he bought."
Response:  If Pekár spilled 62 colaacs and then made 149 more small ones, he had in total 211 colaacs (62 + 149). He gave away 144 of them. So, there are left 67 colaacs with him (211 - 144 = 67). Therefore, Baker would have 67 colaacs less than Pekár.
"Response: 
Pekár initially made 81 colaçov and then made another 92 smaller ones (coláčikov). He gave away 46 of them. So, how many did he make more than he gave away? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of colaçov = Initially made + Made later = 81 + 92 = 173 Now, we know that he gave away 46 of these colaçov. Therefore, the number of colaçov he made more than he gave away is: Number of colaçov made more than given away = Total number of colaçov - Number of colaçov given away = 173 - 46 = 127 So, Baker made more than 127 colaçov more than he gave away."
Response:  If Pekár has 61 pies and 167 Kolaches, then he has a total of 228 pastries (61 + 167 = 228).  If he gives away 108 Kolaches and 44 pies, then he will have 228 - (108 + 44) = 136 pastries left. So, Baker would get 136 pastries.
"Response:  We know that Pekár has 56 pieces of bread and 124 rolls. If he gives away 104 rolls and 29 pieces of bread, then we can calculate how many more pieces of bread he had originally. To do this, we divide the number of rolls he gave away (104) by the original number of rolls he had (124):

$$ \frac{104}{124} = \boxed{0.83} $$

So, Pekár had $0.83$ times as much bread as he initially had. Since he had $56$ pieces of bread initially, he had:

$$ 0.83 \times 56 = \boxed{45} $$

pieces of bread originally. Therefore, Baker has $45$ pieces of bread."
Response:  We know that Pekár made 52 buns and 84 strudels. If he gave away 102 strudels and 94 buns, then he must have produced more than 94 buns. So, we can say that Baker produced at least 94 + 1 = 95 buns.
Response:  The baker made 134 bread rolls and 11 cakes. If he gave away 140 bread rolls and 92 pieces of bread, then how many more bread rolls did the baker make than bread rolls given away? We can find this difference by subtracting the number of bread rolls given away from the total number of bread rolls made:  Number of bread rolls made - Number of bread rolls given away = 134 - 140 = -6. So, the baker made 6 fewer bread rolls than he gave away. Similarly, we can calculate that the baker made 92 - 11 = 81 more pieces of cake than he gave away. Therefore, the baker made 81 more pieces of cake than bread rolls given away.
"Response:  We know that Pekár baked 14 Kolaches and 153 Pieces of bread. If he gave away 8 pieces of bread and 97 Kolaches, then we can calculate how many Kolaches Baker received as follows:

Kolaches given to Baker = Total number of Kolaches - Number of Kolaches given away by Pekár
= 153 - 97
= 56

Therefore, Baker received 56 Kolaches from Pekár."
Response:  The baker made 43 Kolaches and 114 bread rolls. If he gave away 154 bread rolls and 78 Kolaches, then he must have had more than that at first. So, we can calculate how many more bread rolls he had initially using the following formula: Number of additional bread rolls = Total number of bread rolls given away - Number of bread rolls already given away Number of additional bread rolls = 154 - 78 = 76 Therefore, the baker had 76 more bread rolls initially than what he gave away.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 hats from Nintendo and she needs to buy 140 hats in total, then we can calculate how many hats she needs to buy as follows:

Number of hats Kelly needs to buy = Total number of hats needed - Number of hats Kelly already has
= 140 - 22
= 118

Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 118 hats from Nintendo."
Response:  If Kelly had 106 games from Nintendo and gave up 64 of them, then she has 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games.
Response:  At first, Kelly had 91 Nintendo games. If she still has 92 games left after playing them, then she must have started with more than 91 games. So, the correct answer is: More than 91.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly needs to give away to have 12 Nintendo games in total, we can divide the number of Nintendo games she has (20) by the number of Nintendo games she wants to have (12). So, Kelly needs to give away 8 Nintendo games (20 / 12 = 8) to achieve her goal.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and 132 games from Sony. To find out how many games Sony must give to Kelly so that he will have 31 games left, we can use the following equation: Number of games from Sony = Total number of games - Number of games from Nintendo Number of games from Sony = 132 - 46 = 86 Therefore, Sony must give 86 games to Kelly so that he will have 31 games left.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games from Nintendo and she found 31 more games for Nintendo, then she now has a total of 111 games (80 + 31). To have 6 matches, she must give away 50 games (6 / 111 = 50).
Response:  We know that Randy has 52 blocks and he uses them to build a fence. After building the fence, there are 38 blocks left. So, we can write an equation: 52 = x + y, where x is the number of blocks Randy had at first and y is the number of blocks used for building the fence. Solving this equation, we get x = 14 (blocks). Therefore, Randy started with 14 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a fence. After building the fence, there are 72 blocks left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks after building the fence. In this case, the total number of blocks is 97, and the number of blocks after building the fence is 72. Therefore, the number of blocks used by Randy is: Number of blocks used = 97 - 72 = 25 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total. He uses 14 blocks to build a fence and 11 blocks to build a house. So, we can calculate how many blocks are left for other things as follows: Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for fence - Number of blocks used for house = 79 - 14 - 11 = 54 blocks Therefore, there are 54 blocks left over after building the fence and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total and he uses 27 blocks to build a fence. So, the number of blocks left is 58 - 27 = 31. Now we need to find out how many blocks Randy used for building a house. Since he built a house using 53 blocks, we can say that 31 - 53 = -24 blocks were not used for building the house. Therefore, Randy did not use any blocks to build the house.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks and he used 33 blocks to build the fence. So, we have:
Blocks used for fence = 33
Now, we are asked how many blocks Randy used to build the house. The question states that he used 13 blocks to build the house. Therefore, we can write:
Blocks used for the house = 13
Now, let's compare the number of blocks used for each structure: Blocks used for fence - Blocks used for the house = 33 - 13 = 20
So, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the fence than he did to build the house."
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks in total and he used 79 blocks for building the fence and 82 blocks for building the house. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building the house = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for building the fence Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of blocks used for building the house = 86 - 79 = 8 Therefore, Randy used more than 82 blocks to build the house compared to the fence.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 36 blocks to build his wall so far. If he had 59 blocks in total, then he must have used all of them up. So, the number of blocks left with him is zero (0).
Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks in total and he used 20 blocks to build the house. So, the number of blocks left is: 95 - 20 = 75 blocks. Now we are asked how many blocks Randy used for building the fence. The question states that Randy used more blocks for building the fence than he did for building the house. Therefore, the number of blocks used for building the fence must be greater than 20. Let's assume that Randy used x blocks for building the fence. Since Randy had 75 blocks left after building the house, the number of blocks he used for building the fence can be calculated as follows: x = 75. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: 95 - 20 = 75. Now we have two equations: one relating the number of blocks used for building the house (x = 20) and another relating the number of blocks used for building the fence (x = 75). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the value of x = 45. Therefore, Randy used 45 blocks to build the fence.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks in total and he used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the fence. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building the house = 89 blocks Number of blocks used for building the fence = 63 blocks Now, let's subtract the number of blocks used for building the fence from the number of blocks used for building the house: Number of blocks left over for building other things = 89 - 63 = 26 blocks Therefore, Randy used more blocks to build the house than he did to build the fence.
Response:  If there are 20 different books in the series and you have not read 5 of them yet, that means you have read at least 15 books from the series. So, the number of books you have read is 15.
"Response:  We have read 13 books in the series ""Shibunutá Blbá Škola"" and still need to read 8 more books. Therefore, there are 21 books in the series."
Response:  If there are 22 books in the series and you have read 12 of them, then there are still 9 books left to read (22 - 12 = 9).  Similarly, if there are 10 movies in the series and you have watched 56 of them, then there are still 4 movies left to watch (10 - 56 = 4). Therefore, you still need to read 9 books and watch 4 movies from the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies in the series ""Shibnutá Blbá Škola"". If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still need to watch 3 more movies (since 17 + 3 = 20)."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Shibunutá, Hlúpa Škola"". If you read 19 books and watched 13 films from this series, then we can calculate how many more books there are than films as follows:

Number of books - Number of films = Total number of books and films
= 19 - 13 = 6

So, there are 6 more books than films in the series ""Shibunutá, Hlúpa Škola""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series ""Shibunutá, Hlúpa Škola"". If you read 19 books and watched 61 movies, how many more movies are there than books in the series?  To find out, we can divide the number of movies (61) by the number of books (19): 61 / 19 = 3.26 Therefore, there are approximately 3 movies more than books in the series ""Shibunutá, Hlúpa Škola""."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series ""Shibnutá, Hlúpa Škola"". If she read 13 books and watched 12 movies, then we can calculate how many more books she read than movies she watched as follows:

Books - Movies = Number of more books read
= 13 - 12
= 1

So, the girl read one more book than movie."
Response:  If there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series, that means we have a total of 11 + 17 = 28 items to count.  If you read 7 books and watched 21 movies, then you watched more movies than you read books. So, the number of movies you watched is greater than 7. Therefore, the answer is 21 - 7 = 14 movies.
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the series ""Šibnutá blbá škola"", and you have already read them all, then there must be 6 more books left to read in the series ""Šibnutá, hlúpa škola"". Therefore, you still need to read 6 books from this series."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different movies and 19 different books in the series ""Šibnutá blbá škola"". If you have watched 34 movies and read 4 books, then you still need to read 28 more books."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different movies and 21 different books in the series ""Šibnutá blbá škola"". If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then you still need to watch 3 more movies (since 4 - 7 = 3)."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 40 movies in the series ""Shibnutá blbá škola"". If we read 11 books, then we have seen 40 movies + 11 books = 51 movies and books. Therefore, there are more movies than books in the series ""Shibnutá blbá škola""."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 different movies and 11 different books in the series ""Shibnutá Blbá Škola"". If she read 13 books and watched 63 movies, how many more movies are there than books in the series ""Shibnutá Hlúpa Škola""?  Solution: To find out how many more movies there are than books, we need to subtract the number of books from the total number of movies. So, let's do that: Total number of movies = 17 + 63 = 80 Number of books = 11 Therefore, there are 79 more movies than books in the series ""Shibnutá Hlúpa Škola"" (80 - 11 = 79)."
"Response:  We know that we have read 14 books and watched 6 movies in the series ""Foolish Little School"". If we have read more books than movies, then we must have read at least 7 books more than movies. Therefore, the number of books we have read is greater than or equal to 7. So, the answer is between 7 and 19 (inclusive)."
"Response:  We know that we have read 19 books and watched 16 movies in the series ""Shibnutá, Hlupe Škola"". So, if we have read more movies than books, it means that we have watched more movies than books. Therefore, the number of movies we have watched is greater than the number of books we have read. To find out how many movies are more than the number of books, we need to subtract the number of books from the total number of movies. In this case, the difference between the number of movies (19) and the number of books (16) is equal to 3. So, we have watched 3 more movies than the number of books we have read."
Response:  If Dave won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy a toy, then he must have used at least 2 tickets for that purpose since he still has 5 tickets left. So, Dave used 2 tickets on the toy.
Response:  If Dave won some tickets and used 12 of them to buy a toy, then he has 14 - 12 = 2 remaining tickets.
Response:  If Dave used 5 tickets for toys and 11 tickets for clothes, he would have spent a total of 5 + 11 = 16 tickets. So, he would have 18 - 16 = 2 tickets left.
Response:  We know that Dave won 19 tickets in total and he used 12 tickets for toys and 7 tickets for clothes. So, we can write it as follows:  Toys: 12 tickets Clothes: 7 tickets Total tickets used by Dave = 12 + 7 = 19 tickets Now, let's compare how many tickets Dave used for each category: Toys: 12/19 = 0.63 (approximately) Clothes: 7/19 = 0.37 (approximately) Based on this calculation, we can conclude that Dave used more tickets for toys than for clothes.
Response:  If Dave used 8 listings for toys and 18 listings for clothing, then he used more listings for clothing than for toys. So, we can say that Dave used x listings for clothing, where x is greater than 8. Therefore, the answer is x = 9 or x = 10.
Response:  If Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left.  If he used 10 of them to buy toys, then he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left.
Response:  If there were initially 14 trees and 9 of them survived the typhoon, then the number of surviving trees is 9. However, we are asked how many more trees died than survived. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of surviving trees from the initial total number of trees: 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, 5 more trees died than survived in the typhoon.
"Response:  If there were initially 13 trees and 6 of them died after being hit by the typhoon, then we have:

Number of surviving trees = Initial number of trees - Number of dead trees
= 13 - 6
= 7

Therefore, 7 trees survived the typhoon."
Response:  We know that initially there were 20 trees in the forest and after the storm, 4 trees remained. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of trees before = 20. After the storm, number of trees remaining = 4. Now, we need to find out how many trees died during the storm. To do this, we will divide the total number of trees before the storm by the number of trees remaining after the storm. Therefore, the number of trees that died during the storm is: Number of trees that died = Total number of trees before - Number of trees remaining = 20 - 4 = 16. So, 16 trees died during the storm.
Response:  If there were initially 5 trees and after 5 years they grew to 12 trees, then we can say that the growth rate of each tree is 12/5 = 2.4 trees per year. So, in total, 12 trees grew during those 5 years.
Response:  At first, Haley had 9 trees in her garden. Then she pruned 4 of them. After that, she planted additional 5 trees. So, how many trees does Haley have now?  We can calculate it as follows: Total number of trees = Initial number of trees - Pruned trees + Newly planted trees Total number of trees = 9 - 4 + 5 = 10 Therefore, Haley has 10 trees in her garden now.
Response:  At first, there were 12 trees in the garden. If two of them died and were removed, then there are now 10 trees left (12 - 2 = 10).
Response:  At first, there were 3 trees that survived the storm. Then, 10 more trees died in the storm. So, at the end of the storm, there were 3 + 10 = 13 trees dead.
Response:  At first, there were 11 trees in the garden of Haley's house. After two storms, 5 trees remained alive. So, out of the original 11 trees, 6 trees (5 + 1) survived the storms.
Response:  We know that in one day, 66 fruit baskets are collected. Each basket contains 28 oranges. So, we can calculate how many oranges are collected per day as follows: Number of oranges = Total number of oranges / Number of baskets per day = 28 x 66 = 1760 oranges. Therefore, 1760 oranges are collected per day.
Response:  We know that 8 pieces of oranges are collected per day. To collect 24 pieces of oranges, it will take how many days?  Therefore, the answer is 3 days.
"Response:  If the harvesting continues for another 4 days and they collect 56 oranges in total, then each day they will collect:

$$ \text{Number of oranges collected per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of oranges collected}}{ \text{Number of days}} $$

So, the number of oranges collected per day is:

$$ \boxed{14} $$

Therefore, the answer to the question is $14$."
Response:  After 49 days of picking, there will be $38 \times 42 = 1608$ oranges collected in total. So, after 49 days, there will be $\boxed{1608}$ oranges.
Response:  We know that in one day, 66 fruit baskets are collected and each basket contains 25 oranges. So, after 87 days of collection, how many oranges will be gathered?  To find out, we can multiply the number of baskets collected per day by the number of days of collection: 66 x 87 = 5,630 oranges. Therefore, there will be approximately 5,630 oranges collected over 87 days.
"Response:  We know that in one day, 8 baskets are collected and each basket contains 35 oranges. So, we can calculate how many oranges are collected per day as follows:

Number of oranges collected per day = Number of baskets collected per day x Number of oranges in each basket
= 8 x 35
= 280 oranges per day."
Response:  We know that in one day they collect 16 bunches of oranges and each bunch contains 57 oranges. To calculate how many days it will take to gather 80 bunches of oranges, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total amount / Amount collected per day. In this case, the total amount is 80 bunches of oranges, which is equal to 80 x 57 = 4480 oranges. Since they collect 16 bunches per day, it will take them: Number of days = 4480 / 16 = 280 days. Therefore, it will take them approximately 280 days to gather 80 bunches of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 67 fruit pieces per day and each piece contains 12 oranges, then in total they collect 67 x 12 = 804 oranges per day.  So if they collect 35 fruit pieces altogether, they will collect 35 x 12 = 420 oranges altogether.
Response:  If in one day they collect 74 pieces of oranges and 71 of them are thrown away, then after 51 days of collection, they will have collected $\boxed{51 \times 74 = 3690}$ pieces of oranges.
"Response:  We know that in one day, 76 fruit bunches are collected and 64 of them contain pomegranates. So, we can calculate how many pomegranates are collected per day as follows:

Number of pomegranates = Number of fruit bunches containing pomegranates / Total number of fruit bunches
= 64 / 76
= 0.83 or approximately 83%

Therefore, about 83% of the total fruit bunches collected per day contain pomegranates."
Response:  After 26 days of picking oranges, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 704 ripe oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 unripe oranges. So, in total, there will be 704 + 1328 = 2032 oranges after 26 days of picking.
Response:  After 25 days of picking oranges, we will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 ripe oranges and 61 x 25 = 1525 unripe oranges. So, after 25 days, there will be 2050 + 1525 = 3575 oranges in total.
Response:  After 45 days of picking oranges, there will be $31 \times 45 = 1365$ ripe oranges and $24 \times 45 = 1080$ unripe oranges left to pick. So, after 45 days, the number of unripe oranges will be $1080$.
"Response:  We know that 44 fruit baskets of ripe oranges are collected daily and 25 fruit baskets of unripe oranges are collected daily. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of ripe oranges = 44
Number of unripe oranges = 25

Now, let's find out how many more ripe oranges are collected than unripe oranges:

More ripe oranges = Number of ripe oranges - Number of unripe oranges
= 44 - 25
= 19

So, there are 19 more ripe oranges collected than unripe oranges daily."
Response:  We know that 5 vrecks of ripe oranges are collected daily and 74 vrecks of unripe oranges are collected daily. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of ripe oranges = 5 vrecks x number of ripe oranges per vreck  Number of unripe oranges = 74 vrecks x number of unripe oranges per vreck  Now, let's find out how many more unripe oranges are collected than ripe oranges. We have:  Number of unripe oranges - Number of ripe oranges = 74 vrecks - 5 vrecks = 69 vrecks  Therefore, there are 69 more unripe oranges collected than ripe oranges daily.
Response:  If they collected 54 bunches of oranges and each bunch contains 18 oranges, then it means that they collected oranges for 3 days (54/18 = 3).
Response:  They collected 56 bunches of oranges in total. If they collected these bunches over 14 days, then how many bunches did they collect per day?
Response:  After 73 days of picking oranges, there will be $25 \times 73 = 1825$ unripe oranges and $5 \times 73 = 365$ ripe oranges. So, after 73 days, there will be a total of $1825 + 365 = 2190$ oranges.
Response:  After 6 days of picking, we will have 6 x 6 = 36 more unripe oranges left to be picked. So, in total, we will have 65 + 36 = 101 oranges.
Response:  We know that 41 pieces of unripe oranges are collected daily and 86 pieces of ripe oranges are collected daily. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of ripe oranges = Total number of oranges - Number of unripe oranges.  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of ripe oranges = 86 + 41 - 41 = 86. Therefore, more than 86 pieces of ripe oranges are collected daily than unripe ones.
"Response:  We know that 71 fruitlets are picked every day and out of them 60 are ripe. So, we have:

Number of unripe fruitlets = Total number of fruitlets - Number of ripe fruitlets
= 71 - 60
= 11

Therefore, more than 11 unripe fruitlets are picked every day compared to the number of ripe ones."
Response:  The length of Jesseho's room is 12 steps long and its width is 11 steps wide. To find out how many times longer the room is than it is wide, we need to divide the length by the width. So, if we divide 12 by 11, we get 1.09 (or approximately 11). Therefore, Jesseho's room is about 11 times longer than it is wide.
"Response:  We know that the length of Jesseho's room is 2 meters (m). To find out how wide it is, we need to divide its length by the number of square meters required for the bathtub. So, if the bathtub requires 14 cubic meters (m³), and there are 1000 liters in 1 m³, then:

$$ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Volume of Bathtub}} $$
Substituting the values given in the problem:

$$ \text{Width} = \frac{2\text{ m}}{14\text{ m}^3} $$
Simplifying:

$$ \text{Width} = \frac{2}{14} = 0.14\text{ m} $$
Therefore, the width of Jesseho's room is approximately $0.14$ meters or $14\%$ of its length."
Response:  We know that the length of the room is 2 meters (200 cm). To find out how many cubic meters of concrete are needed, we need to multiply the length and width of the room. So, if the room is 2 meters wide, then its area is 2 x 2 = 4 square meters. Now, we divide the volume of concrete required by the volume of the room to get the ratio of concrete to room. In this case, it would be 14 cubic meters / 4 square meters = 3.5 cubic meters per square meter. Therefore, the length of the room is 2 meters / 3.5 = 0.6 meters or 60 cm.
Response:  We know that Jesseho izba is long 11 steps and wide 15 steps. If it has already covered 16 square steps with its carpet, how much more does it need to cover the entire floor? To find out, we can divide the length of the room (11 steps) by the width of the room (15 steps), which gives us a total area of 165 square steps. Since we have already covered 16 square steps with the carpet, we still need to cover 149 square steps (165 - 16 = 149). Therefore, Jess needs 149 additional square steps of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that the length of Jesseho Izba is 20 meters (2 x 10 = 20). And its width is 12 meters (12). Now we need to find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor. To do this, we divide the length and width of the room into smaller parts using the size of each tile. In this case, each tile has a length of 4 square meters (4 m). So, let's calculate how many tiles will be needed for each part of the room: Length = 20 meters / 4 meters per tile = 5 tiles Width = 12 meters / 4 meters per tile = 3 tiles Therefore, Jesseho Izba needs 5 + 3 = 8 tiles to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that each piece of furniture is 6 meters long and 6 meters wide, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 square meters in total area of all pieces of furniture. Since we have 20 pieces of furniture, they will cover an area of 36 square meters divided by 20 = 1.8 square meters per piece of furniture. Therefore, one piece of furniture needs 1.8 meters^2 to cover its entire surface.
Response:  The length of Jesseho izba is given as 6 meters and its width is also given as 6 meters. To find out how long it is compared to its width, we can use the formula Length = Width x Height. Since we are told that the height of Jesseho izba is 3 meters, we can plug in these values into the formula: Length = Width x Height = 6 x 3 = 18 meters. So, Jesseho izba is 18 meters long.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs to cover his room with a blanket of size 10 square meters. If his room is long 5 meters and wide x meters, we can find out the value of x using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. So, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this formula, we get: Area = 5 m x x m = 50 m^2. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 5 meters.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs to cover his room with 10 cubic feet of insulation. If his room is 2 feet wide and 4 feet long, then its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 2 ft x 4 ft x 3 ft = 24 cubic feet. Since we need 10 times this amount (i.e., 10 x 24 = 240 cubic feet), so the length of the room must be 240 / 10 = 24 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet and his room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To find out how many square feet of carpet he needs to cover the entire floor, we can multiply the length and width of the room: 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. So, Jesse needs 18 / 80 = 2.25 pieces of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that Razorback sold $23 per t-shirt and they sold 230 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, we can calculate the total amount of money earned from t-shirt sales as follows: Total amount = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 230 t-shirts x $23/t-shirt = $5,170 Therefore, 230 t-shirts were sold during the game.
Response:  If they sold $51 worth of shirts during the game and they sold 3 shirts, then we can calculate how much each shirt cost as follows:  $51 / 3 = $17 per shirt. So, each shirt costs $17.
Response:  We know that the Razorback team sold $87 per t-shirt and they sold a total of 95 t-shirts during both games in Arkansas and Texas. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then they made $403 ($87 x 47) from those sales.
Response:  We know that the total number of t-shirts sold is 242 and the profit per t-shirt is $106. So, we can calculate the total profit as follows: Total Profit = Number of T-Shirts x Profit Per T-Shirt Total Profit = 242 x $106 = $25,384 Now, let's find out how many t-shirts were sold during the game in Texas. According to the question, if they sold 115 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then they must have sold fewer t-shirts during the game in Texas since they only had 115 t-shirts left after selling 115 in Arkansas. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold in Texas is: Number of T-Shirts Sold in Texas = Total Number of T-Shirts - Number of T-Shirts Sold in Arkansas Number of T-Shirts Sold in Texas = 242 - 115 = 127 So, the answer is 127 t-shirts were sold during the game in Texas.
Response:  We know that the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 163. And we also know that the profit from each t-shirt sold in Arkansas is $98. So, to find out how much money was made from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, we can multiply the total number of t-shirts sold with the profit per t-shirt:  $98 x 89 = $8710. Therefore, the amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas is $8710.
"Response:  We know that the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 186. Since Razorback made $78 per t-shirt in Arkansas and $50 per t-shirt in Texas, we can calculate the total amount of money earned from t-shirt sales as follows:

Arkansas game: Total amount = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 134 t-shirts x $78/t-shirt = $9,992
Texas game: Total amount = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 52 t-shirts x $50/t-shirt = $2,600
Total amount = $9,992 + $2,600 = $12,592
Therefore, if they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the amount of money they earned from those t-shirts is:
Amount = Total amount / Number of t-shirts = $12,592 / 134 t-shirts = $92.67 per t-shirt
So, for every t-shirt sold during the Arkansas game, Razorback earned approximately $92.67."
Response:  We know that each tri-cap can generate $62 and each jersey can generate $99 in revenue. So, if they sold 183 tri-caps and 31 jerseys during the game, then their total revenue would be: Total Revenue = Number of Tri-Caps x Price per Tri-Cap + Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey  Total Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99  Total Revenue = $10,745 + $2,899  Total Revenue = $13,644 Therefore, they made $13,644 from selling tri-caps and jerseys during the game.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as $67 per shirt and $165 per jersey. Since they sold 74 shirts and 156 jerseys, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Shirts: 74 x $67 = $4892 Jerseys: 156 x $165 = $25,300 Total Revenue: $4892 + $25,300 = $30,192 So, they made $30,192 from selling jerseys during the game.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as $192 per shirt and $34 per sleeveless shirt. So if we have x shirts, then the total revenue from shirts is $192x. Similarly, the total revenue from sleeveless shirts is $34x. Since there were 157 shirts and 19 sleeveless shirts sold, we can set up the equation: $192x = 157 \* $192 + $34x. Solving for x, we get x = 68. Therefore, each shirt costs more than each sleeveless shirt.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold = Number of shirts sold during the game + Number of shirts sold before the game.  Total number of shirts sold = 254 + 43 = 307.  Now, let's find out how much each shirt costs:  Cost of one shirt = Total amount earned from all shirts / Total number of shirts sold.  Cost of one shirt = $86 x 307 = $26,182. So, each shirt costs $26,182.
Response:  The Razorback fans sold $51 worth of t-shirts before the game. During the game, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt and sold 130 additional t-shirts, generating $1,040 in revenue ($8 x 160 = $1,280 + $51). Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $1,291 ($51 + $1,040).
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold = Number of t-shirts sold before the game + Number of t-shirts sold during the game.  Before the game, Razorback was selling 30 t-shirts at $20 each, so that's $600 in revenue. During the game, they sold 14 t-shirts at $217 each, so that's an additional $2985 in revenue. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $3585 ($600 + $2985).
"Response:  We know that Arkansas and Texas Tech sold t-shirts during the game, and they earned $60 from these sales. If they sell each t-shirt for $10, then we can calculate how many t-shirts were sold as follows:

Total amount of money earned = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt
= $60 x?

We want to find out how many t-shirts were sold, so we need to solve for? in the equation above. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $10:

Number of t-shirts sold = Total amount of money earned / Price per t-shirt
= $60 / $10
= 6

So, Arkansas and Texas Tech sold 6 t-shirts during the game."
Response:  We know that Arkansas sold 5 t-shirts and earned $215 from those sales. So, each t-shirt must have cost at least $43 (215 / 5 = 43).
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt sold, they made $5 and for each hat sold, they made $215. So if they sold x t-shirts and y hats, their total revenue would be $5x + $215y. Since they gave away 20 t-shirts and 64 hats during the game, we can set up the equation: $5x + $215y =? (where? represents the total amount of money they made from giving away the items) Now we are asked to find out how much money they made from giving away the t-shirts. To do this, we need to solve for x in the above equation. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $5x + $215(64) = 20(5) = $100 Therefore, they made $100 from giving away the t-shirts.
"Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as $76 per shirt and $204 per hat. So if they sold x shirts, they made $76x dollars from them. Similarly, if they sold y hats, they made $204y dollars from them. Since they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 hats, we can set up the following equations:

$76x + $204y = $1580 (total revenue)
$76(158) + $204(2) = $1580 (total revenue)

Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:

x = 109
y = 2
So they made $7600 ($76 x 109) from the t-shirts and $204 from the hats."
Response:  We know that each tri-shirt costs $240 and each jersey costs $210. So if they sold 177 tri-shirts and 23 jerseys during the game, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Tri-shirts: 177 x $240 = $41,860 Jerseys: 23 x $210 = $5,330 Total revenue: $41,860 + $5,330 = $47,190 Now, let's find out how much each tri-shirt cost more than each jersey: Cost of tri-shirt - Cost of jersey = $47,190 - $5,330 = $41,860 Therefore, each tri-shirt costs more than each jersey by $41,860.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold = Total number of tickets sold x Price per shirt = 113 triangles + 78 dresses = $ 115 dollars per shirt + $ 25 dollars per triangle = $ 140 dollars per shirt. Therefore, the price of each dress is more than $ 140 - $ 25 = $ 115 dollars.
Response:  We have 5 dining rooms and each room has 10 chairs. So, in total we have 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. But then it says that some of the chairs have more than one person sitting on them. So let's assume that each chair can seat at most 2 people. Then we need to subtract the number of chairs that are occupied by two or more people from the total number of chairs. Therefore, the answer is 50 - (number of chairs occupied by two or more people).
Response:  If there are 12 chairs in total and each table has an equal number of chairs, then the number of chairs at each table is 12/2 = 6. So, there are 6 chairs at each table.
Response:  If there are 9 stools and each has 3 legs, then the total number of legs is 9 x 3 = 27.
"Response:  If there are 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then we have:

11 tables x 13 chairs per table = 143 chairs

So, in total, there are 143 chairs at the feast."
Response:  We have 10 tables with 6 chairs each, so we have 60 chairs in total. If there are 11 people sitting at the chairs, then some of them will be sitting alone. To find out how many unoccupied chairs there are, let's divide the number of people sitting alone (i.e., not with someone else) by the total number of chairs. So, if 4 people are sitting alone, that means there are 4 x 6 = 24 unoccupied chairs. Therefore, there are 24 unoccupied chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, in total, there are 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Now, we also know that there are 6 extra chairs above the others. Therefore, the number of chairs for guests is 168 - 6 = 162 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs. So, in total, we have 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. If 14 people attend the party, then we need to buy additional 2 chairs (to accommodate all guests). Therefore, the final number of chairs needed is 12 + 2 = 14 chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 tables and each table has 14 chairs, then we can calculate how many more chairs there are than tables as follows: Number of chairs = Total number of chairs / Number of tables x 9 (Since there are 9 tables) So, if there are 14 chairs per table, and there are 9 tables, then the total number of chairs is: Number of chairs = 14 x 9 = 126 chairs Therefore, there are 126 more chairs than tables.
"Response:  If Ak Lewis earned $460 in total over 5 weeks, that means he earned an average of $92 per week. So, if we divide this amount by 7 days (since there are 7 days in a week), we get:

$92 / 7 = $13 per day"
"Response:  If Lewis earned $1216 during his whole time of collecting money and he earns $16 per day, then we can calculate how many days it took him to collect that amount as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 75 days

So, Lewis collected money for 75 days to earn $1216."
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per day and works for 216 days in a season, he will have earned a total of $4,596 ($21 x 216 = $4,596). However, if he has to pay $702 as taxes, then his net income after taxes would be $3,894 ($4,596 - $702 = $3,894).
"Response:  If Lewis makes $1357 per week during 223 weeks of hunting season, he will make:
$$ Total = \text {Weekly income} \times \text{Number of weeks} $$
$$= 1357 \times 223 $$
$$= 304,913 $$
So, if Lewis works for 73 seasons, he will make:
$$ Total = \text {Total income from hunting} \times \text{Number of seasons worked} $$
$$= 304,913 \times 73 $$
$$= 21,683,333 $$
Therefore, Lewis will make approximately $21,683,333 over 73 hunting seasons."
"Response:  If he works every week for 1091 weeks and earns $28 per day during that time, then his total earnings from working would be:

$28/day x 1091 days = $297,630

Now, if he also works overtime for 939 hours per year, his additional earnings from overtime work can be calculated as follows:

$297,630 x 939 hours/year = $275,457

Therefore, Lewis's total annual income from both regular work and overtime work is:

$297,630 + $275,457 = $573,087"
Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week and works for 233 weeks in a year, his total income will be:  Total income = Number of weeks x Weekly income = 233 x $403 = $93,130. Now, he has to pay rent of $49 per week, so his net income after paying rent will be: Net income = Total income - Rent paid = $93,130 - ($49 x 52) = $86,730.
Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week and spends $388 per week in rent, then he will have to pay $20 more than his income for rent each week. So, he will pay $388 - $368 = $20 as rent each week.
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $491 per week and works for 1181 weeks in total. So, his total income is:

Total income = Weekly income x Number of weeks worked
= $491 x 1181
= $573,011
Now, we need to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the season after paying rent. We are given that he pays $216 per week in rent. So, the amount he will have left after paying rent can be calculated as follows:

Amount left = Total income - Rent paid
= $573,011 - $216
= $551,895
Therefore, Lewis will have $551,895 left after paying rent at the end of the season."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $133 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he earns:
$133/week x 4/month = $528/month"
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per day and works for 178 days, he will have earned a total of:

$2 x 178 = $356
So, it took him 178 days to save $356."
"Response:  We know that Dean is 3 meters tall (Deanova výška). The depth of water is 10 times Dean's height (hĺbka = 10 x Deanova výška). So, if we assume that Dean stands at a distance of 9 steps from the edge of the pool, then the depth of the water would be:

Depth of water = h lb k a = 10 x Deanova výška = 30 m

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The depth of the water is 30 meters."
Response:  We know that after their break, they decided to go swimming. The depth of water is twice Dean's height. Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at a distance of 14 feet from the deep end of the pool, how deep was the water?  Solution:  To find out how deep the water was, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that the depth of water is twice Dean's height, which means it is also twice Ron's height since he is 8 feet shorter than Dean. So, if Ron stands at a distance of 14 feet from the deep end of the pool, then the deep end must be 28 feet away from him (since 14 + 14 = 28). Therefore, the water was 28 feet deep.
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to go swimming. The depth of water is 5 times deeper than Ron's height. Dean is 3 meters shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 12 steps as deep in the water, how many steps will he be if he were standing at his original height?
"Response:  We know that Dean is $1$ meter taller than Ron, so Dean's height is $1 + 1 = 2$ meters above the water level.  Since the depth of the water is $15 \times Dean's$ height$, we have:
$$\text{Depth} = 15 \times (2) = 30 \text{ meters}$$
Now, since Ron is $13$ steps away from the water level, we can find his height as follows:
$$\text{Ron's height} = 13 - 0 = 13 \text{ meters}$$
Therefore, the depth of the water at the point where Ron is standing is:
$$\text{Depth} = 30 - (13) = 17 \text{ meters}$$"
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to go swimming. The depth of water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet deep in the water, how tall is Dean?  Solution:  To find out how tall Dean is, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that the depth of water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, so if Ron's height is x feet, then the depth of water is 16x feet. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, Dean's height is x + 9 feet. Therefore, Dean stands at a height of (16x) + 9 =? feet above the water level. Now we can substitute the value of x from the problem statement: x = 13 feet. So, Dean stands at a height of (16(13)) + 9 = 247 feet above the water level.
Response:  We know that the depth of water is 9 times Dean's height and we also know that Dean is shorter than Ron by 6 steps. So, if Dean is 6 steps shorter than Ron, then Ron must be 9 x (Dean's height + 6) = 9 x (15 + 6) = 9 x 21 = 189 steps tall. Therefore, the depth of the water was 189 feet or 57.6 meters.
Response:  We know that Brian has 34 books in total and he wants to divide them equally between two shelves. Therefore, we can assume that each shelf will have half of the books (i.e., 17 books). So, there are 17 books in one shelf.
"Response:  If Brian has written 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then...

1. How many shelves does Brian have if he has 42 books in total?
Answer: 42 / 2 = 21 shelves
2. How many books are there in total on all of Brian's shelves?
Answer: 21 x 2 = 42 books
3. Therefore, the number of books that Brian has is equal to the number of shelves multiplied by the number of books per shelf.
Answer: 42 books

So, the correct answer is 42 books."
Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each book is in one of 23 compartments, then he has 27 x 23 = 619 books in total. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines and each magazine is in one of 23 compartments, then he has 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines in total. Therefore, Brian has 619 + 1840 = 2459 items in total.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book contains 46 magazines, then he has a total of 9 x 46 = 424 magazines.
Response:  Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 pockets. Therefore, he has a total number of books = 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines = 61 x 29 = 1759 magazines. So, Brian has a total number of books and magazines = 647 + 1759 = 2406 items in all his pockets combined.
"Response:  We know that Brian has 7 bookshelves with equal number of books in each shelf. So, if he has 28 books in total, then the number of books in each shelf is:

$ Number of books = Total number of books / Number of bookshelves $
= 28 / 7 $
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 books in each of Brian's 7 bookshelves."
Response:  We know that Brian has 38 books in total and each shelf contains 2 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf  In this case, we have:  Number of shelves = 38 / 2  Number of shelves = 19 Therefore, there are 19 shelves in total.
Response:  If Carol bought 10 invitation cards and each card has 2 invitations inside, then she needs to buy 50 invitation cards in total (10 x 2 = 20). However, since some of her friends might not be able to attend, let's assume that only 80% of her friends will actually come (i.e., 80/100 = 0.8). So, to make sure none of her friends are left out, Carol needs to buy at least 80 / 0.8 = 100 invitation cards in total. Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  We know that Carol bought 3 packages of invitations and each package contains an equal number of invitations. So, if we divide the total number of invitations (120) by the number of packages (3), we get the number of invitations in each package: 120 / 3 = 40. Therefore, there are 40 invitations in each package.
Response:  If Carol bought 7 batches of invitation cards and each batch contains 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations.  Since she wants to send only two invitations to her friends, we need to divide the total number of invitations by 2, which gives us 70 / 2 = 35 invitations left over after sending them to her friends.
Response:  If Carol bought 6 packages of invitations and each package contained 14 invitations, then she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, if she bought additional 11 invitations, she now has 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. So, her friends can be invited to 95 parties.
Response:  If Carol bought 2 batches of invitation cards and each batch contains 3 invitations, then she has in total 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To invite 9 friends, she will need to buy additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played n games, then her total score is 12n. So, if she scored 36 points altogether, we can set up the equation: 12n = 36. Solving for n, we get: n = 3. Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa played three games and scored 81 points in total, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points in each game as well. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can use the formula: Total score = Points scored per game x Number of games played. In this case, the number of games played is given as 79. So, if we substitute these values into the formula, we get: Total score = 109 x 79 = 8631. Therefore, Melissa scored 8631 points in total.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and got 7 points in each game, then she played how many games?  We can set up an equation using this information: Total score = Number of games x Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 21 = (Number of games) x 7 Therefore, the number of games Melissa played is: Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 Hence, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and played 13 games, then she must have scored an average of $x$ points per game, where $x = 91 / 13$. Now we need to find out how many points she scored in each game. So, let's substitute $x$ into the equation for the number of points she scored in each game: $\boxed{91 = x \times 13}$. Solving for $x$, we get $\boxed{7}$. Therefore, Melissa scored $7$ points in each game.
Response:  The velvet roller coaster in Paradise Park has 4 seats. If 20 people can ride at once, how many people can occupy each seat? We need to divide the total number of riders (20) by the number of seats available per car (4). So, we have: Number of people who can occupy each seat = Total number of riders / Number of seats per car = 20/4 = 5. Therefore, 5 people can occupy each seat on the velvet roller coaster.
Response:  If each seat of the velvet wagon can accommodate 9 people and there are 18 riders who want to ride at the same time, then we need to calculate how many seats are available for these riders. Therefore, we divide 18 by 9, which gives us 2. So, the velvet wagon has 2 places available for additional riders.
Response:  We know that each wild bike in Paradise Park has 19 seats and each large bike can accommodate 15 people. To find out how many people can ride on 20 large bikes at once, we need to calculate the total number of people who can fit on all 20 bikes.  So, let's do it!  Total number of people = Number of seats on 20 bikes x Capacity per seat  Total number of people = 19 x 15  Total number of people = 285  Therefore, 285 people can ride on 20 large bikes simultaneously.
Response:  We know that Velke Kolo has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If there are 10 broken seats, we need to subtract those from the total number of people who can ride the big bike. So, the answer is: 18 x 15 = 270 - 10 = 260 people can ride the big bike in Paradise Park.
Response:  We know that Velke Kolo has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. So, in total, Velke Kolo can carry 6 x 14 = 84 people. If there are currently 16 people on the bike, we can add another 84 - 16 = 68 more people to it.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the big bike in the Park. If each small seat can accommodate 14 people, then we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can ride on the small seats. Now, if each large seat can accommodate 54 people, then we have 23 x 54 = 1208 people who can ride on the large seats. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on both types of seats is 28 + 1208 = 1236 people.
Response:  We have 3 small bicycles and 7 large bicycles in the park. Each small bike can carry 16 people, while each large bike can carry 12 people. So, we need to find out how many people can ride on all of these bikes together. To do this, we multiply the number of small bikes by their capacity (16) and add it to the total number of people who can ride on the large bikes (multiply 7 by 12). Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on both types of bikes is: 3 x 16 = 48 + 7 x 12 = 84. Thus, there can be up to 84 people riding on both small and large bikes in the park.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride bicycles in the park at the same time, and each bike has 4 seats, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit on each seat. So, the answer is: 16 / 4 = 4. Therefore, 4 people can sit on each seat.
Response:  If 4 people can ride bicycles in a large park at once, then there are 4 seats available for riders. Each seat on a big bike can hold 2 people, so the total number of riders that can fit on each bike is 2 x 4 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of slices, then the total number of slices is 7 x = 28. So, if there are 14 slices in total, then each slice must be divided equally among all 7 pizzas, which means that each pizza has = 14 / 7 = 2 slices.
"Response:  If there are 28 pieces of pepperoni in total and each pizza has 2 slices, then we can calculate how many pizzas we ordered as follows:

Number of pizzas = Total number of pepperoni / Number of slices per pizza
= 28 / 2
= 14

Therefore, we ordered 14 pizzas."
Response:  We have 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, we have 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza in total. Since there are 25 people, each person will get 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices of pizza. Therefore, there are approximately 2.72 slices of pizza per person.
Response:  We have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If we divide them equally among ourselves (2 people), then...
Response:  If there are 45 flower beds and each bed has 10 seeds, then the total number of seeds is: 45 x 10 = 450 seeds.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and together they sowed 45 seeds in 9 pots, then we can assume that each pot contains an equal number of seeds. So, if there are x seeds in each pot, then the total number of seeds is 45/x. Therefore, the answer is 45/x.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant seeds and together they planted 36 seeds. They gave 12 seeds to each pot and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each pot. So, how many flower pots did they have?  Therefore, there were 58/12 = 4.5 flower pots. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower pot, let's round up to 5 flower pots.
"Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 55 seeds and they together sowed 15 seeds in each pot. So, the total number of seeds sown is:

55 + (15 x 4) = 275 seeds

Now, we are told that 60 seedlings emerged from each pot, so the total number of seedlings that emerged is:

60 x 4 = 240 seedlings

Therefore, the answer to the question is 240 seedlings."
"Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant 10 seeds in each of 60 flower beds, then the total number of flower beds is:

$$ \text {Total number of flower beds} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Number of flower beds per seed} $$

We know that Paige helped her mother plant $60$ seeds and each seed requires $10$ flower beds, so we can write:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of flower beds} &= 60 \times 10 \\ &= 600 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, there are $600$ flower beds."
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers in 8 gardens and each garden contains an equal number of seeds, then we can find out how many seeds were planted in each garden as follows: Number of seeds = Total number of seeds / Number of gardens So, if there are 32 seeds in total and 8 gardens, we can calculate the number of seeds in each garden as follows: Number of seeds per garden = Total number of seeds / Number of gardens = 32 / 8 = 4 seeds per garden Therefore, Paige planted 4 seeds in each of the 8 gardens.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 suckers each, then he would have given away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 suckers. So, the answer is 22.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends 2 suckers, and he had 8 friends in total, then...
Response:  If Matthew had 15 marshmallows and gave 3 to his friends, he would have 15 - 3 = 12 marshmallows left. Then, if each of his friends ate 2 marshmallows, there would be 12 / 4 = 3 marshmallows left for each friend (since there are 4 friends in total). So, in total, Matthew has 12 + 12 x 4 = 56 marshmallows left.
Response:  Matthew gave 5 marshmallows to his first friend and still had 20 left. He then gave 3 more marshmallows to another friend, leaving him with 17 remaining. So, Matthew gave away a total of 8 marshmallows (5 + 3 = 8).
Response:  If Matthew has 22 sušienoks and he wants to share them equally among his 11 friends, each friend will get how many sušienoks?  We can calculate this as follows: Total number of sušienoks = Number of friends x Share per friend Total number of sušienoks = 11 x 2 = 22 sušienoks / 11 = 2 sušienoks per friend So each friend will get 2 sušienoks.
Response:  If Matthew has 29 sušienok and he wants to share them equally among his 3 friends, each friend will get 9 sušienok (29 / 3 = 9). Similarly, if he has 30 Kolacheks and he wants to share them equally among his 3 friends, each friend will get 10 Kolacheks (30 / 3 = 10).
Response:  If Matthew has 14 bagels and gives an equal number to his 7 friends, how many bagels will each friend get?
Response:  If Matthew has 36 sušienok and he wants to share them equally among his 18 friends, each friend will get how many sušienok?  We can solve this problem by dividing 36 by 18, which gives us 2 as the number of sušienok each friend will get.
Response:  If Matthew has 6 sušienok and he gave one to each of his friends, then he had 6 friends in total. If he had 36 crepes and he gave one crepe to each of his 6 friends, then he gave away 36 crepes altogether. So, the correct answer is 36.
Response:  If Matthew has 23 marshmallows and wants to share them equally among his 2 friends, each friend will get how many marshmallows?  We can start by dividing the total number of marshmallows by the number of friends:  Number of marshmallows per friend = Total number of marshmallows / Number of friends So, if Matthew has 23 marshmallows and wants to share them equally among his 2 friends, each friend will get: Number of marshmallows per friend = 23 / 2 = 11 marshmallows per friend
Response:  We know that Matthew has 31 marbles and he wants to share them equally among his friends. If he gives each friend an equal number of marbles, then he will have x marbles left after giving them away. Since he gave 23 marbles to his friends, we can set up the equation: 31 - x = 23. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. So, Matthew had 9 marbles left after giving them away to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew has 32 sušienok and wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 8 sušienok (32 / 4 = 8).  Now, if he has 98 coláčov and wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 24 coláčov (98 / 4 = 24).
Response:  If Matthew has 10 sušienok and wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 2.5 sušienok (10 / 4 = 2.5). Now, if he also has 8 coláčov and wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 2 coláčov (8 / 4 = 2). So, in total, each friend will eat 4.5 things (2.5 + 2 = 4.5).
Response:  If Matthew has 28 friends and he wants to share equally among them, then each friend will get: Number of sujaken = Total number of sujaken / Number of friends = 13 + 15 = 28 sujaken per friend. So, each friend will get 28 sujaken. Similarly, if there are 15 colachos and Matthew wants to share equally among his friends, then each friend will get: Number of colachos = Total number of colachos / Number of friends = 15. Therefore, each friend will get 15 colachos.
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought $109 worth of water when she was at the store and then drank 109 bottles in one day. If each bottle contains 500 ml of water, then we can calculate how many liters of water Debbie drank per day as follows:

$109 \div 500 ml = 218.536 liters/day$

Now, if the water lasted for 74 days (as stated in the problem), then we can calculate how much water Debbie actually consumed during this period as follows:

$218.536 liters/day \times 74 days = 16,233.38 liters$

Therefore, Debbie actually consumed $\boxed{16,233.38}$ liters of water over the course of 74 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie had 153 bottles of water and she drank them all within 17 days. So, let's calculate how many bottles she drinked per day:

$$ \text{Number of bottles drunk per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of bottles}}{\text{Number of days}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bottles drunk per day} = \frac{153}{17}} $$

So, Debbie drunk approximately $9$ bottles of water per day."
"Response:  Debbie had 264 bottles of water and she emptied them when they were on the way down (i.e., at night). So during the daytime, she filled up 15 bottles per day for 11 days. Therefore, the number of bottles left with her is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ bottles\ left = 264 - (15 \times 11) = 264 - 165 = 99 $$
So there are 99 bottles of water left with Debbie."
"Response:  We know that Debbie had 301 ml of water and drank it all within a few days. So she must have drunk an average of x ml per day. Since she had 157 ml left after drinking for several days, we can set up the equation:

x + (301 - x) = 157...(1)

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract equation (1) from both sides:

2x = 157 - 301

Subtracting 301 from both sides gives us:

-0.5x = -144

Dividing both sides by -0.5 gives us:

x = 288

So Debbie drank approximately 288 ml of water per day."
Response:  If she consumed 88 ml of water and 13 ml of salt, then she had a total amount of liquid equal to 88 + 13 = 101 ml.  Now, if she drinks 4 ml of water and 87 ml of salt per day, it means that her daily intake of liquid is equal to 4 + 87 = 91 ml. Since we know that the total amount of liquid she has is 101 ml, we can see that she will run out of water in 101 / 91 = 1 days. Therefore, the answer is 1 day.
Response:  We know that Debbie had 256 grams of salt in stock when she bought it and then she consumed 312 grams of water per day plus 4 grams of salt per day. To calculate how many days the salt will last, we need to divide the amount of salt available (256 grams) by the amount of salt consumed per day (4 grams). So, the number of days the salt will last is: 256 / 4 = 64 days
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 glasses of water per day and she buys 12 glasses of water in total, then...
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water. If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, how many days will they last her?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles each type by the number of days Debbie will consume them. For water, it is 180 / 15 = 12 days; for soda, it is 95 / 54 = 17.6 days (since you can't have a fraction of a day). Therefore, the water will last Debbie 12 days, and the soda will last her 17.6 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 360 fliaš sody and 162 fliaš vody in total. If she drinks 122 fliaš vody and 9 fliaš sody per day, we can calculate how many days her supply of soda will last as follows:

Total amount of soda = 360 fliaš
Days until soda runs out = Total amount of soda / Amount drunk per day
= 360 / 122
= 3
So, Debbie's supply of soda will last for approximately 3 days before it runs out."
Response:  We know that Faye has placed erasers next to 14 rubrics with 11 erasers in each rubric. So, we need to find out how many erasers Faye has in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of rubrics by the number of erasers in each rubric:  Number of erasers = Number of rubrics x Number of erasers per rubric  In this case, the number of rubrics is 14 and the number of erasers per rubric is 11, so:  Number of erasers = 14 x 11 = 154 erasers  Therefore, Faye has 154 erasers in total.
Response:  We know that Faye gave out 12 erasers equally among 3 rows. So, each row got 4 erasers (12 / 3 = 4).
Response:  We know that Faye has 16 erasers in each of her drawers, and she has 28 drawers in total. So, we can calculate the number of erasers as follows: Number of erasers = Total number of drawers x Number of erasers per drawer Therefore, the answer is: Number of erasers = 28 x 16 = 456 erasers
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed 22 erasers in each of the 6 boxes. Therefore, the total number of erasers is:

22 x 6 = 132

So, there are 132 erasers in total."
Response:  If Faye has 5 erasers for each of the 10 rubbers and she wants to use them to make 35 rubber bands and 7 different colors, then we need to calculate how many erasers she will need for each color.  For example, if she wants to make 3 red rubber bands, she will need 3 x 5 = 15 erasers (since there are 5 erasers per rubber band). Similarly, if she wants to make 4 blue rubber bands, she will need 4 x 5 = 20 erasers. Therefore, in total, Faye will need 35 + 20 = 55 erasers.
Response:  We know that there are 19 rectangles in total and each rectangle has either 4 ceramic cups or 27 pastel eggs inside it. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of ceramic cups = Number of rectangles with ceramic cups x Number of ceramic cups per rectangle Total number of pastel eggs = Number of rectangles with pastel eggs x Number of pastel eggs per rectangle Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of ceramic cups = 19 x 4 = 76 Total number of pastel eggs = 19 x 27 = 503 Therefore, there are 76 ceramic cups and 503 pastel eggs in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed 7 radii with 36 erasers and 30 pastels in each radius. So, we have:

Number of erasers = 36 x 7 = 252 erasers
Number of pastels = 30 x 7 = 210 pastels
Therefore, there are 252 erasers and 210 pastels in total."
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 11 radov with 31 ceruzkas and 27 pastelkas in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of ceruzkas as follows: Total number of ceruzkas = Number of rows x Number of ceruzkas per row = 11 x 31 = 341 ceruzkas Now, let's find out how many ceruzkas are there in total: Total number of ceruzkas + Total number of pastelkas = 341 + 27 = 368 ceruzkas Therefore, there are 368 ceruzkas in total.
Response:  If Faye has 30 erasers and can make 5 rows of erasers in each row, then she can make... (calculate)...erase rows!
Response:  If Faye has 6 ceruzoks and she wants to divide them equally between two radios, then each radio will get 3 ceruzoks. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  Faye has 35 erasers and she puts them in boxes of 4 each. So, she can make 35/4 = 8.75 boxes. Since each box contains 2 erasers, she can make 8.75 x 2 = 17.5 boxes. Therefore, Faye can make 17.5 boxes of erasers.
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 erasers and she distributed them among 19 pencils in each box. So, we can calculate the number of erasers per pencil as follows: Number of erasers per pencil = Total number of erasers / Number of pencils = 31 / 19 = 1.6 Therefore, there are approximately 1.6 erasers per pencil.
Response:  We know that there are 71 pastels and 24 pencils in each of the 30 rounds. So, we can calculate the number of pencils as follows: Number of pencils = Total number of pastels / Number of rounds x Number of pastels per round Therefore, the number of pencils is: Number of pencils = 71/30 x 24 = 168 pencils
Response:  We have 16 rectangles and each rectangle has 6 pastels and 21 pencils. So, we can calculate the total number of pastels as follows: Total number of pastels = Number of rectangles x Number of pastels per rectangle = 16 x 6 = 96 pastels. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rectangles x Number of pencils per rectangle = 16 x 21 = 356 pencils. Therefore, there are 96 pastels and 356 pencils in total.
Response:  We know that there are 21 students going on the trip and 98 students in total at the school. If all buses are full, then each bus can carry up to 98/21 = 4.6 students. So, there will be 4.6 students in each bus.
Response:  We know that there are 84 students in school and 95 school buses with each bus carrying 118 passengers. So, we can calculate the total number of passengers as follows: Total Passengers = Number of Students + Number of Passengers per Bus x Number of Buses To find out how many students are going on the field trip, we need to subtract the number of passengers who will be traveling on the school buses from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of students going on the field trip is equal to: Number of Students Going on Field Trip = Total Passengers - Number of Passengers per Bus x Number of Buses Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these formulas: Total Passengers = 84 + (95 x 118) = 84 + 10720 = 11560 Number of Students Going on Field Trip = 11560 - (95 x 118) = 11560 - 10720 = 840 Therefore, there are 840 students going on the field trip.
"Response:  We have:
Number of students = 67 (total)
Number of students per class = 66 (per each of the 10 classes)
Total number of classes = 10
Now we need to find out how many buses are needed for the trip. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus:
Capacity of one bus = 6 seats/bus x 66 students/class x 10 classes = 390 students/bus
Since there are more than one bus required for the trip, let's round up the number of buses needed to the nearest whole number:
Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Capacity of one bus = 67 students / 390 students/bus = 4 buses
Therefore, 4 buses are needed for the trip."
Response:  We know that there are 87 students in total and each class has an equal number of students. So, we have 87/5 = 17 classes with 58 students per class. Since each bus can accommodate 2 students, we need 17 x 2 = 34 buses for the trip. Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  We know that there are 24 groups of students and each group has an equal number of students. Therefore, we can write: Number of students in one group = Total number of students / Number of groups = 120 students / 24 groups = 5 students per group. So, there are 5 students in each group or tried.
"Response:  We have: Number of students = 102; Number of buses = 8; Number of students per bus = 8; Total number of students needed for the trip = 102 - 22 = 80. So we need 8 buses for the trip."
Response:  We have 102 students in total and 11 students who do not want to go on the trip. So, we subtract 11 from 102 to get 91. Now, each school bus can hold 99 students, so we divide 91 by 99 to find out how many students will be able to go on the trip per bus. Therefore, 91 / 99 = 9 students will be able to go on the trip per bus. Since there are multiple buses, we multiply the number of students who can go on each bus by the number of buses to find out the total number of students who will be able to go on the trip. Therefore, 9 x 5 (since there are 5 buses) = 45 students will be able to go on the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 students in total and each bus has three seats. So, we need to divide the number of students by the number of seats per bus: 72 / 3 = 24 buses. Since there are 111 students in total, we need 24/3 = 8 buses for this trip. Therefore, 8 buses are needed for the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total. If all the buses are full (which is likely), then each bus can carry at most 92/46 = 2 students. So, there will be 2 students in each bus.
Response:  If Hayley has 11 boys who love playing with marbles and she wants to give each boy 9 marbles, then we need to find out how many marbles Hayley has in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of boys by the number of marbles each boy will get:  Number of marbles = Number of boys x Number of marbles per boy  In this case, the number of boys is 11, so if each boy gets 9 marbles, the total number of marbles Hayley has is:  Total number of marbles = 11 x 9 = 99 marbles So, Hayley has 99 marbles in total.
Response:  If Hayley has 10 marbles and gives 5 to each of 4 boys, then she gave a total of 20 marbles (10 x 5 = 50). So there are 30 marbles left with Hayley (10 - 50 = -40).
Response:  If Hayley has 23 marbles and wants to share them equally among 4 boys, then each boy will get how many marbles?  We can start by dividing 23 by 4 to find out how many marbles each boy will get: 23 / 4 = 5.75 marbles per boy. Since we cannot give fractional marbles, each boy will get 6 marbles (round up). So, Hayley will have 23 - 6 x 4 = 23 - 24 marbles left after sharing with the boys.
Response:  We know that V Haley has 13 children who love playing with cars and 50 children who love playing with dolls. If Haley has 26 gloves, how many gloves will each child get? To find out, we need to divide the total number of gloves (26) by the number of children who like playing with cars (13). So, each child who likes playing with cars will get 26/13 = 2 gloves. Similarly, we can calculate for the other group of children who like playing with dolls. There are 50 such children, so they will get 26/50 = 1 glove each. Therefore, each child will get either 2 or 1 glove depending on their preference.
Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and wants to divide them equally among the boys, then each boy will get 20/5 = 4 marbles.
Response:  If Hayley gave each boy 2 gulicks, and there were 28 gulicks in total, then she gave 14 boys (since 28 / 2 = 14).
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 14 days and the book had 392 pages. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the number of days by the number of pages he read:  Number of pages read per day = Number of days / Total number of pages in the book  In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 392. So, if Frank read his favorite book for 14 days, he must have read:  Number of pages read per day = 14 / 392 = 0.35 pages per day Now, to find out how many days it took Frank to finish reading the entire book, we need to multiply the number of pages read per day by the number of days taken to finish reading the book:  Days taken to finish reading the book = Number of pages read per day x Total number of days taken to finish reading the book  Since Frank read 0.35 pages per day, it took him 392/0.35 = 1146 days to finish reading his favorite book. Therefore, the answer is 1146 days.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. So, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day Total pages = 569 x 22 = 12380 pages Therefore, there are 12380 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish reading his favorite book. So, he read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the number of pages (612) by the time it took him to finish reading the book (6 days).  Therefore, Frank read for approximately 102 pages per day ($612$ / $6$ = $102$).
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 220 days and the book had 555 pages. Since there are 5 chapters in total, each chapter must have a certain number of pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in one chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pages in one chapter = 555 pages / 5 chapters = 111 pages per chapter Therefore, each chapter has 111 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since there are 15 chapters in the book, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total number of days / Number of chapters So, if Frank took 660 days to read the entire book, and there are 15 chapters in total, then he must have spent approximately 44 days (660 / 15) reading each chapter. Therefore, Frank read one chapter every 44 days.
Response:  If Frank took 3 days to read all of the books (3 dni), then he must have read for how many hours per day?  We know that each book had 249 pages, so if Frank read for x hours per day and finished all the books in 3 days, we can set up the equation: x + x + x = 3x  Where x is the number of hours Frank read per day. Solving for x, we get: x = 1 hour/day  So, Frank read one hour per day.
Response:  If Frank took 12 days to read one book, then he read $66$ books in total during those $12$ days. Therefore, the number of books he read per day is $\frac{66}{12} = 5$. Now, if it took him $492$ days to read all the books, then he read $5 \times 492 = 2460$ books in total.
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book, then he read an average of pages per day. Since there are pages in the book, we can calculate how many pages Frank read each day as follows:

pages/day = total pages / number of days taken
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days."
"Response:  If Frank read his favorite book for 8 pages per day and the book had 576 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it took him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 576 / 8
= 72

So, Frank finished reading his favorite book in 72 days."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter had 450 pages and there were 41 chapters in total, we can calculate how many pages Frank read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 41 x 450 = 17,650 pages
= 17,650 / 30 = 589 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 589 pages per day during the 30 days he took to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 607 days and the book had 3 chapters with each chapter having 594 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is: 594 pages / 3 chapters = 198 pages per chapter
"Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Chapters/Day = Total Chapters / Time Taken
= 2 x 405 = 810 chapters

So, Frank read approximately 810 chapters per day."
Response:  If we know that there are 6 DVDs in total and they cost $120 altogether, then each DVD must cost: $$ \frac {120}{6} = 20 $$ dollars per DVD. So, each DVD costs $20.
Response:  If one box of DVDs costs $81, then three boxes will cost $81 x 3 = $243. So, buying 33 boxes of DVDs will cost $243 x 33 = $7,900.
Response:  If each DVD box costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 on each box, then we can buy how many boxes for $93? To find out, let's divide $93 by $106 (the amount of the discount): $93 / $106 = x Where x is the number of boxes we can buy. Now, we need to make sure that x is an integer, since we are buying whole boxes. So, the least common multiple of 106 and 93 is 24. Therefore, we can buy 24 boxes for $93: $93 / $106 = 24.
Response:  The cost of each DVD is $76. If there is a discount of $25 on each DVD, then we need to find out how much we have to pay for each DVD after applying the discount. So, the amount we have to pay for each DVD = Cost of each DVD - Discount on each DVD = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each DVD.
"Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...

$$ \text{Number of DVDs} = \frac{\$104}{\ \$26} $$

So, if you have $104 dollars, you can buy $\frac{104}{26}$ or $4$ DVDs."
Response:  If we want to buy 2 DVD boxes for $28, then each box must cost half of that amount or $14 per box.
Response:  We have 18 bananas and we want to organize them into groups of size 2. To find out how many groups we can make, we need to divide 18 by 2. So, there are 9 groups of bananas that we can make.
"Response:  We have 140 groups of bananas that are not necessarily equal in size. Each group contains 187 bananas. So, we need to find out how many total bananas there are in all 140 groups. To do this, we can use multiplication. The number of bananas in each group is 187, and since we have 140 groups, the total number of bananas is:

$$ \text {Total number of bananas} = \text {Number of bananas in each group} \times \text {Number of groups} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of bananas}} = \boxed{187} \times \boxed{140} = \boxed{26,990} $$

Therefore, there are approximately $26,990$ bananas in the collection."
Response:  We have 203 bananas and 63 oranges. If we divide the bananas into 7 groups of equal size, each group will contain 28 bananas (203 / 7 = 28). Now, if we divide the oranges into 95 groups of equal size, each group will contain 0.66 oranges (63 / 95 = 0.66).
"Response:  We have 142 bananas and 356 oranges. Since we want to group them into equal-sized groups, let's divide both numbers by the number of groups we want to make (in this case, 47 for bananas and 178 for oranges). So, we can calculate the size of each group as follows:
For bananas: 142 / 47 = 3
For oranges: 356 / 178 = 2
So, each group of bananas contains 3 bananas, and each group of oranges contains 2 oranges."
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in total and each group contains an unknown number of bananas. So, we can write the equation: Number of bananas = Total number of groups x Number of bananas per group. In this case, we don't know how many bananas are in each group, so we will use the variable ""x"" to represent it. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into the equation: Number of bananas = 196 x x. Since there are 392 bananas in total, we can set up another equation: 392 = 196x. Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 392 / 196 = 2. Therefore, each group contains 2 bananas."
"Response:  We know that there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection and we want to divide them into groups of size 18. To find out how many groups we can make, we need to divide 180 by 18. So, the number of groups is:

$$ \boxed{180 / 18 = 10} $$
Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We have 87 oranges and 290 bananas. If we divide the bananas into two groups of equal size, then each group will contain half of the total number of bananas, which is 145 (290 / 2). Now, if we divide the oranges into 93 groups of equal size, then each group will contain 9 oranges (87 / 93). Therefore, the size of each group of bananas is 145, and the size of each group of oranges is 9.
"Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in total. If we divide the oranges into groups of size x, then the number of groups is given by:

Number of orange groups = Total number of oranges / Size of each group
= 384 / x

Similarly, if we divide the bananas into groups of size y, then the number of groups is given by:

Number of banana groups = Total number of bananas / Size of each group
= 192 / y

We want to find out what values of x and y will make the number of oranges and bananas in each group equal. So, we set up two equations based on the information provided:

Number of oranges in each group = Number of bananas in each group
x + (1/3)x = 192 + (1/3)(y)

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 345
y = 16

So, there are 345 oranges in each group, and 16 bananas in each group."
Response:  If she prepared 38 Kolacheks and each of them contains 19 pieces, then we can calculate how many total pieces are in all 38 Kolacheks as follows: Total number of pieces = Number of Kolacheks x Number of pieces per Kolacheck  Total number of pieces = 38 x 19 = 702 pieces So, Brenda prepared 702 pieces of Kolaches for her guests.
Response:  If there are 14 people and each of them has 30 Kolacheks, then we have to calculate how many total Kolacheks were prepared. So, the number of Kolacheks = Total number of people x Number of Kolacheks per person = 14 x 30 = 420 Kolacheks.
Response:  We know that Brenda prepared 22 Kolacheks and threw away 17 of them. So, we have 22 - 17 = 5 remaining Kolacheks. Now, let's assume each of these 5 Kolacheks contains an equal number of pieces (e.g., 5 pieces per Kolache). Therefore, the total number of pieces in all 5 Kolacheks is 5 x 5 = 25 pieces.
Response:  If Brenda made 18 Kolacheks and each guest received an equal number of Kolacheks as they are guests, then we can write this equation:  Number of Guests = Total Number of Kolacheks / Number of Guests per Person. In this case, if 9 guests did not come, that means there were 9 fewer people to share the total number of Kolacheks equally among them. So let's calculate it:  Total Number of Kolacheks = 18 (Kolacheks) x 9 (Guests who came) = 162 (Total Number of Kolacheks). Now, let's divide the total number of Kolacheks by the number of guests who came: Number of Guests = 162 (Total Number of Kolacheks) / 9 (Number of Guests who came) = 18 (Number of Guests). Therefore, there were 18 guests in total.
Response:  If Brenda made 14 Kolaches for 2 hosts, then each host received how many Kolaches?  We can divide 14 by 2 to find out that each host received 7 Kolaches.
Response:  If Brenda baked 10 Kolacheks and each guest had 2 suckers, then how many guests did she prepare for in total?  We can calculate this as follows: Total number of guests = Number of Kolacheks x Number of Suckers per Guest. In this case, we have: Total number of guests = 10 x 2 = 20 guests. Therefore, Brenda prepared for 20 guests.
Response:  If there are 42 cookies in total and they are divided equally among two bags, then each bag contains how many cookies?  We can use division to find out:  Number of cookies in each bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags So, if we divide 42 by 2, we get: Number of cookies in each bag = 42 / 2 = 21 cookies. Therefore, there are 21 cookies in each bag.
"Response:  If there are 26 pieces of candy and each piece contains 33 chocolates, then we can calculate how many chocolates there are in total as follows:

Total number of chocolates = Number of pieces x Number of chocolates per piece
= 26 x 33
= 840

So, there are 840 chocolates in total."
Response:  We have 33 cookies and we want to divide them equally among 9 bowls. So, each bowl will contain 33/9 = 3.67 cookies (round up to 4 cookies per bowl). Since Frank made 24 bowls, he has 24 x 4 = 96 cookies left over.
Response:  If Frank has 11 cups of sugar and he wants to have 22 cups, then he needs an additional 11 cups of sugar. So, the number of bags of sugar Frank will need is 22 - 11 = 11.
Response:  We have 2 cups of sugar and we want to divide it equally among two bags. So, each bag will get half of the sugar (1 cup). Now, if we had 16 cups of sugar in total, then each bag would contain 8 cups of sugar (half of 16).
Response:  If Shirley has 25 boxes of trefoils and each box contains 14 shuttlecocks, then we can calculate how many shuttlecocks she needs to deliver as follows: Number of shuttlecocks = Total number of boxes x Number of shuttlecocks per box = 25 x 14 = 350 shuttlecocks Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 350 shuttlecocks.
Response:  If Shirley has 10 foam balls and needs to deliver 5 of them at each stop, then she will need to make 2 trips (since there are only 10 total). So, in total, Shirley will need to make 2 x 5 = 10 stops.
Response:  We have been given that there are 67 grams of regular salt and 9 grams of dietary salt. To find out how many more grams of regular salt there are than dietary salt, we need to subtract the amount of dietary salt from the total amount of salt. So, 67 - 9 = 58 grams. Therefore, there are 58 more grams of regular salt than dietary salt.
Response:  We have 22 grams of regular salt (bežné) and 61 grams of diet salt (dietová). To find out how many more grams of diet salt there are than regular salt, we can subtract their values: 61 - 22 = 39 grams. So, there are 39 more grams of diet salt than regular salt.
"Response:  We have:

* 30 grams of regular salt (NaCl) = 30 x 60 = 1800 milligrams (mg)
* 8 grams of low-sodium salt (NaCl) = 8 x 60 = 480 mg
* 41 grams of sugar = 41 x 60 = 2560 mg

So, in total we have:

1800 + 480 + 2560 = 4740 mg
Therefore, the total amount of salt and sugar is 4740 mg."
"Response:  We have:

Bežné sody = 79 fliaš
Dietové sody = 53 fliaš
Jableky = 42 jabĺk

To find out how many more bežné sody there are than diétove sody, we need to subtract their values:

Number of more bežné sody = Bežné sody - Dietové sody
= 79 - 53
= 26

So, there are 26 more bežné sody than diétove sody."
"Response:  We have:

* 54 grams of dietary salt (NaCl) = 54/0.96 = 56 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl).
* 83 grams of light salt (KCl + NaCl) = 83/0.75 = 109 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl).
* 12 jam sandwiches contain 12 x 1.5 = 18 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl).

Therefore, there are more than 56 grams of sodium chloride in total from all sources. The exact amount is:

Total sodium chloride = 56 + 109 + 18 = 183 grams."
Response:  We know that there were 17 fliers in total and 9 of them were regular salted and sugary snacks. So, we have 9/17 = 0.53 x (number of diet snacks) = 0.53 x 29 = 15.47 diet snacks. Therefore, they had approximately 15-16 diet snacks.
"Response:  We have 19 grams of sodium from the diet and 60 grams of salt (which is equivalent to sodium). So, we need to find out how many grams of salt are in 60 grams of salt. There are 39.847 milligrams of sodium per gram of salt, so:

60 g salt = 60 x 39.847 mg/g = 2356.68 mg sodium

Now, let's compare this amount with the daily recommended intake of sodium:

* For healthy individuals, the American Heart Association recommends limiting daily sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) for adults aged 14-50 years old.
* For those who are at risk for high blood pressure or have kidney disease, the recommendation is to limit sodium intake to 1,500 mg per day.

So, based on these recommendations, if an individual consumes more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day, they may exceed the recommended daily intake. In this case, the answer would be ""more than 2,300 mg""."
Response:  We have 72 grams of regular salt and 32 grams of dietary salt. To find out how many grams are more in dietary salt than in regular salt, we need to subtract their weights from each other: 72 g - 32 g = 40 g. So, there are 40 grams more of dietary salt than regular salt. Now let's convert this amount into number of jalapenos. Since one jalapeno is approximately equal to 1 gram, we can divide the difference between the two amounts by 1 gram: 40 g / 1 g = 40 jalapenos. Therefore, there are 40 more jalapenos in dietary salt than in regular salt.
"Response:  We have:

* 36 jabĺk (apples) = 36 x 100 grams = 3600 grams
* 80 fliaš (potatoes) = 80 x 100 grams = 800 grams
* 54 fliaš (carrots) = 54 x 100 grams = 5400 grams

So, we can see that there are more than 3600 grams of carrots and potatoes combined. In fact, there are almost twice as much carrots as apples! Therefore, the answer is:

More than 3600 grams"
Response:  We know that there were 30 pieces of candy in total and 28 of them were made of sugar. So, we can say that the number of pieces of candy that are not made of sugar is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Now, we need to find out how many pieces of candy are made of diet soda. Since we know that each piece of candy contains either sugar or diet soda, but not both, we can conclude that all 2 pieces of candy that are not made of sugar must be made of diet soda. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy made of diet soda is 2. So, the answer is 2.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 dietary sodium levels and they have 79 grams of salt more than their diets. So we can calculate how much salt they had in total as follows:

Total amount of salt = Number of dietary sodium levels x Amount of salt in each level
= 4 x (79 g - 30 g)
= 4 x 49 g
= 196 g

Therefore, the number of excessive salt intake is 196 grams."
Response:  We have 57 grams of regular salt (NaCl), which is equal to 26/3 = 8.67 grams of dietary sodium and 27/3 = 9 grams of light salt. Therefore, the total amount of salt in grams is: 57 + 8.67 + 9 = 74.67 grams.
Response:  We have three types of salt: bežné (бежне), dietné (диетней), and ľahké (ляхкей). The quantities are given as follows: 81 fliaš bežné, 60 fliaš dietné, and 60 fliaš ľahké. To find out how many more fliaš bežné there are than diétne, we need to subtract the quantity of diétne from the quantity of bežné: 81 - 60 = 21. So, there are 21 more fliaš bežné than diétne.
Response:  We have been given that there are 49 grams of regular salt (bežna soda) and 40 grams of dietary salt (dietová soda). Additionally, we have 6 grams of light salt (ľahka soda). To find out how much regular salt and dietary salt are together, we need to subtract the amount of light salt from the total amount of salt. So, the calculation is as follows: Total amount of salt = 49 + 40 - 6 = 51 grams. Therefore, the number of grams of regular salt and dietary salt together is 51 grams.
"Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace today and it was previously 295 visitors per day, then we can calculate how many more visitors came to the palace today as follows:

Number of additional visitors = Total number of visitors today - Previous daily average
= 317 - 295
= 22

Therefore, 22 more visitors came to Buckingham Palace today compared to the previous days."
Response:  We know that there were 703 visitors in total and that they visited the palace for 25 days. To find out how many visitors came per day, we can divide the total number of visitors by the number of days: 703 / 25 = 28. So, on average, 28 visitors came to the palace per day.
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the previous day and today is Day 2, then the number of visitors today would be 666 + 100 = 766.
Response:  We know that in one day (yesterday), 406 people visited Buckingham Palace.  In order to find out how many visitors came to the palace in the previous days, we need to use the information given in the question. The number of visitors in the past 327 days is equal to the number of visitors in the last day multiplied by 327. So, if 406 people visited the palace yesterday, then the total number of visitors in the past 327 days is: 406 x 327 = 130,520.
Response:  We know that in total, 829 people visited the Buckingham Palace during the last 85 days. Now we need to find out how many visitors came on that particular day. So, if 45 people visited the palace that day, then the number of visitors on that day is:  Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors on that day = 829 / 45 = 18 Therefore, there were 18 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on that particular day.
Response:  We know that in total there were 557 visitors to the palace yesterday and today (including Rachel).  If we subtract the number of visitors from yesterday (188), then we get the number of visitors who visited the palace during the last 57 days. So, the answer is:  557 - 188 = 369
Response:  If there were 600 visitors per day before today and now there are 661 visitors, then the increase in visitors is 66 - 60 = 6. So, the number of visitors today is 6 + 600 = 606 visitors.
Response:  We know that in total there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day. In addition, we are told that the number of visitors in the previous day was 419 and in the day before that it was 103. So, if x is the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace before the day in question, then we can write an equation based on the information given: Number of visitors = 419 + (x - 103) Where x represents the number of days ago when Buckingham Palace was visited. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Using substitution method, we get: 419 + (x - 103) = 92  Subtracting 419 from both sides gives us: x - 103 = 51  Divide both sides by 103 gives us: x = 5  Therefore, the number of days ago when Buckingham Palace was visited is 5 days.
Response:  We know that in one day (yesterday), there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace. In the previous day, there were 471 visitors. And in the day before that, there were 808 visitors. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791. Therefore, during the last 89 days, between 1791 and 471 visitors visited Buckingham Palace.
"Response:  We know that in one day (day X), there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace. In the previous day (day X-1), there were 191 visitors. And in the day before that (day X-2), there were 457 visitors. So, we can write an equation based on these numbers:

Number of visitors in day X = Number of visitors in day X-1 + Number of visitors in day X-2

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

705 = 191 + 457

Simplifying and solving for ""number of visitors in day X"", we get:

Number of visitors in day X = 663

Therefore, the answer is 663."
"Response:  If he already has 159 grams of wax and needs another 628 grams to cover his beard, then we can calculate how many grams he still needs as follows:

Total amount needed = Total amount already available + Amount needed
= 159 g + 628 g
= 787 g

So, he still needs 787 grams of wax."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed for painting is 49 grams and Percy has only 260 grams of wax left. So we can calculate the difference between the total amount of wax needed and the amount of wax Percy has as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = 49 grams
Amount of wax Percy has = 260 grams
Difference = Total amount of wax needed - Amount of wax Percy has
= 49 grams - 260 grams
= -211 grams
Therefore, Percy has -211 grams of wax left."
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed for all the candles is 353 grams and we have 22 grams of wax already. So, to find out how many candles can be made, we need to divide the total amount of wax by the amount of wax required for one candle.  Therefore, the number of candles that can be made = Total amount of wax / Amount of wax required for one candle = 353 grams / 22 grams = 16 candles
Response:  If the bee needs 166 grams of wax and currently has 20 grams, then it needs an additional 146 grams of wax. So, the answer is 146 grams.
Response:  If he has 557 grams of wax and now needs only 17 grams, how much does each pear need? We can divide the total amount of wax by the number of pears to find out: 557 grams / 4 = 139 grams per pear. So each pear needs approximately 139 grams of wax.
"Response:  If he currently has 11 grams of wax and his hair needs 492 grams in total, then we can calculate how much more wax he needs as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = 492 grams
Current amount of wax = 11 grams

So, the difference between the total amount of wax needed and the current amount of wax is:
Difference = Total amount of wax needed - Current amount of wax = 481 grams (492 - 11)
Therefore, he still needs 481 grams of wax."
Response:  If he had filled 90 barrels of oil in 6 days, that means he would have filled 15 barrels per day (90 / 6 = 15).
"Response:  If he had 90 barrels of oil to fill in 5 days and 266 people told him that he could do it, then we can calculate how many barrels he would fill each day as follows:

Barrels filled per day = Total number of barrels / Number of days
= 90 barrels / 5 days
= 18 barrels per day

Therefore, if his favorite uncle allowed himself to be tested for filling 90 barrels of oil in 5 days, he would fill approximately 18 barrels per day."
"Response:  If he had 244 barrels of oil per day and he produced for 146 days, then we can calculate how many barrels he produced in total as follows:

Barrels produced = Number of days x Amount produced per day
= 146 days x 244 barrels/day
= 35,080 barrels
Therefore, the number of barrels of oil that would be filled during the last stop is 35,080 barrels."
"Response:  If he had 221 sudom of hrozno filled in 77 days, then we can calculate how many sudom were filled each day as follows:

Number of sudom filled per day = Total number of sudom filled / Number of days taken to fill them
= 221 Sudom / 77 Days
= 2.9 Sudom/Day
Therefore, there would be approximately 2.9 sudom of hrozno filled every day for 77 days."
"Response:  If he saved his favorite wine after 57 stops and 252 people told him that it would fill 108 barrels per day, then we can calculate how many barrels will be filled in 58 days as follows:

Barrels = Volume of wine / Number of days
= 108 barrels/day x 58 days
= 6344 barrels

Therefore, there will be 6344 barrels of wine filled during 58 days."
Response:  If his favorite has 8 barrels of wine per day and there are 36 grape harvesters working for him, it means that they can fill 8 x 36 = 288 barrels per day. To find out how many days it will take to fill 240 barrels, we need to divide the total number of barrels by the number of barrels filled per day: 240 / 288 = 85 days. Therefore, it will take 85 days to fill 240 barrels of wine.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has an equal number of fish. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of fish in one aquarium = Total number of fish / Number of aquariums Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of fish = 52 Number of aquariums = 26 Substituting these values into the above equation, we get: Number of fish in one aquarium = 52 / 26 = 2 Therefore, each aquarium contains 2 fish.
Response:  We have 40 sea creatures in total and each aquarium has 2 sea creatures. So, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find out how many aquariums there are: 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for marine animals and 10 for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 39 animals. So, to find out how many marine animals Tyler has, we can use the following equation: Number of marine animals = Total number of aquariums x Number of animals in each aquarium Marine animals = 56 x 39 = 2248 Therefore, Tyler has 2248 marine animals.
Response:  We know that there are 74 freshwater tanks and 22 saltwater tanks in total. Each tank has 46 animals. So, we can calculate the number of marine animals as follows: Freshwater tanks have 74 x 46 = 3384 marine animals Saltwater tanks have 22 x 46 = 952 marine animals Total number of marine animals = 3384 + 952 = 4336 Therefore, Tyler has 4336 marine animals.
Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for marine animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 19 animals. So, we need to find out how many animals there are in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of aquariums for each type of animal:  For marine animals: 15 x 19 = 285 animals For freshwater animals: 62 x 19 = 1174 animals In total, there are 285 + 1174 = 1459 animals. Therefore, there are 1459 animals in all.
Response:  If there are 13 pieces in each package and Mom is buying 39 white shirts, then she will have to buy packages of size 39 / 13 = 3 packages. So, Mom will have 3 packages.
"Response:  If Mama buys 66 white dresses and each box contains 3 white dresses, then we can calculate how many boxes she will buy as follows:

66 / 3 = 22
So Mama will buy 22 boxes of white dresses."
"Response:  If Mama buys 28 packages of white t-shirts and each package contains 56 white t-shirts, then we can calculate how many white t-shirts Mama will buy in total as follows:

Total number of white t-shirts = Number of packages x Number of t-shirts per package
= 28 x 56
= 1492

So, Mama will buy 1492 white t-shirts in total."
Response:  If Mama buys 57 packages of white shirts and each package contains 53 white shirts, then she will have bought in total 57 x 53 = 3013 white shirts. However, if she also buys 34 pairs of socks, then she will have 34 + 3013 = 3047 white shirts altogether.
Response:  If Mama is buying 51 white shirts and each pack contains 4 shirts, then...
Response:  If Mama buys 70 white shirts and each bag contains 14 white shirts, then we can calculate as follows: Number of bags = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts in each bag = 70 / 14 = 5 bags. Therefore, there are 5 bags of white shirts that Mama bought.
Response:  We have 4 rectangles with equal number of pencils in each rectangle. So, we can say that there are x pencils in each rectangle. Since there are 36 pencils in total, the sum of the number of pencils in all four rectangles is 36x = 144. Therefore, the number of pencils in each rectangle is 144/4 = 36.

Response:  If every person has 41 pieces of Kolache and you have 53 more pieces of Kolache, then in total, there are 94 pieces of Kolache (41 + 53).
Response:  If we have 14 colačiks and 7 vrečecks with equal number of colačiks in each vrečeck, then we can conclude that each vrečeck has 14/7 = 2 colačiks. Therefore, each vrečeck has 2 colačiks.
Response:  If each person has 3 sweets and you have 21 people, then the total number of sweets is: 3 x 21 = 63 sweets. So, you have 63 sweets.
Response:  We have 15 candies and 52 cookies. To find out how many bags of cookies we have, we need to divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag. If there are 26 cookies in each bag, then: Number of bags = Number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag = 52 / 26 = 2 So, we have 2 bags of cookies.
Response:  We have 28 kolacik and 86 cukriki. If we divide the number of cukriki by the number of kolacik, we get:  Number of cukriki per kolacik = 86 / 28 = 3.07. So, you have approximately 3.07 kolacik for each cucuki.
Response:  Postman must deliver 5 pieces of undeliverable mail to each block. If he delivers 25 letters to each house in a block, there are how many houses in a block?
Response:  If there are 9 pieces of undeliverable mail for each house in every block, then there will be 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of undeliverable mail in total. Therefore, the postman must deliver 180 pieces of undeliverable mail to each block.
Response:  There are 6 homes in one block. So, if the postman has to deliver 24 pieces of undeliverable mail to each home, he will have to deliver a total of 144 pieces of undeliverable mail (24 x 6 = 144). Therefore, the postman needs to give 144 pieces of undeliverable mail to each house.
Response:  The postman is giving away 14 unwanted letters to each house in the block. Since there are 10 houses in the block, the total number of letters he has given away is 14 x 10 = 140 letters. Now, we are told that the postman must give 2 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 10 blocks, so the total number of pieces of unwanted mail he has given away is 2 x 10 = 20 pieces. Therefore, there are 140 - 20 = 120 pieces of unwanted mail left over after the postman has given them all away.
Response:  We have to deliver 32 pieces of undeliverable mail to each block. Since there are 20 houses in each block, we need to divide 32 by 20 to find out how many pieces of undeliverable mail we need for each house. So, we need 1.6 pieces of undeliverable mail per house (32 / 20 = 1.6).
Response:  We have to give 30 pieces of undesired mail to each of the 78 blocks. Since there are 19 homes in Block 1, we must provide 30 x 19 = 570 pieces of unwanted mail to all houses in Block 1.
"Response:  Postman must deliver 8 pieces of undeliverable mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he delivers 32 letters to each house in each block, then the total number of houses in all 55 blocks is:

$$ \text {Total number of houses} = \frac{\text{Number of blocks}}{ \text{Number of houses per block}} $$

Given that there are 55 blocks and postman delivers 32 letters to each house in each block, we can calculate the total number of houses as follows:

$$ \text {Total number of houses} = \frac{55}{32} = 170 $$

Therefore, there are 170 houses in all 55 blocks."
Response:  We have to give 4 pieces of undeliverable mail to each house in every block of 81 houses. Since there are 12 houses in each block, we need to give 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of undeliverable mail in total.
"Response:  The postman must deliver 4 pieces of undeliverable mail to each house in every block among the 16 blocks. Since there are 17 houses in each block, the total number of pieces of undeliverable mail that the postman must give is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total = } 16 \times 4 = 64} $$"
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 gulichoks. To divide them into groups of four, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these numbers.  So, let's calculate it:  Number of groups = Total number of items / 4 (since we want to group in fours)  Total number of items = 10 eggs + 20 gulichoks = 30  Now, we divide 30 by 4: 30 / 4 = 7  Therefore, there will be 7 groups of gulichoks.
Response:  We have 10 gulíčeks and 15 eggs. To divide them into groups of 5 eggs each, we need to find out how many groups we can make. So, we divide 15 by 5: 15 / 5 = 3. Therefore, we will create 3 groups of 5 eggs each.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of 11 each, then she will have to distribute 11 x 2 = 22 eggs among these groups. So, Rebecca has 22 eggs in total.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and 6 spoons. Since we want to divide them into 4 groups, each group will contain how many eggs?  To find out, let's divide 8 (the total number of eggs) by 4 (the number of groups). So, each group will contain 2 eggs. Therefore, there will be 2 eggs in each group.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 acorns and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into 3 groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 15 eggs by 3 groups.  So, if we divide 15 by 3, we get 5. That means each group will have 5 eggs. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 6. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with 18 eggs.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 18 by 6 to see how many groups Rebecca can make.  The result of this calculation is 3. That means Rebecca can make 3 groups of 6 eggs each.  Now let's consider the other ingredients. We have 72 bananas and 66 gulichoks. These ingredients don't affect the number of groups Rebecca can make with her eggs, so we won't include them in our calculations. Therefore, the final answer is 3 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. She wants to divide them into groups of four. So, she will need at least 4 groups. Now we have to calculate how many groups she can make with the remaining items. We have 27 grapes and 99 - 4 = 95 bananas left. Since each group needs 4 bananas, we can make 95 / 4 = 23 groups with the remaining bananas. Therefore, Rebecca will make 4 + 23 = 27 groups in total.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 gulíčeks (which are equal to 3). So we can write it as follows:

Rebecca has 20 eggs = 20 x 1 = 20
Rebecca has 6 gulíčeks = 6 x 3 = 18

Now, let's find out how many eggs Rebecca has more than gulíčeks:

Number of eggs Rebecca has more than gulíčeks = Number of eggs - Number of gulíčeks
= 20 - 18
= 2

So, Rebecca has 2 more eggs than gulíčeks."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 eggs and 12 eggs in total. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20 each, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these eggs. To do this, we can divide the number of eggs (12) by 20: 12 / 20 = 0.6 So, Rebecca can make 0.6 groups of 20 eggs using her 12 eggs. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, Rebecca has more than 5 eggs. The difference between 5 and 0.6 is 4.4 eggs (4 + 0.6). Therefore, Rebecca has 4.4 extra eggs beyond what she started with.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in total and he got 11 points in each round, then we can calculate the number of rounds as follows: Number of rounds = Total score / Score per round = 154 / 11 = 14 rounds So, Luke played 14 rounds of trivial pursuit.
"Response:  If Luke played 177 trivia games and got 46 points in each game, then he scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$

where $x_i$ is the number of points Luke scored in the $i^{th}$ game, which we are given as 46.

So, the total score of Luke is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total score}} = 177 \times 46 = 8392 $$

Therefore, the answer to the question is $8392$."
"Response:  If Luke gained 84 points in two rounds of the game, and he got the same number of points in each round, then we can write an equation as follows:

Luke gained x points in Round 1 and y points in Round 2, where x + y = 84 (given).

Now, let's solve for x and y:

x + y = 84... (1)

Since Luke gained the same number of points in both rounds, we know that x = y. Therefore, we can substitute y = x in Equation (1):

x + x = 84

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 84

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 42

So, Luke gained 42 points in each round."
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each game, then he would have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 22,392 points in the entire game.
Response:  If Luke scored 3 points in each round of the game and he played 78 rounds, then he scored a total of 78 x 3 = 234 points. So, he played 234 / 78 = 3 rounds.
Response:  We know that Emily had 2 pearls and she could make 32 earrings. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of earrings = Total number of pearls / Number of pearls used for each earring. In this case, the total number of pearls is 2 (since Emily had only 2 pearls), and the number of pearls used for each earring is 1 (since one pearl is needed to make one earring). Therefore, we can solve for the number of pearls required per earring as follows: Number of pearls per earring = Total number of pearls / Number of pearls used for each earring Number of pearls per earring = 2 / 1 = 2 So, Emily needed 2 pearls to make one earring.
Response:  We know that Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace has 28 beads. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of beads = Total number of beads / Number of necklaces. In this case, the total number of beads is given as 28 x 11 = 308 beads. Therefore, the number of beads Emily had is 308.
"Response:  If Emily has 16 coral pieces and she wants to make necklaces for her friends, each of which contains 8 coral pieces, then we can calculate how many necklaces she can make as follows:

Number of necklaces = Number of coral pieces / Number of pieces per necklace
= 16 / 8
= 2

Therefore, Emily can make 2 necklaces using the 16 coral pieces she has."
Response:  We know that Emily made 18 necklaces using shells for her friends. Since she had 6 shells in total, we can calculate the number of shells used to make each necklace as follows: Number of shells per necklace = Total number of shells / Number of necklaces = 6 / 18 = 0.33 shells per necklace So, each necklace required approximately 0.33 shells.
Response:  We know that Emily made 4 necklaces with coral beads for her friends. Each necklace contains 5 coral beads. So, in total, Emily made 4 x 5 = 20 coral beads.
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 corals and each bracelet requires 3 corals. To find out how many bracelets she can make, we need to divide the number of corals by the number required for one bracelet. So, 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, Emily can make 2 bracelets using her 6 corals.
Response:  We know that Emily had 5 shells and she made 20 pendants. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of shells = Total number of pendants / Number of pendants per shell. In this case, we have: Number of shells = 20 / 4 (since each pendant requires 4 shells). Therefore, Emily needed 5 shells to make one pendant.
Response:  We know that Emily made 26 necklaces and each necklace contains 2 corals. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of corals = Total number of necklaces x Number of corals per necklace  In this case, we have: Number of corals = 26 x 2 = 52 corals. Therefore, Emily had 52 corals in total.
Response:  We know that 819058 children from the district of Lawrence go to camp and 668278 stay at home. To find out how many children spend their summer vacation in camp compared to those who stayed at home, we need to divide the number of children who went to camp by the total number of children. So, the answer is: Number of children spending their summer vacation in camp = 819058 / (819058 + 668278) x 100% = 34.6%.
Response:  We know that 777622 children stayed at home and 202958 children went to camp. So, we need to find out how many more children stayed at home than went to camp. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children who stayed at home: 777622 - 202958 = 574664. Therefore, there are 574664 more children who stayed at home than went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total and during summer vacation, 629424 of them go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children stayed at home. To do this, we can divide the number of children who went to camp by the total number of children: Number of children staying at home = Number of children going to camp / Total number of children = 629424 / 898051 = 7130 Children stayed at home. Therefore, 7130 children remained at home.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in total and during summer vacation, 274865 of them will be at home. So, we need to find out how many children will go to camp during the break. To do this, we can divide the number of children who will be at home (274865) by the total number of children (313473). This gives us approximately 86% or 0.86. Therefore, around 86% or 29777 children will go to camp during the break.
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children in the district of Lawrence and 455682 of them will go to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who will stay at home as follows: Number of children who will stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who will go to camp Total number of children = 907611 Children in the district of Lawrence - 455682 Children going to camp = 452029 Children staying at home
Response:  We know that 800059 children from Lawrence County go to camp and 828521 children live in Lawrence County. So, if 800059 children went to camp, then 437662 (828521 - 800059) children stayed at home.
Response:  We know that out of 91676 children in the district of Lawrence, 61619 returned home during summer vacation and 30057 did not return home. So, we can calculate the number of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who returned home = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, 30057 children from the district of Lawrence went to camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 34044 children from the district of Lawrence went to camp and 134867 remained at home. Then, we have another group of 424944 children who were from outside the area but attended the camp. So, in total, how many children attended the camp?  Therefore, the answer is 599851.
Response:  We know that 610769 children from the district of Lawrence go to camp and 590796 children stay at home. Additionally, 22 children from the surrounding area participate in the camp. So, we can calculate the total number of children in the district of Lawrence as follows: Total number of children = Number of children who go to camp + Number of children who stay at home - Number of children from the surrounding area who participate in the camp Total number of children = 610769 + 590796 - 22 = 613847 children are in the district of Lawrence. Therefore, there are 613847 children in the district of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that 644997 children from Lawrence County stayed at home and 893835 children went to camp. Additionally, 78 children from the surrounding area participated in the camp. So, we need to find out how many children are in total in Lawrence County. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who stayed at home with the number of children who went to camp: 644997 x 893835 = 57201250. Therefore, there are approximately 57 million children in Lawrence County.
Response:  Adam has 3 apples more than Jackie. So, if Adam has 9 apples, then Jackie has 6 apples (9 - 3 = 6).
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we can subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:  Number of apples Jackie has - Number of apples Adam has = 10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has:  Number of apples Jackie has - Number of apples Adam has = 10 - 8 = 2  So, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  Adam has 6 apples and Jackie has 4 more than Adam, so Jackie has 6 + 4 = 10 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 7 apples. If Adam has 9 apples more than Jackie, then Adam has 9 + 7 = 16 apples in total. So, the number of apples is 16.
Response:  We know that Adam has 12 apples and he shares them equally with Jackie. So, Adam gives 6 apples to Jackie. Now, we need to find out how many apples Adam has left after giving some to Jackie. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples given to Jackie from the total number of apples Adam had initially. Therefore, Adam has 6 + 8 = 14 apples left after sharing them with Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, Adam has x apples and Jackie has 10 - x = 9 apples. Since they have some together, we can write: x + 9 = 18 (total number of apples). Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, Adam has 9 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples, then we can write an equation:

Adam = x > y (1)

We also know that Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples. Therefore, we can write another equation:

Jackie = 89 + 11 = 100 (2)

Now, let's solve for x in Equation (1):

x = Adam - Jackie (3)

Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (3), we get:

x = Adam - (100)

Simplifying, we have:

x = Adam - 100

Therefore, Adam has 51 apples."

Response:  Katie has 78 new horses and her friends have 48 new horses. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new horses.
Response:  Katie has 84 new horses and her friend has 8 new horses. So together they have 92 new horses (Katie + friend). Now, let's find out how many old horses they have. Katie has 19 old horses and her friend has 69 old horses, so their total number of old horses is 88 (Katie) + 69 (friend) = 157. Therefore, the number of new horses that Katie and her friend have together is 92 - 157 = -65.
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old hier and her friends have 41 old hier. So in total they have 80 + 41 = 121 old hier.
Response:  We know that Katie is 57 years old and her friend is 63 years old. So, we can say that Katie is younger than her friend by 6 years (63 - 57 = 6). Therefore, Katie has 6 more years than her friend.
Response:  Katie has 57 new hats and her friends have 34 new hats. So, in total, they have 57 + 34 = 91 new hats. Now, let's find out how many old hats Katie has. According to the question, she has 39 old hats. Therefore, the difference between the number of new hats that Katie has and the number of old hats she has is: 91 - 39 = 52. So, Katie has 52 more hats than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and then he spent some money. So, his remaining amount is less than $60.  Next, we meet Jason who had $19 and after spending some money, he has $33 left. Now, let's compare their amounts of money. Since Jason started with more money than Fred ($19 > $60), Jason must have earned more money from washing cars than Fred did. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Jason earned $24 (=$33 - $9) from washing cars.
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and Jason had $5. So together they have $91 ($86 + $5). Now Fred earned $9 more dollars this week, so he has $90 now ($91 - $9 = $90). And Jason didn't work this week, so he still has $5. Therefore, the total amount of money they have now is $95 ($90 + $5)."
"Response: 
Fred had $19 last week and earned $40 this weekend, so his total amount of money is now $59 ($19 + $40).  Therefore, Fred earned an additional $31 ($59 - $28) this weekend compared to last week."
"Response: 
Fred had $114 last week and spent $22 on Saturday. So he has $92 left ($114 - $22).
Jason had $0 last week and earned $78 over the weekend. Therefore, his current balance is $78.
So, Jason earned $78 over the weekend."
Response:  Fred had $111 last week and earned $23 ($111 - $88) from working. Now he has $115. So, his earnings are $115 - $23 = $92.  Jason had $40 last week and earned $6 ($40 - $34) from delivering newspapers. Now he has $44. So, their total earnings from working is $92 + $6 = $98.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 last week and he earned $73 this week, so his new amount of money is:  $49 + ($73 - $3) = $112.  Now, we know that Jason had $0 last week and he earned $63 this week, so his new amount of money is: $0 + ($63 - $0) = $63. Therefore, the difference between the amount of money that Jason earned and the amount of money that Fred earned from delivering newspapers is: $63 - $112 = -$50. So, Jason earned -$50 from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $78 and now he has $14, so he lost $64.  Next, we know that Fred had $90 and now he has $90 + $14 = $104. So, Fred gained $14. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from delivering newspapers is $14 + $64 = $78.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $33 last week and Jason earned $95 last week.  Secondly, we know that Fred delivered newspapers for $16 and mowed lawns for $74 over the weekend. So, how much money did Fred earn from these activities? To find out, we need to add up the amount he earned from each activity. Therefore, Fred earned $16 + $74 = $90 from his activities over the weekend. Finally, we subtract the amount he spent ($33) from the total amount he earned to get the profit: $90 - $33 = $57. So, Fred made $57 in profits over the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and Jason had $99 last week.  Then, Fred delivered newspapers for $111 and mowed lawns for $34. So, how much money does Fred have now? Well, if he had $47 + $111 = $158 last week, and then he made $34 from mowing lawns, so his new total amount of money is $158 + $34 = $192. Therefore, Fred has $192 now.
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 71 kg and then started running every day, losing 20 kg. So now she weighs... (calculate)...41 kg!
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg. After running for one month, she lost 101 kg. So, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 128 kg (27 + 101).
Response:  Before she started running every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. Now she weighs 66 kg. So, her weight before starting to run daily was 126 kg - 66 kg = 60 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie started running every day and lost 35 kg. Initially, she weighed 69 kg. So, now she weighs... (calculate)...kg.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 114 kg initially and lost 50 kg in the first week, then she weighed 64 kg after one week. In the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so her weight now is 0 kg (since it's not possible to lose more than your initial weight). Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 0 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg. We know that she lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week. So, her weight after one week of running is: 9 + (62 - 7) = 58 kg After two weeks of running, her weight is: 58 + (140 - 7) = 195 kg Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 92 kg initially and lost weight at a rate of 56 kg in the first week and 99 kg in the second week. So, after one week of jogging, she had lost 56 kg = 36 kg. Therefore, her weight after one week of jogging was 92 kg - 36 kg = 56 kg.
Response:  We have 95 birds and 61 alligators in total. If there were 64 hidden birds, then we would have 31 (95 - 64) visible birds left.
Response:  We know that there are 93 hawks and 97 alligators in total. If 40 alligators were hidden, then we can calculate how many alligators were not hidden as follows: Number of alligators not hidden = Total number of alligators - Number of hidden alligators = 97 - 40 = 57 alligators. Therefore, 57 alligators were not hidden.
Response:  We know that there were 30 tigers and 75 alligators in total. If we subtract the number of tigers from the total number of animals, we get:  Number of alligators = Total number of animals - Number of tigers = 75 - 30 = 45 alligators. So, 45 alligators were hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total and we have to find out how many of each type of animal are hiding.  The number of dogs is 24 and the number of alligators is 51. So, if we divide the total number of animals (79) by the number of dogs (24), we get:  Number of dogs = Total number of animals / Number of dogs = 79 / 24 = 3.  Similarly, if we divide the total number of animals (79) by the number of alligators (51), we get:  Number of alligators = Total number of animals / Number of alligators = 79 / 51 = 1.56 (round down to 1). Therefore, there are 3 dogs and 1.56 alligators hiding.

Response:  Yesterday, he picked 154 strawberries and today he picked 50. So in total, he has picked 204 strawberries (154 + 50).
Response:  We know that Farmer has 175 plants in his garden, including 77 vegetables and 98 flowers. If he chooses 172 vegetables, how many flowers does he have left? Solution: Total number of plants = 175. Number of vegetables chosen = 172. Therefore, total number of flowers = 175 - 172 = 3.
Response:  We know that there are 177 parades and 12 earthworks in total. If he selected 53 parades, then we can calculate how many remained as follows: Number of remaining parades = Total number of parades - Number of parades selected = 177 - 53 = 124 parades remain. Similarly, if he selected 53 parades, then the number of earthworks left is: Number of remaining earthworks = Total number of earthworks - Number of earthworks selected = 12 - 0 = 12 earthworks remain. Therefore, there are 124 parades and 12 earthworks left after selecting 53 parades.
Response:  We know that there are 105 green parrots and 71 red parrots in total. If he picked 137 parrots, then we can calculate how many of each color he picked as follows: Green parrots = Total number of green parrots x Number of parrots picked / Total number of parrots Red parrots = Total number of red parrots x Number of parrots picked / Total number of parrots So, to find out how many green parrots he picked, we can use the formula: Number of green parrots = 105 x (137 / 176) = 89 Therefore, he picked 89 green parrots. Similarly, to find out how many red parrots he picked, we can use the formula: Number of red parrots = 71 x (137 / 176) = 49 Therefore, he picked 49 red parrots.
Response:  If 4 clients used 2 pieces of clamps each to hang large wooden boards, then the total number of clamps needed is 8 (4 clients x 2 pieces per client). So, John needs 8 pieces of clamps for the entire wall.
Response:  We know that there are 13 large wooden beams and each beam requires 17 nails to secure it. Therefore, the total number of nails required for all 13 beams is: 13 x 17 = 201 nails. Now we are told that some smaller beams require 8 nails each. So, the total number of nails required for these smaller beams is: 8 x x (where x is the number of smaller beams) =?. Since we don't know the exact number of smaller beams, we can't calculate the total number of nails required yet. But we do know that the total number of nails required for all beams is greater than or equal to 201 nails.
Response:  We know that 11 klincov were used to nail big wooden beams onto the wall of the house. Each beam requires 3 nails, so we need 3 x 11 = 33 nails in total. However, there are also additional 8 nails used for other purposes. So, John needs 33 + 8 = 41 nails to finish the job.
Response:  We know that there are 12 large and 10 small wooden boards in total. To connect them together, we need to use 15 clamps for the large boards and 5 clamps for the small boards. So, John needs 15 + 5 = 20 clamps in total.
Response:  We know that each large wooden beam requires 2 clamps to be secured and fixed to the wall. So, if John used 16 beams, he will need 32 clamps in total. Therefore, John needs 32 clamps for the wall.
Response:  If each wooden beam requires 74 pieces of nails to be secured, and there are 8 large wooden beams in total, then we can calculate the number of nails needed as follows: Number of nails = Total number of wooden beams x Number of pieces of nails per wooden beam So, the number of nails needed is: Number of nails = 8 x 74 = 592 nails Therefore, John needs 592 nails to secure all 8 wooden beams onto the wall.
Response:  We know that there are 12 large boards and 17 small boards in total. Each large board requires 14 nails to be secured, so we need 12 x 14 = 168 nails for the large boards. Similarly, each small board requires 25 nails, so we need 17 x 25 = 425 nails for the small boards. In total, we need 168 + 425 = 593 nails to secure all the boards. Therefore, John needs 593 nails to fix the boards on the wall of his house.
Response:  We know that Robin has pairs of eggs (balíčkov). In each pair, there are three egg whites and a total of 42 egg yolks. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pairs = Total number of egg yolks / Number of egg whites per pair. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pairs = 42 / 3 = 14 pairs. Therefore, Robin has 14 pairs of eggs or 28 individual eggs.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 bags of apples and in each bag there are 23 apples. So, the total number of apples Robin has is: 43 x 23 = 1005 apples. Now we need to find out how many apple boxes Robin has. Since he has 8 extra apples, we can assume that he has one more box of apples than the total number of apples he has. Therefore, the number of apple boxes Robin has is: 1005 / 23 = 44 boxes. So, Robin has 44 apple boxes.
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of candy. So, he has in total 6 + 6 = 12 pieces of candy. Since each bag contains 7 pieces of candy, we can calculate the number of bags as follows: Number of bags = Total amount of candy / Amount of candy per bag = 12 / 7 = 1.71 (approximately). Therefore, Robin has approximately 1.71 bags of candy.
Response:  We know that there are 28 bags of birdseed and 13 bags of chocolate. In each bag, there are 4 pieces of either birdseed or chocolate. So, we can write an equation:  Birdseed = 28/13 = 2 bags per piece Chocolate = 13/4 = 3 bags per piece Now, let's find out how many bags of birdseed Robin has:  Birdseed = 2 x 28 = 56 bags Therefore, Robin has 56 bags of birdseed.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 bags of nuts and 45 bags of chocolates. In each bag, there are 9 pieces of chocolate. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pieces of chocolate = Total number of bags x Number of pieces per bag Therefore, to find out how many pieces of chocolate Robin has, we need to substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pieces of chocolate = (21 + 45) x 9 = 367 pieces of chocolate So, Robin has 367 pieces of chocolate.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 bags of nuts and 14 bags of chocolates. In each bag, there are 6 pieces. So, we can write an equation:

Number of pieces of nuts = Number of bags of nuts x Number of pieces per bag
= 28 x 6
= 168

Similarly, for chocolates:

Number of pieces of chocolates = Number of bags of chocolates x Number of pieces per bag
= 14 x 6
= 84

So, Robin has 168 pieces of nuts and 84 pieces of chocolates in total."
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 t-shirts per minute and it produced a total of 6 t-shirts, then we know that the machine worked for x minutes. We are given that the machine produces 3 t-shirts per minute, so if it worked for x minutes, then the number of minutes it worked is equal to the number of t-shirts it produced divided by the number of t-shirts it can produce per minute:  x = (6 t-shirts) / (3 t-shirts/minute) = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes.
"Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes and produced 4 shirts per minute. So, in total, it produced:

$$ \text {Total number of shirts} = \text{Time taken to produce shirts} \times \text{Number of shirts produced per unit time} $$

Substituting the values given in the question:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of shirts} &= 5 \minutes \times 4 \shirts/minute \\[6pt] &= 20 \shirts \end{aligned} $$
Therefore, the machine produced $20$ shirts during the $5$-minute period."
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 9 trikes and today it produced 44 trikes. So, we can say that the rate of production is increasing day by day. If we divide the total number of trikes produced yesterday by the time taken to produce them, we get the average time taken to produce one trike.  Therefore, the average time taken to produce one trike = Total number of trikes produced yesterday / Time taken to produce them yesterday = 9/1 = 9 minutes.  Now, if we calculate the time taken to produce 44 trikes today, we get the time taken today = Number of trikes produced today x Average time taken to produce one trike = 44 x 9 = 386 minutes.  Therefore, the machine worked for 386 minutes today.
Response:  If yesterday the machine produced 13 T-shirts and today it produced 3 T-shirts, then we can say that the production rate of the machine is decreasing.  Therefore, we will assume that the machine produces 8 T-shirts per minute.  To find out how many minutes the machine worked, we need to subtract the number of T-shirts produced yesterday from the total number of T-shirts produced in one day.  So, if yesterday the machine produced 13 T-shirts and today it produced 3 T-shirts, then the difference between these two numbers is 10 (13 - 3).  Therefore, the machine worked for 10 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 9 trikes and today it produced 8 trikes. So, in total, the machine produced 9 + 8 = 17 trikes. Since the machine produces 2 trikes per minute, the number of minutes the machine worked is 17 / 2 = 8.5 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 8.5 minutes today.
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 t-shirts per minute and yesterday it produced 4 t-shirts, then in total it produced 4 + 4 = 8 t-shirts. And today it produced 8 t-shirts / 60 minutes (1 hour) = 0.133 t-shirts/minute. So, the time it took for the machine to produce all those t-shirts is 0.133 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.0225 hours or approximately 12.5 seconds.
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 trikes per minute yesterday it produced 72 trikes (6 x 12 = 72). Today it produces 90 trikes (6 x 14 = 90), so in total it has produced 72 + 90 = 162 trikes.
Response:  If yesterday the machine could produce 3 t-shirts per minute and today it can produce 12 t-shirts per minute, then we know that the increase in production is 4 times (12 - 3) = 8 t-shirts per minute. So, if the machine produced 5 minutes ago, it would have produced 8 x 5 = 40 t-shirts during that time. Therefore, the number of t-shirts produced today by the machine is 40.
"Response:  We know that they earned $165 in total over 5 days, so we can calculate their daily earnings as follows:
Daily Earnings = Total Earning / Number of Days
= $165 / 5
= $33 per day
Therefore, they earned $33 per day."
Response:  The hawker earned $144 per day selling beads at Carnival. There were 22 days of Carnival. So, how much money did they earn in total? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount earned = Number of days x Daily income Now we need to fill in the values given in the question: Total amount earned = 22 x $144 = $3,088 Therefore, the hawker earned $3,088 during the entire duration of Carnival.
"Response:  We know that they earned $420 in total during Carnival and that they earned $22 together with the game. So, we can calculate how much they earned per day as follows:

Total earnings = $420
Earnings with the game = $22

So, their daily earnings are:
Daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days = $420 / 30 = $14 per day"
Response:  First 44 days = $382 + $374 = $756 Total earnings = $756
Response:  We know that in the first 20 days of Carnival, they earned $120, and in the remaining 16 days, they earned $66. So, to find out how much they earned per day during the first 20 days, we can divide the total amount earned during those days by the number of days: $$ \therefore Total earnings = 120 + 66 = 186$  And now, let's divide the total earnings by the number of days during which they worked: $$ \therefore Earnings per day = 186 / 20 = 9.3$  Therefore, they earned approximately $9.3 per day during the first 20 days of Carnival.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 154 days of carnival, they earned $325. Then, in the remaining 57 days, they earned $114. So, if we calculate the average daily income during those 57 days, we get:  Average Daily Income = Total Earnings / Number of Days = $325 + $114 = $439  Therefore, they earned $439 per day during the last 57 days of carnival.
"Response: 
Lucy bought 10 packages of dumplings and 4 packages of cakes. So far, we have:

* Dumplings: 10 packages x $X = $X
* Cakes: 4 packages x $Y = $Y

We know that the total amount spent by Lucy is equal to the sum of these two amounts:

$X + $Y = Total cost

Can you solve for $Y (the cost of the cakes)?"
"Response: 
Lucy went to the store and bought:
* 4 packages of nuts (balíčky)
* 22 packages of pastries (balíčkov)
* 16 packages of chocolate (balíčkov)

So, in total, Lucy bought:
4 + 22 + 16 = 42 packages of food."
Response:  If Lucy bought 23 bags of nuts and some bags of cookies, then she must have had at least 23 + x bags of cookies where x is the number of bags of nuts she bought. Since each bag of cookies contains 4 cookies, we can write an equation as follows: Number of bags of cookies = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of bags of cookies = (23 + x) \* 4 / 4 = 23 \* 4 + x \* 4  Simplifying the equation, we get: Number of bags of cookies = 92 + x  Therefore, Lucy bought at least 92 bags of cookies.
"Response: 

Lucy went to the store and bought 2 boxes of nuts and 12 boxes of cakes. In total, she purchased 34 units (boxes) of food. Since each box contains 8 small portions, Lucy bought 272 small portions of food in total (34 x 8). Therefore, the answer is 272."
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 people in the bus and then 4 more got into the next stop. So, now we have 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry maximum of 36 people, we have exceeded the capacity of the bus. Therefore, the correct answer is 16 - 36 = -20 people.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 new passengers boarded at the next stop and 3 got off. So, now there are... (calculate)...people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got on board. So, now there are 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 5 more people got on board, so now there are 16 people in the train (11 + 5 = 16).
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents and 676 people in total. To find out how many children were in the program, we need to subtract the number of adults from the total number of people. So, the number of children is:  Number of children = Total number of people - Number of adults  Number of children = 676 - 22  Number of children = 654  Therefore, there were 654 children in the program.
Response:  We are given that there were 73 parents, 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. To find out how many people were involved in total, we need to add these numbers together. Therefore, the number of people involved in the program is: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531. So, there were 1531 people involved in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 children in the program. To find out how many children were present during the comparison with their parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of children. So, the number of children who were present during the comparison is: 521 - 174 = 347.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 children in the program. Since the program was in 44 cities, we need to divide the total number of participants by the number of cities. Therefore, the number of people in the program is: 61 + 177 = 238. So, there were approximately 238 people in the program.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 steps and we need to find out how many steps it takes to reach the end of the cave. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Start Point (in this case, the start point is 0). So, if we assume that one step in the cave is equal to 1 foot, then the distance traveled would be: Distance = 1 ft/step x 1307 stôp = 1307 feet. Therefore, it would take approximately 1307 feet or 400 meters to reach the end of the cave from its starting point.
Response:  The distance traveled is given as $1218$ steps and they are currently at $849$ steps. If they travel at a speed of $17$ steps per minute, how long will it take them to reach the end of the cave? We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the time taken will be: Time = $1218$ steps / $17$ steps/minute $\approx 70$ minutes. So, it will take them approximately $70$ minutes to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that the height of the cave is 659 steps and the depth is 762 steps. To find out how long it will take to reach the end of the cave, we need to divide the depth by the height. So, the time it takes to reach the end of the cave is:  Time = Depth / Height = 762 / 659 = 1.14 hours. Therefore, it will take approximately 1 hour and 14 minutes to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that Paige had originally 8 goldfish in her jar and she gave 6 of them to Zloudice. So, the number of goldfish left with Paige is 8 - 6 = 2. Now, we are asked how many goldfish disappeared (or were eaten). Since Zloudice did not eat any goldfish, the answer is 0. Therefore, the correct answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 guppies in the pond initially. The cats ate some of them, but we don't know how many. So let's assume that the cats ate half of the goldfish (3.5 goldfish) and one-third of the guppies (4 guppies). Therefore, after the cats ate them, Paige had 3.5 + 4 = 7.5 fish left in the pond. Now, we are told that there were originally 15 fish in the pond, so the number of fish that disappeared is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5. Therefore, 7.5 fish disappeared due to the cats eating some of them.
"Response:  We know that Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 silver fish in the pond. The cats ate some of them, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that the cats ate half of the goldfish (8 goldfish). Now, we have:

Goldfish left = 16 - 8 = 8
Silver fish left = 71

So, there are 8 goldfish and 71 silver fish left in the pond."
Response:  We know that Paige caught 15 goldfish in the pond and that some of them were eaten by the cat.  Since 5 were already eaten, we can assume that the number of remaining goldfish is equal to the total number minus the number eaten. So, the number of remaining goldfish is: 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  At first, there were 43 apples and the chef took 2 apples from him. So, now there are 41 apples left with the chef.
Response:  If one chef made 58 dumplings and used 35 of them to make a colach, then we have 23 remaining dumplings (58 - 35 = 23).
Response:  The chef had 40 apples and 54 bread rolls after making a coleslaw. After he made the coleslaw, he had 39 items left. Therefore, the number of apples used to make the coleslaw is 39 - 40 = -1. So, the chef did not use any apples to make the coleslaw.
Response:  If Adam has 11 action figures per shelf and his room has 4 shelves, then he has a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures in his room. Since there are 40 secret compartments in the room, each shelf can hold at most 40 / 4 = 10 action figures. Therefore, Adam's police (or walls) can have at most 44 / 10 = 4.4 action figures.
Response:  If Adam has 10 action figures in his room and each shelf can hold 8 action figures, then we need to find out how many shelves he has in his room. So, if he has 10 action figures and each shelf can hold 8 action figures, then he must have 2 shelves (10 / 8 = 2). Therefore, his room has 2 shelves that can hold action figures.
Response:  We know that there are 8 action figures and 10 small boxes in total. Since each box can hold 2 figures, we need to divide them equally among the 4 shelves. Therefore, we will have: 8/4 = 2 figures per shelf. So, there will be 2 x 4 = 8 figures displayed on the shelves in Adam's room.
Response:  We know that in each of the ten gardens there are 544 henhouses. Each henhouse has 32 flowers. So, we can calculate how many flowers there are altogether as follows: Total number of henhouses = Number of gardens x Number of henhouses per garden = 10 x 544 = 5,440 henhouses Total number of flowers = Number of henhouses x Number of flowers per henhouse = 5,440 x 32 = 17,680 flowers Therefore, there are 17,680 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 466 hours in total and each hour has 53 flowers and 181 leaves. So, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total hours x Flowers per hour = 466 x 53 = 24,980 flowers Now, let's calculate the number of leaves: Number of leaves = Total hours x Leaves per hour = 466 x 181 = 87,360 leaves Therefore, there are 24,980 flowers and 87,360 leaves in the garden.
Response:  We know that each hernia has 71 flowers and 91 stalks. So, if we multiply these numbers together, we get: 71 x 91 = 6311. Therefore, there are 6311 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that each basket has 40 flowers. So, in total, there are 40 x 4 = 160 flowers in all baskets together. Therefore, there must be 400 / 160 = 25 baskets.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 pieces of gum in total. If we divide them into groups of 154 each, then the number of groups is given by:

Number of groups = Total number of items / Number per group
= 4502 + 4276
/ 154

So, there will be approximately 289 groups of Skittles and gum if they are divided equally."
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 pieces of gum. Since we want to organize the gum into groups of equal size, let's divide it evenly among all the Skittles. So, each Skittle will have 495/3941 = approximately 0.126 gum pieces associated with it. Therefore, the size of each group is approximately 0.126.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and Steven has 517 pieces of gum. So, we have a total of 896 + 517 = 1413 items. Now, if we divide these items into 8 groups of equal size, each group will contain 1413 / 8 = 176 items. Therefore, the size of each group is 176.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has an equal number of students as there are classes. So, if there are x classes, then the total number of students is 270x. Since we have 5 students in each class, the total number of students in one class is 5x. Therefore, the number of students in all the classes together is 270x - 5x = 265x.
Response:  We know that there are 304 schools in total and each school has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of schools x Number of students per school. In this case, the total number of students is equal to 304 schools multiplied by 75 students per school, which gives us: Total number of students = 304 x 75 = 22,500 students. Therefore, there were approximately 22,500 students in all the schools combined.
