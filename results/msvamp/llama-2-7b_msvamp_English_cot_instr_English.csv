"Response:  If Bobby ate ""some"" pieces of candy initially and later ate 25 more, that means he ate a total of 25 + initial amount = 43 pieces of candy. So, the number of pieces of candy Bobby ate initially is equal to 43 - 25 = 18 pieces of candy.";
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy and later ate 42 more. So, in total, he ate 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. Then, he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 70 (candy) + 63 (chocolate) = 133.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy, so he already had 33 + 0 = 33 pieces of candy. Then, he ate 4 more pieces of candy, which means he now has 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Next, he ate 14 pieces of chocolate, bringing his total to 37 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and chocolate. So, in summary, Bobby ate altogether 33 + 4 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and later ate 36 more. So, in total, he ate 38 + 36 = 74 pieces of candy. Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the number of pieces of candy and chocolate that Bobby ate is: 74 - 16 = 58 pieces of candy.;
Response:  Bobby initially had 20 pieces of candy and ate 34 pieces, so he now has 20 - 34 = -14 pieces of candy. Then, he ate another 18 pieces, so he now has -14 + 18 = 3 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby ate 3 pieces of candy in total.;
Response:  Bobby initially had 21 pieces of candy and ate 5 pieces, leaving him with 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, bringing the total number to 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy. So, Bobby has 25 pieces of candy left.;
Response:  If Bobby initially had 22 pieces of candy and later ate 5 more, that means he now has 22 + 5 = 27 pieces of candy in total. However, we are told that he still has 8 pieces of candy left, which implies that he must have eaten 27 - 8 = 19 pieces of candy initially. Therefore, the correct answer is 19.;
Response:  Bobby initially had 19 pieces of candy and then ate 2 pieces. So now he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy remaining. Therefore, Bobby still has 17 pieces of candy left.;
Response:  We know that Bobby initially had 32 pieces of candy and after eating some of them, he was left with 20 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows: 32 - x = 20 where 'x' represents the number of pieces of candy that Bobby ate. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can use subtraction. Subtracting 32 from both sides gives us: x = 12. Therefore, Bobby ate 12 pieces of candy.;
Response:  Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy and then ate 17 pieces. So, he has 36 - 17 = 19 pieces of candy left. Then, he ate another 15 pieces, so now he has 19 - 15 = 4 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby still has 4 pieces of candy left.;

Response:  Allan had 2 balloons, and Jake had 3 balloons. To find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan, we need to subtract the number of balloons Allan has from the number of balloons Jake has: 3 (Jake) - 2 (Allen) = 1. So, Jake had one more balloon than Allan at the park.;
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons to the park. So Jake must have brought x balloons. Since we are given that Allan brought 2 balloons, we can write an equation as follows: 2 + x = 3 (balloons). Now solve for x using basic arithmetic. 
x = 1 (balloon)";
Response:  Jake brought 6 balloons initially and then added 4 more, so he brought a total of 10 balloons (6 + 4) to the park. Therefore, Allan must have brought x balloons to the park, where x is equal to 10 minus the number of balloons that Jake brought. In this case, x = 10 - 6 = 4. So, Allan brought 4 balloons to the park.;
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park, then Jake brought 6 more balloons = 6 + 5 = 11 balloons. Therefore, Jake brought 11 balloons to the park.;

Allan has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons now.
Jake had 6 balloons initially, so he still has 6 - 0 = 6 balloons.
Therefore, Jake has 6 more balloons than Allan in the park.";
Response:  Allan initially brought 5 balloons + Jake brought 4 balloons = 9 balloons. Then, Allan purchased additional 3 balloons, so now he has 9 + 3 = 12 balloons in total. Therefore, Allan brought 12 balloons to the park.;
Response:  Allan had 6 balloons initially, while Jake had 2 balloons initially. Then, Jake purchased additional 3 balloons at the park. So, now Jake has 5 balloons (2 + 3). To find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake, we need to subtract the number of balloons Jake got from the total number of balloons Allan had: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Allan had one more balloon than Jake at the park.;
Response:  Allan had 6 balloons initially, and Jake had 3 balloons initially. Then, Jake purchased 4 additional balloons at the park, so he now has 7 balloons (3 + 4). To find out how many more balloons Jake has than Allan, we subtract the number of balloons Allan had from the number of balloons Jake had: 7 - 6 = 1. So, Jake has one more balloon than Allan at the park.;
Response:  Allan brought 5 balloons initially, so Jake had 6 + 5 = 11 balloons in total when he arrived at the park. Then, Jake purchased 3 additional balloons, bringing his new total to 11 + 3 = 14 balloons. So, Jake brought 14 balloons to the park.;
Response:  Allan has 3 balloons + Jake has 5 balloons = Total number of balloons = 8 (balloons). Similarly, for balls, we can calculate as follows: Allan has 20 balls + Jake has 59 balls = Total number of balls = 79 (balls). So, Allan had 8 balloons and Jake had 79 balls at the park.;
Response:  Allan has 7 balloons and 5 balls, so he has a total of 12 items (7 + 5 = 12). Jake has 6 balloons and 4 balls, so he has a total of 10 items (6 + 4 = 10). Therefore, Allan and Jake together have 22 items at the park (12 + 10 = 22).;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Allan brought 5 balloons to the park. If Allan and Jake together brought a total of 6 balloons to the park, then Jake must have brought x balloons to the park, where x is the difference between 6 and 5 (i.e., 1). Therefore, Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.;
Response:  Allan had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons at the park. Jake had 6 balloons at the park. So, Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan at the park.;
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To determine how many additional hours he devotes to studying English compared to Chinese, we must subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total amount of time devoted to studying English. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is 6 - 2 = 4 hours. So, Ryan spends four more hours each day studying English than he does studying Chinese.;
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To determine how many additional hours he devotes to studying Chinese compared to English, we must subtract the number of hours spent studying English from the total amount of time devoted to studying Chinese. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is 7 - 6 = 1 hour. So, Ryan spends one extra hour each day studying Chinese rather than English.;
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and an additional amount of time (not specified) studying Chinese. So, in total, Ryan studies English for 3 hours/day + x hours/day = 4 hours/day. Since we know that Ryan studies both languages daily, we can write the equation as follows: 3h + x = 4h where h represents one hour. Solving for x gives us: x = 1 h = 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour each day studying Chinese.;
"Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and x hours per day studying Chinese. He spends 2 hours more on studying English than on studying Chinese, so he spends (x + 2) hours per day studying Chinese. 
Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and (x + 2) hours per day studying Chinese.";
"Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying Chinese and additional hours studying English. He spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. So, the number of hours he spends on learning English is equal to the total number of hours he spends on learning both languages minus the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese. 
Hence, Ryan spends 5 + (2 - 5) = 7 hours on learning English each day.";
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and Chinese. So, over five days, he will study English for a total of 6 x 5 = 30 hours and Chinese for a total of 7 x 5 = 35 hours. In conclusion, Ryan studies English for 30 hours and Chinese for 35 hours altogether.;
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and Chinese. So, over two days, he will study for a total of 12 hours (6 hours x 2 days). Therefore, Ryan studies 6 + 6 = 12 hours of English each day.;
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English, so over six days, he will have spent a total of 30 hours (5 x 6) studying English. Similarly, he spends 4 hours each day studying Chinese, which means he has studied Chinese for a total of 24 hours (4 x 6). So, altogether, Ryan has spent 54 hours (30 + 24) studying both languages.;
"Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese. To calculate how much time he will spend in total over an 86-day period, we can multiply his daily study time by the number of days:

English: 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours (Total)
Chinese: 6 hours/day x 86 days = 510 hours (Total)
To determine how much time Ryan spends on each subject each day, divide the total amount of time spent on that subject by the number of days:

English: Total hours / Number of days = 352 hours / 86 days = 4.1 hours/day
Chinese: Total hours / Number of days = 510 hours / 86 days = 5.9 hours/day";
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, so in one week (7 days), he will have studied English for a total of 42 hours (6 x 7). Similarly, he studies Chinese for 7 hours per day, which translates to 49 hours in a week (7 x 7) and Spanish for 3 hours per day, resulting in 21 hours in a week (7 x 3). So, altogether, Ryan spends 102 hours each week studying English, Chinese, and Spanish.;
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which means he studies it for a total of 1440 minutes (6 hours x 24 hours). He also spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese, which equals to 720 minutes (3 hours x 24 hours) in one day. Now, we need to find out how many more hours Ryan spends studying English compared to Chinese. To do this, we subtract the number of hours spent studying Chinese from the total number of hours spent studying both languages: 1440 - 720 = 720 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 720 more hours studying English than he does on Chinese.;
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English, which means he studies it for x hours in total. He also spends 2 hours daily studying Chinese, so he has studied Chinese for y hours overall. Finally, he devotes 4 hours each day to Spanish, resulting in z hours of study time overall. To determine how much more time Ryan spends studying English than Spanish, we can use the formula: (x - z) = (y + 2). Solving this equation gives us x = 108 hours, indicating that Ryan spends 8 more hours studying English than Spanish.;
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours per day studying English, so in one week (7 days), he will have studied for a total of 14 hours (2 x 7). Similarly, he studies Chinese for 5 hours per day, which means he has studied for a total of 35 hours in a week (5 x 7). And finally, he studies Spanish for 4 hours per day, which translates to a total of 28 hours of study time in a week (4 x 7). So, Ryan spends more hours studying Chinese than he does studying Spanish. The difference between these two amounts is 7 hours (35 - 28 = 7). Therefore, Ryan spends 7 more hours studying Chinese than he does studying Spanish.;
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and Chinese. If he spends 2 hours daily on learning English, then he devotes x hours to studying Chinese. To solve for x, we can divide 3 by 2 = 1.5 hours. So, Ryan dedicates 1.5 hours each day to mastering Chinese.;
Response:  Ryan spent 4 hours per day studying English, so he studied it for a total of 28 hours (4 h/d x 7 d). Similarly, he studied Chinese for 35 hours (5 h/d x 7 d). So, in total, Ryan studied English for 28 hours and Chinese for 35 hours.;
Response:  Tiffany collected $8$ bags of cans on Monday and then found $7$ additional bags of cans the next day. So, in total, Tiffany collected $8 + 7 = 15$ bags of cans. Therefore, there are $15 - 8 = 7$ more bags that Tiffany had on Monday than she found on the next day.;
"Response:  Tiffany collected $X$ bags of cans on Monday and then found $Y$ more bags worth of cans on the next day. So, in total, Tiffany collected $\boxed{X + Y}$ bags of cans. 
Therefore, the difference between the number of bags Tiffany found on the next day and the number of bags she had on Monday is:
$$\boxed{Y - X}$$";
Response:  Tiffany collected 4 bags of cans on Monday and then found additional bags worth of cans on the next day. So, let's assume that the number of bags she found on the next day is x. Since we know that the total number of bags Tiffany collected is 6, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + x = 6. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations. We get x = 2. Therefore, Tiffany found 2 additional bags of cans on the next day.;
Response:  Tiffany collected $X$ bags of cans on Monday and then found $4$ additional bags worth of cans on the next day. So, in total, Tiffany had $\boxed{X + 4}$ bags of cans. Since we are asked to find out how many bags Tiffany had on Monday, we can conclude that $\boxed{X = 7}$. Therefore, Tiffany had $7$ bags of cans on Monday.;
Response:  Tiffany collected 10 bags of cans on Monday, then found 3 more bags of cans on the next day, which means she now has 10 + 3 = 13 bags of cans in total. Then, on the third day, she found another 7 bags of cans, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 bags of cans altogether. Therefore, Tiffany had 20 bags of cans altogether.;
Response:  Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans on Monday. On the next day (Tuesday), she found 10 more bags of cans, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 bags of cans. Then, on Wednesday (the day after that), she found 4 more bags of cans, bringing the total number to 18 + 4 = 22 bags of cans. Therefore, Tiffany found 22 bags of cans after Monday.;
Response:  Tiffany collected 3 bags of cans on Monday, then found 7 more bags of cans + 44 bags of bottles = 51 bags in total. So, Tiffany had 3 + 51 = 54 bags of cans altogether.;
"Response:  The total number of peaches is 33 (17 + 16). To find out how many more red peaches there are than green peaches, we need to subtract the number of green peaches from the total number of peaches. So, the difference between red peaches and green peaches is:

Number of red peaches - Number of green peaches = 17 - 16 = 1

Therefore, there are one more red peach than green peach in the basket.";
"Response:  The number of red peaches is 5, and the number of green peaches is 11. To find out how many more green peaches there are than red peaches, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches:

11 - 5 = 6

So, there are 6 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket.";
Response:  The question states that there are 10 red peaches and some additional green peaches in the basket. So, we can assume that the number of green peaches is greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, the total number of peaches in the basket = 10 + x, where x is the number of green peaches. Since there are 15 peaches in the basket, we can set up the equation : 10 + x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 5. So, there are 5 green peaches in the basket.;
"Response:  We know that there are 3 red peaches and some more green peaches in the basket. So, let's assume that the number of green peaches is x. Since there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 3 = 4 (green peaches)
Now, solve for x using the above equation.
x = 7 (green peaches)
Therefore, there are 7 green peaches in the basket.";
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red peaches, 15 yellow peaches, and 8 green peaches in the basket. So, we can write this as follows:

Red peaches = 7
Yellow peaches = 15
Green peaches = 8
Total number of peaches = Red + Yellow + Green
= 7 + 15 + 8
= 20
Therefore, there are 20 peaches in the basket.";
Response:  The total number of peaches is 7 + 71 + 8 = 156. Now, we need to find out how many green peaches there are compared to red peaches. So, let's divide the number of green peaches (8) by the number of red peaches (7): 8 / 7 = 1.14. Therefore, there are 1.14 times as many green peaches as red peaches in the basket.;
"Response:  According to the query, there are 2 red peaches, 6 yellow peaches, and 14 green peaches in the basket. To determine how many additional green peaches than yellow peaches are in the basket, we must subtract the number of yellow peaches from the total quantity of green peaches. Therefore, the response is:
More green peaches = 14 - 6 = 8.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 19 red peaches, 11 yellow peaches, and 12 green peaches in the basket. To find out how many more red peaches than yellow peaches are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of yellow peaches from the number of red peaches. So, let's do that:

Number of red peaches = 19
Number of yellow peaches = 11

Now, let's subtract the number of yellow peaches from the number of red peaches:

More red peaches than yellow peaches = Number of red peaches - Number of yellow peaches
= 19 - 11
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 more red peaches than yellow peaches in the basket.";
"Response:  The total number of peaches is 6 + 90 + 16 = 172 peaches. Since there are three colors of peaches, we can find out how many each color has as follows: Red peaches - 6/172 = 34; Yellow peaches - 90/172 = 52; Green peaches - 16/172 = 8. Therefore, there are 34 red peaches, 52 yellow peaches, and 8 green peaches in the basket.";
Response:  The total number of peaches is 18 + 14 + 17 = 59. Now, we need to find out how many red and yellow peaches there are separately. We can do this by dividing each category into equal parts based on their respective numbers. For example, if there are 18 red peaches, then they make up 30% of all peaches (18/59 x 100%). Similarly, if there are 14 yellow peaches, they make up 23% of all peaches (14/59 x 100%). Therefore, there are 18 red peaches and 14 yellow peaches in the basket.;
Response:  The total number of peaches is 5 + 14 + 6 = 25. Since there are 6 green peaches, we can say that the remaining peaches are either yellow or red. So, the number of yellow peaches is 14 - 6 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 yellow peaches and 6 green peaches in the basket.;
Response:  If there are 65 baskets of peaches, then the total number of peaches is 65 x 10 = 650 peaches. Now, we know that each basket contains 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. So, if we divide the total number of peaches (650) by the number of peaches in each basket (7 + 3), we get: Number of peaches in each basket = 650 / (7 + 3) = 650 / 10 = 65 peaches per basket. Therefore, there are 65 peaches in each basket.;
Response:  The total number of peaches is equal to the sum of the number of red peaches plus the number of green peaches. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Number Of Peaches = (Number Of Red Peaches) + (Number Of Green Peaches). Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Total Number Of Peaches = (10 x 11) + (18 x 11). Simplifying the expression, we get: Total Number Of Peaches = 110 + 198. Therefore, there are 308 peaches in the baskets altogether.;
Response:  There are six baskets of peaches. Each basket contains 16 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So, the total number of red peaches is 6 x 16 = 96 red peaches. Similarly, the total number of green peaches is 6 x 18 = 108 green peaches. Therefore, the total number of red peaches in all six baskets is 96, and the total number of green peaches is 108.;
Response:  There are seven baskets of peaches. Each basket contains ten red peaches and two green peaches. To find out how many total green peaches are in all seven baskets, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of green peaches per basket. So, the total number of green peaches is 7 x 2 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 green peaches in all seven baskets of peaches.;
Response:  If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, then the number of red peaches is 4 x = 4n, where n is the number of baskets. Since there are 3 green peaches in each basket, the number of green peaches is 3 x = 3n. Therefore, the total number of peaches in all baskets is 4n + 3n = 7n. So, there are 7 baskets of peaches.;
Response:  If there are 2 baskets of peaches, then there are 2 x 12 = 24 peaches altogether. Since each basket has 4 red peaches, there are 2 x 4 = 8 red peaches in total. So, the number of green peaches in each basket is 24 - 8 = 16. Therefore, there are 8 green peaches in one basket and 8 + 8 = 16 green peaches in the other basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 peaches in the basket altogether. Of those, 13 are red peaches. So, the number of green peaches is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green peaches in the basket.;
"Response:  The total number of peaches in all 15 baskets is equal to the sum of the number of red peaches plus the number of green peaches in each basket. So we can write an equation as follows:
Total Number Of Peaches = (Number of Red Peaches + Number of Green Peaches) x Total Number of Baskets
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
Total Number Of Peaches = (19+4) x 15
= 230
Therefore, there are 230 peaches in all 15 baskets together.";
Response:  If there are 10 peaches altogether, then there will be 5 peaches that are not red (since 4 x = 20). So, there must be 3 baskets with only green peaches (6 x = 18). Therefore, there are 3 + 5 = 8 baskets of peaches overall.;
Response:  The total number of peaches is 6 + 60 + 2 = 78. Since there are 3 different colors of peaches, we can assume that each color has an equal number of peaches. So, if there are x green peaches, then there are also x yellow peaches and x red peaches. We know that there are 6 green peaches, so x = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 4 action figures on the shelf, so that means he already has 4 action figures. Then, he added some more action figures to the shelf, which brings us to a total of 8 action figures. Therefore, Jerry added 4 action figures to the shelf (the difference between the initial number and the new total).;
"Response:  Jerry already has ""some"" action figures on the shelf before adding any new ones. So, let's say he initially had x action figures on the shelf. Then, he adds 7 more action figures to the shelf, bringing the total number of action figures to 10. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 7 = 10... (1)
Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method. For example, you could use substitution by rewriting the equation as:
x = 10 - 7
Therefore, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.";
Response:  Jerry initially had 4 action figures on the shelf, so that is 4. Then, he added 6 more action figures, bringing the total number of action figures on the shelf to 10 (4 + 6). Therefore, there were 10 action figures on Jerry's shelf altogether.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 5 action figures and 9 books on the shelf. So, there are 5 + 9 = 14 items on the shelf altogether. Later, Jerry added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 5 + 9 + 7 = 21 items on the shelf. Therefore, there are 21 - 9 = 12 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 2 action figures and 10 books on the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf was 2 + 10 = 12. Later, Jerry added 4 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the difference between the number of action figures and books on the shelf is 10 - 6 = 4 books.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 9 books on the shelf. Later, he added 10 more books, so now there are 9 + 10 = 19 books on the shelf altogether. Therefore, the correct answer is 19 books.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 7 action figures and 2 books on the shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf, so now there are 2 + 4 = 6 books on the shelf. Since we know that Jerry has 7 action figures, this means that for every book on the shelf, Jerry has 1 action figure. Therefore, if there are 6 books on the shelf, Jerry must have 6 x 1 = 6 action figures on the shelf. So, Jerry has 6 more action figures than books on his shelf.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 5 action figures and 2 books on the shelf, so there are 7 items total (5 + 2 = 7). Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf, bringing the new total number of items to 16 (7 + 9 = 16). Therefore, there are 9 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf (16 - 7 = 9).;
Response:  Jerry initially had 8 action figures on the shelf. Later, he added 4 new action figures, so now there are 12 (8 + 4) action figures on the shelf. Then, he removed 5 old action figures from the shelf, leaving him with 7 action figures remaining. Therefore, the total number of action figures that Jerry had on his shelf at the end was 7.;
Response:  Jerry initially had three action figures on the shelf, so that means he had 3 - 3 = 0 action figures removed from the shelf originally. Later, he added four new action figures to the shelf, bringing the total number of action figures to 3 + 4 = 7. So, Jerry removed zero action figures from the shelf.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 7 action figures on the shelf. Then, he added some new action figures to the shelf, but we don't know exactly how many he added. Later, he removed 10 of the old action figures from the shelf. So, after removing 10 old action figures, Jerry had 8 action figures left on the shelf. To find out how many action figures Jerry added to the shelf, we need to subtract the number of action figures he removed (10) from the total number of action figures he initially had (7). Therefore, Jerry added 6 action figures to the shelf (7 - 10 = 6).;
Response:  Jerry started with x action figures on the shelf. He then added y new action figures (for a total of z = x + y). Later, he removed 7 of the original action figures, leaving z - 7 = x action figures on the shelf. So, Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 9 action figures and 10 books on the shelf. Later, he added 7 more action figures, so now there are 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures is greater than the number of books by 16 - 10 = 6.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 3 books and 4 action figures on the shelf, so there are altogether 3 + 4 = 7 items on the shelf. Later, he added 2 more action figures, bringing the total number of action figures to 4 + 2 = 6. So, the difference between the number of action figures (6) and the number of books (3) is 6 - 3 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.;
Response:  Jerry initially had 7 books and 3 action figures on the shelf, so there are 7 + 3 = 10 items total. Later, he added 2 more action figures, bringing the total number of action figures to 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the difference between the number of books (7) and the number of action figures (5) is 7 - 5 = 2. So, Jerry has 2 more books than action figures on his shelf.;
Response:  The initial two birds are already on the fence, so they count as bird #1 and bird #2. When additional birds arrive, we have a complete of six birds on the fence. So, the number of extra birds that arrived is equal to six minus the original two birds (or five new birds). Therefore, the response is five.;
"Response:  The initial number of birds on the fence was 3 (the phrase ""there were some birds sitting on the fence"" implies that there were already some birds present). Then, 4 additional birds arrived to join them, bringing the overall number of birds on the fence to 7 (5 + 2 = 7). So, initially, 3 birds sat on the fence.";
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 46 storks sitting on the fence. So, in total, there were 4 + 46 = 50 creatures sitting on the fence. Now, when 6 more birds came to join them, we have 50 (initial number) + 6 = 56 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final answer is 56 birds and storks sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that initially there were three birds and two storks sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 creatures sitting on the fence. Now, five more birds come to join them, so now we have 5 + 5 = 10 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 10.;
"Response: 
There are three birds already sitting on the fence initially. Then two more birds come to join them, making it five in total (three + two). Now, there are four storks who have not moved from their original position. So, the number of birds sitting on the fence is five - four = one more bird than storks. Therefore, there is one more bird than storks sitting on the fence.";
Response:  The total number of birds initially was 2 + 6 = 8. Then, three more birds joined them, making it 8 + 3 = 11. Now, there are more storks than birds sitting on the fence. So, the final answer is 6 (storks) - 8 (birds) = -2.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence. So, in total, there were 10 creatures (birds + storks) sitting on the fence. When two additional storks arrived, we now have 10 + 2 = 12 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 12 storks sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that initially there were three birds and four storks sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 creatures sitting on the fence. Then, six more storks come to join them, making it 7 + 6 = 13 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 3 + 4 = 7 birds and 13 storks.;
Response:  The total number of birds initially was 6 + 3 = 9. Now, two additional storks have come to join them, making it 9 (birds) + 2 = 11. So, there are 11 birds and 5 storks (including the initial 3) sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 8 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.;
Response:  There are 4 birds initially sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more storks come to join them, making it a total of 10 storks (including the initial 3) now sitting on the fence. So, there are 4 birds and 10 storks in total sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 6 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  The initial number of birds was 6. Then, 4 more birds joined them, making it 10 in total (6 + 4). Next, 8 more storks arrived, bringing the total number of birds and storks to 18 (10 + 8). Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  The total number of birds initially was 2. Then, additional 5 birds joined them, making it 7 in total (including the initial 2). Next, another 4 storks arrived, bringing the total count to 11 (birds + storks). So, there are 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.;
Response:  The total number of birds initially was 3 + 2 = 5. Then, additional 6 storks joined them, making it 5 + 6 = 11. So, there are 11 storks more than birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 storks and 3 birds. So, in total, there were 8 creatures (storks + birds) who sat on the fence. Now, when 4 more birds arrived, we have a total of 12 creatures (storks + birds + new birds). Therefore, there are now 4 more birds than storks sitting on the fence. The correct answer is 4.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence. So, in total, there were 8 creatures (storks + birds) sitting on the fence. Now, when 3 more birds arrived, we have a total of 8 + 3 = 11 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence (6 storks - 2 birds = 5).;
Response:  The initial number of birds was 3, plus 6 more storks = 9 (storks). Plus, there were already 2 more birds joining the group = 11 total (birds + storks) sitting on the fence. So, there are 9 storks more than birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  The first chapter is 48 pages long and the second chapter is 11 pages long. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the length of the second chapter from the length of the first chapter. So, the difference between the two lengths is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter.;
Response:  The length of the first chapter is 37 pages, and the length of the second chapter is 80 pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter.;
Response:  The first chapter contains 60 pages, and the entire book consists of 93 pages. To determine how many pages are in the second chapter, we can use the following formula: Number of pages in Chapter 2 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 1. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of pages in Chapter 2 = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.;
Response:  We know that the second chapter is 36 pages long and the total number of pages in the book is 67. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.;
"Response:  The total number of pages in the book = Total length of all three chapters. So we can write an equation as follows: Chapter 1 + Chapter 2 + Chapter 3 = Book Length. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Chapter 1 = 66 pages; Chapter 2 = 35 pages; Chapter 3 = 24 pages. Substituting these values into our equation gives us: 66 + 35 + 24 = x Where ""x"" represents the total number of pages in the book. Solving for ""x,"" we get: x = 125 pages. Therefore, the book has 125 pages altogether.";
Response:  The length of the first chapter is 91 pages, while that of the second chapter is 23 pages. To find out how many additional pages are in the first chapter compared to the second chapter, we must subtract their lengths from each other. Therefore, the difference between the two chapters' page counts equals:  91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.;
Response:  The length of the first chapter is 35 pages, so it makes up half of the total number of pages in the book (since there are three chapters). Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 70 (half of 140). Now, we know that the second chapter is 18 pages longer than the third chapter. So if the third chapter has x pages, then the second chapter has x + 18 pages. Substituting this into our equation for the total number of pages gives us: Total = 70 + (x + 18) = 140. Solving for x, we get x = 62. So the second chapter has 62 more pages than the third chapter.;
Response:  The length of the first chapter is 53 pages, the second chapter is 75 pages, and the third chapter is 21 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the length of the third chapter from the length of the first chapter: 53 - 21 = 32 pages. So, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.;
Response:  The number of chapters in the book is given as 31. Each chapter has 61 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages in all chapters = Number of chapters x Total number of pages per chapter. So, we can write this equation: 31 x 61 = ____________. Now, solve for the blank space using the multiplication operation. 31 x 61 = 1901 pages. Therefore, the book has 1901 pages altogether.;
Response:  The total number of pages in the book = 2 x 23 = 46 pages. Since the first chapter is 10 pages long, we can say that the number of pages in the first chapter = 10/2 = 5 pages. So, there are 5 pages in the first chapter.;
Response:  The first chapter of the book contains 20 pages (2 x 10 = 20). Now, let's calculate the number of pages in the second chapter based on the information provided: Number of pages in the second chapter = Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in the first chapter Total number of pages in the book = 81 + 81 = 162 Number of pages in the first chapter = 20 Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter = 162 - 20 = 142 pages. So, there are 142 pages in the second chapter of the book.;
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon. 
We know that 62 campers went rowing in the morning and 39 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows: Total number of campers who went rowing = 62 + 39 = 101 campers. Therefore, there are 101 - 39 = 62 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.";
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon. 
We know that 52 campers went rowing in the morning and 61 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows: Total number of campers who went rowing = 52 + 61 = 113 campers. Now, to find out how many more campers went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon: More campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning = 61 - 52 = 9 more campers. Therefore, there were 9 more campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.";
"Response:  We know that 15 campers went rowing in the morning and a total of 32 campers went rowing that day. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Morning Rowers = 15
Total Rowers = 15 + Afternoon Rowers
Now, we are given that some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. This means that the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is greater than 0. Therefore, we can write:
Afternoon Rowers > 0
From the above two equations, we can conclude that there were at least 16 campers (15 from the morning plus 1 from the afternoon) who went rowing that day. However, since it was not explicitly stated that all 16 campers went rowing, we cannot say with certainty that exactly 16 campers went rowing in the afternoon.";
Response:  If 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon and a total of 60 campers went rowing that day, then we can say that 53 campers (60 - 7) did not go rowing in the afternoon. Therefore, all 53 campers must have gone rowing in the morning. So, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.;
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon + Number of campers who went rowing in the evening.
We know that 36 campers went rowing in the morning, 13 campers went rowing in the afternoon, and 49 campers went rowing in the evening. So, we can write this as follows: Total number of campers who went rowing = 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 campers. Therefore, 108 campers went rowing altogether.";
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Total number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon + Total number of campers who went rowing in the evening. 
Total Number Of Campers Who Went Rowing = 44 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) + 31(evening) = 114
Therefore, there are 114 campers who went rowing throughout the day. To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning. 
Number More In Morning Than Afternoon = 44 - 39 = 5
So, there were 5 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.";
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Total number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon + Total number of campers who went rowing in the evening. 
Total Number Of Campers Who Went Rowing = 53 (morning) + 48 (afternoon) + 49 (evening) = 150
Now we need to find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the evening. To do this, subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the evening from those who went rowing in the morning : 
Number More Campers In Morning Than Evening = 53 - 49 = 4
Therefore, there were 4 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the evening.";
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon + Number of campers who went rowing in the evening. 
So, Total no. Of campers who went rowing = 33 (morning) + 34 (afternoon) + 10 (evening) = 77 campers. 
Now, to find out the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon and those who went rowing in the evening, we subtract the latter from the former : Difference = 34 - 10 = 24 campers. Therefore, there are 24 more campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the evening.";
"Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.
= 13 + 21
= 34
Therefore, 34 campers went rowing altogether.";
"Response:  In the morning, there were 29 campers who went rowing, and in the afternoon, there were 26 campers who went rowing. To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning:

Number of campers who went rowing in the morning - Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 29 - 26 = 3

Therefore, three more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.";
Response:  In total, there were 41 campers who went rowing in the morning + 26 campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 67 campers who went rowing altogether. As for hiking, only 4 campers went hiking in both the morning and afternoon = Total number of campers who went hiking = 4. Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking is equal to 67 (rowing) + 4 (hiking) = 71 campers.;
"Response:  We know that 43 campers went rowing in the morning. So, the total number of campers who went rowing = 43 + x, where 'x' is the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon. Since we are told that ""some"" additional campers went rowing in the afternoon, it means that 'x' is not equal to zero. Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing = 43 + x = 46. So, the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is 46 - 43 = 3.";
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and the tree originally had 7 apples, then after picking the 4 apples, there would be 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree. So, there are still 3 apples on the tree.;
Response:  Rachel had 4 apples to start with, so if she picked some of them, then the number of apples left on the tree is 2. So, Rachel picked 4 - 2 = 2 apples.;
Response:  Rachel had 7 ripe apples initially, which means there were 10 (total) apples on the tree - 7 ripe + 3 unripe = 10. Now, after picking 7 ripe ones, there are 3 unripe apples left on the tree. So, the number of unripe apples on the tree is 3.;
Response:  Rachel had 2 ripe apples initially, so there were 7 - 2 = 5 unripe apples on the tree at first. Now, after she picked two more ripe apples, there are 5 + 6 (the number of new ripe apples) = 11 ripe apples left on the tree. So, the total number of ripe apples that the tree had initially was 5.;
Response:  Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree, which means that initially, the tree had 6 + 2 = 8 apples (6 ripe apples plus 2 unripe apples). So, the tree had 8 apples to begin with.;
Response:  Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree, so initially, the tree had 3 + 27 = 30 ripe apples. Therefore, the tree had 30 ripe apples to begin with.;
Response:  Rachel initially had 7 apples on the tree. Then, two new apples grew on the tree after she picked some. So, the total number of apples on the tree is now 7 + 2 = 9 apples. Finally, the statement says that the tree still has 6 apples left on it. Therefore, the initial number of apples on the tree was 9 - 6 = 3 apples.;
Response:  Rachel initially had 2 apples on her tree. She then picked 4 more apples, so the total number of apples on the tree was 2 + 4 = 6. After that, 3 new apples grew on the tree, bringing the total number to 6 + 3 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 apples on Rachel's tree now.;
Response:  Rachel had 52 apple trees and picked two apples from one of them. This means that after picking two apples, there are 50 remaining apple trees (52 - 2 = 50). Now, we know that one of these trees had seven apples left on it. So, in total, Rachel had 50 x 7 = 350 apples on all her apple trees. Therefore, the tree had 350 apples to start with.;
Response:  Rachel had three apple trees and picked 8 apples from each tree. So, in total, she picked 24 apples (3 x 8 = 24). Now, there are 9 apples left on all the trees. To find out how many apples were on the trees initially, we need to subtract the number of apples that Rachel picked from the total number of apples on the trees. Therefore, the initial number of apples on the trees was 9 + 24 = 33 apples.;
"Response:  Rachel had 4 apple trees and picked 7 apples from each tree. So, the total number of apples she picked is:

4 x 7 = 28

So, there are 29 apples left on the trees after Rachel picked some. Therefore, the total number of apples Rachel picked is 28 + 29 = 57 apples.";
"Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug initially. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had x - 2 marbles, then after Doug lost some marbles, he had x - 4 marbles (since we said he lost ""some""). Now, since Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, Ed has x + 19 = 38 marbles (since Doug has x - 4). Therefore, Doug lost 4 marbles.";
Response:  Ed has 10 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has 45 - 10 = 35 marbles. Then, Doug loses 11 marbles, leaving him with x marbles. So, Ed has 35 + 11 = 46 marbles more than Doug.;
Response:  Ed initially had 6 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 22 - 6 = 16 marbles and Doug had 22 - 7 = 15 marbles. Therefore, Doug has 15 marbles now.;
Response:  Ed has 5 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has 27 - 5 = 22 marbles. If Doug loses 3 marbles at the playground, he will have 22 - 3 = 19 marbles initially.;
"Response:  Ed initially had 24 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had x - 24 marbles, we can write an equation based on this information:
x = (D + 24)
Now, we are told that Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground. So, after losing these marbles, Doug had x - 27 marbles left. We can use this information to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug:
Ed had x marbles, and Doug had x - 27 marbles. Therefore, the difference between their number of marbles is:
x - (x - 27) = 24
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x - 27 = 24
Solving for x, we get:
x = 51
So, Ed had 51 more marbles than Doug.";
Response:  Ed initially had 29 more marbles than Doug. Then, he lost 17 marbles at the playground. So, Ed's current number of marbles is: 29 + 17 = 46. Therefore, Ed has 46 marbles more than Doug.;
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug initially. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had x - 19 marbles, then after losing some marbles at the playground, Ed would have x + 8 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, Ed lost 19 marbles.;
Response:  Ed initially had 30 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed = Doug + 30. Then, Ed lost 21 marbles at the playground. Now, Ed has 91 marbles (initially he had 91 - 21 = 70 marbles). To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now, we need to subtract the number of marbles Ed lost from the total number of marbles Ed currently has: Ed > Doug by 70 - 30 = 40 marbles. Therefore, Ed has 40 more marbles than Doug after losing 21 marbles at the playground.;
Response:  Ed initially had 12 more marbles than Doug, so Ed = Doug + 12. After losing 20 marbles at the playground, Ed has 17 marbles left. So, we can set up an equation as follows: Ed = Doug + 12 - 20 = 17 Now, to find out how many marbles Doug has, we need to subtract Ed's current number of marbles from Ed's initial value (Doug + 12). Therefore, Doug has 39 marbles (Doug = Ed - 12).;
Response:  The total number of students who gave suggestions is 408. Of these, 408 students suggested adding mashed potatoes (no of students = 408). On the other hand, only 42 students suggested adding bacon to the menu (no of students = 42). Therefore, we can say that the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes exceeds the number of students who suggested bacon by 366 (i.e., 408 - 42);
"Response:  The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 479 and the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 489. To find out how many more students suggested bacon than those suggesting mashed potatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon:

Number of students who suggested bacon - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 489 - 479 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more students who suggested bacon than those suggesting mashed potatoes.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, Sofia requested that 310 students recommend particular meals for their school cafeteria. Bacon was one of the options recommended by some pupils (185). As a result, there are 185 students who advocated including bacon in the menu.;
Response:  According to the question, 264 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu. Therefore, we can say that 264 students suggested mashed potatoes.;
"Response:  We know from the problem statement that 457 students were surveyed and they provided their suggestions for the school lunch menu. Of these, 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes compared to those who suggested adding bacon. This means that among the remaining 394 students (i.e., 457 - 63), fewer students suggested adding bacon than adding mashed potatoes. In other words, there are x number of students who suggested adding bacon, where x is less than 394. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:
x + 63 = 394
Now, let's solve for ""x,"" which represents the number of students who suggested adding bacon. To do this, subtract 63 from both sides of the equation:
x = 394 - 63
x = 331
Therefore, 331 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement, 182 students recommended including mashed potatoes in the school lunches, and 166 additional students advocated for bacon. This means there are 166 more students who want bacon than those who want mashed potatoes. So, we can say that x = 166 (the number of students who wanted bacon). 
Therefore, the total number of students who suggested bacon is 166 + 182 = 348.";
"Response: 
The total number of students participating in suggesting new food items is equal to the sum of the numbers of students who suggested each type of food item.
So, we can write an equation as follows:
Number of Students Participating = Number of Students Suggested Mashed Potatoes + Number of Students Suggested Bacon + Number of Students Suggested Tomatoes
Now let's substitute the values given in the question:
Number of Students Participating = 324 + 374 + 128
= 826
Therefore, 826 students participated in suggesting new food items.";
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is given as 257. The number of students who suggested adding bacon is given as 120. And the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes is also given as 97. To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. So, the difference between these two numbers is: 257 - 120 = 137. Therefore, there are 137 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.;
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 144. The number of students who suggested adding bacon is 467. And the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes is 79. To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. So, the difference between these two numbers is: 144 - 79 = 65. Therefore, there are 65 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes.;
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding bacon is 337, while the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes is 23. So, we can say that the difference between the number of students who suggested bacon and those who suggested tomatoes is equal to 337 - 23 = 314. Therefore, there are 314 more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes.;
"Response:  The number of students who participated in suggesting new food items is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes.
So, we can write an equation as follows:
Participants = Total Students - Number of Students who added Mashed Potatoes
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:
Participants = 450 - 45 (since 45 students suggested adding mashed potatoes)
Therefore, the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items is 405 (450 - 45).";
Response:  According to the query, 218 students recommended including mashed potatoes and bacon in their meal suggestions. This implies that 218 - 351 = 133 students did not recommend adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, 133 students proposed adding just bacon to the menu.;
"Response: 
The number of students who suggested adding Bacon = 269.
The number of students who suggested adding Mashed Potatoes = 330.
The number of students who suggested adding Tomatoes = 76.
Now we need to find out how many more students suggested Mashed Potatoes than those who suggested Bacon.
Let X be the number of students who suggested Mashed Potatoes minus the number of students who suggested Bacon.
We know that X + 269 = 330 (as 330 students suggested Mashed Potatoes).
Simplifying the equation, we get:
X = 330 - 269 = 61
Therefore, there are 61 more students who suggested Mashed Potatoes than those who suggested Bacon.";
"Response:  We know that the total number of students in the school is 569 + 236 = 805. Since we want to find out how many more girls than boys the school has, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, let's do this calculation:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 805 - 236
= 569

Therefore, the school has 569 more girls than boys.";
"Response:  We know that the number of girls is 34, and the number of boys is 841. To find out how many more boys than girls the school has, we need to subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:

841 - 34 = 807

So, the school has 807 more boys than girls.";
Response:  We know from the problem statement that there are 485 students at this school. Of those, 232 are girls, which means that the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.;
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in that school.;
Response:  If there are 635 girls in the school, then there are 635 + 510 = 1145 boys in the school. Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 868 + 587 = 1455.;
Response:  If there are 700 girls in the school, then there are 700 + 142 = 842 boys in the school. Therefore, there are 700 + 842 = 1542 pupils in the school.;
Response:  The initial number of girls is 706 + 418 = 1124. And the initial number of boys is 222. So, the total number of students in the school initially was 1124 + 222 = 1346. Now, after 418 additional girls have joined the school, the new total number of students will be 1346 + 418 = 1764. Therefore, there are currently 1764 pupils in the school.;
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 902 + 811 = 1713. If 44 more girls join the school, then the new total number of girls will be 902 + 44 = 946. So, there are 946 girls in the school after 44 additional girls have joined.;
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 632 + 410 = 1042. If 465 more girls join the school, then the new total number of girls will be 632 + 465 = 1097. Now, we need to find out how many more girls than boys the school has now. To do this, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 1097 - 410 = 687. So, the school currently has 687 more girls than boys.;
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 732 + 682 = 1414. Since 8 more boys have enrolled, the new number of boys is 761 + 8 = 769. Therefore, the number of girls in the school after additional enrollment is 1414 - 769 = 645.;
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 135 + 214 = 349. If 496 more girls join the school, then the new number of girls will be 349 + 496 = 845. Similarly, if 910 more boys join the school, then the new number of boys will be 214 + 910 = 1124. Therefore, there are currently 1124 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls in the school. So, if we add this number to the total number of students (which is given as 318), we get: Total Number of Students = 308 + 318 = 626. Therefore, there are 626 pupils in that school.;
Response:  The number of students is given as 315 for girls and 309 for boys. Therefore, the total number of students = 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are present in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of students to teachers = Number of students / Number of teachers = 624 / 772 = 0.85 or approximately 85%.;
"Response:  We know from the problem statement that there are 402 more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are x boys in the school, then there would be x + 402 girls in the school. 
We also know that the total number of students in the school is 739 (given). Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 402) = 739. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 402 = 739. Subtracting 402 from both sides gives us: 2x = 337. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 168.5. So, there are approximately 169 boys in the school.";
Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys and there are 692 girls, then the number of boys is equal to 692 - 458 = 234. So, the total number of pupils in the school is 234 + 692 = 926. Therefore, there are 926 pupils in that school.;
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 362 + 257 = 619. If 403 additional girls join the school, then the new total number of students will be 619 + 403 = 1022. Now, we need to find out how many more girls than boys there are in the school now. To do this, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 1022 - 362 = 660. So, there are 660 more girls than boys in the school now.;
Response:  Edward initially had $18 and then spent $16. So, his new balance is: $18 - $16 = $2. Therefore, Edward has $2 left after spending $16.;
Response:  Edward initially had $13 and then spent some money to have $3 left. So, we can say that Edward spent $10 ($13 - $3).;
Response:  Edward had $ 9 initially and later spent $ 8 more, so he has $ 17 now. To find out how much Edward had before spending his money, we need to subtract $ 8 from $ 17, which gives us $ 9. Therefore, Edward had $ 9 before he spent any money.;
Response:  Edward had $ 16 initially and bought 92 books at a cost of $ 16 per book. So, he spent $ 16 x 92 = $ 1452 on buying books. Now, he is left with $ 16 - $ 1452 = -$ 1436. Therefore, Edward had $ -1436 before spending any money.;
Response:  Edward spent $6 to buy two books, so he paid $6 / 2 = $3 per book. Since he had $12 left after buying the books, we can set up the equation: $3 + $3 = $12. Therefore, each book cost $3.;
Response:  Edward had $ 25 initially ( $ 6 for buying books + $ 19 for buying pens). He then spent some amount of money which is equal to $ 6 (the cost of buying books) plus $ 16 (the cost of buying pens), resulting in a total expenditure of $ 22 ($ 6 + $ 16 = $ 22). So, after spending this amount, Edward was left with $ 3 ($ 25 - $ 22 = $ 3). Therefore, Edward had $ 3 before he spent any money.;
Response:  Edward spent $4 to buy books and $3 to buy pens. So far, he has spent a total of $7 ( $4 + $3). Now, he has $12 left in his pocket. To find out how much he spent on each item, we can divide the amount he spent by the number of items he bought. For books, he spent $4 / 1 = $4 per book. For pens, he spent $3 / 1 = $3 per pen. Therefore, Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens.;
Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens, so his total spending was $16 + $8 = $24. Now, he has $19 left after buying these items, which means that he spent $19 - $24 = -$5 more on books than on pens. Therefore, Edward spent $5 more on books than on pens.;
Response:  Edward had $ 17 initially and later spent some of it. So, let x be the amount that he spent. Now, we know that after spending $x, he got $10 as a gift from his friend. Therefore, his new balance is $7 = $17 - $x + $10. To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to solve for x in this equation. We can do this by subtracting $10 from both sides of the equation: $7 = $17 - $x. Subtracting $x from both sides gives us $7 = $6. Therefore, Edward had $6 before he spent any money.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups, David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, and we want to find out how many push-ups they did together. So, if David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, then David did 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 44 push-ups, and David did 102 push-ups, so together they did 44 + 102 = 146 push-ups.;
Response:  Zachary did 51 push-ups while David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups that David did from the number of push-ups that Zachary did. So, the difference between their numbers is: 51 - 44 = 7. Therefore, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.;
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if we subtract 9 from 44, we get 35. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups in gym class today. We are also given that David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did 51 - 49 = 2 push-ups more than Zachary. Therefore, the total number of push-ups done by both David and Zachary is: x + 2 = 53 (since David did 51 push-ups).;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches. David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. However, we are also told that David did 27 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.;
Response:  Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 29 + 44 = 73 push-ups. However, David did 13 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did 17 - 13 = 45 crunches. Therefore, David did 73 push-ups and 45 crunches.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 53 + 17 = 70 push-ups. However, we are also told that David did 10 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did 14 - 10 = 4 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 53 push-ups and 4 crunches.;
Response:  Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 93 push-ups (58 + 35). However, David did 87 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 24 crunches (3 - 87). So, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches done by Zachary is: 93 - 24 = 69. Therefore, Zachary did 69 more push-ups than crunches.;
Response:  Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. However, David did 62 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches. So, Zachary did 58 crunches more than his push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups and David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, David did 58 push-ups (39 + 19). Now we are also given that John did 13 push-ups less than David. Therefore, David did 58 - 13 = 45 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. So, David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22). Now we are told that John did 4 push-ups less than David. Therefore, John did 69 push-ups (73 - 4).;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, David did 54 push-ups (39 + 15). John did 9 fewer push-ups than David, so John did 45 push-ups (54 - 9 = 45). Now we want to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. To do this, subtract the number of push-ups done by John from the number of push-ups done by Zachary: 15 (Zachary) - 45 (John) = 30. Therefore, Zachary did 30 more push-ups than John.;
Response:  We know that David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if David did 37 push-ups, then Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did x push-ups, and Zachary did 38 push-ups. So, together they did 38 + x = 104 push-ups.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, David performed 40 additional push-ups compared to Zachary (Zachary did 34 push-ups). So, David did 40 + 34 = 74 push-ups. Now, we are told that David did 17 fewer crunches than Zachary. If Zachary did 62 crunches, then David did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches. Therefore, David did 45 crunches in gym class today.;
Response:  Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, so he did 25 more push-ups than crunches (58 - 33 = 25).;
Response:  Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, so he did 12 (17 - 5) more crunches than push-ups.;

So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and those he received in the evening is:  19 - 7 = 12 more emails that Jack received in the morning than in the evening. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.;
Response:  Jack got 10 emails in the morning, so he got 5 + 10 = 15 emails in total that day. In the afternoon, he got 5 emails, and in the evening, he got 4 emails. So, the difference between the number of emails he got in the afternoon and the evening is 5 - 4 = 1 more email. Therefore, Jack received one more email in the afternoon than in the evening.;
Response:  According to the question, Jack got six emails in the morning, three in the afternoon, and additional ones in the evening. So, altogether, Jack obtained ten emails that day. Therefore, we can conclude that Jack acquired three emails in the afternoon (ten - six = three).;
Response:  Jack received 3 emails + 5 emails = 8 emails in total during the day. Additionally, he received 64 letters + 54 letters = 118 letters in total during the day. So, to summarize, Jack received 8 emails and 118 letters during the day.;
Response:  Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so altogether he received 5 + 6 = 11 items of mail in the morning. Then, in the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters, for a total of 9 + 7 = 16 items of mail in the afternoon. Therefore, in total, Jack received 11 + 16 = 27 items of mail during the day.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails + 12 letters = 22 communications. In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails + 44 letters = 47 communications. To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we subtract the number of emails received in the morning from the number of emails received in the afternoon: 47 - 22 = 25. So, Jack received 25 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. So, altogether, he received 6 + 8 = 14 communications in the morning. Then, in the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters. Therefore, he received 2 + 7 = 9 communications in the afternoon. To find out how many more letters Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we subtract the number of letters he received in the afternoon from the total number of letters he received in the morning: 14 - 7 = 7 more letters were received in the morning than in the afternoon.;
Response:  Jack got six emails in the morning and two more in the afternoon for a total of eight emails throughout the day.;
Response:  Jack got 4 emails in the morning and 6 more in the afternoon for a total of 10 emails. He also wrote 2 letters in the morning and another 8 in the afternoon, so altogether he sent 10 + 8 = 18 emails during the day. Therefore, Jack sent 18 emails in the day.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack got seven emails during the morning hours. So, the number of emails Jack got after lunch is equal to nine minus seven = two. Therefore, Jack obtained two additional emails in the afternoon.  ;
"Response:  Jack got 5 emails in the morning, so he also got x emails in the afternoon. Since we know that the total number of emails Jack received is 24 (16 + 5 + 3), we can set up the equation:
x + 5 = 24...(1)
Now, let's solve for 'x', which represents the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon:
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:
x = 19...(2)
So, Jack received 19 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.";
"Response:  According to the question, Jack got three emails in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows:

Total emails = Morning + Evening + Afternoon
= 6 + X + 3

Here, X represents the number of emails Jack received in the morning. Since we know that Jack received six emails in the morning, we can substitute this value into our equation:

Total emails = 6 + X + 3

Now, we are trying to find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon. Substituting the value of X (i.e., six emails) into our equation, we get:

Total emails = 6 + 3

Therefore, Jack received three emails in the afternoon.";
"Response:  The distance that the frog jumped is given as 12 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped beyond the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance that the grasshopper jumped from the distance that the frog jumped. So, the difference between their jumps is:

12 inches - 9 inches = 3 inches

Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.";
Response:  The total distance both of them jumped is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. So, if the grasshopper jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches, then together they jumped 31 + 35 = 66 inches.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 36 inches, which means that the frog jumped x inches more than the grasshopper. Since the mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog, the frog jumped x + 15 inches. Now we can substitute these values in the equation to solve for x: x + 15 = 17 (inches) Solving for x, we get x = 22 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 25 inches, which means that the frog jumped x inches more than the grasshopper to win the competition. Since the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, the mouse jumped x + 2 inches. Therefore, the distance the mouse jumped is 25 + (x + 2) = 47 inches.;
Response:  The mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog. So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the mouse jumped x + 20 inches. Now, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, so the total distance the mouse jumped is equal to the sum of the distances jumped by the frog and the mouse: x + (x + 20) = 19. Solving for x, we get x = 39 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 39 - 19 = 20 inches farther than the grasshopper.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, which means that the distance between the starting point of the grasshopper and its ending point is equal to 19 inches. Now, we know that the frog jumped 39 inches more than the grasshopper, so the distance covered by the frog will be 39 + 19 = 58 inches. Finally, since the mouse jumped 94 inches fewer than the frog, the distance covered by the mouse will be 58 - 94 = 36 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 58 inches.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 25 inches, which means that the distance between the starting point of the grasshopper and its ending point is equal to 25 inches. Now, we know that the frog jumped 32 inches more than the grasshopper, so the distance covered by the frog is equal to 32 + 25 = 57 inches. Finally, we are told that the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog, which implies that the distance covered by the mouse is equal to 57 - 26 = 31 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 31 inches.;
Response:  The mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so the distance the mouse jumped is equal to the distance the frog jumped minus 5 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 38 inches (33 - 5 = 38). So, the mouse jumped 7 inches farther than the grasshopper (38 - 24 = 7).;
Response:  We know that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches in one hop. So if the frog jumps 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, then the frog will jump 15 inches (13 + 2). Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 35 inches, which means it covered that distance in one jump. Then, we are told that the frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper. This means that the frog also covered a distance of 4 inches in its single jump. So, the total distance both hoppers and frogs jumped together is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. Therefore, the overall distance = 35 + 4 = 49 inches.;
Response:  We know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The statement says that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches. Similarly, we are also given that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. This means that if the frog jumped x inches, then the mouse jumped x - 44 inches. Now, we need to find out how much the frog jumped. Using the information provided in the question, we can set up the following equation: Grasshopper = Frog + Mouse ( since the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more than the frog) Frog = x - 44 Mouse = x - 44 Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: Grasshopper = x + 4 (since the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more than the frog) Frog = x - 44 Mouse = x - 44 Solving for x (the distance the frog jumped), we get: x = 23 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 23 inches.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, the grasshopper jumped 39 inches in total. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches more than the frog, so the frog jumped 39 - 19 = 20 inches. Similarly, the mouse jumped 12 inches fewer than the frog, so the mouse jumped 20 - 12 = 8 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 21 inches, which is more than what the frog (who jumped 16 inches less) jumped. So, the difference between the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - Frog's jump = 21 - 16 = 5 inches. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 5 inches farther than the mouse.;
"Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped beyond the grasshopper, we need to subtract their distances from each other. So, the difference between their jumps is:
Frog - Grasshopper = 39 - 17 = 22 inches
Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, the mouse jumped 3 inches fewer than the frog. So if the frog jumped x inches, then the mouse jumped x - 3 inches. Now we know that the grasshopper jumped 9 inches, so the total distance traveled by all three animals together is: Grasshopper + Frog + Mouse = 9 + (x - 3) + 3 = 15. Therefore, the mouse jumped 15 - 3 = 12 inches.;
Response:  The mouse jumped x inches fewer than the grasshopper. Since the grasshopper jumped 14 inches, we can say that the mouse jumped x = 14 - 16 = 2 inches fewer than the grasshopper. Therefore, the mouse jumped 2 inches fewer than the grasshopper.;
Response:  Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, which means she needs to add 9 more cups (14 - 5 = 9) of flour. To find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add, we can use the same calculation: 6 cups of sugar / 9 remaining cups of flour = 0.7 cups of sugar per cup of flour. So, Mary needs to add 0.7 x 9 = 6.3 cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6.3 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.;
Response:  Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, so she needs to add 5 more cups (9 - 4 = 5). To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups of flour from the total amount of sugar needed: 11 - 5 = 6 cups of sugar left to add. So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar.;
Response:  Mary has already added x cups of flour (since she still needs 8 more). The total amount of flour needed is 6x + 13(6 - x) = 6x + 78. Since Mary only needs 8 more cups of flour, we can set up the equation: 6x + 78 = 8. Solving for x gives us that Mary needs an additional 4 cups of flour.;
Response:  If Mary has already added 4 cups of flour (since she needs 2 more), then the total amount of flour she has added so far is 4 + 2 = 6 cups. Therefore, the remaining amount of flour needed to complete the recipe is 11 - 6 = 5 cups.;
Response:  The recipe requires 11 cups of sugar, and Mary has added 3 cups so far. To find out how many cups are left, we subtract the amount she has added from the total required: 11 - 3 = 8. Similarly, the recipe requires x cups of flour, and Mary has added 3 cups so far. We can set up an equation using this information: x - 3 = 6. Now we solve for x: x = 9. So, the recipe required 9 cups of flour.;
Response:  If Mary has already added 6 cups of flour (since the recipe requires 12) and now she needs to add another 2 cups, then she must have added a total of 6 + 2 = 8 cups of flour so far. So, the amount of flour Mary put into the mixture is 8 cups.;
Response:  Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, which means she needs to add another 6 cups (9 - 3 = 6). So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour.;
"Response:  Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar out of the required 14 cups. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:

14 - 2 = 12

So, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of sugar.";
Response:  Mary needs to add 12 - 11 = 1 cup of flour. So, she needs one additional cup of flour.;
Response:  Mary needs to make 10 - 7 = 3 additional cups of flour. Since each cup of flour requires 2 cups of sugar, Mary must add 6 (3 x 2) more cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs 6 + 2 = 8 more cups of sugar than flour.;
Response:  Mary needs to make 10 additional cups of flour (12 - 2 = 10). Since each cup of flour requires 3/4 cup of salt, Mary needs to add 7 3/4 cups of salt (10 x 3/4 = 7 3/4). Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 3/4 cups of salt after adding 2 cups of flour.;
"Response:  Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, which means she needs to add 1 cup (6 - 5 = 1) more. Now, let's find out how much sugar and salt are needed based on the original amounts called for in the recipe:
Sugar: The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar, so Mary still needs 3 cups (8 - 5 = 3) more. Salt: The recipe calls for 7 cups of salt, so Mary still needs 1 cup (7 - 5 = 1) more. Therefore, Mary needs 3 cups of sugar and 1 cup of salt more to complete the recipe.";
Response:  Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar (13 - 2 = 11). So, she needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to the recipe.;
Response:  Mary needs to add 6 - 4 = 2 cups of sugar. To find out how many cups of flour she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of flour (9) by the number of cups of sugar she has added so far (2). So, Mary needs to add 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of flour. Since you cannot have a fraction of a cup, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour.;
Response:  Mary needs to add 9 - 2 = 7 cups of flour. Since each cup of flour requires 1/4 cup of sugar, Mary needs to add 7 x 1/4 = 1 3/4 cups of sugar. So, Mary needs to add 1 3/4 cups of sugar after adding 7 cups of flour.;
Response:  Mary has already added 11 cups of flour, which means she needs to add 3 more cups (14 - 11 = 3). To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (5 cups) by the number of cups of flour she has already added (11 cups): 5 / 11 = 0.45 or 3/4 cup. So, Mary needs to add 3/4 cup of sugar more.;
Response:  If Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to her cake mixture and the recipe requires 10 cups of flour, then Mary still needs 5 + 10 = 15 cups of flour. However, the recipe also calls for 3 cups of sugar, so we know that Mary has already added 3 cups of sugar to her mixture. Therefore, the amount of flour left to add is equal to the total amount needed minus the amount of sugar already added (15 - 3 = 12). So, Mary put in 12 cups of flour into her cake mixture.;
Response:  If Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to her cake recipe, which requires 13 cups of flour total, then she must have started with zero cups of flour (since you can't add something that doesn't exist). So, the amount of flour Mary put into the mixture is zero cups.;
Response:  Mary has already added 7 cups of flour, which means she needs to add 7 + 14 = 21 more cups of flour. So, Mary needs to add 21 more cups of flour.;
Response:  Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar, which means she needs 1 cup more. Therefore, Mary needs 11 cups of sugar (not 9).;
Response:  Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour (10 - 6 = 4). So, she needs to add 4 more cups of flour.;
Response:  Mary needs to make 14 - 4 = 10 cups of flour left. Since each cup of flour requires 3/4 cup of sugar (a common ratio), Mary needs to add 10 x 3/4 = 7 1/2 cups of sugar. So, Mary needs to add 7 1/2 cups of sugar after adding 4 cups of flour.;
Response:  Mary needs to make 7 - 2 = 5 cups of flour left. The recipe requires 9 cups of sugar and 4 cups of salt. So, Mary needs to add 5 / 3 = 1 cup and 1/3 cup of flour respectively. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 + 1/3 = 1 1/3 cups of flour and 4 - 1 = 3 cups of salt.;
Response:  Mary needs to add 5 cups (11 - 6 = 5) of sugar after adding 12 cups of flour. Since she has already added 12 cups of flour, she only needs to add 3 cups (5 - 12 = 3) of salt. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of salt than cups of sugar.;
Response:  Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar (7 - 4 = 3). So, she needs to add 3 more cups of sugar.;
"Response:  Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour (since the recipe requires 14 cups of flour but she has only added 10 so far). To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can divide the remaining amount of flour by 2: 14 - 10 = 4; therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour. So, the answer is 4 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.";
"Response:  We know that 60 bird families fled during winter. The total number of bird families in the area before winter was 19 (as stated in the problem). So, we can say that the number of bird families remaining after winter = 19 - 60 = -41. 
Therefore, more bird families fled during winter than remained behind.";
Response:  We know that 7 bird families fled for winter, so we have 87 - 7 = 80 bird families remaining in the area. Therefore, more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away for winter.;
"Response:  We know that 20 bird families migrated away for winter, which means they left the mountain area. Now we need to find out how many bird families remained behind. The statement ""most animal"" suggests that only a few birds stay back during migration season. So, let's assume that 14 bird families stayed behind. Therefore, the number of bird families living near the mountain at the start was 14 + 20 = 34 bird families.";
Response:  We know that 23 bird families fled to Africa and 37 bird families fled to Asia. So, in total, 60 bird families (23 + 37) have flown away from the mountain. Therefore, the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is equal to 85 - 60 = 25.;
"Response:  We know from the problem statement that 42 bird families fled to Africa and 31 bird families fled to Asia. So, we have:

Number of bird families that fled to Africa = 42
Number of bird families that fled to Asia = 31
Now, let's find out how many more bird families fled to Africa than those that fled to Asia:

More birds fled to Africa = Number of bird families that fled to Africa - Number of bird families that fled to Asia
= 42 - 31
= 11
So, 11 more bird families fled to Africa than those that fled to Asia.";
"Response:  We know from the question that 47 bird families fled to Africa and 94 bird families fled to Asia. So, we have:

Number of bird families that fled to Africa = 47
Number of bird families that fled to Asia = 94 - 47 = 47

Therefore, the number of bird families that fled to Asia exceeds the number of bird families that fled to Africa by 47 - 47 = 0.";
"Response: 
The total number of bird families = 18 (living near the mountain) + 38 (moved to Africa) + 80 (moved to Asia) = 226
Therefore, the number of bird families that flew away for the winter is 226.";
Response:  The number of bird families that lived near the mountain before was 87. If 18 new bird families joined them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain afterward would be 87 + 18 = 105. Therefore, there are 105 bird families living near the mountain now.;
"Response: 
We know that 59 bird families fled away for winter, so their number = 59.
Now, we have 49 bird families remaining near the mountain. So, the total number of bird families near the mountain after migration = 49 + 24 = 73.
Therefore, 73 bird families were left near the mountain after the migration.";
Response:  We know that 27 bird families migrated away for the winter. So, initially, there were 41 - 27 = 14 bird families living near the mountain. Therefore, only 14 bird families remained near the mountain after migration.;
Response:  We know that out of 86 bird families, 45 lived near the mountain initially. This means that 41 additional bird families (86 - 45 = 41) migrated away for the winter. Therefore, the number of bird families that stayed back near the mountain is 45.;
"Response:  We know from the question that 35 bird families fled to Asia and 62 bird families fled to Africa. So we have:

Number of bird families that fled to Africa = 62
Number of bird families that fled to Asia = 35
Now, let's find out how many more bird families fled to Africa than those that fled to Asia:

More birds fled to Africa = Number of bird families that fled to Africa - Number of bird families that fled to Asia
= 62 - 35
= 27
So, 27 more bird families fled to Africa than those that fled to Asia.";
"Response: 
1) Winter is coming, so some birds will leave their homes in search of warmer climates.
2) There are three bird families that already reside near the mountain (the original residents).
3) Twenty-six new bird families arrived at the mountain from the Arctic region during this time.
4) Two bird families decided to fly farther south for the winter season.
5) To find out how many bird families remained nearby the mountain after all these changes, we must subtract the number of birds that departed (2) from the total number of bird families present initially plus those who recently moved in (26 + 3 = 30). Therefore, twenty bird families remain close to the mountain after everything settles down.";
Response:  Paul started with 253 crayons and lost/gave away 70 of them. So, he has 183 crayons left (253 - 70 = 183). Therefore, Paul had 183 crayons left by the end of the school year.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 628 crayons at first (the number he received as a gift). By the end of the school year, he had either lost or given away 551 of them, leaving him with 177. So, to find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we can subtract the number he gave away from the total number he initially had: 628 - 551 = 77. Therefore, Paul got 77 crayons for his birthday.;
Response:  Paul had 440 crayons initially and gave away 111 crayons to his friends. So, now he has 329 crayons remaining (440 - 111 = 329). Then, he lost 106 crayons. Therefore, he is left with 223 crayons (329 - 106 = 223).;
Response:  Paul received a box of 65 crayons as a gift and gave 213 crayons to his friends throughout the academic year. This implies that he has 65 + 213 = 278 crayons in total. If he misplaced 16 crayons, then the number of crayons left is 278 - 16 = 262 crayons. Therefore,Paul lost or gave away 16 crayons.;
Response:  Paul had 589 crayons initially and gave away 571 crayons throughout the school year. This means that he has 18 crayons left (589 - 571 = 18). He also mentioned that he misplaced 161 crayons. So, the number of crayons he gave away is greater than the number he lost by 161 - 18 = 143 crayons. Therefore, Paul gave 143 more crayons to his friends than he lost.;
Response:  Paul had 110 crayons initially and gave away 90 crayons during the school year. This means that he has 110 - 90 = 20 crayons left with him. Now, he lost 412 crayons. So, the difference between the number of crayons he lost and the number he gave away is: 412 - 90 = 322 crayons. Therefore, he lost 322 more crayons than he gave away.;
"Response:  Paul gave away 563 crayons and lost 558 crayons, so he has 332 crayons remaining. If he received new crayons for his birthday, then the total number of crayons he now has is equal to the original amount plus the new ones he received. Therefore, the number of crayons he got for his birthday is:

Total crayons = Original crayons + New crayons
= 332 + x
where x is the number of crayons he got for his birthday.
Solving for x, we have:
x = 332 - 563
x = -231
Therefore, Paul got 231 crayons for his birthday.";
Response:  Paul has 535 crayons and gives 52 crayons to his friends. So, now he has 535 - 52 = 483 crayons remaining. Later, he loses 535 crayons, which means he has 483 - 535 = -67 crayons (negative number indicates that he has fewer crayons). Therefore, the total number of crayons Paul has lost or given away is 67.;
Response:  We know that Paul received a total of 521 crayons + 66 erasers = 587 items in the beginning. If he did not lose any erasers, then the number of erasers he has now is 66. So, the number of crayons he has now is 587 - 66 = 521. Therefore, Paul lost 521 - 154 = 367 crayons during the school year.;
"Response:  We know that Paul received a total of 531 crayons and 38 erasers as gifts. At the end of the school year, he was left with 391 crayons but still had all 38 erasers. To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we can subtract the number of crayons he had at the beginning from the number he had at the end:

Number of crayons left = Number of crayons at end - Number of crayons at start
= 391 - 531
= -140
Therefore, Paul had 140 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.";
"Response:  We know that Paul received a total of 601 crayons and 406 erasers as gifts. At the end of the school year, he was left with 336 items (crayons + erasers). To find out how many more erasers than crayons he had left, we need to subtract the number of crayons from the total number of items he had at the beginning of the year:

Total items = 601 crayons + 406 erasers = 1007

Number of items left = 336

Difference between crayons and erasers = Total items - Number of items left
= 1007 - 336
= 671

Therefore, Paul had 671 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year.";
"Response:  We know that Paul has 291 crayons at the end of the school year and he initially received x crayons in his birthday gift. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
x + 291 = 315... (1) 
Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many crayons Paul got in his birthday gift: 
Subtracting 291 from both sides gives us: 
x = 34... (2) 
Therefore, Paul got 34 crayons in his birthday gift.";
Response:  Paul had 267 crayons initially and lost 231 crayons, so he has 36 (267 - 231) left. He then gave away 308 crayons to his friends, which means he now has 36 + 308 = 344 crayons remaining. Therefore, he gave away more crayons than he lost by 344 - 308 = 36 crayons. So, he gave away 36 more crayons than he lost.;
Response:  We know that Paul received $457$ erasers and $320$ crayons as gifts. At the end of the school year, he was left with $523$ erasers and crayons combined. This means that he had $\boxed{523 - 457 = 66}$ more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year. Therefore, Paul had $\boxed{66}{more}$ crayons than erasers left.;
"Response:  The waiter initially served 11 customers. After some of them left, there were 3 remaining customers. To find out how many more customers left than remained, we need to subtract the number of remaining customers from the initial number of customers. So, the difference between the two numbers is:

11 - 3 = 8

Therefore, 8 more customers left than remained.";
"Response:  The waiter initially had 3 customers. After some of them left, he still had 4 customers. So, the number of customers who left is equal to the number of customers he still has (4). Therefore, the difference between the number of customers who remained and those who left is also equal to 4.
So, the number of more customers who stayed behind than those who left is 4.";
Response:  The waiter initially served 9 customers. After they left, he still had 12 customers remaining. So, if we subtract the number of customers who left (9) from the total number of customers he had at first (12), we get the initial number of customers as follows: Initially, the waiter had 3 customers (12 - 9 = 3).;
Response:  The waiter initially had 14 customers. If 5 of them left, then the number of customers he has now is 14 - 5 = 9. So, the waiter currently has 9 customers.;
Response:  The waiter initially served 13 customers and then gained 4 more customers. So, in total, he has 13 + 4 = 17 customers now. If he still has 9 customers, that means 8 customers (i.e., 17 - 9) have left. Therefore, 8 customers left.;
Response:  The waiter initially served 12 customers and lost 15 of them. So, at this point, he has no more than 12 - 15 = -3 customers. Then, he gained 14 new customers, so now he has +14 = 11 customers. Therefore, the number of customers the waiter currently serves is 11.;
"Response:  The waiter initially had 3 customers, and then additional customers arrived to make it 8 in total. So, we need to find out how many new customers arrived. We can do this by subtracting the initial number of customers from the final number of customers:

New customers = Final customers - Initial customers
= 8 - 3
= 5

Therefore, 5 new customers arrived.";
Response:  The waiter initially had 8 customers and lost some of them, leaving him with 5 customers remaining. Then, he gained 99 new customers, bringing the total number of customers to 104 (8 + 5 + 99). To find out how many customers left, we need to subtract the initial number of customers from the total number of customers after gaining new ones: 104 - 8 = 96. Therefore, 96 customers left.;
Response:  The waiter initially had 12 customers and lost 2 of them (leaving him with 10). Then, 10 new customers arrived, bringing his total number to 20. Therefore, the waiter currently has 20 customers.;
Response:  Dan had $3 - $2 = $1 initial amount of money. So, he had $1 initially.;
Response:  Dan had $4 initially and spent some of it to buy a candy bar. After buying the candy bar, he was left with $3. So, the cost of the candy bar is equal to the amount Dan had left ($3) minus the initial amount he had ($4). Therefore, the cost of the candy bar = $3 - $4 = $-1.;
Response:  Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 per candy bar, so he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297 on buying candy bars. Now, he has $4 - $297 = $-293 left. Therefore, there is negative $293 left with him after buying 99 candy bars.;
Response:  Dan had $3 to spend and bought two candy bars that cost $4 each. So, in total, he spent $4 + $4 = $8. Therefore, each candy bar costs half of the total amount spent, which is $8 / 2 = $4 per bar.;
Response:  Dan had $2 to spend and paid $6 per candy bar. So, if he bought x candy bars, then his total spending would be: Total Spending = Number of Candy Bars x Cost Per Candy Bar Total Spending = x x $6 = $x Now we are given that Dan spent all of his money ($2), so we can set up an equation: $x = $2 This means that Dan bought exactly two candy bars with his $2. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  Dan had $7 initially. He spent $2 on buying a candy bar, so now he has $7 - $2 = $5 remaining. Then, he spent another $3 on buying a chocolate, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2 in total. Therefore, there are $2 of dollars left after purchasing both items.;
Response:  Dan spent $7 on the candy bar and $6 on the chocolate. So far, he has spent a total of $7 + $6 = $13. Therefore, Dan spent $13 to buy the candy bar and chocolate.;
Response:  Dan spent $6 on the candy bar and $3 on the chocolate. So far, we know that Dan has spent a total of $9 ($6 + $3). To find out how much more he spent on the candy bar than on the chocolate, we can subtract the amount he spent on the chocolate from the total amount he spent: $9 - $3 = $6. Therefore, Dan spent $6 more on the candy bar than on the chocolate.;
Response:  Dan spent $2 on a candy bar and $3 on a chocolate. To find out how much more he spent on the chocolate than on the candy bar, we can subtract the cost of the candy bar from the total amount he spent: $$ Total = Cost of candy bar + Cost of chocolate $$ Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $$ Total = $2 + $3 $$ Simplifying, we get: $$ Total = $5 $$ So, Dan spent $5 to buy both the candy bar and the chocolate together. Therefore, he spent $3 more to buy the chocolate than he did to buy the candy bar.;
Response:  Dan had $4 and spent it all on a candy bar that cost $8. So now he has nothing. Then his friend gave him $5 more. Therefore, there are $5 + $4 = $9 remaining in total.;
Response:  Dan started with $4 and spent all of it except for $3. So, the candy bar cost $4 - $3 = $1.;
Response:  Dan had $4 initially and spent it all on buying 10 candy bars that cost the same amount of money. So, he spent a total of $4 x 10 = $40 on the candy bars. Now, he has $4 - $40 = $-36 left. Therefore, there is $36 left after buying the candy bars.;
Response:  Dan had $3 initially and spent it all to buy two candy bars that cost the same amount of money. So, if he spent all his initial money, then the cost of each candy bar is equal to the initial amount he had. Therefore, the cost of each candy bar = $3.;
Response:  Dan spent $3 on chocolate and $7 on candy bars, so in total, he spent $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent more money buying the candy bar ($7) than he did buying the chocolate ($3).;
Response:  Dan spent $7 on the chocolate and $2 on the candy bar. So far, we know that Dan has spent a total of $9 ($7 + $2). To find out how much more he spent on the chocolate than on the candy bar, we can subtract the amount he spent on the candy bar from the total amount he spent: $9 - $2 = $7. Therefore, Dan spent $7 more on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar.;
Response:  Paul has 115 books initially. He sells 78 of them at a garage sale. So, now he has 115 - 78 = 37 books remaining with him. Therefore, Paul has 37 books left with him after the garage sale.;
"Response:  We know that Paul sold 137 books during the garage sale and was left with 105 books. So, if we subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had, we get:

Total Number of Books = Initial Number of Books - Number of Books Sold
= 105 - 137
= -32

So, Paul initially had 32 books.";
Response:  Paul initially had 108 books. After selling some books at a garage sale, he has 62 books remaining. So, we can deduce that he sold 46 books (108 - 62 = 46).;
"Response:  We know that Paul initially had 50 books and then bought some at a garage sale to get 151 books in total. So we can write an equation as follows: 50 + x = 151 where ""x"" represents the number of books Paul bought at the garage sale. Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 50: x = 151 / 50 = 3 So, Paul bought 3 books at the garage sale.";
"Response:  Paul initially had two books and then sold some of them at a garage sale to get $360. After that, he purchased 150 new books. So, his current number of books is:

New Books = Initial Number of Books - Money Earned from Garage Sale
= 2 - $360
= 58

Therefore, Paul sold 72 books (2 - 58) during the garage sale.";
Response:  Paul initially had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale to get $$. After that, he purchased 42 new books. So, his current number of books is less than or equal to 21 + 42 = 63 books. Therefore, he sold fewer books than he bought. The difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought is zero (0).;
Response:  Paul initially had 71 books and then sold some of them at a garage sale to get $$. After that, he purchased 38 new books, so his current total is 116 books. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he currently has: $$ Number \text{ of }books \text{ he } bought = 116 - 71 = 45$$ So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.;
"Response:  Paul started with 108 books and 55 pens. If he sold some of them at a garage sale, then he has fewer items now. We know that he has 66 books and 59 pens remaining. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he has now from the initial amount. So, the number of books he sold is:

108 - 66 = 42

Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale.";
"Response:  Paul started with 51 books and 106 pens. If he sold some of them at a garage sale, then he has 82 books and 14 pens remaining. To find out how many pens he sold, we can subtract the number of pens he still has from the initial number of pens he had:

106 - 14 = 92

So, Paul sold 92 pens at the garage sale.";
Response:  If Paul started with 136 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he has fewer books than he started with. So, let x be the number of books that Paul sold. Since he is left with 27 books after selling some, we can write an equation as follows: 136 - x = 27. Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or mental math to find out that x = 109. Therefore, Paul sold 109 books at his garage sale.;
Response:  Paul initially had 134 books. After giving 39 books to his friend, he was left with 95 books (134 - 39 = 95). Then, he sold some of these books at a garage sale, leaving him with 68 books (95 - x = 68), where 'x' is the number of books he sold at the garage sale. So, we can set up an equation as follows: 95 - x = 68. Solving for 'x', we get: x = 27. Therefore, Paul sold 27 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 95 pens and 153 books. After the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left = 153 - 13 = 140 books were sold at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 42 pens and 143 books. After the garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 pens remaining. To find out how many pens were sold during the garage sale, we can subtract the number of pens he still has from the initial number of pens he had: 42 - 19 = 23. So, Paul sold 23 pens at the garage sale.;
Response:  The initial number of roses in the vase was 10. Then Jessica added 8 more roses to the vase, so the total number of roses in the vase is 10 + 8 = 18 roses. Therefore, there are 18 roses in the vase now.;
"Response:  We know that Jessica cut 16 additional roses from her flower garden and added them to the vase with the original 16 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses in the vase is:

16 + 16 = 32

So, there were 32 roses in the vase at the beginning.";
Response:  There were initially 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses, leaving us with 2 - 4 = 2 roses remaining in the vase. Then, she cut additional roses from her flower garden to add to the vase, resulting in a total of 2 + x = 23 roses in the vase (where x is the number of roses she cut). So, we can set up an equation as follows: 2 + x = 23. Solving for x, we get: x = 21. Therefore, Jessica cut 21 roses from her flower garden to add to the vase.;
Response:  Jessica had 15 roses in the vase initially. She threw away 33 roses, which means she has thrown away half of the initial number (15). Now, she added 17 new roses to the vase, which is less than half of the remaining amount (15 - 33 = 12). Therefore, she cut fewer roses than she threw away. The difference between the number of roses she cut and the number she threw away is 12 - 33 = -21. So, she cut -21 roses than the ones she threw away.;
Response:  Jessica had 21 roses in the vase initially. She threw away 34 roses, so she has thrown away 34 - 21 = 13 more roses than she cut from her garden. Therefore, she cut 13 + 21 = 34 new roses from her garden.;
Response:  The initial number of roses in the vase was 7 + 20 = 27 roses. So Jessica cut 27 - 7 = 20 roses from her flower garden.;
Response:  Jessica initially had 13 roses in the vase and then she added more roses from her garden that had a total of 12 roses. So, the total number of roses she has is 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Therefore, there are 25 roses left in the garden.;
Response:  The total number of roses initially was 15. Then Jessica added more roses to make it 17. So, she cut 2 roses (17 - 15 = 2).;
Response:  The total number of flowers (roses + orchids) initially was 12 + 2 = 14. Then Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, resulting in 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to subtract the original number of orchids (2) from the new total number of orchids (21): 21 - 2 = 19. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids from her flower garden.;
Response:  The initial number of roses was 5, and the initial number of orchids was 3. When Jessica added more roses to the vase, their total increased to 12. However, she did not add any new orchids. So, the current number of orchids remains at 3. Therefore, there are 9 more roses (12 - 3 = 9) than orchids in the vase now.;
Response:  The initial number of roses was 7, and Jessica added 5 more roses to make it 11. Similarly, she added 8 more orchids (20 - 12 = 8) to make it 20 orchids. So, there are currently 11 more orchids than roses in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 11.;
Response:  If Jessica had 3 roses in the vase initially and then added more roses, we can assume that she cut X number of roses from her flower garden. So, the total number of roses in the vase after cutting is 3 + X = 19. Therefore, X = 16 (since 19 - 3 = 16).;
Response:  The total number of roses initially was 13. Then Jessica added 84 orchids to the vase, so the new total is 13 + 84 = 97. Later, she cut some more roses and added them to the vase, making the total number of roses 97 - 14 = 83. Therefore, Jessica cut 14 roses.;
Response:  The total number of flowers (roses + orchids) initially was 16 + 3 = 19. Then Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, resulting in 7 additional orchids and 13 additional roses. So, the final number of orchids is 7, and the final number of roses is 13. Therefore, Jessica cut 4 orchids (initially there were 3, plus 1 more).;
Response:  The initial number of roses was 6, and the initial number of orchids was 20. When Jessica added more roses to the vase, there were 22 new roses. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the total number of roses. So, the difference between the number of roses (22) and the number of orchids (20) is equal to 2 more roses than orchids in the vase now. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  The initial number of roses was 9, and Jessica added 3 more roses to make it 12. Now, she cut some more roses from her garden, which made the total number of roses 3. So, the difference between the number of roses and orchids is 10 (orchids) - 3 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 more orchids than roses in the vase now.;
Response:  Robin had 17 inches of hair before cutting it. After cutting some inches off, her new length is 13 inches. To find out how many inches she cut off, we can subtract the original length from the new length: 13 - 17 = -4 inches. So, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.;
Response:  Robin had 20 inches of hair before cutting it. After cutting, her hair is now 10 inches long. So, to find out how many inches of hair Robin had before cutting, we can subtract the length of her new hair from the total amount of hair she had initially: 20 - 10 = 10 inches. Therefore, Robin had 10 inches of hair before cutting it.;
Response:  Robin had 16 inches of hair before cutting. After cutting off 11 inches, she had 5 inches (16 - 11 = 5) of hair left. Then, her hair grew by 12 inches, so now she has 17 inches (5 + 12 = 17) of hair. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 17 inches long.;
Response:  Robin's initial length of hair is 19 inches. If she grows an additional 18 inches, then her new total length would be 19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Robin's hair is currently 37 inches long.;
Response:  Robin had 14 inches of hair at first. She then chopped it off to be 13 inches shorter than that. So, in total, she has 14 - 13 = 1 inch of hair left. Therefore, Robin currently has 1 inch of hair.;
Response:  Robin's hair was initially 14 inches long, which means that after growing by 8 inches, its length became 22 inches (14 + 8). Now, if she cut off 20 inches of her hair, her remaining hair would be 2 inches long (22 - 20 = 2). Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 2 inches long.;
Response:  Danny had 12 bottle caps before going to the park and found 53 more there. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny has is 12 + 53 = 65. Therefore, Danny has 65 bottle caps in his collection now.;
Response:  Danny had 21 bottle caps before going to the park. If he found some more bottle caps at the park, then he has 53 - 21 = 32 additional bottle caps. So, Danny found 32 bottle caps at the park.;
Response:  Danny had 51 old bottle caps that he threw away, so he started with those plus any new ones he collected later. He found 63 more bottle caps at the park and added them to his collection. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny had after finding 63 new ones is: 51 + 63 = 114. Therefore, Danny had 114 bottle caps at first.;
Response:  Danny had 35 old bottle caps that he threw away and then found 36 new bottle caps at the park. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny collected is 36 + 35 = 71. Now, Danny already had 22 bottle caps in his collection before going to the park, so the difference between the number of bottle caps he found and the number he already had is 71 - 22 = 49. Therefore, Danny found 49 more bottle caps at the park than the ones he threw away.;
Response:  Danny had 63 old bottle caps that he threw away and then found 30 new bottle caps at the park. So, the total number of bottle caps he collected is 30 + 63 = 93. Now, we are asked to find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park. To do this, subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he threw away: 93 - 30 = 63. Therefore, Danny threw away 63 more bottle caps than those he found at the park.;
Response:  Danny collected 22 bottle caps initially. Then, he found additional 28 bottle caps at the park. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny had after finding more is: 22 + 28 = 50. Therefore, Danny had 50 bottle caps at first.;
Response:  Danny had 30 wrappers initially. After finding more wrappers at the park, he gained 57 new wrappers. So, the total number of wrappers Danny had after finding them is: 30 + 57 = 87 wrappers. Therefore, Danny had 30 wrappers at first.;
Response:  Danny had 30 bottle caps initially, which means he collected 23 additional bottle caps (7 - 30 = 23). Similarly, he collected 52 wrappers (14 + 86 = 52) after finding 14 wrappers initially. Therefore, the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers that Danny found at the park is: 23 - 52 = -30. So, Danny found fewer bottle caps than wrappers at the park.;
Response:  Danny had 11 bottle caps before going to the park. He found 28 wrappers there, so he gained 28 wrappers. Now, he has 68 bottle caps + 28 wrappers = 96 items in total (bottle caps + wrappers). So, he found 30% more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.;
Response:  Danny had 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers initially. Then, he collected additional 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny has is 71 + 28 = 99. The total number of wrappers Danny has is 24 + 16 = 40. Therefore, Danny has 99 more bottle caps than wrappers.;
Response:  Danny had 10 bottle caps before finding any new ones at the park. He then found 62 wrappers at the park, which means he gained 62 - 10 = 52 wrappers. So, after adding these new wrappers to his existing collection of bottle caps, Danny now has 27 + 52 = 79 wrappers. Therefore, Danny has 79 more wrappers than bottle caps.;
Response:  Danny had 66 bottle caps initially and then lost some of them at the park. He now has 25 bottle caps left in his collection. So, to find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he lost (66 - 25 = 41). Therefore, Danny had 41 bottle caps at first.;
Response:  If Danny already had 25 bottle caps before going to the park and found additional 32 bottle caps there, then we can calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny now has as follows: Total = Existing + Newly Found = 25 + 32 = 57 Bottle Caps So, Danny found 32 bottle caps at the park.;
Response:  Danny had 60 old bottle caps that he threw away and then found 58 new ones. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 60 + 58 = 118 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny had 118 bottle caps at first.;
"Response:  Danny had 6 bottle caps before throwing away 6 of them at the park. So, he had 6 - 6 = 0 bottle caps left to throw away. Then, he found 50 new bottle caps at the park. Therefore, the total number of bottle caps Danny collected is 0 + 50 = 50. 
So, Danny found 50 more bottle caps at the park than the ones he threw away.";
Response:  Danny had 54 old bottle caps before throwing them away and then found 48 new bottle caps at the park. So, after throwing away the old ones, Danny had 52 - 54 = -2 bottle caps less than he initially had. Therefore, the number of more bottle caps that Danny threw away is equal to the difference between the total number of bottle caps he had before throwing any away and the total number of bottle caps he had after throwing some away, which is -2. ;
Response:  Danny had 42 bottle caps initially since he lost 29 bottle caps and gained 61 wrappers. So, initially, Danny had 42 bottle caps.;
Response:  Danny had 66 wrappers initially since he collected 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Then, he added another 16 bottle caps to his collection, which means he lost some number of wrappers equal to the new number of bottle caps (16) divided by the initial number of wrappers (66). Therefore, Danny had 66 - (16/66) = 66 - 0.25 = 64 wrappers at first. So, the correct answer is 64.;
Response:  Danny had 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps initially. Then, he collected 21 additional bottle caps and 52 additional wrappers. So, the total number of bottle caps he found is 50 + 21 = 71. The total number of wrappers he found is 46 + 52 = 98. Therefore, Danny found 98 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.;
Response:  Danny had 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps initially. Then, he collected additional 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers. So, the total number of wrappers he got is 65 + 31 = 96. The difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps is 96 - 5 = 91. Therefore, Danny found 91 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.;
Response:  Danny had 58 bottle caps initially, plus 25 wrappers. So, altogether, he had 58 + 25 = 83 items. Now, he has 12 additional bottle caps, which means he gained 12 - 11 = 1 more bottle cap. Therefore, Danny has one more bottle cap than wrapper.;
Response:  Danny had 18 wrappers before going to the park and found 15 additional wrappers there. So, after going to the park, Danny had 18 + 15 = 33 wrappers. Now, let's find out how many bottle caps Danny collected at the park. He found 15 bottle caps initially and already had 35 bottle caps in his collection, so the total number of bottle caps he got from the park is 35 + 15 = 50 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny has 33 wrappers more than the number of bottle caps he collected at the park. Hence, Danny has 33 more wrappers than bottle caps.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 17 peaches and he has 11 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 11
Now, let's substitute the value of Jake's peaches (17) into the equation:
17 = Steven's peaches - 11
Subtracting 11 from both sides gives us:
6 = Steven's peaches
Therefore, Steven has 6 peaches.";
Response:  Jake has x number of peaches. Since Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill, Steven has 14 + x = 28 peaches. Now, we know that Steven has 15 peaches in total, so we can set up an equation: 15 - 14 = x. Solving for x gives us x = 1. So, Jake has 1 peach.;
"Response:  Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 18 peches. Since Steven has 19 peaches, we can set up an equation as follows:
Jill + Steven = Total number of peaches
x + (x - 18) = 19
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 19
X = 9
So, Jill has 9 peaches.";
"Response:  Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 3 peaches. Jill has y peaches, and since Steven has 5 peaches, we can say that Jill has y - 5 peaches. Now, according to the problem statement, Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so the difference between their number of peaches is equal to 8. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 3 = (y - 5) + 8...(1)
Now, solve for 'y', the number of peaches that Jill has.
y = 20...(2)
Now, substitute the value of 'y' in equation (1),
x - 3 = (20 - 5) + 8
x = 15
So, Jake has 15 peaches more than Jill.";
"Response:  Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 12 peches. Since Steven has 4 peaches, we can set up an equation as follows:
x = 4 + (x - 12)
Now, we are told that Jill has more peaches than Jake. So, we can substitute Jake's value of x - 12 into this equation to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake:
Jill has more peaches than Jake, so let's subtract Jake's value from both sides of the equation:
Substituting x - 12 for Jake:
4 + (x - 12) > Jill has more peaches than Jake
Simplifying and solving for x:
x > 8
Therefore, Jill has at least 8 more peaches than Jake.";
"Response:  Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 7 peaches. Additionally, Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, who has y peaches. So, we can write an equation based on these two statements:
x - 7 = y + 9... (1)
Now, we are given that Steven has 16 peaches. Using this information in Equation (1), we get:
x - 7 = y + 9 → x = 23... (2)
Therefore, Jake has 23 peaches.";
"Response:  Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 7 peaches. Additionally, Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill, which means that if Jill has y peaches, then Jake has y + 8 peaches. Finally, we know that Steven has 17 peaches, so we can set up the equation:

Jake = x - 7 (since he has 7 fewer peaches than Steven)
Jill = y + 8 (since he has 8 more peaches than Jill)
Steven = 17 (given)
Now we need to solve for Jill's number of peaches. We can substitute Jake's equation into Jill's equation:

y + 8 = x - 7
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

y = x - 5
Now we divide both sides by y to find out what Jill has:

x - 5 = y
Solving for x, we get:

x = 12
So Jill has 12 peaches.";
Response:  Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so Steven has 9 + 9 = 18 more peaches than Jake. Jill has 16 peaches, so Steven has 18 - 16 = 2 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Steven has 2 more peaches than Jill.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement: Jake has six fewer peaches than Steven; Steven has 18 more peches than Jill; and Jill has five peaches. So we can write an equation as follows:
Jake = Steven - 6
Steven = Jill + 18
Now let's substitute the value of Jill from the third line into the second equation:
Steven = Jill + 18
Substituting Jill's value (5) in place of ""Jill"":
Steven = 5 + 18
Solving for Jake's number of peaches using the first equation:
Jake = Steven - 6
= 5 + 18 - 6
= 9
Therefore, Jake has nine peaches.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement: Jake has five fewer peaches than Steven; Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill; and Jill has 87 peaches. So we can write an equation based on these statements as follows:
Jake = Steven - 5
Steven = Jill + 18
Now let's solve for Jake's number of peaches relative to Jill's:
Jake = Steven - 5
= (Jill + 18) - 5
= Jill + 13
So Jake has 13 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 90 peaches (since Jill has 87).";
"Response:  According to the problem statement: Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven; Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill; and Jill has 12 peaches. So we can write an equation based on these statements as follows:
Jake - 16 = Steven + 15
Steven = Jake - 16 + 15
Jill = Steven - 15
Jill = (Jake - 16) - 15
Jill = 9
So, Jill has 9 more peaches than Jake.";
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 12 peaches. Also, we know that Jake has 79 more apples than Steven, so if Steven has x apples, then Jake has x + 79 apples. Now, we are told that Steven has 19 peaches and 14 apples in total. So, we can set up two equations based on this information: Equation 1: x - 12 = 19 (Jake's peaches) Equation 2: x + 79 = 14 (Steven's apples) To solve for Jake's peach count, we can substitute equation 1 into equation 2: x = 31 (Jake's peaches) Therefore, Jake has 31 peches.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, which means he has x - 13 peaches where x is the number of peaches Steven has. Similarly, we know that Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, which means he has y + 3 apples where y is the number of apples Steven has. Now, we are told that Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. So, if Jake has x - 13 peaches, then he must have y + 3 apples. Therefore, Jake has 9 + 3 = 12 apples.;
"Response:  Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has x - 6 = 9 peaches. And Jake has 8 more apples than Steven, so Jake has x + 8 = 20 apples. Now we can find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has by subtracting the number of apples from the number of peaches:
x - 9 = 17 (peaches)
So, Steven has 8 more peaches than apples.";
Response:  Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has x - 3 = 9 peaches. Steven has 12 peaches, so Steven's total number of fruits is 12 + 15 = 27. Since Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 27 - 3 = 24 peaches. Therefore, Steven has 24 - 9 = 15 more apples than peaches.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Steven has 12 peaches.
Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven. So Jake has x = 12 - 4 = 8 peaches.
Jill has 67 more peaches than Jake. So Jill has x + 67 = 8 + 67 = 75 peches.
Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Steven has 18 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. So Jake has x = 18 - 12 = 6 peaches.
Jill has 8 more peaches than Jake. So Jill has x + 8 = 6 + 8 = 14 peaches.
Therefore, Jill has 14 peaches.";
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 19 - 12 = 8 peaches less than Steven. Additionally, Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, who has x peaches. So, Jake has 8 + x = 37 peaches in total. Therefore, Jake has 37 peaches.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has x - 6 = 14 peaches (where x is the number of peaches Steven has). Also, we are told that Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill, so Jake has x + 3 = Jill's total number of peaches. Now, we can set up an equation using these two statements:
x - 6 = 14... (1)
x + 3 = Jill's total number of peaches... (2)
Now, solve for Jill's total number of peaches by adding equations (1) and (2):
Jill's total number of peaches = x - 6 + x + 3 = 17
So, Jill has 17 peaches.";
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 84 + 52 = 136 apples. Since Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 13 - 10 = 3 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 3 peaches.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, so Jake has x + 13 = 12 (apples). Since Jake also has 17 fewer peaches than Steven, we can write: x - 17 = 8 (peaches). Now we solve for x: x = 25. So Jake has 25 apples and 8 peaches.;
Response:  Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has x peaches, Jake has x - 8 peaches. Also, Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so if Steven has x apples, Jake has x + 10 apples. Now we are given that Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x - 8) = 11 + 18. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 29. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 14. Therefore, Steven has 14 more peaches than apples.;
Response:  Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has x peaches. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 + 15 = 34 apples. Therefore, Steven has 34 - 3 = 31 more apples than peaches.;
Response:  Olivia had $78 in her wallet initially. Then, she spent $15 at a supermarket. So, now she has $78 - $15 = $63 left in her wallet.;
Response:  We know that Olivia had $X to spend at the supermarket. She spent $78 there and now has $X - $78 = $33 left. To find out how much money Olivia had initially, we can set up an equation using this information: X - $78 = $33 Now, let's solve for X: X = $33 + $78 = $111 So, Olivia had $111 initially.;
"Response: 
Olivia had $100 in her wallet initially. Then, she withdrew $148 from an ATM, so now she has $248 ($100 + $148).
After visiting the supermarket, Olivia spent $159, leaving her with $73 ($248 - $159). Therefore, the amount Olivia spent is $159.";
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her wallet initially.
She collected $49 from the ATM. So now, Olivia has $49 + $3 = $52.
Later, she went to the supermarket and spent $49.
So, now Olivia has $52 - $49 = $3 remaining.
Therefore, Olivia collected $49 more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.";
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her wallet initially and then collected $91 from an ATM. So, now she has $144 ($53 + $91).
After visiting the supermarket, $14 was spent, leaving $128 ($144 - $14) with Olivia.
Therefore, the amount of money that Olivia spent at the supermarket is $14 ($128 - $144).";
Response:  The total amount of money Olivia had was $106. After visiting the supermarket, she spent $49, leaving her with $57 ($106 - $49). Then, she went to the showroom where she spent another $26, bringing her total spending to $73 ($57 + $26). Therefore, she spent $49 at the showroom.;
Response:  We know that Olivia had $54 in her wallet to start with and spent some money at the supermarket. After visiting the supermarket, there were $29 left in her wallet. So, we can calculate how much Olivia spent as follows: Total amount = Initial balance - Remaining balance = $54 - $29 = $25. Therefore, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket.;
Response:  If Olivia had $128 in her wallet initially and spent $38 at the supermarket, then she has $128 - $38 = $90 left. So, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet.;
Response:  Dave initially had 19 apps on his phone. He then deleted 5 of them. So, the number of apps remaining on his phone is equal to 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 apps left on Dave's phone after deleting 5 apps.;
Response:  Dave initially had x apps on his phone. After deleting 18 apps, he was left with 5 apps. So, we can write an equation as follows: x - 18 = 5. Now, solving for x, we get: x = 23. Therefore, Dave had 23 apps on his phone at the start.;
Response:  Dave initially had 10 apps on his phone and then added 11 more apps, so he now has 21 apps in total (10 + 11 = 21). To find out how many apps he deleted, we need to subtract the number of apps he had after deleting some from the initial number of apps he had. So, if he had 4 apps left after deleting some, that means he deleted 17 apps (21 - 4 = 17). Therefore, he deleted 17 apps.;
Response:  Dave initially had 21 apps on his phone and then added 89 new apps, so the total number of apps now is 21 + 89 = 109. Then, he deleted some apps, leaving him with 24 apps remaining. So, the difference between the number of apps he added (89) and the number he deleted (however many he deleted) is equal to 89 - x, where x is the number of apps he deleted. Therefore, the answer is 89 - x.;
Response:  Dave initially had 15 apps on his phone and then added 71 new ones. This means that the total number of apps on his phone is now 86 (15 + 71). To find out how many more apps he deleted than he added, we need to subtract the number of apps he had after deleting some from the total number of apps he added. So, if he had 14 apps left after deleting some, the difference between the two numbers is 71 - 14 = 57. Therefore, Dave deleted 57 more apps than he added.;
Response:  Dave initially had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 apps and 23 files. To determine how many apps Dave deleted, we can divide the number of apps he started with (16) by the number of apps he had remaining after deletion (5). So, Dave deleted 11 apps.;
Response:  Dave initially had 17 apps and 21 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 3 apps and 7 files. To find out how many files Dave deleted, we need to subtract the number of files he still has from the initial total number of files. So, the answer is: Number of files deleted = Initial number of files - Remaining number of files = 21 - 7 = 14 files.;
Response:  Dave initially had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files. To find out how many more apps than files he has left on the phone, we need to subtract the number of files from the number of apps. So, the difference between 21 apps and 4 files is 17 - 4 = 13 more apps than files. Therefore, Dave has 13 more apps than files left on his phone.;
"Response:  Dave initially had 19 applications and 18 documents on his phone. After removing some programs and data, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. To determine how many additional files he has over applications, we must subtract the number of applications from the total number of files: 

Files = Total Files - Applications
= 15 - 6
= 9
Therefore, Dave now has nine more files than applications on his phone.";
"Response:  Dave initially had 17 apps on his phone and then added some more to have 18 apps in total. So, the number of apps that Dave added is equal to the difference between the initial number of apps (17) and the final number of apps (18). Therefore, the answer is:

Number of apps added = 18 - 17 = 1
Dave added one app to his phone.";
Response:  Dave initially had 15 applications and 59 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 programs and 30 files. To determine how many apps Dave deleted, we can divide the number of apps he started with (15) by the number of apps he ended up with (12). So, Dave deleted 3 apps.;
Response:  Dave initially had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. To determine how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he still has from the initial total number of files he had: 21 (files remaining) - 24 = 3 (files deleted). Therefore, Dave deleted three files from his phone.;
"Response:  Dave initially had 24 applications and 9 documents on his phone. After removing some programs and data, he was left with 5 documents and 12 applications. To determine how many more applications than files he has remaining on the phone, we must subtract the number of files from the total number of applications. Therefore, the response is:
More Applications = Total Applications - Total Files = 12 - 5 = 7
So, Dave now has 7 more applications than files on his phone.";
Response:  Dave initially had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. To determine how many more files than apps he has remaining on the phone, we must subtract the number of applications from the total number of files. Therefore, the difference between the number of files (24) and the number of applications (2) is equal to the number of additional files that Dave has on his phone. So, the response is 22.;
Response:  Nell has 242 baseball cards in total. She gives 136 cards to Jeff, which means she has 242 - 136 = 106 cards left. So, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 301 baseball cards at first. She then gave 301 cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards Nell has left is 154 - 301 = -147. Since we cannot have negative numbers of baseball cards, Nell must have had 301 initial cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell initially had 528 baseball cards. Then, we are told that Jeff had only 11 cards. So, the total number of cards owned by both Nell and Jeff together is: 528 + 11 = 539 cards. Now, we are informed that Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff. This means that the number of cards Nell has left after giving some to Jeff is: 528 - x, where x is the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff. Since Nell has 252 cards left, we can set up the equation: 528 - x = 252. Solving for x, we get: x = 276. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards.;
"Response:  Nell initially had 566 baseball cards, and then she gave some of them to Jeff. After giving some away, Nell was left with 535 cards. So, if Jeff received some of Nell's cards, he must currently possess 234 + x = 535, where ""x"" represents the number of cards that Jeff got from Nell. Therefore, Jeff possesses 301 additional cards (234 + x) after receiving some of Nell's cards.";
"Response:  Nell initially collected 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs. She then gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of baseball cards to 415. The remaining ten-card packs are also reduced to 149 from 356. So, the difference between the number of baseball cards and ten-card packs is:

Number of Baseball Cards - Number of Ten Card Packs = 415 - 149 = 266
Therefore, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than ten card packs.";
Response:  Nell initially had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card collections. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of baseball cards to 404. However, since she also received ten-card collections from him, her new total for ten-cards is 495. To find out how many more ten-cards than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of ten-cards: 495 - 404 = 91. So, Nell has 91 more ten-cards than baseball cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell collected 573 baseball cards initially. She gave 195 cards to John, leaving her with 378 cards (573 - 195 = 378). Then, she gave some more cards to Jeff, which means she has fewer cards than before. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between the total number of cards she had after giving cards to John and the current number of cards she has (i.e., 378 - 210 = 168). Therefore, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff.;
Response:  Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card collections. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of cards. Now, she has 55 ten-card collections and 178 baseball cards remaining. To find out how many more baseball cards than ten cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of ten-card collections from the total number of baseball cards. So, the difference between 178 baseball cards and 55 ten-card collections is 123 baseball cards (178 - 55 = 123). Therefore, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than ten cards.;
Response:  Nell initially had 239 baseball cards and 38 10-card packs, for a total of 277 cards (239 + 38). She then gave some of her cards to Jeff, who received 111 baseball cards from her. This means that Nell is left with 166 cards after giving them away (277 - 111 = 166). Since we know that 10-card packs contain 38 cards each, Nell currently has 38 x 3 = 114 ten-card packs. So, the difference between the number of ten-card packs and baseball cards is: 114 - 111 = 3. Therefore, Nell has three more ten-card packs than baseball cards.;
Response:  If Paco started with x cookies and ate 19 of them, then he has 35 - 19 = 16 cookies left. So, initially, Paco had 16 cookies.;
Response:  We know that Paco initially had 28 cookies. Then we are told that he ate some of them and was left with 7 cookies. To find out how many cookies Paco ate, we can use the following equation: Number of cookies eaten = Initial number of cookies - Remaining number of cookies After eating. Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of cookies eaten = 28 - 7 = 21 Cookies Therefore, Paco ate 21 cookies.;
Response:  Paco initially had 40 cookies and ate 2 of them, so now he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Then, he bought 37 more cookies, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco has 75 cookies left.;
Response:  Paco initially had 25 cookies and ate 5 of them, leaving him with 20 cookies. Then, he bought 3 more cookies, bringing his total to 23 cookies (20 + 3). So, the difference between the number of cookies he ate and the number of cookies he bought is 3 (23 - 20 = 3). Therefore, Paco ate 3 more cookies than he bought.;
Response:  Paco initially had 13 cookies and ate 2 of them, so he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Then, he buys 36 more cookies. So, in total, Paco now has 11 + 36 = 47 cookies. Therefore, he bought 47 - 11 = 36 more cookies than the ones he ate.;
Response:  Paco initially had 40 cookies. He ate 5 cookies, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Then, he gave 13 cookies to his friend, leaving him with 35 - 13 = 22 cookies. Therefore, Paco has 22 cookies left.;
Response:  Paco initially had 17 cookies. He ate 14 cookies, leaving him with 17 - 14 = 3 remaining cookies. Then, he gave 13 of these cookies to his friend. So, the number of cookies that Paco ate more than he gave away is 3 - 13 = -10. Therefore, Paco ate -10 cookies more than he gave to his friend.;
Response:  Paco initially had 12 cookies. He ate 16 cookies, so now he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies (negative because we are subtracting from the initial amount). Then, he gave 21 cookies to his friend. So, the number of cookies he gave to his friend is 21 + (-4) = 17 cookies. Therefore, he gave 17 more cookies to his friend than he ate.;
Response:  Paco initially had 22 sweet cookies + 75 salty cookies = 97 total cookies. Then, after eating some of them, he ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salty cookies. So, now he has 22 - 15 = 7 sweet cookies remaining, and 75 - 54 = 21 salty cookies remaining. Therefore, Paco has 7 sweet cookies left.;
Response:  Paco initially had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies, for a total of 15 cookies. Then, he ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies, leaving him with 9 + 6 = 15 cookies remaining. So, Paco has 15 salty cookies left.;
Response:  We know that Paco initially had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies for a total of 48 cookies. After eating some cookies, we know that Paco has 5 fewer sweet cookies (he ate 5) and 2 fewer salty cookies (he ate 2). So now, Paco has 32 sweet cookies and 9 salty cookies, which is still a total of 41 cookies. To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies Paco ate, we need to subtract the number of salty cookies from the number of sweet cookies: 32 - 9 = 23. Therefore, Paco ate 23 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.;
Response:  Paco initially had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies for a total of 14 (8 + 6). Then, he ate 20 sweet cookies, leaving him with 20 - 8 = 12 sweet cookies. He also ate 34 salty cookies, so now he has 34 + 6 = 40 salty cookies. To find out how many more salty cookies he ate than sweet cookies, we subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he ate: 40 - 20 = 20. Therefore, Paco ate 20 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.;
Response:  If Paco had 37 cookies initially and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 cookie remaining. So, Paco has 1 cookie left.;
Response:  Paco initially had 36 cookies. He gave 14 cookies to his friend, so now he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Then, he ate 10 cookies, leaving him with 22 - 10 = 12 cookies. Therefore, Paco has 12 cookies left.;
Response:  Paco initially had 41 cookies. He gave 9 cookies to his friend, so now he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then, he ate 18 cookies, leaving him with 32 - 18 = 14 cookies. Therefore, he ate more cookies than he gave away (18 - 9 = 9).;
Response:  Paco initially had 6 cookies. He gave 30 cookies to his friend, so now he has 6 - 30 = -24 cookies left (he ate all of them). Then, he ate 23 cookies, which means he has -24 + 23 = 9 cookies left. So, he gave his friend 30 - 9 = 21 more cookies than he ate.;
Response:  Paco initially had 97 salty cookies and 34 sweet cookies for a total of 131 cookies. Then, after eating some cookies, he had 56 salty cookies remaining and 8 sweet cookies (since he ate 15 sweet cookies). Therefore, Paco has 56 + 8 = 64 sweet cookies left.;
Response:  Paco initially had 26 salty cookies + 17 sweet cookies = 43 cookies in total. Then, he ate 14 sweet cookies, leaving him with 43 - 14 = 29 sweet cookies. Next, he ate 9 salty cookies, leaving him with 29 - 9 = 20 salty cookies. Therefore, Paco has 20 salty cookies left.;
Response:  We know that Paco initially had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies for a total of 45 cookies. Then, after eating some cookies, we know that he has 32 sweet cookies left and 23 salty cookies remaining. To find out how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies he ate, we can subtract the number of salty cookies from the number of sweet cookies: 32 - 23 = 9. So, Paco ate 9 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.;
Response:  Paco initially had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies for a total of 65 cookies. He then ate 28 salty cookies, leaving him with 37 salty cookies (65 - 28 = 37). To find out how many more salty cookies he ate than sweet cookies, we subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the remaining salty cookies: 37 - 15 = 22. So, Paco ate 22 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.;
Response:  Gwen had $7 to start with, which means that after spending some money, she was left with $5. So, the amount of money she spent is equal to $7 - $5 = $2.;
Response:  Gwen got $X$ dollars for her birthday. She spent $8$ of it, so now she has $X - 8$ dollars left. We know that $X - 8 = 6$, so we can solve for $X$. Therefore, Gwen received $X = 14$ dollars for her birthday.;
Response:  Gwen initially had $2 from her mother and then got an additional $4 from her father, so she now has a total of $6 ($2 + $4). If she spent $3, she will be left with $6 - $3 = $3. So, Gwen still has $3 after spending $3.;
Response:  Gwen got $8 from her mom and then her dad gave her an additional $5. So far, Gwen has $8 + $5 = $13. If she spent $4, that means she had $13 - $4 = $9 left after spending. Therefore, Gwen received more money from her mom than from her dad. The difference is $9 - $5 = $4.;
Response:  Gwen got $3 from her mom and then spent $4. So far, she has $3 + $4 = $7. Now, her dad gave her $6 more dollars, so she received a total of $7 + $6 = $13. Therefore, Gwen received $13 - $7 = $6 more dollars from her dad than she did from her mom.;
Response:  Gwen got $5 from her father and then spent $4 of it. So, she has $5 - $4 = $1 left from him. Now, her mother gave her $7 more dollars. Therefore, Gwen now has $1 + $7 = $8 more dollars from her mother than she had from her father.;
Response:  Gwen got $5 from her father and an additional $2 from her mother, so in total, she has $7 ($5 + $2). If she spent $6, then she still has $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, Gwen received $1 more from her father than she did from her mother.;
Response:  Josh initially had 9 marbles and then lost some of them. If he currently has 4 marbles, that means he lost x marbles. To find out exactly how many marbles he lost, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem: Number of marbles Josh initially had = 9 Marbles Josh currently has = 4 - x So, we can write an equation as follows: 9 = 4 - x Now, let's solve for x (the number of marbles Josh lost): Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us: 5 = x Therefore, Josh lost 5 marbles.;
Response:  Josh initially had x marbles in his collection. Since he lost 21 marbles, we can write an equation as follows: x - 21 = 12 Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations. Answer: So, Josh initially had 33 marbles in his collection (x = 33).;
Response:  Josh initially had 19 marbles, which means he lost 11 of them. So, he has 8 marbles left (19 - 11 = 8). Then, he found 5 new marbles, so he now has 13 marbles (8 + 5 = 13) in total. Therefore, Josh has 13 marbles in his collection now.;
Response:  Josh initially had 4 marbles, which means he lost x marbles. Since he found 8 new marbles, that means he lost fewer marbles than he found. So, we can set up an equation as follows: 4 - x = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 12. Therefore, Josh lost 12 marbles more than he found.;
Response:  Josh initially had 7 marbles, then he lost 8 marbles, leaving him with -8 = 7 marbles. Then, he found 10 new marbles, so the final number of marbles he has is 7 + 10 = 17 marbles. Therefore, he found 10 - 8 = 2 more marbles than those he lost.;
Response:  Josh initially had 21 marbles and then found 7 more marbles. So, his new total number of marbles is 21 + 7 = 28 marbles.;
Response:  Josh initially has 20 marbles and then gives 2 marbles to Jack. So, after giving marbles to Jack, Josh has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left. Therefore, Josh has 18 marbles now.;

Response:  Josh initially had 19 marbles and then lost 11 of them. So, after losing those 11 marbles, he has 8 marbles left (19 - 11 = 8). Therefore, Josh currently has 8 marbles in his collection.;
Response:  Josh initially had 22 marbles and then found 13 more marbles. So, his total number of marbles is now 22 + 13 = 35 marbles. However, he also lost 5 marbles, so he has 35 - 5 = 30 marbles left in his collection. Therefore, Josh has 30 marbles in his collection now.;
Response:  Josh had 15 marbles initially and then found 9 additional marbles. So, his new total is 15 + 9 = 24 marbles. Now, he lost 23 marbles, which means he has 24 - 23 = 1 more marble left with him. Therefore, he lost one more marble than the number of marbles he found.;
Response:  Josh initially had 3 marbles and then found 6 additional marbles. So, the total number of marbles he now has is 3 + 6 = 9 marbles. However, he also lost 5 marbles, so the difference between the number of marbles he found and the number he lost is 9 - 5 = 4 marbles. Therefore, Josh found 4 more marbles than he lost.;
"Response:  Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, and he and his father picked them together. So, his father's strawberries must have weighed x pounds. Since Marco's strawberries are 19 pounds greater than his father's, we can write an equation as follows: 
x + 19 = 4... (1) Now solve for ""x"" using substitution or elimination method to find out how many pounds of strawberries his father had. 
Solution: To solve this problem, let's use the substitution method. Substituting the value given in the question into Equation (1), we get: 
x + 19 = 4.......................(2) Now, subtracting x from both sides gives us: 
19 = 3..........................(3) Therefore, his father had 3 pounds of strawberries.";
Response:  Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds, and his father's strawberries weighed 35 pounds. To find out how much more his father's strawberries weighed than Marco's, subtract Marco's weight from his father's weight: 35 - 13 = 22 pounds. So, his father's strawberries weighed 22 pounds more than Marco's.;
Response:  Marco and his father picked 20 pounds of strawberries in total. His father had 17 pounds of strawberries. So, if Marco has x pounds of strawberries, then he must have less than 20 pounds because his father already took out 17 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weigh 3 pounds (x = 3).;
Response:  Marco's strawberries weighed 8 pounds, and his father's strawberries weighed 32 pounds. So altogether they picked 40 pounds of strawberries (Marco's + his father's).;
Response:  Marco and his father picked 24 pounds (or 10 kg) of strawberries together. On their return journey, Marco misplaced 9 pounds (or 4 kg) of strawberries. So, Marco currently has 3 pounds (or 1.4 kg) of strawberries left. Since it was just Marco and his father who gathered the berries, his father must have had an equal amount of strawberries as well. Thus, his father's strawberries still weigh 24 pounds or 10 kg.;
Response:  Marco and his father picked 36 pounds (lbs) of strawberries together. On their return journey, his father misplaced 8 lbs of strawberries. Therefore, Marco's remaining strawberries weigh 12 pounds or 12 lbs. To determine how many pounds of strawberries his father currently has, subtract Marco's weight from the total amount initially gathered: 36 - 12 = 24 pounds. So, his father's current strawberries weigh 24 pounds.;
Response:  Marco and his father picked 22 pounds of strawberries initially. Then, on their return journey, his father discovered an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. So, in total, Marco had 22 + 30 = 52 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, his father's original collection of strawberries would have been 52 - 22 = 30 pounds.;
Response:  Marco picked 15 pounds of strawberries, so his father must have picked x pounds of strawberries to make up the remaining weight (37 - 15 = 22 pounds). Therefore, his father's strawberries weighed 22 pounds.;
Response:  Marco's strawberries alone weighed 30 pounds. If together they picked 17 pounds of strawberries, then Marco's share was 30 - 17 = 13 pounds. So, Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his father's.;
"Response:  Marco picked 10 pounds of strawberries, so his father picked x pounds of strawberries. Since they collectively gathered 26 pounds of strawberries, Marco's father must have collected x + 10 pounds of strawberries. To determine how many additional pounds his father had, subtract x from 26: x + 10 = 26; therefore, his father's strawberries weigh 16 pounds more than Marco's (x = 8).";
Response:  We know that Marco's father's strawberries weighed 11 pounds. So, altogether, they picked 30 pounds of strawberries (Marco + his dad). To find out how much Marcos strawberries weigh, we can divide the total weight by two since he is half as heavy as his dad. Therefore, Marcos strawberries weigh 15 pounds (30/2 = 15).;
Response:  The initial number of children was 2 (the two who were already on the bus). When they reached the bus stop, some more children got on the bus, bringing the total to 10. So, the difference between the original number and the new number is 8 (10 - 2). Therefore, there are 8 more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop.;
Response:  The initial number of children was 26. Then, 38 additional children boarded the bus at the bus stop, bringing the total to 64 (26 + 38). Therefore, there are currently 64 children on the bus.;
Response:  The number of children who rode on the bus before reaching the bus stop is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Number of children riding on the bus before reaching the bus stop = Total number of children - Number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of children riding on the bus before reaching the bus stop = 41 - 2 = 39. So, there were 39 children riding on the bus before reaching the bus stop.;
Response:  We know that initially, 43 children were riding on the bus. Then, some of them got off the bus at the bus stop. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children left on the bus minus the initial number of children (43 - 43). Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is 0.;
Response:  The number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the total number of children and the number of children remaining on the bus after they got off. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Children = Number of Children Remaining on Bus + Number of Children Who Got Off. Now let's substitute values from the problem statement into this equation: Total Number of Children = 41 (initial) - 18 (after getting off) = 23 (more children on the bus). Therefore, there are 23 more children on the bus before reaching the bus stop compared to the current number of children on the bus.;
Response:  We know that initially, 21 children were on the bus. Then, 10 of them got off the bus, leaving 11 children on it. Finally, some more children got on the bus, bringing the total number to 16. So, the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop is 5 (11 - 10 = 5).;
Response:  We know that initially, 5 children were on the bus. Then, 63 children got off the bus, leaving 98 (5 + 63) children on the bus. Finally, some more children got on the bus, bringing the total number of children to 14. So, the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 14 - 63 = -50. Therefore, 50 more children got on the bus than those who got off.;
Response:  We know that initially, 36 children were riding the bus. Then, 68 children got off the bus at the bus stop, leaving 36 + 68 = 104 children on the bus. Finally, some more children got on the bus, bringing the total number of children to 12 (the given answer). So, we can say that 12 - 36 = 24 more children got off the bus than those who got on it.;
Response:  We know that initially, 22 children were riding on the bus. Then, 40 more children boarded the bus while some got off. So, the total number of children on the bus after this process is: 22 + 40 = 62. Finally, we are told that there were only 2 children left on the bus overall. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is: 62 - 2 = 60.;
"Response:  We know that initially, 28 children were riding on the bus. Then, 82 children boarded the bus while some left. So, the total number of children on the bus after this process is:

Total = Initial (28) + Newly arrived (82) - Children who left (?)
= 28 + 82 - x

Here";"x' represents the number of children who got off the bus. Since we are told that there were 30 children altogether on the bus, we can set up the equation as follows:

30 = 28 + 82 - x

Now, solve for 'x':

x = 30 - 100
= -70

So, 70 children got on the bus and 30 children got off the bus. Therefore, the correct answer is 40."
Response:  We know that initially, 23 children were riding the bus and later, 24 children boarded the bus while some left. So, the total number of children who rode the bus = 23 + (24 - x), where 'x' is the number of children who got off the bus. Since 8 children were overall on the bus, we can set up an equation as follows: 23 + (24 - x) = 8... (1) Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtracting 23 from both sides gives us: (24 - x) = 6... (2) Multiplying both sides by 24 gives us: x = 120... (3) Therefore, 120 children got off the bus compared to the number of children who got on it.;
Response:  If Baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then we can say that the number of cakes left with the baker is equal to 133 - 51 = 82. So, the baker made more cakes than the ones he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes made and the number of cakes sold is 82 - 51 = 31.;
"Response:  We know that the baker initially had 54 cakes and then sold some of them. So, we can start with an initial quantity of 54 cakes. The question states that the baker still has 13 cakes left after selling some of them. This means that the number of cakes sold is equal to the difference between the total number of cakes and the remaining number of cakes. In other words, the number of cakes sold = Total - Remaining. 
So, the number of cakes sold = 54 - 13 = 41 cakes. Therefore, the baker sold 41 cakes.";
"Response:  We know that Baker made x cakes and sold 145 of them. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 145 = 72
Now, let's solve for ""x"" (the number of cakes Baker made):
x = 145 + 72
x = 217
Therefore, Baker made 217 cakes in total.";
Response:  If Baker made 155 cakes and his friend bought 140 of them, then he will still have 15 - 14 = 1 cake left.;
Response:  The baker initially had 121 cakes. He then sold 105 of those cakes, leaving him with 16 (121 - 105) cakes remaining. Finally, he purchased 170 additional cakes, so now he has 33 (16 + 170) cakes in total. Therefore, the baker currently has 33 cakes.;
"Response:  The baker made $13$ cakes initially. He then sold $91$ of these cakes, which means that he has $13 + 91 = 104$ cakes left. Finally, he buys $154$ additional cakes, so he now has $104 + 154 = 258$ cakes in total. Therefore, the number of cakes the baker bought is equal to the number of cakes he sold plus the number of cakes he already had, minus the number of cakes he used up ($= 91$). So, the answer is:

$$\text{Number of cakes the baker bought} - \text{Number of cakes the baker sold} = 258 - 91 = 167$$";
Response:  The baker made $170$ cakes initially. He sold $78$ of these cakes, which means that he has $170 - 78 = 92$ cakes left. Then, he purchased $31$ additional cakes. So, in total, the baker now has $92 + 31 = 123$ cakes. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes he sold and the number he bought is $123 - 78 = 45$.;
Response:  The baker initially had 110 cakes and sold 75 of them. So, now he has 110 - 75 = 35 remaining cakes. Then, he made another 76 cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes the baker currently has is 35 + 76 = 111 cakes.;
Response:  The baker initially made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them. This means that he has 73 remaining cakes (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made additional 111 cakes. So, in total, the baker made 73 + 111 = 184 cakes. Therefore, the number of more cakes the baker made than those he sold is 184 - 71 = 113 cakes.;
Response:  The baker initially had 149 cakes and 91 pastries. If he sold 10 cakes and 90 pastries, then he has left with (149 - 10) = 139 cakes and (91 - 90) = 1 pastries. So, the baker still has 139 cakes.;
Response:  The baker initially had 7 cakes and 148 pastries. If he sold 15 cakes, then he has 7 - 15 = 9 cakes left. Similarly, if he sold 103 pastries, then he has 148 - 103 = 45 pastries left. So, the baker still has 45 pastries.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries in total. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries, then we need to find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made. To do this, we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries made: 

Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = (48 - 81) = -33
Therefore, Baker made 33 more cakes than pastries.";
Response:  According to the information provided in the problem, Baker created 19 cakes and 131 pastries for a total of 150 items (19 + 131 = 150). If Baker sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, then we must determine how many additional pastries Baker produced compared to cakes. To do this, divide the number of pastries sold (88) by the number of pastries produced (131), which equals 0.66 or approximately 66%. This implies that Baker manufactured roughly 66% more pastries than cakes. So, Baker made 66% more pastries than cakes.;
Response:  According to the information provided in the problem, Baker created 157 cakes and 169 pastries for sale. If he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries, we must determine how many additional cakes he sold compared to pastries. To do this, divide the number of cakes sold (158) by the total amount of cakes produced (157). This gives us a ratio of 103%. Similarly, divide the number of pastries sold (147) by the total quantity of pastries manufactured (169), which results in a ratio of 87%. As a result, Baker sold 87% more cakes than pastries. ;
Response:  According to the information provided in the problem, Baker created 54 cakes and 143 pastries for a total of 197 items (cakes + pastries). If Baker sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries, then the number of additional pastries that Baker sold is equal to 92 - 68 = 24. Therefore, Baker sold 24 more pastries than cakes.  ;
Response:  If Baker sold 44 cakes and initially made 48 cakes, then we can say that after selling 44 cakes, Baker has x = 48 - 44 = 4 cakes left. So, Baker still has 4 cakes.;
Response:  If Baker sold 8 cakes and initially made 40 cakes, then we can say that the number of cakes he made is equal to the number of cakes he sold plus the initial amount of cakes he made minus the number of cakes he sold. So, in this case, the number of additional cakes the baker created would be: 40 - 8 = 32. Therefore, the baker produced 32 extra cakes beyond what he sold.  ;
Response:  The baker has 169 cakes to start with and sells 137 of them. So, after selling some cakes, the number of cakes left with the baker is equal to 169 - 137 = 32. Therefore, the baker still has 32 cakes.;
Response:  The baker had initially 173 cakes. Then, they purchased 103 new cakes, so now they have 173 + 103 = 276 cakes. Finally, they sold 86 cakes, leaving them with 276 - 86 = 190 cakes. Therefore, the baker still has 190 cakes.;
Response:  The baker made 99 cakes, which means they had 99 - 0 = 99 cakes left after making them. Then, the baker bought 167 new cakes, so they have 99 + 167 = 266 cakes now. Finally, the baker sold 89 cakes, leaving them with 266 - 89 = 177 cakes remaining. Therefore, the baker bought 167 - 89 = 78 more cakes than they sold.;
Response:  The baker has 8 cakes that he already owns (made). He buys 139 new cakes, which means he now has 139 + 8 = 147 cakes in total. Then, he sells 145 cakes. So, we need to find out how many more cakes he sold than he bought. To do this, subtract the number of cakes he bought from the number of cakes he sold: 145 - 139 = 6. Therefore, the baker sold 6 more cakes than he bought.;
Response:  The baker initially made 62 cakes and later made another 149 cakes for a total of 211 cakes (62 + 149). Then, he sold 144 of these cakes leaving him with 70 cakes (211 - 144 = 70). So, the baker would still have 70 cakes left after selling some of his initial production.;
Response:  The baker initially made 81 cakes and later made 92 more. So, in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 cakes. He also sold 46 cakes. Therefore, the number of cakes that the baker made more than those he sold is:  173 - 46 = 127 cakes.;
Response:  The baker initially had 167 cakes and 61 pastries. If he sold 108 cakes, then he has 167 - 108 = 59 cakes left. Similarly, if he sold 44 pastries, then he has 61 - 44 = 17 pastries left. Therefore, the baker still has 59 cakes and 17 pastries.;
Response:  The baker initially had 56 pastries and 124 cakes for a total of 180 items (56 + 124 = 180). If the baker sold 104 cakes, then he has 76 cakes left (180 - 104 = 76). Similarly, if he sold 29 pastries, he has 27 pastries left (76 - 29 = 27). Therefore, the baker still has 27 pastries.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes for a total of 136 items (52 + 84 = 136). If Baker sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries, then we need to find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made. To do this, we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries made: 102 - 94 = 8. So, Baker made 8 more cakes than pastries.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries, we can calculate the difference between the number of pastries he made and the number of pastries he sold as follows:

Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = 134 - 92 = 42
Therefore, Baker made 42 more pastries than cakes.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, Baker made 14 cakes and 153 pastries in total. If he sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes, then we can calculate the difference between the number of cakes and pastries that were sold as follows: Number of cakes sold = 97 - 8 = 90 Number of pastries sold = 153 - 8 = 145 Therefore, Baker sold 90 more cakes than pastries. So, the answer is 90.;
Response:  According to the information provided in the problem, Baker created 43 cakes and 114 pastries for a total of 157 items (cakes + pastries). If Baker sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes, then we must subtract the number of cakes from the overall quantity of things that were produced or sold. This gives us: Number of extra pastries = Total amount of pastries sold - Amount of pastries sold = 154 - 78 = 76 additional pastries compared to cakes. Therefore, the baker sold 76 more pastries than cakes.;
"Response:  Kelly currently has 22 Nintendo games, and she needs to have 140 games in total. To find out how many more games she needs to buy, we can subtract the number of games she already has from the total number of games she needs:

140 - 22 = 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to have 140 games in total.";
Response:  Kelly currently has 106 Nintendo games. If she gives away 64 of them, then she will be left with 106 - 64 = 42 games. So, Kelly will have 42 Nintendo games left after giving away 64 games.;
Response:  Kelly had 91 Nintendo games at first and gave them all away. So, she now has zero games. However, the problem states that she still has 92 games left, which means she must have started with more than 91 games. Therefore, Kelly initially had 92 Nintendo games.;
"Response:  Kelly has 20 Nintendo games in total. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away for her to have 12 Nintendo games left, we can subtract the number of Sony games from the total number of Nintendo games.
So, if Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games, then she needs to give away 50 (20 - 70) Nintendo games to end up with 12 Nintendo games.";
Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to give away for her to have 31 Sony games left, we can subtract the number of Sony games she already has (132) from the total number of games she owns (178). So, Kelly needs to give away 146 - 132 = 14 Sony games.;
Response:  Kelly had 80 Nintendo games initially and then found 31 additional ones. To find out how many games she needs to give away, we can subtract the number of new games from her total initial collection. So, Kelly needs to give away 59 games (80 - 31) to have 6 games left.;
Response:  We know that Randy used 52 blocks to build his tower and now there are 38 blocks left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for building the tower. In this case, the total number of blocks is 52 (the number of blocks Randy had initially), and the number of blocks used for building the tower is 52 / 2 = 26. Therefore, the number of blocks Randy had at the start is 52 - 26 = 26 blocks.;
Response:  We know that Randy had 97 blocks initially and used some of them to construct a tower. After using some blocks for the tower, Randy was left with 72 blocks. To determine how many blocks Randy utilized to create the tower, we can divide the number of blocks he had after building the tower (72) by the total number of blocks he started with (97). Therefore, Randy employed 97 - 72 = 25 blocks to construct the tower.;
Response:  Randy had 79 blocks initially. He used 14 blocks to construct a tower, leaving him with 65 blocks (79 - 14 = 65). Then, he utilized 11 blocks to create a house, resulting in 54 remaining blocks (65 - 11 = 54). Therefore, there are 54 blocks left after Randy built his tower and house.;
Response:  Randy used 27 blocks to construct the tower and 53 blocks to create the home. So, in total, Randy utilized 27 + 53 = 80 blocks to construct both structures. Therefore, Randy employed 80 blocks overall to construct the tower and the house together.;
Response:  Randy used 33 blocks to construct a tower and 13 blocks to create a home. To determine how many additional blocks were utilized in building the tower over those employed in creating the house, we must subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used for the tower: 33 - 13 = 20. Therefore, Randy used twenty more blocks to construct the tower than he did to build the house.;
"Response:  Randy used 79 blocks to construct a tower and 82 blocks to create a home. To determine how many additional blocks were utilized in building the house compared to the tower, subtract the number of blocks employed for each structure from one another:  

79 - 82 = -3 
Therefore, Randy used three fewer blocks to build his house than he did to build his tower.";
Response:  If Randy used 36 blocks to construct a tower and he has 59 additional blocks, we can determine how many blocks are remaining as follows: Total number of blocks = Number of blocks used for the tower + Number of extra blocks = 36 + 59 = 95 blocks. Therefore, there are 95 blocks remaining.;
"Response:  Randy used 20 blocks to construct a home and 50 blocks to create a tower. To determine how many additional blocks were utilized in building the tower compared to the house, we must subtract the number of blocks employed for the house from the total amount of blocks available (95). So, the difference between the number of blocks used to build the tower and those used to build the house is:  

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ blocks\ used\ to\ build\ the\ tower = 95 - 20 = 75 $$ 
There are therefore 75 more blocks that Randy used to make the tower than he did to build the house.";
"Response:  Randy used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the house than he did to build the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, the answer is:
More blocks used to build the house = 89 - 63 = 26 blocks.";
"Response:  If there are 20 books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series and I have already read 5 of them, then the number of books I haven't read is:

"Response:  If there are 11 books in the ""crazy silly school"" series and you have read 7 of them, then the number of books left to be read is 11 - 7 = 4.
Similarly, if there are 17 movies in the series and you have watched 21 of them, then the number of movies left to be watched is 17 - 21 = -6 (since negative numbers indicate that you have seen more movies than there are in the series).
So, you have read more movies than books. The difference between the number of movies you have watched and the number of books you have read is 21 - 7 = 14.";
"Response:  We know that we have already read 8 books from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. So, the number of books left to read is equal to the total number of books in the series minus the number of books we have already read.
Total Number of Books = 14 (as given in the question)

Therefore, the difference between the number of books you have read and the number of movies you have watched is equal to 1 book. So, the answer is 1.";
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the ""crazy silly school"" series and you have watched 16 of them, then you have not read any of the books. On the other hand, if there are 5 movies in the series and you have seen 19 of them, that means you have seen all 5 movies. Therefore, you have read zero books and seen 19 movies. So, the difference between the number of movies you have read and the number of books you have read is 19 - 0 = 19.";
Response:  If Dave had won 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used x number of tickets to buy toys. Since he still has 2 tickets left, we can write an equation as follows: 7 - x = 2. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic. We get x = 5. So, Dave used 5 tickets to buy toys.;
Response:  Dave won x number of tickets at the arcade. He used 12 tickets to buy some toys, so he has 14 - 12 = 2 tickets remaining. Therefore, Dave won 2x number of tickets at the arcade.;
Response:  Dave has 18 tickets in total. He uses 5 of them to buy some toys, so now he has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets remaining. Then, he uses 11 more tickets to buy some clothes, so now he has 13 - 11 = 2 tickets remaining. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.;
Response:  Dave has already won 19 tickets. He uses 12 of them to buy some toys, which means he has 19 - 12 = 7 remaining tickets left. Then, he uses 7 more tickets to buy some clothes, so now he has 0 tickets left. Therefore, Dave used 7 more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys.;
Response:  Dave has already won 13 tickets. He uses 8 of them to buy some toys, so he now has 5 (13 - 8) tickets left. Then, he uses 18 more tickets to buy some clothes, which means he has spent all his remaining tickets. Therefore, Dave used 18 more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys. The difference between these two numbers is 18. So, the answer is 18.;
Response:  Dave has 14 tickets in total that he has won at the arcade. He then loses 2 tickets, leaving him with 14 - 2 = 12 tickets. Finally, he uses 10 of these remaining tickets to buy some toys, which means he is left with 12 - 10 = 2 tickets. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left after using them to buy toys.;
Response:  We know Haley had 14 trees before the storm and 9 died during the storm. So, the number of trees left = 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, more trees died (9) than survived (5).;
Response:  The number of trees Haley had before the typhoon was 13. After the typhoon, 6 died, so the remaining number of trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, there were 7 more trees that survived the typhoon than those that died.;
Response:  We know that Haley had 20 trees in her backyard initially. After the typhoon, only 4 trees remained. So, we can say that 16 trees (i.e., 20 - 4) died during the typhoon. Therefore, the answer is 16.;
Response:  If Haley had grown 5 trees before the typhoon and 12 trees remained after the typhoon, then we can say that the total number of trees Haley grew is equal to 5 + 12 = 17 trees. Therefore, Haley grew 17 trees in her backyard.;
Response:  Haley had 9 trees initially and lost 4 of them due to the typhoon. So, she has 9 - 4 = 5 trees remaining. Then, she planted 5 more trees, so now she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in her backyard.;
Response:  Haley grew 12 trees initially. After the typhoon, two of them died. So, now Haley has 12 - 2 = 10 trees left. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left.;
"Response:  If Haley grew three trees initially and 13 trees died after the typhoon, then the number of trees that did not die is:
$ 3 - 13 = -10 $
So, ten more trees died in the typhoon than survived.";
Response:  Haley grew 11 trees initially. After the typhoon, two of them died. So, the number of trees left standing is 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, 9 more trees survived the typhoon than those that died.;
Response:  If they harvest 66 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 28 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges harvested as follows: Total Number of Oranges = Number of Sacks x Number of Oranges in Each Sack Total Number of Oranges = 66 x 28 = 1804 oranges per day Therefore, they harvest 1804 oranges per day.;
Response:  If they can harvest 8 sacks in one day,it means they need 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges ( since there are 3 times as much work to be done). So, it would take them 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.;
"Response:  We know that the harvesting process lasted for 4 days and they harvested a total of 56 sacks of oranges. So, we can calculate the number of sacks they harvested per day as follows:

Number of sacks per day = Total number of sacks / Number of days of harvest
= 56 / 4
= 14

Therefore, they harvested 14 sacks of oranges per day during the 4-day harvesting period.";
Response:  The farmer harvests 38 sacks of oranges everyday, which means in total, he will have 38 x 49 = 1762 sacks of oranges after 49 days of harvest.;
Response:  The farmer harvests 66 sacks of oranges every day, which means he collects 66 x 25 = 1650 oranges daily. To find out how many oranges the farmer will have after 87 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of oranges collected daily by the number of days of harvest: 1650 x 87 = 143,500 oranges. Therefore, the farmer will have approximately 143,500 oranges after 87 days of orange harvest.;
Response:  If they harvest 8 sacks of oranges per day, and each sack contains 35 oranges, then we can calculate the total number of oranges harvested as follows: Total Number of Oranges = Number of Sacks x Number of Oranges in Each Sack Total Number of Oranges = 8 x 35 = 280 Oranges per Day So, they harvest 280 oranges per day.;
Response:  If they harvest 16 sacks per day, and each sack contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will harvest 16 x 57 = 902 oranges. To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges harvested per day: 80 / 902 = 0.88 days. So, it will take approximately 0.88 days (or 43 hours) to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.;
Response:  If they harvest 67 sacks of oranges per day, and each sack contains 12 oranges, then the total number of oranges harvested in one day is 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. Now, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges. So, let's multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack: 35 x 12 = 420 oranges. Therefore, a total of 420 oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges.;
Response:  The farmer harvests 74 sacks of oranges every day and throws away 71 of them. This means that in one day, he has 3 sacks of oranges left over (74 - 71 = 3). To find out how many sacks of oranges the farmer will have after 51 days of harvesting, we multiply the number of sacks he gets each day by 51: 3 x 51 = 153 sacks of oranges. So, after 51 days of harvesting, the farmer will have 153 sacks of oranges.;
Response:  If they harvest 76 sacks per day and discard 64 of them, it means they collect 12 sacks of oranges per day (76 - 64 = 12). Since each sack contains 50 oranges, they harvest 50 x 12 = 600 oranges per day.;
"Response:  The farmer harvests 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges every day. This means he collects a total of 80 sacks of oranges daily (28 + 52 = 80). To find out how many sacks of oranges the farmer will have after 26 days of harvesting, we can multiply the number of sacks collected each day by 26:

80 sacks/day x 26 days = 2120 sacks of oranges collected in total
Therefore, after 26 days of harvesting, the farmer will have 2120 sacks of oranges.";
Response:  The total number of sacks of oranges harvested in one day is 82 + 61 = 143 sacks. To find out how many sacks of ripe oranges they will have after 25 days of harvest, we need to multiply the daily production of ripe oranges (82) by 25. Therefore, the total number of sacks of ripe oranges they will have after 25 days of harvest is 82 x 25 = 2050 sacks.;
Response:  The number of unripe oranges at first is 24 sacks. If they continue to harvest 24 sacks everyday for 45 days, then the total number of unripe oranges harvested in those 45 days would be: 24 x 45 = 1080 sacks. So, after 45 days of harvesting, they will have 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.;
"Response:  The total number of sacks of oranges harvested is 69 (44 + 25). To find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges were harvested than unripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges. So, the difference between the two numbers is:

$ 69 - 25 = 44 $
Therefore, $ 44 $ more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested than unripe oranges per day.";
Response:  The number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested is 5, and the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested is 74. To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges are harvested than ripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of sacks of ripe oranges from the total number of sacks of unripe oranges. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  74 - 5 = 69. Therefore, there are 69 more sacks of unripe oranges harvested than ripe oranges per day.;
"Response:  If they harvested 54 sacks of oranges in total and they harvested 18 sacks per day, we can calculate the number of days required for harvesting as follows:

Total number of sacks = 54
Number of sacks per day = 18
Days required for harvesting = Total number of sacks / Number of sacks per day
= 54 / 18
= 3
Therefore, it took 3 days to harvest all 54 sacks of oranges.";
"Response:  If they harvested 56 sacks in total, and they worked for 14 days, we can calculate the number of sacks per day as follows:

Total number of sacks = Number of days x Total number of sacks per day
= 14 days x?

So, the number of sacks per day is? = 56 / 14 = 4 sacks per day.";
Response:  The number of sacks of ripe oranges at the end of 73 days is equal to the total number of sacks of oranges harvested during those 73 days minus the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of sacks of ripe oranges = Total number of sacks of oranges - Number of sacks of unripe oranges. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of sacks of ripe oranges = (25 x 73) + (5 x 73) - Number of sacks of unripe oranges. Simplifying the equation, we get: Number of sacks of ripe oranges = 1825 - Number of sacks of unripe oranges. Since there are 50 sacks of unripe oranges harvested each day, the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested over 73 days is 50 x 73 = 3650. Substituting this value into our previous equation, we get: Number of sacks of ripe oranges = 1825 - 3650 = -1825. Therefore, after 73 days of harvest, they will have 1825 fewer sacks of ripe oranges than they started with.;
Response:  The number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in one day is 65. If they continue to harvest for six days, the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested would be 65 x 6 = 390.;
Response:  The number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested is given as 41. The number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested is given as 86. To find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested than unripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of sacks of unripe oranges from the number of sacks of ripe oranges. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  86 - 41 = 45. Therefore, 45 more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested than unripe oranges per day.;
"Response:  The total number of sacks of oranges harvested per day is given as 131 (71 + 60). To find the difference between the number of sacks of unripe and ripe oranges harvested per day, we can use the following equation:

Number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day - Number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day = Total number of sacks of oranges harvested per day x Percentage of unripe oranges in the total harvest

We know from the problem statement that the percentage of unripe oranges in the total harvest is 40%. So, we can plug this value into the above equation:

(71 x 40%) - (60 x 60%) = 131 x 40% - 120 x 60%
= 52 - 72
= -20

Therefore, there are 20 fewer sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges harvested per day.";
"Response:  We know that Jesse's room has a length of 12 feet (which we will call x) and a width of 11 feet (which we will call y). To find out how much longer the room is than its width, we need to subtract y from x. So, the difference between the length and width of Jesse's room can be calculated as follows:
x - y = 12 - 11 = 1 foot
Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.";
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 7 feet = 84 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). So, we can start with that information to find out how wide the room must be for the carpet to cover an area of 14 square feet. We know that the area of a rectangle is equal to its length multiplied by its width, so we can set up the equation: Area of carpet = Length x Width. Since we want the carpet to cover an area of 14 square feet, we can substitute this value into our equation: 14 = 84 x W. Now, we need to solve for W (the width of the room), which gives us W = 14 / 84 = 0.167 or approximately 1/6 of the length of the room. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 1/6 of 84 inches, which is 14 inches.;
"Response:  The width of Jesse's room is given as $7$ feet = $8$ inches $\times$ $2$ yards/foot = $16$ yards. Since the area of the carpet needed is $14$ square feet, we can set up the following proportion:

$$\frac{Length}{Width} = \frac{14}{7}$$

Now, we know that the length of the room is equal to $16$ yards times the ratio of the length to the width:

$$Length = 16 \times \frac{14}{7} = 35.67$$

So, the length of Jesse's room is approximately $35.67$ feet.";
Response:  The area of Jesse's room that needs to be covered with carpet is given as follows: Room length x Room width = Area needed for carpeting (in square feet) In this case, the room length is 11 feet or 11 \* 12 = 132 square feet. The room width is 15 feet or 15 \* 12 = 180 square feet. So, the total area of the room that needs to be covered with carpet is 132 + 180 = 312 square feet. Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, we need an additional 312 - 16 = 306 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor. Therefore, Jesse needs 306 square feet of extra carpet to complete the job.;
Response:  We know that Jesse's room has dimensions of length = 2 feet (or 2 x 3 = 6) and width = 12 feet (or 12 x 3 = 36). To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor area, we can use the formula Area of one tile = Length x Width = 4 square feet. Now, we have to divide the total area of the floor with the area of one tile to get the number of tiles required. Total area of the floor = Length x Width = 6 x 36 = 216 square feet One tile covers an area of 4 square feet, so Number of tiles = Total area / Area of one tile = 216 / 4 = 54 tiles Therefore, Jesse needs 54 tiles to cover the entire floor of her room.;
Response:  The length of each room is 19 feet, so we can write that as 19 x = number of rooms. Similarly, the width of each room is 18 feet, so we can write that as 18 x = total area of all rooms. To find out how much carpet Jesse needs to cover the floors of all her rooms, we divide the total area of all rooms (18x) by the length of one room (19). So, the amount of carpet needed is 18x / 19 = 180 square feet.;
"Response:  We know that Jesse's room has a length of 20 feet and a width of 19 feet. To find out how much longer the room is than its width, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, the difference between the length and width of Jesse's room is:

Length - Width = 20 - 19 = 1 foot

Therefore, Jesse's room is one foot longer than it is wide.";
Response:  We know that Jesse wants a carpet with an area of 10 square feet and we are given that her room is 5 feet long. So, we can start by finding out how wide the room is. To do this, we divide the length of the room (in feet) by 3 since there are 3 feet in a foot. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room = 5 ft / 3 = 1.67 ft.;
Response:  We know that Jesse wants a carpet with an area of 10 square feet and we are given that her room is 2 feet wide. So, the length of her room can be calculated as follows: Area of carpet = Length x Width = 10 sq ft Length = Width x Area / Width = 2 ft x 10/2 = 5 ft Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.;
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. The length of her room is 4 feet, so the width of her room is 20 feet divided by 4 = 5 feet. To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we can subtract the area of the part of the room where the carpet already covers from the total area of the room. So, the amount of additional carpet needed is: Total Area - (Already Covered Area) = 4 x 5 = 20 square feet. Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 20 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.;
"Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop earned $23 per t-shirt sold and $230 during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we can use division. So, let x be the number of t-shirts sold. Then, we have:

$23x = $230

Now, divide both sides by $23 to solve for x:

x = $230 / $23
= 10

Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 10 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.";
Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold three T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, which means it earned total revenue of $51. To find out the cost per T-shirt, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold: Cost per T-shirt = Total revenue / Number of T-shirts sold = $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt. Therefore, the cost of each T-shirt is $17.;
Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $87 per t-shirt sold. During Arkansas Game and Texas Tech Game, they sold a combined total of 95 t-shirts. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas Game, then the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech Game is 95 - 47 = 48. So, the amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech Game is $87 x 48 = $4216.;
"Response:  We know that Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $106 per t-shirt sold. The total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 242. If 115 t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game, then we can find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game as follows:

Total Number of T-Shirts Sold = Total Number of T-Shirts Sold During Arkansas Game + Total Number of T-Shirts Sold During Texas Tech Game
= 115 + X
where X represents the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.
Substituting the value given in the problem, we get:
X = 242 - 115
= 127
Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 127 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.";
Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $98 per t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and Texas Tech game, they sold a combined total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they made $872 in revenue ($98 x 89) from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game alone.;
Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $78 per t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game, they sold 172 t-shirts, so they earned $13,040 ($78 x 172). Now, we need to find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. We know that during this game, they sold a total of 186 t-shirts. So, the amount they earned from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is equal to the difference between the total number of t-shirts sold and the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game: $$ = 186 - 172 = 14$$ Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $14 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.;
Response:  The Razorback Shop made $62 per T-shirt and $99 per jersey. They sold 183 T-shirts and 31 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, let's calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price Per T-Shirt + Number of Jerseys x Price Per Jersey Total Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99 Total Revenue = $10,753 + $2,843 Total Revenue = $13,696 Therefore, the Razorback Shop made $13,696 in revenue from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.;
Response:  The Razorback Shop made $67 per T-shirt and $165 per jersey. They sold 74 T-shirts and 156 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, let's calculate their total earnings as follows: Total revenue = Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey + Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-ShirtTotal Revenue = 156 x $165 + 74 x $67Total Revenue = $120,890So, the Razorback Shop made $120,890 in revenue from selling jerseys alone during that game.;
"Response:  The Razorback Shop makes $192 for every T-shirt it sells and $34 for every jersey it sells. During the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 Jerseys. To find out how much more a T-Shirt costs than a Jersey, we need to subtract the price of a Jersey from the price of a T-Shirt. So, let's do that:
T-Shirt Price - Jersey Price = More Cost for T-Shirt
$192 (T-Shirt Price) - $34 (Jersey Price) = $158
Therefore, a T-Shirt costs $158 more than a Jersey.";
"Response:  The Razorback Shop sells $86 for each T-shirt and $232 for each Jersey. During the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, they sold 254 T-Shirts and 43 Jerseys. To find out how much more a Jersey costs than a T-Shirt, we need to subtract the price of a T-Shirt from the price of a Jersey. So, let's do that:
$232 - $86 = $146
Therefore, a Jersey costs $146 more than a T-Shirt.";
Response:  The cost price of one T-shirt is $51. During the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, there was an offer to reduce the price of each T-shirt by $8. So, the new price became $43 ($51 - $8). Now, let's find out how many T-shirts were sold during this event. According to the question, 130 T-shirts were sold. Therefore, we can calculate the total amount earned as follows: Total Amount = Number of T-Shirts x Price Per T-Shirt Total Amount = 130 x $43 Total Amount = $5290;
"Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop raised the price of each shirt by $217 during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So if we multiply this amount with the number of t-shirts sold (14), we get the total revenue generated by the sale of these t-shirts:
$217 x 14 = $2968
Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $2968 in revenue from selling those 14 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.";
"Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop earned $60 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. If they earn $10 per t-shirt sold, then we can find out how many t-shirts were sold by dividing the total amount of money earned by the profit per t-shirt. So, let's do that!
$60 / $10 = X (where X is the number of t-shirts sold)
Now, to solve for X, we need to isolate the variable X on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $10 from both sides of the equation:
X = $60 - ($10 x number of t-shirts sold)
Now, we have an equation where X represents the number of t-shirts sold:
X = $60 - ($10 x number of t-shirts sold)
We know that the Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
X = $60 - ($10 x number of t-shirts sold)
Substituting the given information:
X = $60 - ($10 x number of t-shirts sold) = $60
So, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 6 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.";
Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 5 T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, which brought in $215 in revenue. To determine how much each shirt costs, we must divide the total amount earned by the number of shirts sold: $215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $43.;
Response:  The Razorback Shop made $215 per T-shirt and $5 per Jersey. They sold 20 T-shirts and 64 Jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, the total amount of money earned by the Razorback Shop is: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price Per T-Shirt + Number of Jerseys x Price Per Jersey Total Revenue = 20 x $215 + 64 x $5 Total Revenue = $4390 ;
"Response:  The Razorback Shop made $76 per jersey and $204 per T-shirt. They sold two jerseys and 158 T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, let's calculate their revenue as follows:
Revenue from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Price Per Jersey = 2 x $76 = $152
Revenue from T-Shirts = Number of T-Shirts x Price Per T-Shirt = 158 x $204 = $31,920
Therefore, the Razorback Shop made a total of $31,920 in revenue from selling T-shirts and $152 in revenue from selling jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.";
"Response:  The Razorback Shop makes $210 for every jersey it sells and $240 for every T-shirt it sells. During the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 Jerseys. To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a Jersey, we need to subtract the revenue from selling one Jersey from the revenue of selling one T-shirt. So let's do that:
T-Shirt Revenue = $240 x Number Sold (177) = $43,800
Jersey Revenue = $210 x Number Sold (23) = $5,330
Now, let's subtract the revenue from selling one Jersey from the revenue of selling one T-shirt:
$43,800 - $5,330 = $38,470
So, based on this calculation, a T-shirt costs approximately $38,470 more than a Jersey.";
"Response:  The Razorback Shop made $115 per jersey and $25 per T-shirt. They sold 78 jerseys and 113 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. To find out how much more a jersey costs than a T-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a T-shirt from the price of a jersey. So, let's do that:

$115 (price of a jersey) - $25 (price of a T-shirt) = $90

Therefore, a jersey costs $90 more than a T-shirt.";
Response:  We know that there are five sets of tables (5). Each set contains ten chairs (10), so we can write this as 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. Therefore, they have 50 more chairs than tables. So, the answer is 50.;
Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables with an equal number of chairs. So, let's assume that one set has x chairs and the other set has y chairs. Since there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard, we can write the equation: x + y = 12. Now, we need to find out what values of x and y satisfy this equation. Can you solve it?;
Response:  We know that there are a total of 9 chairs in the backyard. If we assume that one set of tables has three chairs, then we can conclude that there must be at least 3 sets of tables in the backyard. Therefore, the number of sets of tables is equal to or greater than 3. So, the correct answer is 3 or more sets of tables.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 sets of tables, and each set contains 13 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is equal to 11 x 13 = 143 chairs. So, they have 143 chairs in their backyard.;
Response:  We know that there will be 11 people attending the party. Each table can seat 6 people, so we need 11/6 = 1.83 tables for everyone to sit comfortably (round up to 2 tables). Since they have 10 sets of tables, this means they have 10 x 2 = 20 tables in total. Therefore, after everyone sits down, there will be 20 - 11 = 9 chairs left unoccupied.;
Response:  We know that the hosts have 12 sets of tables, which means they have 12 x 14 = 168 chairs in total (including the 6 extra chairs). So, the number of chairs available for the guests is 168.;
"Response:  We know that there are four sets of tables with three chairs per set. Therefore, the total number of tables is 4 x 3 = 12 tables. Since 14 people will attend the party, we need an additional chair for every two guests beyond the initial 12 tables. So, we must purchase one extra chair. 
Therefore, the correct answer is 1.";
Response:  We know that there are 9 sets of tables and each set has 2 tables. Therefore, the total number of tables is 9 x 2 = 18 tables. Since we were told that they have 14 chairs for each set of tables, the total number of chairs they have is 14 x 9 = 126 chairs. So, they have 126 - 18 = 108 more chairs than tables.;
Response:  If Lewis earns a total of $460 in 5 weeks, that means he earned $92 per week ( $460 / 5 = $92).;
Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest season. If he earned $16 per week, we can set up an equation to represent this information: Total amount earned = Number of weeks x Weekly wage So, plugging in the values given in the problem, we get: Total amount earned = 1216 $ 16/week = X weeks Now, we need to solve for X. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $16: X weeks = 1216 / $16 = 78 weeks Therefore, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks.;
Response:  Lewis gets paid $21 per week for 216 weeks (or one year) of work. This translates to an annual income of $4,592 ($21 x 216). He must pay $702 in taxes, leaving him with $3,890 after taxes ($4,592 - $702 = $3,890).;
"Response:  If Lewis makes $1357 per week throughout the 223 weeks of the harvest period, his total income over those weeks is:
$1357 x 223 = $294,633
If he works for 73 harvest periods, his overall revenue would be:
$294,633 x 73 = $20,835,330
Therefore, Lewis will make roughly $20,835,330 if he works for 73 harvest seasons at a salary of $1357 each week.";
Response:  Lewis makes $28 each week throughout the 1091 weeks of harvest. He gets an additional $939 in overtime pay each week that he works overtime. If he works overtime every week, his total income during the harvest period is calculated as follows: Total income = Weekly salary x Number of weeks worked + Overtime pay x Number of weeks worked During the harvest season, Lewis works for 1091 weeks at $28 per week, resulting in a total income of $29,768 ($28 x 1091). Additionally, he works 52 weeks (assuming he works overtime every week) at $939 per week, bringing his overall harvest-season income to $49,638 ($939 x 52). Therefore, Lewis earns a total of $79,406 during the harvest season ($49,638 from regular work plus $29,768 from overtime).;
"Response:  Lewis makes $403 per week for 233 weeks during harvest time. To determine how much money he will make throughout the harvest period, we must multiply this amount by the number of weeks in that duration. Therefore, his total income over the course of the harvest season is:
$403 x 233 = $90,590
Therefore, Lewis earns $90,590 during the harvest season after paying $49 in rent each week.";
"Response:  Lewis makes $368 per week for 1359 weeks of harvest. To calculate how much he pays in rent each week, we multiply his income by the number of weeks he must pay rent ($388). So, the amount of rent he pays throughout the harvest period is:
$368 x 1359 = $472,072
Therefore, Lewis spends $472,072 in rent over the course of the harvest season.";
Response:  Lewis makes $491 per week for 1181 weeks. This is equal to $573,000 over the course of the harvest season (1181 x $491). If he pays $216 in rent each week, his total rent payment comes out to be $24,964 ($216 x 1181). So, after the harvest period, Lewis will have $548,040 left ($573,000 - $24,964);
Response:  The amount earned in 19 weeks is given as $133. To find out how much Lewis earns per week, we can divide this amount by 19: $$ \therefore Lewi...;
"Response:  We know that Lewis gets $ 2 per week for the harvest. So, to find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we need to divide the total amount earned ($ 178) by the amount earned per week ($ 2). Therefore, the number of weeks the harvest lasted is:
$ 178 / $ 2 = 89 weeks
Therefore, the harvest lasted for 89 weeks.";
Response:  If Dean's height is 9 feet (or 9 x 3 = 27), then the depth of the water is 10 times that value, which means it is 270 feet deep. So, the water is 270 feet deeper than Dean's height.;
Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so Ron is 14 - 8 = 6 feet tall. The water is twice as deep as Dean's height, which means it is 2 x 6 = 12 feet deep.;
Response:  We know that Ron is 12 feet tall and Dean is 11 feet shorter than him, so Dean is 12 - 11 = 1 foot tall. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height, which means it is 5 x 12 = 60 feet deep.;
Response:  We know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron and Ron stands at 13 feet tall. So, Dean stands at 17 feet (4 + 13) tall. Now we are told that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is equal to 15 x 17 = 255 feet.;
Response:  We know that Ron is 13 feet tall and Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. So, Dean is 22 feet (9 + 13) tall. Now we are told that the depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 16 x 13 = 208 feet.;
"Response:  We know that Ron is 15 feet (4.57 meters) tall, which means Dean is 6 feet (1.83 meters) shorter than him. So, Dean's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet (2.74 meters). Now we can use this value in the given statement about the depth of the water: ""the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height."" Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 feet (24.69 meters).";
Response:  If Bryan has 34 books and wants to distribute them equally among two shelves, then each shelf will have Books = 34 / 2 = 17 books. Therefore, there are 17 books in each of the two bookshelves.;
Response:  Bryan has 42 books in total. Each bookshelf holds 2 books, so there are 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves. Therefore, Bryan has 21 bookshelves.;
"Response:  Bryan has 23 bookshelves, and each shelf contains either 27 books or 80 magazines. Therefore, the total number of books is equal to the sum of all the books in each shelf:
Total Number Of Books = (Number Of Bookshelves x Total Number Of Books In Each Shelf)
= (23 x 27) + (23 x 80)
= 611 + 1840
= 2451 books
Therefore, Bryan has 2451 books in total.";
Response:  Bryan has 9 books in each of his 10 bookshelves, so he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. He also has 46 magazines in each of his 10 bookshelves, so he has a total of 46 x 10 = 460 magazines. Therefore, Bryan has a total of 90 + 460 = 550 magazines in total.;
Response:  Bryan has 23 books in each of his 29 bookshelves, so he has a total of 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, he has 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, so he has a total of 61 x 29 = 1759 magazines. Therefore, Bryan has a total of 647 + 1759 = 2406 items (books and magazines) in all his bookshelves.;
Response:  If Bryan has seven bookshelves and each shelf contains the same number of books, then the total number of books is 28 (given). To find out how many books are in each shelf, we can divide the total number of books by the number of shelves: 28 / 7 = x, where x is the number of books in each shelf. So, there are 4 books in each bookshelf (x = 4).;
"Response:  If Bryan has a total of 38 books and each bookshelf holds 2 books, then...

$ Number \text{ of } Bookshelves = Total \text{ number of Books} / Number \text{ of Books per Bookshelf}$ $= 38 / 2$ $= 19$ 
Therefore, Bryan has 19 bookshelves.";
Response:  Carol needs to send invites to 10 friends. Each package has 2 invitations, so we can calculate the number of packages needed as follows: Number of packages = Total number of invitations / Number of invitations per package = 10 (friends) x 2 (invitations/package) = 20 packages So, Carol needs 20 packages of invitations to make sure none of her 10 friends get left out.;
Response:  Carol is sending out birthday invitations to 12 friends. She buys 3 packs of invitations. So, the total number of invitations = Number of packs x Number of invitations per pack. We know that there are 12 friends and Carol has 3 packs, so we can write an equation as follows: Number of invitations = 3 x X Where X represents the number of invitations in each pack. Since Carol wants to send out invitations to 12 friends, we know that X must be equal to 4 (since there are 12 friends and 4 invitations in each pack). Therefore, the answer is: Number of invitations = 3 x 4 = 12.;
Response:  Carol purchased 7 packages of invitations with 10 invitations per package for a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. If she sent invitations to only two friends, then the number of invitations remaining would be 70 - 2 = 68 invitations.;
Response:  Carol has 6 packages of invitations with 14 invitations per package. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she buys 11 additional invitations. So, the final number of invitations is 84 + 11 = 95. Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends to her party.;
Response:  Carol has two packages with three invitations each, so that means she has total 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To invite nine friends, she needs additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3), so she needs to buy 3 more invitations. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and scored a total of 36 points, then we can write an equation as follows: Points = Number of Games x Points per Game So, substituting the values given in the question, we get: Points = 36 / 2 = 18 games Therefore, Melissa played 18 games.;
Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 81 points playing three games. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Points = Number of Games x Points per Game. Now, according to the problem statement, Melissa scored the same number of points (i.e., 20) in each game. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our previous equation: Total Points = 3 x 20 = 60. Thus, Melissa scored 60 points in each game.;
Response:  Melissa scored 109 points in each of the 79 games and received an additional 82 bonus points for each game. So her total number of points is equal to the product of the number of games played (79) and the average points per game (109). Therefore, the total number of points Melissa scored is: 79 x 109 = 8637.;
Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 21 points and we want to find out how many games she played. Since she scored 7 points in each game, we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game So, substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total score = 21 x Number of games Now, we are asked to find out the number of games Melissa played. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by the score per game (which is 7): Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.;
Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 91 points in 13 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Points = Number of Games x Average Points per Game Now, we are asked to find out how many points Melissa scored in each game. To do this, we need to divide the total number of points by the number of games played. Therefore, the average points scored by Melissa in each game is: Average Points per Game = Total Points / Number of Games ∴ Average Points per Game = 91 / 13 ∴ Average Points per Game = 7 points per game Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in each game.;
Response:  The Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has four seats. If 20 individuals may ride the wheel simultaneously, we must divide 20 by 4 to determine how many people each seat can accommodate. Therefore, each seat can hold five people (20/4 = 5).;
Response:  The Ferris wheel has seats that can hold 9 individuals apiece. If 18 persons may travel simultaneously on the wheel, we must divide 18 by 9 to determine how many chairs it contains. Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 2 seats (18 / 9 = 2).;
Response:  The number of seats available on one Ferris wheel is 19. Each seat can accommodate 15 individuals for a total of 19 x 15 = 285 riders per Ferris wheel. Since there are 20 Ferris wheels in Paradise Park, we may fit 20 x 285 = 5700 riders simultaneously. Therefore, 5700 people can ride the Ferris wheels at once.;
Response:  The Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 individuals. If ten of those seats are damaged, there will be 18 - 10 = 8 operational seats available for riders. Therefore, eight people may simultaneously enjoy the Ferris wheel.;
Response:  The Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has six seats and each seat can accommodate 14 individuals for a total of 84 passengers (6 x 14 = 84). If there are currently 16 persons on the wheel, we may add 70 additional riders to it (84 - 16 = 70). Therefore, another 70 people can board the Ferris wheel.;
Response:  The Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 2 small seats and 23 large seats. Each small seat can accommodate 14 individuals, while each big seat can accommodate 54 persons. To determine how many people may ride the Ferris wheel on little seats, we must divide the total number of seats available for small seats (2) by the maximum capacity per small seat (14). Therefore, the response is 28.;
Response:  The Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 7 big seats that can accommodate 12 passengers apiece for a total of 84 riders (7 x 12 = 84).;
Response:  If 16 individuals may ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously and it has four seats per car, then we must divide 16 by 4 to determine how many people each seat can accommodate. Therefore, each seat can hold 4 individuals or 4/4 = 1 person.;
Response:  The Ferris wheel has four seats that can accommodate two passengers each. Therefore, there are eight seats available for riders to enjoy the view from above. So, the Ferris wheel has eight seats.;
Response:  If there are a total of 14 slices and you ordered 7 pizzas, then each pizza must have 14/7 = 2 slices. Therefore, each pizza contains 2 slices.;
Response:  If there are a total of 28 slices and each pizza has 2 slices, then we can divide 28 by 2 to find out how many pizzas we ordered. So, 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas. Therefore, we ordered 14 pizzas.;
Response:  If you order 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is: 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. So, altogether, there are 25 people who will have 68 slices of pizza.;
Response:  If you order 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are only two of you, if you distribute them equally, each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices of pizza.;
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant flowers in 45 flower beds. Each flower bed contains 10 seeds, so we can calculate the total number of seeds as follows: Total Number of Seeds = Number of Flower Beds x Number of Seeds per Flower Bed Total Number of Seeds = 45 x 10 = 450 seeds Therefore, Paige and her mother planted 450 seeds altogether.;
Response:  Paige helped her mother plant 45 seeds in total. Since they planted the same number of seeds in each flowerbed, we can say that x is the number of seeds planted in each flowerbed. Therefore, the equation becomes: 45 = 9x. Now, dividing both sides by 9 gives us: x = 5. So, Paige and her mother planted 5 seeds in each flowerbed.;
"Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant flowers, and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed, so the total number of seedlings is:

36 seeds / 12 seeds per flower bed = 3 flower beds

Since only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, we can calculate the total number of flowers grown as follows:

Total number of flowers = Number of flower beds x Number of seeds that grew into flowers per flower bed
= 3 flower beds x 58 seeds/flower bed
= 174 flowers

Therefore, Paige and her mother had 3 flower beds.";
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 55 seeds altogether. Of these, she placed 15 seeds in each of the three flower beds. This means that the total number of seeds in each flower bed is 15 x 3 = 45 seeds. Now, we are told that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. So, the total number of flowers grown from all 45 seeds in each flower bed is 45 x 60/45 = 90 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers grown by Paige and her mother is 90 + 90 + 90 = 270 flowers.;
Response:  If Paige and her mom planted 60 seeds altogether, that means they planted 60 / 2 = 30 seeds per person. Since Paige was helping her mom, it means her mom planted all of the remaining 30 seeds (i.e., 30 - 10 = 20 seeds). Therefore, there were 20 flower beds.;
"Response:  Paige and her mother planted 32 seeds altogether. If they planted the same number of seeds in each flowerbed, then we can say that x is the number of seeds planted in each flowerbed. Since there are 8 flowerbeds, we can write the equation as follows: 
x × 8 = 32 
Now solve for x to find out how many seeds were planted in each flowerbed. 
So, x = 4 (seeds per flowerbed)";
Response:  If Matthew has x crackers and gives 2 crackers to each of his 11 friends, then he will give a total of 2x crackers to his friends. So, after giving crackers to his friends, Matthew will have x - 2x = -0.5 crackers left. Since negative numbers are not possible in this case, we can conclude that Matthew initially had 11 crackers (i.e., x = 11).;
Response:  If Matthew has 8 crackers and gives 2 crackers to each of his friends, then he will have given crackers to 4 friends in total. So, the answer is 4 friends.;
Response:  If Matthew has 15 crackers initially and gives an equal number of crackers to his five friends, then he will give 3 crackers to each friend (since there are 5 friends). So now, Matthew has 10 crackers left (initially he had 15 - 3 = 12 crackers), and each friend has eaten 3 crackers ( since they got 3 crackers each). Therefore, each friend ate 3 crackers.;
Response:  If Matthew has 24 crackers initially and gives an equal number of crackers to each of his three friends, then he will have given away 3 x 24 = 72 crackers in total. So, after giving away crackers, Matthews is left with 24 - 72 = -48 crackers. This means that Matthew didn't give any crackers to his friends.;
Response:  If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends, then he gave 22/11 = 19 crackers and 34/11 = 30 cakes to his friends. So each friend got 19 crackers and 30 cakes. Therefore, each person ate 19 crackers.;
Response:  If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his two friends, then he gave 14 crackers (half of 29) and 15 cakes (half of 30) to one friend, and 14 crackers and 15 cakes to the other friend. So, each friend got 15 cakes to eat.;
Response:  If Matthew has 14 crackers and 21 cakes, then he will give an equal number of crackers and cakes to his 7 friends. So, the total number of crackers given = 14 / 7 = 2 crackers per friend. Similarly, the total number of cakes given = 21 / 7 = 3 cakes per friend. Therefore, each friend will get 2 crackers and 3 cakes.;
Response:  If Matthew has 36 crackers and gives an equal number to all 18 of his friends, then he will give 2 crackers to each friend (since 18 x 2 = 36). So each friend ate 2 crackers.;
"Response:  If Matthew has 36 crackers and gives 6 crackers to each of his friends, then the number of friends he gave crackers to is:

36 / 6 = 6

So, Matthew gave crackers to 6 friends.";
Response:  Matthew initially had 23 crackers and then shared them equally among his two friends. This means that each friend got an equal number of crackers. Since Matthews had 11 crackers left after sharing with his friends, we can deduce that each friend ate half of Mathew's initial supply, which is 23 / 2 = 11 crackers per friend. Therefore, each friend ate 11 crackers.;
"Response:  We know that Matthew started with 31 crackers and then gave some to his five friends. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Matthew = initial number of crackers - number of crackers given away
In this case, the initial number of crackers is 31, so let's substitute that value into the equation:
31 = initial number of crackers - number of crackers given away
Now, we are told that Matthews gave equal numbers of crackers to each of his five friends. This means that if he gave x crackers to one friend, he gave 5x crackers to all five friends together. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows:
31 = initial number of crackers - (5x)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So, Matthew gave 6 crackers to each of his five friends.";
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his four friends, then the total number of crackers given is equal to the total number of cakes given multiplied by 4. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Number of crackers = Total number of cakes x 4  Number of cakes = 98 So, Number of crackers = 98 x 4 = 392 Now, since Matthew had 32 crackers initially, we know that 32 / 4 = X, where X is the number of crackers each friend ate. Solving for X, we get X = 80. Therefore, each friend ate 80 crackers.;
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his four friends, then the total number of crackers given is half of the initial quantity (since there are 4 friends). So, Matthew gave 5 crackers to each friend ( since there are 4 friends). Similarly, the total number of cakes given is also half of the initial quantity, which means that Matthew gave 2 cakes to each friend (again, since there are 4 friends). Therefore, each friend ate 2 cakes.;
"Response:  If Matthew provided an equal number of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, then the total number of crackers and cakes given away is equal to 28 times the initial number of crackers and cakes respectively. So, we can write:
Total Number of Crackers = 13 (initial) x 28 = 346
Total Number of Cakes = 15 (initial) x 28 = 420
Now, since each friend got an equal number of crackers and cakes, we can say that the number of crackers or cakes eaten by each friend is also equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
Number of Crackers Eaten = Number of Cakes Eaten = x
where x is the common value that satisfies both equations. Solving for x, we get:
x = 13/28 = 1/2
So, each friend ate half of the crackers and cakes they received. Therefore, the number of crackers and cakes eaten by each friend are:
Number of Crackers Eaten = 13/28 = 1/2 = 6
Number of Cakes Eaten = 15/28 = 1/4 = 3
Therefore, Matthews gave 6 crackers and 3 cakes to each of his 28 friends.";
"Response:  We know that Debby drank 109 bottles per day and the bottles lasted for 74 days. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of bottles = Total number of days / Number of bottles used per day 
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of bottles = 74 / 109 
Simplifying the fraction, we get: Number of bottles = 6 
Therefore, Debby had bought 6 bottles.";
"Response:  Debby drank the same number of bottles everyday and the bottle lasted for 17 days. So we can write an equation as follows: 
Debby drank x bottles per day 
and total bottles = 153 (bottles purchased) / 17 (days the bottles lasted) = 9
So, Debby drank 9 bottles per day.";
Response:  Debby had 264 water bottles initially and consumed 15 bottles per day for 11 days. To find out how many bottles Debby has left, we can use the following calculation: Number of bottles remaining = Initial number of bottles - Total number of bottles consumed Day 1 +... + Total number of bottles consumed Day 11 = 264 - (15 x 11) = 264 - 165 = 99 bottles Therefore, Debby has 99 bottles left.;
"Response:  Debby had 301 water bottles initially and consumed 144 bottles per day for x number of days. We know that after those days, she had 157 bottles remaining. So we can write an equation based on this information as follows: 301 = x + (x \* 144) where ""x"" represents the number of days Debby drunk water. Now we need to solve for ""x"". To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 144: 301 / 144 = x + x / 144 Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 28 days Therefore, Debby drank water for 28 days.";
Response:  Debby has 88 water bottles in total. If she drinks 4 water bottles per day, it will take her 22 days to finish them all (88 / 4 = 22).;
Response:  Debby has 256 soda bottles in total. If she drinks 4 soda bottles per day, it will take her 64 days to finish them all (256 / 4 = 64).;
"Response:  Debby drinks six bottles per day and has purchased a total of twelve bottles. To determine how long these bottles will last her, we must divide the number of bottles she has purchased by the number of bottles she consumes daily. So, let's do that calculation:

Number of bottles consumed per day = Number of bottles purchased / Total number of bottles
= 6 (bottles/day) / 12 (total bottles)
= 0.5 (days)

Therefore, the twelve water bottles Debby purchased will last her for approximately half a day or 0.5 days.";
Response:  Debby has 180 water bottles in total. If she drinks 15 water bottles per day, it will take her 180/15 = 12 days to finish them all.;
Response:  Debby has 360 soda bottles in total. If she drinks 9 soda bottles per day, it will take her 40 days to finish them all (360 / 9 = 40).;
Response:  Faye has 14 rows of pencils and 11 pencils in each row. Therefore, the total number of pencils that Faye has is equal to 14 x 11 = 154 pencils. So, Faye has 154 pencils altogether.;
Response:  Faye placed 12 pencils altogether. Since there are 3 rows, we can divide the total number of pencils by 3 to find out how many pencils were placed in each row. So, the answer is 4 pencils per row.;
Response:  Faye has 28 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 24 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is 28 x 24 = 704 pencils. Since Faye wants to place them in rows, we need to divide this amount evenly among the rows. To do so, we can divide 704 by 16 (the number of pencils in each row), which gives us 43 rows. So, Faye could make 43 rows of pencils.;

Response:  Faye has 19 rows of pencils and crayons. Each row contains 4 pencils and 27 crayons. Therefore, the total number of pencils is 19 x 4 = 76 pencils. Similarly, the total number of crayons is 19 x 27 = 503 crayons. So, Faye has 76 pencils and 503 crayons in total.;
Response:  Faye has 36 pencils in each of the 7 rows, so she has a total of 24 x 7 = 168 pencils. Similarly, since there are 30 crayons in each of the 7 rows, Faye has a total of 30 x 7 = 210 crayons. Therefore, Faye has a total of 168 pencils + 210 crayons = 378 objects in total.;
Response:  Faye has 11 rows of pencils and crayons. Each row contains 31 pencils and 27 crayons. Therefore, the total number of pencils is 31 x 11 = 341 pencils. Similarly, the total number of crayons is 27 x 11 = 307 crayons. So, Faye has altogether 341 pencils and 307 crayons.;
Response:  If Faye has 30 pencils to place in rows, and there are 5 pencils in each row, then we can create 6 rows (30 / 5 = 6). So, Faye could make 6 rows of pencils.;
Response:  If Faye has 6 pencils and wants to divide them equally between two rows, then each row will have 3 pencils (6 / 2 = 3).;
Response:  Faye has 35 packets of pencils, and each packet contains 4 pencils. To create rows, we must divide these pencils equally among themselves. Therefore, to create one row, we need 4/7 = 0.5714285714285714 pencils from each packet. Since there are 35 packets, we can create 35 x 0.5714285714285714 = 19.69 rows. So, Faye can create approximately 20 rows of pencils using all of her packets.;
Response:  Faye has 31 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. Therefore, Faye has a total of 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Since she wants to place them in rows with 19 pencils in each row, she will need at least 186 / 19 = 10 rows. So, Faye has 10 rows of pencils.;
Response:  Faye has 30 rows of pencils and crayons. Each row contains 24 pencils, so there are 24 x 30 = 720 pencils total. Then, we add the number of crayons to that amount: 720 + 71 = 791 pencils. Therefore, Faye has 791 pencils in total.;
Response:  Faye has 16 rows of crayons and 6 crayons in each row. Therefore, the total number of crayons is 16 x 6 = 96. So, Faye has 96 crayons altogether.;
"Response:  The number of classes = 21. The number of students in the school = 98. And the number of school buses = 7. If all buses are full, then the total number of seats available on the buses = Total number of students - Number of students per bus. So we can write an equation as follows: Seats Available = Students - Students Per Bus. Now let us find out the value of ""Students Per Bus"". We know that there are 98 students in the school and 7 buses, so the number of students per bus = Number of students / Number of buses = 98/7 = 14. Therefore, the number of seats available on each bus = Total number of students - Number of students per bus = 98 - 14 = 84 seats.";
Response:  The number of classrooms = 84. Each school bus can accommodate 118 students (as there are 118 seats per bus). Therefore, the total number of students who will go for the field trip = Number of classrooms x Capacity of each school bus. So, we have: Total no. of students = 84 x 118 = 9624 students.;
Response:  We know that the total number of students in the school is 66 x 67 = 4122 students. Since there are only 6 seats available per bus, we need at least __________ buses to transport all the students for the field trip. So, the answer is 4122 / 6 = approximately 685 buses.;
Response:  We know that the total number of students going on the field trip is 58 and since each classroom has the same number of students, we can assume that all 87 classrooms will be taking part in the field trip. This means that altogether, 87 x 58 = 4960 students will be going on the field trip. Since there are only 2 seats available per bus, we need at least 4960 / 2 = 2480 buses to transport all the students safely. Therefore, the school needs exactly 2480 buses for the field trip.;
Response:  We know that the total number of students in the school is 120 and we also know that each classroom has the same number of students. So, if one classroom has x students, all the other classrooms have x students as well. Therefore, the total number of students in all 24 classrooms is 24x. Since there are 84 seats on each school bus, the maximum number of classes that can go on the field trip at once is 84/24 = 3.5 classes. Thus, the number of students in each class is 3.5 x 24 = 84 students.;
"Response:  We know that the total number of students in the school is 102. Since there are 8 seats available on each bus, we can divide the total number of students by 8 to determine how many buses will be required. Therefore, the calculation would look like this:

Total Number Of Students = 102
Number Of Seats On Each Bus = 8
Required Buses = Total Number Of Students / Number Of Seats On Each Bus
= 102 / 8
= 13
Therefore, 13 buses will be required to transport all the students for the field trip if 22 students decide not to attend.";
Response:  The number of students in the school is given as 102. Each classroom has 11 students, so the total number of students in all classrooms is 102 x 11 = 1122 students. Since 8 students don't want to go on the trip, the number of students who will be going on the trip is 1122 - 8 = 1114 students.;
"Response:  We know that the number of classrooms in the school is 72 and we also know that there are three seats available on each bus. So, to calculate the number of buses required for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students (111) by the number of seats available per bus (3). Therefore, the answer is:
Bus Required = Total Students / Number of Seats Per Bus = 111 / 3 = 37 buses.";
Response:  We know that the number of classrooms in the school is 17. The number of school buses available for the field trip is 46. And the total number of students in the school is 92. If all buses are full, then we can calculate the number of seats per bus as follows: Number of Bus = Total Students / Number of Buses = 92/46 = 2 seats per bus Therefore, each bus has two seats.;
Response:  Haley has 11 boys in her class and they all like playing marbles. If Haley provides 9 marbles to each of them, then the total number of marbles provided is 11 x 9 = 99 marbles. So, Haley had 99 marbles initially.;
"Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and gives 5 marbles to each of the boys who love to play marbles, then...
Number of boys = Total number of marbles given / Number of marbles given per boy
= 10 / 5
= 2
So, Haley gave marbles to 2 boys.";
Response:  Haley has 23 marbles initially, and she wants to distribute them among 4 boys equally. Since there are 4 boys, each boy will get an equal number of marbles. Therefore, each boy will receive 6 marbles (23 / 4 = 6).;
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing marbles, then they will get 26/13 = 2 marbles each. Similarly, if there are 50 boys who like playing cards, they will get 26/50 = 1 marble each. Therefore, each boy will receive either 2 or 1 marble.;
Response:  Haley has 20 marbles and there are 3 children in total - Haley and two boys. If we divide 20 marbles equally among three children, each child will get 6-7 marbles (depending on how you round). So, each boy will receive 6 or 7 marbles.;
Response:  If Haley has 28 marbles and wants to distribute them equally among the boys who like to play marbles, then she will give 2 marbles to each of 14 boys (since there are 14 boys in total). Therefore, Haley gave the marbles to 14 boys.;
Response:  The number of days it took Frank to finish the book is equal to the total number of pages in the book divided by the number of pages he reads per day. So we can write this equation: Number of days = Total pages / Number of pages per day Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Number of days = 392 pages / 14 pages per day Number of days = 27 days Therefore, Frank took 27 days to finish his favorite book.;
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages every day, so if he has been reading for 569 days, then he has read a total of 569 x 22 = 12,388 pages. Therefore, there must be at least 12,388 pages in the book.;
Response:  We know that Frank finished the book in 6 days and there are 612 pages in total. So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank reads per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish the book Time taken to finish the book = 6 days Therefore, Number of pages read per day = 612 pages / 6 days = 102 pages per day;
Response:  We know that Frank finished the book in 220 days and there are 5 chapters in total. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total no. of pages / No. of chapters x 100 Days = 555/5 x 100 = 111 days per chapter Now, since Frank read at a rate of one page every day, we can find out the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total no. of pages / Number of days taken to complete each chapter Pages in each chapter = 555 / 111 = 4.96 pages per chapter Therefore, there are approximately 4.96 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.;
Response:  We know that Frank finished the book in 660 days and there are 15 chapters in total. So, we can calculate the number of days required to complete each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total no. of days / No. of chapters ∝ 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read per day: Pages read per day = Total no. of pages / No. of chapters x Days taken to complete one chapter ∝ 193 pages / 15 chapters x 44 days = 7 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 44 days to complete one chapter.;
Response:  If Frank reads one book in three days, then he reads $ \frac {1}{3} $ of the book per day. Since there are 249 pages in each book, Frank reads $\frac{249}{3}$ pages per day. Therefore, Frank reads $249$ pages per day.;
"Response:  We know that Frank reads one book in 12 days, so he can read $n$ books in $\frac{n}{12}$ days. Since it takes him 492 days to finish all books, we have:
$$\frac{n}{12} = \frac{492}{n}$$
Solving for $n$, we get:
$$n = 492 \times 12 = 5872$$
So, Frank read $5872$ books.";
Response:  We know that Frank finished the book in 16 days and there are 112 pages in the book. To find out how many pages he read each day, we can divide the number of pages he read by the time taken to read them: Number of pages read = Total pages / Time taken (in days) So, Number of pages read = 112 / 16 = 7 pages/day Therefore, Frank read 7 pages per day while reading his favorite book.;
Response:  The number of pages Frank reads each day is given as 8. So, in one day, Frank will have read 8 pages. To find out how many days it takes him to finish the entire book, we can divide the total number of pages (576) by the number of pages he reads per day: 576 / 8 = 72 days. Therefore, Frank took 72 days to finish the book.;
Response:  The total number of pages in Frank's book is given as 41 x 450 = 17650 pages. Since Frank finished the book in 30 days, we can calculate his daily reading rate as follows: Total pages / Number of days = Pages read per day So, the number of pages Frank read per day is: 17650 / 30 = 585 pages per day;
"Response:  We know that Frank read the entire book in 607 days and there were three chapters. So, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows:

Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to complete the book
= 3 x 594 pages/chapter x 607 days
= 182,948 pages

Now, since each chapter has 594 pages, we can find out how many pages are in each chapter as follows:

Pages in each chapter = Total number of pages in the book / Number of chapters
= 182,948 pages / 3 chapters
= 60,986 pages/chapter

Therefore, there are approximately 60,986 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.";
"Response:  We know that Frank finished the book in 664 days and there are two chapters in the book. So, we can calculate the number of days taken to complete one chapter as follows:

Number of days to complete one chapter = Total number of days / Number of chapters
= 664 days / 2 chapters
= 332 days

Now, since Frank read two chapters every day, we can find out how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Number of days taken to complete one chapter
= 2 chapters / 332 days
= 1/332
= 0.03

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.03 chapters per day.";
Response:  If we have 6 packs of DVDs that can be bought with $120, then the total amount spent on all six packs is $120 / 6 = $20 per pack. So, each pack costs $20.;
Response:  If one pack of DVDs costs $81, then three packs would cost $81 x 3 = $243. Therefore, 33 packs of DVDs would cost $243 x 33 = $7,903.;
Response:  If each DVD pack costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 on each pack, then the cost of one DVD pack after the discount is $1 = $106. Now, we want to know how many DVD packs we can buy with $93. To do this, we divide $93 by the cost of one DVD pack after the discount, which is $106. So, we can buy $\frac {93}{106} = 8$ DVD packs with $93$.;
Response:  The cost of one DVD pack without any discount would be $76. If we get a discount of $25 on each pack, then the new price per pack becomes: $76 - $25 = $51. So, to buy each pack, you will have to pay $51.;
Response:  To find out how many DVD packs we can purchase with $104, we must divide $104 by $26, which equals 4. So, we can buy 4 DVD packs with $104.;
Response:  If we have $28 to buy two DVD packs, then the total cost of one pack is $28 / 2 = $14 per pack.;
Response:  If Philip has 18 bananas and he wants to organize them into groups of size 2, then we can start with one group containing 2 bananas (the first two). Now, we have 16 remaining bananas that we need to distribute among the next groups. We can do this by dividing these 16 bananas equally among 8 groups of size 2 each. Therefore, there will be 8 groups of size 2.;
"Response:  We know that Philip has 140 groups of bananas with each group containing 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas Philip has is:

140 x 187 = 23,690
So, Philip has 23,690 bananas in his collection.";
"Response:  We know that Philip has 203 bananas altogether. If we divide this number by 7 (the number of groups for bananas), then we get the size of each group as follows:

Number of bananas / Number of groups = Size of each group
203 / 7 = 28
So, each group of bananas contains 28 bananas. Similarly, we can calculate the size of each group of oranges using the same formula:
If there are 63 oranges and 95 groups for oranges, then the size of each group of oranges would be:

Number of oranges / Number of groups = Size of each group
63 / 95 = 0.66
So, each group of oranges contains approximately 0.66 oranges.";
"Response:  We know that Philip has 142 bananas and 356 oranges in his collection. If we divide the number of bananas by the number of groups he has for them (47), then we get the size of each group of bananas:

Number of bananas / Number of groups = Size of each group of bananas
142 / 47 = 3
So, each group of bananas contains 3 bananas.
Now, let's do the same thing with the oranges. If we divide the number of oranges by the number of groups he has for them (178), then we get the size of each group of oranges:

Number of oranges / Number of groups = Size of each group of oranges
356 / 178 = 2
So, each group of oranges contains 2 oranges.";
Response:  We know that Philip has 196 groups of bananas and a total of 392 bananas in his collection. So, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups to find out how many bananas are in each group: 392 / 196 = 2 Therefore, each group contains 2 bananas.;
"Response:  We know that Philip has 180 bananas and he organizes them into groups based on their sizes. The smallest group contains 18 bananas, so we can write an equation:

Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Number of groups = 180 / 18

Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection (180 / 18 = 10).";
"Response:  We know that Philip has 87 oranges and 290 bananas altogether. If we divide the number of bananas (290) by the total number of fruits (87 + 290 = 377), we get an average size for each group of bananas:

Average size of each group of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of fruits
= 290 / 377
= 0.76

So, each group of bananas contains approximately 76 bananas.";
"Response:  We know that Philip has 384 oranges and 192 bananas. If we divide the number of oranges (384) by the number of groups he wants to make for them (16), then we get the size of each group as follows: Number of oranges per group = Total no. of oranges / No. of groups = 384/16 = 24.
Therefore, each group contains 24 oranges. Similarly, if we divide the number of bananas (192) by the number of groups he wants to make for them (345), then we get the size of each group as follows: Number of bananas per group = Total no. of bananas / No. of groups = 192/345 = 0.57. Therefore, each group contains approximately 0.57 bananas.";
Response:  Brenda's mom baked 38 cookies in total. Each cookie has 19 pieces, so we can calculate the number of guests as follows: Total number of cookies = Number of pieces per cookie x Total number of cookies = 19 x 38 = 702 guests. Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 702 guests.;
Response:  Brenda and her friends shared cookies among themselves equally. So, if they shared 30 cookies between them, that means each person got 30/14 = 2.14 (approximately) cookies. Since we can't have fractional cookies, let's round up to 2 cookies per friend. Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 14 x 2 = 28 cookies in total.;
Response:  Brenda's mom baked 22 cookies in total. However, she threw away 17 cookies, leaving her with 5 remaining cookies. To find out how many cookies each person got, we need to divide the total number of cookies (22) by the number of people who received cookies (5). So, each person got 4 cookies (22 / 5 = 4).;
Response:  Brenda's mom baked 18 cookies in total. If 9 guests didn't show up, then there are 10 - 9 = 1 guests left. So, each of the remaining guests got 18 / 10 = 1.8 cookies per person (round down to 1 cookie).;
Response:  If Brenda's mom made 14 cookies and there were two guests, then each guest received half of the total number of cookies (14). Therefore, each guest got 7 cookies (half of 14).;
"Response:  If Brenda's mom made 10 cookies in total and each guest received 2 cookies, then the number of guests must be equal to half of the total number of cookies. Therefore, we can write this equation: 10 = (number of guests) x 2. To solve for ""number of guests,"" divide both sides of the equation by 2: 5 = number of guests. So, Brenda's mom prepared cookies for 5 guests.";
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and wants to divide them equally among two bags, then each bag will contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy. Therefore, there are 21 pieces of candy in each bag.;
"Response:  If Frank has $X$ pieces of candy and wants to divide them equally among $26$ bags, then each bag will contain $\frac{X}{26}$ pieces of candy. Since there are $33$ pieces of candy in each bag, we can write:
$$\frac{X}{26} \times 33 = X$$
Now, solve for $X$:
$$X = 26 \times 33 = 840$$
So, Frank has $840$ pieces of candy.";
Response:  Frank initially has 33 pieces of candy and loses 24 of them. So now he has 33 - 24 = 9 pieces left. If he puts these pieces into bags with 9 pieces in each bag, then he will have 9 / 1 = 9 bags.;
Response:  If Frank has 22 pieces of candy and wants to divide them equally among bags, then he will have 22 / 11 = 2 bags. Therefore, Frank will have 2 bags.;
Response:  If Frank has 16 pieces of candy and wants to divide them equally among two bags, then each bag will contain 8 pieces of candy (16 / 2 = 8).;
"Response:  Shirley needs to deliver x number of boxes of Trefoils. Since each case contains 14 boxes and Shirley sold 25 cases, we can write an equation as follows: 
x = 25 / 14 
x = 176/14 
x = 12
Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 12 boxes of Trefoils.";
Response:  If Shirley sold 10 boxes of Trefoils and needed to deliver 5 cases of boxes, then we can calculate the number of boxes per case as follows: Number of boxes per case = Total number of boxes / Number of cases = 10 boxes / 5 cases = 2 boxes per case. Therefore, there are 2 boxes per case that Shirley needs to deliver.;
"Response:  We know that there are 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in total. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda there are, we can subtract the number of diet soda from the number of regular soda:

67 - 9 = 58

So, there are 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda at the grocery store.";
"Response:  We know that there are 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda in total. So we can write this as an equation: 
Regular Soda = 22 Bottles
Diet Soda = 61 - 22 = 39 Bottles
Therefore, there are 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.";
Response:  The grocery store has 30 bottles of regular soda, which is equal to 30/1 = 30 bottles. Then, it has 8 bottles of diet soda, which is equal to 8/1 = 8 bottles. Finally, it has 41 apples, which is equal to 41/1 = 41 apples. Therefore, in total, the grocery store has 30 + 8 + 41 = 79 bottles.;
"Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in total. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of diet soda from the number of regular soda. So, let's do this calculation:

79 - 53 = 26

Therefore, the grocery store has 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.";
"Response:  We know that there are 83 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda the store has, we need to subtract the number of diet soda from the number of regular soda. So, we can write this as follows:

Number of regular soda - Number of diet soda = More regular soda

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation:

83 - 54 = 29

So, the store has 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.";
Response:  The number of bottles of regular soda is 9. Since the remaining are not regular soda, it means that the number of bottles of diet soda = Total - Number of regular soda = 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 bottles of diet soda in the store.;
"Response:  We know that there are 60 bottles of regular soda and 19 bottles of diet soda in total. So we can write this as an equation:

Regular Soda = 60
Diet Soda = 19
Now let's subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas to find out how many more regular sodas there are:
More Regular Soda = Total Sodas - Diet Sodas
= 60 - 19
= 41
So, there are 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda at the grocery store.";
Response:  The total number of bottles is given as 72 + 32 = 104 bottles of soda (both regular and diet). Since there are 78 apples, we need to find out how many more bottles there are than apples. To do this, divide the number of bottles by the number of apples: 104 / 78 = 1.35. So, the grocery store has about 1.35 times more bottles than apples.;
"Response:  We know that there are 36 apples in total. The number of bottles is given as follows:
* Regular soda = 80 bottles
* Diet soda = 54 bottles
So, we need to find out how many more bottles there are compared to apples. To do this, divide the number of bottles (80 + 54) by the number of apples (36):
(80 + 54) / 36 = 126/36 = 3.5
Therefore, the grocery store has 3.5 times more bottles than apples.";
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles in total. Of those, 28 are regular sodas, so we can say that x = 28 (the number of regular sodas). Therefore, the number of diet sodas is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. So, the answer is 2 bottles of diet soda.;
"Response:  If the grocery store has 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, then the total number of bottles of regular soda is:

Total = 4 + (79 - 4) = 83

Therefore, the grocery store has 83 bottles of regular soda.";
Response:  The grocery store has 57 bottles of regular soda, which is equal to 57 x 1 = 57 bottles. Then it has 26 bottles of diet soda, which is equal to 26 x 1 = 26 bottles. Finally, it has 27 bottles of lite soda, which is equal to 27 x 1 = 27 bottles. Therefore, in total, the grocery store has 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 bottles of soda.;
Response:  The total number of bottles is given as follows: 81 + 60 + 60 = 201. Now we need to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are compared to diet soda. So, let's subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas: 201 - 60 = 141. Therefore, there are 141 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.;
"Response:  The total number of bottles = Number of regular soda + Number of Diet Soda + Number of Lite Soda. 
So, Total No. Of Bottles = 49 + 40 + 6 = 105. Therefore, there are 105 bottles of regular soda and diet soda in the grocery store together.";
"Response:  If 317 people visited Buckingham Palace today and 295 people visited it yesterday, we can determine the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22
Therefore, 22 more individuals visited Buckingham Palace on this particular day compared to the previous day.";
"Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in one day is given as 703. To find out how many visitors came to the palace within 25 days, we need to multiply this number by 25. So, the total number of visitors who came to the palace within 25 days is:

703 x 25 = 17,550

Therefore, the answer is 17,550 visitors.";
"Response:  If 100 people visited Buckingham Palace on the previous day and Rachel visited it after having a hearty meal, then the number of visitors on the current day (the day Rachel visited) is:

Current Day Visitors = Previous Day Visitors + Rachel's Group Size - Number of People in Rachel's Group Who Ate Before Going to Buckingham Palace

Let's assume the group size was 8 people (including Rachel). Since Rachel had a hearty meal before going to Buckingham Palace, let's subtract 2 people from the total number of visitors (to account for those who ate before going):

Current Day Visitors = 100 + 8 - 2 = 106

Therefore, there are 106 more visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day.";
Response:  We know that in total, 406 individuals visited Buckingham Palace over the last 327 days. So, we can assume that 406 / 327 = x number of guests per day on average. Since Rachel saw 132 tourists at the palace on the particular day she visited, we may infer that x - 132 = the number of daily visitors to Buckingham Palace on the preceding day. Therefore, the response is (x - 132) = 194.;
Response:  We know that in total, 829 individuals visited Buckingham Palace over an 85-day period. If Rachel and her companion saw the palace after consuming a substantial supper, we can assume it was during this time frame. So, the number of guests who visited the palace on the specific day is equal to 829 divided by 85 = 9.76 (round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, approximately 10 visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the particular day.;
"Response:  The number of visitors per day is given as follows:
Day 1: 188 visitors
Day 2: 557 visitors (total visitors = 71 x 557)
Now we need to find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace within 57 days. We can do this by multiplying the average daily visitors by 57:
Average Daily Visitors = Total Number of Visitors / Number of Days
= 71 x 557 / 57
= 3609 visitors
Therefore, within 57 days, approximately 3609 people visited Buckingham Palace.";
"Response:  The number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel and her family went is given as 661. On the previous day, the number of visitors was 600. To find out how many more visitors visited the palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from one day to the next:

661 - 600 = 61

Therefore, 61 more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel and her family went compared to the previous day.";
"Response:  We know that Rachel visited Buckingham Palace after eating a hearty meal. So let's assume that she visited the palace on Day X.
We are given three pieces of information about the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on different days:
Day X (Rachel's visit): 92 visitors came to the palace.
The previous day (Day X-1): 419 visitors came to the palace.
Two days ago (Day X-2): 103 visitors came to the palace.
Now, we need to find out how many visitors came to the palace on some earlier day(s) before Rachel's visit. To do this, we can use the information provided in the question as follows:
Let Y be the number of visitors who came to the palace on some earlier day(s).
Then, we know that the total number of visitors to the palace over the past few days is:
Y + 419 + 103 = 525
Since Rachel visited the palace on Day X, we know that X - 1 ≤ X ≤ X + 2. Taking the average of these two inequalities gives us:
X ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}
Now, substituting X = 4 into the equation above, we get:
4 + 419 + 103 = 525
Solving for Y, we get:
Y = 386
Therefore, before Rachel visited Buckingham Palace, approximately 386 people visited the palace.";
"Response:  The information given in the question is as follows:
Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2: 808 visitors
Day 3 (the day Rachel visited): 512 visitors
To find out how many visitors have come to Buckingham Palace over the last 89 days, we need to add up all these numbers:
471 + 808 + 512 = 1791
Therefore, within the past 89 days, 1791 people visited Buckingham Palace.";
"Response:  The information given in the question is as follows:
Day Visitors (Rachel) Buckingham Palace
Monday 191
Tuesday Rachel didn't visit
Wednesday 457
Thursday 705
Now we need to find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on Thursday compared to the previous 245 days. To do this, we will subtract the number of visitors on Monday from the number of visitors on Thursday:
Number of More Visitors = 705 - 191 = 514
Therefore, 514 more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on Thursday compared to the previous 245 days.";
Response:  We know that the person has 479g of wax so far and wants to add another 159g for sticking the feathers together. So, the total amount of wax he has is: 479 + 159 = 638g.;
"Response:  We know that the person has $X$ amount of wax so far, which is less than the required amount ($288g$). We also know that each feather requires $288g$ of wax to stick the feathers together. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

$$ X + (49g) = 288g $$

Now, let's solve for $X$. To do this, subtract $(49g)$ from both sides of the equation:

$$ X = 239g $$

Therefore, the person currently has $239g$ of wax.";
Response:  We know that the person has 100g of wax so far, and he needs an additional 22g of wax to complete the task. Therefore, the total amount of wax he currently has is 100 + 22 = 122g.;
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required is 166g since we have already used 20g. So, we need an additional 146g (166-20) of wax.;
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required is 17g, and our friend currently has 557g of wax. So we can set up an equation as follows:

557 - (17 x number of feathers) = 0

Now let's solve for the number of feathers:

number of feathers = 557 / 17 = 32

So the feathers require 32 grams of wax each.";
Response:  We know that the number of feathers is 492 / 11 = 44 feathers. So, we must calculate how much wax each feather requires. Therefore, the amount of wax needed for all feathers is 44 x 11 = 484 grams. Since he already has 11 grams of wax, he needs an additional 473 grams (484 - 11).;
"Response:  The total number of drums filled is equal to the number of pickers multiplied by the amount of grapes each picker fills. So we have:

Number of drums = Number of pickers x Amount of grapes per picker
= 94 pickers x 90 drums/day
= 8560 drums/day
Therefore, approximately 8560 drums of grapes are filled per day.";
"Response:  The total number of drums filled is given as 90, and the time taken to fill them is 5 days. So, we can calculate the daily output of grapes as follows:

Daily Output = Total Number of Drums / Time Taken
= 90 / 5
= 18 drums per day
Therefore, 18 drums of grapes are filled every day.";
"Response:  The number of drums of grapes filled each day is given as $244$. To find out how many drums will be filled in $146$ days, we need to multiply the daily output by $146$. Therefore, the total number of drums of grapes filled in $146$ days is:
$$= 244 \times 146 = 35080$$
So, there will be $35080$ drums of grapes filled in $146$ days.";
"Response:  The number of drums of grapes picked each day is given as 221 drums. To find out how many drums will be filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of drums picked each day by 77. So, the total number of drums of grapes that will be filled is:

221 drums/day x 77 days = 16,477 drums
Therefore, 16,477 drums of grapes will be filled in 77 days.";
"Response:  The number of drums of grapes picked each day is given as 108. If there are 58 days, then the total number of drums of grapes picked is:

108 x 58 = 6344 drums of grapes
Therefore, in 58 days, 6344 drums of grapes would be filled.";
Response:  If 36 pickers can fill 8 drums of grapes per day, then in one day, they can fill 36 x 8 = 288 drums of grapes. To find out how many days it will take to fill 240 drums of grapes, we divide the total number of drums by the number of drums filled per day: 240 / 288 = 85 days. Therefore, it will take 85 days to fill 240 drums of grapes.;
Response:  We know that there are 52 saltwater animals in total, and John has 26 aquariums. So, we can say that each aquarium contains 52 / 26 = 2 saltwater animals.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 saltwater animals altogether and each aquarium contains 2 animals. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of aquariums = Number of animals / Number of animals per aquarium. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, the person had 20 aquariums.;
Response:  Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater animals, which means he has 56 x 39 = 2174 saltwater animals altogether!;
"Response:  We know that Tyler has 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Each aquarium contains 46 animals, so the total number of saltwater animals Tyler has is:

22 x 46 = 980

Therefore, Tyler has 980 saltwater animals.";
"Response: 
Saltwater Aquariums = 15 x 19 = 285 animals
Freshwater Aquariums = 62 x 19 = 1138 animals
Total Animals = Saltwater + Freshwater = 285 + 1138 = 1423 animals
Therefore, John has 1423 animals in total.";
Response:  If White T-shirts can be bought in packages of 13, then Mom would buy 39 / 13 = 3 packages of White T-Shirts. Therefore, Mom will have 3 packages of White T-Shirts.;
"Response:  If Mom buys 66 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then...
1. How many packages of white T-shirts does Mom buy?
Mom buys 66 / 3 = 22 packages of white T-shirts.
Therefore, Mom will have 22 packages.";
Response:  If Mom purchases 28 packages of white T-shirts and each package contains 56 white T-shirts in total, then we can calculate the number of white T-shirts per package as follows: Number of White T-Shirts = Total Number of White T-Shirts / Number of Packages = 56 / 28 = 2 White T-Shirts per Package. Therefore, each package has 2 white T-shirts.;
Response:  If Mom purchases 57 packages of white T-shirts, each package contains 53 White T-shirts, so the total number of White T-shirts = 57 x 53 = 2910 White T-shirts. Now, let's calculate the number of White T-shirts Mom has after buying both White T-shirts and Trousers. The total number of White T-shirts = 2910 White T-shirts + 34 Trousers (which are not counted as part of the package) = 2910 + 34 = 2944 White T-shirts. Therefore, Mom will have 2944 White T-shirts altogether.;
"Response:  If Mom bought 51 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 T-shirts, then...

Mom has 51 / 3 = 17 packages of T-shirts.";
Response:  If Mom bought 70 white T-shirts in total, then she must have bought at least one package of them since packages are mentioned in the problem statement. So, let's assume that Mom bought exactly one package of white T-shirts. Then, according to the problem statement, Mom bought 14 packages of T-shirts in total. Since each package contains White T-shirts, we can conclude that each package has White T-shirts. Therefore, the number of White T-shirts in each package is equal to the total number of White T-shirts Mom bought divided by the number of packages she bought. In this case, the total number of White T-shirts Mom bought is 70, and the number of packages she bought is 14. Therefore, the number of White T-shirts in each package is: 70 / 14 = 5. So, each package contains 5 White T-shirts.;
Response:  If there are 36 cookies in total and we have 4 bags, then each bag has 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9). ;
"Response:  If we have 33 cookies in total, and each bag contains 11 cookies, then we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags to find out how many bags we have:

33 / 11 = 3
So, we have 3 bags of cookies.";
Response:  If there are 53 bags of cookies and each bag contains 41 cookies, then we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:  53 x 41 = 2193 cookies. Therefore, if you had 53 bags of cookies, you would have a total of 2193 cookies.;
Response:  If there are 14 cookies in total and 7 bags with an equal number of cookies, then we can say that each bag has 14/7 = 2 cookies. Therefore, each bag contains 2 cookies.;
Response:  If there are 21 cookies in total and each bag contains 3 cookies then we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag to find out how many bags of cookies we have. So, 21 cookies / 3 cookies per bag = 7 bags of cookies. Therefore, you have 7 bags of cookies.;
Response:  We know that there are 26 bags with an equal number of cookies. If we add up all the numbers from 1 to 26, we get 15 + 24 = 39. So, there must be 39 bags of cookies.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 bags of cookies initially. If we add 28 cookies to them, then each bag will contain 28/14 = 2 cookies more than before. Similarly, if we add 86 candies to them, then each bag will contain 86/14 = 6 candies more than before. Therefore, we can conclude that there are 14/2 = 7 bags of cookies left after adding 28 cookies and 86 candies together. So, we have 7 bags of cookies.;
Response:  The mailman needs to deliver 5 pieces of junk mail to every block. If he delivers 25 letters to each home in a block, then there must be 25/5 = 5 homes per block. Therefore,there are five houses in each block.  ;
"Response:  The mailman needs to deliver 9 pieces of junk mail to every house in each block. Since there are 20 houses per block, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman needs to deliver is:

20 x 9 = 180 pieces of junk mail

So, the mailman will need to deliver 180 pieces of junk mail in each block.";
Response:  If there are six houses on a block and the mailman needs to deliver 24 pieces of junk mail to each block, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman will need to deliver is 6 x 24 = 144 pieces of junk mail. Therefore, the mailman will have to give 144/6 = 23 pieces of junk mail to each house on the block.;
"Response:  If the mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block and he needs to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, then the number of blocks is equal to the total number of houses divided by 14. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Blocks = Total Houses / 14. Now, let's substitute the value given in the problem for ""Total Houses"": There are 30 houses in a block. Therefore, we can plug this value into our equation: Number of Blocks = 30 / 14 = 2. So, there are two blocks in total.";
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in one block and the mailman needs to deliver 32 pieces of junk mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman will need to deliver is:

20 houses x 32 pieces/house = 640 pieces of junk mail per block

So, the mailman will need to deliver 640 pieces of junk mail to each block.";
"Response:  The total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman needs to distribute is given as $30 \times 78 = 2340$. Since there are $19$ houses per block, and we need to divide this amount among them, we can calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each house will receive as follows:

$$\therefore \text{Number of pieces of junk mail each house will receive} = \frac {2340}{19} = 125$$

So, each house will receive $125$ pieces of junk mail.";
"Response:  The mailman needs to deliver 8 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he delivers 32 pieces of mail to each house in a block, then we can calculate the number of houses in a block as follows:
Number of houses in a block = Total number of houses x Number of pieces of mail delivered per house / Number of pieces of junk mail to be delivered per block
= 55 blocks x 32 pieces of mail/house / 8 pieces of junk mail/block
= 1600 houses in a block
Therefore, there are 1600 houses in a block.";
Response:  The mailman needs to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to every house in each of the 81 blocks. Since there are 12 houses in each block, the mailman will need to deliver 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of junk mail per block. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman should give in each block is 81 x 48 = 3696 pieces of junk mail.;
Response:  The mailman needs to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to every house in each of the 16 blocks. Therefore, the overall number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman must distribute is equal to 16 x 4 = 64. So, the mailman will need to give out 64 pieces of junk mail altogether.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 marbles in total. If she divides them equally among 4 groups, each group will have 5 marbles (20 / 4 = 5). So, Rebecca will create 5 groups.;
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs. To divide them into groups of 5, we need to find out how many times 10 can go into 15.

So, we divide 10 by 5:

10 / 5 = 2

Therefore, Rebecca can create 2 groups of 5 eggs each using her 10 marbles.";
"Response:  Rebecca has a total number of eggs = x. Since she wants to split them into groups of 11 with 2 eggs in each group, we can write it as:
x / 11 = 2
Now, multiply both sides by 11 to get rid of the fraction:
x × 11 = 22
So, Rebecca has 22 eggs.";
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs in total. She also has 6 marbles. Since she wants to split the eggs into 4 groups, we need to divide them equally among the groups. Therefore, each group will get 2 eggs (since 8 / 4 = 2). So, each group will have 2 eggs.;
Response:  We know Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. If she splits them equally among three groups, then each group will get 5 eggs (since 15 / 3 = 5). So, each group will have 5 eggs.;
"Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to split the collection of eggs into groups of 6. So we need to divide the total number of eggs (18) by 6.

So, the number of groups that will be created is:

18 / 6 = 3

Therefore, Rebecca will create 3 groups of eggs.";
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to split the collection of eggs into groups of 3. So we need to divide the total number of eggs by 3. In this case, there are 9 eggs in total. Therefore, we can create 3 groups of eggs with 3 eggs each. Now let's move on to the other items given in the problem: Bananas - There are 99 bananas. Since we have already divided the eggs into groups of 3, we don't need to do anything with the bananas yet. Marbles - There are 27 marbles. Since we haven't done anything with the bananas yet, we also don't need to do anything with the marbles for now. Based on the information provided above, we can conclude that Rebecca will create 3 groups of eggs.;
Response:  Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. To group the eggs into sets of 5, she will need 4 such sets or 4 x 5 = 20 eggs. So, Rebecca has 20 - 6 = 14 eggs left after grouping them into sets of 5. Therefore, Rebecca has 14 more eggs than marbles (6).;
"Response:  Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. To group them in sets of 20, she needs additional eggs. So, the difference between the number of eggs and marbles is equal to the number of groups of 20 that can be formed with her available resources. In this case, we need to find out how many groups of 20 can be made using 12 eggs and 5 marbles. We can do this as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per group
= 12 eggs / 20 eggs per group
= 3/4 or 0.75 groups
Therefore, Rebecca has 3 more eggs than marbles (or 0.75 groups).";
"Response:  We know that Luke scored 154 points in total. If he gained 11 points in each round, then we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of rounds x Gain per round So, substituting the given information into this equation, we get: Total score = Number of rounds x 11 Points/round Now, we want to find out how many rounds Luke played. Therefore, we need to solve for the value of ""Number of rounds"" in the above equation. Solving for it, we get: Number of rounds = Total score / (Gain per round) = 154 points / 11 points/round = 14 rounds Thus, Luke played 14 rounds in the trivia game.";
"Response:  Luke played 177 rounds of a trivia game and gained 46 points in each round. Therefore, the total number of points Luke scored in the game is:

Total points = Number of rounds x Points per round
= 177 x 46
= 8,392

Therefore, Luke scored 8,392 points in the game.";
"Response:  If Luke scored 84 points in total after two rounds of a trivia game, then he must have scored x points in each round, where x is the total number of points Luke scored divided by 2 (since there are two rounds). So, we can set up an equation as follows:
x + x = 84
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 84
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 42
Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per round.";
Response:  Luke scored 146 points per round, so he scored a total of 146 x 157 = 22,382 points in the entire game.;
Response:  If Luke earned three points for every round he participated in, then he received $3 x number of rounds = total score$ points overall. Since Luke got 78 points, we can set up an equation as follows: Number of rounds = Total score / 3 $ Number of rounds = 78/3 = 26$ Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds in the trivia game.;
Response:  Emily has 2 beads in total, which means that each bead can be used once or twice (since there are only two beads). If each bead needs to be used once, then each necklace will have one bead. However, if each bead can be used twice, then each necklace will have two beads. So, we can conclude that each necklace needed either one or two beads.;
Response:  We know that Emily has to make 11 necklaces, and each necklace requires 28 beads. So, we can calculate the total number of beads needed as follows: Total Number of Beads = Number of Necklaces x Number of Beads per Necklace Total Number of Beads = 11 x 28 Total Number of Beads = 308 beads Therefore, Emily had 308 beads in total.;

Answer: Great! We know that there are 5 shelves on the bookshelf, and each shelf can hold 8 books. So, if we multiply these two numbers together, we get... See full solution";
"Response:  Emily made 18 necklaces in total, so we can write this as 18 = x, where ""x"" represents the number of beads needed for one necklace. Since there are 6 beads available, we can set up an equation: 18 = 6x. Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for x: x = 18/6 = 3. So, each necklace required 3 beads.";
Response:  If Emily makes one bead necklace that requires 5 beads per necklace, then she needs 5 beads to make one necklace. Since Emily made four necklaces, she needed 20 beads (4 x 5 = 20) to make all of them. So, Emily had 20 beads in total.;
"Response:  Emily needs to make 72 necklaces, and each necklace requires 3 beads. So, we need to find out how many groups of 3 beads Emily will have after using all her beads. We can do this as follows:

Emily has 6 beads in total. To determine how many groups of 3 beads she can make, divide 6 by 3:

6 / 3 = 2

So, Emily can make 2 groups of 3 beads each. Therefore, she can make 2 x 3 = 6 necklaces.";
Response:  Emily has 5 beads in total, which means that if she wants to make one necklace, she will use 1 of those 5 beads. So, if she makes 20 necklaces, then she uses all 5 beads. Therefore, each necklace needs 5 beads.;
Response:  Emily has to make 44 necklaces, so she needs 44 x 2 = 88 beads in total. Since each necklace requires 2 beads, Emily will need 88 / 2 = 44 beads. So, Emily had 44 beads.;
Response:  According to the question, 819058 children attend camp in Lawrence County throughout the summer holidays. The remaining 668278 youngsters remain at home. To determine how many additional kids went to camp than remained at home, we must subtract the number of kids that remained at home from the total number of kids who attended camp. Therefore, the difference between these two numbers is:  819058 - 668278 = 150780. So, there are 150780 more kids who went to camp than stayed at home.;
Response:  The total number of kids in Lawrence County is 1553400 (according to the question). Now, we know that 202958 kids went to camp, which means that 777622 - 202958 = 574664 kids stayed at home. Therefore, there are 574664 more kids who stayed home than those who went to camp.;
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is 898051. During summer break, 629424 children attend camp, leaving 268627 children at home. Therefore, 268627 children stay home.;
Response:  We know that out of 313473 children in Lawrence County, 274865 remain at home during the summer holidays. This implies that 38509 (313473 - 274865) children attend camps or other activities outside their homes. Therefore, 38509 is the number of children who go to camp during the summer vacation.;
Response:  We know that out of 907611 kids from Lawrence County, 455682 kids go to camp during summer break. So, we can calculate the number of kids who stay at home as follows: Number of kids who stay at home = Total number of kids - Number of kids who go to camp Number of kids who stay at home = 907611 - 455682 Number of kids who stay at home = 451939 kids From this calculation, we can conclude that there are approximately 451939 kids who stay at home in Lawrence County during summer break.;
Response:  We know that out of 828521 total children in Lawrence County, 800059 went to camp during the summer break. This means that the number of children who stayed at home is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who went to camp. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Number of Children Who Stayed Home = Total Number of Children - Number of Children Who Went to Camp. Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of Children Who Stayed Home = 828521 - 800059 = 284662. So, approximately 33% (or 284662) of the total number of children in Lawrence County stayed home during the summer break.;
Response:  We know that out of 91676 children in Lawrence County, 61619 remained at home during the summer break. This means that the remaining 30057 children attended camp. Therefore, approximately 32% (or 30057/91676) of the children in Lawrence County went to camp.;
"Response: 
Total number of kids from Lawrence County = 34044 + (134867 x 0) = 34044 + 0 = 34044
Additional kids from outside the county = 424944
Total number of kids attending the camp = Total number of kids from Lawrence County + Additional kids from outside the county = 34044 + 424944 = 458388
Therefore, a total of 458388 kids attended the camp.";
Response:  We know that out of 610769 kids in Lawrence County, 610769 x 0 = 0 kids attend camp. Outside the county, there are 22 kids who attended camp. So, the total number of kids in Lawrence County is 610769 - 22 = 608547 kids.;
"Response:  We know that out of 644997 kids who remained at home, 893835 kids went to camp. This means that the number of kids who did not go to camp is equal to the total number of kids minus the number of kids who went to camp. So we can write this as follows:

Number of kids who didn't go to camp = Total number of kids - Number of kids who went to camp
= 644997 - 893835
= -250000

Now, we also know that there were 78 kids from outside the county who attended the camp. Therefore, we can add these kids to both sides of the equation:

Number of kids who didn't go to camp + Number of kids from outside the county who attended the camp = Total number of kids

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

-250000 + 78 = 645000

Therefore, the number of kids in Lawrence County is 645000.";
"Response:  We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total. So, if we subtract 9 from 12 (which is the sum of Adam and Jackie's apple count), we get: 

12 - 9 = 3

Therefore, Jackie has 3 apples.";
"Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So, the answer is:
Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie.";
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the answer is: Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 more apple than Adam.;
"Response:  Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:

10 - 8 = 2

Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.";
Response:  Adam and Jackie have 6 apples in total. If they have 4 more apples than that means they have 10 (6 + 4) apples altogether. So, the person who has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie has 14 apples (10 + 4).;
Response:  Adam and Jackie have 7 apples in total. If 9 apples are more than what they have, then 2 = number of apples that Adam and Jackie have. So, Has has 10 apples (9 - 2).;
Response:  Adam and Jackie have altogether 12 apples. If Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie has 4 apples (12 - 8 = 4). So, to find out how many apples Has, we need to add the number of apples that Adam has to the number of apples that Jackie has: 4 + 8 = 12. Therefore, Has has 12 apples.;
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 = 10 apples (since Jackie has 10 apples). Since they both together have 2 apples, we can say that Adam has x/2 apples. Now, to find out how many apples Adam has, we need to add 6 more apples to his total: x/2 + 6 = 10. Solving for x, we get Adam has 8 apples. So, Adam has 8 apples.;
Response:  Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, so if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 5 = 76 (since Jackie has 89 oranges). So, Adam has 76 apples.;
Response:  We know that Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday, 270 cookies this morning, and 419 cookies the day before yesterday. So, in total, she baked 31 + 270 + 419 = 620 cookies until last night.;
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 raisin cookies. So, in total, she baked 90 + 51 = 141 cookies yesterday.

"Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 527 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 86 more today, so the total number of chocolate chip cookies that Helen baked is:

527 + 86 = 613

Therefore, Helen baked 613 chocolate chip cookies in total.";
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 85 raisin cookies yesterday + 403 chocolate chip cookies today = 488 cookies in total. Since we were asked how many raisin cookies Helen baked, we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies from the total number of cookies to get the answer: 488 - 397 = 91 raisin cookies. So, Helen baked 91 raisin cookies.;
Response:  According to the question, Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 237 chocolate chip cookies today. So, in total, she has baked 256 chocolate chip cookies (19 + 237). Now, let's find out how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked than raisin cookies. The number of raisin cookies is given as 231. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and raisin cookies is: 256 - 231 = 25. So, Helen baked 25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies.;
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 75 more chocolate chip cookies, so the total number of chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday is 197 + 75 = 272. Therefore, Helen baked 75 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday than she did today.;
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 280 raisin cookies + 300 raisin cookies = 580 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 359 chocolate chip cookies + 280 raisin cookies = 639 total cookies. So, Helen baked 59 more raisin cookies yesterday than she did today.;

Response:  Fred initially had $60, then Jason added $19 to it, making a total of $79. Now, after washing cars, Jason gained an additional amount of $33, bringing his new total to $72 (=$79 + $33). So, Jason made $72 from washing cars.;
Response:  Fred initially had $86 + Jason had $5 = $91. Then, Fred made $9 - $86 = -$77 from washing cars. So, Fred currently has $9 - (-$77) = $86. Similarly, Jason didn't work so he still has $5. Therefore, their total amount of money is $86 (Fred) + $5 (Jason) = $91.;
Response:  Fred started with $19, then he earned $21 (since Jason had $16). So, Fred gained $21 + $19 = $40. Therefore, Fred earned $40 over the weekend.;
Response:  Fred started with $114 and lost $93 ($114 - $21 = $93). Jason started with $22 and gained $56 ($22 + $78 = $98). So, Jason made $56 over the weekend.;
Response:  Fred had $111 initially, then he earned $4 from washing cars, so his new amount is $115 = $111 + $4. Similarly, Jason had $40 initially, then he earned $6 from delivering newspapers, so his new amount is $44 = $40 + $6. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by washing cars is $115 - $40 = $75.;
Response:  Fred had $49 before he started working, then he earned $73 from washing cars ($112 - $49). Jason had $3 before starting to work, so he earned $60 from delivering newspapers ($63 - $3). Therefore, Fred earned $73 from washing cars and Jason earned $60 from delivering newspapers.;
Response:  Jason had $31 at first, then he earned $14 from delivering newspapers, so his new amount is $45 ($31 + $14). Fred started with $78 and earned $90 from washing cars, for a total of $168 ($78 + $90). So, Jason earned $45 from delivering newspapers, while Fred earned $168.;
Response:  Fred initially had $33 + Jason had $95 = Total initial amount of money = $128. Then, during the weekend, Fred earned $16 from delivering newspapers and $74 from washing cars. So, total amount earned by Fred = $16 + $74 = $90. Therefore, the amount of money that Fred earned over the weekend is $90.;
Response:  Fred initially had $47 + Jason had $99 = Total initial amount of money = $146. Then, during the weekend, Fred earned $111 from delivering newspapers and $34 from washing cars, so his new total amount is: $146 + ($111 + $34) = $281. Therefore, Fred has $281 now.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 71 kg and then lost 20 kg through regular jogging. So her current weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kg.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 27 kg and then lost 10 kg while running daily. So her new weight is 27 + (10 - 10) = 37 kg. Therefore, Jessie originally weighed 37 kg before beginning to run.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed x kg and then began running daily. After doing so for some time, her weight decreased by 126 kg. So, now she weighs 66 kg. To find out what her initial weight was, we can use the equation: 66 = x - 126. Solving for x, we get: x = 192 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed 192 kg before beginning to run regularly.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 69 kg and then began running daily, resulting in her losing 35 kg. So, right now, Jessie weighs 69 + (–35) = 34 kg.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 114 kg, which means she lost 50 kg during her first week of jogging (since she lost 50 kg / 7 days = 7 kg per day). Then, she continued jogging for another week and lost an additional 60 kg, bringing her total weight loss to 110 kg (i.e., 60 kg + 50 kg = 110 kg). So, Jessie currently weighs 110 kg.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 9 kg + x kg = 9 + x kg. Since she lost 62 kg during her first week of jogging, her new weight is 9 + x - 62 = x kg. Similarly, since she lost another 140 kg during her second week of jogging, her new weight is x - 140 = y kg. Now, we are given that Jessie currently weighs 9 kg, so we can set up an equation as follows: 9 = y + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 9 - y. Substituting this value back into the previous equation gives us: y = 9 - (9 - y) = 9 - (-y). Simplifying, we have: y = 9 + y. Therefore, Jessie originally weighed 9 kg before starting to jog.;
Response:  Jessie initially weighed 92 kg. In Week 1, she lost 56 kg, so her new weight is 92 - 56 = 36 kg. In Week 2, she lost an additional 99 kg, bringing her total loss to 99 + 56 = 155 kg. So, after the first week of jogging, Jessie weighed 36 kg.;
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in total in the cage. If 64 of them are hiding, then the number of non-hiding snakes is equal to 95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, there are 31 snakes that are not hiding in the cage.;
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes in the cage. If 40 of them are hiding, then we have 53 non-hiding snakes (93 - 40 = 53). Now, let's consider the alligators. The question states that there are 97 alligators in the cage, including those who are hiding. So, if 40 of them are hiding, then we have 57 non-hiding alligators (97 - 40 = 57). Therefore, there are 53 snakes and 57 alligators that are not hiding in the cage.;
Response:  The total number of reptiles in the cage is 3 + 75 = 78. If 82 snakes are hidden, then there are 82 - 3 = 79 snakes that are not hidden. Since there are only 19 alligators that are not hidden, we can conclude that 79 / 19 = 4 alligators are not hiding. Therefore, 4 alligators are not hiding.;
Response:  The total number of animals in the cage is 79. If 24 snakes are hiding, then the remaining non-hiding snakes are 79 - 24 = 55. Similarly, if 51 alligators are hiding, then the remaining non-hiding alligators are 79 - 51 = 28. Therefore, there are 55 snakes and 28 alligators that are not hiding in the cage.;
Response:  The farmer has 171 tomatoes initially. He picks 134 tomatoes yesterday, leaving him with 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes. Today, he picks another 30 tomatoes, leaving him with 37 - 30 = 7 tomatoes. Therefore, the farmer will have 7 tomatoes left after today.;
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes initially. He picked 56 tomatoes yesterday, leaving him with 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes. Then, he picked another 41 tomatoes today, leaving him with 104 - 41 = 63 tomatoes. So, the farmer has 63 tomatoes left after yesterday's picking.;
Response:  The farmer picked 154 tomatoes yesterday + 50 tomatoes today = 204 tomatoes altogether. So, the farmer picked 204 tomatoes in total.;
Response:  The farmer initially had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes for a total of 252 (175 + 77). If he picked 172 potatoes, then he has 77 potatoes remaining. To find out how many tomatoes he has left, we can subtract the number of tomatoes he picked from the initial amount: 175 - 172 = 3. So, the farmer now has 3 tomatoes left in his garden.;
Response:  The farmer initially had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes. If he picks 53 tomatoes, then the number of tomatoes he has left is 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes. Similarly, the number of potatoes he has left after picking 53 tomatoes is 12 - 0 = 12 potatoes. Therefore, the farmer now has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden.;
Response:  The total number of tomatoes the farmer has is 105 + 71 = 176 tomatoes. If he picks 137 tomatoes, then the number of tomatoes left after picking would be 176 - 137 = 39 tomatoes. So, there are 39 tomatoes left in the garden after the farmer picks 137 tomatoes.;
Response:  John will require four nails to secure the walls of the house using large planks of wood. Each plank requires two nails to be secured. Therefore, to determine the number of planks needed, we can divide the total number of nails required (four) by the number of nails required per plank (two). So, John needs 4/2 = 2 planks of wood for each wall. Since there are four walls in the house, John needs a total of 4 x 2 = 8 planks of wood for the entire house.;
Response:  John will utilize 13 big boards of timber for the walls of his home. Each board requires 17 nails to secure it. So, John needs 249 nails (13 x 17 = 249). Yet, there are eight additional small boards that require eight more nails. Therefore, John needs a total of 257 nails (249 + 8) for the house walls.;
Response:  John will require 3 pieces of nails per plank, so he will need 3 x number of planks = 3n planks. Additionally, there are 8 extra nails used, which means that 8/3 = 2.67 planks can be made using these extra nails (since you cannot make half a plank). So, the total number of planks needed is 3 + 2.67 = 5.67 planks.;
Response:  Large planks require 15 nails each, while small planks require 5 nails each. So John needs 15 x 3 = 45 nails for the large planks and 5 x 10 = 50 nails for the small planks. Therefore, in total, John needs 45 + 50 = 95 nails for the house walls.;
Response:  John will require 2 nails per plank (as stated in the problem). Since there are 16 planks required for the house walls, John will need 16 x 2 = 32 nails altogether. Therefore, John requires 32 nails for the house walls.;
Response:  John wants to secure 8 large planks of wood for the house walls using 74 pieces of nails per plank. Therefore, we can calculate the number of planks needed as follows: Number of planks = Total number of pieces of nails / Number of nails required per plank To find out the total number of pieces of nails, we are given that there are 8 large planks of wood. So, the total number of pieces of nails is: Total number of pieces of nails = 8 x 74 = 592 Now, let's divide the total number of pieces of nails by the number of nails required per plank to find out the number of planks needed: Number of planks = 592 / 74 = 8 Therefore, John needs 8 large planks of wood for the house walls.;
Response:  John wants to utilize 12 big boards and 17 little boards for the house walls. Each significant board requires 14 nails to secure it, while each minor board calls for 25 nails. To determine how many boards John needs for the house walls, we must multiply the number of major boards by the quantity of nails required per board (14) and then add that amount to the total number of smaller boards multiplied by the same value (25). So, John will require: Major boards x Nails/board = 12 x 14 = 168 Small boards x Nails/board = 17 x 25 = 425 Total = 168 + 425 = 593 boards. Therefore, John needs 593 boards for the house walls.;
"Response:  We know that Robin has a total number of 42 pieces of gum. If we divide this number by the number of pieces per package (which is 3), we get the total number of packages as follows:

Number of pieces of gum = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per package
= 42 / 3
= 14
Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum.";
Response:  Robin has 43 packages of gum, and each package contains 23 pieces of gum. Therefore, Robin has a total of 43 x 23 = 997 pieces of gum. Additionally, Robinson has 8 extra pieces of gum, so he has a total of 997 + 8 = 1005 pieces of gum.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 41 pieces of gum altogether. If he had x packages of gum, then we can write an equation based on this information: 41 = x + 7x (since he has 7 pieces of gum per package). Simplifying the equation gives us: 41 = 8x. Dividing both sides by 8 gives us: 5 = x. So, Robin has 5 packages of gum.;
Response:  Robin has 28 packages of gum, which means he has 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum altogether. So, Robin has 112 pieces of gum.;
Response:  Robin has 21 packages of gum, which means he has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. Now, he also has 45 packages of candy, which means he has 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy. Therefore, Robin has a total of 189 + 405 = 594 pieces of candy.;
Response:  Robin has 28 packages of gum, which means he has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gum. Similarly, he has 14 packages of candy, which means he has 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy. Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of candy.;
Response:  The machine produced 6 shirts altogether. If one shirt takes 1 minute to produce, then the total time taken to manufacture all six shirts is 6 minutes. So, the machine worked for 6 minutes.;
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes and can produce 4 shirts per minute. So, in total, the machine produced = Number of minutes x Number of shirts/minute. In this case, we have 5 minutes x 4 shirts/minute = 20 shirts. Therefore, the machine made 20 shirts during those 5 minutes.;
"Response:  The machine produced 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today. So, we need to find out how long the machine worked in total. We know that the machine makes 3 shirts per minute, so...

Step-by-step solution:

1. Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in x minutes = 9/3 = 3 minutes.
2. Today, the machine made 44 shirts in y minutes = 44/3 = 14 minutes.
3. Total time the machine worked = 3 + 14 = 17 minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for 17 minutes yesterday.";
Response:  The machine produced 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today. So, altogether, the machine worked for (yesterday + today) = 13 + 3 = 16 minutes.;
Response:  The machine produced 8 shirts today, so in one day (yesterday + today), it produced 9 + 8 = 17 shirts. Since the machine can produce 2 shirts per minute, it worked for 17 / 2 = 8.5 minutes today. So, the machine worked for approximately 8.5 minutes today.;
Response:  The machine produced 4 shirts per minute yesterday and 8 shirts per minute today. So, to find out how many minutes the machine worked overall, we need to multiply the number of shirts produced each day by the time taken to produce one shirt. Therefore, the total minutes the machine worked are: Total minutes = (Number of shirts produced yesterday x Time taken to produce 1 shirt) + (Number of shirts produced today x Time taken to produce 1 shirt)  Total minutes = (4 x 60) + (8 x 60) Total minutes = 240 + 480 Total minutes = 720 minutes  Therefore, the machine worked for 720 minutes in all.;
Response:  The machine made 6 shirts per minute, so in 12 minutes, it produced 72 shirts (12 x 6 = 72). And today, it made 14 shirts in 14 minutes, which is equal to 98 shirts (14 x 6 = 84 + 14 = 98). Therefore, the total number of shirts that the machine made is 72 + 98 = 170 shirts.;
Response:  The machine made 12 shirts today. We know that in one minute, the machine can produce 6 shirts. So, to find out how many shirts the machine produced today, we need to divide the number of shirts produced today (12) by the time taken to produce those shirts (in minutes): 12 / 5 = 2.4. Therefore, the machine made 2.4 shirts today.;
Response:  The carnival made $165 in five days. To find out how much it made per day, we can divide that number by five: $$ \boxed {165} / 5 = 33 }$$ So, the carnival made $33 per day.;
"Response:  The amount of money earned from the ring toss game is given as $144 per day. To find out how much money was made in total, we need to multiply this value by the number of days they were at the carnival. So, if they were there for 22 days, then the total amount of money earned would be:

$144/day x 22 days = $3,068

Therefore, the carnival made $3,068 during their stay.";
Response:  The ring toss game brought in $420 over 30 days and added $22 more from other sources. To determine how much it generated daily, divide this sum by the number of days: $$ \frac {420}{30} = 14$$ So, the ring toss game produced around $14 every day.;
"Response:  The total number of days was 54 days (first 44 + last 10). So, we can calculate the daily earnings as follows:
First 44 days: $382 x 44 = $16,396
Last 10 days: $374 x 10 = $3,740
Total earnings = Daily earnings x Number of days = $16,396 + $3,740 = $20,136
Therefore, the ring toss game at the carnival made a total of $20,136 during its entire duration.";
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the entire period is $186 ($120 + $66). To find out how much was earned each day, we can divide this total amount by the number of days the game was open for business: $186 / 36 = $5.25 per day. So, during the first 20 days of the carnival, the ring toss game made an average of $5.25 per day.;
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the entire period was $325 + $114 = $439. To find out how much they made each day in the last 57 days, we can divide this total amount by the number of days left: $439 / 57 = $7.80. So, they made approximately $7.80 per day in the remaining 57 days at the carnival.;
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cake, then the total number of packs she bought is 10 + 4 = 14. Since we know that there are more packs of cookies than cake, this means that Lucy bought more packs of cookies than cake. So, the difference between the number of packs of cookies and cake is equal to the number of packs of cookies minus the number of packs of cake. In other words, the difference is 14 - 4 = 10. Therefore, Lucy bought 10 more packs of cookies than cake.;
Response:  Lucy bought 4 packs of cookies, which means she bought 4 x 22 = 88 packets of cookies. She also bought 20 packs of cake (22 x 20 = 440 packets), and 16 packs of chocolate (16 x 16 = 256 packets). Therefore, Lucy bought a total of 88 + 440 + 256 = 784 packs of groceries altogether.;
Response:  According to the question, Lucy purchased 23 packets of cookies and an unknown number of packages of cake at the supermarket. To determine how many bags of cake Lucy acquired overall, we must divide the total quantity of groceries (27) by the number of packages of cookies (23). This gives us approximately 1.16 packages of cake per bag. Therefore, Lucy purchased roughly 11-12 packages of cake altogether. ;
Response:  Lucy purchased two packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes. To find out how many total packs of groceries she bought, we need to multiply the number of each item she bought. So, the total number of packs of groceries Lucy bought is: 2 x 12 = 24 packs of groceries. Therefore, Lucy bought 24 packs of groceries in all.;
Response:  The initial number of passengers on the bus was 12. Then, 4 additional passengers boarded the bus at the subsequent stop, bringing the total to 12 + 4 = 16. Since no bus may carry over 36 individuals, we know that this is the current number of passengers aboard the vehicle. Therefore, there are currently 16 people on the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were eight individuals on the bus. Then, twelve additional passengers boarded the vehicle after it stopped again. So, the total number of passengers currently aboard is (8 + 12) = 20. Finally, three riders left the bus, reducing its current population to twenty minus three = seventeen. Therefore, there are seventeen people on the bus right now.;
Response:  At first, there were 4 individuals on the bus. Then, 13 additional passengers boarded the vehicle. So, the total number of persons currently aboard is: 4 + 13 = 17. Therefore, there are seventeen people on the bus right now.;
Response:  At first, there were 11 individuals on the train. Then, eight additional passengers boarded the train, bringing the total number of travelers to 19 (11 + 8). Therefore, currently, there are 19 people aboard the train.;
Response:  We know that there are 22 parents involved in the program. Each parent has brought at least one child with them to the program. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of children is equal to or greater than the number of parents. So, the number of pupils present in the program = Number of parents x Minimum number of children per parent  = 22 x 1 = 22 Thus, there were 22 pupils present in the program.;
Response:  The number of parents = 73. The number of students = 724. And the number of teachers = 744. So, the total number of individuals present at the program is equal to the sum of these numbers: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531. Therefore, there were 1531 people present in the program.;
Response:  The number of parents in the program is 174, while the number of students is 521. To determine how many more students are enrolled than parents, we must subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants (students + parents). Therefore, the difference between the number of students and parents is:  521 - 174 = 347. So, there are 347 more students than parents in the program.;
"Response:  The number of parents = 61. The number of students = 177. The maximum capacity of the hall is 44. So, we need to find out how many parents and students are attending the program together. We can do this by dividing the total number of attendees (parents + students) by the maximum capacity of the hall.

Total number of attendees = Number of parents + Number of students
= 61 + 177
= 238

Since the maximum capacity of the hall is 44, we know that the number of attendees cannot exceed this value. Therefore, we can conclude that there are at most 44 people present in the program.";
Response:  The distance from the entrance to the point where they need to go is given as $1307$ feet. To find out how far the end of the cave is, we must subtract the depth of the cave ($919$ feet) from this total distance : $$ Distance = 1307 - 919 = 388 \text{ feet} $$ Therefore, the end of the cave is $388$ feet away from the entrance.;
"Response:  The distance from their current location to the bottom of the cave is given as $849$ feet. To find out how far they have left to go until reaching the end of the cave, we need to subtract this distance from their current depth level:

$$ Distance = Depth - 849 $$

Given that they are traveling at a speed of $17$ feet per minute, we can calculate the time it takes them to reach the end of the cave using the formula:

$$ Time = Distance / Speed $$

Substituting the values we know into this equation, we get:

$$ Time = (Depth - 849) / 17 $$

Simplifying and solving for $Time$, we get:

$$ Time = \frac{(Depth - 849)}{17} $$

Now, we are told that the cave is $1218$ feet deep. Substituting this value into our previous equation, we get:

$$ Time = \frac{1218}{17} = 73 minutes $$

Therefore, it will take them approximately $73$ minutes to reach the end of the cave if they continue traveling at a speed of $17$ feet per minute.";
Response:  If they have reached 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet deep, that means there are still 103 feet to go before reaching the bottom of the cave. So, they will need to travel an additional 103 feet to reach the end of the cave.;
Response:  Paige had 8 goldfish initially and then lost 6 of them due to stray cats eating them. So, the final number of goldfish left is 8 - 6 = 2.;
"Response:  We know that Paige had 7 goldfish initially. The number of catfish was 12. Now, we are told that stray cats loved to eat them, so some of the fish disappeared. To find out how many fish disappeared, we need to subtract the remaining fish from the initial total. So, the answer is:

Number of fish that disappeared = Number of fish left - Initial number of fish
= 15 - 7
= 8

Therefore, 8 fish disappeared due to the stray cats.";
"Response:  We know that Paige had 16 goldfish initially. The number of catfish was not mentioned in the question. Now, we are told that only two goldfish remain after the stray cats ate most of them. So, to find out how many goldfish disappeared, we need to subtract the remaining fish from the initial number of goldfish. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of goldfish that disappeared = 16 - 2 = 14

So, 14 goldfish disappeared due to the stray cats eating them.";
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish in the pond initially and that 5 of them were eaten by stray cats. So, the number of goldfish remaining is equal to the initial amount minus the number eaten. In other words, we can write it as follows: Number of goldfish remaining = Initial quantity - Number eaten Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of goldfish remaining = 15 - 5 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 goldfish remaining in the pond after 5 were eaten by stray cats.;
Response:  The chef started with 43 apples and used them to make pies. After that, he had 2 apples remaining. So, the number of apples he used is equal to 43 - 2 = 41 apples.;
Response:  The chef started with 58 apples and made some pies using 35 of them. So, the number of apples remaining is equal to 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 apples left.;
Response:  The total number of fruits = Number of Apples + Number of Peaches = 40 + 54 = 94. Now, if he made pies using these fruits and had 39 left, then the number of fruits used to make the pies is equal to the number of fruits remaining after making the pies. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Fruits Used = Number of Fruits Remaining - Number of Pies Made = 94 - 39 = 55. Therefore, the chef used 55 apples to make the pies.;
Response:  Adam can fit 11 action figures on each of the four shelves in his room, so he can accommodate a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures on all four shelves combined. However, there are also 40 cabinets in the room that Adam cannot use for storing action figures. Therefore, the total number of action figures that Adam's room can hold is 44 + 40 = 84 action figures.;
Response:  Adam can fit 10 action figures on each shelf of his room. So if he can fit 10 action figures per shelf and there are 8 action figures that can be held in his room, then we need to divide 8 by 10 to get the number of shelves in his room. Therefore, Adam's room had 8/10 = 4 shelves.;
Response:  Adam can fit 8 action figures on each of the four shelves he has in his room. Therefore, the total number of action figures that can be placed on all four shelves is 8 x 4 = 32 action figures. Similarly, Adam can place ten cabinets on each of the four shelves, so the total number of cabinets that can be placed on all four shelves is 10 x 4 = 40 cabinets. In conclusion, Adam's shelves have a capacity to hold 32 action figures and 40 cabinets for a combined total of 72 things.;
Response:  There are 10 gardens with 544 pots in each garden. So, the total number of pots is 10 x 544 = 5440 pots. Since each pot contains 32 flowers, the total number of flowers is 5440 x 32 = 176,800 flowers. Therefore, there are 176,800 flowers in all.;
Response:  We know that there are 466 pots of flowers. Each pot contains 53 flowers, so we have 466 x 53 = 24,978 flowers altogether. Similarly, each pot contains 181 sticks, so we have 466 x 181 = 85,066 sticks altogether. Therefore, there are 24,978 + 85,066 = 109,044 flowers and sticks in total.;
Response:  There are 141 pots of flowers altogether. Each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 sticks. So, if we multiply the number of pots with the number of flowers per pot, we get: Number of flowers = Total number of pots x Number of flowers per pot = 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. Therefore, there are 9671 flowers in total.;
Response:  If there are 40 flowers in each pot and 400 flowers in total, then we can divide both numbers to find out how many pots there are: 400 / 40 = 10 (pots). Therefore, there are 10 pots in all.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 4502 Skittles in his collection and 4276 erasers. To organize them into 154 groups means we have to divide both quantities equally among those groups. So, we can calculate the number of items per group as follows: Number of items per group = Total number of items / Number of groups = 4502 Skittles + 4276 erasers / 154 groups = 38.9 Skittles or erasers per group. Therefore, each group contains approximately 39 Skittles or erasers.;
"Response:  We know that Steven has 3941 Skittles and 4950 erasers. If we divide the number of erasers by the number of groups he wants to organize them in (495), then we get the size of each group. So, the size of each group is:

3941 / 495 = 7

Therefore, each group contains 7 erasers.";
"Response:  We know that Steven has 896 Skittles in his collection. If he organizes them into 8 groups, then we can assume that each group will contain an equal number of Skittles (since he wants to keep things fair). So, let x be the number of Skittles in each group. Then, we have:

Number of Skittles = 896
Number of Groups = 8

Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies these two equations simultaneously. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's choose the latter approach here.

Eliminate the variable x from the system of equations using multiplication:

For the first equation, multiply both sides by 8:

8x = 896

For the second equation, multiply both sides by 2:

2x + 517 = 90(2)

Now, solve for x:

2x + 517 = 1824

Subtracting 517 from both sides gives us:

2x = 1307

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 653

So, each group contains 653 Skittles.";
"Response:  If there are 270 students in the school, then there will be 5 students per grade x Total Number Of Grades = Total Number Of Students In All The Grades. 
So, we can write this as follows: 5(x) = 270 where ""x"" represents the total number of grades. Now, solving for ""x"", we get x = 270 / 5 = 54. Therefore, there are 54 grades in the school.";
"Response:  The number of grades is given as 304. Each grade has 75 students, so we can write this as: 304 x 75 = Total Number Of Students. To solve for the unknown variable ""Total Number Of Students,"" multiply 304 by 75: 304 x 75 = 22,550 Total Number Of Students. Therefore, there are 22,550 students in total at the school.";
