Response:  On Monday (lunedì), Julia played tag with 18 kids.  On Tuesday (martedì), she played tag with 10 kids. To find out how many more kids Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Tuesday from the number of kids she played with on Monday:  18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, Julia played tag with 8 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (lunedì), Julia played tag with 11 kids.  On Tuesday (martedì), she played tag with 12 kids. So, we can say that Julia played tag with more kids on Tuesday than on Monday. In particular, she played with 12 - 11 = 1 additional kid on Tuesday compared to Monday.
Response:  Julia played with 5 kids on Monday and then she played with other kids on Tuesday. So, in total, she played with 10 kids (5 + 5). Therefore, Julia played with 10 kids on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played tag with some kids on Monday and then she played with 14 more kids on Tuesday. So, in total, Julia played tag with 16 children (Monday + Tuesday). Therefore, Julia played tag with 4 kids on Monday.
Response:  Julia played tag with 16 kids on Monday and then she played with 12 more kids on Tuesday. So, if we add both numbers together, Julia played tag with a total of 28 kids (16 + 12).
Response:  Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday and then she played with 8 more kids on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with 22 kids (14 + 8).
Response:  Monday - 17 children played tag together with Julia. Tuesday - 15 children played tag with Julia. Wednesday - 2 children played tag with Julia. Therefore, in total, Julia has played tag with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  Julia has played tag with 15 children on Monday, 18 children on Tuesday, and 97 children on Wednesday. So, she has played with a total of 15 + 18 = 33 children on Monday and Tuesday combined. Therefore, Julia has played with 33 children on Monday and Tuesday.
Response:  Julia has played tag with 5 children on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So, she must have played with at least 3 different groups of children. Therefore, we can say that Julia has played tag with 3 x 5 = 15 children in total.
Response:  Monday (14) + Tuesday (0) + Wednesday (16) = 30. So, Julia played with 30 children in total.
Response:  Julia has played tag with 9 children on Monday, 7 children on Tuesday, and 96 children on Wednesday. So, in total, she has played with 9 + 7 = 16 children on non-Wednesdays (Monday and Tuesday). Therefore, she has played with 96 - 16 = 80 children on Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played tag with 14 children on Monday, 2 children on Tuesday, and 8 children on Wednesday. So, in total, she played tag with 14 + 2 = 16 children on days other than Wednesday. Now, we need to find out how many children she played with on Wednesday. According to the question, she played tag with 8 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of children she played with on Wednesday is 8. Subtracting this number from the total number of children she played with on days other than Wednesday gives us the number of children she played with on Monday: 16 - 8 = 8. So, Julia played tag with 8 children on Monday.
Response:  Julia played tag with 8 children on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. So, she played with 3 different groups of children. Therefore, the number of children she played with on Martedì is equal to the number of children she did not play with on Mercoledì. Since we know that Julia played with 8 children on Monday, we can conclude that she did not play with any children on Tuesday (since there are no other days mentioned in the question). Now, let's count the number of children Julia played with on Wednesday:  Julia played with 9 children on Wednesday, so she played with 9 - 8 = 1 more child than she played with on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played with 1 child less than she played with on Wednesday. So, the number of children Julia played with on Martedì is equal to 1.  Thus, Julia played with 1 child on Martedì.
Response:  Julia played tag with 15 children on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. So, she played with 15 + 15 + 7 = 37 children in total. Therefore, Julia played tag with 37 - 15 - 15 = 17 other children on Monday and Tuesday compared to Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Julia played with 13 children each day = 26 children. On Wednesday, she played cards with 15 teenagers = 15 children. In total, Julia has played with 26 + 15 = 41 children.
Response:  Julia played tag with 7 children on Monday and 13 children on Tuesday. So far, she has played tag with 7 + 13 = 20 children. However, the question states that she also played cards with 20 boys on Wednesday. Therefore, we can conclude that Julia did not play tag with any more children after Wednesday. Hence, the number of children she played tag with is 20.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 12 kids for 7 hours (since she said she played from 9 am to 5 pm). So, she spent 7 x 12 = 84 hours playing with those kids. Then, on Tuesday, she played with 14 kids for 6 hours (from 9 am to 3 pm). Therefore, she spent 6 x 14 = 84 hours playing with them too! In total, Julia spent 84 + 84 = 168 hours playing tag with both groups of kids. Since there are 24 hours in a day, that means she spent half of her time playing tag - 168 / 2 = 84 hours. So, Julia played tag with 84 kids in total.
Response:  On Monday (lunedì), Julia played with 19 kids. On Tuesday (martedì), she played with 18 kids. So, the difference between the number of kids she played with on Monday and the number of kids she played with on Tuesday is:  19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with 1 more kid on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Tuesday (martedì), Julia played tag with 5 boys.  On Monday (lunedì), she played tag with 6 boys. So, in total, Julia played tag with 11 boys (5 + 6).
Response:  Julia played with 18 kids in total and she played with 4 kids on Monday (lunedì). So, the number of kids she played with on Tuesday is:  Number of kids she played with on Tuesday = Total number of kids - Number of kids she played with on Monday  = 18 - 4  = 14 Therefore, Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday (martedì).
Response:  On Monday (Lunedì), Julia played with 6 children. On Tuesday (Martedì), she played with 17 children. So, if we subtract the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday, we get:  6 - 17 = -11. Therefore, Julia played with -11 children fewer on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  If Bobby has eaten $3$ candies initially and then he has eaten $\boxed{25}$ more candies, then the total number of candies he has eaten is:
$$\text {Total} = \text {Initial} + \text {Additional} = 3 + 25 = 28$$
So, Bobby has eaten $28$ candies in total."
Response:  Bobby has eaten 28 caramelles initially and then he has eaten other 42 caramelles. So in total, Bobby has eaten 28 + 42 = 70 caramelles.
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 33 caramelles and then he ate 4 more. So, in total, Bobby has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 caramelles. Additionally, he has also eaten 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the final answer is:  Bobby has eaten 37 caramels and 14 pieces of chocolate.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 38 gummies initially and then he has eaten another 36 gummies. So far, Bobby has eaten a total of 74 gummies (38 + 36). Now, we are told that Bobby has also eaten 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby has eaten is 74 + 16 = 90.  So, Bobby has eaten 90 sweets in total.
Response:  Bobby has taken 20 candies and eaten 34 of them. So he has left with 20 - 34 = -14 candies. Then, he has eaten another 18 candies. Therefore, in total, Bobby has eaten 18 + (-14) = 3 candies.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 21 candies initially. Then he has eaten 5 more candies, so now he has 26 candies (21 + 5). Finally, he has eaten another 9 candies, so now he has 35 candies left (26 - 9 = 35). Therefore, there are 35 candies remaining for Bobby.
Response:  At first, Bobby had eaten 22 caramelles. Then he ate some more sweets and ate 5 more caramels. So, at this point, Bobby has eaten a total of 22 + 5 = 27 caramels. Therefore, he still has 8 - 27 = -19 caramels left.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 19 candies initially. If he has eaten two candies so far, then he has left 17 candies (19 - 2 = 17). So, there are 17 candies remaining for him to eat.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 32 caramelles and he has eaten some sweets, then he must have eaten at least 4 caramels (since 32 - 4 = 28). So, if he has eaten 4 caramels, then he has 28 remaining. Therefore, Bobby has eaten 4 caramels.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 caramels and he ate 17 of them. So, he has left 36 - 17 = 19 caramels. Then, he eats another 15 caramels, so he is left with 19 - 15 = 4 caramels. Therefore, Bobby has 4 caramelles remaining.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 30 caramels and he ate 23 of them. So, how many caramels does he have left? We can write an equation using the information given in the question: Number of caramels Bobby has = Initial number of caramels - Number of caramels eaten. In this case, the initial number of caramels is 30, and Bobby ate 23, so we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the remaining number of caramels: Number of caramels Bobby has = 30 - 23 = 7. Therefore, Bobby has 7 caramels left.
Response:  We know that Allan had 5 palloncini and Jake had 3 palloncini before they went to the park. So, if we add these numbers together, we get: 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, Allan had 8 palloncini more than Jake at the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons at the park. So, if we add these numbers together, we get: 2 + 3 = 5. Therefore, Jake had 5 balloons more than Allan at the park.
Response:  If Allan has brought 2 balloons to the park and Jake has brought 1 balloon, then together they have brought 3 balloons to the park (the total number of balloons). So, Jake has brought 3 - 2 = 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  If Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park and he has more than Allen who brought 4 balloons, then we can say that Allen brought fewer balloons than Jake. So, Allen brought 2 less balloons than Jake (6 - 4 = 2). Therefore, Allen brought 2 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan has brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake has brought 6 more than the number of balloons that Allan brought, then Jake must have brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Allan had 3 balloons and Jake had 5 balloons initially. Then, Allan bought 2 more balloons at the park. So, in total, Allan had 3 + 2 = 5 balloons at the park. Similarly, Jake also bought 2 more balloons at the park, so he had 5 + 2 = 7 balloons at the park. Therefore, Allan had 5 balloons and Jake had 7 balloons at the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 palloncini initially and then he bought 3 more at the park. So, Allan had 5 palloncini (2 + 3) in total. Now, Jake had 4 palloncini initially plus he brought 4 more to the park. Therefore, Jake had 8 palloncini (4 + 4) in total. To find out how many more palloncini Allan had than Jake, we need to subtract the number of palloncini that Jake had from the number of palloncini that Allan had: 5 - 8 = -3. So, Allan had 3 fewer palloncini than Jake at the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 balloons and Jake had 6 balloons at first. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons. So, Allan now has 5 balloons (2 + 3). Jake still has 6 balloons. Therefore, Jake has 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  Allan had initially brought 5 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more at the park. So, in total, Allan has brought 8 balloons (5 + 3) to the park. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 2 balloons initially. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, the total number of balloons that Jake had is 2 + 3 = 5. Now, we need to find out how many balloons Allan had in excess of Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of balloons that Jake had from the total number of balloons carried by Allan: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Allan had 1 extra balloon than Jake at the park.
Response:  Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons initially. Then, Jake bought 4 more balloons at the park. So, Jake now has 3 + 4 = 7 balloons more than Allan. Therefore, Jake had 7 - 6 = 1 more balloon than Allan at the park.
Response:  Allan has brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake has brought 6 balloons plus he bought 3 more at the park. So, in total, Jake has brought 6 + 3 = 9 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan had 3 palloncini and 20 palle when he went to the park. So, in total, Allan had 3 + 20 = 23 objects at the park.  Similarly, we know that Jake had 5 palloncini and 59 palle when he went to the park. So, in total, Jake had 5 + 59 = 64 objects at the park. Therefore, the number of palloncini and palle that Allan and Jake had at the park are:  Allan - 23 palloncini and 20 palle.  Jake - 64 palloncini and 59 palle.
Response:  We know that Allan has brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park. So, he has (7 + 5) = 12 objects in total. Similarly, we know that Jake has brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park. Therefore, he has (6 + 4) = 10 objects in total. Now, let's compare the number of objects each person has brought to the park:  Allan has 12 objects, while Jake has 10 objects. So, Allan has more objects than Jake at the park. In particular, Allan has 2 more balloons and 1 more ball than Jake.
Response:  If Allan has brought 5 balloons and Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park, then we can say that Jake has brought 1 more balloon than Allan. So, Jake has brought 5 + 1 = 6 balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan has brought 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more, he now has a total of 5 balloons at the park (2 + 3 = 5).  If Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park, then Jake has more balloons than Allan at the park (6 > 5). Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent learning Chinese from the total time spent learning both languages. So, let's do that:
Total time spent learning both languages = Time spent learning English + Time spent learning Chinese
= 6 hours/day + 2 hours/day
= 8 hours/day
Now, let's find out how many more hours Ryan spends learning English than Chinese:
More hours spent learning English - More hours spent learning Chinese
= 8 hours/day - 2 hours/day
= 6 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 6 hours more per day learning English than he does learning Chinese."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. So he learns English for 6 hours + 7 hours = 13 hours per day. Therefore, he learns Chinese for 7 hours - 13 hours = -6 hours less than English every day.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some other time learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 hours per day learning both languages combined. So, if he learns English for x hours per day, he must learn Chinese for 4 - x hours per day. Since he spends a total of 4 hours per day learning both languages, we can set up the equation:

x + (4 - x) = 4...(1)

Now, we need to solve for x. We know that x is the number of hours Ryan spends learning English per day. Substituting this value into equation (1), we get:

3 + (4 - 3) = 4...(2)

Simplifying equation (2), we get:

5 = 4...(3)

Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and some other time learning Chinese, then he spends x hours per day learning Chinese. Since he spends 2 more hours per day learning English than he does learning Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:

x + 2 = 7... (1)

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 7 - 2... (2)

Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and some other time learning English, then he spends x hours per day learning English. Since he spends 2 hours more than he does learning Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5 + 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 7 hours learning Chinese every day, then he will spend a total of:

6 x 21 = 132 hours learning English in one week (assuming he learns for 5 days)
7 x 21 = 147 hours learning Chinese in one week (assuming he learns for 5 days)

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 132 + 147 = 289 hours learning both English and Chinese in one week."
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day and 5 hours learning Chinese every day, then in total he spends 6 + 5 = 11 hours studying each day.  Since he studies for 2 days, he spends a total of 11 x 2 = 22 hours studying English.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours learning English every day and 4 hours learning Chinese every day for 6 days, then he will have spent a total of:

English = 5 x 6 = 30 hours
Chinese = 4 x 6 = 24 hours
So, in total, Ryan has learned 30 hours of English and 24 hours of Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 6 hours learning Chinese every day for 86 days, then he will have spent in total:

English = 4 h/d x 86 d = 324 hours learning English
Chinese = 6 h/d x 86 d = 504 hours learning Chinese
So, Ryan spends approximately 324 hours learning English and 504 hours learning Chinese each day."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day. He also spends 3 hours per day learning Spanish. So, in total, Ryan learns English, Chinese, and Spanish for 13 + 7 + 3 = 23 hours per day.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 3 hours per day learning Chinese, and 58 hours per week learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Chinese, we need to calculate the difference between these two amounts. So, let's do that:

Hours spent learning English - Hours spent learning Chinese = 6 hours/day - 3 hours/day = 3 hours/day

Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours more per day learning English than he does learning Chinese."
"Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English, 2 hours per day learning Chinese, and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than he does Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning Spanish from the total number of hours he spends learning both languages. So, if we convert all the time units to hours (since the question asks for hours), we get:
Hours spent learning English = 7 x 24 = 168 hours/day
Hours spent learning Chinese = 2 x 24 = 48 hours/day
Hours spent learning Spanish = 4 x 24 = 96 hours/day
Total hours spent learning both languages = Hours spent learning English + Hours spent learning Chinese + Hours spent learning Spanish = 168 + 48 + 96 = 302 hours/day
Now, let's subtract the number of hours he spends learning Spanish from the total number of hours he spends learning both languages:
Number of hours he spends learning English more than Spanish = Total hours spent learning both languages - Hours spent learning Spanish = 302 - 96 = 206 hours/day
Therefore, Ryan passes an additional 206 hours per day learning English compared to what he learns in Spanish."
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese and 4 hours learning Spanish every day. So he learns Chinese for 5 + 2 = 7 hours per day and Spanish for 4 + 2 = 6 hours per day. Since we know that Ryan spends more time learning Chinese than Spanish, we can say that the difference between the number of hours he spends learning Chinese and Spanish is equal to the total number of hours he spends learning both languages. Therefore, the difference between 7 hours and 6 hours is equal to the total number of hours Ryan spends learning both languages, which is 13 hours (7 - 6). So, Ryan spends 13 hours learning Chinese and 6 hours learning Spanish each day.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spends x hours per day learning Chinese. Since he spends 2 hours per day learning English, we can write an equation as follows:

x + 2 = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese."
Response:  For English, he spends 4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours learning English.  For Chinese, he spends 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours learning Chinese. So, in total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours learning both languages.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 bags of cans. If she found 7 more bags of cans on Tuesday, then the total number of bags of cans that Tiffany collected on Monday and Tuesday is:  8 + 7 = 15 bags of cans. Therefore, Tiffany collected 7 more bags of cans on Tuesday than she did on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Lunedì), Tiffany collected 7 bags of cans for recycling. The next day (Martedì), she found additional 12 bags of cans. So, in total, Tiffany collected 7 + 12 = 19 bags of cans from Monday to Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 bags of cans. If she found other bags of cans on Tuesday, then she must have found at least 2 more bags (since there are only 5 days in the week). So, the total number of bags of cans that Tiffany found is 6.
Response:  On Monday (Lunedì), Tiffany had some bags of cans. Let's call that number x.  Then, on Tuesday (Martedì), she found 4 more bags of cans. So, the total number of bags of cans Tiffany collected is x + 4.  Therefore, the answer to the question is x = 4.
Response:  On Monday (Lunedì), Tiffany had 10 bags of cans. If she found 3 more bags of cans the next day (Martedì), then she had a total of 10 + 3 = 13 bags of cans. Similarly, if she found 7 more bags of cans the day after that (Mercoledì), then she had a total of 13 + 7 = 20 bags of cans. Therefore, Tiffany had 20 bags of cans in total.
Response:  On Monday (Lunedì), Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans for recycling.  The next day, she found 10 more bags of cans. So, after Monday, Tiffany had 8 + 10 = 18 bags of cans. Then, on the third day, she found 4 more bags of cans. Therefore, the total number of bags of cans that Tiffany found after Monday is 18 + 4 = 22 bags.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 3 bags of cans. Then, she found additional 7 bags of cans and 44 bags of bottles. So, the total number of bags of cans that Tiffany collected is:  3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red peaches and 16 green peaches in the trash can. To find out how many more red peaches there are than green peaches, we need to subtract the number of green peaches from the total number of peaches. So, the difference between the number of red peaches and green peaches is:

17 - 16 = 1

Therefore, there are one more red peach than green peach in the trash can."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red peaches and 11 green peaches in the trash can. To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the trash can, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches. So, the answer is:  Number of green peaches = Total number of peaches - Number of red peaches = 11 + 5 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 green peaches in addition to the 5 red peaches in the trash can.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red apples and some green ones in the trash can. If there are 15 apples in total in the trash can, then we can say that the number of green apples is equal to 15 - 10 = 5. So, there are 5 green apples in the trash can.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red apples and some green ones in the trash can. If there are 10 more green apples than red apples in the trash can, then we can say that there are 10 + 3 = 13 green apples in the trash can. Therefore, there are 13 green apples in the trash can.
Response:  We have 7 red peaches and 15 yellow peaches in the trash can. If we add these numbers together, we get 22 peaches in total. So, there are 22 peaches in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red peaches, 71 yellow peaches, and 8 green peaches in the trash can. To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the trash can, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches. So, let's do this: Number of green peaches = Total number of peaches - Number of red peaches = 8 + 71 - 7 = 50 Therefore, there are 50 green peaches in addition to the 7 red peaches already in the trash can.
Response:  We have 2 red peaches and 6 yellow peaches in the trash can. To find out how many more green peaches there are than yellow peaches, we need to subtract the number of yellow peaches from the total number of peaches. So, if we have 2 red peaches and 6 yellow peaches, that means we have 2 + 6 = 8 peaches in total. Now, let's compare the number of green peaches with the number of yellow peaches. If we have 14 green peaches, then we have 14 - 6 = 8 more green peaches than yellow peaches. Therefore, there are 8 more green peaches than yellow peaches in the trash can.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red peaches and 11 yellow peaches in the basket. To find out how many more red peaches than yellow peaches there are, we need to subtract the number of yellow peaches from the total number of peaches: 19 - 11 = 8. So, there are 8 more red peaches than yellow peaches in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red peaches and 16 green peaches in the trash can. So, if we subtract the number of green peaches from the total number of peaches, we will get the number of red peaches in the trash can. Therefore, the number of red peaches in the trash can is 6 - 16 = -10. Since negative numbers cannot be used to represent quantities, let's round up the answer to zero (0) peaches. So, there are no red peaches in the trash can. Similarly, since there are no red peaches, there are also no green peaches in the trash can. Thus, the answer to the question is 0 peaches.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples in the trash can and 14 yellow ones. So, if we subtract the number of yellow apples from the total number of apples, we will get the number of red apples left in the trash can. Therefore, the number of red apples in the trash can is 18 - 14 = 4. Similarly, since there are no green apples mentioned in the question, we can assume that all the remaining apples are either red or yellow. So, the number of yellow apples in the trash can is also 14. Thus, the final answer is 4 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the trash can.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red peaches and 6 green peaches in the trash can. So, if we subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches, we will get the number of green peaches. Therefore, the number of green peaches is 6 - 5 = 1. And the number of yellow peaches is 0 because none were mentioned in the question.
Response:  We know that there are 65 baskets of peaches. Since each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches, we can write an equation as follows:  65 x 7 = 455 (red peaches) + 65 x 3 = 195 (green peaches) Total number of peaches = 455 + 195 = 650 peaches. Therefore, there are 650 peaches in every basket.
"Response:  We have 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So, we can write an equation:  
Red peaches = 10 x 11 = 110 Green peaches = 18 x 11 = 218 Total peaches = Red + Green = 110 + 218 = 328 Therefore, there are 328 peaches in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 baskets of peaches and each basket has 16 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So, we can write an equation as follows:  
Red peaches = 6 x 16 = 96 Green peaches = 6 x 18 = 108 Total number of peaches = Red + Green = 96 + 108 = 204 Therefore, there are 204 red peaches in total."
Response:  We know that there are 7 baskets of peaches and each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. So, we can write this as an equation:  7C + 2C = 10R + 2G Where C is the number of baskets, R is the number of red peaches, G is the number of green peaches, and D is the total number of peaches (red plus green). Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into the equation: 7C + 2C = 10(10) + 2(2) = 70 + 4 = 74 Therefore, there are 74 green peaches in all the baskets combined.
Response:  We know that there are 7 total peaches (4 red + 3 green). If we divide this number by the number of baskets (which is not given), we get the number of peaches in each basket. So, if there are x baskets, then each basket has 7/x peaches. Since we don't know the value of x, we can't determine how many baskets there are. Therefore, the answer is unknown.
Response:  Since there are two baskets of peaches and each basket has 4 red peaches and some green peaches, we can say that the total number of peaches is equal to 4 x 2 = 8. Now, since there are some green peaches among them, let's assume that the number of green peaches is x. Therefore, the total number of peaches in both baskets is 8 + x. We want to know how many green peaches are in each basket, so we divide the total number of peaches by 2: 8 + x = 16 / 2 = 8. So, there are 8 green peaches in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are 16 fish in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we subtract the number of red fish from the total number of fish, we will get the number of green fish. Therefore, the number of green fish is equal to 16 - 13 = 3.
Response:  We know that every basket of peaches has 19 red peaches and 4 green peaches. So, if we have 15 baskets of this type, the total number of peaches will be:  19 x 15 = 285 red peaches + 4 x 15 = 60 green peaches = 345 peaches in total.
Response:  We have 10 total peaches and we want to know how many baskets there are. Since each basket has an equal number of red and green peaches, let's assume that each basket contains 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. Therefore, if we divide 10 by 2 (the number of colors), we get 5 baskets. So, there are 5 baskets of peaches.
"Response:  We have 6 green peaches and 2 red peaches in the trash can. To find out how many more green peaches there are than red peaches, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches. So, the answer is:

Number of green peaches = Total number of peaches - Number of red peaches
= 60 + 2
= 62
Therefore, there are 62 green peaches in addition to the 2 red peaches in the trash can."
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf. Then he added other action figures to the shelf. So, if there are now 8 action figures on the shelf in total, that means Jerry has added 4 + x action figures where x is the number of additional action figures he added. Therefore, the answer is 4 + x = 8.
Response:  Jerry had initially 3 action figures on his shelf = $3$. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf = $7$. So, in total, Jerry has $3 + 7 = 10$ action figures on his shelf now.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry had 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had initially 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are now 12 (5 + 9) objects on the shelf, including the action figures. Therefore, there are 12 - 5 = 7 additional action figures on the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on his shelf. Then he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, now there are 6 action figures in total (2 + 4 = 6). Now, let's count how many books Jerry has left after adding the new action figures. He had 10 books initially, and then he added 4 more action figures, which means he has 10 - 4 = 6 books left on his shelf. Therefore, there were 6 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on one shelf in his room. Then he added another 10 books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry had 8 + 10 = 18 books on the shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on one shelf in his room. Then he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, there are now 7 + 4 = 11 items on the shelf. Therefore, there are 11 action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Then he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, in total, there were 14 items (5 action figures + 2 books + 9 new books) on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 4 new ones and removed 5 old ones. So, after these operations, Jerry had 8 + 4 - 5 = 17 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 4 new ones and removed some old ones. So, if he has 6 action figures now, that means he has 3 + 4 = 7 new action figures on his shelf. Therefore, he must have removed 3 - 3 = 0 action figures from the shelf.  Hence, Jerry has not removed any action figures from the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf. Then he added some new ones and took away 10 old ones. So, if we subtract 10 from 7, we get  -3. Therefore, Jerry has added 3 new action figures to his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had initially 8 action figures on his shelf. Then he added two more and removed seven. So, after these operations, Jerry has 8 + 2 - 7 = 3 action figures left on his shelf. Therefore, Jerry had initially 8 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on the shelf. If we also consider that Jerry has 10 books on the shelf, then the total number of items (action figures and books) on the shelf is 16 + 10 = 26 items. Therefore, there are 26 action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures initially on his shelf. Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are now 5 action figures on Jerry's shelf (3 + 4 + 2 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf. Then he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, now there are 2 + 3 = 5 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the number of books plus the number of action figures is equal to 7 + 5 = 12. Thus, there were 12 items (books and action figures) on Jerry's shelf after he added the new action figures.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, other birds joined them. So, in total, we have 3 + x birds sitting on the fence, where x is the number of birds that joined later. Therefore, the answer is 3 + x = 6, which simplifies to x = 3. Hence, there are 3 additional birds that joined the initial 3 birds already sitting on the fence.
Response:  At first, there were 4 birds on the fence. Then, 4 more birds joined them. So, the total number of birds on the fence now is 4 + 4 = 8 birds. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 8 birds on the fence.
Response:  We have 4 birds (uccelli) and 46 crows (cicogne) already sitting on the fence. If six more birds join them, then we will have:  4 + 46 = 50 birds on the fence. So, there are 50 birds on the fence in total.
Response:  We have three birds and two crows initially sitting on the fence. Then five more birds join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds and 2 crows on the fence.
"Response:  We have:
Tre uccelli (3) + Quattro cicogne (4) = Sedici uccelli (16). So there are 16 birds on the fence."
Response:  We have 6 crows and 3 new birds that joined them. So, in total we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds on the fence. Therefore, there are 9 cicognes (or crows) on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 6 crows on the fence. Then, two more crows joined them. So, in total, we have:  Birds = 4 + 2 = 6 Crows = 6 + 2 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 crows on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and four crows initially sitting on the fence. Then, six more crows join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds and 6 + 6 = 12 crows on the fence. Therefore, there are 7 birds and 12 crows on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds and 3 crows sitting on the fence. Then, two more crows joined them. So, in total, we have:  6 x 1 = 6 birds + 2 x 1 = 2 crows = 8 creatures altogether. Therefore, there are 8 creatures (birds and crows) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 4 birds (uccelli) already sitting on the fence. Then, we are told that 3 crows joined them. So, now there are 4 + 3 = 7 birds on the fence. Finally, another 6 crows join them, making the total number of crows on the fence to be 7 + 6 = 13 crows. Therefore, there are 13 cicogne (crows) on the fence.
Response:  We have 6 birds already sitting on the fence. Then, we add 4 more birds and another 8 crows. So, in total, there are 10 birds (6 + 4 + 8) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 7 birds already sitting on the fence (3 + 4). Then, we add another 5 birds and 4 crows, so there are in total 12 birds on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  We have 3 birds already sitting on the fence. Then, we have another 2 birds and 6 cranes joining them. So, in total, there are 3 + 2 = 5 birds on the fence. And since each bird is accompanied by one crane, there are 5 x 1 = 5 cranes on the fence as well. Therefore, the final answer is 5 birds and 5 cranes on the fence.
Response:  We have five crows (cinque) and three birds (tre). Then four more birds join them, so we have a total of... (four times three is twelve, plus the original five is fifteen). Therefore, there are fifteen birds on the fence!
Response:  We know that there are initially 6 crows and then 3 more birds join them. So, in total, we have:  6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 9 crows on the fence.
"Response:  We have:
Tre uccelli were sitting on the fence. Other 6 crows and other 2 birds joined them. How many crows are on the fence?
We know that there are 6 crows joining the initial 3, so the total number of crows is:
6 + 3 = 9
Therefore, there are 9 crows on the fence."
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, there are 37 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
"Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:

80 - 37 = 43

So, the second chapter has 43 pages more than the first chapter."
Response:  We know that there are 60 pages in the first chapter and 93 pages in total. So, if we divide the number of pages in the book (93) by the number of chapters (2), we get the average number of pages per chapter:  $ \frac{93}{2} = 46.5$ pages. Since the second chapter has more than half of the total number of pages ($46.5 > 60$), it must have at least $60/2 = 30$ pages. Therefore, there are at least $30$ pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and we want to find out how many pages are in each chapter. Since the second chapter has 36 pages, we can say that the first chapter must have x pages, where x is equal to 67 minus 36 = 31. So, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book. So, the total number of pages = Number of pages in first chapter + Number of pages in second chapter + Number of pages in third chapter.  Now, let's calculate the number of pages in each chapter:  Chapter 1 has 66 pages, so its length is 66. Chapter 2 has 35 pages, so its length is 35. Chapter 3 has 24 pages, so its length is 24. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:  Total number of pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.  Hence, the book has 125 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter is 91 pages long and the second chapter is 23 pages long. Therefore, the difference between their lengths is:  91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, so it takes 35/3 = 11 pages to cover one third of the book. Since there are three chapters, each chapter covers one-third of the book. Therefore, the second chapter will have 18 pages / 3 = 6 pages more than the third chapter. So, the answer is 6 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages is equal to the sum of the pages of each chapter. Therefore, we can write: Pages = (Capitulo 1 x Number of pages) + (Capitolo 2 x Number of pages) + (Capitolo 3 x Number of pages)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Pages = (53 x ) + (75 x ) + (21 x )  Simplifying and solving for, we get: Pages = 186  So, the first chapter has 186 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  If a book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages, then the total number of pages in the book is:  31 x 61 = 1891 pages. So, the book has 1891 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has 23 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = x Number of pages in Chapter 2 = 23 - x Now, we are given that the first chapter is 10 pages long, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 10 Therefore, the number of pages in the first chapter is 10.
"Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 81 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:

Number of pages in first chapter = Number of pages in second chapter x Number of chapters
= 81 x 2
= 162 pages

Therefore, there are 162 pages in the second chapter."
Response:  We know that in total, 62 people went for a rowing session. In the morning, 39 people went for a rowing session. So, we can say that 39/62 = x/100, where x is the number of people who went for a rowing session in the morning. Now, we are asked to find out how many people went for a rowing session in the morning. Therefore, we need to solve for x. Solving the equation, we get x = 27. So, 27 people went for a rowing session in the morning.
Response:  We know that 52 people went to row in the morning and 61 people went to row in the afternoon. So, if we subtract the number of people who went to row in the morning from the total number of people who went to row, we get:  Number of people who went to row in the afternoon = Total number of people - Number of people who went to row in the morning  Number of people who went to row in the afternoon = 61 - 52 = 9 Therefore, 9 people went to row in the afternoon.
Response:  If 15 people went to kayaking in the morning, then there are 32 - 15 = 17 people who did not go kayaking in the morning. Therefore, the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon is equal to 32 - 17 = 15 people.
Response:  We know that some campers went fishing in the morning while others went in the afternoon. In total, 60 campers went fishing that day. So, if we divide the number of campers who went fishing in the morning by the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon, we get: Number of campers who went fishing in the morning = Total number of campers x Percentage of campers who went fishing in the morning / 100  Number of campers who went fishing in the morning = 60 x (Number of campers who went fishing in the morning / Total number of campers) / 100  Now, let's calculate the percentage of campers who went fishing in the morning: Number of campers who went fishing in the morning = 7 Number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon = 42  Therefore, the percentage of campers who went fishing in the morning is: Percentage of campers who went fishing in the morning = Number of campers who went fishing in the morning / Total number of campers x 100  Percentage of campers who went fishing in the morning = 7 / 60 x 100 = 11.67%  So, approximately 11.67% of the campers went fishing in the morning.
Response:  In total, there are 36 people who went fishing in the morning + 13 people who went fishing in the afternoon = 49 people who went fishing at night. So, the answer is 49.
"Response:  We know that 44 people went fishing in the morning, so we can write down ""44"" as our first number. Then, we are told that 39 people went fishing in the afternoon, so we can write down ""39"" as our second number. Finally, we are told that 31 people went fishing in the evening, so we can write down ""31"" as our third number. Therefore, the total number of people who went fishing in the morning is 44 + 39 = 83. So, the answer to the question is 83."
Response:  We know that 48 campers went to row in the afternoon and 49 campers went to row at night. So, if we subtract the number of campers who went to row in the afternoon from the total number of campers, we get: Total number of campers - Number of campers who went to row in the afternoon = 100 - 48 = 52. Therefore, 52 other campers went to row in the morning instead of at night.
Response:  We know that 33 people went fishing in the morning, 34 people went fishing in the afternoon, and 10 people went fishing in the evening. So, we can write down the following equation:  Total = Morning + Afternoon + Evening.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total = 33 + 34 + 10 = 77. Therefore, 34 people went fishing in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went fishing in the morning and 59 campers went for hikes. In addition, 21 campers went fishing in the afternoon. So, we can conclude that 21 + 13 = 34 campers went fishing altogether. Therefore, the number of campers who went fishing is 34.
Response:  We know that 29 campers went fishing in the morning and 66 campers went for hikes. So, the total number of campers who did not go fishing is 66 - 29 = 37. Therefore, the number of campers who went fishing in the morning is 29.
Response:  We know that 41 campers went fishing and 4 campers went for hikes in the morning. So, the total number of campers who did not go fishing or hiking is 37 (41 - 4). In the afternoon, 26 campers went fishing, so the total number of campers who went fishing is 26 + 4 = 30. Therefore, the total number of campers who went both fishing and hiking is 37 + 30 = 67.
Response:  We know that 43 campers went out to row in the morning, so there are 46 - 43 = 3 campers who did not go out to row in the morning. Therefore, among those who went out to row in the afternoon, there are 3 + 1 = 4 campers who went out to row in the afternoon. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Rachel has collected 4 apples from her tree and the tree had 7 apples at the beginning, then there are now 3 apples left on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples still on the tree.
Response:  At first, the tree had 4 apples (not mele). Then, Rachel picked some apples and now there are 2 apples left on the tree. So, Rachel has collected 4 + 2 = 6 apples.
Response:  If Rachel has collected 7 mature apples from her tree and now there are 5 remaining apples on the tree, then the number of immature apples (i.e., not yet ripe) must be equal to the total number of apples minus the number of apples she collected. So, we can write an equation as follows:  7 = Total Apples - Number Collected   Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  7 = 5 - 3  Solving for the number of immature apples, we get:  2 = Immature Apples  Therefore, the tree currently has 2 immature apples.
Response:  If Rachel has collected two mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 7 more apples, then at the beginning of the story, the tree had 9 apples (2 + 7 = 9). So, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 6 mature apples on her tree. Now she has 2 mature and 4 immature apples. So, initially, the tree must have had 6 + 2 = 8 apples.
Response:  If Rachel has collected 3 mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 2 mature apples and 27 immature apples, then we can say that initially the tree had 5 apples (3 + 2). So, the tree must have had 5 - 3 = 2 mature apples initially.
Response:  At first, Rachel had collected 7 meles from her tree. Then two new meals grew on the tree. So now the tree has 6 + 2 = 8 meals. Therefore, at the beginning, the tree should have had 8 - 7 = 1 meal.
Response:  The tree had two apples initially. Then, Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree. So, there are now 2 + 4 = 6 apples on the tree. After that, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree is now 6 + 3 = 9 apples.
Response:  If Rachel has already picked two apples from one of her apple trees and now that tree still has 7 apples left, then initially that tree must have had 50 apples (52 - 2 = 50). So, the initial number of apples on the tree was 50.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 3 trees with 3 apples each, so she had 3 x 3 = 9 apples in total. Then, she collected 8 apples from each tree, so she collected 8 x 3 = 24 apples in total. Now, there are still 9 apples left on the trees, so the total number of apples at the beginning was 24 + 9 = 33 apples.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has 4 apple trees and each tree has 7 apples left. So, in total, she has 4 x 7 = 28 apples. But then it says ""Ogni albero ha un totale di 29 mele ancora su di sé"". This means that each tree still has 29 apples left. Therefore, Rachel has collected 4 x 29 = 116 apples."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 2 balls more than Doug. So, if Ed has x balls, then Doug has x - 2 balls. Since Doug lost some balls in the park, he now has x - y balls where y is the number of balls he lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:
x = 19 + y... (1)
We are also given that Ed has 19 balls plus the number of balls Doug lost. So, we can write another equation:
x + y = 20... (2)
Now, we need to solve for y, which represents the number of balls Doug lost. To do this, we can substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
x + (y - 2) = 20
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
3x - 2 = 20
Solving for x, we find that Ed has 57 balls. Now, we can use the first equation to find out how many balls Doug lost:
x = 19 + y
Substituting x = 57 and y = -2, we get:
Doug lost 2 balls.
Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more bigli than Doug. So, if Doug had x bigli, then Ed had 10 + x bigli.  Since Doug lost 11 of his bigli in the park, he now has x - 11 bigli.  Now we can use the information that Ed had 45 bigli to find out how many bigli Ed had relative to Doug.  Therefore, Ed had 45 - (x - 11) = 45 - x + 11 bigli.
Response:  If Ed had 6 more than Doug, that means Ed has x = 6 + 7 = 13 biglies. Since Ed had 22 biglies initially and lost 7 of them, he now has 22 - 7 = 15 biglies. So, Doug has 15 biglies now.
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more dollars than Doug. So, if Ed had $27, then Doug must have had $27 - $5 = $22 initially.
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 balls more than Doug. So, if Doug has x balls, then Ed has 24 + x balls.  Now, we are told that Doug lost 27 balls in the park while Ed found 9 additional balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that Ed now has is: 24 + x - 27 = 9.  So, Ed has 9 more balls than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 balls more than Doug. So, if Doug had x balls, then Ed had 29 + x balls.  Now, we are told that Ed lost 17 of his balls at the park. Therefore, the number of balls Ed had after losing them is equal to 29 + x - 17 = x + 12.  Since Ed had more balls than Doug, we can conclude that x > 0. Thus, Ed had 13 balls more than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 19 balls more than Doug. So, if Ed has x balls and Doug has y balls, we can write the equation:
x = 19 + y
We also know that Ed lost some balls in the park game. So, he has fewer balls now. Let's call the number of balls Ed has after losing some as z.
z = x - (some)
Now, we are given that Ed has 8 biglies more than Doug. So, if Ed has z biglies and Doug has y biglies, we can write the equation:
z = 8 + y
Now, we need to solve for z. Can you do that?"
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more bigli than Doug. So, if Ed had 91 bigli, then Doug had 61 bigli (30 + 61 = 91). Therefore, Ed had 30 more bigli than Doug, which means that Ed had 30 + 61 = 91 bigli in total.
"Response:  If Ed had 12 more than Doug and he lost 20 of his biglies at the playground, then:

Ed = Doug + 12 - 20 =?

Solving for ""?"" we get:

Doug = Ed - (12 - 20) = Ed - 12 = 5

So, Doug has 5 biglies now."
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding potatoes and 42 students suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding bacon. Therefore, we can say that 96% of the students (408/42) preferred adding potatoes to their meal, while only 6% of the students (42/408) preferred adding bacon.
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding potatoes and 489 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we can say that there are more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested potatoes. So, the answer is (489 - 479) = 9.
Response:  Since 185 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu, and 310 students were surveyed in total, we can say that 185/310 = 0.59 (approximately) of the students suggested adding potatoes.  As for the bacon, since no student suggested it, we can say that 0 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, the answer is 0.
"Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 suggested adding bacon to the menu. This means that 90% (264/288) of the students suggested adding bacon.  Therefore, we can conclude that 10% (288-264=14) of the students did not suggest adding bacon to the menu.  Now, let's find out how many students suggested adding potato puree. The question states that ""others have suggested adding pure'di patates."" Since ""others"" is plural, it implies that there are more than one student who suggested this option. However, since we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of students who suggested adding potato puree, we will round down to 1 student. So, the answer is 1 student suggested adding potato puree."
Response:  If 457 students have suggested adding potatoes and 63 more students than those who suggested bacon (i.e., 106), then we can say that 106 students have suggested bacon. Therefore, the number of students who suggested bacon is 106.
Response:  If 182 students suggested adding potatoes and 166 students suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is greater than or equal to 166.
Response:  If 324 students suggested adding potatoes and 374 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, that means together they made 698 suggestions (324 + 374 = 698). And if 128 students suggested adding tomatoes, then the total number of participants is 698 + 128 = 826 students. Therefore, 826 students participated in suggesting new food items.
Response:  If 257 students have suggested adding potatoes and 120 of them have suggested adding bacon (pancetta), then there are 137 students who have suggested adding potatoes more than those who have suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who have suggested adding potatoes is 137.
Response:  If 144 students suggested adding potatoes and 467 students suggested adding bacon (pancetta), then there are more students who suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes in excess of those who suggested adding tomatoes is 467 - 144 = 323.
Response:  If 228 students suggested adding potatoes and 337 students suggested adding bacon (pancetta), then there are more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested pancetta is greater than the number of students who suggested potatoes. So, the answer is 337 - 228 = 109.
Response:  Since 450 students suggested adding potatoes and 38 suggested adding bacon, we know that 418 students did not participate in suggesting new food items (450 - 38 = 418). So, the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items is 418.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 351 students suggested adding only bacon, then we have a total of 569 suggestions (218 + 351). So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 351.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding bacon to the menu and 330 students suggested adding potatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes in excess of those who suggested adding bacon is 330 - 269 = 61.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. So, if we add the number of boys to the number of girls, we get: 569 + 236 = 785. Therefore, there are 785 students in the school, including both girls and boys.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 841 - 34 = 807. So, there are 807 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 students in total and 228 more girls than boys. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we will get the number of boys. Therefore, the number of boys is: 697 - 228 = 469.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls, so the total number of students is: 635 + (510 x 2) = 1145. Therefore, there are 1145 students in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. So, if there are x boys, then the total number of students is 868 + x. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, we can write:  x + (281) = 868. Solving for x, we get: x = 587. Therefore, there are 587 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, then the total number of students is: 700 + (142 - 700) = 368  So, there are 368 students in that school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. Then, another 418 girls have enrolled in the school. So, the total number of students in the school now is: 706 + 222 = 928.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, the total number of girls in the school now is: 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, the final answer is 946 girls.
Response:  We know that there are already 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then we learn that another 465 girls have enrolled in the school. So, the total number of girls in the school is now: 632 + 465 = 1097 girls. Therefore, there are 1097 girls more than the initial number of girls in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, another 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school. So, the total number of girls in the school now is:  Initially = 732 + Joined = 682 = 1414 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school initially. Then, we learn that some 496 girls and 910 boys have joined the school. So, the total number of boys in the school now is: 214 + 910 = 1124 boys. Similarly, the total number of girls in the school now is: 135 + 496 = 631 girls. Therefore, there are 1124 boys and 631 girls in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, together they make up 626 students (308 + 318). Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in total in the school. There are 36 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is 626 + 36 = 662. Therefore, there are 662 students in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys, so together they make up 624 students. Then we have 772 teachers, which means that the total number of people in the school is 624 + 772 = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people in that school.
"Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys must be less than half the total number of students. So, if there are 402 girls and 739 students in total, then the number of boys is less than half that amount, which is:

Boys = Total students - Girls
= 739 - 402
= 337

Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school."
Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then the number of girls is greater than the number of boys. So, if there are 458 girls and 692 girls, that means there are 458 + 692 = 1150 students in total in the school. Therefore, the answer is 1150.
Response:  We know that there are already 257 girls enrolled in the school. Then we learn that another 403 girls have been admitted to the school. So, the total number of girls enrolled in the school is: 257 + 403 = 660 girls.
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. So, Edward has $2 now.
Response:  If Edward had $13 and spent some money, he now has $3. So, he must have spent $10 ($13 - $3 = $10).
Response:  Edward had $9 before he spent any money. Then, he spent $8 more, so now he has $17. To find out how much he had before, we can subtract the amount he spent from his current balance: $17 - $8 = $9. So, Edward had $9 before he started spending his money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so he had $16 - $92 = -$76 left before he spent his money. Now we are told that he has $6 left, so he must have had $6 + (-$76) = $82 before he spent any money. Therefore, Edward had $82 before buying the books.
Response:  If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books and now has $12, that means he had $6 + $6 = $12 before buying the books. So each book cost half of the amount he had before, which is $12 / 2 = $6.
Response:  Edward spent $6 for books and $16 for pens. So he has $19 left after buying those things. To find out how much he had before buying them, we can subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount of money: $19 - $6 = $13. Therefore, Edward had $13 before buying the books and pens.
Response:  Edward has spent $4 for books and $3 for pens, so he has spent a total of $7 (4 + 3). Since he now has $12, we can deduce that he had $5 left after buying the books and pens ($12 - $7 = $5). Therefore, Edward spent $7 on books and pens.
Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens, so he had $16 + $8 = $24 before buying anything else. Now he has $24 - $19 = $5 left. Therefore, Edward spent more money on books than on pens.
Response:  Before he spent his money, Edward had $17. Then, he received $10 from his friend. So now he has $7 left. Therefore, Edward had $17 before he spent any money.
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 44 flexions in the gym today and David has done more than Zachary. So, we can write an equation:
Zachary = 44
David > Zachary (more than)
Now, let's find out how many flexions David did. Since David has done more than Zachary, his number of flexions must be greater than Zachary's number of flexions. Therefore, we can write another equation:
David = x (where x is a positive integer)
We are also given that David has done more than Zachary, so we can say that x > 44. Now, we have two equations:

Zachary = 44
x > 44
To solve for x, we can subtract the first equation from the second one:
x - 44 = > 0
Since x is a positive integer, we can only have whole numbers as solutions. Therefore, the answer is:
x = 58
So, David did 58 flexions in the gym today."
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 flexions and David has done 44 flexions. So, we can write:
Zachary = 51
David = 44
Now, to find out how many more flexions Zachary did than David, we need to subtract David's number of flexions from Zachary's number of flexions:
Difference = Zachary - David = 51 - 44 = 7
So, Zachary has done 7 more flexions than David."
Response:  We know that David has done 44 flexions in the gym today and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x flexions, then David did 44 + 9 = 53 flexions. Therefore, Zachary did 53 flexions.
Response:  We know that David has done 51 flexions in the gym today and he did 49 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary has done x flexions, then David has done 51 - 49 = 2 flexions more than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary has done x = 53 flexions in the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 59 flexions and 44 hugs at the gym today. Then we are told that David has done 19 more flexions than Zachary but 27 more small hugs than him. So, if David has done x flexions, then he must have done 59 + x hugs. Therefore, David has done 59 + 19 = 78 hugs at the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 44 flexions and 17 hugs at the gym today. If we add 29 more flexions than Zachary did, it means David has done 68 flexions (29 + 44). However, since David did 13 fewer hugs than Zachary, David has done 30 hugs (17 - 13). Therefore, David has done 68 flexions and 30 hugs at the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 53 flexions and 14 hugs at the gym today. If David did 17 more flexions than Zachary, then David did 53 + 17 = 70 flexions. However, we also know that David did 10 fewer hugs than Zachary, so David did 14 - 10 = 4 hugs. Therefore, Zachary did 53 flexions and 4 hugs.
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 35 flexions and 3 hugs at the gym today.  David has done 58 more flexions than Zachary but 87 fewer hugs. So, if we call x the number of flexions made by Zachary, we can write:
x + 35 = 58 (David did 23 more flexions than Zachary)
x - 3 = 87 (David did 87 fewer hugs than Zachary)
Now, we want to find out how many more flexions Zachary has done than David. Using the first equation, we get:
Zachary's flexions - David's flexions = 58 - x
= 58 - 23
= 35
So, Zachary has done 35 more flexions than David."
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 46 flexions and 58 hugs at the gym today. David has done 38 more flexions than Zachary but 62 fewer hugs. So, if Zachary did x hugs, then David did x + 38 hugs. Therefore, Zachary did 58 - 38 = 20 hugs more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 19 flexions at the gym today. Then we are told that David has done 39 more flexions than Zachary. So, David has done 39 + 19 = 58 flexions at the gym today. Finally, we learn from the last part of the question that John has done 13 fewer flexions than David. Therefore, David has done 58 - 13 = 45 flexions at the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 flexions at the gym today. Then we are told that David did more than Zachary (David did 22 flexions more). So, if David did 22 more flexions than Zachary, then Zachary did x flexions. Since John did 4 fewer flexions than David, John did x - 4 flexions. Therefore, John did 37 flexions (x - 4) at the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 15 flexions at the gym today.  David has done 39 more flexions than Zachary, so David has done 39 + 15 = 54 flexions at the gym today.  Since John has done 9 fewer flexions than David, John has done 54 - 9 = 45 flexions at the gym today. Therefore, Zachary has done 45 - 9 = 36 more flexions than John.
Response:  We know that David has done more than Zachary in the gym today. So, if David did 30 flexions and he made 37 flexions, then Zachary must have done fewer than 30 flexions. Therefore, the number of flexions Zachary did is equal to 30 - X, where X is the number of flexions Zachary did. Now we are asked to find out how many flexions Zachary did. Since David did 37 flexions, we can set up the equation: 37 = 30 - X. Solving for X, we get: X = 7. So, Zachary did 7 flexions in the gym today.
Response:  If David has done 56 more flexions than Zachary, that means Zachary did x flexions and David did 56 + x flexions. So we can write the equation:  David = 56 + x. Now we know that David did 38 flexions, so we can substitute this value into the equation to find out how many flexions Zachary did: 38 = 56 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 18. Therefore, Zachary did 18 flexions and David did 56 + 18 = 74 flexions.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 62abbracci and David has done 40 more flessioni than Zachary. So, David has done 62 + 40 = 102abbracci.
Response:  We know that David has done 36 more flexions than Zachary and 33 fewer hugs. So, if Zachary did 58 flexions and 33 hugs, then David did 58 - 33 = 25 more flexions than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary did 58 + 25 = 83 flexions and 33 hugs.
Response:  We know that David has done 27 more flexions than Zachary and 7 less hugs. So, if Zachary did 5 flexions and 17 hugs, then David did 5 + 27 = 32 flexions and 10 (instead of 17) hugs. Therefore, David did 10 more hugs than Zachary.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension, then she had more math homework than reading comprehension. So, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading comprehension is 5 - 2 = 3 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 3 extra pages of math homework compared to reading comprehension.
Response:  Rachel has to complete 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, she needs to do 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and additional 3 pages of reading comprehension, that means she completed 8 pages (5 + 3) of homework in total. So, if she has to complete a total of 7 pages of homework at home, then she would have to complete 1 page more than what she already completed (7 - 8 = -1). Therefore, Rachel would have to complete no pages of reading comprehension at home.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and she completed 4 more pages than she did for reading comprehension, then...  So, if Rachel completed 7 + 4 = 11 pages of math homework, that means she had to complete 11 - 7 = 4 pages of reading comprehension. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and she has to complete 3 more pages than she did for reading comprehension, then she needs to complete an additional 5 pages (since 3 is greater than 1). So, in total, Rachel needs to complete 13 pages (8 + 5) of homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework and she completes 6 pages more than her math homework, then she has completed 14 pages (8 + 6) of total homework. So, she needs to complete 6 pages of reading comprehension homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 10 pages of math homework and she needs to complete 3 more pages of reading comprehension than math, then...  So, if she completes 3 more pages of reading comprehension than math, that means she will have completed 10 + 3 = 13 pages of total homework. Therefore, she still needs to complete 7 pages (10 - 3) of math homework.
Response:  Rachel had to complete two pages of math homework, three pages of reading comprehension, and ten pages of biology. So, she had to complete a total of 15 pages of homework (2 + 3 + 10 = 15).
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and she completed 2 pages, then she has 9 - 2 = 7 pages left to complete.  Now, let's find out how many more pages of math homework Rachel has compared to reading homework. So, if she has 7 pages left for math and 96 pages for biology, then we can say that she has 7 / 96 = 0.073pages more math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the answer is 0.073 pages.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework and she completed 2 pages of reading comprehension, then she has 9 pages left for math. Now, if she also had to complete 3 pages of biology homework, that means she has 6 pages left for math after completing the biology homework. So, the difference between the number of pages of math homework Rachel had to complete and the number of pages of biology homework she had to complete is 6 - 2 = 4 pages. Therefore, Rachel has 4 more pages of math homework than biology homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So far, she has completed 7 + 11 = 18 pages of homework. Now we are asked how many more pages of reading comprehension homework Rachel had to complete than biology homework. In other words, we need to find out how many pages of reading comprehension homework Rachel had left to do after completing her biology homework. Let's assume that Rachel completed all 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Then, we can see that she had 8 - 11 = -3 pages of reading comprehension homework left to do after completing her biology homework. Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of reading comprehension homework than biology homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So far, she has completed 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework. However, we are also given that she had to complete an additional 29 pages of biology homework. Therefore, in total, Rachel had to complete 20 + 29 = 49 pages of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 3 pages of biology homework. So in total she had to do 8 + 3 = 11 pages of homework.
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 10 pages of reading comprehension. So far, she has completed 5 + 10 = 15 pages of work. Now we are asked how many pages of biology homework she had to complete. The question states ""other 6 pages"" which means that in addition to the 10 pages of reading comprehension, Rachel also had to complete 6 pages of biology homework for a total of 16 pages (10 + 6). Therefore, Rachel had to complete 16 pages of homework in total."
Response:  If Rachel had to complete two pages of reading comprehension and four pages of math problems, that means she completed 2 + 4 = 6 pages of math problems. So, Rachel had to do 6 more pages of math problems than reading comprehension.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension and 7 pages of math problems. So, the total number of pages she had to do is 4 + 7 = 11 pages. Now, we are asked how many more pages of math problems Rachel had to do compared to the reading comprehension. To find this out, we can subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension from the total number of pages she had to do: 11 - 4 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 7 more pages of math problems than reading comprehension.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 emails and at afternoon he received 2 emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write:

Morning emails = 6
Afternoon emails = 8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning (by 2 emails)."
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and other 3 in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 emails during the day (4 + 3 = 7). So, Jack received 7 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  In one day, Jack received emails at 6 am, 3 pm, and 5 pm. So, he received a total of 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails that day.
Response:  Jack has received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, he has received a total of 13 emails during these two time slots. However, we are also asked how many emails he received at night. According to the question, Jack received 72 emails at night. Therefore, the final answer is:  Mattina/Pomeriggio: 13 Emails Night: 72 Emails
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails in the daytime (morning + afternoon).  He also received 8 emails at night, for a total of 17 emails.
Response:  Jack has received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon, so he has received a total of 7 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon).  As for the evening, Jack has received 8 emails, so he has received a total of 7 + 8 = 15 emails in all. Therefore, Jack has received 3 emails in the morning and 12 emails in the evening.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 10 emails.  At afternoon, he received 7 emails. So, in total, Jack received 10 + 7 = 17 emails during the daytime hours (morning and afternoon). Now, we need to find out how many more emails Jack received at night compared to the number of emails he received during the daytime hours. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received during the daytime from the total number of emails he received: 17 - 15 = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails at night than he did during the daytime hours.
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 in the afternoon and 7 at night. So, we can write down the total number of emails he received as follows: $9 + 10 + 7 = 26$ Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than at any other time of day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails during the daytime. Now, we are asked how many more emails Jack received in the evening compared to the number of emails he received at night. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of emails he received at night from the number of emails he received during the daytime. In this case, Jack received 4 emails at night, so the difference between the number of emails he received during the daytime and those he received at night is:  15 - 4 = 11 emails.  Therefore, Jack received 11 more emails in the afternoon than he did at night.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the evening.  Conclusion: Jack received 10 emails in total throughout the day.
Response:  In total, Jack received 3 + 64 = 67 emails and letters that day.  In the afternoon, he received 5 emails, so the number of emails he received that day is 67 - 5 = 62.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. In the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters. So, in total, Jack received 5 + 6 = 11 emails and 7 + 9 = 16 letters during the day.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in total. In the afternoon, he received 3 more emails and 44 more letters. So, if we subtract the number of emails and letters he received in the afternoon from the total number he received throughout the day, we get:  10 + 12 = 22 (emails and letters received throughout the day) - 3 = 19 (emails and letters received in the morning) Therefore, Jack received 19 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in total each day. In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters. So, if we subtract the number of emails and letters he received in the afternoon from the total number he received each day, we get:  6 + 8 = 14 (total daily emails and letters) - 2 = 12 (emails and letters received in the morning) Therefore, Jack received 12 more letters in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack has received 6 emails and sent 91 letters, so he has received/sent a total of 97 letters (6 + 91 = 97). Since he received 2 emails and sent 74 letters in the afternoon, he received a total of 2 + 74 = 76 letters that day. Therefore, Jack received 76 emails that day.
Response:  Jack has received 4 emails and sent 2 letters today. So far, he has handled 6 communications (4 emails + 2 letters). In the afternoon, he received 6 more emails and sent 8 letters, for a total of 14 communications that day (6 + 8 = 14). Therefore, Jack sent 8 emails in one day.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and he received other emails in the afternoon, then we can assume that he received x emails in the afternoon. Since he received a total of 9 emails, we know that x + 7 = 9. Solving for x, we get x = 2. So, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, Jack received 8 emails in total during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now, let's compare this number with the number of emails he received at night: 16. So, Jack received 16 - 8 = 8 more emails at night than he did during the daytime.
Response:  We know that Jack has received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, for a total of 9 emails during the day. So, if he received 10 emails in total, then he must have received 1 email more in the evening. Therefore, Jack received 4 emails in the evening.
Response:  We know that the cavalletta jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 12 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped beyond the cavalletta, we need to subtract the distance the cavalletta jumped from the distance the frog jumped. So, the answer is:  Distance = 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches beyond the cavalletta.
Response:  The cavalletta jumped 30 cm and the frog jumped 35 cm. So, together they jumped a total of:  30 + 35 = 65 cm.
Response:  We know that the cavalettasalted 36 inches and the frog jumped x inches more than the cavalettathe frog jumped 17 inches more than the cavalettathen we have to add the distance traveled by the frog to find out how far the frog actually jumped. So, the total distance traveled by the frog is equal to 36 + 17 = 53 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 53 inches.
"Response:  We know that the cavalett... (read more)

Answer: The toad jumped 30 inches.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the distance traveled by each animal as follows:

* Cavalletta jumped 25 inches.
* Rana jumped 18 inches plus 25 = 43 inches beyond the cavalletta.
* Topo jumped 2 inches beyond the rana, which is 45 inches.

Therefore, the toad jumped 30 inches (45 - 2 = 30)."
"Response:  The cavalettasalted 19 inches, then the frog jumped 10 inches more than that, and the mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog. So, the distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is:

Distance = Cavalettasalt + Frogjump + Mousejump
= 19 + (10 + 20)
= 59 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 59 inches beyond the cavalettas starting point."
"Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 pollici more than the cavalett... (read more)

Solution:
Let's think step by step. We know that the frog jumped 39 pollici more than the cavalletta, so the frog jumped $39 + 19 = 58$ pollici. Therefore, the frog jumped $58$ pollici."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 32 inches beyond the horse and the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog. So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the mouse jumped x - 26 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 32 - (x - 26) = 32 + 26 = 58 inches.
"Response:  We know that the frog jumped 33 inches more than the horse and the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog. So, if the horse jumped x inches, then the frog jumped x + 33 inches, and the mouse jumped x - 5 inches. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 33) = 50...(1)

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

x + 33 = 50 - x

Simplifying further:

2x + 33 = 50

Subtracting 33 from both sides gives us:

2x = 17

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 8

So, the mouse jumped 8 inches less than the horse."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped $5$ cm more than the horse. So, if the horse jumped $13$ inches, then the frog jumped $18$ inches ($5$ cm + $13$ inches).
Response:  The frog jumped 20 cm more than the horse, so the total distance of the frog's jump is: $35 + (20 \text{ cm} ) = 55 \text{ cm}$.
"Response:  We know that the frog jumped x centimeters more than the toad and less than the grasshopper. So we can write an equation:
x = (19 - 15) cm = 4 cm
Therefore, the frog jumped 4 centimeters more than the toad."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 19 inches more than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog. So, if the grasshopper jumped x inches, then the frog jumped x + 19 inches. Similarly, if the mouse jumped y inches, then it jumped y - 12 inches. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: Grasshopper = x Mouse = y Substituting the values given in the question, we get: x + 19 = 39 y - 12 =? Solving for y, we get: y = 27 Therefore, the mouse jumped 27 inches.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 25 inches more than the rabbit and the cricket jumped 16 inches less than the frog. So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the rabbit jumped x - 16 inches. Therefore, the distance between the frog and the rabbit is equal to x + 25 = (x - 16) + 25. Solving for x, we get x = 31 inches. Thus, the cricket jumped 31 inches farther than the rabbit.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the cricket jumped 17 inches. To find out how many more inches the frog jumped than the cricket, we can subtract their heights: 39 - 17 = 22 inches. So, the frog jumped 22 inches more than the cricket.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 15 cm more than the donkey, who jumped 9 in. So, if we subtract 9 from 15, we get 6 (the distance the frog jumped). Now, we are told that the mouse jumped 10 cm less than the frog. Therefore, the mouse jumped 6 - 10 = 4 cm.
"Response:  We know that the frog jumped 37 inches more than the donkey, who jumped 14 inches. So, the distance traveled by the frog is:

Distance = 37 + 14 = 51 inches

Now, we need to find out how many inches the mouse jumped less than the donkey. To do this, we can subtract the distance traveled by the mouse from the distance traveled by the donkey:

Distance = 51 - x = 51 (where x is the distance traveled by the mouse)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40 inches

So, the mouse jumped 40 inches less than the donkey."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tazze of flour (which is equal to 3/4 of one cup). So, if we subtract this amount from the total amount of flour needed (14 tazze), we get 9 tazze left to be added (since 14 - 5 = 9). Now, let's compare this amount with the amount of sugar needed (6 tazze): since there are 2 tazze of sugar for every 1 tazza of flour, we can see that Mary needs to add an additional 9 / 2 = 4.5 tazze of sugar more than she has already added (i.e., 6 - 4.5 = 1.5 tazze). Therefore, Mary should add 4.5 tazze of sugar more to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazze of flour (which is equal to 4/5 of the total amount needed). So, we need to find out how much zucchero she needs to add now. To do this, we can use the following calculation: Total amount of zucchero = Remaining amount of flour x Amount of zucchero per tazza of flour Total amount of zucchero = 9 - 4 = 5 tazze Farine remaining = 11 - 4 = 7 tazze Zucchero per tazza of flour = 11 / 7 = 1 and 3/4 tazze Of course, you round up to the nearest half tazza, so the final answer is 2 and a half tazze of zucchero.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some farina to the mixture and now she needs 8 more tazze of farina than the amount of sugar. So, if there are 13 tazze of sugar, we can calculate the number of tazze of farina needed as follows:

Farina required = Sugar quantity x Farina required per unit of sugar
= 13 tazze x 2/5 (since each tazza of sugar is equivalent to 2/5 tazze of farina)
= 46 tazze

Therefore, Mary must add 46 tazze of farina to the mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to make the cake batter. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, and she needs 2 more cups than the amount of sugar used (7 cups). So if she has already added x cups of flour, then she needs 2 + x cups of flour in total. Since she only has 13 cups of flour available, we can set up the equation:

x + (2 + x) = 13

Simplifying this equation gives us:

3x + 2 = 13

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

3x = 11

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 4

So Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to the batter. To find out how much sugar she has added, we can use the information given in the question: ""Se le servono ancora due tazze di zucchero."" Two cups is equal to 16 tablespoons, so Mary has added 16 tablespoons of sugar to the batter."
Response:  The recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and some other cups of flour. Mary has already added 3 cups of flour. So, she needs to add 6 more cups of flour. Therefore, the answer is 9 cups (11 - 3 + 6).
"Response:  If Mary has already added some flour and the recipe calls for 12 cups of flour in total, then she must have added at least some amount of flour.  So, let's assume that she has added x cups of flour so far. Then, we know that the remaining amount of flour needed is equal to 12 - x cups.
Now, if she still needs to add 2 cups of flour, it means that she has added less than 12 cups of flour initially. Therefore, the amount of flour she has added can be calculated as follows:
x = 12 - (2) = 10 cups
So, Mary has added 10 cups of flour so far."
"Response:  We know that we have already added 3 tazze of flour and 62 tazze of sugar. To find out how many more tazze of flour we need to add, let's divide the total amount of flour needed (9 tazze) by the amount of flour we have already added (3 tazze):

Total amount of flour needed = 9 tazze
Amount of flour already added = 3 tazze
Number of tazze of flour left to add = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour already added
= 9 tazze - 3 tazze
= 6 tazze
Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more tazze of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that we have already added 2 tazze of sugar to the mixture and the recipe requires 14 tazze in total. So, we need to add 12 more tazze of sugar (14 - 2 = 12).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tazze of flour and the recipe requires 12 tazze in total. So we need to find out how many more tazze she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour (12 - 11 = 1) by the amount of flour per serving (1 tazza). This gives us 1 tazza of flour left to add. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more tazza of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 tazze of flour (which is equal to 70 tazze). So, we need to find out how many more tazze of flour she needs to add compared to the amount of sugar and salt. The ratio between flour, sugar, and salt is given as follows: Flour = 10 : Sugar = 2 : Salt = 80. Therefore, if Mary wants to make a total of 10 tazze of flour, she will need to add 8 tazze of flour more than the amount of sugar and salt combined. In this case, Mary needs to add 8 tazze of flour + 2 tazze of sugar + 80 tazze of salt = 90 tazze of flour. So, Mary needs to add an additional 90 - 70 = 20 tazze of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two tazze of flour (2). The recipe calls for 12 tazze of flour in total (12). So, to find out how many more tazze of flour Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed: 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 10 tazze of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tazze of flour (which is equal to 1/2 of the total amount needed). So, we need to find out how much less than half of the remaining amount of each ingredient she needs to add now.  Zucchero: Since there are 8 tazze of sugar and Mary has already added 5 tazze, she needs to add 3 more tazze of sugar (equal to 40% of the remaining amount). Sale: Since there are 7 tazze of salt and Mary has already added 5 tazze, she needs to add 2 more tazze of salt (equal to 28% of the remaining amount). Therefore, to answer your question, Mary needs to add 3 tazze of zucchero and 2 tazze of sale.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two tazze of sugar (13 - 2 = 11). So, she needs to add 11 more tazze of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazze of sugar to her mixture and now she needs to add more flour. So, we need to find out how many tazze of flour are needed to make up for the amount of sugar she has already added. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar (9 tazze) by the amount of sugar she has already added (4 tazze). This gives us 2.25 tazze of flour that Mary needs to add next. Since you cannot have a fraction of a tazza, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2 tazze of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more tazze of flour to her mixture.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 tazze of sugar and 9 tazze of flour in the recipe.  Mary has already added 2 tazze of flour, so we need to find out how many more tazze she needs to add to have the same amount of flour as sugar.  To do this, we can divide the number of tazze of sugar (6) by the number of tazze of flour (9) and then subtract the number of tazze of flour Mary has already added (2):

6 / 9 = 0.67 (approximately)
0.67 - 2 = 0.47 (approximately)
So, Mary needs to add approximately 0.47 tazze of flour more than the amount of sugar in the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tazze of flour (which is equal to 11/14 of the total amount needed). So, we need to find out how much sugar she needs to add now. To do this, we can use the following calculation:

Sugar needed = Total amount of sugar - Amount of sugar already used
= 5 tazze - 11/14 x 5 tazze
= 5 tazze - 3.57 tazze
= 1.43 tazze

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1.43 tazze of sugar more than the original recipe called for."
"Response:  If Mary has already added some flour and needs 5 more tazze of flour to make the recipe complete, then she must have added x tazze of flour so far. Since the total amount of flour needed is 10 tazze, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 10... (1)

Now, let's find out how much sugar Mary has added so far. The recipe calls for 3 tazze of sugar, but since Mary has already added some sugar, we need to subtract the amount she has added from the total amount needed:

3 - x = 3... (2)

where x is the amount of sugar Mary has added so far.

Now we can solve both equations simultaneously:

(1) x + 5 = 10
(2) 3 - x = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So Mary has added 8 tazze of flour and 3 tazze of sugar so far."
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour and the recipe calls for 13 tazze of flour, then she must have added less than 13 tazze since she doesn't have enough to cover the entire amount needed. So let's assume she has added x tazze of flour. Then we know that the total amount of flour Mary has is equal to x + 13 (since she still needs to add 12 more tazze). Now, if the recipe calls for 5 tazze of sugar, we can calculate how much sugar Mary has used so far by subtracting the amount of flour she has added from the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe: 5 - (x + 13) =?. Can you solve for x now?
Response:  We know that we have already added 7 tazze of farina and 60 tazze of sugar. The recipe calls for a total of 14 tazze of farina, so we need to subtract the amount we have already used (7) from the total amount needed (14). Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more tazze of farina.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tazze of sugar and she needs to add more. So, we need to subtract 10 from 11 (the amount of sugar needed) to find out how many more tazze of sugar Mary should add. Therefore, Mary must add 1 more tazza of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 tazze of flour (which is equal to 6/10 of the total amount needed). So we need to find out how much more flour she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour needed by the amount of flour she has already added:  Remaining amount = Total amount - Amount already added = 3 tazze x 10 tazze / 6 tazze = 5 tazze Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 5 tazze of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazze of flour to her mixture and the recipe requires 14 tazze of flour in total. So, we need to find out how many more tazze of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour required (14 - 4 = 10) by the amount of flour she has already added (4). This means that Mary needs to add an additional 2.5 tazze of flour (10 / 4 = 2.5). Therefore, the answer is 2.5 tazze of flour.
Response:  We know that there are 7 tazze of flour in the recipe and we have already used 2 tazze. So, to find out how many more tazze of flour we need to add, we can subtract the number of tazze we have already used from the total amount of flour needed:  7 - 2 = 5 tazze of flour left to add. Therefore, we need to add 5 tazze of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 tazze of flour left to add after Mary has added 12 tazze of flour. So, we can calculate how much sugar is needed as follows:

Sugar required = Total amount of sugar - Amount of flour already added
= 11 tazze - 6 tazze
= 5 tazze

Therefore, Mary needs 5 more tazze of sugar than she has already added."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tazze of sugar to her mixture. To find out how many more tazze she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (7 tazze) by the amount she has already added (4 tazze). So, Mary needs to add an additional 3 tazze of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tazze of sugar to her mixture. The recipe requires 12 tazze of sugar total. So, we need to find out how many more tazze of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the amount of sugar left (12 - 10 = 2) by the amount of sugar required per tazza (1 tazza = 1/12). This gives us 2 / 1/12 = 2 tazze of flour needed for each tazza of sugar remaining. Since there are 3 tazze of sugar remaining (12 - 10 = 3), Mary needs to add 3 x 2 = 6 tazze of flour. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 tazze of flour.
Response:  We know that 60 families of birds have left for winter and there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain. So, we can say that the total number of families of birds is 60 + 19 = 79. Therefore, the number of families of birds that did not leave for winter is 79 - 60 = 19.
Response:  We know that 7 families of birds have left for winter and there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain. So, if we subtract the number of families that have left (7) from the total number of families (87), we get:  Number of families remaining = 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, 80 families of birds remain behind at the mountain during the winter migration.
"Response:  We know that 20 families of birds have left for winter while 14 families have stayed behind. So, if we subtract the number of families that left from the total number of families living near the mountain at the beginning, we get:  
Total number of families = Number of families that left + Number of families that stayed
= 20 + 14
= 34
Therefore, there were 34 families of birds living near the mountain at the beginning of winter."
Response:  We know that 23 families of birds have left for Africa and 37 families of birds have left for Asia. So, the total number of families of birds that have left = 23 + 37 = 60. Now, we are asked how many families of birds are remaining near the mountain. Since 85 is the initial number of families, after 60 have left, the remaining number of families = 85 - 60 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 42 families of birds have left for Africa and 31 families of birds have left for Asia. So, we can write this as:

42 + 31 = 73

Now, we are told that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain. So, if 42 families of birds have left for Africa and 31 families of birds have left for Asia, then the number of families of birds remaining near the mountain is:

73 - (42 + 31) = 73 - 73 = 0

Therefore, zero families of birds remain near the mountain after migration."
Response:  We know that 47 families of birds have left for Africa and 94 families of birds have left for Asia. So, if we subtract the number of families that went to Africa from the total number of families that left (94 - 47 = 47), then we can determine how many families of birds are left in Asia. Therefore, there are 47 families of birds left in Asia.
Response:  We know that 18 families of birds live near the mountain and they are not going to fly away for winter. So, we have 18 families of birds left nearby the mountain. Now, let's consider the number of families of birds that flew away from Africa and Asia. From the question, we know that 38 families of birds fled from Africa and 80 families of birds fled from Asia. Therefore, the total number of families of birds that flew away for winter is:  38 + 80 = 118 families of birds. Since there were initially 18 families of birds living nearby the mountain, the number of families of birds remaining nearby the mountain after winter is:  18 - 118 = -100 families of birds. In other words, there are no families of birds remaining nearby the mountain after winter since all of them flew away.
Response:  If there are already 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 18 new families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now 87 + 18 = 105 families.
Response:  We know that 59 families of birds have fled for winter and 24 new families of birds have come to live near the mountain from the Arctic. So, the total number of bird families near the mountain is:  59 + 24 = 83 families. Therefore, there are 83 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
"Response:  If there were initially 41 families of birds living near the mountain and 27 families have migrated away for winter, then the number of families of birds remaining near the mountain is:  
$$ Number \text{ of } \text{families} = 41 - 27 = 14 $$  Therefore, there are 14 families of birds remaining near the mountain."
Response:  If there were initially 45 families of birds living near the mountain and now 86 families of birds have fled for winter, then we can say that the number of families of birds that have fled is equal to the initial number minus the remaining ones. So, the answer would be: Number of families of birds that have fled = 45 - (Initial number of families of birds living near the mountain) = 45 - 45 = 0 families of birds have fled.
"Response:  We know that 35 families of birds have left for Asia and 62 families have left for Africa. So, if we subtract the number of families that went to Asia from the total number of families (41), we get:  
Number of families that went to Africa = 41 - 35 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more families of birds that went to Africa than those who went to Asia."
Response:  We know that:  * The winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer places.  * There are 3 families of birds living near the mountain.  * 26 new families of birds have moved to live near the mountain from the Arctic.  * 2 families of birds have flown further south for the winter.  So, we can conclude that there are:  Families of birds remaining near the mountain = Number of families of birds not migrating + Number of families of birds already living nearby - Number of families of birds moving away for the winter.  Using this formula, we get:  Families of birds remaining near the mountain = 3 + 26 - 2 = 27 families of birds remaining near the mountain. Therefore, there are 27 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
Response:  At first, Paul had 253 pastelles for his birthday. Then he lost or gave away 70 of them during the school year. So, at the end of the school year, how many pastilles did Paul have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of pastilles he lost or gave away from the total number of pastilles he received. In this case, that means subtracting 70 from 253. Doing so gives us the final number of pastilles Paul had at the end of the school year: 183. Therefore, the answer is 183.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 551 pastels and he lost or gave away 374 of them. So, after losing/giving away so many, he was left with only 177 pastels. Now, we are asked how many pastels his friends have given him for his birthday. Since they have not specified any number directly, let's assume that they have given him an equal amount to what he had left (177). Therefore, the number of pastels his friends have given him is also 177.
Response:  If Paul has given away 111 markers during the school year and he has lost 106, then he must have had how many markers at first?  To find out, we can use the information that he received 440 markers for his birthday. So, if he gave away x markers and lost y markers, then he must have started with 440 - x + y markers. Now, we need to solve for x and y using the clues provided in the question. We know that x is equal to 111 (the number of markers he gave away) and y is equal to 106 (the number of markers he lost). Therefore, we can write the equation: 440 - x + y = 111 - 106 = 5. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 111 and y = 95. So, Paul has 5 markers left after giving away 111 and losing 95.
"Response:  We know that Paul received $65$ pastelles for his birthday and gave away $213$ markers during the school year. So, we can write an equation:
$$65 + 213 =?$$
We also know that he lost or gave away $16$ markers. So, we can add this to our previous equation:
$$65 + 213 - 16 =?$$
Now let's solve for the unknown value using subtraction:
$$70 =?$$
So, there were $70$ markers in total that Paul had at some point during the school year. Of these, he gave away $213$ and lost or gave away $16$, leaving him with $70$."
Response:  We know that Paul has given away 571 pastels and lost 161. So he has 400 left (589 - 161 = 400). Now we need to find out how many more pastels he gave away than he had initially. To do this, we can subtract the number of pastels he gave away from the initial amount he received: 589 - 571 = 18. Therefore, Paul gave away 18 more pastels than he had initially.
Response:  We know that Paul received 110 pastels for his birthday and gave away 90 to his friends during the school year. This means he has 20 pastels left (110 - 90 = 20). Now we are asked how many more pastels he lost besides those given away. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pastels he gave away from the total number he received: 20 - 90 = -70. So, Paul lost 70 pastels besides the ones he gave away.
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 markers during the school year and lost 558 of them, that means he has 65 markers left (563 - 558 = 65).  If he received 332 markers for his birthday, then he has a total of 985 markers (65 + 332 = 985). So, to answer your question, Paul received 985 markers for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul has given away 52 pastels and lost or regifted 535. So, if he had only 492 left, then he must have given away more than he had initially (since he started with 52). Therefore, the number of pastels he gave away is greater than 492 - 52 = 440.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 521 pastelles and 66 gummies in total (pastelles + gummies = 587). Then he received some more gummies as a gift (66), so his new total is 587 + 66 = 653. Now we need to find out how many gummies Paul lost or gave away during the school year. He said that at the end of the year, he was left with only 154 gummies, which means that he lost/gave away 66 - 154 = 90 gummies. Therefore, 90 gummies were lost or given away during the school year.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 531 pastelles and 38 gummies. If he didn't lose any gummi during the year, then he must have given away or used 140 gummies (531 - 38 = 140). Now we are left with 391 pastries. Since each pastry is colored, there are 391 colored candies in total. So, the number of colored candies Paul has left is 391.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 601 pastelles and 406 gummies for his birthday. Then he gave some away as presents and ended up with 336 left without losing any gummys. So if he started with 406 gummies, then he must have given away 85 (406 - 336) gummies during the year. Now we need to find out how many more gummies than mates he has. Since he has 336 gummies left and 601 pastilles, he must have 265 mate (601 - 336 = 265). Therefore, Paul has 265 more gummies than mates.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 315 pastelles and he lost or gave away 315. So, if he received some as gift for his birthday, it means that he has less than 315 left. Let's assume he got 291 pastilles as gifts. Now we can calculate the number of pastilles he had at the end of the year: Number of pastilles at the end of the year = Total number of pastilles at the begining of the year - Number of pastilles he lost or gave away + Number of pastilles he received as gifts Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pastilles at the end of the year = 315 - 315 + 291 = 0 Pastille! That means Paul didn't receive any pastilles as gifts for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 pastels for his birthday and lost 231 during the school year. So he has 36 pastels left (267 - 231 = 36). Now we need to find out how many pastels he gave away. According to the question, he gave away 308 pastels. Therefore, the number of pastels he gave away is equal to the number of pastels he had left minus the number of pastels he lost: 36 - 231 = -195. So, Paul gave away 195 pastels.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 457 gumballs and 320 lollipops. If he didn't lose any gumballs or lollipops during the school year, then he must have received 457 + 320 = 777 treats in total. At the end of the year, he was left with 523 treats, which means he gave away 777 - 523 = 254 treats during the year. So, Paul has 254 lollipops of different colors left.
Response:  At first, there were 11 customers. After some of them left, there were 3 remaining customers. So, the number of customers who remained is 3 - 11 = -8. Therefore, there are 8 fewer customers than at first.
Response:  At first, the waiter had 3 clients. Then, some of them left, so he had fewer clients. How many clients did he have after they left? We are told that he still had 4 clients after they left. So, the number of clients who remained is equal to the original number minus the number who left. In other words, the difference between the initial number of clients and the number who left. Therefore, the answer is 3 - x = 4, where x is the number of clients who left. Solving for x, we get x = 1. So, there were 2 clients remaining after some of them left.
Response:  At first, the waiter had x clients. After 9 clients left, he had x - 9 clients. Then, he gained 12 new clients, so he had x + 12 clients at the end. Therefore, the number of clients the waiter had at the beginning is x = 15.
Response:  At first, the waiter had 14 customers. Then, 5 of them left, so he has fewer customers now. Therefore, the number of customers the waiter still has is 14 - 5 = 9. So, the waiter has 9 customers remaining.
Response:  At first, the waiter had 13 customers. Then, some of them left, so he had fewer customers. After that, 4 new customers arrived, so he now has 4 + 13 = 17 customers. Therefore, the number of clients the waiter still has is 17 - 9 = 8.
Response:  At first, the waiter had 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, so he had 12 - 15 = -3 customers. But then, he gained 14 new customers, so he has now +14 = 9 customers. Therefore, the waiter has 9 customers remaining.
Response:  The first customer arrived and there was only one cameriere (C), so C had 1 client. Then, another customer arrived and there were now two customers in total (C + new customer). So, the number of clients for the cameriere increased from 1 to 2. Next, after some time, other customers arrived, bringing the total number of clients to 8. Therefore, the number of new customers who arrived is 8 - 2 = 6.
Response:  At first, the waiter had 8 customers. Then, some of them left, so he had 5 remaining customers. Later, 99 new customers arrived. Therefore, the number of customers the waiter has now is: 8 - 5 + 99 = 102. So, the waiter has 102 customers left.
Response:  At first, the waiter had 12 customers. Then, some of them left, so he had 14 customers. Finally, 10 new customers arrived, bringing the total number to 24. Therefore, the waiter now has 24 customers.
Response:  If Dan had $5 at first and spent $2 on the candy bar, he would have $3 left ($5 - $2 = $3). So, his initial amount of money was $5.
Response:  We know that Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 on a candy bar. So, he has $1 left ($4 - $3). Therefore, the cost of the candy bar is $3.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 99 bars of chocolate for $3. So, we can write this equation:  $4 - $3 = x, where x is the amount of money left after buying the chocolate. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $3 : $4 - $3 = $x / $3. Now, we multiply both sides of the equation by $3 to eliminate the fraction : $12 = $x. Therefore, there is $12 left over after buying the chocolate.
Response:  If Dan has $3 and buys two chocolate bars for $4, then he spent all of his money ($3) to buy those two chocolate bars. So, each chocolate bar must have cost half of what Dan had left after buying them ($2). Therefore, each chocolate bar costs $2.
Response:  If Dan has $2 and he bought some chocolate bars for $6, then he spent all of his money. So, the number of chocolate bars he bought is equal to the amount of money he had minus the price he paid for them. In this case, that would be: Number of chocolate bars = $2 - $6 = -4 bars. Therefore, Dan bought -4 chocolate bars.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $2 for the bar of chocolate, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he spent $3 for another piece of chocolate, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, there is $2 remaining in Dan's hands.
Response:  We know that Dan has spent $4 to buy something. Then he bought a bar of chocolate for $7 and another piece of candy for $6. So in total, Dan has spent $4 + $7 + $6 = $17. Therefore, Dan has spent $17 to buy the bar of chocolate.
Response:  If Dan has $2 and he bought a chocolate bar for $6, then he spent $6 - $2 = $4 on the chocolate bar.  And if he also bought another chocolate for $3, then he spent an additional $3. So in total, Dan spent $4 + $3 = $7 to buy both chocolates.
Response:  Dan spent $2 to buy the bar of chocolate and $3 to buy the chocolate bar, so he spent a total of $5 + $2 = $7. Therefore, Dan spent more money to buy the chocolate bar than he did for the candy.
Response:  First, Dan had $4. Then he bought a chocolate bar for $8, so now he has $4 - $8 = -$4. But then his friend gave him $5, so now he has $4 + $5 = $9. So, Dan has $9 left.
Response:  If Dan had $4 at the beginning and spent $1 on the candy bar, he would have $3 left ($4 - $1 = $3). So, the cost of the candy bar is $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has spent $4 for something else and he bought 10 bars of chocolate which costs him $3 each. So, he spent $3 x 10 = $30 on buying chocolates. Now, we have to find out how much money is left with Dan after spending this amount. To do this, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial $4 he had. Therefore, the remaining amount with Dan is: $4 - $30 = $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he spent it all on chocolates. So, the total amount of money he spent is $3. Now, we are told that he bought 2 bars of chocolate for the same amount of money. Therefore, the cost of each bar of chocolate is equal to $3 / 2 = $1.50.
Response:  Dan spent $3 for the chocolate and $7 for the barrette, so he has spent a total of $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he has spent $10 to buy a barrette of chocolate.
Response:  Dan spent $7 for the chocolate and $2 for the barrette. So he has spent a total of $9 ( $7 + $2). Therefore, he spent $9 / $4 = $2.25 to buy the chocolate compared to buying the barrette.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 115 books and he sold 78 of them at a garage sale. So, the number of books he has left is:

$$ NumberOfBooksRemaining = TotalNumberOfBooks - SoldAtGarageSale $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ NumberOfBooksRemaining = 115 - 78 $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ NumberOfBooksRemaining = 37 $$

Therefore, Paul has 37 books remaining after selling 78 books at a garage sale."
"Response:  If Paul had initially $X$ books and sold $137$ of them, then he has $X - 137$ books left. Since he now has $105$ books, we can set up the equation:
$$ X - 137 = 105 $$
Solving for $X$, we get:
$$ X = 205 $$
So, Paul had $205$ books at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and after selling some of them he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation:

Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left with Paul

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of books sold = 108 - 62
= 46

Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and then he bought some more at a garage sale. So, let's call the number of books he bought at the garage sale x. Since he now has 151 books, we can write an equation: 50 + x = 151. Solving for x, we get: x = 101. Therefore, Paul bought 101 additional books at the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul had initially 2 books (libri), and he sold some of them in a garage sale, let's call that number x. Then, after selling those books, he bought 150 new ones. So, his current total number of books is 2 + x - 150 = 58. To find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he currently has from the initial number: x = 58 - 2 = 56. Therefore, Paul sold 56 books at the garage sale.
"Response:  If Paul had initially 21 books and sold some of them, let's say he sold x books. Then, after selling those books, he had fewer books than before, so his new number of books is:

$$ N = 21 - x $$

Now, he bought 42 new books, so his updated number of books is:

$$ N = 21 - x + 42 $$

We know that Paul has 15 books now, so we can set up an equation using these values:

$$ 15 = 21 - x + 42 $$

Solving for x, we get:

$$ x = 30 $$

So, Paul sold 30 books originally and then bought 42 new ones. Therefore, he has 15 books left now."
Response:  If Paul had initially 71 books and sold some of them, let's say he sold x books. Then, he bought new ones (38) plus the original ones he still has (71 - x). So, his current number of books is: 71 - x + 38 = 116. Since he sold some books, we know that x > 0, so: 116 = 71 - x + 38. Solving for x, we get: x = 45. Therefore, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 108 books and 55 pens. Then he sold some of them at a garage sale, which reduced his total number to 66 books and 59 pens. To find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the initial number from the final number: 108 - 66 = 42. So, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 106 pencils and 51 books. If he sold some of them at the garage sale, then he has fewer pencils and books now. Specifically, we are told that he has 82 books and 14 pencils left after the sale. So, to find out how many pencils he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of pencils he has left from the initial total: 106 - 14 = 92. Therefore, Paul sold 92 pencils at the garage sale.
Response:  At the beginning, Paul had 136 books. He sold some of them and was left with 27 books. So, he sold 109 books (136 - 27 = 109).
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 134 books and gave 39 to his friend. So he was left with 134 - 39 = 95 books. Then we are told that he sold some of them at a garage sale, which reduced the number of books he had to 68. Therefore, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is equal to 68 - 95 = -27 books. Since negative numbers cannot be sold, the correct answer is 0 books.
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had 153 books and 95 pens. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had:  
$$ \therefore Number\ of\ books\ sold = Initial\ number\ of\ books - Post-sale\ number\ of\ books $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $"
Response:  We know that initially Paolo had 42 pens and 143 books. Then he sold some books and pens at a garage sale, and afterward, he was left with 113 books and 19 pens. So, we can calculate how many pens he sold at the garage sale as follows: Number of pens sold = Total number of pens - Remaining number of pens After selling = 42 - 19 = 23 pens Therefore, Paolo sold 23 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  There were initially 10 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica cut 8 more roses from her garden and put them in the vase. So, there are now 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the vase (Jessica had already cut and placed 16 roses from her garden). Then, Jessica added another 16 roses to the vase she had just filled. So, now there are 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 16 roses in the vase.
Response:  There were initially two roses in the vase (the starting point). Then Jessica threw away four roses from the vase and put new ones from her garden of flowers to replace them (step 1). So there are now 6 roses in the vase (2 + 4 = 6). Finally, she cut more roses from her garden to add to the vase, bringing the total number of roses to 23 (6 + x = 23). Therefore, the answer is x = 17.
Response:  Jessica threw away 33 roses and cut new ones from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now there are 17 roses in the vase. So, she cut 16 more roses than she threw away (33 - 16 = 17). Therefore, she cut 16 additional roses beyond what she threw away.
Response:  Jessica threw away 34 roses and cut new ones from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now there are 15 roses in the vase. So, she threw away 19 more roses than she cut from her garden (34 - 19 = 15). Therefore, she threw away 19 additional roses.
Response:  We know that there were originally 7 roses in the vase and Jessica cut other roses from her garden of 59 flowers in total. So, if we subtract the number of original roses (7) from the total number of flowers she had (59), we get 52. Therefore, Jessica has cut 24 roses (52 - 7 = 24).
Response:  If there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut other roses from her garden that had a total of 12 roses, then the number of roses in the vase increased to 21 roses. To find out how many roses are left in the garden, we need to subtract the number of roses in the vase from the initial number of roses in the garden. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of roses remaining in the garden = Initial number of roses in the garden - Number of roses in the vase = 13 - 21 = -8 roses. So, there are 8 roses left in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden of flowers. After she did this, there were 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before (15) from the number after (17): 17 - 15 = 2. Therefore, Jessica cut 2 roses from her garden of flowers.
Response:  There were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut other roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now there are 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, Jessica has cut 3 orchids (2 - 2 = 3).
Response:  There were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut other roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now there are 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So, there are 7 more roses than orchids in the vase now (12 - 2 = 10). Therefore, there are 7 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  There were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut other roses and orchids from her flower garden. Afterward, there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. So, there are 3 more orchids than roses in the vase (20 - 11 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase.
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses in the vase and Jessica cut 16 more from her garden of flowers to put in the vase, then she has cut a total of 16 + 3 = 19 roses. Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut other roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now, there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before (13) from the number of roses after (14): 14 - 13 = 1. Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose from her flower garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. After she did this, there were 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of orchids before (3) from the number after (7). Therefore, Jessica cut 4 orchids.
Response:  There were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut other roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, there are 2 more roses than orchids in the vase now. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. So, after she did this, there are 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses there are, we need to subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers (orchids + roses). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of orchids in excess = Total number of flowers - Number of roses = 13 + 3 - 9 = 7
"Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some centimeters of her hair, then it is now 13 inches long. To find out how many centimeters she cut off, we can use the following calculation:

Difference = New length - Original length
= 13 - 17
= -4

So, Robin cut off 4 centimeters of her hair."
"Response:  If Robin cut off 20 centimeters of his hair and now they are 10 inches long, we can calculate how many years old he was before cutting them as follows:

10 inches = 25.4 centimeters (conversion factor)

So, if Robin had 20 centimeters of hair before cutting them, that means he had 20 / 25.4 = 0.8 feet of hair before cutting.

Now, to find out how old Robin was before cutting his hair, we need to convert the length of hair from feet to years:

1 foot = 12 months (approximately)

Therefore, 0.8 feet = 9.6 months (rounded up to the nearest month).

So, Robin was approximately 9.6 months old when he cut off 20 centimeters of his hair."
Response:  Firstly, Robin had long hair that was 16 inches (40 cm) in length. Then she cut it by 15 centimeters (6 inches). So her new length would be 16 - 15 = 1 inch (2.5 cm). Finally, after growing again for 12 inches (30 cm), Robin's hair is now 1 + 12 = 13 inches (33 cm) long. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 13 inches (33 cm) long.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long and it grew by 18 inches, then her new length would be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long.
Response:  If Robin had 14 inches of hair at the beginning and cut off 13 inches, then she has 1 inch left now. So, her hair is currently 14 - 1 = 13 inches long.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 45 cm long and grew by 8 inches (which is equal to 20.32 cm), then it would be:  Hair length = Original length + Growth = 45 cm + 20.32 cm = 65.32 cm So, Robin's hair is now 65.32 cm long.
Response:  If Danny has 12 bottles in his collection and he found 53 caps in the park, then he now has 65 caps (12 + 53).
Response:  If Danny has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he found 53 more at the park, then the total number of bottle caps he has now is: 21 + 53 = 74. Therefore, Danny has 74 bottle caps in total.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 63 new caps and thrown away 51 old ones. So he now has 33 caps left. To find out how many caps Danny had at the beginning, we can use the information that he threw away 51 old caps. If he had x caps at the beginning, then he threw away 51 - x caps. Therefore, the number of caps Danny had at the beginning is:  x = 33 + 51 - 63 = 20  So, Danny had 20 caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 22 new caps and he threw away 35 old ones. So, the total number of caps he had is :  New = 22 + Old = 35 - 35 = 0. Therefore, Danny found no new caps at the park. 
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 30 caps from the park and he has thrown away 63 old ones. So, the total number of caps he has is: 30 + (63 - 30) = 53. Now we are told that he has 42 caps in his collection. Therefore, the number of caps he threw away beyond those found at the park is: 53 - 42 = 11.
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 tappi of bottles and 8 involucri in the park. So he had a total of 22 + 8 = 30 items. Then, he found more tappi and involucri and added them to his collection. He got 28 tappi and 63 involucri, so he now has a total of 30 (initial amount) + 28 (new tappi) + 63 (new involucri) = 111 items. Therefore, Danny had 111 tappi at the beginning.
Response:  At first, Danny had 30 involucri. Then he found 22 more tappi of bottles and collected them. So now he has 57 involucri in his collection. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 30 - 22 = 8 involucri.
Response:  At first, Danny found 30 caps of bottles at the park. Then he collected 7 more caps from his collection, so he has 30 + 7 = 37 caps in total. Similarly, he found 14 involucrum at the park and collected 86 more from his collection, so he has 14 + 86 = 100 involucrum in total. Therefore, there are 37 - 30 = 7 more caps than those that Danny found at the park.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 11 caps and 28 labels from the park initially. Then he found 6 more caps and 34 more labels at the park, so he now has 68 caps and 51 labels in his collection. Therefore, the total number of caps and labels Danny found at the park is 11 + 6 = 17 caps and 28 + 34 = 62 labels.
Response:  At first, Danny had 71 caps and 24 labels. Then he found 28 more caps and 16 more labels. So, at this point, Danny has 71 + 28 = 99 caps and 24 + 16 = 40 labels. Therefore, Danny now has 99 - 71 = 28 more caps than he initially had, and 40 - 24 = 16 more labels than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Danny had 62 involucri at first and then he found 10 more taps of bottles. So, now he has 72 (62 + 10) involucri. Then, he collected 27 new taps of bottles, which means he gained 27 - 10 = 17 additional involucri. Therefore, Danny currently has 72 + 17 = 89 involucri in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 tappi of bottles at the park and he lost 66 tappi. So, now he has 25 tappi of bottles. To find out how many tappi Danny had initially, we need to subtract the number of tappi he lost from the total number of tappi he had: 66 - 66 = 0. Therefore, Danny had 0 tappi of bottles at the beginning.
Response:  Before going to the park, Danny had 25 tappi of bottle in his collection. After finding 32 taps at the park, he now has a total of 57 tappi (25 + 32). Therefore, Danny found 9 tappi of bottle at the park (32 - 25 = 9).
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 67 taps of bottles and he threw away 60 old ones while finding 58 new ones. So, if we subtract the number of old ones thrown away from the total number of taps found (including both old and new), we get:  67 - 60 = 7  Therefore, Danny had 7 taps of bottles at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny has thrown away 6 old caps and found 50 new ones. So he now has 60 caps in total. To find out how many more caps he found than threw away, we can subtract the number of caps he threw away from the total number of caps he has:  60 - 6 = 54 Therefore, Danny found 54 additional caps at the park beyond those he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 52 taps of bottles and he has thrown away 54 old ones. So, the number of new taps he found at the park is equal to the number of old taps he threw away minus the number of new taps he collected.  Therefore, the answer is: 54 - 52 = 2.
Response:  At first, Danny had 42 tappi of bottles (since he now has 42 tappi and 61 involucri).  So, initially, Danny had 42 - 82 = 40 tappi of bottles.
Response:  At first, Danny had 68 involucri and 0 tappi of bottles. Then he found 39 tappi of bottles and added them to his collection. So, now he has 68 + 39 = 107 involucri. Later, he collected 16 more tappi of bottles, so he has 107 - 16 = 91 involucri left. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 91 involucri.
Response:  We know that Danny found 50 tappi and 46 involucri at the park. So he had 50 + 46 = 96 items initially. Now we are told that he has 21 tappi and 52 involucri in his collection. Therefore, the difference between the number of tappi he found at the park and the number of tappi he now has is:  21 - 50 = -29 tappi. Similarly, the difference between the number of involucri he found at the park and the number of involucri he now has is:  52 - 46 = 6 involucri. So there are 29 more tappi than involucri in Danny's collection.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 65 involucri and 5 tappi of bottles in the park initially. Then he found 31 more taps and 9 more involucri in his collection. So, the total number of taps and involucri that Danny found at the park is: 65 + 31 = 96 taps and 5 + 9 = 14 involucri. Therefore, the answer to the question is 96 + 14 = 110.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 58 caps and 25 labels. Then he found 11 more caps and 12 more labels in his collection. So, the total number of caps he has now is 58 + 11 = 69. Similarly, the total number of labels he has now is 25 + 12 = 37. Therefore, Danny has 69 caps and 37 labels in his collection now.
"Response:  We know that initially Danny had 15 caps and 18 labels in the park. Then he found 67 more labels and 35 more caps in his collection. So, the total number of labels he has now is:  
$$ \text {Initially} = 15 + 67 = 82 $$
Similarly, the total number of caps he has now is:  
$$ \text{Initially} = 18 + 35 = 53 $$
Therefore, Danny now has $ 82$ labels and $ 53 $ caps in his collection."
Response:  If Jake has 11 fewer fish than Steven, then Steven must have 17 + 11 = 28 fish. So, Steven has 28 fish.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer fish than Steven, who has more fish than Jill. So, if we start with Jake and subtract the number of fish he has from the total number of fish Steven has, we can find out how many fish Jake has.  Therefore, Jake has 7 - 15 = -8 fish.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 fish less than Steven, who has 19 fish. So, if we subtract 18 from 19, we get: 19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, Jill has 1 fish.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer fish than Steven, so he must have 3 + 5 = 8 fish more than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 8 - 3 = 5 fish more than Jill.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fish less than Steven, so he must have 12 + x fish where x is the number of fish Steven has. Since Steven has 4 fish more than Jill, we can write:
Jake = 12 + x
Steven = Jake - 4
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
12 + x = Jake - 4
Solving for x, we find that Jill has 8 fish more than Jake:
x = 8
Therefore, Jill has 8 + 12 = 20 fish in more than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer fish than Steven and 9 more fish than Jill. So if Steven has 16 fish, then Jake has:

Jake = Steven - 7 + 9 = 10

Therefore, Jake has 10 fish."
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer fish than Steven and 8 more fish than Jill. So if Steven has 17 fish, then Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 fish. And if Jake has 10 fish, then Jill has 10 + 8 = 18 fish. Therefore, Jill has 18 fish.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer fish than Steven and 18 more than Jill. So, if we write down what we know about each person's number of fish:
Jake - 9 fewer = x (where x is the number of fish Steven has)
Steven - 16 + x (where x is the number of fish Jill has)
We can now use substitution to solve for x:
x = 16 + 9 = 25
So, Steven has 25 fish in more than Jill."
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer fish than Steven. So if Steven has x fish, Jake has x - 6 = 4 fish. Now we are told that Steven has 18 more fish than Jill. So if Jill has y fish, Steven has y + 18 = 26 fish. Therefore, Jake has 4 fish and Steven has 26 fish.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer fish than Steven (5 vs 18). So, if Jake had x fish, then Steven would have x + 13 fish (since he has 18 - 5 = 13 more fish than Jake). Now we are told that Jill has 87 fish. Since Jill has more fish than both Jake and Steven, we can say that Jake has x/2 fish and Steven has x/2 + 13 fish. Therefore, Jake has 5/2 = 3 fish.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 fewer fish than Steven, so Steven has 16 + 16 = 32 fish.  We also know that Steven has 15 more fish than Jill, so Jill has 15 - 15 = 0 fish. Therefore, Jill has no fish at all.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer peaches than Steven. So, if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x + 12 peaches.  Moreover, we know that Steven has more melons than Jake. Therefore, if Steven has y melons, then Jake has y - 79 melons.  Now, let's substitute these values into the equation:  x + (x + 12) = y - 79  Simplifying the equation: 2x + 12 = y - 79  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2x = y - 91  Dividing both sides by 2: x = y / 2  So, Jake has half of the number of peaches that Steven has. Since Steven has 19 peches, Jake has 9 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer fish than Steven and 3 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has 9 fish and 8 apples, then Jake has 9 - 13 = 4 fish less than Steven and 8 + 3 = 11 apples more than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 4 fish and 11 apples more than Steven.  So, Jake has 15 apples (4 + 11).
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer fish than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven. So, if we write down what we know about Jake:
Jake has x fish (less 6 = 4).
Jake has y apples (more 8 = 10).
Now, let's find out how many fish Steven has:
Steven has 17 + 4 = 21 fish.
And how many apples Steven has:
Steven has 16 + 10 = 26 apples.
So, to summarize:
Jake has 4 fish less than Steven and 10 apples more than Steven. Therefore, Steven has 4 + 10 = 14 more fish and apples than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer fish than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if we write down what we know about Jake:
Jake has 3 fewer fish than Steven = -3 fish
Jake has 10 more apples than Steven = +10 apples
Now, let's find out how many apples Steven has:
Steven has 12 fish and 15 apples = 12 + 15 = 27 apples
So, Steven has 27 apples in total. Now, let's calculate how many apples Steven has in addition to his fish:
Adding the number of apples Steven has to the number of fish he has, we get:
27 (apples) + 12 (fish) = 39
Therefore, Steven has 39 apples in addition to his 12 fish."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 fish and Jill has 67 more than Jake. So, if Jake has x fish, then we can write an equation as follows:  Steven has 12 fish, Jill has 67 + x fish, and Jake has x - 12 fish. Now, let's solve for x (the number of fish Jake has).  Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:  Jake has x = 50 fish. Therefore, Jake has 50 fish.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 fish and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, Jake must have 18 - x fish where x is the number of fish Jill has. Now we are given that Jill has 8 more fish than Jake, so Jill has (18 - x) + 8 = 26 fish. Therefore, Jill has 26 fish.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 19 fish and Jill has 72 more than Jake. So, if Jake has x fish, then we can write an equation as follows:

Steven has 19 fish
Jill has 72 + x fish

Now, let's solve for x (the number of fish Jake has):

Subtracting 19 from both sides gives us:

72 + x = 91

Subtracting 72 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

Therefore, Jake has 19 fish."
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 fish and Jake has 6 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 fish.  We also know that Jill has 3 more fish than Jake, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 fish. Therefore, Jill has 11 fish.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 10 fish and fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract 10 from Jake's total number of fish, we will get his actual number of fish. Therefore, Jake has 74 fish (84 - 10).
Response:  We know that Steven has 8 pesche and 12 mele. So, if we subtract 8 from 12, we get -4. This means that Jake has 4 more mele than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 13 + 4 = 17 mele.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer fish than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if we write down what we know about Jake:
Jake has 8 - 10 = -2 apples less than Steven.
And we know that Steven has 11 + 18 = 39 fish more than Jake.
So, to find out how many more fish Steven has than Jake, we can subtract the number of apples Jake has from the total number of fish Steven has:
Steven has 39 - (-2) = 41 more fish than Jake.
Therefore, Steven has 41 more fish than Jake."
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer fish than Steven and 4 more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract 3 from Steven's number of fish (19), we get Jake's number of fish (16). Then, since Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, we add 4 to Steven's number of apples (15) to get Jake's number of apples (19). Therefore, Steven has 15 - 3 = 12 apples in excess of his fish.
"Response:  If there were $78 in Olivia's wallet and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then...

$78 - $15 = $63

So, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet."
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and is left with $33, then she must have had $101 initially ( $33 + $78 = $101).
Response:  If there were $100 in Olivia's wallet and she withdrew $148 from an ATM, then there would be $24 ($100 - $148) left in her wallet after the withdrawal.  After visiting the grocery store, there are $159 remaining in her wallet. Therefore, the amount spent at the grocery store is $135 ($159 - $24).
Response:  We know that there were $3 in Olivia's wallet and she withdrew $49 from an ATM. After visiting the grocery store, there were only $49 left. So, how much more money did she collect at the ATM than she spent at the grocery store? $$$$$ = $49 - $49 = $0 $$$. Therefore, she didn't collect any more money at the ATM than she spent at the grocery store.
Response:  We know that there were originally $53 in Olivia's wallet and she withdrew $91 from an ATM. So, the total amount of money she had was $53 + $91 = $144. Then, after visiting the grocery store, she spent some money and there were only $14 left in her wallet. Therefore, the difference between the amount she spent at the grocery store and the amount she withdrew from the ATM is equal to the original amount she had minus the amount she spent at the grocery store, which is: $144 - $14 = $130. So, Olivia spent $130 more than she withdrew from the ATM at the grocery store.
Response:  We know that there were initially $106 in Olivia's wallet and after visiting the supermarket, she had $75 left. Then, she went to the showroom where she spent $49. So, the amount of money she had left after buying something at the showroom is: $75 - $49 = $26. Therefore, Olivia spent $49 at the showroom.
Response:  At the beginning, there were $54 in the wallet. After Olivia visited the grocery store and spent $29, there were $25 left ($54 - $29 = $25). Therefore, Olivia spent $29 at the grocery store.
Response:  If Olivia had $128 at the beginning and she spent $38, then she has $90 left: $128 - $38 = $90.
Response:  If Dave had 19 apps on his phone and he cancelled 5 of them, then he has 14 apps left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
"Response:  At first, Dave had x apps on his phone. After canceling 18 of them, he was left with y apps. Since there are now 5 apps remaining, we can set up the equation:
x = y + 18
Now, solve for x:
x = y + 18
Subtract 18 from both sides:
x = y
So, at the beginning, Dave had y apps on his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 apps on his phone initially and then added 11 new ones. So, the total number of apps he had was 10 + 11 = 21. Then, he cancelled some apps, leaving him with 4 apps remaining. Therefore, the number of apps he cancelled is equal to 21 - 4 = 17.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 apps on his phone initially and then added 89 new ones. So, the total number of apps he had after adding the new ones is:

21 + 89 = 106

Now, we are told that he cancelled some apps, so let's find out how many he cancelled:

""After having cancelled some, there were 24 left.""

So, the number of apps he cancelled is:

106 - 24 = 82

Therefore, Dave added 89 new apps and cancelled 82 apps."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 apps on his phone initially and then added 71 new ones. So, the total number of apps he had after adding the new ones is:

15 + 71 = 86

Now, we are asked how many apps he cancelled. The question states that ""After having canceled some, there were 14 left."" So, the number of apps he cancelled is:

86 - 14 = 72

Therefore, Dave cancelled 72 apps."
"Response:  We know that Dave had initially 16 apps and 77 files on his phone. After canceling some of them, he was left with 5 apps and 23 files. So, to find out how many apps Dave canceled, we need to subtract the number of apps he had after canceling from the initial number of apps he had. In this case, the difference is:  
$ 16 - 5 = $ 11 $  Therefore, Dave canceled 11 apps."
Response:  At first, Dave had 21 files and 17 apps on his phone. Then he cancelled some apps and files, so he had 3 apps left and 7 files left. To find out how many files he cancelled, we need to subtract the number of files he had after cancellation from the total number of files he initially had:  Number of files cancelled = Total number of files - Number of files after cancellation = 21 - 7 = 14 files. Therefore, Dave cancelled 14 files.
"Response:  At first, Dave had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone. After canceling some apps and files, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files. So, the number of apps that Dave left on his phone is:

$$ \boxed{15 - 7 = 8} $$

Therefore, Dave left 8 apps on his phone after canceling some."
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone. Then he cancelled some of them, so he was left with 6 apps and 15 files. Therefore, he has 9 files (18 - 15 = 9) left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 apps on his phone and after adding some more he was left with 18 apps, then we can say that he added 1 app to his phone. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 59 files and 15 apps on his phone. After canceling some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So, to find out how many apps Dave canceled, we need to subtract the number of apps he had after canceling from the initial number of apps he had. Therefore, the answer is: Apps canceled = Initial apps - Post-canceling apps = 15 - 12 = 3.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 files and 13 apps on his phone. If he cancelled some apps and files, then he has 17 apps and 21 files left. To find out how many files he cancelled, we need to subtract the number of files he had after cancellation from the initial number of files he had. So, the answer is: Number of files cancelled = Initial number of files - Number of files after cancellation = 24 - 21 = 3.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. Then he cancelled some apps and files, leaving him with 5 files and 12 apps. So, the number of apps that Dave left on his phone is: 12 - 9 = 3.
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. Then he cancelled some apps and files, so he was left with 24 files and 2 apps. Therefore, he has left 21 files (24 - 3 = 21) on his phone after cancelling some apps and files.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards in total and gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate how many cards Nell has left as follows:

Nell's remaining cards = Total number of cards - Number given to Jeff
= 242 - 136
= 106

Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left."
Response:  At first, Nell had 301 cards. Then she gave 301 of them to Jeff. So now she has 301 - 301 = 0 cards left. Therefore, at the beginning, Nell had 0 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, we can say that Jeff got x number of cards from Nell. Since Jeff only had 11 cards initially, we can conclude that x = 517 (the difference between Nell's original number of cards and Jeff's initial number). Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 517 cards.
Response:  First, we know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer cards now than before. Let's call the number of cards she has after giving some to Jeff x. Then, we know that Jeff started with 234 cards and got some from Nell, so he has x + 234 cards now. Since Nell has 535 cards left, we can set up the equation: x + 234 = 535. Solving for x, we get: x = 301. Therefore, Jeff has 301 cards now.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards initially and gave some to Jeff. So, after giving some to Jeff, she had fewer than 309 cards left. Then we are told that she now has 415 baseball cards in total (including the ones she got from Jeff). Therefore, the number of baseball cards Nell had before giving any to Jeff is equal to the difference between her current total and the number of cards she gave to Jeff:

Number of baseball cards Nell had before giving any to Jeff = Total number of baseball cards - Number of cards given to Jeff
= 415 - 356
= 69
So, Nell had 69 baseball cards before giving any to Jeff."
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 cards of baseball and gave some to Jeff. So, after giving them away, she has 404 - 246 = 158 cards of baseball left. Now, we are asked how many more cards of 10 than those of baseball does Nell have. The difference between 495 (the total number of cards of 10) and 158 is equal to the number of cards of 10 that Nell has more than the number of cards of baseball she has. Therefore, the answer is 495 - 158 = 337 cards of 10 more than the number of cards of baseball.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave some to both John and Jeff.  She gave 195 cards to John and still has more than she gave to him. So, she must have given less to Jeff than she did to John. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of cards (573) and the number she gave to John (195). Thus, Nell gave 378 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 cards of baseball and she gave some to Jeff. So, after giving some to Jeff, she has fewer cards than before.  Now we are told that she has 55 cards of ten and 178 cards of baseball. This means that she must have had 263 cards of baseball before giving any to Jeff (55 + 178 = 233). Therefore, the number of cards of baseball that Nell had initially is 233 - 438 = -205.  So, Nell had -205 cards of baseball initially.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 cards of baseball and gave some to Jeff. So, she now has 376 cards of 10 and 111 cards of baseball. To find out how many more cards of 10 than baseball cards she has, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards:  Number of cards of 10 = Total number of cards - Number of cards of baseball  Number of cards of 10 = 376 - 111 = 265 Therefore, Nell has 265 more cards of 10 than baseball cards.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 19 biscotti and there are now 35 remaining, that means he started with an initial number of biscotti equal to 35 minus the number he ate (19). So, the answer is: 35 - 19 = 16. Therefore, Paco initially had 16 biscotti.
Response:  If Paco has eaten some of the biscuits and there are now 7 left, then he must have eaten at least 7 - x biscuits, where x is the number he had initially (in this case, 28). So, Paco must have eaten 21 biscuits (28 - 7 = 21).
Response:  Paco has eaten 2 biscuits out of 40 (he has left 38). Then he buys 37 more biscuits. So, in total, he has bought 37 + 2 = 39 biscuits. Now, he has eaten 2 biscuits and has 39 - 2 = 37 biscuits remaining.
Response:  Paco has eaten 25 biscotti initially and then he has eaten 5 more. So, the total number of biscotti he has eaten is 25 + 5 = 30. Now, he has bought 3 more biscotti. Therefore, the total number of biscotti that Paco has eaten in addition to those he bought is 3 (the ones he bought) + 30 (the ones he already had) = 33.
Response:  Paco has eaten 2 biscuits, so he has 13 - 2 = 11 biscuits left. Then, he buys 36 more biscuits. So, the total number of biscuits he bought is 11 + 36 = 47 biscuits. Therefore, he bought 47 - 11 = 36 more biscuits than he ate.
Response:  Paco has eaten 5 biscotti and given 13 to his friend. So, he has left (40 - 5 =) 35 biscotti.
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 biscuits in total. He has given 13 to his friend, so he has 17 - 13 = 4 more biscuits than those he gave away. Therefore, Paco has eaten 4 more biscuits than his friend.
Response:  Paco has eaten 12 biscuits and given 21 to his friend. So, he has 9 (12 - 21) more biscuits than his friend. Therefore, Paco gave 9 more biscuits to his friend than he had eaten himself.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 22 sweet cookies and 75 savory ones, that means he has eaten a total of 97 cookies (22 + 75).  Now, if he has eaten 15 sweet cookies since then, that means he has left 82 sweet cookies (97 - 15). Similarly, if he has eaten 54 savory cookies since then, that means he has left 21 savory cookies (75 - 54). Therefore, Paco has left 82 sweet cookies and 21 savory cookies.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 9 sweet biscuits and 6 savory biscuits in total. So far, he has eaten a total of 9 + 6 = 15 biscuits. Now we are told that he has also eaten 36 sweet biscuits. This means that he has left behind 36 - 15 = 21 sweet biscuits. Since he did not eat any savory biscuits after eating the initial 6, he must have left behind all 6 savory biscuits as well. Therefore, the number of savory biscuits left for Paco is 6.
Response:  Paco has eaten 37 sweet biscuits and 11 savory biscuits for a total of 48 biscuits. He then ate 5 more sweet biscuits and 2 more savory biscuits, bringing the total to 50 biscuits. So, in addition to the savory biscuits, Paco has eaten 3 more sweet biscuits than he has eaten savory biscuits. Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet biscuits Paco has eaten and the number of savory biscuits he has eaten is 3.
Response:  If Paco has eaten more savory than sweet biscuits, then he must have eaten at least as many savory biscuits as he has eaten sweet biscuits. So if he has eaten 8 sweet biscuits and 6 salty ones, that means he has eaten 8 + 6 = 14 biscuits in total. Therefore, he has eaten 14 - 8 = 6 more salty biscuits than sweet biscuits.
Response:  If Paco had 37 biscotti at the beginning and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 biscotto left. So, the number of biscotti that Paco has left is 1.
Response:  Paco has eaten 10 biscotti and given away 14 biscotti. So, he has left behind 30 - (10 + 14) = 30 - 28 = 2 biscotti. Therefore, Paco has left behind 2 biscotti.
Response:  Paco has eaten 41 biscuits in total. He gave 9 biscuits to his friend, so he had 32 biscuits left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 more biscuits, so he has eaten a total of 50 biscuits (32 + 18 = 50). Therefore, Paco has eaten 9 more biscuits than he gave away (50 - 9 = 41).
Response:  Paco has given his friend 30 biscuits and he has eaten 23 of them. So, if we subtract the number of biscuits that Paco has eaten from the total number of biscuits given to his friend, we get:  30 - 23 = 7. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 7 more biscuits than he ate himself.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 97 biscotti salati and 34 biscotti dolci, then he has left 63 biscotti salati (97 - 34 = 63).  Therefore, Paco has left 63 biscotti dolci (15 + 56 = 71).
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 26 biscotti salati and 17 biscotti dolci in total. So he has left 26 - 17 = 9 biscotti salati.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 39 biscotti dolci and 6 salati. So he has eaten a total of 39 + 6 = 45 biscuits. Now we are asked how many more biscotti dolci than salati he has eaten. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of salati from the number of dolci. Therefore, the difference between the number of biscotti dolci and salati is: 45 - 6 = 39. So, Paco has eaten 39 more biscotti dolci than salati.
Response:  Paco has taken 40 biscotti in total (dolci and salati). He has eaten 28 of them, so he still has 12 left. Then, he has also taken 25 salati, which means he has eaten 15 of them (since he started with 25), leaving him with 10 salati left. Now, let's check how many biscotti he ate more than the salati:  Biscotti = 28 (eaten) Salati = 15 (eaten) + 10 (left) = 25 So, Paco ate more biscotti than salati by 3 (28 - 25 = 3).
Response:  If she received $7 for her birthday and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $2 ($7 - $5 = $2).
Response:  If Gwen received $10 for her birthday and spent $8 of it, then she has $2 left ($10 - $8 = $2). So, Gwen received $10 for her birthday.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mother and then her father gave her $4 more. So she had a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she would have $3 left. Therefore, Gwen had $3 still in her possession after spending money.
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father, so she has a total of $13. If she spends $4, then she will have $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, Gwen received more money from her mother than she did from her father.
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spends $4, then she will have $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). Therefore, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother did.
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and then her mother gave her $7 more. So she has a total of $12. Then she spent $4, so she is left with $8. Therefore, Gwen received $8 more from her mother than she did from her father.
Response:  If she received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, then in total she has $7 (5 + 2).  If she spends $6, that means she will have $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, she received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  If Josh had 9 balls in his collection and lost some of them, he now has 4 balls left. So, he must have lost 5 balls (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had x bigliette in his collection and lost 21 of them, then he has x - 21 bigliette left. Since he now has 12 bigliette, we can set up the equation: x = 12. Solving for x, we get that Josh originally had 12 + 21 = 33 bigliette in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 bigli...
Response:  If Josh had 4 bigli in his collection and lost 16, then he had 4 - 16 = -12 bigli. But if he found 8 new ones, that means he gained 8 + 8 = 16 bigli. So, he actually lost more than he found. Therefore, the answer is -12.
Response:  If Josh had 7 biglies in his collection and lost 8 of them, he would have left with 7 - 8 = -1 bigly.  Then, he found 10 new biglies, so he now has 7 + 10 = 17 biglies in total. Therefore, he found 17 - 8 = 9 more biglies than he lost.
Response:  If Josh had 21 biglietti in his collection and he found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 biglietti left in his collection. So, he has 14 biglietti now.
Response:  Josh had 20 bigli in his collection and gave two to Jack. So now he has 20 - 2 = 18 bigli left.
Response:  Josh had 22 biglies in his collection and then Jack gave him 20 biglies. So, now Josh has 20 + 22 = 42 biglies.
Response:  If Josh had 19 biglies in his collection and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 biglies left (19 - 11 = 8).
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 bigli (bills) in his collection. Then he found 13 more bills, so now he has 22 + 13 = 35 bigli. However, he lost 5 bigli, so he has 35 - 5 = 30 bigli left in his collection. Therefore, Josh currently has 30 bigli in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 bigli in his collection and found 9 more, then he has now 24 bigli (15 + 9 = 24).  However, if he lost 23 bigli, then he is left with only one biglia (24 - 23 = 1). So, the number of bigli that Josh lost is equal to 22 bigli (23 - 1 = 22).
Response:  If Josh had 3 bigli in his collection and found 6 more, then he now has 3 + 6 = 9 bigli. However, he lost 5 bigli, so he actually has 9 - 5 = 4 bigli left. Therefore, Josh found 4 bigli that he did not have before.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 4 kg of strawberries. Then we are told that Marco's strawberries alone weighed 9 kg. So, if we subtract the weight of his father's strawberries from the total weight of all their strawberries, we get:  9 kg - 4 kg = 5 kg. Therefore, Marco's strawberries were 5 kg heavier than those of his father.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 35 kg of strawberries. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 4 kg, we can calculate how much his father's strawberries weighed as follows:

Father's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's strawberries
= 35 kg - 4 kg
= 31 kg

Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's strawberries is 31 kg."
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father collected 20 kg of strawberries. Since his father's strawberries weighed 5 kg, then Marco's strawberries must have weighed 15 kg (20 - 5).
Response:  We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 8 kg (chili), while his father's strawberries weighed 32 kg (chili). So together, their strawberries weigh 40 kg (chili).
Response:  We know that Marco lost 5 kg of strawberries, so he had 5 kg - 5 kg = 0 kg of strawberries left. His father also collected strawberries with him, but we don't know how much his father collected. However, since Marco only lost 5 kg of strawberries, it means that his father must have collected at least 5 kg of strawberries more than Marco did. Therefore, the weight of the strawberries collected by Marco's father is equal to 5 kg + x kg, where x is a positive integer greater than 0. Since the total weight of all the strawberries collected by both Marco and his father together is equal to 1 kg + (x + 5) kg, we can set up the equation: 1 kg + (x + 5) kg = 2 kg + 5 kg = 7 kg. Solving for x, we get: x = 4 kg. So, the weight of the strawberries collected by Marco's father is 4 kg.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 10 chili of strawberries. Then, his father lost 2 chili of strawberries. So, Marco had 10 - 2 = 8 chili of strawberries left. Now, we are asked how much did his father have left. Therefore, the weight of the strawberries his father had left is equal to the weight of the strawberries Marco had left minus the weight of the strawberries he originally had. That is, 8 - 10 = -2 chili. Thus, his father had -2 chili of strawberries left.
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father together collected 22 kg of strawberries. Then, when they returned home, Marco's father found additional 30 kg of strawberries. So, in total, Marco's father now has 52 kg (22 + 30) of strawberries.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 37 kg of strawberries. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 5 kg, we can conclude that his father's strawberries weighed 32 kg (37 - 5).
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 30 kg of strawberries. If their combined weight was 17 kg, then the weight of Marco's strawberries is:

$ \therefore $ Marco's strawberries weighed 30 - 17 = 13 kg more than his father's strawberries."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 26 kg of strawberries. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 5 kg, we can conclude that his father's strawberries weighed 21 kg (26 - 5 = 21).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 30 kg of strawberries.  Since Marco's father's strawberries weighed 5 kg, then Marco's strawberries must have weighed 25 kg (30 - 5).
Response:  At first, there were 5 children on the bus. Then, other children got on the bus at the stop, so there are now 10 children on the bus altogether. Therefore, there are 5 + 5 = 10 more children on the bus after the stop compared to before it.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children on the bus. Then, 38 more children got on the bus at the next stop. So, in total, there are now 26 + 38 = 64 children on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were some children on the bus. Then, at the stop, two more children got on the bus. So, initially, there were 41 children on the bus. Therefore, before the stop, there were 39 children on the bus (since 2 new children joined).
Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children on the bus. Then, some of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left on the bus is 21. To find out how many children got off the bus, we need to subtract the number of children left on the bus from the initial number of children. Therefore, 43 - 21 = 22 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children on the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop. So, the number of children left on the bus is 41 - x, where x is the number of children who got off. Now, there are 18 children left on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off is 18 - x. Solving for x, we get x = 23. Thus, there were 41 children on the bus before they got off.
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children on the bus. Then, 10 children got off at the stop, leaving 11 children still on the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus is 10. Therefore, the number of children who remained on the bus after they got off is 11 - 10 = 1. Hence, there are 16 children on the bus in total (including those who got off).
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children on the bus. Then, at the next stop, 63 children got off the bus while 20 children got on the bus. So, the total number of children on the bus after this stop is:  Initially: 5 Children + Those who got on the bus: 20 Children = Total Number of Children on Bus After Stop: 25 Children Now, we are asked how many more children boarded the bus than got off the bus. To find out, we need to subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children on the bus after the stop:  Subtracting the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children on the bus after the stop gives us: 25 - 63 = -38 Children Therefore, there were 38 more children who boarded the bus than got off the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 36 children on the bus. Then, 68 children got off the bus, leaving 12 children on it. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who got on the bus plus the number of children who remained on the bus. Therefore, the answer is 60 (68 - 12).
Response:  At first, there were 22 children on the bus. Then, 40 children got off the bus and 2 children got on the bus. So, at the next stop, there were 64 children (22 + 40 - 2) on the bus. Finally, 2 children got off the bus, leaving 62 children inside. Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the last stop (62 - 2).
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children on the bus and then 82 children got on the bus while some got off. So, the total number of children on the bus at the end is: 28 + (82 - 30) = 150 children. Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus in more than those who got off are 150 - 28 = 122 children.
Response:  At first, there were 23 children on the bus. Then, 24 children got off the bus and 8 children got on the bus. So, initially, there were 23 - 24 = -1 child on the bus. Later, when 8 children got on the bus, there were 8 + (-1) = 7 children on the bus. Therefore, 7 children got off the bus in more than the number of children who got on the bus (8).
Response:  If the baker has made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them, that means he has left 82 unsolved (133 - 51 = 82). So, the baker has made 82 more tarts than those he has sold. Therefore, the number of tarts the baker has made is equal to 82 + 51 = 133.
Response:  If the baker has sold some of the 54 tarts, then he must have had more than 13 left at the end. So if he has sold x tarts, he will be left with 54 - x tarts. Since he has 13 tarts left, we can set up the equation: 54 - x = 13. Solving for x, we get: x = 41. Therefore, the baker has sold 41 tarts.
Response:  If the baker has sold 145 tarts and he still has 72 left, then he must have made 217 tarts in total (145 + 72 = 217).
Response:  If the baker has made 155 tarts and his friend bought him 140 tarts, then he still has 15 - (140-155) = 10 tarts left. Therefore, the baker would have 10 tarts remaining.
Response:  The baker has made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, so he still has 16 (121 - 105) tarts left. Then, he bought 170 new ones, so now he has 36 (16 + 170) tarts in total. Therefore, the baker has 36 tarts left.
Response:  The baker has sold 9 tarts and bought 154 new ones. So he has 163 tarts (9 + 154). Therefore, he has 163 - 9 = 154 tarts left.
Response:  The baker has sold 78 tarts and bought 31 new ones. So he has sold more than he has bought. In particular, he has sold 47 more tarts (78 - 31 = 47).
Response:  The baker has already made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. So he still has 35 tarts left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he makes another 76 tarts. So now he has 35 + 76 = 111 tarts in total.
Response:  The baker has made a total of 144 tarts and sold 71. This means that he still has 73 tarts left (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made additional 111 tarts. So, in total, he has made 284 tarts (73 + 111 = 284). Therefore, the number of tarts that the baker has made beyond those he sold is 204 (284 - 71 = 204).
Response:  The baker has made 149 tarts and 91 mini cakes. If he sells 10 tarts and 90 mini cakes, then he will have 139 tarts left (149 - 10 = 139). So, the baker will have 139 tarts still available for sale.
Response:  The baker has made 7 tarts and 148 cannoli. If he sells 15 tarts and 103 cannoli, then he will have 7 + 148 - 15 = 126 remaining cannoli.
Response:  We know that the baker has made a total of 126 tarts and 48 cannoli. If he sold 115 tarts and 81 cannoli, then we have to find out how many more tarts he made than what he sold. So, the difference between the number of tarts he made and the number of tarts he sold is equal to the number of additional tarts he made. Therefore, the answer is 31 (126 - 115 = 31).
"Response:  The baker made 19 tarts and 131 puff pastry rolls. If he sold 70 tarts and 88 puff pastry rolls, then we need to find out how many more puff pastry rolls he sold than he made. We can do this by subtracting the number of puff pastry rolls he made from the number of puff pastry rolls he sold:

Number of puff pastry rolls sold = 88 - 131 = -43
So, the baker sold 43 fewer puff pastry rolls than he made."
Response:  We know that the baker has sold 158 tortes and 147 pasticcini. So, if he had made 157 tortes and 169 pasticcini in total, then he must have sold all of them. Therefore, the baker has sold 157 tortes.
Response:  We know that the baker has sold 68 tortes and 92 pastries. So, if he had made more than what he sold, then he must have made at least 143 - (68 + 92) = 143 - 154 = -11 pastries. Therefore, the baker has sold more pastries than he made.
Response:  If the baker sold 44 tarts and he had made 48 at the beginning, then he would have still had 4 (48 - 44 = 4) tarts left to sell.
Response:  If at the beginning he had made 40 tarts and sold 8, then he must have made 32 more tarts (40 - 8 = 32). So, Baker has made 32 additional tarts beyond those sold.
"Response:  If his friend bought 137 tarts from him and he made 169 tarts to start with, then he must have sold some of them before buying more. So let's calculate how many tarts he has left after selling some.

Let X be the number of tarts he had at first (169). Then, if he sold Y tarts, he will have X - Y tarts left. Since he bought Z tarts, he now has X - Y + Z tarts.

We know that Z = 137 because his friend bought that many tarts from him. Therefore, we can write the equation:
X - Y + Z = 169...(1)
Now solve for Y:
Y = X - Z...(2)
Substitute X = 169:
Y = 169 - Z
So, he has sold Y = 102 tarts (since Z = 137). Now he has X - Y = 67 tarts left (since X = 169)."
Response:  The baker has made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones. He sold 86 of them. So he still has 103 - 86 = 17 tarts left.
Response:  The baker has made 99 tarts and sold 89 of them. This means that he still has 10 tarts left (99 - 89 = 10). He then bought 167 new tarts and sold 89 of them again (167 - 89 = 78). So, the number of tarts that the baker bought is equal to the number of tarts he sold (78 - 89 = -11). Therefore, the baker bought -11 tarts.
Response:  The baker has bought 8 new tarts and sold 145 more than he had bought. So, if he had bought x tarts, then he has sold (x + 8) tarts. Therefore, the number of tarts sold is equal to the difference between the number of tarts bought and the number of tarts sold:  Number of tarts sold = x - (x + 8)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of tarts sold = -8  Therefore, the baker has sold -8 tarts more than he had bought.
"Response:  The baker made 62 cakes first and then made another 149 cakes. He sold 144 of them. So, the number of cakes left with the baker is:

62 + 149 - 144 = 7

Therefore, the baker has 7 cakes left."
Response:  The baker has made a total of 81 + 92 = 173 tortes. He sold 46 tortes, so he must have left with 173 - 46 = 127 tortes. Therefore, the baker has made and sold a total of 127 tortes.
Response:  The baker has made 61 pastries and 167 cakes. If he had sold 108 cakes and 44 pastries, then he would have 167 - 108 = 59 cakes left. So, the baker would still have 59 cakes.
Response:  The baker has made 56 pastries and 124 tarts. If he sells 104 tarts and 29 pastries, then he will have 75 remaining pastries ( = 124 - 104). So, the baker will have 75 pastries left ( = 56 + 75).
Response:  The baker has made 52 pastries and 84 tarts. If he sold 102 tarts and 94 pastries, then he must have made more than 102 tarts. In fact, he made 102 + 94 = 196 tarts in total. Therefore, the baker has made 196 tarts more than what he sold.
"Response:  The baker has sold 140 tortes and 92 pastries, so he has made more than that number of pastries. We know that the baker has made 134 pastries, so we can calculate how many extra pastries he has made as follows:

Extra pastries = Sold - Made = 140 - 134 = 6

So, the baker has made 6 additional pastries beyond what he initially made."
Response:  We know that the baker has sold 8 pasticcini and 97 tortes. So, if he had sold only tortes, he would have sold 97 + 8 = 105 tortes. But we also know that he has made 14 tarts. Therefore, the number of tortes he has sold is less than or equal to 105 - 14 = 91 tortes. Thus, the baker has sold at least 91 tortes more than he has made.
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 154 pasticcini and 78 tortes. So, we can write:

Pasticcini sold = 154
Tortes sold = 78

Now, let's see how many pasticcini the baker has made in total:

Total number of pasticcini made = Pasticcini sold + Number of pasticcini not sold (which is equal to the number of tortes made)
= 154 + (Number of tortes made - Tortes sold)
= 154 + (-78)
= 232

So, the baker has made 232 pasticcini in total."
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games for Nintendo and she needs to have 140 games in total, then we need to find out how many more games she must buy.  We can do this by subtracting the number of games she already has from the total number of games needed:

Number of games Kelly needs = Total number of games - Number of games Kelly already has
= 140 - 22
= 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games for Nintendo."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games of Nintendo and gives up 64 parts, then she will have 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games.
Response:  Initially, Kelly had 91 games of Nintendo (given in the question). If she gave away 91 games, then she has none left (since she gave away all her games). So, the number of games Kelly has left is 0.
Response:  Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To have 12 games from Nintendo, Kelly must give away some of her Sony games. So, we need to find out how many Sony games she needs to give away in order to get 12 Nintendo games. We can do this by dividing the number of Sony games she has (70) by the number of Nintendo games she wants (12):  Number of Sony games Kelly needs to give away = 70 / 12 = 5 Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 5 Sony games to get 12 Nintendo games.
"Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To have 31 Sony games left after giving away some of them, we need to subtract the number of Sony games Kelly gave away from the total number of Sony games she had. So, if Kelly gave away x Sony games, then she has 31 - x Sony games left. Since Kelly has 132 Sony games in total, we can set up the equation:

31 = 132 - x

Now, we solve for x by subtracting 132 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100

So, Kelly gave away 100 Sony games."
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and she found other 31 games, then together they have 111 games (80 + 31 = 111). To have 6 parties, Kelly needs to divide 111 games among her friends, which means each friend will get approximately 18.5 games (111 / 6 = 18.5). So, Kelly must give 18-20 games for each of her 6 friends to have 6 parties.
Response:  If Randy has $52$ blocks and he uses them to build a tower, then initially he had $38$ isolated ($38 - 52 = -14$). So, Randy had $14$ isolated at the beginning.
Response:  If Randy has 97 isolated units to build a tower and he uses all of them, then he will have used none for building the tower. So, the number of blocks he used is 97 - 0 = 97.
Response:  We have 79 isolated areas to distribute among the two structures. If we use 14 blocks for each tower, we will need 79/14 = 5.64 towers. Since there are 11 blocks available for building a house, we can build 5.64 / 11 = 0.51 houses. Therefore, there are 79 - 0.51 = 78 isolated areas remaining.
Response:  To build a tower with 58 isolated blocks, we need to use 58 blocks.  For building a house with 53 isolated blocks, we also need to use 53 blocks. So, in total, Randy used 58 + 53 = 111 blocks to construct both the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 37 isolated units to build both the tower and the house. Since he built the tower first, let's assume that he used x blocks of the remaining 33 blocks for the tower and y blocks for the house.  Therefore, we can write the equation: 37 = x + y  Now, we are given that Randy used 33 blocks to build the tower and 13 blocks to build the house. So, substituting these values into our equation, we get: 37 = x + (33 - y)  Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 40  Therefore, Randy used 40 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house.
"Response:  We know that Rand has used 86 blocks to build an islet and 79 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks used for both buildings:

Number of blocks used for building the house - Number of blocks used for building the tower = 86 - 79 = 7
Therefore, Randy used 7 additional blocks to build the house compared to the tower."
Response:  We know that Randy has already used 36 blocks to build a tower. If he wants to use all of his remaining 59 blocks, then he will have to use them all up in building the next layer of the tower. So, after using the last block, he will be left with no blocks at all. Therefore, the number of blocks he has left is zero (0).
Response:  We know that Randy has used 95 blocks to build his house and 50 blocks to build his tower. So, we can say that he has used 45 blocks more for building the tower than for building the house (50 - 95 = 45). Therefore, Randy has used 45 additional blocks to build the tower compared to the number of blocks he used to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 90 isolated to build both the house and the tower. So, we can write down an equation as follows: House = 89 blocks + x Tower = 63 blocks + y Where 'x' is the number of blocks used for building the house and 'y' is the number of blocks used for building the tower. Now, according to the question, the difference between the number of blocks used for building the house and those used for building the tower is equal to 27. Therefore, we can set up another equation as follows: x - y = 27 From these two equations, we can solve for 'x' and 'y'. Solving them simultaneously gives us the values of 'x' = 53 and 'y' = 27. So, Randy used 53 blocks more than he did for building the tower to construct the house.
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have not read 5 of them, that means you have already read 15 books. So, the answer is 15.
"Response:  If there are already 13 books in the series and you still have to read 8 more, then the total number of books in the series is:  13 + 8 = 21. Therefore, there are 21 books in the ""La Scuola Pazzesca e Stupida"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and you have already read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books: 22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, you still need to read 10 books from the series. Similarly, for the movies, we know that there are 10 films in total and you have already seen 56 films. Subtracting the number of films you have already seen from the total number of films gives us: 10 - 56 = -46. Since negative numbers cannot be used as an answer, we will round up to zero (0) to indicate that you have seen all the movies in the series. So, to summarize, you still need to read 10 books and watch none (0) movies from the ""La scuola pazza e stupid"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 films in the series. If we have read 19 books and seen 7 films, then we still need to see 10 more films (17 - 7 = 10). Therefore, we must watch 10 more films from the series.
"Response:  If there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""La scuola pazza e stupid"", then we know that there are at least 20 books and films in total (16 + 14 = 20).  Therefore, if you have read 19 books and seen 13 films, there must be at least 7 more books and 7 more films in the series (19 - 13 = 6 books remaining to read; 13 - 7 = 6 films remaining to see)."
"Response:  If there are eight books and ten films in the series ""La scuola pazza e stupid"", then there must be at least 8 x 10 = 80 films in total.  Since you have seen 61 films, that means there are at most 61 - 80 = 29 more films in the series that you haven't seen yet. Therefore, there are at least 29 more films in the series beyond the ones you have seen."
Response:  If there are 10 books and 11 films in the series, that means we have a total of 10 + 11 = 21 items in the series.  If you have read 13 books and watched 12 films, then you have read 13 - 12 = 1 book more than the number of films you have watched. Therefore, you have read 1 book in addition to the 12 films you have watched.
Response:  If there are 11 books and you have read 7 of them, then there are 4 books left that you haven't read.  Similarly, if there are 17 films and you have watched 21 of them, then there are 6 films left that you haven't watched. So, to find out how many more films you have watched than books you have read, we need to subtract the number of films you haven't watched from the number of books you haven't read:  Number of films watched - Number of books not read = 6 - 4 = 2. Therefore, you have watched 2 more films than books you have read.
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the series that you have already read, and there are 14 different books in the series, then we need to subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books in the series. So, the number of books you still need to read is:  14 - 8 = 6. Therefore, you still need to read 6 more books from the series ""La scuola pazza e stupida""."
Response:  We know that there are 62 films and 19 books in the series. If you have seen 34 films, then you still need to watch 28 more films (62 - 34 = 28). Similarly, if you have read 4 books, then you still need to read 15 more books (19 - 4 = 15). Therefore, you need to read 15 more books.
Response:  We know that there are 8 films in the series and you have watched 4 of them. So, we need to find out how many films you still need to watch. To do this, we can divide the total number of films (8) by the number of films you have already watched (4):  Number of films left to watch = Total number of films - Number of films watched = 8 - 4 = 4 films. Therefore, you still need to watch 4 more films from the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 films and 15 books in the series ""La scuola pazza e stupid"". If you have read 11 books and seen 40 movies, then we can deduce that there are at least 4 books left in the series that you have not yet read or watched. Therefore, there are at least 4 additional books in the series beyond what you have already consumed."
Response:  If there are 17 films and you have seen 63 films from the series, then there must be at least 46 films that you haven't seen yet (63 - 17 = 46).  Therefore, there are at most 46 more films in the series than books you have read (13 + 46 = 59). So, the answer is between 59 and 63 films.
Response:  If there are 10 books and 6 films in the series, that means we have a total of 10 + 6 = 16 items to consider.  We know that you have read 14 films, so we can deduce that you have not watched any of the remaining 2 films (since you mentioned you have seen all 14).  Therefore, the number of books you have read is equal to the number of films you have not watched, which is 2.  So, you have read 2 books in addition to the 14 films you have already seen.
Response:  If there are eight books and five films in the series, that means there are 8 x 5 = 40 items in total.  If you have read 19 of the films and seen 16 of the books, then you have not seen any more than half of the remaining books (since you have only seen 16 out of 40). Therefore, the number of films you have seen beyond what is in the books is at most 13 (since 19 - 16 = 13).
Response:  If Dave had won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 2 tickets for that purpose since he has only 2 left after buying toys. So, Dave used 2 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave had won $10 worth of tickets and used 12 tickets to buy toys, then he has $10 / 12 = 8 tickets left. So, Dave won 8 tickets at the arcade.
Response:  If Dave had won 18 tickets and used 5 to buy toys and other things, that means he has 13 tickets left (18 - 5 = 13). Then, if he used 11 of those remaining tickets to buy clothes, he will have 2 tickets left (13 - 11 = 2). So, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Dave has won 19 tickets and he used 12 tickets to buy toys, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 remaining tickets.  Now, if he uses 7 more tickets to buy clothes, then he will have 0 tickets left. So, the number of tickets Dave used to buy clothes is 7.
Response:  If Dave has won 13 tickets and he used 8 of them to buy toys, then he had 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5).  Then, if he used 18 more tickets to buy clothes, he would have used all his remaining tickets (5), so he has none left (0). Therefore, Dave used 26 tickets in total (8 + 18 = 26) to buy both toys and clothes.
Response:  If Dave had won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, that means he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. He used 10 of them to buy toys, so he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Haley has planted 14 trees in her garden and after the hurricane (tifone) 9 died, we don't know how many trees were left alive. So, let's assume that all the trees planted by Haley are dead. Therefore, the number of dead trees is equal to the total number of trees planted by Haley minus the number of surviving trees. In this case, the answer would be: Number of dead trees = 14 - x Where x is the number of surviving trees. Since we don't have any information about the number of surviving trees, we can't determine the exact number of dead trees. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that at least some of the trees planted by Haley are likely to be dead.
Response:  If Haley had planted 13 trees in her garden before the hurricane hit, and after the hurricane 6 of them died, then we have to find out how many trees are left alive. To do this, we need to subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees that were originally planted. So, if 6 trees died, then the number of living trees is: 13 - 6 = 7 trees. Therefore, 7 trees survived the hurricane.
Response:  If Haley had planted 20 trees in her garden and after the hurricane there were only 4 trees left, then we can conclude that 16 trees died during the hurricane (20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, the answer is 16 trees died during the hurricane.
Response:  If Haley planted 10 trees after the death of Tornado Number 5 and 3 more trees were already there before the tornado, then the total number of trees in her garden is:  10 + 3 = 13 trees. Therefore, Haley has planted 13 trees in her garden.
Response:  Haley had planted 9 trees in her garden before the hurricane (Hurricane 4) killed them all. Then she planted 5 new trees. So, at this point, there are no trees left in Haley's garden that were originally planted by her. However, she has added 5 new ones. Therefore, the total number of trees in Haley's garden now is 5 + 5 = 10 trees.
Response:  At first, Haley planted 12 trees in his courtyard. After the hurricane, two of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in his courtyard.
Response:  At the beginning, Haley had planted 3 trees. After the hurricane, 13 trees in the courtyard died. So, the number of dead trees is equal to the number of surviving trees minus the initial number of plants (3). Therefore, the answer is:  Morto = Sopravvissuto - Iniziale  Morto = 13 - 3 = 10
"Response:  At the beginning of the story, Haley had planted 11 trees in her courtyard. After the hurricane, two of these trees died. So, we have:

Number of surviving trees = 11 - 2 = 9

Therefore, out of the original 11 trees, 9 would have survived the hurricane."
"Response:  If they collect 66 sacchi per day, then we can calculate how many oranges they collect in total per day as follows:

Total number of oranges collected = Number of sacchi x Number of oranges per sacco
= 66 x 28
= 1804 oranges per day
Therefore, they collect 1804 oranges per day."
Response:  If they collect 8 sacchi every day, it means that in one week (7 days) they will have collected 8 x 7 = 56 sacchi. To collect 24 sacchi, therefore, it will take them approximately 24 / 56 = 45 days.
"Response:  If the orange harvest lasts for 4 days, then each day they will collect x number of bags. Since they have collected a total of 56 bags, we can write an equation as follows:
x + x + x + x = 56
Solving for x, we get:
x = 14
So, they collect 14 bags of oranges per day."
Response:  After 49 days of collection, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1752 sacchi of oranges.
Response:  After 87 days of collection, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5904 aranges.
Response:  We know that the oranges are collected in 8 bags per day, and each bag contains 35 oranges. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of oranges = 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day. Therefore, the correct answer is 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they collect 16 sacchi every day, it means that in one week (7 days) they will collect 112 sacchi (16 x 7). To reach 80 sacchi, it would take them approximately 3 weeks (80 / 112 = 2.66 weeks). Therefore, it would take them approximately 2 weeks and 3 days to gather 80 sacchi of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 67 bags per day and each bag contains 12 oranges, then in one day they will collect 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. So if they collect 35 bags of oranges in total, that means they collected 35 x 12 = 420 oranges in total.
Response:  After 51 days of collection, they will have collected 51 x 74 = 3690 sacchi of oranges. However, they throw away 71 sacchi per day, so after 51 days they will have thrown away 71 x 51 = 3621 sacchi of oranges. Therefore, at the end of 51 days, they will have 3690 - 3621 = 169 sacchi of oranges left.
"Response:  If they collect 76 bags per day and discard 64, that means they collect 12 more bags than they discard. So, if each bag contains 50 oranges, then the total number of oranges collected per day is:

$$ = \frac{12}{3} \times 50 = 200 $$

Therefore, they collect $200$ oranges per day."
Response:  After 26 days of collection, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 704 bags of ripe oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 bags of unripe oranges. Therefore, after 26 days of collection, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of collection, if they collect 82 bags of ripe oranges per day, in total they will have collected 2050 bags (82 x 25 = 2050). If they also collect 61 bags of unripe oranges per day, after 25 days they will have collected an additional 1530 bags (61 x 25 = 1530), for a total of 3580 bags (2050 + 1530) of oranges collected over 25 days. So, after 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 3580 bags of mature oranges.
"Response:  After 45 days of collection, the total number of bags collected will be equal to the total number of bags collected per day multiplied by 45.  Therefore, the number of unripe oranges left after 45 days of collection is:  
$$ \text {Number of unripe oranges} = \text{Total number of bags collected} \times \frac{\text{Days of collection}}{ \text{Days until ripe}} $$  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  
$$ \text {Number of unripe oranges} = 31 \times \frac{45}{7} = 695 $$  So, after 45 days of collection, there will be $ 695$ unripe oranges left."
"Response:  We know that 44 sacchi di arance mature + 25 sacchi di arance non mature = 69 sacchi di arance al giorno (since we subtracted the number of immature oranges from the total). So, to find out how many more mature oranges are collected than immature ones, we need to subtract the number of immature oranges from the total number of oranges collected:  
$$ \therefore 69 - 25 = 44 $$  Therefore, $44$ more mature oranges are collected than immature ones per day."
Response:  We know that in total, 129 sacchi of oranges are collected per day (5 mature + 74 immature). Since we have been told that 74 sacchi of immature oranges are collected per day, this means that there are 55 sacchi of immature oranges that are not collected per day ($129 - $74 = $55$). Therefore, the number of sacchi of immature oranges collected per day is $55$.
"Response:  If they collected 54 bags of oranges in total, and they collected 18 bags per day, then we can calculate how many days it took them to collect all those oranges as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of bags / Number of bags collected per day
= 54 / 18
= 3 days

Therefore, it took them 3 days to collect all 54 bags of oranges."
Response:  If they collected 56 bags of oranges in one day, then they collected 56 x 14 = 780 bags of oranges in total over 14 days. Therefore, they were collecting 780 / 14 = 55 bags of oranges per day.
Response:  After 73 days of collection, if they collect 5 bags of ripe oranges per day, then in total they will have collected 5 x 73 = 365 bags of ripe oranges.  Since they also collect 25 bags of unripe oranges per day, after 73 days they will have collected 25 x 73 = 1825 bags of unripe oranges.  Therefore, after 73 days of collection, they will have a total of 365 + 1825 = 2190 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 6 days of collection, if they collect 65 unripe oranges per day, then in total they will have collected 65 x 6 = 390 unripe oranges. Similarly, if they collect 46 ripe oranges per day, then in total they will have collected 46 x 6 = 276 ripe oranges. Therefore, after 6 days of collection, they will have a total of 390 + 276 = 666 oranges that are not yet ripe.
Response:  We know that 86 sacchi di arance mature vengono raccolti al giorno.  Now we need to find out how many more sacchi of mature oranges are collected than immature ones. So, we subtract the number of immature oranges from the total number of oranges collected:  86 - 41 = 45  Therefore, 45 additional sacchi of mature oranges are collected each day compared to immature ones.
Response:  We know that in total, 71 sacchi of immature oranges are collected per day. Of these, 60 are mature oranges. So, the number of unripe oranges collected is 71 - 60 = 11. Therefore, 11 sacchi of unripe oranges are collected per day.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 4 meters and its width as 3 meters. To find out how much longer Jesse's room is than his stanza, we need to subtract the width of his stanza from its length. So, we have: Length of Jesse's room - Width of Jesse's stanza = 4 m - 3 m = 1 meter Therefore, Jesse's stanza is 1 meter longer than his room.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 2 meters. If it serves a carpet with an area of 4 square meters, then we need to find out how long the carpet is in relation to the length of the room. So, if the width of the carpet is x meters, then the length of the carpet is equal to 4 meters divided by x meters. Solving for x, we get x = 1 meter. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 meters.
Response:  The room is 2 meters wide, so it's length is equal to its width divided by 2 = 1 meter. Now we have a rectangle with dimensions of 1 meter x 4 meters = 4 square meters. Therefore, the length of the room is 4 meters.
Response:  The room is 3 meters long and 4 meters wide, so its area is: Area = length x width = 3 x 4 = 12 square meters. Since there are already 4 square meters of carpet covering the floor, we need to cover an additional 8 square meters (12 - 4 = 8) to completely cover the floor. Therefore, Jessie needs 8 more square meters of carpet.
Response:  The room is 12 feet wide and 24 feet long, so its area is: Area = Length x Width = 12 x 24 = 288 square feet. Since each tile has an area of 1 square meter, we need to divide the total area of the room by the area of one tile to find out how many tiles we need: Number of tiles = Total area / Area of one tile = 288 / 10 = 28 tiles. Therefore, we need 28 tiles to cover the entire floor.
Response:  Since each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, we can calculate the area of one room as follows: Area = Length x Width = 19 ft x 18 ft = 347 sq ft.  Now, there are 20 rooms in total, so to cover the entire floor with carpeting, we need to multiply the area of one room by the number of rooms: Total area needed for all rooms = Number of rooms x Room area = 20 x 347 = 6,940 sq ft.
"Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 19 feet and its width as 20 feet. To find out how much longer Jesse's room is than its width, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, the length of Jesse's room minus its width is:  
Length = 19 - 20 = -1 feet  
Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot shorter than its width."
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of 3 square meters to cover his room. Since he wants to use it to cover the entire room, we can assume that the length and width of the room are equal. So, if the room is long 1 meter and half, then its width must be also 1 meter and half. Therefore, the width of the room is 1.5 meters.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of 3 square meters to cover his room. Since he is measuring in feet and inches, we can convert this value to feet. One meter is equal to 39.4 inches, so one square meter is equal to 39.4 x 39.4 = 1576.8 square feet. Therefore, Jesse needs a rug of 3 square meters, which is equivalent to 3 x 1576.8 = 4700.4 square feet. Now, since Jesse's room is wide 2 feet, we can find its length by dividing the area of the rug by the width of the room. So, the length of Jesse's room is 4700.4 / 2 = 2350.2 feet.
Response:  The room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so it has an area of 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jesse has a rug that covers 5 meters squared, we need to convert this measurement from meters to feet. There are 1 meter in 3.2808 feet, so 5 meters squared is equal to 5 x 3.2808 = 16.4444 square feet. Therefore, Jesse needs 80 - 16.4444 = 63.5556 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that the shop makes $23 profit per t-shirt sold. So if they sell x t-shirts, their total revenue will be $23x. Since they made $230 during the game, their total sales must have been $230 / $23 = 9 t-shirts. Therefore, they sold 9 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  If the store sold $51 worth of shirts during the game and they sold 3 shirts, then we can calculate the cost per shirt as follows: Cost per shirt = Total revenue / Number of shirts sold = $51 / 3 = $17 per shirt
"Response:  We know that the Razorback store made $87 per each shirt sold. So if they sold x shirts during the Arkansas game and y shirts during the Texas Tech game, their total revenue is:

Arkansas game: x \* $87 = 87x
Texas Tech game: y \* $87 = 87y
Total revenue: 87x + 87y
We are also given that the total number of shirts sold during both games is 95. So we can set up the equation:

87x + 87y = 95
Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 47 (since 47 is the number of shirts sold during the Arkansas game)
y = 48 (since 48 is the number of shirts sold during the Texas Tech game)
Therefore, the Razorback store made $87 per each shirt sold during the Arkansas game and $87 per each shirt sold during the Texas Tech game, so their total revenue was $87(47) + $87(48) = $361."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback store made $106 in profit for each shirt sold during both games combined. So if they sold x shirts during the Arkansas game and y shirts during the Texas Tech game, their total profit would be:

Profit = (x x $106) + (y x $106)

We also know that the total number of shirts sold during both games was 242. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 242

Now we have two equations and two variables. Solving them simultaneously, we get:

x = 115 (from the first equation)
y = 127 (from the second equation)

So the Razorback store sold 115 shirts during the Arkansas game and 127 shirts during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  We know that the Razorback store made $98 per each shirt sold during the game. So if they sold x shirts during the Arkansas game, they made $98x dollars in total. However, we are also told that they sold a total of 163 shirts during both games combined. Therefore, the amount of money they made from selling shirts during the Arkansas game is equal to $98x / 2 = $49 per shirt.
Response:  During the game of Arkansas, they sold $172$ magliettes and earned $78$$ per each magliette, so they earned a total of $13400$.  Now, during the game of Texas Tech, they sold $186$ magliettes, which means they earned $78$$ per each magliette again, resulting in an additional amount of $15360$. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling t-shirts during both games is $168960$.
Response:  The shop makes $62 per t-shirt and $99 per jersey. If they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, their total revenue would be:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price per jersey  Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99  Revenue = $11,543 + $2,799  Revenue = $14,342 So, the shop made $14,342 in revenue from selling t-shirts and jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  The shop makes $67 per t-shirt and $165 per jacket. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 jackets. So, their total revenue from selling these items is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of jackets x Price per jacket  Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165  Revenue = $4932 + $2590  Revenue = $7522 In conclusion, the shop made $7522 in revenue from selling t-shirts and jackets during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the store makes $192 per each t-shirt and $34 per each tank top. Then, we are told that they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 tank tops during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, the total revenue from these sales is:

T-shirt sales = 157 x $192 = $28,640
Tank top sales = 19 x $34 = $656
Total revenue = $28,640 + $656 = $30,396
Now, let's find out how much more a premium t-shirt costs than a regular one. We can do this by subtracting the price of a regular t-shirt (which is $34) from the price of a premium t-shirt (which is unknown). So, the cost of a premium t-shirt minus a regular t-shirt is:

Premium t-shirt cost - Regular t-shirt cost =?
We are given that the store made $192 per each t-shirt, so the cost of a premium t-shirt must be greater than $192. In fact, since the store made more money from selling premium t-shirts than regular ones, we can assume that the premium t-shirt cost is at least $192 plus some additional amount for extra features or quality.
Therefore, the cost of a premium t-shirt is at least:

Premium t-shirt cost ≥ $192 + x
where x represents the additional amount over and above $192. Since we don't know exactly how much more the premium t-shirt costs, we will round up the answer to the nearest whole number.
So, the cost of a premium t-shirt is at least $192 plus an additional $20, which gives us a minimum cost of $212 for a premium t-shirt."
Response:  The cost of one T-shirt is $232 and the cost of one jersey is $10 more than that (since it costs $10 more to make a jersey than a T-shirt). So, if we call the cost of a T-shirt x, then the cost of a jersey would be x + 10 = 242. Now, let's find out how much more expensive a jersey is compared to a T-shirt: Jerseys are $242 - $232 = $10 more expensive per item. Therefore, a jersey costs $10 more than a T-shirt.
Response:  The shop sells every t-shirt for $51 dollars. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they offered an discount of $8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. So, total revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold x Price of each t-shirt - Discount given per t-shirt Total revenue from t-shirts = 130 x $51 - $8 Total revenue from t-shirts = $6420 $6420 is the amount that the shop has gained from selling t-shirts during the game.
Response:  The shop sells every shirt for $201 dollars. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they increased the price of each shirt to $217 dollars. They sold 14 shirts. So, we need to find out how much money did they make from selling those shirts. To do this, we can multiply the number of shirts sold by the price at which they were originally sold: Number of shirts sold = 14 Shirts originally sold for $201 dollars x Price increase = $217 dollars Total amount earned = Number of shirts sold x Price increase = $201 dollars x $217 dollars = $43,570 dollars Therefore, the shop made $43,570 dollars from selling those 14 shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the Razorback Store made $60 selling t-shirts. If they make $10 for every t-shirt sold, then we can find out how many t-shirts they sold by dividing the total amount of money earned by the profit per t-shirt. So, let's do that: $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts sold. Therefore, the Razorback Store sold 6 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the Razorback store sold $215 worth of shirts. If they sold 5 shirts, then we can calculate the cost per shirt as follows: Cost per shirt = Total revenue / Number of shirts sold = $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt. Therefore, each shirt costs $43.
Response:  The store makes $5 per each shirt and $215 for each T-shirt. So if they sold 20 tank tops and 64 T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, how much money did they make in total?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of items sold by their respective prices:  For the tank tops, the store made $5 x 20 = $100.  For the T-shirts, the store made $215 x 64 = $13,700.  Therefore, the total amount of money the store made during the game is $100 + $13,700 = $13,800.
Response:  The store makes $76 per each shirt and $204 for each jacket. So if they sold x shirts, they made $x \times 76 = 76x dollars in total. If they sold y jackets, they made $y \times 204 = 204y dollars in total. Since we know that the total amount of money earned is equal to both amounts added together, we can set up the equation: 76x + 204y = 158(shirts) + 2(jackets). Solving for x and y gives us: x = 39 and y = 12. Therefore, the store made $76x = 76(39) = 2874 dollars from selling shirts and $204y = 204(12) = 2448 dollars from selling jackets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the store makes $210 per each shirt and $240 for each jacket. So, if they sold x shirts, they made $210x dollars in revenue. Similarly, if they sold y jackets, they made $240y dollars in revenue.  Now, let's find out how much it costs more than a T-shirt to buy a hoodie. We are given that the store sold 177 T-shirts and 23 hoodies. So, the total revenue from selling these items is:  Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price of hoodie  Revenue = 177 x $21 + 23 x $240  Revenue = $5,693  Therefore, the cost of one hoodie is more than one T-shirt by: Cost difference = Revenue - (Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt) Cost difference = $5,693 - ($177 x $21) Cost difference = $5,693 - $3,883 Cost difference = $1,810  So, the cost of one hoodie is more than one T-shirt by $1,810.
Response:  The total revenue from selling shirts is $25 x 78 = $1900 and the total revenue from selling hats is $115 x 113 = $1305. So, the difference between the cost of one hat and one shirt is: $1305 - $1900 =-$605. Therefore, it costs more than $605 to buy one hat than one shirt.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. So, there are 50 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If there are 12 chairs in the courtyard and they have two series of tables with the same number of seats, then each table must have 6 chairs (since 12 / 2 = 6). So, there are 6 chairs at each table.
Response:  If there are 9 seats in the courtyard and each table has 3 chairs, then we can deduce that there are 9 / 3 = 3 tables with 3 chairs each. Therefore, there are 3 tables in total.
"Response:  If they have 11 tables and 13 chairs each, then they have in total:

11 x 11 = 121 tables
13 x 13 = 169 chairs

So, there are 169 chairs in the courtyard."
Response:  If there are 10 tables and 6 chairs, that means there are 60 seats in total (10 x 6 = 60).  If there are 11 people sitting on a chair, that means 59 people are left without a seat (60 - 11 = 59). So, there are 59 empty seats.
Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and 14 chairs in total. This means that each table has 1 chair (since there are 12 tables x 1 chair/table = 12 chairs). Therefore, we have 12 chairs for every 3 tables ( since there are 12 tables / 3 tables/chair = 12 chairs/3 tables). So, if they decide to invite guests, they will need additional chairs for them. Based on this information, we can conclude that they will need 6 more chairs ( since there are already 12 chairs/3 tables x 2 (for the hosts) = 6 extra chairs needed). Thus, the number of chairs available for the guests is 6 + 12 = 18 chairs.
"Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and they have already set up 4 series of tables with 3 chairs each, then we need to find out how many additional chairs are needed. To do this, we can use multiplication. We know that each series has 3 chairs, so if we add 14 people to the equation, we get:

4 series x 3 chairs per series = 12 chairs (already provided) + 14 people = 26 chairs needed.
Therefore, the answer is 26 chairs."
Response:  If they have 9 tables and each table has 14 chairs, then we can calculate how many more chairs they have as follows: Number of chairs = Total number of tables x Number of chairs per table - Total number of tables So, if they have 9 tables, then the total number of tables is 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. Since they have 9 tables, they have 126 - 9 = 117 chairs in addition to the ones already at their tables. Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Se Lewis collects $460 in 5 weeks, that means he collected $92 per week ($460 / 5). Therefore, Se Lewis earns $92 every week during his collection period.
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks the harvest lasted as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 76 weeks

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 76 weeks."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, he will have earned a total of:

$21 x 216 = $4,596

If he has to pay $702 in taxes, his net income at the end of the season will be:

$4,596 - $702 = $3,894

Therefore, Lewis will have $3,894 at the end of the season."
"Response:  If Se Lewis earns $1357 every week during 223 weeks of harvest season, then he earns:
$$ \text {Total income} = \text {Weekly income} \times \text {Number of weeks} $$
$$ \text {Total income} = $1357 \times 223 = $296,810 $$
If Se Lewis works for 73 seasons of harvest, his total income would be:
$$ \text {Total income} = \text {Weekly income} \times \text {Number of seasons} $$
$$ \text {Total income} = $296,810 \times 73 = $20,463,330 $$"
"Response:  During the harvest season, Lewis works for 109 weeks. Since he earns $28/week during regular hours and $939/week for overtime, his total weekly income during the harvest season is:
$28 x 109 = $3,062
So, during the harvest season, Lewis earns $3,062/week."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week for 23 weeks of harvesting and pays $49 in rent every week, then his total income during the harvest season is:

Total income = Number of weeks x Weekly income
= 23 x $403
= $8,790

So, during the harvest season, Lewis earns $8,790."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks of harvesting. If he pays $388 in rent every week, how much does he pay as rent during the harvest season?  To find out, we need to calculate the number of weeks in the harvest season and multiply it by the amount of rent he pays per week.  So, if we assume that the harvest season lasts for 20 weeks, then Lewis pays $760 ($388 x 20) in rent during the harvest season.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis has collected during the season of harvest. According to the question, he earned $491 per week for 1181 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings are: $$ = \text {491} \times \text{1181} = 573,091 dollars$$ Now, we need to subtract the amount that Lewis pays in rent each week. According to the question, he pays $216 per week in rent. So, we can deduct this amount from his total earnings to find out how much he will have at the end of the season: $$ = \text {573,091 - 216} = 541,995 dollars$$ Therefore, Lewis will have $541,995 at the end of the season.
Response:  If Lewis collects for 19 weeks and earns $133 in total, then he must have earned an average of $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week during the harvest and he earned a total of $178, then we can write an equation as follows:

$2 x number of weeks = $178

Now, to find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we need to divide both sides of the equation by $2:

number of weeks = $178 / $2

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 89 weeks (or approximately 4 months)."
Response:  If Dean is 9 feet tall and he takes a bath in water that is 10 times deeper than him (so 90 feet deep), then we can calculate the depth of the water relative to Dean as follows:  Depth of water = 90 feet - 9 feet = 81 feet. So, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean.
Response:  We know that Dean is lower than Ron by two and a half meters (2.5 m). So if Ron is at a height of 4 m, then Dean must be at least 6.5 m below him (4 - 2.5 = 6.5). Now we need to find out how deep the water is. The depth of the water is twice the height of Dean above it. Therefore, the depth of the water is twice 6.5 = 13 m.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to take a bath. The depth of the water is 5 times the height of Ron. Since Dean is lower than Ron, we can say that Dean is at least as high as the water level. So, if Ron is 12 feet tall, then the water must be at least 60 feet deep (5 x 12 = 60).
Response:  We know that Dean is taller than Ron by 1.5 meters (or 5 feet). So, if Ron is at a depth of 4 meters, then Dean must be at least 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 meters above the water level. Now we can use the given information about the depth of the water to find out how deep it was: The water was 15 times deeper than Dean's height, which means it was 15 x 5.5 = 82.5 meters deep!
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to take a bath. The depth of the water is 16 times the height of Ron. Since Dean is higher than Ron by 3 meters, we can say that the height of Ron is x meters. Therefore, the depth of the water is 16x meters. If Ron is at a height of 4 meters, then the depth of the water would be 16(4) = 64 meters.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to take a bath. The depth of the water is 9 times the height of Dean. So if Dean is 5 meters tall, then the depth of the water must be 45 meters (9 x 5).
Response:  If there are 34 books distributed equally among 2 libraries, then each library has $\frac{34}{2} = 17$ books.
Response:  If Brian has looked at his accounts and found that he has a total of 42 books, then each book represents 1/42 of all the books he owns. Since every library contains 2 books, we can say that there are 2 x 42 = 84 libraries in total. Therefore, Brian has 84 libraries.
Response:  We know that Brian has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 libraries. Therefore, he has a total number of books equal to $27 \times 23 = 611$ books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines equal to $80 \times 23 = 1920$ magazines. So, in total, Brian has $\boxed{611 + 1920 = 2531}$ items in all his libraries combined.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and 46 magazines in each of his 10 libraries, then he has a total of: Books: 9 x 10 = 90 Magazines: 46 x 10 = 460 So, Brian has a total of 90 + 460 = 550 publications.
Response:  We know that Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 magazine racks. Therefore, he has a total number of books equal to $23 \times 29 = 745$ books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines equal to $61 \times 29 = 1829$ magazines. So, in total, Brian has $745 + 1829 = 2574$ books and magazines.
Response:  We know that Brian has 7 libraries with the same number of books. So, if he has x books in total, then he must have 7x books in his libraries. Since there are 28 books in total, we can set up the equation: 7x = 28. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. Therefore, there are 4 books in each library.
Response:  We know that Brian has looked at his accounts and found out that he has 38 books in total. Since each library contains 2 books, we can deduce that Brian has __________ libraries. Therefore, the answer is 38 / 2 = 19 libraries.
"Response:  If Carol wants to send birthday invitations to 10 friends and each pack of invites contains 2 invitations, she will need:

$ Number of friends = 10 $
$ Number of invitations per pack = 2 $

To find out how many packs she needs, we can divide the number of friends by the number of invitations per pack:

$ Number of packs = $\frac{Number of friends}{Number of invitations per pack}$
= $\frac{10}{2}$
= 5 packs

Therefore, Carol needs 5 packs of invitations to send birthday invitations to all her 10 friends."
Response:  If Carol has bought three packages of invitations and each package contains the same number of invites, then we can say that the total number of invitations she has purchased is equal to the number of packages multiplied by the number of invitations in each package. So, if we know how many invitations are in each package, we can easily find out how many invitations Carol has purchased altogether. According to the question, each package contains 4 invitations, so the total number of invitations Carol has purchased is: 3 packages x 4 invitations/package = 12 invitations. Therefore, there are 12 invitations in each package.
Response:  If Carol has bought 7 packs of invitations and each pack contains 10 invitations, then she has a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations.  If she sends only two invitations to her friends, then the number of remaining invitations is 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  At first, Carol bought 6 packs of invitations, each containing 14 invites, so she invited 84 friends (6 x 14 = 84). Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number to 95 (84 + 11 = 95). Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends to her birthday party.
Response:  If Carol has bought 2 packages of invitations each containing 3 invites, then she has a total of 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional invitations equal to the number of friends she wants to invite minus the number of invitations she already has. In this case, she needs to buy 9 - 6 = 3 more invitations. Therefore, Carol needs to buy 3 extra invitations.
Response:  If Melissa has scored 12 points in each game and she has played x games, then her total score is 12x. Since she has scored 36 points in total, we can set up the equation: 12x = 36. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, Melissa has played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa has played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27). So, in each game, Melissa scored 27 points.
Response:  If Melissa has scored 109 points in every game and obtained 82 points as bonus, then her total score for each game is: Total score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Since there were 79 games played, Melissa has scored a total of: Total score = 191 x 79 = 14,539 points. Therefore, Melissa has scored 14,539 points in 79 games.
Response:  If Melissa has scored a total of 21 points and she scored 7 points in each game, then we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 21 = (Number of games) x 7 Therefore, to find out how many games Melissa played, we need to divide the total score by the score per game: Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 So, Melissa played 3 games.
"Response:  If Melissa has scored 91 points in 13 games and she always scores the same thing, then we can assume that her score is constant throughout all the games. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this assumption:

Melissa's score = Constant value

Now, let's analyze each game separately:

Game 1: Melissa scored x points
Game 2: Melissa scored x points
...
Game 13: Melissa scored x points

Since Melissa always scores the same thing, we can conclude that her score in each game is equal to the constant value we previously defined. Therefore, we can substitute the values of x from each game into the equation:

x + 91 = Constant value

Solving for x, we get:

x = 70

So, Melissa scored 70 points in every game."
Response:  If there are 4 seats in total and 20 people can drive at the same time, then each seat will be occupied by one person. So, the number of people who can sit on each seat is 20/4 = 5. Therefore, 5 people can sit on each seat or 5 x 4 = 20 people in total can ride the Ferris wheel at once.
Response:  If there are 18 people who can drive the Ferris wheel at the same time and each seat can hold 9 people, then we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats the Ferris wheel has. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that each panoramic wheel at Paradise Park has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. To find out how many people can drive 20 panoramic wheels simultaneously, we need to divide the number of seats in one wheel by the number of people it can accommodate per seat. So, if we have 20 panoramic wheels, we can accommodate 20 x 15 = 300 people. Therefore, the answer is 300.
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in total on the Panorama Wheel at Paradise Park and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, if 10 seats are broken or unavailable, we have 18 - 10 = 8 available seats left for passengers to ride the wheel simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that the Panorama Wheel at Paradise Park has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. So, if there are currently 16 people on the wheel, we need to find out how many additional people can join them. To do this, we divide 16 by 14, which gives us 108/14 = 7.5. Therefore, 7 more people can join the wheel.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can sit on the small seats. Now, let's count how many people can sit on the large seats. There are 23 large seats, and each of them can accommodate 54 people, so we have 23 x 54 = 1208 people who can sit on the large seats. Therefore, the total number of people who can go on the Ferris wheel is 28 + 1208 = 1236 people.
Response:  We know that there are 7 large seats on the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park. Each of these seats can accommodate 12 people, so the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel in large seats is:  7 x 12 = 84 people.
Response:  If 16 people can go to the same time on the Ferris wheel in the Paradise Park, then each seat on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 16/4 = 4 people. Therefore, each seat on the Ferris wheel can contain 4 people.
Response:  If 4 people can go to the panoramic wheel in the Paradise Park at the same time, then we know that each place on the wheel can hold 2 people. So, how many places are there on the wheel? We don't have any information about the size or shape of the wheel, but let's assume it is circular with equal distance between each place. Therefore, if the wheel has $n$ places, each place will be $\frac{360}{n}$ degrees apart from its neighboring place. Since each person takes up $\frac{180}{2}$ degrees of space (since they are facing opposite directions), the total angle subtended by each place on the wheel is $\frac{180}{2} \times \frac{360}{n}$. This means that the circumference of the circle inscribed within the wheel is $\frac{360}{n} \times \frac{180}{2} = 720 \times \frac{n}{2}$. Now, since each place on the wheel can hold 2 people, the total number of people who can fit on the wheel is $\frac{720 \times n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of places on the wheel.
Response:  If we have ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then there are 7 x Number of slices per pizza = Total number of slices. Since there are 14 slices total, we can set up the equation: 7x = 14. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. So, there are 2 slices in every pizza.
Response:  If we have ordered n pizzas and each pizza has two slices, then the total number of slices is 2n. Since there are 28 slices in total, we can set up the equation 2n = 28. Solving for n, we get n = 14. Therefore, we have ordered 14 pizzas.
Response:  We have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. Therefore, we will have 17 x 4 = 68 pieces of pizza in total. So there are 25 - 68 = -43 pieces of pizza left over.
Response:  If we have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are two of us, if we divide the total number of slices equally between us, we will get 90/2 = 45 slices per person.
Response:  If Paige and her mother have planted 10 seeds in each of the 45 aisles, then they have planted a total of 10 x 45 = 450 seeds. Therefore, the answer is 450.
Response:  If Paige and her mother have planted 45 seeds in 9 aisles, then they must have divided that number of seeds equally among the 9 aisles. Therefore, each aisuole contains an equal number of seeds, which is 5 seeds per aisuole. So, they have planted 5 seeds in each of the 9 aisoles.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total. Since only 58 flowers grew in each of the 12 aisles, we can deduce that there were 58 / 12 = 4.75 flowers per aisle. Therefore, the number of flower beds is 4.75.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother have planted 55 seeds in total. Since they put 15 seeds in each hole, we can calculate the number of holes as follows:  Number of holes = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per hole = 55 / 15 = 3.75 holes.  Now, let's assume that only 60% of the seeds germinated (this is just an assumption, since we don't have any information about the seed germination rate). So, the actual number of flowers produced would be: Number of flowers = Number of seeds that germinated x 100 / Total number of seeds = 60% x 3.75 = 2.48 flowers. Therefore, Paige and her mother have helped to grow approximately 2.48 flowers.
Response:  If they planted 10 seeds per each of the 5 aisles, then they have planted a total of 50 seeds (10 x 5 = 50). So if they now plant 60 more seeds, they will have a total of 110 seeds (60 + 50 = 110). Therefore, after planting all 60 seeds, they will have 110 lettas of flowers (110 - 50 = 60).
Response:  If they planted 32 seeds in total and Paige is helping her mother plant them in eight aisles, then they must have divided the number of seeds equally among the eight aisles. So, if they divide 32 by 8, we get 4 seeds per aisle. Therefore, each aisle has 4 seeds.
Response:  If Matthew has taken some crackers and given them to his friends, then he must have had some crackers left over after giving them away. So, let's say that Matthew initially had x crackers. Since he gave 2 crackers to each of his 11 friends, he gave a total of 2x crackers away. Therefore, the number of crackers Matthew had left is x - 2x = -0.9 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 crackers to give away and he gave 2 crackers to each of his friends, then he has given a total of 8 / 2 = 4 friends crackers. Therefore, Matthew has given crackers to 4 friends.
Response:  If Matthew has given the same number of crackers to his 5 friends and they have still got 10 crackers left, then each friend must have received 2 crackers (since there are 5 friends). So, Matthew must have eaten 5 x 2 = 10 crackers himself. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Matthew has given 24 crackers to his friends and he is left with 17 crackers, then he must have given each of his three friends an equal number of crackers. So, if Matthew gave 24 crackers to his friends, then he gave 8 crackers to each friend (since 24 / 3 = 8). Therefore, Matthew gave 8 crackers to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew has given the same number of crackers and tarts to his 11 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of both crackers and tarts. So if he gave 22 crackers in total, he must have given 22/11 = 2 crackers to each of his friends. Similarly, if he gave 34 tarts in total, he must have given 34/11 = 3 tarts to each of his friends. Therefore, each of Matthew's friends ate 2 crackers and 3 tarts.
"Response:  If Matthew had given the same number of crackers and tarts to his two friends, then the total number of crackers he gave is equal to the total number of tarts he gave. Therefore, if he gave x crackers, he also gave x tarts. Since there are 30 tarts in total, we can write the equation:
x = 30
Now, we know that Matthew gave 29 crackers, so the value of x is 29. Therefore, each friend got 29 tarts."
Response:  If Matthew has given the same number of crackers and tarts to his 7 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of both crackers and tarts. So if Matthew has eaten 14 crackers and 21 tarts, then each of his friends must have eaten 14/7 = 2 cracker and 21/7 = 3 tarts. Therefore, each of Matthew's friends has eaten 2 crackers and 3 tarts in total.
Response:  If Matthew has given the same number of crackers to his 18 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of crackers. So, if Matthew gave x crackers to each of his 18 friends, then the total number of crackers he gave away is 18x.  Since there are 36 crackers in total, and Matthew gave away 18x crackers, we can set up the equation: 36 = 18x.  Solving for x, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his 18 friends 2 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew gave 6 crackers to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 6 x 5 = 30 crackers. So, Matthew has 30 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 crackers and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 23/2 = 11 crackers to each friend. So, each friend ate 11 crackers.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 crackers and he gave some to his friends. So, after giving them away, he had 23 crackers left. To find out how many crackers he gave to his friends, we can divide the number of crackers he had left (23) by the number of friends he had (5):  Number of crackers given to friends = Total number of crackers left / Number of friends  Number of crackers given to friends = 23 / 5  Number of crackers given to friends = 4.6  Therefore, Matthew gave 4 or 5 crackers to each of his 5 friends.
"Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and tarts to his four friends, then he must have given 8 (equal to half of 16) crackers to each friend. Therefore, the total number of crackers that Matthew gave away is:

$$ = \text {Number of crackers} \times \text{ Number of friends} $$
= $ $\text{32}$ $\times$ $\text{4}$ $\times$ $\frac{\text{half}}{2}$ $=$ $\boxed{16}$
So, Matthew gave away 16 crackers to each of his four friends."
Response:  If Matthew had initially 10 crackers and 8 tarts, that means he has a total of 18 snacks (10 + 8).  Since he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his four friends, the number of crackers each friend received is half of the initial amount of crackers, which is 5 crackers per person (since there are 4 friends). Therefore, the number of cakes each friend received is also half of the initial amount of cakes, which is 4 cakes per person ( since there are 4 friends). So, if each friend got 5 crackers and 4 cakes, then together they ate 20 snacks (5 x 4 = 20).  Thus, each friend ate 5 snacks in total (5 crackers + 4 cakes).
"Response:  If Matthew had given the same number of crackers and tarts to his 28 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of both crackers and tarts. So, if x is the number of crackers that Matthew gave to each of his friends, then the number of tarts that he gave to each friend is also x. Since there are 13 crackers and 15 tarts initially, we can write the equation:
x + x = 13 (crackers) + 15 (tarts)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 28
Solving for x, we find that Matthew gave each friend 14 crackers and 14 tarts. Therefore, the total number of crackers that Matthew gave away is 14 x 28 = 368, and the total number of tarts that he gave away is 14 x 28 = 368."
Response:  If Debbie bought x bottles of water and was drinking 109 bottles per day, then after 74 days she would have drunk (109 x 74) = 8260 bottles. So, Debbie must have bought x - 8260 = 3540 bottles initially.
Response:  If Debbie bought 153 bottles of water and they lasted for 17 days, then she must have drunk an equal number of bottles every day. So, if she drank x bottles per day, then after 17 days, she would have drunk 153x bottles altogether. Therefore, the answer is 153x.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 264 bottles of water and she drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows:

Days = 11
Bottles drunk/day = 15
Total bottles drunk = Days x Bottles drunk/day = 11 x 15 = 165

So, Debbie has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles of water remaining."
Response:  If Debbie bought 301 bottles of water and drank 144 bottles per day for some days, then she must have drunk for x number of days. We know that after drinking for x days, she had 157 bottles left, so we can write an equation as follows:  Number of bottles drunk = Total number of bottles - Remaining bottles  In this case, the total number of bottles is 301 (Debbie bought), and the remaining bottles are 157 (which were left). So, we can substitute these values into the equation above to get:  Number of bottles drunk = 301 - 157  = 144  Therefore, Debbie drank water for 144 days.
Response:  If Debbie drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda every day, she will consume 4 + 87 = 91 bottles of liquid per day. Since she has bought 88 bottles of water, this amount will last her for 91 / 88 = 10 days. Therefore, the number of days that Debbie's supply of water would last is 10 days.
Response:  If Debbie drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day, then she will consume 312 + 4 = 316 bottles of liquid per day. Since she has already consumed 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda, there are 316 - (200 + 256) = 70 bottles of soda left. Therefore, the number of days that the remaining bottles of soda will last is 70 / 4 = 17.5 days. So, the answer is 17 days.
"Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and buys a total of 12 bottles of water, then she will have enough water for:

Days = Total bottles / Number of bottles per day
= 12 / 6
= 2 days
Therefore, Debbie would have enough water for 2 days."
"Response:  If Debbie drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda every day, she will consume 79 bottles (15 + 54) of liquid each day. Since she has bought 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of soda, it means that she has enough supplies to last for:

Number of days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption
= 95 / 79
= 12.36 days
So, Debbie would have enough water supply for approximately 12.36 days if she continues to drink at the same rate."
Response:  If Debbie drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda every day, she will consume all the 162 bottles of water in 13 days (since there are 162 / 12 = 13 days worth of water consumption). Now, since she has already consumed 13 days worth of water, the remaining amount of soda that she can consume is equal to the original number of bottles of soda minus the amount of water she has already consumed. Therefore, the number of days during which the bottles of soda would be good is:  Number of days = Original number of bottles of soda - Amount of water consumed = 162 - 13 = 149 days.
"Response:  If Faye has 11 matita in each of the 14 files, then she has a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of matita} = 11 \times 14 = 154 $$
So, Faye has $154$ matita in all."
Response:  If Faye has put 12 pencils in 3 rows, then she must have put 4 pencils in each row (since there are 3 rows). So, the number of pencils Faye has put in each row is 4.
"Response:  We know that Faye had 28 packages of pencils, and each package contains 24 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she had is:

28 packets x 24 pencils/packet = 672 pencils
Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of rows she could make with 16 pencils in each row:

672 pencils / 16 pencils/row = 43 rows
So, Faye could make 43 rows of pencils."
"Response:  We know that Faye has six packages of pencils, each containing 14 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is:
6 packets x 14 pencils/packet = 84 pencils
Now, we are told that Faye is putting the pencils in rows with 22 pencils in each row. So, to find out how many rows she can make, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row:
84 pencils / 22 pencils/row = 3 rows
Therefore, Faye can make three rows of pencils."
"Response:  We know that Faye has 35 matite and 7 pastelli to color. Since she wants to put them in rows, we need to divide these numbers accordingly. To do this, let's divide 35 by 5 (the number of matite in each row):

$$ \frac{35}{5} = 7 $$

So, Faye can make $7$ rows with $5$ matite in each row. Therefore, the final answer is $7$."
Response:  We know that Faye has 4 matites and 27 pastelles in each of the 19 files. So, we can calculate the total number of matites as follows: Total number of matites = Number of files x Number of matites per file = 19 x 4 = 76 matites. Therefore, Faye has 76 matites in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has put the pencils and pens in 7 files with 36 pencils and 30 pens in each row. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pencils = 36 x 7 = 252 Number of pens = 30 x 7 = 210 Therefore, Faye has 252 pencils and 210 pens in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 files with 31 pencils and 27 pens in each row. Therefore, we have:

Number of pencils = 11 x 31 = 341 pencils
Number of pens = 11 x 27 = 307 pens
In total, Faye has 341 pencils and 307 pens."
"Response:  If Faye has 30 pens and she puts 5 pens in each row, then the number of rows she can make is:

30 / 5 = 6

So, Faye can make 6 rows with 5 pens in each row."
Response:  If Faye has 6 markers and she wants to divide them equally between two files, then each file will have 3 markers (since 6 / 2 = 3).
Response:  Since Faye had 35 packets of markers, and each packet contained 4 markers, she had a total of 35 x 4 = 140 markers.  To put these markers in rows, Faye needed to arrange them in groups of 2 markers per row. So, she could make 140 / 2 = 70 rows of markers. Therefore, Faye could make 70 rows of markers.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packs of pencils and each pack contains 6 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Since she was putting them in rows with 19 pencils in every row, the total number of rows is 186 / 19 = 9 rows. Therefore, Faye has 9 rows of pencils.
Response:  We know that Faye has put 71 pastelles and 24 markers in each of the 30 files. So, we can calculate the total number of markers as follows: Total Number of Markers = Number of Files x Number of Markers per File = 30 x 24 = 720 markers. Therefore, Faye has 720 markers in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 files and each file has 6 pastels and 21 pencils. So, we can write an equation as follows: Matte = (6 x 16) + (21 x 1). Now, let's solve for ""Matita"". To do this, we multiply both sides of the equation by 16 to eliminate the fraction: Matita = (6 x 16) + (21 x 16). Simplifying the equation gives us: Matita = 972. Therefore, Faye has 972 pencils."
Response:  We know that there are 98 students and 7 buses. Since each bus can carry a certain number of passengers (students), we need to find out how many students can fit in one bus. If we divide the total number of students by the number of buses, we get the average number of students per bus: Number of students = 98 Total number of buses = 7 Average number of students per bus = Number of students / Total number of buses = 98 / 7 = 14 Therefore, there are 14 students per bus.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 buses full of students (with 118 seats per bus). So we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Number of buses / Seats per bus Therefore, the total number of students is: Total number of students = 84 x 95 / 118 = 760 students.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classes (or rooms) at school and 66 students in each class, so we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4232 students at the school. Since there are 6 seats available on each bus, we need to divide the number of students by 6 to find out how many buses we need: 4232 / 6 = 705 buses. Therefore, we will need 705 buses for the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students (58). So, we have a total of 87 x 58 = 4960 students attending the school. Since there are only 2 seats available for every bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many buses we need: 4960 / 2 = 2480 buses needed. Therefore, we require 2480 buses to transport all the students on the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms and each classroom can accommodate 36 students (since there are 84 seats available for all classes). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:

$$ \text {Total number of students} = \frac{\text{Number of classrooms}}{ \text{Number of students per classroom}} $$
= $\frac{24}{36}$
= $6$

So, there are 6 classes in the school with approximately 6 x 36 = 216 students in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and 8 seats available in each bus. So, we need to divide the number of students by 8 to find out how many groups of 8 students we can make.  Therefore, the number of buses required is:  
$$ \text {Number of buses} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{ \text{Number of students per bus}} $$
$$ \boxed{\text{Number of buses} = \frac{102}{8}} = 13 } $$
So, we require $13$ buses for the trip."
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms at school. If we divide this number by 11 students, we get 9.36 (round up to 10). Since each bus can hold 99 students, if 8 students do not go on the trip, then 91 students will go on the trip (99 - 8 = 91). Therefore, 91 students will go on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classes at school and each class has 3 students. So, we have 72 x 3 = 216 students in total. Since there are only 3 seats available for every bus, we need to divide the number of students by 3 to find out how many buses we need. Therefore, the answer is 216 / 3 = 72 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total. Since each bus can carry a certain number of passengers (students), we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of one bus. Therefore, the number of students per bus is: Number of students / Number of buses = 92/46 = 2 Students per Bus. So, there are 2 students per bus.
Response:  If there are n students in Haley's class and each student received 9 balls, then the total number of balls given out is 9n. Since Haley gave out all the balls, she must have had x balls initially. Therefore, we can write the equation: 9n = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 9n. So, Haley had 9n balls initially.
Response:  If there are 5 students in total and each student received 5 balls from Haley, then the number of balls given away by Haley is equal to 5 x 5 = 25. So, Haley gave away 25 balls in total.
Response:  If there are 6 students in class 4 of Haley and they love playing marbles, then each student will receive 1/6 = 0.17 (marbles) from Haley. So, the number of marbles received by each student is 0.17 x 6 = 1.02 marbles.
Response:  If 13 students like playing darts and 50 students like playing cards, then together they will play with 63 game pieces (13 x 5 = 65). Since Haley has 26 dart games, she will have 47 game pieces left to share among the other 59 students (65 - 26 = 47). So each of them will receive 47/59 = 0.83 game pieces.
"Response:  If Haley has 20 biglies and there are 3 boys in her class who love playing with them, then we can divide 20 by 3 to find out how many biglies each boy will receive:

20 / 3 = 6

So, each of the 3 boys will receive 6 biglies from Haley."
Response:  If there are x number of students in the class and Haley gave 2 bigli each to every student, then the total number of bigli given out is 2x. Since there are 28 bigli in total, we can set up the equation: 2x = 28. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. So, Haley gave bigli to 14 students in the class.
"Response:  If Frank reads 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages, it will take him:

$ \text {Days} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Pages read per day}} $

So, in this case:

$$\text{Days} = \frac{392}{14} = 27 \text{ days}$$
Therefore, Frank will finish reading his favorite book in 27 days."
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages per day and it takes him 569 days to finish the book. So, we can write an equation: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, the book has 12380 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took six days to finish the book, which means he read for how many hours/days = 6 days x 24 hours/day = 144 hours. Now, we need to divide the total number of pages (612) by the time taken to read them (in hours): pages/hour = 612 / 144 = 4.25 pages/hour. So, Frank read approximately 4.25 pages every hour.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish the book and there are 5 chapters in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of chapters x Number of days taken to read each chapter So, if Frank took 220 days to finish the entire book, he must have spent approximately 4.37 days reading each chapter (220/5). Now, let's convert this time into pages: Page count = Time taken to read one chapter x Number of pages in each chapter So, the page count for each chapter is approximately 43.7 pages (4.37 x 10). Since there are 5 chapters in total, the total number of pages in the book is 218.5 pages (5 x 43.7). Therefore, the answer to the question is 218.5 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish the book, and there are 15 chapters in total. Therefore, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter as follows:

Total number of days = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter / Reading speed (in pages per day)

We are given that the book has 193 pages, so let's assume that each chapter has an equal number of pages. Therefore, the number of pages per chapter is:

Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 193 pages / 15 chapters
= 12.8 pages per chapter

Now, we can calculate how many days Frank spent reading each chapter using the formula above:

Days spent reading each chapter = Number of pages per chapter x Reading speed (in pages per day)

Since Frank read the book at a rate of 1 page per day, we have:

Days spent reading each chapter = 12.8 pages per chapter x 1 page/day
= 12.8 days per chapter

Therefore, Frank read one chapter every 12.8 days on average. Since he finished the book in 660 days, he must have read approximately 54 chapters (660 days / 12.8 days per chapter)."
Response:  If Frank took 3 days to finish each book and every book had 249 pages, then he read $pages = 3 \times 249 = 747$ pages in total. So, he read at a rate of $\boxed{pagines = 747 / 3 = 249}$ pages per day.
Response:  If each book has 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish every book, then he finished 66/12 = 5 books in one day. Therefore, he will take 492/5 = 98 days to finish all the books. So, Frank has read 98 days worth of books.
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish the book and the book has 112 pages, we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Days = 16
Pages per day = Pages in book / Days
= 112 pages / 16
= 7 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days."
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, it will take him:

576 / 8 = 72 days to finish the book."
"Response:  If Frank had 30 days to finish the book and each chapter has 450 pages, then we can calculate how many pages he read in one day as follows:

Pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days
= 41 chapters x 450 pages/chapter + introduction x 450 pages
= 17,650 pages + 450 pages (introduction)
= 18,100 pages/day

So, Frank read approximately 18,100 pages every day for 30 days to finish his favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish the book, and there are 3 chapters with 594 pages each. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Chapter 1: 594 pages x 3 chapters = 1,782 pages
Chapter 2: 594 pages x 3 chapters = 1,782 pages
Chapter 3: 594 pages x 3 chapters = 1,782 pages

So, there are 1,782 pages in each chapter."
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish the book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate the number of chapters he read in one day as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of chapters / Time taken to finish the book Time taken to finish the book = 664 days Number of chapters = Total number of chapters / Time taken to finish the book = 2 (since there are two chapters) Number of chapters per day = Number of chapters / 664 days Number of chapters per day = 2 / 664 = 0.03 Chapter per day So, Frank read approximately 0.03 chapters per day.
Response:  If we have $120 to spend and we can buy 6 DVD packs, then each pack must cost less than $20. So, the cost of each pack is: $120 / 6 = $20 per pack. Therefore, each pack costs $20.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages of DVD will cost:

$81 x 33 = $2693

Therefore, buying 33 packages of DVD will cost $2693."
Response:  If each DVD package costs $107, and there is an discount of $106 on every package, then we can calculate the cost of one package as follows: Cost = Original price - Discount = $107 - $106 = $1 Cost = $1 per package Now, if you want to know how many packages you can buy with $93, we need to divide the amount available ($93) by the cost per package ($1): Number of packages = Available amount / Cost per package = $93 / $1 = 93 packages Therefore, you can buy 93 packages of DVDs with $93.
Response:  If each DVD package costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 off every package, then we need to find out how much we have to pay for each package after applying the discount. So, the amount we have to pay = Original price - Discount = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each DVD package.
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend and each DVD costs $26, then...

$104 / $26 = 4

So, you can buy 4 DVDs with your money."
Response:  If $28 can buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package costs $14.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in Philip's collection. If we group them into pairs (or ""twos""), then we have 9 groups of 2 bananas each. So, there are 9 groups of bananas."
"Response:  If there are $X$ bananas in each group and there are $\text{140}$ groups, then the total number of bananas is given by:
$$\boxed{\text{Total number of bananas = } X \times \text{140}}$$
So, if we want to find out how many bananas Philip has in his collection, we can substitute the value of $X$, which is equal to $187$. Therefore, the final answer is:
$$\boxed{\text{Philip has } 187 \times 140 = 26,980 \text{ bananas in his collection.}}$$"
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. Since the bananas are organized into 7 groups, we can assume that each group contains an equal number of bananas (since they are equally distributed). Therefore, the number of bananas in each group is:

$$ \boxed{203 / 7 = 29} $$

So, each group of bananas contains 29 bananas. Similarly, since the oranges are organized into 95 groups, we can assume that each group contains an equal number of oranges (again, equally distributed). Therefore, the number of oranges in each group is:

$$ \boxed{63 / 95 = 0.66} $$

So, each group of oranges contains approximately 66 oranges."
Response:  We know that there are 356 oranges and they are organized into 178 groups. Therefore, each group of oranges contains an average of 2 oranges per group (since there are 356 oranges divided by 178 groups). So, if we want to find out how many oranges are in each group, we can multiply the number of oranges by the number of groups:  Number of oranges in each group = 356 x 178 = 62,080 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas and each group contains a total of 392 bananas. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  392 = 196 x n where n is the number of bananas in each group. Now, we need to find out what value of n satisfies this equation. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 196:  392 / 196 = n So, the number of bananas in each group is 2.
Response:  We know that there are 180 bananas in total in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 18. So, we need to divide this number by 18 to find out how many groups there are.  Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{18} $.
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas and they are organized into 2 groups. Therefore, there are 145 bananas in each group. Now, we need to find out how many groups of bananas Philip has. Since there are 87 oranges and they are organized into 93 groups, we can conclude that Philip has 93 - 87 = 6 groups of oranges. So, Philip has 6 groups of bananas and 87 / 6 = 14.5 groups of oranges for every group of bananes.
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. Since the bananas are organized into 345 groups, we can say that each group contains an average of 345/3 = 115 bananas. Similarly, since the oranges are organized into 16 groups, each group contains an average of 16/1 = 16 oranges. Therefore, every group of oranges has 16 oranges.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother has prepared 38 biscuits and each of them has been cut into 19 pieces for the guests, then we can calculate the total number of pieces of biscuits as follows:
Total number of pieces = Number of biscuits x Number of pieces per biscuit
= 38 x 19
= 702
Therefore, Brenda's mother has made 702 pieces of biscuits for the guests."
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 people and each person had 30 biscuits, then...

$$ \text {Number of biscuits} = \text {Total number of people} \times \text{ Number of biscuits per person } $$

So, we can write:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of biscuits}} = 14 \times 30 = 420 \text{ biscuits} $$
Therefore, Brenda's mother has prepared $420$ biscuits."
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 5 batches of biscuits and prepared 22 biscuits in total, that means she had 22/5 = 4.4 biscuits per batch.  Since she had to throw away 17 biscuits, she must have baked 22 - 17 = 5 batches. Therefore, each batch contained 4.4 biscuits / 5 = 0.88 biscuits.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 18 biscuits and 9 guests did not come, then she must have given each of the remaining 2 guests an equal number of biscuits as there were guests who didn't come (i.e., 9). Therefore, each guest received 3 biscuits (since there are 2 guests left to divide the total number of biscuits equally among them). So, the final answer is 3.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 biscuits for two guests and each guest has an equal number of biscuits as they had at the beginning, then we can write the equation:

2x + 2 = 14 (where x is the number of biscuits each guest had initially)

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 14 - 2
2x = 12
x = 7

So, each guest had 7 biscuits initially."
Response:  If there are 5 ospites and each one has received 2 biscuits, then the total number of biscuits distributed is 5 x 2 = 10. So, the mother prepared 10 biscuits for her guests.
Response:  If Frank has 42 caramelles and he wants to divide them equally between two bags, then each bag will contain half of the total number of caramelles, which is 42/2 = 21 caramelles per bag.
"Response:  If Frank had 26 bags of candies and each bag contained 33 pieces, then he had a total of:

26 bags x 33 pieces/bag = 878 pieces of candy (total)"
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 candies and he lost 24 of them. So, he has 9 remaining candies. If we divide these 9 candies into bags with 9 candies each, how many bags will he have? Therefore, Frank will have 9/9 = 1 bag.
Response:  If Frank has 11 caramels in each bag and he wants to have 22 caramels altogether, then he will need 4 bags (since 22 / 11 = 4). So, he will have 4 bags.
"Response:  If Frank has made some sweets in two identical bags, then each bag must contain an equal number of sweets. So if there are x sweets in one bag, there are also x sweets in the other bag. Since we know that Frank has 16 caramels in total, we can set up the equation:
x + x = 16
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 16
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 8
So there are 8 sweets in each bag. Therefore, there are 8 caramelles (caramel candies) in each bag."
Response:  If Shirley has sold 25 cases of truffles and each case contains 14 truffle jars, then she must have sold a total of 25 x 14 = 350 truffle jars.
Response:  If Shirley has sold 10 bags of nuts and she needs to deliver 5 bags, then there are 10 / 5 = 2 bags left over that she doesn't need to deliver. So, there are 2 bags of nuts left over after she delivers them.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 67 + 9 = 76.  Since we are asked how many more bottles of regular soda there were compared to the light version, we need to subtract the number of light bottles from the total number of bottles. Therefore, the difference between the two types of soda is:  76 - 9 = 67. So, there were 67 more bottles of regular soda than light soda.
"Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 83 (22 + 61). Now we need to find out how many bottles of diet soda there are. According to the question, ""in più"" means ""more than"", so we can assume that the number of diet soda bottles is greater than the number of regular soda bottles. Therefore, the number of diet soda bottles must be equal to or more than 22. In other words, x = 22, where x is the number of diet soda bottles. So, the answer is 22."
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of light soda. So far, we have 30 + 8 = 38 bottles. Then, we have 41 mangoes. Since each mango takes up one whole bottle, we can subtract 41 from our total number of bottles to get the remaining amount. Therefore, the final answer is 38 - 41 = -3 bottles.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of light soda. So, if we subtract the number of light soda from the total number of bottles of soda, we get:  
Total number of bottles of soda = 79 + 53 = 132  
So, the number of bottles of regular soda is equal to the total number of bottles minus the number of light soda:  
Number of bottles of regular soda = 132 - 53 = 80  
Therefore, the supermarket had 80 bottles of regular soda more than they had of light soda."
Response:  We know that there are 83 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda. So, if we subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of regular sodas, we get:  Number of regular sodas = 83 - 54 = 29. Therefore, the supermarket had 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that out of the total number of bottles (17), 9 are regular soda bottles and the rest are diet soda bottles (Light). So, the number of diet soda bottles is 9/17 = 0.53. Since there are 29 apples, we can assume that for every apple, one person drank one bottle of soda. Therefore, the number of people who drank diet soda is 0.53 x 29 = 16.43. So, the answer is 16.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 bottles of soda light and 60 bottles of regular soda. So, if we subtract the number of bottles of soda light from the total number of bottles of soda, we get:  
Total number of bottles = 60 + 19 = 79  
So, the store had 79 bottles of regular soda in addition to the 19 bottles of soda light."
Response:  We know that there are 78 mele and we have already counted 32 bottiglie of soda light. So, if we subtract 32 from 78, we get 46. Therefore, the number of additional mele is 46.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is equal to 36 + 80 + 54 = 160 bottles. Now we need to find out how many bottles of apples there are. From the question, we know that the store had 36 apples. So, the ratio of bottles of apples to bottles of soda is 36/160 = 1/4. Therefore, the store has one more bottle of apple than bottle of soda.
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles of drink in total and 28 are regular soda bottles. So, we can say that the number of light soda bottles is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, the number of Diet Coke bottles consumed is 2.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 bottles of regular soda. So, if we divide the number of regular soda bottles by the number of diet soda bottles, we get:  
$$ \frac{79}{4} =? $$
Solving for $x$, we get:  
$$ x = 19 $$
So, the supermarket had 19 bottles of regular soda more than the diet soda."
Response:  We know that there are 57 bottles of regular soda and 26 bottles of light soda. So, altogether we have 57 + 26 = 83 bottles of soda. Therefore, they took 83 bottles of soda in total.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of light soda. So, if we subtract the number of light soda from the total number of bottles of soda, we get: 81 - 60 = 21. Therefore, there are 21 bottles of regular soda more than the light soda.
Response:  We know that there are 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of Diet Soda Light. So, we can write an equation as follows: Regular Soda = 49 - 40 = 9 bottles of Diet Soda Light. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular soda is equal to 9 times the number of bottles of Diet Soda Light. In this case, the number of bottles of regular soda is 9 x 6 = 54 bottles. So, the total number of bottles of both types of soda consumed is 49 + 54 = 103 bottles.
Response:  If there were 295 visitors the day before and after eating a hearty meal they went to see Buckingham Palace, then the number of visitors that day must be greater than 295. So, we can say that the difference between the number of visitors that day and the previous day is equal to the total number of visitors minus 295. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of visitors that day = Total number of visitors - 295  Answer: 317
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before, and Rachel found out about it after eating a hearty meal, then the number of visitors must have increased by at least 246 (the difference between 703 and 457) since the last time she checked. Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 25 days is:  
$$ \boxed{703 + 246 = 949} $$"
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before, and then 666 more visitors came that day, we can calculate the total number of visitors as follows:
Total Number of Visitors = Day Before + Additional Visitors
= 100 + 666
= 766
Therefore, there were 766 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day, including both the previous day's 100 visitors and the additional 666 visitors who came that day."
Response:  We know that in the last 327 days, 406 people have visited Buckingham Palace. So, if we want to find out how many visitors came to the palace the day before, we can use the following formula: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit x (Number of days since the last visit - 1)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of visitors = 406 / 327 x (327 - 1) = 135 Therefore, 135 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before Rachel went there.
Response:  If 45 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before, that means 829 - 45 = 784 people have visited in total over the last 85 days. So, if 829 people have visited the palace in the last 85 days, then 829 / 85 = approximately 10 people visited the palace that day (round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the answer is 10 visitors per day.
"Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings at Buckingham Palace. If Rachel knew that 557 visitors had arrived at the palace that day, then the average number of visitors per day is:

$$ \text{Average daily visitors} = \frac{\text{Total number of visitors}}{\text{Number of days}} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Average daily visitors} &= \frac{557}{57} \\ &= 9 \end{aligned} $$
So, on average, 9 visitors visited Buckingham Palace every day for 57 days."
Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings at Buckingham Palace. If we assume that each painting takes up an area of 1 square meter, then the total area of all 39 paintings is 39 square meters.  Now, let's find out how many visitors visited the palace on the day after Rachel went there. According to the question, if there were 600 visitors the day before, then the number of visitors on the day after would be 661 - 600 = 61 more visitors. So, the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel went there is 61 more than the number of visitors who visited the previous day.
Response:  We know that there were 419 visitors the day before, and then 92 more visitors arrived that day. So, in total, there were 419 + 92 = 511 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the two days combined.
"Response:  We know that in the last 89 days there were 471 visitors one day, 808 visitors another day, and 512 visitors today. So, we can write an equation:

Day 1 = 471
Day 2 = 808
Day 3 = 512

Now, let's solve for the total number of visitors in the last 89 days:

Total = Day 1 + Day 2 +... + Day 89
= 471 + 808 +... + 512
= (471 x 89) + (808 x 89) + (512 x 89)
= 406,710 + 697,640 + 432,880
= 1,536,230

So, in the last 89 days, a total of 1,536,230 people visited Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  If there were 191 visitors the day before, then the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days is:

191 + (245 - 1) = 368

If there were 457 visitors the day before, then the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days is:

457 + (245 - 1) = 699

Now, let's find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous 245 days:

Difference = Number of visitors that day - Total number of visitors in the previous 245 days
= 705 - 699
= 6

Therefore, 6 more visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous 245 days."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required for all the feathers is 628 grams and we have already used 159 grams of wax to glue the first set of feathers. So, the remaining amount of wax needed to glue all the feathers is:

628 - 159 = 469 grams

Therefore, the number of grams of wax he has left is 469 grams."
"Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of colors to paint the feathers and we have already used 260 grams of wax for the feathers. So, the amount of wax left is:  
49 grams - 260 grams = 191 grams"
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed for the feathers is 353 grams and we have been given that the wax required per feather is 57 grams. Therefore, to find out how many feathers he has already colored, we can divide the total amount of wax used so far by the amount of wax required per feather: Number of feathers = Total amount of wax / Amount of wax per feather = 353 grams / 57 grams = 6 So, the person has already colored 6 feathers.
"Response:  If he needs 166 grams of wax to attach 16 feathers and he has 20 grams of wax, how many grams of wax does he need to attach 4 feathers?  We can calculate this as follows:

Number of feathers = 16 (from the question)
Amount of wax needed = 166 grams (from the question)
Number of feathers he has = 4 (from the question)

So, he needs 4 x 166 / 16 = 37 grams of wax to attach 4 feathers."
"Response:  If he has 557 grams of wax and needs only 17 grams in total for the feathers, then we can calculate how much wax is needed for each feather as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = Number of feathers x Amount of wax needed per feather
= 557 grams / 17 grams per feather
= 32 feathers

So, he needs 32 feathers worth of wax."
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required for gluing is 492 grams and our current amount of wax is 11 grams. To find out how many more grams we need, we can divide the total amount by the current amount: 492 / 11 = 45 grams. So, he needs an additional 45 grams of wax.
Response:  We know that the winemaker has saved the harvesting of grapes for his last stop and that he has been told that 94 collectors have filled 90 barrels of wine in 6 days. To find out how many barrels are filled each day, we can divide the total number of barrels filled by the number of days:  Number of barrels filled/day = Total number of barrels filled / Number of days = 90 barrels / 6 days = 15 barrels/day
Response:  We know that there are 266 grape collectors who fill 90 barrels of wine in 5 days. So, we can calculate how many barrels each collector fills per day as follows: Number of barrels filled per day = Total number of barrels filled / Number of days = 90 barrels / 5 days = 18 barrels per day. Therefore, 18 barrels of wine were filled every day.
Response:  We know that there are 294 grape collectors who fill 244 barrels of grapes per day and 47 barrels of lampone per day. To find out how many barrels of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we need to divide the total number of barrels by the number of days. So, we have: Number of barrels of grapes filled = Total number of barrels / Number of days = 244 + 47 = 301 barrels. Therefore, in 146 days, approximately 301 barrels of grapes would be filled.
Response:  We know that there are 235 grape collectors who fill 100 barrels of wine per day and 221 barrels of grapes per day. To find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled in 77 days, we can use the following formula: Number of barrels = Total number of days x Average amount of grapes collected per day So, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this formula, we get: Number of barrels = 77 days x (235 grape collectors x 100 barrels/day) + (221 barrels/day x 77 days) = 77 x 23500 + 16499 = 208,499 barrels Therefore, in 77 days, approximately 208,500 barrels of grapes will be filled.
"Response:  If he saved $57 worth of wine and they told him that 252 workers were collecting grapes to fill 108 barrels per day, then we can calculate how many barrels would be filled in 58 days as follows:

$57 \times 365 = 20,925 barrels

So, in 58 days, approximately 20,925 barrels of wine would be collected."
Response:  If they can fill 8 barrels of wine per day with 36 pickers, it means that in one day they will collect 36 x 8 = 288 pounds of grapes. Therefore, to collect 240 barrels of wine, it would take them approximately 240 / 288 = 81 days.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 aquari for saltwater animals and each aquarium has the same number of animals as every other aquarium. So, if we divide the total number of saltwater animals (52) by the number of aquari (26), we get the average number of animals in each aquarium: 52 / 26 = 2.
Therefore, each aquarium has an average of 2 saltwater animals."
Response:  We have 40 animals of saltwater fish in different aquariums. Since each aquarium has two animals, we can say that the total number of aquariums is equal to half of the total number of animals (i.e., 40 / 2 = x). Therefore, there are x aquariums. So, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquari for saltwater animals and 10 for freshwater animals. So, in total he has 66 aquari. Now we need to find out how many saltwater animals Tyler has. Since each aquarium contains 39 animals, then the number of saltwater animals Tyler has is equal to the number of aquari he has multiplied by the number of animals in each aquari. Therefore, the number of saltwater animals Tyler has is 66 x 39 = 2748.
"Response:  We know that Tyler has 74 aquari for animals of fresh water and 22 for saltwater animals. Since each aquarium contains 46 animals, we can calculate the total number of animals in all the aquari as follows:
Total number of animals = Number of freshwater aquari x Number of animals per aquari + Number of saltwater aquari x Number of animals per aquari
= 74 x 46 + 22 x 46
= 3180 + 952
= 4132
Therefore, Tyler has 4132 animals in his aquari."
Response:  We have 15 aquari for saltwater animals and 62 for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 19 animals, so we need to find out how many animals are in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of aquari for each type of animal:  Saltwater animals: 15 x 19 = 285 Freshwater animals: 62 x 19 = 1138 Total animals: 285 + 1138 = 1423 Therefore, there are 1423 animals in total.
Response:  If we buy 13 white shirts in a package, then we have 13 packages of white shirts. So if Mom buys 39 white shirts, she will have 39 / 13 = 3 packages of white shirts.
Response:  If the mom buys 66 white shirts and each package has 3 white shirts, then... (1) $ $ $ = 66 / 3 = 22 packages of 3 shirts each. So, she will have 22 packages.
Response:  If the mother buys 28 packs of white shirts and each pack contains 56 white shirts in total, then we can calculate how many white shirts are in each pack as follows: Number of white shirts in each pack = Total number of white shirts / Number of packs = 56 white shirts / 28 packs = 2 white shirts per pack. Therefore, there are 2 white shirts in each pack.
Response:  If Mamma buys 57 packs of white shirts and each pack contains 53 shirts, then she will have 57 x 53 = 2913 white shirts.
Response:  Mamma buys 51 white shirts. Each package of 3 shirts can be bought how many times? We need to divide 51 by 3: $51 / 3 = 17$ packages of 3 shirts each. So, Mamma will have 17 packages of white shirts.
"Response:  If Mamma buys 70 white shirts in total and each package can contain X shirts, then we know that:

$$ \text {Number of packages} = \frac{\text{Total number of shirts}}{\text{Number of shirts in each package}} $$

We are given that Mamma buys 14 packages, so we can write:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of shirts in each package}} = \frac{\boxed{\text{Total number of shirts}}}{ \boxed{\text{Number of packages}} } = \frac{70}{14} = 5 $$

Therefore, there are $5$ shirts in each package."
Response:  We have 4 bags with an equal number of cookies and a total of 36 cookies. So, if we divide the total number of cookies equally among the four bags, each bag will contain 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9). Therefore, each bag has 9 cookies.
Response:  We have 33 biscotti in total and each bag has 11 biscotti. To find out how many bags we have, we can divide the total number of biscotti by the number of biscotti in each bag: 33 / 11 = 3 bags. So, we have 3 bags of biscotti.
"Response:  If every bag has 41 biscuits and you have 53 bags of biscuits, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many biscuits are in one bag.

41 biscuits / 1 bag = x biscuits per bag (where x is the number of biscuits in each bag)

Step 2: Multiply the number of biscuits in each bag by the total number of bags you have.

x biscuits per bag x 53 bags = total number of biscuits

So, if there are 41 biscuits in each bag and you have 53 bags of biscuits, then you would have a total of 41 x 53 = 2193 biscuits!"
Response:  We have 14 biscotti in total and each bag has the same number of biscuits as there are bags. So, if we divide the total number of biscuits (14) by the number of bags (n), we get the number of biscuits in each bag: $ \frac{14}{n} $. Since there are 7 bags, we can find out how many biscuits are in each bag by multiplying $\frac{14}{7}$: $ \boxed{\text{7}} $. Therefore, each bag contains 7 biscuits.
"Response:  If every bag has 3 biscuits and you have 21 bags in total, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many biscuits are in each bag.
Number of biscuits per bag = Total number of biscuits / Number of bags
= 21 biscuits / 21 bags
= 1 biscuit per bag

So, there is one bag of biscuits for every 1 biscuit.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many bags you have.
You have 21 bags in total.

Therefore, the answer to your question is: You have 21 bags of biscuits."
Response:  We have 26 sachets with an equal number of cookies. So we can assume that each sachet contains x cookies. Since there are 15 candies and 52 cookies in total, we know that x + 15 = 52. Solving for x, we get x = 37. Therefore, you have 37 bags of cookies.
Response:  We have 14 bags of cookies with an equal number of biscuits each. If we have 28 biscuits and 86 candies altogether, that means there are 86 - 28 = 58 candies left over after distributing all the biscuits. So, if we divide 58 candies equally among 14 bags, each bag will contain 4 candies. Therefore, you have 14 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If there are 5 pieces of trash per block and our postal worker gives out 25 letters to each house in an islet, then we need to divide 25 by 5 to find out how many houses there are in one islet. So, the number of houses in one islet is 25 / 5 = 5.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in an isolate, and each house needs to receive 9 pieces of trash mail, then the total number of pieces of trash mail that need to be delivered is 20 x 9 = 180 pieces of trash mail. Therefore, the postal worker must deliver 180 pieces of trash mail to every isolate.
Response:  If there are 6 houses in an islet and each house needs to receive 24 pieces of trash mail from the postman, then the number of pieces of trash mail that the postman must deliver to each house is 24/6 = 4. So, the postman must give 4 pieces of trash mail to each house.
"Response:  If there are 14 pieces of junk mail delivered to each house in an islet, and the postman must give two pieces of junk mail to every block, then we can calculate how many houses are in one islet as follows:

Number of houses = Total number of pieces of junk mail / Number of pieces of junk mail per house
= 14 x (2 + 1) / 2
= 14 x 3 / 2
= 28

Therefore, there are 28 houses in an islet."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in an islet and each house needs to receive 32 pieces of trash mail, then the total number of pieces of trash mail that need to be delivered to all houses in the islet is 640 (20 x 32).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pieces of trash there are in total. Since there are 78 isolated and each has 30 pieces of trash, then the total number of pieces of trash is:

78 x 30 = 2340

Now, let's divide this amount among the 19 houses in one isolated:

2340 / 19 = 123

So, each house should receive 123 pieces of trash."
Response:  We have to deliver 8 pieces of trash to each of the 55 isolated areas. If we give 32 letters to every house in an area, how many houses are there in one area? Therefore, there are 55 x 8 = 440 houses in total.
Response:  We have to deliver 4 pieces of trash to each of the 81 plots. Since there are 12 houses in each plot, we will give 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of trash in total. So, the answer is 48.
Response:  If there are 17 houses in each of the 16 alleys, then the total number of houses is 16 x 17 = 252 houses. Since the mailman has to deliver 4 pieces of trash to each house, he will have to deliver a total of 252 x 4 = 1008 pieces of trash. Therefore, the correct answer is 1008.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 balls. If she wants to divide them into groups of 4, how many groups can she make?

To do this, we need to divide both numbers (eggs and balls) by 4.

10 / 4 = 2.5 (number of groups)
20 / 4 = 5 (number of balls per group)

So, Rebecca will be able to create 2.5 groups with 5 balls each. Therefore, there will be 2.5 groups in total."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 bags and 15 eggs to divide into groups of 5. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide 15 by 5. So, we have:  15 ÷ 5 = 3   Therefore, Rebecca will be able to create 3 groups of 5 eggs each.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the collection of eggs into groups of 11, then she will have to divide 100 eggs (since there are 100 eggs in total). Since each group has 2 eggs, Rebecca will have to make 50 groups ( since 100 / 2 = 50). Therefore, Rebecca has 50 groups of eggs.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and 6 bags. If we want to divide them into 4 groups of equal size, we need to find out how many eggs each group can hold. To do this, we will use division. So, let's divide 8 by 4: 8 ÷ 4 = 2. Therefore, each group can hold 2 eggs. Now, let's check if our calculation is correct: Group 1 has 2 eggs, Group 2 has 2 eggs, Group 3 has 2 eggs, and Group 4 has 2 eggs too! Yes, our calculation was correct!
Response:  We have 15 eggs and we want to divide them into 3 groups of equal size. Since Rebecca has 4 bags, each bag can hold 4/3 = 2/3 of an egg. So, if we divide 15 eggs equally among 3 groups, each group will get 15 / 3 = 5 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of six. So we need to find out how many groups we can make with 18 eggs.  To do this, we divide 18 by 6: 18 / 6 = 3. Therefore, Rebecca will be able to create 3 groups of 6 eggs each. Now let's move on to the other ingredients: bananas and biglies. Since there are 72 bananas, we can give 12 bananas per group (72 / 6 = 12). And since there are 66 biglies, we can give 11 biglies per group (66 / 6 = 11). So Rebecca will have 3 groups of eggs (3 x 6 = 18), 12 groups of bananas (12 x 7 = 84), and 11 groups of biglies (11 x 7 = 77).
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the collection of eggs into groups of 3. So we need to find out how many groups we can make with 3 eggs.  To do this, we will use multiplication. If we have 3 eggs and we want to group them into sets of 3, then we can create 1 set. Therefore, if Rebecca has 99 eggs, she can create 99 / 3 = 33 groups of 3 eggs each.  Now let's move on to the other items. If Rebecca has 9 bananas and she wants to distribute them equally among the groups of eggs, then she can give 1 banana per group. Therefore, if she creates 33 groups of 3 eggs each, she will give 33 x 1 = 33 bananas altogether.  Finally, if Rebecca has 27 biglies and she wants to distribute them equally among the groups of eggs and bananas, then she can give 1 bigli per group of eggs and 1 bigli for every 3 groups of bananas (since there are 33 groups of bananas). Therefore, if she gives 1 bigli per group of eggs, she will give 33 x 1 = 33 biglies overall.  In conclusion, Rebecca can create 33 groups of 3 eggs each, giving her 33 bananas and 33 biglies in total.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of 5. So we need to find out how many groups she can make with the given number of eggs and baskets.

Let's use division to solve this problem:

Number of eggs = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per group
= 20 eggs / 5 eggs per group
= 4 groups

So, Rebecca has 4 groups of eggs, which means she has 4 x 5 = 20 eggs in more than the number of baskets (6). Therefore, the answer is 14 eggs."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 baskets and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20 eggs each, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with her available resources. To do this, we can use division. So, let's divide 12 (the number of eggs) by 20 (the desired group size):

12 / 20 = 0.6

This means that Rebecca can make approximately 0.6 groups of 20 eggs using her 5 baskets and 12 eggs. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we will round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Rebecca has 3 extra eggs beyond what she needs for one group."
"Response:  If Luke has scored 154 points and gained 11 points in each round, then he must have played x rounds. We can write an equation to represent this situation: 154 = x \* (11 + 0) where ""x"" is the number of rounds played. Since there are no zeroes in the equation, we know that x is a positive integer. Therefore, the solution to the problem is x = 13. So, Luke played 13 rounds."
"Response:  If Luke has played 177 rounds of a game and earned 46 points in each round, then he has scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{177} 46 = 8032 $$

Therefore, Luke has scored $8032$ points in the game."
"Response:  If Luke has scored 84 points after playing two rounds of a game of questions and answers, then he must have scored an equal number of points in each round. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Luke's score = (Number of points scored in Round 1) + (Number of points scored in Round 2)

Since Luke has played two rounds, we know that the total number of points he has scored is 84. So, we can set up the equation again:

(x + y) = 84

Where x represents the number of points Luke scored in his first round, and y represents the number of points he scored in his second round. Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 42 (y = 42)

Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in his first round and 42 points in his second round, for a total score of 84 points."
Response:  If Luke has gained 146 points in each round of the game, then he has scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,892 points in the entire game.
Response:  If Luke has won 3 points for each round he played and he has won 78 points in total, then he must have played 26 rounds (78 / 3 = 26).
Response:  If Emily has 2 perls and can make 32 chains, then she needs to have 32/2 = 16 perls for each chain. Therefore, there are 16 perles needed for every collar.
Response:  If Emily is making bracelets for her friends and each bracelet contains 28 perles, then she has made 11 bracelets in total. So, the number of perls Emily had is equal to the number of bracelets she made multiplied by the number of perls in each bracelet. Therefore, we can write: Number of perls = Number of bracelets x Number of perls in each bracelet  In this case, the number of perls is: Number of perls = 11 x 28  Number of perls = 308 perls.  So, Emily had 308 perls.
Response:  If Emily is making bracelets for her friends and each bracelet has 8 pearls, then she can make 8 bracelets in total. But the question states that she has 16 perles, so she can actually make twice as many bracelets. Therefore, Emily can make 16 bracelets.
Response:  We know that Emily can make 18 collars and she has 6 pearls. To find out how many pearls are needed for each collar, we need to divide the total number of pearls (6) by the number of collars (18). So, there are 6/18 = 0.33 pearls needed for each collar.
Response:  We know that Emily made 4 collanes and each collane has 5 perles. So, in total, Emily had 4 x 5 = 20 perls.
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 perles and each collar can have up to 3 perls. So we need to find out how many times 6 goes into 3 x number of collars. In this case, 3 x 72 = 216. Therefore, Emily can make 216 collages with her 6 perls.
Response:  If Emily has 5 perles and she can make 20 collanes, then each collar needs 4 perls (since 20 / 5 = 4). So, to every collar, there are 4 perls needed.
Response:  We know that Emily is making bracelets for her 44 friends and she has already made 26 of them. So, if she wants to make one more bracelet for each friend, she will need 44 - 26 = 18 more perls. Therefore, Emily had 18 perles in total.
"Response:  We know that out of 819058 children in the county of Lawrence, 819058 went to summer camp. So, the number of children who stayed at home is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who went to camp. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:

Number of children staying at home = 819058 - 819058
= 0

So, there are no children left behind at home. All 819058 children from the county of Lawrence went to summer camp!"
Response:  We know that there are 100,000 children in the county of Lawrence. Of these, 20,000 go to summer camp, leaving 80,000 children at home. So, the number of children remaining at home is 80,000 - 20,000 = 60,000. Therefore, there are 60,000 children left at home compared to those who went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898,051 children in the county of Lawrence. During summer holidays, 629,424 children go to camp and the remaining ones stay at home. So, we need to find out how many children remain at home. To do this, we can use division. The number of children who remain at home is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who go to camp. Therefore, the number of children who remain at home is: 898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627. Thus, there are 268,627 children who remain at home during the summer holidays in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in the county of Lawrence. During summer break, 274,865 children stay at home, which means that 38,608 children go to camp (313,473 - 274,865).
Response:  We know that out of 907611 children in the county of Lawrence, 455682 go to summer camp. So, we can calculate the number of remaining children as follows:  Number of remaining children = Total number of children - Number of children who went to summer camp = 907611 - 455682 = 451939. Therefore, there are 451939 children left at home in the county of Lawrence during the summer holidays.
"Response:  We know that during summer holidays, 8000 bambini (children) from the county of Lawrence go to camping and the rest stay at home. The county of Lawrence has 828521 children altogether. So, we can calculate how many children are left at home as follows:

Number of children remaining at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camping
= 828521 - 8000
= 748521
Therefore, there are 748521 children who remain at home in the county of Lawrence."
Response:  We know that during summer break 61619 children from the county of Lawrence are staying at home while the rest went to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of children who stayed at home = 91676 - x Where x is the number of children from the county of Lawrence who went to camp. Since we want to find out how many children from the county of Lawrence went to camp, we can set up the following inequality: 61619 > x (greater than) This means that more than half of the children from the county of Lawrence went to camp. Therefore, the answer is greater than or equal to 30854 (since 61619 is greater than 30854).
Response:  We know that:  - 34 044 children from the county of Lawrence go to summer camp.  - 13 4867 other children stay at home.  - 424944 children from outside the county participate in the camp. So, we can calculate the total number of children who went to the camp as follows: Total = (County children) + (Other children) + (Outside children) Total = 34 044 + 13 4867 + 424944 = 59 078 Children Therefore, there were 59 078 children who attended the summer camp.
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children in the county, 608543 (or 99%) go on summer vacation and stay at home, while 22 (or 0.3%) go to camp. Therefore, the number of children who stay at home is: 608543 - 22 = 606321. So, there are 606321 children in the county who stay at home during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that out of 644997 children in the county, 893835 have gone to summer camp. This means that 644997 - 893835 = 251062 children are left at home. Since we also know that 78 children from outside the county participated in the camp, this means that the total number of children in the county is 251062 + 78 = 251840. Therefore, there are 251840 children in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  If Adam has 9 melons and he gave 3 to Jackie, then Jackie got 9 - 3 = 6 melons.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, if we add their number of apples together, we get:  Adam - 10 = 2 + 2 = 14 apples. Therefore, Adam has 14 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  If Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples, then Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam. So, the difference between their number of apples is 1. Therefore, Jackie has 1 + 9 = 10 apples more than Adam.
Response:  If Jackie has 10 songs and Adam has 8 songs, then we can say that Jackie has 2 more songs than Adam (10 - 8 = 2). So, Jackie has 2 more songs than Adam.
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have together 6 mangoes, then they have 3 mangoes each (since 6 / 2 = 3). Now, if they put their mangoes together, Adam has 4 more mangoes than Jackie (given that Jackie has 3 mangoes). So, Adam has 7 mangoes (4 + 3 = 7). Therefore, Jackie has 3 mangoes.
"Response:  If Adam has x mele and Jackie has y mele, together they have ax + by = 7. Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 3 (since Adam has 3 mele)
y = 4 (since Jackie has 4 mele)
Therefore, Adam has 3 mele and Jackie has 4 mele. So, together they have 3 + 4 = 7 mele."
Response:  We know that Insieme (together) have 12 apples. Then, Adam and Jackie together have 9 more apples than Insieme. So, they have 12 + 9 = 21 apples. Now, we know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Therefore, Jackie has 21 - 8 = 13 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. Together they have 2 apples. If we add Adam's apples to Jackie's apples, then Adam has 6 apples in total. So, Adam has 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 5 apples and Jackie has 89 oranges plus 11 apples. So, if we subtract the number of oranges from the total number of fruits that Jackie has, we will get the number of apples that Adam has. Therefore, the answer is:  Apples = 89 - 11 = 78
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 31 biscuits. Today, she made 270 biscuits. And yesterday (the day before), she made 419 biscuits. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 31 + 270 + 419 = 650. Therefore, until last night, Helen had made a total of 650 biscuits.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 90 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she made 51 wine-raisin cookies and 484 chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen has made 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, Helen has made 625 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen has made a total of 527 + 86 = 613 biscuits so far (including both types). Then she made another 86 biscuits today, bringing the total to 613 + 86 = 700 biscuits. So, Helen has made 700 biscuits of chocolate chip cookies in total.
Response:  We know that Helen has made a total of 144 + 397 = 541 biscuits so far (yesterday and today). This includes both types of biscuits - uva passa and cioccolato. So, if she has made 85 biscotti di uva passa yesterday, then she must have made 541 - 85 = 456 biscotti di cioccolato yesterday. Similarly, if she has made 403 biscotti di cioccolato today, then she must have made 456 - 403 = 123 biscotti di uva passa today. Therefore, Helen has made 123 biscotti di uva passa.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 19 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she made 237 chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen has made 256 chocolate chip cookies (19 + 237). Now, let's compare this number to the number of fruit-based cookies that Helen has made. According to the question, Helen has made 231 fruit-based cookies (passionfruit and apricot). Therefore, there are more chocolate chip cookies than fruit-based cookies (256 - 231 = 25).
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 apricot jam cookies. Today, she has made 75 chocolate chip cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies for a total of 141 chocolate chip cookies made yesterday in addition to today. So, the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen made yesterday is 141 - 197 = -56.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 519 chocolate cookies and today she made 280 uvetta cookies. So, yesterday, Helen made more uvetta cookies than chocolate cookies (519 - 280 = 239).
"Response:  We know that Katie has played 81 games and her friends have played 59 games. So, we can calculate the difference between their number of games as follows:

Difference = Katie's games - Friends' games
= 81 - 59
= 22

Therefore, Katie has played 22 more games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has played 91 games and her new friends have played 88 games together. So, the total number of games played by Katie and her new friends is 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now, we also know that Katie's old friends have played 53 games together. Therefore, the total number of games played by all of Katie's friends (old and new) is 179 + 53 = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie had 78 new games and 86 old games, so together she had 78 + 86 = 164 games.  Now we are told that her friends had 48 new games, so together they had 48 + 0 (since there were no old games) = 48 games. Therefore, together Katie and her friends had 164 + 48 = 212 games.
Response:  We know that Katie had 84 new games and 19 old games, so together she had 103 games (84 + 19).  Now we are told that her friends had 8 new games and 69 old games, so together they had 77 games (8 + 69).  Therefore, altogether Katie and her friends had 180 games (103 + 77).
Response:  We know that Katie had 80 old games and her friends had 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:  63 - 57 = 6 Therefore, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie had 57 new games and 39 old games, for a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Now we are told that Katie's friends had 34 new games. So, the total number of games owned by Katie's friends is 34 + 39 = 73 games. Therefore, Katie has 96 - 73 = 23 more games than her friends.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19. Then, Jason washed cars during the weekend and now has $33. So, if Jason had $19 before he washed cars, then he must have gained $14 ($33 - $19). Therefore, Jason has earned $14 by washing cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 last week and then he spent $20 to wash machines during the weekend, so now he has $66. Then, we know that Jason had $5 last week and didn't work, so he still has $5. Now, let's add up the amount of money they have together: $66 + $5 = $71. Therefore, they have $71 together.
Response:  We know that at first, Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. Then they washed machines during the weekend and now Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So, we can calculate how much money Fred gained as follows:  $40 - $19 = $21  Therefore, Fred gained $21 during the weekend.
Response:  We know that at first, Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. Then they washed machines during the weekend and now Fred has $21 and Jason has $78. So, we can calculate how much Jason gained as follows:  Jason's initial amount = $22  Amount of money Fred gave to Jason = $78 - $22 = $56  Therefore, Jason gained $56 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 dollars and Jason had $40 dollars last week. Then, during the weekend, Fred laundered machines and gained $4 dollars. So now he has $115 dollars. On the other hand, Jason delivered newspapers and lost $6 dollars, so now he has $44 dollars. Therefore, the amount of money they earned from washing cars is $4 ($115 - $111).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 dollars and Jason had $3 dollars. Then, during the weekend, Fred laundered machines and earned $73 dollars, so now he has $112 dollars. Secondly, we know that Jason delivered newspapers and earned $30 dollars, so now he has $63 dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Jason made delivering newspapers is $30 - $3 = $27 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 dollars and he gave $14 to Fred during the weekend. So now Jason has $31 - $14 = $17 dollars left.  Then, we know that Fred had $78 dollars and he spent some of it to wash his machines during the weekend. So now Fred has $78 - x dollars where x is the amount he spent on washing his machines. Since Fred didn't mention anything about giving money to Jason, we can assume that he kept all the $78 dollars for himself. Therefore, Jason's earnings from delivering newspapers are $17 + $78 = $95 dollars per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 dollars last week and then he earned $16 from delivering newspapers. So his new amount of money is $33 + $16 = $49. Then, he worked as a machine washer and earned $74 dollars. Therefore, his final amount of money is $49 + $74 = $123. So, Fred gained $123 in the weekend.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $47 last week and then he made $111 delivering newspapers and $34 washing machines. So his new total amount of money is: $47 + $111 + $34 = $282. Therefore, Fred has $282 now.
"Response:  Jessie started at 71 kg and lost 20 kg after starting to do jogging every day. So, her current weight is:

$71 - 20 = 51 \text{ kg}$"
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 27 kg (chili). After running every day for some time, she lost 101 kg. So, her current weight is 27 + (-101) = 17 kg. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 17 kg.
"Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed x kilograms. Since she has lost 126 kilograms after running every day, her original weight must have been:
x - 126 = 66
Solving for x, we get:
x = 192
Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 192 kilograms."
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 69 kg or 152 lbs. Since she started running every day, let's assume that she lost weight at a constant rate of 0.5 kg per week (which is a reasonable estimate for a beginner). Therefore, after one week, Jessie would have lost 0.5 kg = 500 grams = 0.5 lb. After two weeks, she would have lost another 0.5 kg = 500 grams = 0.5 lb, and so on. So, after 3 weeks, Jessie would have lost a total of 1.5 kg = 1500 grams = 1.5 lb. And after 4 weeks, she would have lost an additional 1.5 kg = 1500 grams = 1.5 lb, bringing her total loss to 3 kg = 3000 grams = 3 lb. Finally, after 5 weeks, she would have lost yet another 1.5 kg = 1500 grams = 1.5 lb, resulting in a total loss of 4.5 kg = 4500 grams = 4.5 lb. So, if Jessie has been running every day for 5 weeks, she would currently weigh 64 kg or 141 lbs, which is a loss of 5 kg or 11 lbs from her initial weight of 69 kg or 152 lbs.
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 114 chili (or kilograms). Then she started doing jogging every day and lost weight at an incredible rate - 50 kg in the first week and another 60 kg in the second week! So after two weeks of jogging, Jessie now weighs...  Okay, let's calculate:  First week: 114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg Second week: 64 kg - 60 kg = 8 kg  Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 8 kg or 17.6 lbs.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 chili (the initial weight). Then, during the first week of running, she lost 62 chili (a portion of her initial weight), so now she weighs 9 - 62 = 53 chili. During the second week, she lost an additional 140 chili, bringing her total weight loss to 140 + 62 = 202 chili. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 53 chili.
Response:  After one week of jogging, Jessie lost 56 kg (first week). Then, after another week of jogging, she lost an additional 99 kg, for a total loss of 155 kg (second week). So, after the first week of jogging, Jessie weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kg.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 95 snakes in the cage and 61 alligators. If 64 of them hid themselves, then we have:

Snakes = 95 - 64 = 31
Alligators = 61

So, out of the total number of snakes (31), 64 hid themselves, leaving 27 snakes unhidden."
Response:  We know that there were 93 snakes and 97 alligators in total. If 40 of them (alligators) hid themselves, then we have to subtract this number from the total amount of alligators. So, the remaining alligators are: $97 - 40 = 57$ alligators. Now, let's check how many snakes are left after hiding 40 alligators. Since each snake needs an alligator to bite it, if 40 alligators hide themselves, then they will not be able to bite any snakes. Therefore, the number of snakes left is equal to the initial number of snakes minus the number of alligators that can still bite them: $93 - 40 = 53$ snakes.
Response:  We know that initially there were 75 alligators and 3 snakes in the cage. If we add 82 snakes and 19 alligators to this number, then the total number of alligators will be:  75 + (82 x 1) = 157 alligators. So, out of the 157 alligators, 19 are hiding, leaving 138 alligators that are not hidden.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 animals in total in the enclosure with snakes and alligators. If 24 snakes and 51 alligators were hiding, then we can deduce that the number of animals not hiding is equal to the total number of animals minus the number of snakes and alligators hiding. Therefore, the number of animals not hiding is:

$$ \boxed{79 - (24 + 51)} = 79 - 75 = 4 $$
So, there were 4 animals that were not hiding in the enclosure."
Response:  If the farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and took 134 of them yesterday, then he has 37 tomatoes left today (171 - 134 = 37).
Response:  Yesterday, he had 160 tomatoes and took 56 of them. So today, he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left.
Response:  If the farmer had 90 tomatoes yesterday and took 154 yesterday, then he has taken 67 tomatoes (154 - 90) from his garden. Today, if he has taken 50 tomatoes from his garden, then he has taken a total of 117 tomatoes (67 + 50) from his garden. So, the number of tomatoes the farmer has collected in total is 117.
"Response:  The farmer had initially 175 pomodori and 77 patates in his garden. If he has collected 172 patatoes, then the number of remaining patates is:

$$ \text {Number of remaining patates} = \text{Initial number of patates} - \text{Number of patates collected} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of remaining patates} = 77 - 172 $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ \text {Number of remaining patates} = -95 $$

So, there are no remaining patates. Now let's find out how many pomodori the farmer has left:

$$ \text {Number of remaining pomodori} = \text{Initial number of pomodori} - \text{Number of pomodori collected} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of remaining pomodori} = 175 - 0 $$

So, the farmer has $175$ pomodori left in his garden."
Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he has collected 53 tomatoes, then we have to subtract that number from the initial amount of tomatoes he had. So, the number of tomatoes left is:  177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes. Now, let's check how many potatoes are left. We know that the farmer had initially 12 potatoes, so if he has collected 53 tomatoes, then he must have also collected some potatoes. However, we don't know exactly how many potatoes he collected, since it doesn't say anything about it in the question. Therefore, we can assume that he collected an equal number of potatoes as he did tomatoes, which means he collected 53 potatoes as well. So, the total number of potatoes left is:  12 + 53 = 65 potatoes. Thus, the farmer now has 124 tomatoes and 65 potatoes in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he has collected 137 tomatoes, then he must have collected some of both types of tomatoes. So, let's calculate how many green and red tomatoes are left in the garden. Green tomatoes = 105 - (137 / 2) = 68 Red tomatoes = 71 - (137 / 2) = 49 Therefore, there are 68 green tomatoes and 49 red tomatoes remaining in the garden after the farmer has collected 137 tomatoes.
Response:  If John uses 4 chiodi to fix the walls of his house and each piece of wood needs two nails to be fixed, then he will need 8 pieces of wood to fill one wall. Since there are four walls in a house, John will need 32 pieces of wood to build an entire house.
Response:  We know that for each wall of the house, John will use 13 large wooden beams. Each beam needs 17 nails to be fixed, so we need 229 nails (13 x 17 = 229) for all the beams. However, some of the beams are smaller, and they require 8 additional nails each. So, in total, John will need 247 nails (229 + 8 x 3 = 247) to fix the walls of the house.
Response:  If John used 11 chiodi to cut big beams of wood for the walls of the house, and each beam needs 3 chiodi to be fixed, then he has used a total of 11 x 3 = 33 chiodi.  Since there were 8 additional chiodi used for other purposes, that means John has used a total of 33 + 8 = 41 chiodi. Therefore, John needs 41 / 3 = 13 assi (beams) to complete the wall of the house.
"Response:  We know that big boards need 15 nails and small boards need 5 nails. So, if we use 12 big boards and 10 small boards, we will need a total of:

12 x 15 = 180 nails for big boards
+ 10 x 5 = 50 nails for small boards
= 230 nails in total
Therefore, John needs 230 nails to fix the wall with the panels."
Response:  We know that each tavola needs 2 chiodi to be fixed and John will use 16 tavole for the wall of the house. So, we need to calculate how many chiodi John will use in total.  Therefore, the number of chiodi needed by John is:  16 tavole x 2 chiodi/tavola = 32 chiodi.
"Response:  If John needs to fix 8 big tables of wood for the walls of his house and each table requires 74 nails to be fixed, then he will need in total:

8 big tables x 74 nails/table = 592 nails

So, John needs 592 nails to fix all the tables for the walls of his house."
Response:  We know that John needs to attach 12 large boards and 17 smaller boards to the walls of the house. Each large board requires 14 nails, so we need 12 x 14 = 168 nails for the large boards. Similarly, each small board requires 25 nails, so we need 17 x 25 = 425 nails for the small boards. In total, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 nails to attach all the boards to the wall.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of chewing gum in total and each package has 3 pieces. So, to find out how many packages Robin has, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each package: 42 / 3 = 14 packages. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of chewing gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of tires and each package contains 23 pieces of tire. So, the total number of pieces of tire that Robin has is: 43 x 23 = 1006. However, we are also given that Robin has 8 extra tires, so the total number of pieces of tire that Robin actually has is: 1006 + 8 = 1014. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1014.
Response:  We know that Robin has six pieces of gum in addition to the seven pieces in each package. So, he has a total of 6 + 7 = 13 pieces of gum. Since there are 41 pieces of gum in total, we can set up the equation: 13 + x = 41. Solving for x, we get: x = 28. Therefore, Robin has 28 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and 13 packages of candy. Since each package contains 4 pieces of gum or candy, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Gum: 28 packages x 4 pieces/package = 112 pieces Candy: 13 packages x 4 pieces/package = 52 pieces Therefore, Robin has a total of 164 pieces of gum and candy.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of tires and 45 packages of caramels. Since each package contains 9 pieces of caramel, we can write:

Number of pieces of caramel = Number of packages x Number of pieces per package
= 21 x 9
= 189 pieces of caramel
Therefore, Robin has 189 pieces of caramel."
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of tires and 14 packages of candy. Since each package contains 6 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

Number of tire packages = 28
Number of pieces per package = 6
Total number of pieces = Number of tire packages x Number of pieces per package = 28 x 6 = 168
Therefore, Robin has 168 pieces in total."
"Response:  We know that the machine can make 3 shirts per minute. So if it has made 6 shirts in total, this means that it must have worked for x minutes, where x is the number of shirts produced divided by the number of shirts produced per minute. Therefore, we can write:
x = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes
So, the machine worked for 2 minutes to produce 6 shirts."
"Response:  If the machine has worked for 5 minutes and it can make 4 shirts per minute, then in those 5 minutes the machine has made:

$ Number of minutes = 5 $
$ Number of shirts per minute = 4 $

So, the total number of shirts produced by the machine is:

$ Total number of shirts = Number of minutes x Number of shirts per minute $
= 5 x 4 $
= 20 $

Therefore, the machine has produced 20 shirts during the 5-minute period."
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 camisoles, so it worked for x minutes. Today, the machine made 44 camisoles, so it worked for (44-9) = 35 minutes more than yesterday. Therefore, the total time the machine worked yesterday is 9 + 35 = 44 minutes.
Response:  If the machine made 13 camisoles yesterday and 3 today, then it has produced a total of 16 camisoles (13 + 3).  Since the machine makes 8 camisoles per minute, we can calculate how long the machine worked as follows: Time = Total number of camisoles / Number of camisoles per minute = 16 / 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  If the machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 today, then it has made a total of 17 shirts in two days (9 + 8 = 17). Since the machine makes 2 shirts per minute, it has worked for 17/2 = 8 minutes today. Therefore, the machine worked for 8 minutes today.
Response:  If yesterday the machine made 4 shirts per minute and today it made 8 shirts per minute, then we can say that the increase in production is 2 shirts per minute (from 4 to 8). So, if the machine worked for x minutes yesterday, it will work for 2x minutes today. Therefore, the number of minutes the machine worked today is: 2x.
Response:  If the machine can make 6 shirts per minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday, it made 6 x 12 = 72 shirts yesterday.  And if it worked for 14 minutes today, it made 6 x 14 = 84 shirts today. So, in total, the machine has made 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can make 6 shirts per minute and worked for 5 minutes yesterday, it made 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). And if it worked for 12 minutes today, it also made 72 shirts (6 x 12 = 72). So, in total, the machine made 102 shirts (30 + 72) today.
Response:  If they made the same amount of money every day, we can write this as: $/day = total amount / number of days. So if they earned $165 in 5 days, we can set up the equation like this: $/day = $165 / 5 = $33/day. Therefore, they made $33 per day.
"Response:  If they made $144 per day and were at the carnival for 22 days...

$144/day x 22 days = $3,088

So, in total, they made $3,088 at the carnival."
"Response:  The party made $420 in 30 days playing the ring toss game, and they also won $22 from the game itself. So, to find out how much the game paid per day, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of days played:

$420 / 30 = $14 per day

Therefore, the ring toss game paid $14 per day."
Response:  First 44 days = $382 + (last 10 days x $374) = $382 + $3740 = $4116. Therefore, they have made $4116 in total.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much money they made in total during the Carnival period. According to the question, they made $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days, for a total of:

$120 + $66 = $186

Now, let's calculate their daily earnings during the Carnival period. To do this, we divide the total amount earned by the number of days they were open for business:

$186 / 46 days = $4.07 per day

Therefore, they made approximately $4.07 per day during the Carnival period."
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much money they made in total during the Carnival period. According to the question, they made $325 in the first 154 days and $114 in the remaining 57 days, for a total of:

$325 + $114 = $449

Now, let's calculate how much they made per day during the remaining 57 days of the Carnival period:

$449 / 57 = $8.06

Therefore, they made $8.06 per day during the remaining 57 days of the Carnival period."
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cakes, then she must have bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packs of baked goods. Therefore, Lucy has bought 14 packets of biscuits in addition to the ones mentioned in the question.
Response:  Lucy bought 4 packets of biscuits, which means she bought 4 x 22 = 88 packets of other food items (since each packet contains 22 biscuits). Therefore, she has bought a total of 88 + 16 = 104 packets of groceries.
Response:  If Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of cakes (torte), then she must have bought at least 23 + x packages of cakes, where x is the number of packages of cakes she bought. Since we are told that she had a total of 27 packages of food, this means that x = 4. So, Lucy bought 4 packages of cakes.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 2 packages of cookies and 12 packages of cakes. So she has purchased a total of 2 + 12 = 14 packages of baked goods. Since each package contains 6 biscuits or cakes, Lucy has purchased a total of 14 x 6 = 84 baked goods in total. Therefore, the answer is 84.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people on the bus. Then, 4 more people got on at the next stop, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people on the bus. Since each bus can have no more than 36 people, we know that there cannot be more than 36 - 16 = 20 people on the bus right now. Therefore, there are exactly 20 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people on the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus and 3 people got off. So, now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people on the bus. Then, 9 more people got on the bus. So, now there are 4 + 9 = 13 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 4 more people got on (including the person who asked the question). So, now there are 11 + 4 = 15 people on the train.
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents and 676 people in total. To find out how many students were at the program, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 students at the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents and 724 students in the program. To find out how many people were present at the program, we need to add the number of teachers to this total. Therefore, the answer is:  Parents + Students = 73 + 724 = 797 people.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students. To find out how many more students than parents there were, we need to subtract the number of parents from the number of students:  521 - 174 = 347 Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students. The program could accommodate 44 people. So, we need to find out how many people are more than the capacity of the program.  To do this, we subtract the number of people who could be accommodated (44) from the total number of people involved in the program (288): 288 - 44 = 244. Therefore, there were 244 people present at the program.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we have to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave. So, if we divide the distance we need to travel (1307) by the depth of the cave (919), we get the answer: $ \boxed{14}$. Therefore, the finish line is 14 times deeper than the starting point.
"Response:  They are currently at an altitude of 849 feet and they want to reach the cave which is 1218 feet deep. To find out how much more distance they have to cover, we can subtract their current altitude from the desired altitude:

Distance = Desired Altitude - Current Altitude = 1218 - 849 = 369 feet

So, they still need to travel 369 feet to reach the cave."
Response:  We are already at 659 feet and we need to go down another 103 feet (from 762 feet) to reach the end of the cave. Therefore, we still have 103 feet to go.
Response:  We know that 6 fish were left after the cats had eaten some of them. So, initially there were 8 fish and then 6 remained. Therefore, the number of fish that disappeared is 8 - 6 = 2.
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 red fish and 12 catfish in the pond initially. If the stray cats are eating them with pleasure, then the number of remaining fish will be equal to the initial number minus the number of fish eaten by the cats. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of remaining fish = Initial number - Number of fish eaten by cats Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of remaining fish = 7 + 12 - x Where x is the number of fish eaten by the cats. Since the cats have already eaten 3 fish (as mentioned in the question), we can substitute this value in the equation: Number of remaining fish = 7 + 12 - 3 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 fish left in the pond after the stray cats have eaten some of them.
Response:  We know that Paige had initially 16 red fish and 71 catfish in the pond. The stray cats are eating them with pleasure, so we can assume that all of the catfish (71) have been eaten. Therefore, the number of red fish left is equal to the initial amount minus the number of catfish eaten = 16 - 71 = -55. So, there are -55 red fish missing.
Response:  We know that Paige has raised 15 fish in the pond and that five of them have been eaten by stray cats. To find out how many fish are left, we need to subtract the number of fish eaten from the total number of fish raised. So, the answer is:  Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish eaten = 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are ten fish remaining in the pond.
Response:  At the beginning, the baker had 43 meles and after making some tarts he had 2 more meals. So, if he used 2 meals, then he must have started with 41 meals (43 - 2 = 41).
Response:  If the chef had initially 58 apples and used 35 of them to make tarts, then there are remaining 23 apples (58 - 35 = 23).
Response:  We know that initially the chef had 40 apples and 54 peaches. If he made 12 tarts using these fruits, then he must have used all of his 40 apples. So, the number of apples left after making the tarts is 40 - 12 = 28. Now we can calculate the number of peaches used in making the tarts. Since there were 54 peaches originally, and the chef made 12 tarts, the number of peaches used per tart is 54 / 12 = 4. Therefore, the chef used 4 peaches to make each of the 12 tarts. So, the total number of peaches used is 4 x 12 = 48. Finally, since the chef had 39 apples left after making the tarts, we can conclude that he used none of his original 54 peaches.
Response:  If Adam can put 11 action figures on each shelf, and his room has 4 shelves, then he can have a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures on all the shelves together. However, since there are also 40 closets in the room, we need to subtract that number from the total amount of action figures to find out how many are on the shelves. So, the final answer is 44 - 40 = 4 action figures on the shelves.
"Response:  If Adam could put 10 action figures on each shelf of his room and his room can hold 8 action figures in total, then we need to find out how many shelves he has. So, let's divide the number of action figures that Adam can put on each shelf (10) by the total number of action figures that his room can hold (8):

$ \frac{10}{8} = $2.5 $\text {shelves}$

So, Adam had 2.5 shelves in his room."
Response:  If Adam can put 8 action figures and 10 dressers on each shelf, then he has 8 x 4 = 32 action figures and 10 x 4 = 40 dressers in total. So, in his entire room, Adam could have 32 + 40 = 72 objects.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 vases. So, the total number of vases is 544 x 10 = 5440. Since each vase contains 32 flowers, the total number of flowers is 5440 x 32 = 176,800. Therefore, there are 176,800 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 466 vases and each vase contains 53 flowers and 181 stems. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of flowers = Total number of vases x Number of flowers per vase Number of stems = Total number of vases x Number of stems per vase Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,980 Number of stems = 466 x 181 = 87,366 Therefore, there are approximately 24,980 flowers and 87,366 stems in total.
Response:  We know that there are 141 pots and each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 sticks. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers per pot To find out how many flowers there are altogether, we need to multiply the total number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot. Therefore, the total number of flowers is equal to 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers.
Response:  We know that every vase contains 40 flowers, and there are 400 flowers in total. Therefore, we can divide the number of flowers by the number of vases to find out how many vases there are: 400 / 40 = 10. So, there are 10 vases in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 gummies. If we divide the number of gummies by the number of groups (154), we get: Number of gummies per group = 4276 / 154 = 28. So each group contains approximately 28 gummies.
Response:  Since there are 3941 Skittles and 4950 gumballs, we can say that each group of gumballs will contain an equal number of gumballs as there are Skittles. Therefore, if we divide the total number of gumballs (4950) by the number of groups (3941), we get: $ \boxed{ Group size = 4950 / 3941 = 12 }$ So, each group contains 12 gumballs.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steven's collection. If we divide this number by 8 (the number of groups), we get:  Number of Skittles per group = 896 / 8 = 112 Skittles per group.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then there are 270/5 = 54 classes. Since every class has the same number of students, there are 54 x 5 = 270 students in total. Therefore, there are 270 grades in total.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class  Total number of students = 304 x 75  Total number of students = 22,700  Therefore, there were 22,700 students in total at the school.
