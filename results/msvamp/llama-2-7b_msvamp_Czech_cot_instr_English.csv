Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 18 children. On Tuesday, she played with 10 children. So, in total, Julia played with more than 18 children (the number of children she played with on Monday) but fewer than 28 children (the sum of the numbers of children she played with on both days). Therefore, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 11 children. In Tuesday, she played with 12 children more than in Monday (since there are 12 - 11 = 1 more child). So, Julia played with 11 + 1 = 12 children in Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with five children on Monday and then she played with another child on Tuesday. If she had played with 15 children, we would know that number of children she played with on Monday plus the number of children she played with on Tuesday is equal to 15. So, if Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 1 child on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 6 children (5 + 1 = 6).
Response:  Julia played with kids in Monday and Tuesday. If she played with 14 kids on Tuesday, then she must have played with more than 14 kids on Monday. So, if she played with 16 kids on Tuesday, then she must have played with at least 16 + 14 = 30 kids on Monday. Therefore, Julia played with 30 kids on Monday.
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children in Monday and more than 12 children in Tuesday, then she must have played with at least 13 children in Tuesday. So, Julia played with 13 children in Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 14 children in total. On Monday she played with more than 8 children, so let x be the number of children she played with on Monday. Since she played with fewer children on Tuesday (8), we can write an equation: 14 - x = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 6. So Julia played with 6 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday, she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday, she played with only two children. So in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, she played with 33 children in total (15 + 18). Now, we are asked how many children she played with on Pondělí (Monday) and Úterý (Tuesday). Therefore, the answer is 33.
Response:  On Monday (pondělí), Julia played with five children.  On Tuesday (úterý), she played with nine children.  And on Wednesday (středa), she played with fifteen children. So, to find out how many children Julia played with in both days, we need to add the number of children she played with on each day:  Five + nine = fourteen. Therefore, Julia played with fourteen children on Monday and Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with two children on Monday (2), 14 children on Tuesday (14), and 16 children on Wednesday (16). So, she played with 14 + 16 = 30 children in total between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with 9 children on Monday, 7 children on Tuesday and 96 children on Wednesday. So, we need to find out how many children Julia played with more than on Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the total number of children she played with on Monday:  Number of children Julia played with more than on Tuesday = Total number of children Julia played with - Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday  = 96 - 7 = 89 Therefore, Julia played with 89 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday, she played with 2 children. On Wednesday, she played with 8 children. So, in total, Julia played with more than 14 children on Monday and fewer than 8 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 14 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with eight children. So, she had more children to play with than on Wednesday (11). And on Thursday, she had fewer children to play with than on Wednesday (9). Therefore, Julia played with more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Julia played with 15 children each day. So, she played with 30 children in total (15 + 18). But on Wednesday, she only played with 7 children. Therefore, Julia played with more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday. The difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday and the number of children she played with on Wednesday is 23 (30 - 7).
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday, she played with 10 children. In the middle of the week (Wednesday), she played cards with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (pondělí), Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday (úterý), she played with 13 children. And on Wednesday (středa), she played cards with 20 children. So, in total, Julia played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children.
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 12 children for x hours. Then, on Tuesday, she played with 14 children for y hours. We know that the total time Julia spent playing tag was 34 hours. So we can set up an equation:
x + y = 34... (1)
We also know that the number of children Julia played with on both days is equal to the sum of the numbers of children she played with each day:
12 + 14 = 26... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns! Can you solve them to find out how many children Julia played with each day?"
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 19 children and spent 38 hours playing on roller skates.  In Tuesday, she played with 18 children and also spent 38 hours playing on roller skates. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children Julia played with on Monday = 19  Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = 18 Total number of hours Julia spent playing on roller skates = 38 Now, let's solve for the variable ""Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday"": Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = Total number of hours Julia spent playing on roller skates / Number of hours Julia spent playing with each child on Tuesday Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = 38 / (19 + 18) = 38 / 37 = 1 Therefore, Julia played with more than 19 children on Tuesday."
Response:  In Wednesday (Úterý), Julia played with 5 children.  In Monday (Pondělí), she played with 6 children. So, in Monday, Julia played with more than 5 children. Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 5 children.
Response:  Julia played with 4 children on Monday and also played with some other children on Tuesday. So, if we assume that she played with all of them simultaneously, then she played with 4 + x = 18 children in total, where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Since there are only 3 days between Monday and Tuesday (i.e., Wednesday), we can conclude that x = 2, meaning Julia played with 4 + 2 = 6 additional children on Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 + 2 = 6.
Response:  On Monday (pondělí), Julia played with 6 children and on Tuesday (úterý), she played with 17 children. So, Julia played with more than 6 children on Monday. Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 6 children.
"Response:  If Bobby started with eating some number of pieces (let's call it x) and then he ate additional 25 pieces, we can write this as:

Bobby ate x + 25 = 43 pieces of candy.

Now, we need to find out what value of x will make this equation true. We know that x + 25 = 43 is equal to 17 (since 17 + 25 = 43). So, we have:

x + 25 = 17

Subtracting 25 from both sides gives us:

x = 17 - 25

Simplifying, we get:

x = -8

So, Bobby started with -8 pieces of candy."
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of bonbons and then he ate another 42 pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of bonbons.  Then, he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the final number of pieces of bonbons that Bobby ate is 70.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy (bonbons). Then he ate 4 more pieces of candy. Finally, he ate 14 pieces of chocolate. So in total, Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy and 14 pieces of chocolate.
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36. So far, he has eaten a total of 74 pieces of candy (38 + 36 = 74). Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 74 + 16 = 90. So, Bobby sneeled more than 3 times as many sweets as he did chocolate.
Response:  Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces. So far, he has eaten 34 + 20 = 54 pieces of candy. Then, he ate another 18 pieces, so in total, he has eaten 54 + 18 = 72 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby sneled 72 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces. So, he has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy (bonbons). Then he ate some and after that, he ate another 5 pieces. So, if he has 8 pieces left now, we can calculate how many he ate at the beginning as follows: Number of pieces eaten = Total number of pieces - Remaining pieces = 22 - 8 = 14 Therefore, Bobby ate 14 pieces of candy (bonbons) at the beginning.
Response:  Bobby had 19 pieces of candy. If he ate two pieces, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces left. So, Bobby still has 17 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them. The number of pieces of candy he ate is equal to the number of pieces he has left minus the number he originally had. So if he has 20 pieces of candy left, then he must have eaten 12 pieces (32 - 20 = 12).
"Response:  Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy. He then ate 17 pieces and later ate another 15 pieces. So, how many pieces of candy does he have left? We can use subtraction to find out!

Let X be the number of pieces of candy that Bobby has left after eating all those pieces.
We know that Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy, so X = 36 - (17 + 15) = 36 - 32 = 4 pieces of candy.
Therefore, Bobby has 4 pieces of candy left."
Response:  If Bobby had originally 30 pieces of candy and he ate 23 of them, then he has 7 remaining (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  We know that Alan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. So, we can write this as an equation: 5 = x + 3 where 'x' is the number of balloons that Jake brought. Now, we are asked how many more balloons did Alan have than Jake in the park. To find out, we subtract the number of balloons that Jake brought from the total number of balloons brought by Alan: 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Alan had 2 more balloons than Jake in the park.
"Response:  We know that Alan brought two balloons to the park and Jake brought three balloons to the park. So, we can write this as an equation:

2 = x (where ""x"" represents the number of balloons that Jake had more than Alan)

Now, we are asked how many balloons Jake had more than Alan. To find out, we need to solve for ""x"". Can you see how to do this?"
Response:  If Alan brought three balloons to the park and he brought two of them, then Jake must have brought one balloon to the park. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons to the park and he brought 4 more than Allan, then Allan brought x balloons to the park. Since Jake brought 6 balloons in total, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake = 6... view the full answer
Jake brought 6 balloons to the park.
If Jake brought 4 more than Allan, then Allan brought x balloons to the park.
Let's think step by step.
If Jake brought 4 more than Allan, it means that Allan brought x - 4 balloons to the park (since Jake brought 4 more).
So, the number of balloons Allan brought is equal to x - 4.
Now, we know that Jake brought 6 balloons in total, so the sum of the number of balloons brought by both Jake and Allan must be equal to 6 + (x - 4) = 10.
Therefore, the number of balloons Allan brought to the park is x = 10."
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 more than Alan, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 11 - 5 = 6 additional balloons to the park compared to Alan.
"Response: 
Alan brought 3 balloons and Jake brought 5 balloons to the park. So together they had 3 + 5 = 8 balloons in the park. Then Alan bought two more balloons in the park, so now he has 2 + 8 = 10 balloons. Therefore, Alan has 10 balloons in the park, and Jake has 8 balloons in the park."
"Response: 
Alan brought two balloons and Jake brought four balloons to the park. So together they have six balloons in the park (2 + 4 = 6). 
Then Alan bought three more balloons in the park, so now he has nine balloons (6 + 3 = 9).  Therefore, Alan has nine balloons more than Jake in the park."
Response:  We know that Alan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 8 balloons (2 + 6 = 8). Now, we are told that Allen bought additional three balloons in the park. So, now there are 11 balloons in total (8 + 3 = 11). Therefore, Jake has more than Allan in the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 11 - 8 = 3. So, Jake has 3 more balloons than Allan in the park.
"Response: 
Allen brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. So in total they have 9 balloons (5 + 4).  Then Allen bought additional three balloons at the park, so now he has 12 balloons (9 + 3). Therefore, Allan brought 12 balloons to the park."
"Response: 
Alan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 2 balloons to the park. So together they have 8 balloons (6 + 2 = 8).  Then Jake bought additional three balloons in the park, so now he has 5 balloons (2 + 3 = 5). Now we need to find out how many balloons does Alan have more than Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of balloons that Jake has from the total number of balloons that Alan had: 8 - 5 = 3. Therefore, Alan has 3 more balloons than Jake in the park."
"Response: 
Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 more. So, in total, Jake had 6 + 3 = 9 balloons at the park.  Then, Jake bought additional 4 balloons in the park. Therefore, Jake had 9 + 4 = 13 balloons more than Alan in the park."
"Response: 
Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. So far, they have 11 balloons (5 + 6) in total. Then, Jake bought additional three balloons at the park, so he has 3 more balloons than Alan. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Jake brought to the park is: 11 + 3 = 14."
Response:  We know that Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park. So, he had 3 + 20 = 23 items in total. Now, we are told that Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the park. So, he had 5 + 59 = 64 items in total. Therefore, the number of balloons that Alan and Jake had together at the park is 23 + 64 = 87 items.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park. So, he had a total of 12 items (7 balloons + 5 balls).  Now, we know that Jake brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park. So, he had a total of 10 items (6 balloons + 4 balls). Therefore, the number of balls that Alan and Jake had in the park together is: 12 + 10 = 22 balls.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and he and Jake together took 6 balloons, then Jake must have brought 1 additional balloon to the park. So, Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more, he had a total of five balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5).  If Jake brought six balloons to the park, that means he had six balloons more than Allan did (6 - 5 = x), where x is the number of balloons Jake brought. So, the answer is x = 1.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, in this case, Ryan spends 6 + 2 = 8 hours studying both languages. Therefore, he spends 8 - 2 = 6 hours more studying English than Chinese.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many hours he spends studying Chinese more than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, if he spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese, then he spends a total of 13 hours (6 + 7) studying both languages. Therefore, he spends 13 - 6 = 7 hours studying Chinese more than English.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and also studies Chinese for some additional time each day, then he spends x hours studying Chinese per day. Since he spends a total of 4 hours studying both languages each day, we can write an equation as follows:

x + 3 = 4... (1)

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4 - 3

x = 1

So, Ryan spends 1 hour studying Chinese each day."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and a few more hours studying Chinese, then he must spend x hours studying Chinese if he spends y hours studying English more than he does Chinese. We know that y is greater than 0 because Ryan spends more time studying English than he does Chinese. So we can write an equation:
x = 7 - y
Now we have to solve for x. To do this, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:
x = -y + 7
Now we have our final solution:
x = -y + 7
So if Ryan spends 2 hours more than he does studying English than he does studying Chinese, then he must spend 9 hours studying Chinese (since -2 = 9)."
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and a few more hours studying English. If he spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, then we can write an equation as follows: 5 + x = 7 (where x is the number of hours Ryan spends studying English) Now, let's solve for x: 5 + x = 7... Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us: x = 2 So, Ryan spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese, then he spends in total 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day studying both languages together.  Now, if he studies for 5 days, he will spend in total 13 x 5 = 65 hours studying both languages together during those 5 days.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese, then he spends in total 6 + 5 = 11 hours per day studying languages.  Since he studies two days, he spends altogether 2 x 11 = 22 hours studying languages during those two days.
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours studying English every day and 4 hours studying Chinese every day, then he spends a total of 9 hours (5 + 4) studying each day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, Ryan spends a total of 63 hours (9 x 7) studying both languages together over the course of a week.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent in total:

Total time spent learning English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 324 hours
Total time spent learning Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours
So, Ryan spends 324 hours per week learning English and 504 hours per week learning Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day. So he spends 6/1 = 6 hours studying English per day.
He also spends 7 hours studying Chinese and 3 hours studying Spanish. Therefore, he spends 7 + 3 = 10 hours studying Chinese and Spanish combined.
So in total, Ryan spends 6 + 10 = 16 hours studying languages every day."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day.  He also studies Chinese for 3 hours per day and Spanish for 58 hours per day. To find out how many hours he spends studying English more than Chinese, we need to subtract the time he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages.
So, if Ryan spends 6 hours studying English + 3 hours studying Chinese = 9 hours (total).
Now, let's compare this with the time he spends studying Spanish: 58 hours.
Therefore, Ryan spends 58 - 9 = 49 hours more studying Spanish than he does studying Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish. So, in total, he spends 7 + 2 = 9 hours studying languages every day. Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends studying English more than Spanish. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the total number of hours he spends studying languages: 9 - 4 = 5 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours more studying English than Spanish."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day. So he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week studying English.
He spends 5 hours studying Chinese and 4 hours studying Spanish, so he spends 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week studying Chinese and 4 x 7 = 28 hours per week studying Spanish.
Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying Chinese than Spanish. The difference in hours is 35 - 28 = 7 hours per week."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and he studies Chinese for 2 hours when he doesn't study English, then we can write an equation as follows:

English = 3 hours/day
Chinese = 2 hours/day - English

Now let's solve this equation to find out how many hours Ryan spends studying Chinese per day:

Chinese = 2 hours/day - 3 hours/day = -1 hour/day

So Ryan does not spend any time studying Chinese per day!"
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 + 5 = 9 hours per day studying both languages together. So, Ryan spends 9 hours per day studying English and Chinese.
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 bags of plastic bottles for recycling. If she found additional 7 bags of plastic bottles on Tuesday, then in total, she had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of plastic bottles. So, there were more than 8 bags of plastic bottles on Tuesday compared to Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she found 7 pails of plastic bottles. If she finds additional 12 pails on Tuesday, then the total number of pails she found is:  7 + 12 = 19 pails. Therefore, she found 19 pails of plastic bottles in two days.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 containers of plastic bottles for recycling. If she found additional 3 containers on Tuesday, then the total number of containers is 7 (4 + 3). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  If Tiffany had 2 pairs of containers for recycling on Monday (let's call them Pair 1 and Pair 2), then she must have had 2 + 4 = 6 containers in total on Monday. So, she had 6 containers on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she had 10 bags of plastic. Then, on Tuesday, she found 3 more bags of plastic and on Wednesday, she found 7 more bags of plastic. So, in total, she had 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 bags of plastic. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.
"Response:  On Monday (pondělí), she found 8 bags of plastic bottles. If she found x bags on Tuesday and y bags on Wednesday, then we can write an equation:

x + y = 10... (1)

Since she found 10 bags in total, we know that x + y = 10. Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 5
y = 5

So, Tiffany found 5 bags of plastic bottles on Monday, 5 bags on Tuesday, and 5 bags on Wednesday."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had three pails of plastic bottles for recycling. If she found additional 7 bags of plastic bottles and 44 bags of cans on Tuesday, how many pails did she have in total?  Total number of pails = Number of pails on Monday + Number of pails found on Tuesday  Total number of pails = 3 + 7 = 10  So, Tiffany had 10 pails of plastic bottles for recycling.
Response:  We know that there are more red apples than green ones in the basket. So, if there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples, then we can say that the number of red apples is greater than the number of green apples by 1 (17 - 16 = 1). Therefore, there are one more red apple in the basket than green apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red beans and 11 green beans in the basket. So, if we divide the number of green beans by the number of red beans, we get:  
Green beans / Red beans = 11/5 = 2.2  
So, there are 2 more green beans than red beans in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are ten red beets in the basket and some green ones too. If we have 15 beets in total, then the number of red beets is 10/3 = 3. So, there are 3 red beets in the basket. Now, let's find out how many green beets are left. Since there were some green beets already in the basket before adding more, we can assume that the number of green beets is equal to the original number minus the number of red beets. Therefore, the number of green beets is 15 - 3 = 12. So, there are 12 green beets in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are three red apples and some green apples in the basket. If there are more than 10 green apples than red ones, then we can say that there are x green apples. Since there are 3 red apples, we have:

x + 3 = 10... (1)

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract equation (1) from both sides of the equation:

x = 7... (2)

So, there are 7 green apples in the basket."
Response:  We have sedm (7) red beans, patnáct (15) yellow beans and osm (8) green beans in the basket. So, we can say that there are 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 beans in total in the basket. Therefore, the number of beans in the basket is 30.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red beans and 70 yellow beans in the basket.  To find out how many green beans are in the basket, we can use the following equation: Number of green beans = Total number of beans - Number of red beans - Number of yellow beans In this case, the total number of beans is 7 + 70 = 77 beans. So, if we subtract the number of red beans (7) and the number of yellow beans (70), we get: Number of green beans = 77 - 7 - 70 = 30 green beans Therefore, there are 30 more green beans than red beans in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 green beans in the basket more than yellow ones. So, we can write it as follows:

Green = 14 - Yellow

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

Green = 14 - 6
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 green beans in the basket more than yellow ones."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red beans in the basket and 11 yellow beans. So, we can write this as an equation:

Red beans = 19
Yellow beans = 11

Now, let's find out how many more red beans than yellow beans there are:

More red beans = Red beans - Yellow beans
= 19 - 11
= 8

So, there are 8 more red beans than yellow beans in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red beans in the basket and 32 green beans (6 + 32 = 48). So, we can conclude that there are 48 - 6 = 42 green beans in the basket. Therefore, there are 6 red beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red beans in total. So, if we subtract the number of yellow and green beans from 18, we will get the number of red beans. Therefore, the number of red beans is:  Red beans = Total number of beans - Number of yellow beans - Number of green beans  Red beans = 18 - 14 - 17  Red beans = 6  So, there are 6 red beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red beans in the basket and 14 yellow beans. So, if we subtract the number of red beans from the total number of beans, we get: Total number of beans = 5 + 14 = 19. Now, let's find out how many green beans are in the basket: Number of green beans = Total number of beans - Number of red beans = 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 green beans and 14 yellow beans in the basket.
"Response:  We have 65 boxes of beans. Each box contains 7 red beans and 3 green beans. So, in total we have:

7 x 65 = 455 red beans
3 x 65 = 195 green beans
Therefore, there are 455 + 195 = 650 beans in all 65 boxes."
Response:  We have 11 baskets of brussels sprouts. Each basket contains 10 red Brussels sprouts and 18 green ones. So, in total, we have 11 x 10 = 110 red Brussels sprouts and 11 x 18 = 208 green Brussels sprouts. Therefore, there are 110 + 208 = 318 Brussels sprouts in all 11 baskets combined.
Response:  We have 6 baskets of brussels sprouts. Each basket contains 16 red Brussels sprouts and 18 green ones. So, in total we have:  6 baskets x 16 red Brussels sprouts/basket = 96 red Brussels sprouts  6 baskets x 18 green Brussels sprouts/basket = 108 green Brussels sprouts Total number of Brussels sprouts = 96 + 108 = 204 Brussels sprouts. Therefore, there are 204 Brussels sprouts in all six baskets.
Response:  We have 7 baskets of beans. Each basket has 10 red beans and 2 green beans. So, in total we have 7 x 10 = 70 red beans and 7 x 2 = 14 green beans. Therefore, there are 14 green beans in all the baskets combined.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 red broccolis and 3 green broccolis in each basket. So, if we have 7 broccolis altogether, then...

Answer: There must be 2 baskets of broccoli (since 7 / 4 = 1.75 is an integer). Therefore, there are 2 baskets with 4 red broccolis and 3 green broccolis each, for a total of 8 broccolis."
Response:  We know that there are two baskets of brussels sprouts and each basket has either 4 red or 4 green brussels sprouts. Since we have a total of 12 brussels sprouts in all the baskets, let's assume that the number of green brussels sprouts is x. Then, since each basket has either 4 red or 4 green brussels sprouts, the number of red brussels sprouts is 12 - x. So, the answer to your question is x = 6. Therefore, there are 6 green brussels sprouts in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are 16 broccolis in total and we have already counted 13 red ones. So, if there are still some green ones left, then their number is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green broccolis in the basket.
"Response:  If each basket has 19 red and 4 green apples, then in total there are:

19 x 19 = 361 red apples
4 x 4 = 16 green apples

So, in 15 baskets, there will be:

361 + 16 = 377 apples (including both red and green)"
"Response:  We know that there are 10 broskvi in total and they are distributed evenly among 5 košíků. Since each košík has 4 red and 6 green broskvi, we can calculate the number of broskvi in each košík as follows:
Red broskvi: 4 x 5 = 20Green broskvi: 6 x 5 = 30Total number of broskvi: 20 + 30 = 50Therefore, there are 50 broskvi in total."
"Response:  We know that there are more than twice as many yellow beans as red beans in the basket. So if there are x red beans, then there are 2x yellow beans. Since there are 3 colors of beans altogether (green, yellow, and red), we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 2x = 60...(1)

We also know that there are 6 green beans in the basket. Therefore, we can substitute this value into equation (1):

6 + 2(60) = 60...(2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for x, we get:

x = 40

So there are 40 red beans in the basket. As for the number of green beans, we already knew that there were 6 of them. Therefore, the final answer is:

Number of green beans = 6
Number of red beans = 40"
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures initially on his desk in the room. Later, he added more action figures to the pile. If he now has a total of 8 action figures on the desk, then he must have added 4 additional action figures. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Jerry had 5 action figures in his room initially and later added another 7, then he has a total of 12 action figures now (5 + 7 = 12). So, Jerry has 12 action figures on his desk.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf in the room. Later, he added 6 more action figures to the collection. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had was initially 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, Jerry had 10 action figures on his shelf at the end of the passage.
Response:  Jerry had five action figures and nine books in his room initially. Later, he added seven more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf is: 5 + 7 = 12.
Response:  Jerry had two action figures and ten books in his room initially. Later, he added four more action figures to the collection. So, the total number of items Jerry had after adding the new action figures is: 2 + 4 = 6 action figures.  Therefore, Jerry had six action figures and ten books in his room.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books in his room initially. Later, he added 10 more books to the collection. So, the total number of books Jerry had was:  Initially: 8 + 9 = 17 Books Added later: 10 = 27 Books Total number of books: 17 + 27 = 44 Books
Response:  Jerry had seven action figures in his room and two books on the shelf. Later, he added four more books to the shelf. So, if we assume that each book takes up the same amount of space as one action figure (which is not necessarily true), then Jerry has three additional action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the total number of action figures Jerry has is 7 + 3 = 10.
Response:  Jerry had five action figures and two books in his room initially. Later, he added another nine books to the shelf. So, the total number of books Jerry had after adding more is 12 (5 + 2 + 9 = 12). Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures in his room on a shelf. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed 5 old ones. So, how many action figures did Jerry have on the shelf after these changes? We can use the information given in the question to find out.  First, let's count the number of action figures that Jerry added: 4. Then, let's subtract the number of action figures that he removed: 5. Therefore, the final number of action figures that Jerry had on the shelf is: 4 - 5 = -1. Jerry didn't have any action figures on the shelf after making these changes!
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures on his desk initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the desk and removed some old ones. If he now has 6 action figures on his desk, then he must have taken 3 from the initial number of 3 (since there are 6 - 3 = 3 new action figures). So, Jerry took 3 action figures from the initial number.
Response:  Jerry had seven action figures in the room initially. Later, he added more action figures to the pile and removed ten old ones. If he now has eight action figures on the pole, that means he must have added three new action figures after removing the ten old ones. So, the total number of action figures Jerry added is three.
Response:  Jerry had some action figures in his room that he later added two more to and removed seven old ones from. If he now has ten action figures on his desk, how many did he originally have? We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let X be the number of action figures Jerry had originally on his desk. Since he added two new action figures, we know that X + 2 = 10 (the total number of action figures he has now). To find out how many action figures Jerry had originally, we can subtract the number he added from the total number he has now: X + 2 - 2 = 10 So, Jerry had 8 action figures originally on his desk.
Response:  Jerry had 9 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the pile. So, the total number of action figures Jerry has is: 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, Jerry has 16 action figures on his desk.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf in the room. Later, he added another two action figures to the shelf. So, how many more action figures does Jerry have on the shelf now?  We can use the information given in the question to find out.  Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  Jerry had seven books and three action figures in his room initially. Later, he added two more action figures to the collection. So, if we subtract the initial number of action figures (3), we get the total number of additional books Jerry collected (4). Therefore, Jerry had four extra books besides the original seven.
Response:  If there were initially two birds sitting on the branch (Ptáci1 and Ptáci2), then when more birds joined them (Ptáci3, Ptáci4,..., Ptáci5), the total number of birds on the branch was 7 (2 + 3 + 4). So if we add another bird to the group (Ptáci6), the total number of birds on the branch will be 8 (7 + 1). Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  At first, there were 4 birds sitting on the fence (as stated in the problem). When another 4 birds came, the total number of birds on the fence became 8 (4 + 4 = 8). So initially, 4 birds sat on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 46 crows on the branch. If another 6 birds join them, then the total number of birds on the branch will be: 4 + 6 = 10 birds. So, there are 10 birds sitting on the branch in total.
Response:  We have three birds and two storks initially. If five more birds come, then we will have... (3 + 2) = 5 birds in total. So, there are 5 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We have three birds and four crows at first. If two more birds come, then we have:
3 + 2 = 5 birds in total.
So, there are five birds more than crows (4) on the fence."
Response:  We have 2 birds and 6 crows initially. If 3 more birds come to the field, there will be 5 birds in total (including the initial 2). However, we still have 6 crows, so the number of crows is greater than the number of birds. Therefore, the answer is 6 crows > 5 birds = 1 crow.
Response:  We have 4 penguins and 6 crows initially. If we add two more crows, then there are in total 4 + 2 = 6 crows. So, there is one stork.
"Response:  We know that initially there were three birds and four crows sitting on the branch. Then six more crows joined them. So, in total, we have:
3 + 4 = 7 birds
7 + 6 = 13 crows
Therefore, there are 13 birds and 13 crows sitting on the branch."
"Response:  We have six birds and three crows at first. If two more crows join them, then we have:
6 + 3 = 9 birds
So, there are nine birds more than crows on the fence."
Response:  We have four birds and three crows initially. Then six more crows join them, so now we have... (4 + 6) = 10 crows in total! Therefore, there are more crows than birds on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are six birds already sitting on the fence and then four more birds join them. So, in total, we have ten birds (6 + 4 = 10). Then, eight storks arrive, so now there are ten birds plus eight storks (10 + 8 = 18) sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final number of birds sitting on the fence is 18.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the branch initially. Then, five more birds join them, making it seven in total. Next, four crows arrive, bringing the total number of birds to eleven (7 + 4). So, there are eleven birds more than crows on the branch.
Response:  We have three birds and two more birds join them, so there are five birds in total. Then six crows arrive, which means we now have five birds plus six crows for a total of eleven animals on the branch. Since the original three birds outnumber the newcomers (two birds), there must be more crows than birds on the branch. Therefore, the correct answer is eleven crows.
"Response:  We have five crows and three sparrows initially. Then four more sparrows come. So, in total we have:
5 + 3 = 8 birds (including both crows and sparrows)
Now, let's compare this number with the number of crows on the branch: 5. Therefore, there are more sparrows than crows on the branch."
"Response:  We have six crows and two sparrows initially. Then three more sparrows come. So, in total we have:
6 + 3 = 9 birds (crows)
9 - 2 = 7 birds (sparrows)
Therefore, there are seven sparrows more than crows on the fence."
Response:  We have three birds sitting on the branch initially and then six crows join them plus two more birds come to sit with them. So in total we have 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the branch. Since there are already three birds sitting on the branch initially, that means there are 11 - 3 = 8 more birds than crows on the branch. Therefore, there are 8 more choughs (or ravens) than birds on the branch.
Response:  First chapter has 48 pages and second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in first chapter than in second chapter, we can divide the number of pages in first chapter by the number of pages in second chapter:  Number of pages in first chapter / Number of pages in second chapter = 48 / 11 = 4.36 (round to nearest whole number) So, there are 4 more pages in first chapter than in second chapter.
"Response:  First chapter has 37 pages, and second chapter has 80 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = 80 pages. Now, let's solve for ""Number of pages in second chapter"" using division: Number of pages in second chapter = 80 pages / 37 pages (first chapter) = 2.16 pages more than first chapter. Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  We know that there are 93 pages in total and the first chapter has 60 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and the second chapter has 36 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Now, we have been given that the total number of pages in the book is 67. Substituting this value into our equation, we get: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  First chapter has 66 pages, second chapter has 35 pages, and third chapter has 24 pages. So, total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the answer is 125 pages.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many pages each chapter has. From the information given in the question, we know that the first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the first chapter is 91, in the second chapter is 23, and in the third chapter is 25. Now, let's compare these numbers to see which one is larger. The largest number of pages among them is 91, so the first chapter has more pages than the other two chapters combined (91 > 23 + 25). Therefore, the answer to the question is:  First chapter has more pages than the other two chapters combined.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, so it takes us to page 35 + 1 = 36. Then we move to the second chapter with 18 pages, which brings us to page 36 + 18 = 54. Finally, we reach the third chapter with only 3 pages, which takes us to page 54 + 3 = 57. Therefore, the second chapter has 54 pages more than the third chapter.
Response:  First chapter has 53 pages, second chapter has 75 pages and third chapter has 21 pages. So total number of pages in first two chapters is 53 + 75 = 128 pages. Now we know that third chapter has fewer pages than first two chapters, so total number of pages in all three chapters is 128 + 21 = 149 pages. Therefore, first chapter has more than 30 pages more than third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, we can write: Number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, in this case, the number of pages would be: Number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 23 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters First chapter has 10 pages, so we can substitute this value into the above equation: Number of pages in first chapter = (Total number of pages) / (Number of chapters - 1) = (23 x 2) / 1 = 46 pages Now we have found out that there are 46 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter has x pages. Since the first chapter has 81 pages, we can write an equation:  x + y = 81 where y is the number of pages in the second chapter. Now we are given that the second chapter has 68 pages, so we can substitute this value into our equation:  x + 68 = 81 Solving for x, we get: x = 13 So there are 13 pages in the second chapter.
"Response:  We know that 62 táborníku were sent to sail in the morning and 39 of them went out to sail in the afternoon. So, we have:

Morning: 62 táborníku
Afternoon: 39 táborníku

Now let's find out how many more táborníku sailed in the morning than in the afternoon:

More táborníku who sailed in the morning = Total number of táborníku who sailed in the morning - Total number of táborníku who sailed in the afternoon
= 62 - 39
= 23

Therefore, there were 23 more táborníku who sailed in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  At dawn, 52 commanders went sailing.  In the afternoon, 61 commanders went sailing. So, there are more commanders who sailed in the afternoon than in the morning. Therefore, the difference between the number of commanders who sailed in the afternoon and those who sailed in the morning is 61 - 52 = 9.
"Response:  We know that in the morning, 15 táborníks went sailing and then some other táborníks went sailing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation:

Morning = 15 + x (where x is the number of táborníks who went sailing in the afternoon)

We also know that there were 32 táborníks in total. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

Total = Morning + Afternoon

Now, let's solve for ""Afternoon"":

Afternoon = Total - Morning

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Afternoon = 32 - 15
= 17

So, there were 17 táborníks who went sailing in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that some commanders rowed in the morning and seven commanders rowed in the afternoon. If they rowed altogether for 60 commanders that day, then we can write an equation as follows: Morning + Afternoon = Total. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Morning + (7 x Afternoon) = 60  Substituting the value of Afternoon from the question, we get: Morning + (7 x 5) = 60  Solving for Morning, we get: Morning = 20  Therefore, 20 commanders rowed in the morning and 40 commanders rowed in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, 36 generals were rowing together, in the afternoon, 13 generals were rowing together and in the evening, 49 generals were rowing together. So, the total number of generals who rowed together is: 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 generals.
"Response:  We know that 44 táborníku veslovalo ráno and 39 táborníku veslovalo odpoledne. So, we have:

44 - 39 = 5 more táborníku who veslovalo ráno than odpoledne.

Therefore, there were 5 more táborníku who veslovalo ráno than odpoledne."
Response:  We know that 53 táborníku veslovalo ráno and 48 táborníku veslovalo odpoledne. So, there are 53 - 48 = 5 more táborníku who veslovalo ráno than veslovalo odpoledne. Similarly, we know that 49 táborníku veslovalo večer. So, there are 49 - (53 + 48) = 10 more táborníku who veslovalo večer than veslovalo ráno or veslovalo odpoledne. Therefore, there were 10 more táborníku who loučili ráno víc než večer.
"Response:  We know that there are 33 táborníku who went for rowing in the morning and 34 táborníku who went for rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of táborníku who went for rowing during the day is:

33 + 34 = 67

Now, we know that only 10 táborníku went for rowing in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of táborníku who went for rowing in the afternoon and those who went for rowing in the evening is:

67 - 10 = 57

So, there were 57 táborníku who went for rowing during the daytime (morning and afternoon)."
Response:  We know that 13 táborníku went for a rowing trip and 59 táborníku went for a morning hike. So far, we have 72 táborníku (13 + 59). Then, 21 táborníku went for a rowing trip in the afternoon, so now we have 93 táborníku (72 + 21) who were together at some point during the day.
"Response:  We know that 29 táborníku went for rowing in the morning and 66 táborníku went for a walking trip in the morning. So, the total number of táborníku who went out in the morning is:

29 + 66 = 95

Now, we know that 26 táborníku went for rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of táborníku who went out in the afternoon is:

26

So, the difference between the number of táborníku who went out in the morning and those who went out in the afternoon is:

95 - 26 = 69

Therefore, more than 69 táborníku went for rowing in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that 41 táborníku went for a rowing trip in the morning and 4 táborníky went for a walking excursion. In the afternoon, 26 táborníku went for a rowing trip. So, we have to find out how many táborníky were there altogether.  To do this, we can use the information given in the question:  Total number of táborníky = Number of táborníky who went for a rowing trip in the morning + Number of táborníky who went for a walking excursion + Number of táborníky who went for a rowing trip in the afternoon.  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the formula:  Total number of táborníky = 41 + 4 + 26 = 71. Therefore, there were 71 táborníky in total.
Response:  We know that 46 táborníks were sent to sailing and we also know that 43 of them went for an early morning rowing session. So, the number of táborníks who did not go for an early morning rowing session is equal to the total number of táborníks minus the number of táborníks who went for an early morning rowing session. Therefore, the number of táborníks who went for an afternoon rowing session can be calculated as follows: Number of táborníks who went for an afternoon rowing session = Total number of táborníks - Number of táborníks who went for an early morning rowing session. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of táborníks who went for an afternoon rowing session = 46 - 43 = 3. Therefore, there were 3 táborníks who went for an afternoon rowing session.
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from her tree and then she had 7 apples on the tree, that means she left 3 apples on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples still on the tree.
Response:  We know that there were originally 4 apples in the tree and now there are only 2 left. So, if Rachel took some of the apples, she must have taken at least 2 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Rachel took is 2.
Response:  If Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree and now there are 5 apples left on the tree, then we can assume that 3 of them are still unripe (since they were not picked). So, the number of unripe apples on the tree is 5 - 3 = 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two ripe apples from her tree and now there are seven apples left on the tree. If six of them are ripe, then how many were not ripe initially? Well, if six out of seven are ripe, that means one is still unripe. So, initially, there was only one unripe apple on the tree. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree initially. Now she has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe ones. So, the number of apples on the tree at first was 6 - 2 = 4.
Response:  Rachel picked three ripe apples from her tree, so initially, she had 3 + 2 = 5 zripe apples. Now, she has 2 zripe apples and 27 unripe apples, so initially, there were 5 - 2 = 3 zripe apples. Therefore, the number of zripe apples the stom had at the beginning was 3.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 7 apples on her tree (sedm). Then, two new apples grew on the tree (dvacet nových jablek). Now, there are still six apples on the tree (šest jablek). So, to find out how many apples were on the tree at the beginning, we need to add up all these numbers: 7 + 2 = 9. Therefore, Rachel had 9 apples on her tree at the beginning.
Response:  We started with two apples in the tree and picked four of them. Then three new apples grew on the tree, so now we have seven apples in total (2 + 4 = 7). Therefore, there are seven apples on the tree now.
Response:  We know that Rachel had initially 52 jabloníks (jabłoni in Polish). Then she chose two jables from one of her trees. After that, there were still seven jableks left on the tree. So, we can conclude that at the beginning, Rachel's tree had 52 - 2 = 50 jableks.
Response:  Rachel took 8 apples from each of the three trees, so she got 8 x 3 = 24 apples in total. Now there are 9 apples on all the trees combined, which means that the number of apples on each tree is 9 / 3 = 3. So, Rachel has 3 apples on each of the three trees.
Response:  Rachel has 4 trees and she picks 7 apples from each tree. So, in total, she picks 4 x 7 = 28 apples. Now, there are 29 apples on the tree, so she must have picked one apple more than the total number of apples on all the trees. Therefore, the answer is 29 - 28 = 1.
Response:  We know that Ed had two more kicks than Doug and lost some kicks on the field. So, initially, Ed had 20 kicks more than Doug (2 = 18). Now, we are told that Ed has 19 kicks more than Doug after losing some kicks. Therefore, Doug must have lost 1 kick.  So, Doug lost 1 kick.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug because he lost fewer balls (10 vs 11). So, if Ed had 45 balls and lost 10, then he must have started with at least 35 balls (45 - 10 = 35). Now we need to find out how many more balls Ed had than Doug. If Ed had 35 balls and Doug had 25 balls (the number given in the question), then Ed had 10 more balls than Doug (35 - 25 = 10). Therefore, Ed had 10 more balls than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had six more kicks than Doug and lost seven kicks on the field. So, if Ed had 22 kickups, then he must have started with 15 (22 - 7 = 15). Therefore, Doug currently has 9 (15 - 6 = 9) kick-ups.
Response:  We know that Ed had five more kicks than Doug. So, if Ed had x kulíček, then Doug had x - 5 kulíček. Since Doug lost three kulíček on the field, he now has x - 3 kulíček. If Ed had 27 kulíček in total, then Doug must have had at least 24 kulíček (x - 3).
"Response:  We know that Ed had more than 24 bullets than Doug. So if Ed had x bullets and Doug had 24 bullets, then we can write an equation as follows:
x > 24
We also know that Doug lost 27 bullets on the field, so he has fewer bullets now. Let's write another equation based on this information:
Doug's current number of bullets = original number of bullets - (lost bullets)
Substituting the value of lost bullets from the previous equation into the second equation, we get:
Doug's current number of bullets = x - 27
Now we are given that Ed found 9 additional bullets. So let's add this to Doug's current number of bullets:
New total number of bullets for Ed = x + 9
Subtracting the new total number of bullets for Ed from his original number of bullets gives us the difference in bullets between Ed and Doug:
Diff = x - Doug's current number of bullets
Using the equations above, we can substitute values to solve for Diff:
Diff = x - (x - 27)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Diff = 27
Therefore, Ed had 27 more bullets than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug (Ed had 29 kuliček while Doug had 13). When Ed lost 17 of his kuliček on the field, he was left with how many kuliček? So, Ed had 29 - 17 = 12 more kuliček than Doug. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug (19 - 15 = 4). Then Ed lost some balls (he has fewer balls now). So we can say that Ed had 8 + 4 = 12 balls at first and then he lost some of them. Now he has 8 - 3 = 5 balls left. Therefore, Ed lost 3 balls.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug (Ed had 30 kuliček while Doug had 21). So, if Ed had 91 kuliček in total, then he must have started with at least 61 kuliček (91 - 30 = 61). Now we subtract the number of kuliček Ed lost during the game (21), and we get the difference between Ed's initial amount and his remaining amount: 61 - 21 = 40. Therefore, Ed had 40 more kuliček than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 12 marbles and lost some of them on the field. So, let's assume he had x marbles initially. Since Ed lost 20 marbles, his new number of marbles is x - 20. Now, we are told that Ed has 17 marbles left, so we can set up an equation: x - 20 = 17. Solving for x, we get: x = 37. Therefore, Doug has 37 marbles now.
"Response:  If 408 students suggested adding beetroot soup and 42 students suggested adding salted fish to the menu, then we can say that:

Number of students who suggested adding beetroot soup > Number of students who suggested adding salted fish (by 408 - 42 = 366)

So, there are more than 366 students who suggested adding beetroot soup to the menu compared to those who suggested adding salted fish."
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding beetroot soup to the menu and 489 students suggested adding salted fish, then we can say that the number of students who suggested adding salted fish is greater than the number of students who suggested adding beetroot soup. So, the answer is (489 - 479) = 9.
"Response:  We know that out of 310 students who were asked to suggest specific dishes for the school cafeteria, 185 suggested adding mashed potatoes (bramborová kaše in Czech). So, the number of students who did not suggest mashed potatoes is:

Number of students who did not suggest mashed potatoes = Total number of students - Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes
= 310 - 185
= 125

Now, we are told that some students also suggested adding salted meat to the menu. The question asks how many students suggested this option. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of students who suggested adding salted meat is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes.

So, the answer to the question ""Kolik studentů navrhlo slaninu?"" is:

Number of students who suggested adding salted meat = Total number of students - Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes
= 310 - 125
= 185

Therefore, 185 students suggested adding salted meat to the menu."
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding salt to their meal plan. This means that 264/288 = 0.91 or approximately 91% of students wanted to add salt to their meal plan.  As for the second part of the question, we are told that some students suggested adding mashed potatoes to their meal plan. However, we are not given any specific number of students who made this suggestion. Therefore, we cannot determine how many students actually suggested adding mashed potatoes to their meal plan based on the information provided in the question.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 63 students suggested adding saltine crackers more than those who suggested mashed potatoes, then we can say that 63 - 457 = x number of students suggested adding saltines. So, x = 294.
Response:  We know that out of 182 students who responded, 166 students wanted to add salt to their meals more than those who wanted to add mashed potatoes. So, we can say that 166/182 = x, where x is the number of students who wanted to add salt. Since there are 100% students in total (i.e., 182), we can write the equation as follows: 100 = x + 166. Solving for x, we get: x = 136. Therefore, 136 students wanted to add salt to their meals more than those who wanted to add mashed potatoes.
Response:  If 324 students suggested adding Bramble Kaish, and 374 students suggested adding Saltine, then there are total of 698 suggestions for new food items (324 + 374). And if 128 students suggested adding Rajchat, then there are total of 726 suggestions for new food items (698 + 128). So, the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items is 726.
Response:  If 257 students suggested adding potato dumplings and 120 students suggested adding pickles, then there are more students who suggested adding potato dumplings than those who suggested adding pickles. So, the number of students who suggested adding potato dumplings is greater than 120.  Similarly, if 97 students suggested adding tomatoes and 120 students suggested adding pickles, then there are more students who suggested adding tomatoes than those who suggested adding pickles. So, the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes is greater than 97. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding brambo
Response:  If 144 students suggested adding potato soup and 467 students suggested adding salted fish, then there are more students who suggested adding potato soup than those who suggested adding salted fish (144 > 467). Similarly, if 79 students suggested adding tomatoes and 467 students suggested adding salted fish, then there are more students who suggested adding tomatoes than those who suggested adding salted fish (79 > 467). So, the number of students who suggested adding bramborouska is greater than the number of students who suggested adding salty fish or tomatoes.
Response:  If 337 students suggested adding salted meat and only 23 students suggested adding tomatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding salted meat than those who suggested adding tomatoes. So, we can say that the number of students who suggested adding salted meat is greater than the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes.
Response:  If 450 students suggested adding beetroot soup and 38 students suggested adding salted fish to the menu, then we have a total of 488 suggestions (450 + 38). This means that 92% of the students participated in suggesting new dishes (488/500 x 100%).
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding Brussels sprouts and only 351 suggested adding saltine crackers, then we can say that 218 + 351 = 569 students made suggestions for the menu. So, the number of students who suggested adding saltine crackers is 569 - 351 = 218.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding saltiness to the menu and 330 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, then there are more students who suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding saltiness. So, A is the correct answer.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 841 - 34  Number of boys = 796 Therefore, there are 796 boys at the school who are more than the 34 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 697 girls and 228 boys, then the number of boys is less than half of the total number of students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of boys = x/2 Where 'x' represents the total number of students (i.e., 697 + 228). Now, we need to solve for 'x', which means finding out how many boys are in the school. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Number of boys = x / 2 x = 2(697 + 228) = 1025 Solution: There are 1025 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 boys in total. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls = 635 - 510 = 125 boys. Therefore, there are 125 boys in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 868 girls and 281 boys, then the number of students (including both genders) is:

868 + 281 = 1149

Therefore, there are 1149 students in total at this school."
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are 700 girls and 142 boys, then the total number of students is 700 + 142 = 842. Therefore, there are 842 students in this school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. Then, 418 more girls joined the school. So, the total number of girls is now: 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of boys as follows: 222 + (number of new boys) =...
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, another 44 girls joined the school. So, now we need to find out how many girls are currently in the school. To do this, we can use the following calculation: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly added girls In our case, the initial number of girls is 902, and the newly added girls are 44. Therefore, the total number of girls in the school is: Number of girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 girls Now, let's find out how many boys are left in the school: Number of boys = Original number of boys - Number of new girls who joined the school = 410 - 465 = -255 boys That means there are more girls than boys in the school!
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls is now: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Similarly, we can calculate the number of boys as follows: Initially, there were 761 boys, and then 8 more boys joined the school, so the total number of boys is: 761 + 8 = 769 boys. Therefore, there are 1414 girls and 769 boys in the school currently.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in the school and 135 girls. So, the total number of students was 214 + 135 = 349. Now, we are told that 496 girls joined the school, so the new total number of girls is 496 + 135 = 631. And we also know that 910 boys joined the school, so the new total number of boys is 214 + 910 = 1124. Therefore, there are currently 1124 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, if we add these numbers together, we get 626 students in total (308 + 318). However, we also know that there are 36 teachers at the school. If we divide the number of students by the number of teachers, we get an average of 17.5 students per teacher (626 / 36 = 17.5). Therefore, there are approximately 17.5 students in each classroom.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 624:772 = 1:1. So, there is one student for every teacher in the school.
Response:  If there are 402 girls in the school and 739 students altogether, then the number of boys is equal to 739 - 402 = 337.
"Response:  If there are 458 girls in the school and 692 students total, then the number of boys is:

Boys = Total students - Girls
= 692 - 458
= 234

Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. Then, another 403 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of boys = 362 + 403 = 765 Number of girls = 257 + 403 = 659 Therefore, there are more girls than boys at the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16, so he has $2 left ($18 - $16 = $2).
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, he must have spent $10 ($13 - $3 = $10).
Response:  Edward had $9 initially and then he spent another $8. So, his new balance is $17. To find out how much he had before spending any money, we need to subtract the amount he spent from his initial balance: $17 - $8 = $9. Therefore, Edward had $9 initially.
Response:  If Edward had $16 and spent it all on books that cost him $9 each, then he would have spent a total of $16 / 9 = 170 dollars on books. Since he now has $6 left, we can deduce that he must have started with at least $6 + 170 = 176 dollars. So, Edward had $176 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 on two books and now has $12 in total. So, each book cost him half of the remaining amount after buying both books: $\$6 / \$6 = \$1$. Therefore, each book cost $\$1$.
Response:  Edward had $6 for books and $16 for hair cuts, so he had a total of $22 ($6 + $16). Then, after spending money, he has $19 left. So, Edward had $3 more than $19 before he spent his money ($19 + $3 = $22).
Response:  Edward spent $4 for books and $3 for a hat, so he spent a total of $7 (4 + 3). Now he has $12 - $7 = $5 left. Therefore, Edward spent $5 on books and hats.
Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on hair. Now he has $19. To find out how much he spent on books more than on hair, we can subtract the amount he spent on hair from the total amount he had: $19 - $8 = $11. So, Edward spent $11 more on books than on hair.
Response:  Edward had $17 initially and then he spent some of it. So, let's say he spent half of his initial amount which is $8.5 (since he has $7 left). Now, his friend gave him $10, so now Edward has $17 + $10 = $27.
Response:  Zachary made 44 clicks in class gym and David made more than Zachary. So, David made at least 44 + 1 = 45 clicks. Therefore, Zachary and David together made 45 + 44 = 89 clicks in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 clicks and David made 44 clicks. To find out how many more clicks Zachary made than David, we can subtract their number of clicks from each other:  51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary made 7 more clicks than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 clicks in class gym.  And we also know that Zachary made fewer clicks than David. So, if Zachary made x clicks, then we can write an equation as follows:  David made 44 clicks and Zachary made x clicks.  Therefore, we have:  x = 44 - 9.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 35.  So, Zachary made 35 clicks in class gym.
Response:  We know that David made 51 clicks in class and Zachary made fewer than him. So, we can say that Zachary made x clicks less than David. Now, we are told that David made 49 more clicks than Zachary. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 51 - x = 49. Solving for x, we get: x = 20. So, Zachary made 20 clicks less than David in class.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 clicks and 44 crunches at the gym.  David did more than Zachary in terms of number of clicks (he did 19 more), but he didn't do as many crunches (he did 27 fewer). So, if we subtract the number of crunches David did from the total number of clicks Zachary did, we get the number of click David did. Therefore, David did 59 - 44 = 15 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 clicks and 17 double clicks at the gym. So he made a total of 61 clicks (44 + 17). Now we are told that David made 29 more clicks than Zachary, but he also made 13 shorter presses than Zachary. This means that David made a total of 42 clicks (29 + 13). Therefore, David pressed the button 42 times less than Zachary.
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 53 clicks and 14 dribbles at the gym.  David did 17 more clicks than Zachary, but he did 10 fewer dribbles. So if David did x clicks and y dribbles, we can write an equation as follows:

x + 17 = 53 (Zachary's clicks)
x - 10 = 14 (Zachary's dribbles)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 36
y = 24

So Zachary did 36 clicks and 24 dribbles at the gym."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 clicks and 3 stretches at the gym.  David did 58 more clicks than Zachary, but he did 87 fewer clicks than Zachary. So if Zachary did x clicks, then David did x + 58 clicks. Since David did more clicks than Zachary, we can say that Zachary did less than half of what David did. Therefore, Zachary did (x/2) clicks. Now let's find out how many push-ups and crunches Zachary did. According to the question, David did 87 fewer push-ups than Zachary. If Zachary did x clicks, then David did x + 87 clicks. Since David did more push-ups than Zachary, we can say that Zachary did less than half of what David did. Therefore, Zachary did (x/2) push-ups. Similarly, since David did more crunches than Zachary, we can say that Zachary did less than half of what David did. Therefore, Zachary did (x/2) crunches. Based on this information, we can conclude that Zachary did 17 push-ups and 14 crunches at the gym.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 46 clicks and 58 push-ups at the gym. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary but had 62 fewer push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary performed x push-ups before doing any push-ups, then David performed (x + 38) push-ups after Zachary finished his last push-up. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x - 62 = (x + 38) - 58  Simplifying the above equation, we get:  x = 10  So Zachary performed 10 push-ups before starting to do push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did more than Zachary because he got 39 clicks and Zachary only got 19 clicks. So, if we subtract the number of clicks Zachary got from the number of clicks David got, we will get the difference between their numbers. Therefore, David did 20 more clickups (39 - 19 = 20). Now, let's check whether this answer is correct based on the information given in the question. According to the question, John did 13 fewer clickups than David. This means that if David did x clickups, then John did x - 13 clickups. Since David did 20 more clickups than Zachary, Zachary did x - 20 clickups. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: David did 20 + (x - 20) = 39 clickups. Simplifying the equation, we get: David did 59 clickups. So, our answer is 59.
"Response:  We know that David did 22 more clicks than Zachary and John did 4 fewer clicks than David. So if we write it down like this:
David - 51 = 73 (more clicks)
Zachary - 51 = 20 (fewer clicks)
John - 73 = 93 (less clicks)
Now we have to find out how many push-ups John did. To do this, we subtract the number of clicks he did from the total number of clicks in the classroom:
John - 93 = 51 (clicks done by John)
So John did 51 push-ups."
"Response:  We know that David made 39 more clicks than Zachary and John did 9 fewer clicks than David. So we can write an equation: 
David - John = 39 + 9 = 48  Now let's solve for Zachary's number of clicks:  Zachary = David - (John - 9) = 48 - (39 + 9) = 30  Therefore, Zachary clicked 30 times in gym class."
Response:  We know that David made 30 more clicks than Zachary in class gym today. So if David made 37 clicks, then Zachary must have made 37 - 30 = 7 clicks.
Response:  If David made 56 more clicks than Zachary at the gym and David made 38 clicks, then Zachary made 18 clicks (56 - 38 = 18). So, together they made 76 clicks (David + Zachary)
Response:  We know that David made 40 more clicks than Zachary and also made shorter presses on the exercise bike. So if Zachary made x stikes, then David made (x + 40) stikes. Now we are given that when Zachary made 34 clicks and 62 short presses, David made 62 - 40 = 22 stikes. Therefore, David made 22 stikes on the exercise bike.
"Response:  We know that David made 36 more clicks than Zachary and also made 33 shorter presses on the exercise bike. So, if David made x clicks, then Zachary made x - 33 clicks. Now we are told that when Zachary made 58 clicks, he also made 33 creaks. Therefore, the difference between the number of clicks David made and the number of creaks Zachary made is:

David made x clicks, and Zachary made x - 33 clicks = 2x - 33 clicks.
So, David made 2x - 33 clicks more than Zachary."
"Response:  David made 27 more clicks than Zachary on the exercise machine. So if Zachary made x clicks, David made x + 27 clicks. We know that David made 7 fewer clicks than Zachary. Therefore, we can write an equation:
x + 27 = (x - 7)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 34
So Zachary made 34 clicks and David made 61 clicks (34 + 27)."
"Response:  Rachel had to complete 5 tasks from mathematics and 2 pages of tasks from reading. How many more pages of homework did she have in mathematics than in reading?  We can write this as an equation:

Mathematics = 5 + x
Reading = 2

Where x is the number of extra pages of homework in mathematics.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 5 - 2 = 3
So, Rachel had 3 more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 3 pages of math tasks and 4 pages of reading tasks. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Math tasks = 3
Reading tasks = 4
Now, let's find out how many more pages of reading tasks Rachel had to complete than math tasks:
More pages of reading tasks = Reading tasks - Math tasks
= 4 - 3
= 1
So, Rachel had 1 more page of reading tasks than math tasks."
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math tasks and additional 2 pages of reading comprehension tasks, then she had to complete a total of 7 pages of homework. So, if she completed 3 pages of reading comprehension tasks, she had to complete 4 pages (7 - 3 = 4) more pages of reading comprehension tasks.
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 7 tasks from mathematics and she had to complete more than 4 tasks from reading. So, let's assume that she completed x tasks from reading. Now we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Total number of tasks = Number of tasks from mathematics + Number of tasks from reading  Total number of tasks = 7 + x  Substituting the value of x (which is the number of tasks Rachel completed from reading), we get: Total number of tasks = 7 + x  Solving for x, we get: x = 3  Therefore, Rachel had to complete 3 tasks from reading.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 tasks from mathematics and she did more than 3 homework tasks from mathematics than reading, then we can say that she completed at least 5 homework tasks from mathematics. So, Rachel had to complete 5 + 3 = 8 pages of homework.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 math tasks and needed to complete 6 additional homework tasks beyond mathematics, then she had to complete 6 + 8 = 14 homework tasks in total.
Response:  If Rachel completed 10 tasks from mathematics and she had to complete 3 additional homework tasks, then the total number of pages she had to complete is:  Total = 10 + 3 = 13 pages. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 13 pages in total.
"Response: 
Rachel has to complete 2 pages of math tasks (2/1 = 2), 3 pages of reading comprehension tasks (3/1 = 3), and additional 10 pages of biology tasks (10/1 = 10). Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to complete 17 pages (2 + 3 + 10) of work."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete nine tasks from mathematics and two tasks from reading. Additionally, she has to complete 96 tasks from biology. So, in total, Rachel has to complete 101 tasks (9 + 2 = 101). Therefore, the number of extra pages for domestic math tasks is 101 - 2 = 99 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension.  We also know that she had to complete additional 3 pages of biology homework. So in total, Rachel had to complete 11 + 2 = 13 pages of homework. Now we need to find out how many pages of math homework Rachel had to complete compared to biology homework. To do this, we divide the number of pages of math homework (13) by the number of pages of biology homework (3). This gives us a ratio of 13/3 = 4. Therefore, Rachel had to complete more than 4 times as much math homework as biology homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 7 tasks from mathematics, 11 tasks from reading and 8 tasks from biology. To find out how many pages she has more than in biology, we need to subtract the number of pages from biology from the total number of pages. So, let's calculate it: Total number of pages = 7 + 11 + 8 = 26 pages. Now, we can see that Rachel has 26 - 8 = 18 pages more than in biology. Therefore, the answer is 18 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 9 tasks from mathematics and 11 tasks from reading. So, in total she needs to complete 9 + 11 = 20 tasks. Now we are asked how many pages of tasks Rachel had to complete. Based on the information given, there are 29 pages of tasks from biology. Therefore, the number of pages of tasks Rachel had to complete is 29 - 20 = 9 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math tasks and 7 pages of reading comprehension tasks. Therefore, she needed to complete 8 + 7 = 15 pages of tasks in total. Additionally, we are told that she completed 3 pages of biology tasks, so she needed to complete 15 - 3 = 12 pages of tasks in total from math and biology.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 tasks from mathematics and 10 tasks from reading. Each task in mathematics requires 2 pages, so she needs to finish 5 x 2 = 10 pages of mathematics. Similarly, each task in reading requires 3 pages, so she needs to finish 10 x 3 = 30 pages of reading. Now we need to find out how many pages she has to complete from biology. The question states that she has to complete 6 tasks from biology, and each task requires 4 pages. So she needs to finish 6 x 4 = 24 pages of biology. Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to complete 10 + 30 + 24 = 64 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 2 pages of homework from reading and 4 pages of homework from mathematics. So, in total she has to complete 6 pages of homework (2 + 4). Now we need to find out how many more pages of homework Rachel had to complete from mathematics than from reading. To do this, we subtract the number of pages from reading from the total number of pages: 6 - 2 = 4 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 4 more pages of homework from mathematics than from reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of homework from reading and 19 pages of homework from other subjects. So, she had to complete a total of 23 pages of homework. Now, we are asked how many pages of homework from math did Rachel have more than from reading. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pages from reading (4) from the total number of pages of homework (23). Therefore, Rachel had 19 pages of homework from math more than from reading.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, he received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon. The difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is 4 (6 - 2). Therefore, Jack received 4 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  At morning, Jack sent 6 emails and at noon he received 2 more emails. So in total, Jack sent 6 + 2 = 8 emails in the morning. In the afternoon, Jack did not send any email because it was already mentioned that he received 8 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning. The difference between the number of emails Jack sent in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is equal to the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon minus the number of emails Jack sent in the morning.  Subtracting 8 from 8 gives us 0, which means Jack did not receive any additional emails in the afternoon compared to the morning. So, the answer is 0.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 1 email in the afternoon (a total of 5 emails), then he received 3 emails in the afternoon (since there are 24 hours in a day). So, Jack received 3 emails after noon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of:  6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails for the day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 13 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon).  In addition to this, he received 72 emails in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received is:  13 + 72 = 85 emails.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now we are asked how many emails Jack received in the evening. Since he did not receive any emails at night, the answer is 0. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails during the daytime and 0 emails in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails early in the morning (so that means he received them between midnight and 6 AM). Then, he received 4 emails after lunchtime (between noon and 6 PM), which is another 4 hours. Finally, he received 8 emails in the evening (between 6 PM and midnight), which is an additional 8 hours. Therefore, Jack received a total of 15 emails during the day (3 + 4 + 8 = 15).
"Response:  We know that Jack sent 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write down:
Morning: 10 emails = 10 x (morning hours)
Afternoon: 7 emails = 7 x (afternoon hours)
We don't know how many hours Jack spent sending emails in the evening, but we know he sent 17 emails during this time period. Therefore, we can write down:
Evening: 17 emails = 17 x (evening hours)
Now, let's find out how many hours Jack spent sending emails in each time period:
Morning: 8 hours (since it was 8 am when he sent the first email)
Afternoon: 5 hours (since it was 1 pm when he sent the last email)
Evening: 6 hours (since it was 6 pm when he sent the last email)
So, now we can calculate the number of emails Jack received in each time period:
Morning: 10 emails / 8 hours = 1.25 emails/hour
Afternoon: 7 emails / 5 hours = 1.4 emails/hour
Evening: 17 emails / 6 hours = 2.83 emails/hour
Finally, to determine which time period had more emails, we need to divide the total number of emails Jack received by the number of hours he spent sending them in each time period:
Total emails: 10 + 7 + 17 = 34 emails
Morning hours: 1.25 emails/hour x 8 hours = 10 emails
Afternoon hours: 1.4 emails/hour x 5 hours = 7 emails
Evening hours: 2.83 emails/hour x 6 hours = 16 emails
Therefore, Jack received more emails in the evening than in either the morning or afternoon. The correct answer is: Evening - More emails were received in the evening."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, we can write down the information as follows:
Morning: 9 emails
Evening: 7 emails
Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received in the morning to the number he received in the evening:
Morning: 9 emails
Evening: 7 emails
We can see that Jack received more emails in the morning than in the evening, so the answer is:
More emails in the morning."
Response:  We know that Jack sent 5 emails in the afternoon and 4 emails in the evening. So, he received more emails in the evening than in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is less than or equal to 5. Now we can calculate the difference between the total number of emails Jack received (10) and the number of emails he received in the afternoon (less than or equal to 5): 10 - 5 = 5. So, Jack received 5 more emails in the evening than he sent in the morning.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the day. Therefore, he must have received 2 emails in the evening (since there are still ""pár"" left). So, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 2 in the evening, for a total of 5 emails received that day."
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 5 emails and 54 letters. So, altogether, Jack received 3 + 5 = 8 emails and 64 + 54 = 118 letters during the day. Therefore, Jack received 8 emails for the entire day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he got a total of 11 messages (5 + 6 = 11). In the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters, so his total number of messages for the day is now 18 (11 + 9 + 7 = 18). Therefore, Jack received 18 messages during the day.
Response:  Ráno Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. In total, he received 22 messages (10 + 12 = 22).  In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So in total, he received 56 messages (3 + 44 = 56). Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning by 34 messages (56 - 22 = 34).
Response:  At 6 am, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters.  At noon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters. So in total, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 emails before noon. And at noon, he received 2 more emails. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received between 6 am and noon is 14 + 2 = 16 emails.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters during the morning. So he sent 91 - 6 = 85 letters in total during the morning. Then we are told that he received 2 emails after lunch and sent 74 letters afterwards. Therefore, he sent 74 + 2 = 76 letters in total after lunch. Finally, we are asked how many emails Jack received during the day. Since he received 2 emails after lunch, he must have received a total of 2 + 6 = 8 emails during the day.  Therefore, Jack received 8 emails during the day.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 emails in the morning, so he received + sent = 6 emails in total. Then, he received 6 more emails in the afternoon and sent 8 emails. So, the total number of emails Jack sent is 8. Therefore, the answer to the question is 8.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and then additional 2 emails in the afternoon, he received a total of 7 + 2 = 9 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails in total that day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails yesterday afternoon and 5 emails this morning. So, he received a total of 8 emails today (3 + 5 = 8). Now, we are asked how many emails Jack received more in the evening than he did in the morning. To find out, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the evening:  Number of emails received in the evening - Number of emails received in the morning = 16 - 8 = 8 Therefore, Jack received 8 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 9 emails during the day. Therefore, he received 9 - 3 = 6 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Kobylka skočila o 9 palců and Žába skočila o 12 palců. So we can write this as :  Distance = 9 + 12 = 21 palců. Therefore, the distance traveled by Žába is 21 palců more than the distance traveled by Kobylka.
Response:  Kobylka skočila o 31 palců and Žába skočila o 35 palců. So together they have jumped 31 + 35 = 66 palců.
Response:  We know that: * Kobylka skočila o 36 palců (or inches). * Žába skočila o 17 palců dál než kobylka. So, the distance traveled by the frog is 17 + 36 = 53 palců (or inches) away from where the tortoise started. * Myš skočila o 15 palců dál než žába. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 15 + 53 = 68 palců (or inches) away from where the tortoise started. Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog is 68 palců (or inches) away from where the tortoise started.
Response:  We know that: * Kobylka skočila o 25 palců (or 63 cm) * Žába skočila o 18 palců dál než kobylka (or 45 cm) * Myš skočila o 2 palce dál než žába (or 5 cm) From these statements, we can conclude that: * The distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the distance traveled by the frog minus the distance traveled by the snake. * The distance traveled by the frog is equal to the distance traveled by the snake plus the distance traveled by the mouse. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: * Distance traveled by the mouse = 5 cm * Distance traveled by the frog = 45 cm - 25 cm = 20 cm * Distance traveled by the snake = 63 cm - 20 cm = 43 cm Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is 5 cm.
Response:  We know that: * Kobylka skočila o 30 cm. * Žába skočila o 10 palců (which is equal to 40 cm). * Myš skočila o 20 palců (which is equal to 80 cm). Now we can calculate how far away from each other are these three animals: * From kobylka to myš: distance = 80 cm - 30 cm = 50 cm * From myš to žába: distance = 40 cm + 40 cm = 80 cm So, myš was 50 cm away from kobylka and 80 cm away from žába.
"Response:  We know that:
Kobylka skočila o 30 centimetre (cm).
Žába skočila o 39 palců (palce = 1/3 of an inch).
Myš skočila o 94 palců méně než žába.
From the information given above we can write two equations:
Equation 1: Kobylka + Žába = Myš...(1)
Equation 2: Distance traveled by Žába = Distance traveled by Kobylka + Distance traveled by Myš - Distance traveled by Žába...(2)
Now let's solve for distance traveled by Žába using equation (2):
Distance traveled by Žába = Distance traveled by Kobylka + Distance traveled by Myš - Distance traveled by Žába
= 30 cm + x cm - 94 cm
where x is the distance traveled by Žába.
Substituting the values from equation (1), we get:
x = 39 palců
Therefore, the distance traveled by Žába is 39 inches or 99 cm."
"Response:  We know that Kobylka (frog) jumped 25 cm, Žába (toad) jumped 32 cm further than Kobylka, and Myš (mouse) jumped 26 cm less than Žába. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Myš = Žába - 26

Now, we need to solve for Myš. Substituting the values given in the question into the equation above, we get:

Myš = 32 - 26
Myš = 7

So, the mouse jumped 7 cm."
"Response:  We know that:
Kobylka skočila o 24 palců.
Žába skočila o 33 palců dál než kobylka.
Myš skočila o 5 palců méně než žába.
From this information, we can write an equation:
Distance = Kobylka + (Žába - Kobylka)
= 24 + (33 - 24)
= 57
So, myš skočila o 57 palců dál než kobylka."
Response:  We know that Kobylka skočila o 13 palců (or inches). Then, we are told that Kobylka skočila o dva palce dál než Kobylka. This means that she skočila o 2 more inches than Kobylka. So, if Kobylka skočila o 13 palců, then Kobylka skočila o 15 palců (or inches). Now, we are also told that Žába skočila daleko než Kobylka. This means that Žába skočila further away from the starting point than Kobylka did. Therefore, the distance traveled by Žába is equal to the distance traveled by Kobylka plus the additional distance traveled by Žába beyond Kobylka. Using the values given in the question, we can calculate this as follows: Distance = 15 inches + (distance traveled by Kobylka) = 15 inches + 13 inches = 28 inches. Therefore, the distance traveled by Žába is 28 inches.
Response:  Kobylka skočila o 35 palců (or 35 cm). Then, Kobylka skočila o 10 centimetres more than Kobylka. So, she skočila o 45 cm in total. Now we need to find out how much they both skočilo together. To do this, we can simply add their individual distances: 35 + 45 = 80 cm. Therefore, they both skočilo a total of 80 cm.
Response:  We know that: * The distance traveled by the frog is 30 cm. * The distance traveled by the tadpole is 20 cm (since it is 10 cm less than the frog). * The distance traveled by the mouse is 15 cm (less than the frog and tadpole). Now we can calculate the distance traveled by each creature as follows: Frog: Distance = 30 cm Tadpole: Distance = 20 cm Mouse: Distance = 15 cm From the information provided in the question, we can conclude that the distance traveled by the frog is greater than the sum of the distances traveled by the tadpole and the mouse. Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog must be equal to or greater than 45 cm (i.e., 30 + 20 + 15 = 45). So, the distance traveled by the frog is 45 cm.
Response:  We know that: * The distance traveled by the frog is 39 palms (or 39 cm). * The distance traveled by the tadpole is 30 cm more than the distance traveled by the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the tadpole is: 39 cm + (30 cm x 2) = 79 cm. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 79 cm - 30 cm = 49 cm.
Response:  We know that: *Kobylka skočila o 21 palců. *Kobylka skočila o 25 palců dál než žába. *Myš skočila o 16 palců méně než žába. From these statements, we can conclude that: *The distance between Kobylka and Myš is 21 + 16 = 37 palců. So, Kobylka skočila o 37 palců more than Myš.
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog is 39 palms and the distance traveled by the turtle is 17 palms. So we can write an equation as follows: Distance = Frog + Turtle (Distance) = 39 + 17 = 56 palms Now we have to find out how far away from the starting point the turtle was when it reached the finish line. To do this, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the turtle from the total distance traveled by both animals together. Therefore, the distance between the start and the end of the race for the turtle would be: Distance = Total distance - Turtle distance = 56 - 17 = 39 palms So the turtle traveled 39 palms beyond its starting point before reaching the finish line.
Response:  We know that: * Kobylka skočila o 15 cm. * Myš skočila o 10 cm less than Kobylka (since she skočila o 15 - 10 = 5 cm more than Kobylka). So, the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the distance traveled by Kobylka plus the difference in their jumps: Distance = Distance traveled by Kobylka + (Distance traveled by Kobylka - Distance traveled by Myš) = 15 cm + (15 - 5) = 20 cm Therefore, the mouse traveled 20 cm.
"Response:  We know that:
Kobylka skočila o 14 palců.
Myš skočila o 16 palců méně než žába (so 14 palců).
Žába skočila o 37 palců dál než kobylka.
So we can write an equation based on these statements:
Distance traveled by Kobylka = 14 palců
Distance traveled by Myš = 16 palců - 14 palců = 2 palců
Distance traveled by Žába = 37 palců - 14 palců = 23 palců
Now we need to find out how far away from each other were Kobylka and Myš at the end of their jumps. To do this, we will use the distance formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed is constant for all three animals (since they are jumping at the same time), so we can set it equal to 1 palcu per second (which is a reasonable value for small animals like these):
Speed = 1 palcu/sec
Now we have all the information we need to solve the problem:
Distance between Kobylka and Myš = Speed x Time
= 1 palcu/sec x (2 sec + 0 sec)
= 2 palců
Distance between Kobylka and Žába = Speed x Time
= 1 palcu/sec x (3 sec + 14 sec)
= 23 palců
Therefore, the answer to the question is: Myš skočila o 2 palců méně než Kobylka, a o 23 palců dál než Kobylka."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and needs to add more to make 14 cups in total.  To find out how many cups she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has from the total amount needed (14 - 5 = 9). So, Mary needs to add 9 additional cups of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. If she has already added 4 cups of flour, then we need to find out how many cups of sugar are needed to make up for the missing flour. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (11 cups) by the amount of flour already used (4 cups). This gives us an estimate of how much more sugar is needed: 11 / 4 = 2.75 cups. So, we need to add approximately 2.75 cups of sugar to the mixture to compensate for the missing flour.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to make the dough and now she needs 8 more shakes of flour than sugar. So we can write an equation as follows:

Mary has x shakes of flour + 13 shakes of sugar =?
We also know that Mary started with 6 shakes of flour, so we can subtract this from her total amount of flour:
x - 6 = 8
Now we need to solve for x, which means dividing both sides of the equation by 2 (since there are two shakes of flour in each shake of sugar):
x / 2 = 8 / 2
x = 4
So Mary needs 4 additional shakes of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar for her recipe. She has already added some flour, but we don't know how much. To find out if she still needs more flour or not, we need to compare the amount of flour she has with the total amount needed. So, let's calculate it:

Total amount of flour needed = 11 cups
Amount of flour Mary has given so far =? (we don't know)

We can start by assuming that Mary has given half of the total amount of flour needed, which is 5.5 cups (half of 11). Now, let's see if she still needs more flour or not:

Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour Mary has given = 11 - 5.5 = 5.5 cups

Since Mary has given less than the total amount of flour needed, she still needs more flour. In fact, she needs an additional 5.5 cups of flour. Therefore, the answer is 5.5 cups."
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and some additional cups of flour.  If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, then she still needs to add 8 more cups (11 - 3 = 8). So, the recipe requires 8 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary needs 12 cups of flour and she has already given some. So let's assume she gave x cups of flour. Now we need to find out how many more cups she needs. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups she gave from the total amount needed: 12 - x = 6. Therefore, Mary still needs 6 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that we need to add 4 shakes of flour (since there are 9 shakes in total). So if we have already added 3 shakes, then we still need to add 1 more shake = 4 - 3 = 1 shake. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more shake of flour.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 shakes of sugar and we have already added 2 shakes. So, to find out how many more shakes are needed, we need to subtract the number of shakes we have already added from the total amount required:

14 - 2 = 12

So, Mary still needs 12 shakes of sugar."
Response:  We know that we need to add 7 more spoons of flour (since there are already 11 spoons added). So, if we have 12 spoons needed in total, and we have already added 11, then we need to add 7 more. Therefore, the number of spoons of flour still needed is 7.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 10 cups of flour and we have already added 7 cups (since Mary has given us 7 cups). So, to find out how many more cups of flour are needed, we need to subtract the number of cups we have from the total amount required:

10 - 7 = 3
So, we need 3 additional cups of flour."
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 12 cups of flour for her recipe and she has already added 2 cups. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount needed:

12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups

So, Mary needs 10 additional cups of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 6 cups of flour for her recipe and she has already added 5 cups. So, we need to find out how much more c sugar than salt is needed.  To do this, we can use the following formula:

C Sugar = (Total amount of sugar required - Amount of sugar already added) / Total amount of flour required

In our case, the total amount of sugar required is 8 cups (since there are 8 cups of sugar in the original recipe), and the amount of sugar already added is 5 cups (since Mary has already added 5 cups). Therefore, we can calculate the number of additional cups of sugar as follows:

Additional Cups of Sugar = 8 - 5 = 3

So, Mary needs 3 extra cups of sugar beyond what she has already added. Since each cup of sugar is equal to 40 grams, we can convert this quantity into grams as follows:

Grams of Sugar = 3 x 40 = 120 grams

Therefore, Mary needs an additional 120 grams of sugar beyond what she has already added."
Response:  We know that Mary needs 13 spoons of sugar for her recipe and she has already given 2 spoons. So, we need to find out how many spoons of sugar are left needed. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (13) by the amount of sugar Mary has given (2). This gives us the number of spoons of sugar still needed: 13 / 2 = 6. Therefore, Mary still needs 6 spoons of sugar to complete her recipe.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.  Since Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar, she needs to add 3 more cups (9 - 4 = 5) of flour to make up for the missing sugar. Therefore, Mary needs 5 additional cups of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour.  Mary has already added 2 cups of flour. So we need to find out how many more cups of flour are needed than cups of sugar. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups of flour already added from the total amount of flour required:  6 cups - 2 cups = 4 cups. Therefore, we need 4 additional cups of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour.  Since she has already added 11 cups of flour, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar are needed than flour. So, we subtract 11 from 5: 5 - 11 = -6. Therefore, the recipe needs 6 more cups of sugar than flour.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to make the dough (she gave it ""pár šálků""). To find out how many more grams of flour she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required (3 Š Álky = 30 g). So, if she needs 30 g - 4 = 26 g more flour."
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 13 cups of flour for her recipe and she has already added some amount of flour. To find out how much more flour she needs, we can use the following formula:

Number of cups needed = Total number of cups - Amount already given

In this case, the total number of cups is 13 (since the recipe requires 13 cups of flour), and the amount already given is x (since Mary has already added some flour). Therefore, to find out how many cups of flour Mary still needs, we can solve the equation as follows:

Number of cups needed = 13 - x

Now, we are told that if Mary still needs 12 cups of flour, then the amount she had already given must be equal to x. So, we can substitute this value into the previous equation:

Number of cups needed = 13 - x
= 13 - 4
= 9

Therefore, Mary still needs 9 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that we need to add 9 šálků mouky (since there are 13 - 7 = 6 remaining). So, if we have already added 7 šálků mouky, then we still need to add 9 - 7 = 2 more šálky mouky. Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 máslové mouky.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour.  If we have already given 12 cups of flour (more than required) and 10 cups of sugar (less than required), then we need to subtract 2 cups of sugar from the total amount needed. So, the number of cups of sugar still needed is:  11 - 10 = 1 cup.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 3 cups of sugar, and we have already added 6 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour are needed, we can subtract the amount of flour we have from the total amount required:

Total amount of flour required = 3 cups + 6 cups = 9 cups
Amount of flour we have = 6 cups
So, we need an additional 3 cups of flour (9 - 6 = 3)."
Response:  We know that we have already added 4 sh of flour to the mixture and the recipe requires 9 sh of flour in total. So, if we want to find out how many more sh of flour are needed, we can subtract the amount we have already added from the required amount: 9 - 4 = 5 sh. Therefore, we need an additional 5 sh of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that we have 2 less than the required amount of flour (9 - 2 = 7). So, to find out how many more spoons of flour are needed, we can divide the number of spoons of flour required by the number of spoons of flour available:  7 / 2 = 3.5  Since you cannot add half a spoon of flour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 4 additional spoons of flour.
Response:  We know that we have to add more sugar than salt because there are already 9 shakes of salt in the recipe and only 6 shakes of sugar. So if we want to add more sugar than salt, we need to subtract 3 shakes of salt from the total amount needed (11 - 9 = 2). Therefore, we need to add 2 shakes of sugar more than salt.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 7 cups of sugar and we have already added 4 cups. So, to find out how many more cups are needed, we can subtract the amount we have from the total required:  7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, Mary still needs 3 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. Since Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar, she needs to add 2 more cups of flour (12 - 10 = 2). Therefore, the correct answer is 2 cups of flour more than the amount of sugar required in the recipe.
Response:  We know that there are currently 19 bird families living near the mountain and that 60 of them have migrated for winter. This means that the number of bird families remaining in the area is 19 - 60 = -41. Therefore, the number of additional bird families that migrated to warmer climates before those that remained is 41.
Response:  We know that there are currently 87 bird families living near the mountain and that 7 of them have migrated to warmer lands for the winter. So, if we subtract 7 from 87, we get 80 remaining bird families.
Response:  We know that 20 bird families migrated away for winter and 14 stayed behind. So, if we subtract the number of birds that left from the total number of bird families living near the mountain, we can find out how many bird families remained.  Therefore, there were initially 34 (20 + 14) bird families living near the mountain before migration.
Response:  We know that 85 bird families live near the mountain and we are given two pieces of information about how many families migrated to different continents:  • 23 bird families migrated to Africa • 37 bird families migrated to Asia Now, let's calculate the number of bird families that remained near the mountain: Total number of bird families = Number of bird families that remained near the mountain + Number of bird families that migrated to Africa + Number of bird families that migrated to Asia To find out how many bird families remained near the mountain, we need to subtract the total number of bird families that migrated from the initial number of bird families living near the mountain: Total number of bird families that remained near the mountain = 85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25 So, there are 25 bird families remaining near the mountain after some families migrated to other continents.
Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain and they migrate to warmer areas during winter.  Out of these, 42 bird families have migrated to Africa and 31 bird families have migrated to Asia. So, we need to find out how many more bird families migrated to Africa than those who migrated to Asia. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of birds that migrated to Africa - Number of birds that migrated to Asia = Difference in migration between Africa and Asia. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of birds that migrated to Africa - Number of birds that migrated to Asia = 42 - 31 = 11. Therefore, 11 more bird families migrated to Africa than those who migrated to Asia.
Response:  We know that 38 bird families live near the mountain and 47 bird families have migrated to Africa. So, we need to find out how many bird families remained in Asia after 47 families left for Africa. To do this, we can subtract the number of families that left for Africa from the total number of bird families living near the mountain:  Number of bird families remaining in Asia = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that migrated to Africa  Number of bird families remaining in Asia = 38 + 94 = 132 bird families Therefore, 132 bird families remained in Asia after 47 families migrated to Africa.
"Response:  We know that 18 bird families live near the mountain and that 38 of them migrated to Africa and 80 of them migrated to Asia. So, we have:

Migrated to Africa = 38 bird families
Migrated to Asia = 80 bird families
Total number of bird families = 18 + 38 + 80 = 206 bird families
Therefore, 206 bird families remained in their original location (near the mountain) during the winter season."
Response:  We know that 87 families of birds live near the mountain during summer and now we are asked how many bird families will live there if 18 new families join them. To find out, let's divide 18 by 87. So, there are 18/87 = 20 new bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 59 bird families left for warmer climates and 24 new bird families arrived from the Arctic to live near the mountain. So, the total number of bird families remaining nearby the mountain is:  59 - 24 = 35. Therefore, there are 35 bird families remaining near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 27 bird families migrated away from their original location near the mountain to warmer areas for winter. This means there are now fewer birds remaining in the area around the mountain.  If initially there were 41 bird families living nearby the mountain, then after 27 families migrated away, there would be 41 - 27 = 14 bird families left behind.
Response:  We know that 86 bird families migrated away from their summer homes to warmer climates for winter and we also know that among those who left, only 45 bird families remained near the mountain. So, the number of bird families that did not migrate (i.e., stayed near the mountain) is equal to the total number of bird families that migrated away minus the number of bird families that stayed near the mountain.  Therefore, the answer is:  Number of bird families that did not migrate = Total number of bird families that migrated away - Number of bird families that stayed near the mountain = 86 - 45 = 41.
Response:  We know that 41 bird families live near the mountain and 35 of them have migrated to Asia. So, there are 41 - 35 = 6 bird families left in the area. Now we are told that 62 bird families have migrated to Africa from this area. Therefore, the number of bird families that have not migrated to either Asia or Africa is 6 + 62 = 68.
"Response:  We know that 26 new bird families arrived from the Arctic and stayed near the mountain, while 2 bird families left for warmer climates. So, the total number of bird families near the mountain is:

Total = Number of existing bird families + Number of new bird families - Number of departed bird families
= 3 + 26 - 2
= 31

Therefore, there are 31 bird families near the mountain."
Response:  We know that Paul had 253 pastries at his birthday party and he either lost or gave away 70 of them. So, if we subtract 70 from 253, we get 183. Therefore, at the end of the school year, Paul has 183 pastries left.
Response:  We know that Paul had 551 balloons at the beginning of the school year and he either lost or gave away 374 balloons. So, he has 177 balloons left. Now, we need to find out how many pastels Paul received for his birthday. According to the question, Paul received 20 pastels for his birthday. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 111 pastries to his friends during the school year and lost 106 pastries himself. So he has 111 - 106 = 5 pastries left.
Response:  We know that Paul had 65 pastels at his birthday party and gave away 213 during school year. So he lost 16 pastels. Therefore, the number of pastels that were either lost or given away is 213 - 16 = 207.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 571 pastries to his friends during the school year and lost 161 of them. So he has 410 remaining (571 - 161 = 410). Now we need to find out how many more pastries he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number he lost from the total number he gave away: 410 - 161 = 249. Therefore, Paul gave away 249 more pastries to his friends than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 90 pastries to his friends during the school year and lost 412 more. So he had 322 left at first (412 - 90 = 322). Now we need to find out how many additional pastries he lost after giving them away. To do this, we subtract the number of pastries he gave away from the total number he had left: 322 - 90 = 232. Therefore, Paul lost an additional 232 pastries after giving some away.
Response:  We know that Paul gave his friends 563 pastels during the school year and lost 558 of them. So he has 75 left (563 - 558 = 75). If he had only 332 pastels left after giving some to his friends, then he must have given away all but 332 / 75 = 4 pastels for his birthday. Therefore, Paul gave 4 pastels for his birthday.
"Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 pastels during the school year and lost 535 pastels. So, he had 492 remaining pastels initially. Now, we need to find out how many of those were lost or given away. To do this, we can use the information provided in the question: ""Paul ztratil 535 pastelů."" This means that he lost 535 - 52 = 483 pastels. Therefore, the number of pastels that Paul had left after giving some away and losing some is: 492 - 483 = 10."
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the school year, Paul had 521 pastries and 66 pieces of gum. If he didn't lose any gum, then he must have given away or eaten some pastries. So let's call the number of pastries he gave away or ate x. Then we can write an equation based on the information provided in the question: Number of pastries = Initial amount - Amount given away or eaten (x)  Now we are told that after the end of the school year, Paul was left with 154 pastries. So if we subtract the number of pastries he gave away or ate from the initial amount, we get: Number of pastries = 521 - x = 154  Finally, we want to find out how many pastries were given away or eaten. To do this, we divide the number of pastries given away or eaten by the total number of pastries initially available: Number of pastries given away or eaten = x / 521 = 308  Therefore, Paul gave away or ate 308 pastries during the school year.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 531 pastries and 38 pieces of gum. If he didn't lose any gum, then he must have eaten 38/531 = 0.072 pastries for each piece of gum. So after eating one piece of gum, he has 531 - (0.072 \* 38) = 463 pastries left. At the end of the school year, he had 391 pastries left, so he ate 463 - 391 = 72 pastries during the school year. Therefore, there are still 72 pastries left when he finished eating all the gum.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the school year, Paul had 406 pieces of gum and he gave away 601 pastries with an average size of 25g per pastry (since there are 406 pieces of gum). So, he gave away a total of 601 x 25 = 15025g of gum. Now we need to find out how much gum is left after giving it all away. To do this, we subtract the amount of gum given away from the initial amount of gum: 406 - 15025 = 14981g. Finally, we want to know how many more gum sticks Paul has left. To do this, we divide the remaining amount of gum by the number of gum sticks he initially had: 14981 / 406 = 367. Therefore, Paul has 367 additional gum sticks left.
Response:  We know that Paul had 315 balloons at first and he lost or gave away 315 of them. So, if he has only 291 balloons left at the end of the school year, it means that he must have received 24 (291 - 315 = 24) new balloons as gifts for his birthday. Therefore, Paul got 24 pastel balloons for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 308 pastries to his friends during the school year and lost 231 of them. So he has 77 left (308 - 231 = 77). Now we need to find out how many more pastries he gave away than he lost. To do this, we divide the number of pastries he gave away by the number he lost: 77 / 231 = 0.3295... This means that for every pastry he lost, he gave away 0.3295... more. Therefore, the answer is 329.
"Response:  We know that at birthday party, Paul had 457 gummies and 320 pastries. At the end of the school year, he had 523 pieces left (gummi + pastries). So, we can write an equation:  Total = Gummies + Pastries. Now, let's solve for ""Gummies"": Gummies = Total - Pastries Substituting the value we know: Gummies = 523 - 320 = 203 So, there are 203 gummies left after Paul didn't lose any of them."
"Response:  We know that initially, one waiter had 11 customers. If some of them left, we can assume that there were fewer customers. Let's say three customers left. So, the number of customers the waiter had after they left is:

11 - 3 = 8

So, there were 8 customers remaining after some of the original customers left."
Response:  At first, Číšník had 3 customers (C1, C2, and C3). Then some of them left, leaving him with 4 customers (C1, C2, C3, and C4). So, the number of customers that remained after some of them left is 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, there were 1 customer who stayed with Číšník after some of his original customers left.
Response:  If Číšník had 9 customers when 9 of them left, he would have 0 customers left. So, at first, he must have had 9 + 12 = 21 customers.
Response:  We know that the cashier had 14 customers initially and now there are only 5 left. So, we can deduce that the number of customers the cashier originally had is equal to the number of customers he has left minus the number of customers he currently has.  In other words, the number of customers the cashier originally had is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, the cashier still has 9 customers.
Response:  At first, Číšník had 13 customers (C). Then some of them left (L), so he had fewer customers. He gained 4 new customers (N), so the total number of customers was C - L + N = 13 - X + 4 = 9, where X is the number of customers who left. Therefore, there were 9 customers remaining with Číšník.
Response:  If the cashier had 12 customers initially and 15 of them left, then he has 12 - 15 = -3 fewer customers. Now, if he gained 14 new customers, that means he has +14 = 11 more customers than before (since he started with -3 fewer). So, in total, the cashier now has 11 + 12 = 23 customers.
Response:  The initial number of customers was 3 (číšník). When additional customers arrived, there were 8 customers in total (osm zákazníků). So, the new customers that came are: 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, one waiter had eight customers (8). Then some left and he still had five customers (5). So initially, there were 13 customers in total (8 + 5 = 13). Now, he gained 99 new customers, so the final number of customers is:  13 + 99 = 112. Therefore, there are 112 customers in total.
Response:  At first, Číšník had 12 customers (given). Then some of them left and he had 14 customers remaining (also given). Finally, he gained 10 new customers (given). So, in total, Číšník has now 24 customers.
Response:  At first, Danovi had $3 dollars. Then he spent $2 dollars to buy chocolate. So, now he has $1 dollar left. Therefore, at the beginning, Danovi had $3 dollars.
Response:  If Dan had $4 and bought chocolate that cost x dollars, then he would have $4 - x dollars left after buying the chocolate. So, we can write an equation:  $4 = x + (3). Since Dan had $3 before buying the chocolate, we know that (3) = $3, so x = $1. Therefore, the chocolate cost $1.
Response:  If Dan has $4 and buys 99 chocolates for $3 each, he will spend a total of $297 (99 x $3). So, after buying the chocolates, he will have $4 - $297 = -$293 left. Therefore, there is negative $293 remaining.
Response:  If Dan has $3 and bought 2 pencils for $4, then he spent all of his money ($3) to buy those pencils. So, each pencil cost him half of his remaining amount ($3 / 2 = $1.50).
Response:  If he has $2 and bought each pair of socks for $6, then he spent a total of $2 + $6 = $8. So, he must have bought $\frac{8}{3} = 2$ pairs of socks.
Response:  First, he spent $2 for chocolate that cost $2. So, he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he spent another $3 for chocolate that cost $3. So, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, he has $2 left.
Response:  The first chocolate cost $7, so he spent $7 + $7 = $14 on both chocolates. Therefore, he spent $14 - $4 = $10 on the two chocolates.
Response:  The first chocolate cost $6, so he spent $6 + $3 = $9 on both chocolates. Therefore, he spent $9 for the two chocolates before he bought the third one.
Response:  He spent $2 for chocolate that costs $2 per dollar = $4. Then he spent $3 for chocolate that costs $3 per dollar = $9. So in total, he spent $4 + $9 = $13.
"Response: 
Dan had $4 dollars and bought chocolate for $8. So he spent $8 - $4 = $4. Now his friend gave him $5, so he got $5 + $4 = $9. Therefore, he has $9 left."
Response:  If he had $3 at first and bought chocolate for $2, then he has $1 left ($3 - $2 = $1). So, the cost of the chocolate is $2.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spent $3 for 10 chocolate sticks. So, he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.
Response:  We know that Dan paid $4 for 2 chocolate sticks, so he paid $4 / 2 = $2 per stick. Therefore, each chocolate stick cost $2.
Response:  He spent $3 for one chocolate and $7 for another chocolate. So he spent a total of $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent $10 before buying the third chocolate.
Response:  Firstly, he bought chocolate for $7, so he spent $7 + tax = $8. Then, he bought another piece of chocolate for $2, so he spent an additional $2. Therefore, in total, he spent $8 + $2 = $10.
Response:  If Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them, then he has 37 books left with him.
Response:  At the beginning, Paul had some books (let's call it x). After selling 137 of them in a garage sale, he was left with 105 books. So, we can write an equation: x - 137 = 105. Now, solve for x: x = 205. Therefore, Paul had 205 books at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and he sold some of them in a garage sale. After selling some books, he gave 35 books to his friend, which means he has 62 books left with him. So, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is equal to 62 - 108 = -46 books. Therefore, Paul did not sell any books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and after buying some in sale, he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books Paul had = 50.  After buying some in sale, number of books Paul had = 151 - x, where x is the number of books he bought. Now, we are given that Paul bought p books in sale. Therefore, we can substitute x = p in the above equation to get: Number of books Paul had = 50 + (151 - p). Solving for p, we get: p = 79. So, Paul bought 79 books in sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had two books initially and sold them at a garage sale for $20 each. So he made $40 from selling those two books. Then, when he bought new books, he spent $150 to buy 150 of them. Since he already has 58 books, we can subtract the number of books he already had (58) from the total number of books he bought (150). Therefore, the number of books he sold is equal to $150 - $40 = $110.
Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books and sold them at a garage sale. He then bought 42 new books. So far, he has gained 42 - 21 = 21 new books. Now we are told that he has 15 books left. Therefore, he must have sold 21 + 15 = 36 books in total.
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and sold them for $20 each. So he made $1420 from selling those books. Then he used that money to buy 38 new books at $50 each. That means he spent $1900 on buying new books. Now we are asked how many more books he bought after selling his old ones. To find this out, we need to subtract the amount he spent on buying new books ($1900) from the total amount of money he made from selling his old books ($1420). This gives us $200. Therefore, Paul bought $200 worth of additional books after selling his old ones.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. So, we can calculate how many books he sold as follows: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Remaining number of books = 108 - 66 = 42 books Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 106 pens and 51 books. If he sold some of them, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold Number of pens = Initial number of pens - Number of pens sold Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Number of books = 51 - x Number of pens = 106 - y Where x is the number of books sold and y is the number of pens sold. Since Paul had 82 books after selling some, we can set up the following equation: 51 - x = 82 Substituting x = 31 (the difference between 51 and 82), we get: 106 - 31 = 75 So Paul sold 31 pens and 31 books.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 136 books initially and he sold some of them in the garage sale. So, let's say he sold x books. Now we have:

Number of books left with Paul = 136 - x

We also know that there are 27 books left with him. Therefore, we can write an equation:

x + 27 = 136

Now solve for x:

x = 109

So, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left with him. Now, we are told that he sold some of these books at a sale and ended up with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books he sold is 68 - 95 = -27 books. Since negative numbers cannot be sold, the correct answer is 0 books were sold at the sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 95 books and 153 books at some point in time. When he sold some of his books and pens, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, to find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he had after selling from the total number of books he initially had:  Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books after sale  = 95 - 13  = 82 books  Therefore, Paul sold 82 books at the auction.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 books and 143 books. If he sold some of them at the garage sale, then he has fewer books left. So, we can write an equation:  Books = Initial books - Sold books.  In this case, the initial number of books was 42 + 143 = 185 books. Since he sold some books, let's say he sold x books. Then, we can substitute the value of x into the equation: Books = 185 - x. Now, we are given that after selling some books and per, he has 113 books and 19 per left. So, we can solve for x by substituting these values into the equation: 113 = 185 - x. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 72. Therefore, Paul sold 72 books at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, there were ten roses in the vase. Then, Jessica removed eight more roses from her garden and gave them to the vase. So, now there are... (10 - 8) = 2 roses left in the vase.
Response:  At the beginning, there were 16 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica added another 16 roses from her garden, so now there are 32 roses in total (16 + 16). Therefore, the number of roses in the vase at the beginning was 16.
Response:  Jessica removed 4 roses from the vase and then planted new ones in her garden to give them away. So, there are now 23 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of roses she removed (4) from the total number of roses in the vase (23). Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  Jessica removed 33 roses from the vase and then planted new ones in her garden to add more to the vase. So, there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica had originally, we need to subtract the number of roses she removed (33) from the total number of roses in the vase at first (15). Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  Jessica removed 34 roses from the vase and then planted new ones in her garden to add more flowers to the vase. So, there are now 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses Jessica planted than she took away, we need to subtract the number of roses she took away (34) from the current number of roses in the vase (15):  34 - 15 = 19 Therefore, Jessica planted 19 more roses than she took away.
Response:  We know that there were originally seven roses in the vase and then Jessica removed another rose from her garden which had 59 roses in total. So, after removing one rose, there are now 20 roses left in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses that Jessica cut was 7 (the original number) - 1 (the rose she removed from her garden).
Response:  We know that Jessica has already removed one rose from her garden, which had 12 roses in total. So, after removing one rose, there are now 11 roses left in the garden. Then, we are told that Jessica has added another rose to the garden, making it have 12 roses again. Therefore, if there were originally 12 roses in the garden and then Jessica added one more rose, then there must be 13 roses in the garden right now!
Response:  We know that in the beginning there were 15 roses and 62 orchids. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. So, we can say that she removed x roses and y orchids. Now, let's find out how many roses are left after removing them. We know that before removing any roses, there were 15 roses. After removing x roses, there will be 15 - x roses left. Similarly, after removing y orchids, there will be 62 - y orchids left. Therefore, the number of roses left after removing x = 15 - x and the number of orchids left after removing y = 62 - y. Now, we need to find out what values of x and y satisfy these two equations simultaneously. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 3 and y = 40. So, Jessica removed 3 roses and 40 orchids from her garden. To summarize, the final number of roses is 15 - 3 = 12 and the final number of orchids is 62 - 40 = 22.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica removed some of them from her garden to put into the vase. After she did this, there were 10 roses and 2 orchids left in the vase. So, we can say that Jessica removed 2 roses and 2 orchids from the vase (since there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids). Therefore, the number of orchids that Jessica cut was 2.
Response:  We know that in the original container there were 5 roses and 3 orchids.  If Jessica removed some of them from her garden, then we can say that she put 12 roses and 2 orchids into the new container. So, if we compare how many roses are in the new container with how many orchids are in it, we see that there are more roses than orchids. Therefore, the number of roses is greater than the number of orchids by 7 (12 - 5).
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 róži and 12 orchids in the basket. Then Jessica removed some more roses from her garden and put them into the basket, so now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the basket. To find out how many more orchids than roses there are, we can subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers: 11 - 7 = 4. So, there are 4 more orchids than roses in the basket.
Response:  If there were originally 3 roses in the vase and Jessica took out 16 roses from her garden to put into the vase, then she must have taken out 16 - 3 = 13 more roses than there were already in the vase. So, Jessica cut 13 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that in the beginning there were 13 roses and 84 orchids. Then Jessica removed some more roses from her garden, so now there are fewer roses than before. Specifically, she has 9 less roses than at first (9 - 13 = -4). Similarly, we can calculate how many orchids she has after removing some of them from her garden. She had 84 orchids initially, but then she removed 20 orchids (-20 = -2), leaving her with 64 orchids. So, in total, Jessica has 91 orchids and 14 roses left in her garden. Therefore, the number of roses she cut was 14.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in Jessica's garden. Then she removed some of them from her garden to make room for new plants. After removing some of the plants, there were 7 orchids and 13 roses left in the garden. So, we can say that Jessica removed 9 orchids (16 - 7 = 9) and 10 roses (3 - 13 = 10). Therefore, Jessica removed 9 orchids and 10 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 růže and 20 orchidejí in the basket. Then Jessica added another rose to her garden, so now there are 7 růže in total (including the new one). As for the orchids, she removed 2 from her garden, leaving only 18 orchidejí in the basket. Therefore, the number of růže in the basket is greater than the number of orchidejí by 7 - 3 = 4. So, there are 4 more růže than orchidejí in the basket.
Response:  We know that in the original state there were 9 roses and 6 orchids. Then Jessica removed some more roses from her garden, so now there are fewer roses than before. But she also added some orchids to the same container! So let's calculate how many orchids are left after removing the roses: Number of orchids = Total number of orchids - Number of orchids originally in the container (6) Now we have 13 orchids in total, including those added later. Therefore, the difference between the number of orchids and roses is: Difference = Number of orchids - Number of roses = 13 - 9 = 4 orchids There are 4 more orchids than roses in the container.
Response:  We know that Robinovy vlasy were originally long for 17 inches or 43 cm. Then she cut off some hair and now they are 13 inches or 33 cm long. So, if we subtract the length of her original hair from the current length, we get the number of inches she cut off: 43 - 33 = 10 inches (or 25 cm). Therefore, Robin cut off 10 inches (or 25 cm) of her hair.
Response:  Before she cut her hair, Robin had 20 inches of hair. If now she has 10 inches of hair, then she lost 10 - 20 = 10 inches of hair. So, before she got her haircut, Robin had 20 - 10 = 10 inches of hair.
Response:  The original length of Robinovy vlasy was 16 inches (palc). Then she cut them short by 11 inches, so they were 5 inches long (16 - 11 = 5). Later, her hair grew back by 12 inches, so now it is 17 inches long (5 + 12 = 17). Therefore, Robinovy vlasy are currently 17 inches long.
Response:  When Robinovy vlasy were long 19 inches, they measured 19 x 12 = 228 inches. Now, if they grew by 18 inches, their current length would be 228 + 18 = 246 inches.
Response:  If Robin had originally 14 inches of hair and cut off 13 inches, then she has 1 inch left now. So her current length is 14 - 13 = 1 inch.
Response:  The original length of Robinovy vlasy was 14 inches (palc). Then it grew by 8 inches, so now they are 22 inches long (14 + 8 = 22). Finally, she cut off 20 inches, leaving them 2 inches long (22 - 20 = 2). So, Robinovy vlasy are currently 2 inches long.
Response:  We know that Danny had 12 pens in his collection initially. Then, he found 53 more pens in the park. So, now Danny has 65 pens (12 + 53).
"Response:  We know that Danny had 21 pencils in his collection initially. Then he found more pencils in the park, which means he now has 53 pencils in total. So, we can say:

Number of pencils Danny found in the park = Total number of pencils Danny has - Initial number of pencils Danny had
= 53 - 21
= 32

Therefore, Danny found 32 pencils in the park."
Response:  We know that Danny collected 63 víčky from the trees and threw away 51 old ones. So he has 33 víčky left in his collection now. To find out how many víčky Danny had at the beginning, we can divide the number of víčky he collected (63) by the number of víčky he still has (33). Therefore, Danny had 20 víček at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 víček from the trees and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 víček left in his collection now. To find out how many víček Danny found after throwing away the old ones, we can subtract the number of old víček (35) from the total number of víček he found (36): 36 - 35 = 1. Therefore, Danny found 1 additional víček after throwing away the old ones.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 pinecones in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he has 42 pinecones left in his collection after throwing away the old ones. Now we are asked how many more pinecones Danny threw away than the ones he found in the park. To find this difference, we can subtract the number of pinecones he found from the total number of pinecones he threw away:  Number of pinecones thrown away = 63 - 30 = 33  Therefore, Danny threw away 33 additional pinecones beyond the ones he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 víčky and 8 obál in the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 vícky and obál at first. Then he collected more vícky and obál from the park, so his new collection is 28 vícky and 63 obál. Therefore, Danny had 30 - 28 = 2 vícky and 63 - 8 = 55 obál at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 víčky and 30 obalů in the park. So he had 22 + 30 = 52 objects at first. Then he collected 17 víček and 57 obalů. Therefore, Danny had 52 - 17 = 35 obalů at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 vícky and 14 obál in the park. Now he has 7 vícky and 86 obál in his collection. To find out how many vícky Danny found in the park, we can subtract the number of vícky he already had from the total number of vícky he found: 7 - 3 = 4 vícky. So Danny found 4 vícky in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 víček and 28 obalů in the park. So he now has 68 vícky and 51 obálů in his collection. To find out how many obálů Danny found more than vícky, we need to subtract the number of vícky from the total number of obálů: 51 - 11 = 40. Therefore, Danny found 40 obálů more than vícky in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny initially found 71 vícky and 24 obálu in the park. He then collected 28 vícky and 16 obálu from his collection. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of vícky = Initial number of vícky + Number of vícky collected = 71 + 28 = 99 Total number of obálu = Initial number of obálu + Number of obálu collected = 24 + 16 = 30 Now, we want to find out how many vícky Danny has more than obálu. To do this, we subtract the total number of obálu from the total number of vícky: Excess número de vícky over obálu = Total number of vícky - Total number of obálu = 99 - 30 = 69 Therefore, Danny has 69 más vícky than obálu.
Response:  We know that Danny found 10 víček and 62 obál in the park. So he had 72 obál before he started collecting them (10 víček x 62 obál = 620). Now he has 43 obál left after collecting some of them. To find out how many obál Danny has more than víček, we need to subtract the number of obál he has now from the total number of obál he had before: 620 - 43 = 577 obál. Therefore, Danny has 577 obál more than víček.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 víck in the park and now he has 25 víck left. So, if we subtract the number of víck he lost from the total number of víck he had at the beginning, we can find out how many víck he had initially. Therefore, the answer is 66 - 25 = 41 víck.
Response:  If Danny had 25 víček in his collection and found 32 víček in the park, then he gained 7 víček (32 - 25 = 7).
Response:  We know that Danny collected 67 víček in total and he threw away 60 old ones from the park. So, the number of new víček he found is:  67 - 60 = 7. Therefore, Danny had 7 líálové víček at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 50 new pebbles after throwing away 6 old ones. So, he had 6 + 50 = 56 pebbles in his collection before he started collecting more. Now, we are told that he found additional pebbles while searching the park. Therefore, the total number of pebbles Danny found is equal to the original amount plus the additional ones he found. In other words, 56 + x = 60, where x is the number of additional pebbles Danny found. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So, Danny found 4 additional pebbles while searching the park.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 54 old tickets and found 48 new ones in the park. So he gained 48 - 54 = -16 new tickets. Then we are told that he now has 52 tickets in his collection. This means that he must have thrown away additional tickets after finding those in the park, which is equal to -16 + x =?, where x is the number of tickets he threw away after collecting the ones in the park. Solving for x, we get x = 70. Therefore, Danny threw away 70 more tickets after collecting the ones in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 82 bottle caps and 29 corks in the park. So he collected 42 corks and 61 bottle caps. To find out how many drinking cups Danny had at the beginning, we need to divide the number of corks he collected by 3 (since each cork is equivalent to one drinking cup). Therefore, Danny had 42 / 3 = 14 drinking cups at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 66 obalů and 39 víček in the park. So he had 66 + 39 = 105 objects at first. Then he collected 16 víček and 68 obalů. Therefore, he has now 105 - 16 = 89 objects left, which is equal to 68 obalů.  So, Danny had 68 obalů at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 obalů and 50 víček from the park. Now he has 21 víček and 52 obalů in his collection. To find out how many obalů Danny found in the park, we can subtract the number of obalů he already had (52) from the total number of obalů he collected (46): 46 - 52 = -16. So Danny found -16 obálů in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 packaging and bottles in the park. He now has 31 bottle caps and 9 bottles in his collection. So he must have collected more bottle caps than he found in the park. Therefore, the number of bottle caps Danny found in the park is equal to the difference between the total number of bottle caps he found and the number of bottle caps he already had plus the number of bottles he found minus the number of bottles he already had.  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Number of bottle caps Danny found in the park = Total number of bottle caps - (Number of bottle caps he already had + Number of bottles he found)  Number of bottle caps Danny found in the park = 65 - (31 + 9)  Number of bottle caps Danny found in the park = 65 - 40  Number of bottle caps Danny found in the park = 25  Therefore, Danny found 25 more bottle caps in the park than he already had.
Response:  We know that Danny had 58 vícky and 25 obál in the park. So he collected 11 obál and 12 vícky now. To find out how many vícky Danny has more than obál, we need to subtract the number of obál from the total number of vícky. Therefore, the answer is: 12 vícky - 11 obál = 1 vícka more than obál.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 67 obalů and 35 víček. To find out how many more obalů he has than víček, we can subtract the number of víček from the number of obalů:  67 - 35 = 32 So, Danny has 32 more obalů than víček.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccolis than Steven. If Jake has 11 broccolis less than Steven, then Steven has 11 + 1 = 12 more broccolis than Jake. So if Jake has 17 broccolis, then Steven has 12 + 1 = 13 broccolis. Therefore, Steven has 13 broccolis.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccoli than Steven. If we subtract the number of broccoli that Steven has from the total number of broccoli, we will find out how many broccoli Jake has. So, if Steven has 15 broccoli and Jake has fewer than him, then Jake must have x broccoli where x is the difference between the two numbers. Therefore, Jake has 7 - (15 - x) = 7 - 8 = 0 broccoli.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccoli than Steven, and Steven has more broccoli than Jill. So, if we subtract the number of broccoli that Jake has from the total number of broccoli that Steven has, we will get the number of broccoli that Jill has. Therefore, the answer is:  Jill has 4 broccoli (19 - 18 = 4).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskvi than Steven and more broskvi than Jill. So we can start with Jake's number of broskvi and subtract the difference between his number and Steven's number to find out how many he has more than Jill. Then we add five (Steven's number) to this result to get Jake's final number of broskvi. Here is the calculation:
Jake - (Jake's # broskvi - Steven's # broskvi) + 5 = Jake's # broskvi
Let's plug in the numbers:
Jake - (3 - 8) + 5 = Jake's # broskvi
= Jake - 5 + 5
= Jake + 0
So Jake has zero more broskvi than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has 4 broskvi more than Jake (Jake has 12 - 4 = 8). So if we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, we get: 8 - 4 = 4. Therefore, Jill has 4 more broskvi than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccoli than Steven and more than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x broccoli, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Jake has x broccoli < Steven has 16 broccoli
Jake has x broccoli > Jill has 7 broccoli

Now, let's solve for x using substitution or elimination method. Since there are no negative numbers involved, we will use the substitution method. Solving for x, we get:

x = 9 (since Jake has 9 more broccoli than Jill)

So, Jake has 9 broccoli."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 broskvi and more than 8 broskvi than Jill. So, if we subtract 7 from Jake's number of broskvi, we will get an integer less than or equal to 8. Therefore, Jill must have at least 8 broskvi.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 9 broskvi and more than 18 broskvi than Jill. So, Jake must have between 10-17 broskvi. Now we know that Steven has 16 broskvi, so he must have at least 16 - 10 = 6 broskvi more than Jake. Therefore, Steven has 6 + 16 = 22 broskvi more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccolis than Steven. So, if Jake has x broccolis, then Steven has x + 6 broccolis.  Since Jill has more broccolis than both Jake and Steven combined, we can say that Jill has (x + 6) + (x + 6) = 2(x + 6) broccolis.  Now, since Jill has five broccolis, we can set up an equation as follows: 5 = 2(x + 6). Solving for x, we get: x = -3. Therefore, Jake has -3 broccolis.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broccolis than Steven and more broccolis than Jill. So if Jake has x broccolis less than Steven, he must have x + 18 = 87 more broccolis than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 87 - (x + 18) = 69 broccolis more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 15 broccoli, so he must have at least 16 - 15 = 1 broccoli.  Now we know that Jake has fewer than 16 broccoli, so he must have less than or equal to 16 - 1 = 15 broccoli.  Finally, we know that Jill has more than 12 broccoli, so she must have at least 13 - 12 = 1 broccoli more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer carrots than Steven and more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of apples from the total number of vegetables, we can find out how many carrots Jake has.  Therefore, Jake has 12 - 79 = -67 carrots.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer carrots than Steven and more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of carrots Jake has from the total number of carrots, we will get the number of apples he has.  Therefore, the answer is: Jake has 20 apples (13 - 6 = 20).
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer broccoli than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven. So, if we write it down as an equation:
Jake has 6 fewer broccoli = -6
And Jake has 8 more apples = +8
Now let's find out how many broccoli Steven has:
Steven has 17 broccoli - (6 x -6) = 17 - 36 = 19 broccoli
So, Steven has 19 broccoli more than Jake. Now, let's find out how many apples Steven has:
Steven has 16 apples + 8 = 24 apples
Therefore, Steven has 24 apples more than Jake."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and more apples than Steven. So, if we compare their fruit quantities directly, we can see that Jake has 3 fewer pears than Steven (Jake has 9 - 12 = 3 fewer pears) and 10 more apples than Steven (Jake has 15 - 12 = 3 more apples). Now, let's find out how many apples Steven has more than brothnuts. Since Steven has 12 brothnuts, he must have x apples more than brothnuts. Therefore, the difference between Steven's apple quantity and brothnut quantity is equal to x. So, the number of apples Steven has more than brothnuts is 3 (since Jake has 3 fewer pears than Steven).
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 broskvi and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x broskvi. Since Jill has 67 broskyň less than Steven, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake + 67 = Steven - 67  Substituting the value of x (the number of broskvi Jake has) into this equation, we get:  x + 67 = 12 - 67  Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:  x = 59  Therefore, Jake has 59 broskvi.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 broskví and Jake has fewer than 18 broskví. So, we can say that Jake has x broskví where x is less than or equal to 18. Also, we know that Steven has more broskví than Jill, so we can write an inequality statement as follows: x + 8 > 18. Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies all these conditions. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Substituting x = 10 in the inequality statement, we get 10 + 8 > 18, which simplifies to 18 > 10, giving us x = 8. Therefore, Jill has 8 broskví.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 broskvi and Jill has fewer than 19 broskvi. So, we can say that Jill has x broskvi where x is less than or equal to 19. Also, we know that Jake has more broskvi than Jill but fewer than Steven. So, we can write an inequality equation as follows:  x + 72 < 19. Now, let's solve for x using substitution method.  First, we will solve the inequality equation for x:  x + 72 < 19.  Subtracting 72 from both sides gives us:  x < 108.  Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x = 54. Therefore, Jake has 54 broskvi.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 broskví and Jake has fewer than 14 broskví. So, Jake must have at least 8 broskví (since he cannot have more than 14). Now we also know that Jill has fewer broskví than both Steven and Jake. Therefore, Jill has exactly 9 broskví.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer broskvi than Steven. So, if Jake has x broskvi, then Steven has x + 13 broskvi. Therefore, we can write an equation:
Jake = x (less than Steven)
x = (Steven - Jake) / 13
Substituting the values given in the question:
x = (52 - 84) / 13
x = -36
So, Jake has -36 broskvi."
Response:  We know that Jake has more pineapples than Steven. So, if Jake has x pineapples, then Steven has x - 13 pineapples. Also, we know that Steven has 8 broccolis and Jake has fewer broccolis than Steven. Therefore, Jake has x - 17 broccolis. Now, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for x: x = (x - 13) + 8 = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, Jake has 9 pineapples.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steve and more apples than Steve. So, if we compare their fruit quantities directly, we can see that Jake has 8 less pears than Steve (8 - 11 = -3). On the other hand, Jake has 10 more apples than Steve (18 - 8 = +10). Therefore, Steve has 3 more pears than Jake (-3).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more pears than Steven. So, if we compare their fruit quantities directly, we can see that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven (Jake has 3 broskyň méně). Also, Jake has 4 more pears than Steven (Jake has o 4 jablka víc). Therefore, we can conclude that Steven has 3 + 4 = 7 more jars of jam than Jake.
Response:  The total amount of money Olivia had was $78. She spent $15 in the supermarket, so now she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.
"Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she has $33 left, then we can write an equation as follows:

$78 = $33 + x

where x is the amount of money that Olivia had originally.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting $33 from both sides of the equation:

$45 = x

Therefore, Olivia had $45 originally."
Response:  The initial amount of money in Olivia's purse was $100. She took out another $148 from an ATM. After visiting the supermarket, there were $159 left in her purse. So, the total amount that Olivia spent is: $148 + $159 = $297.
Response:  The initial amount of money in Olivia's purse was $3. Then she took out another $49 from an ATM. After that, she spent $49 at the supermarket. So, if we subtract the amount she spent ($49) from the total amount she had ($49 + $3 = $52), we get the amount she has left: $52 - $49 = $3. Therefore, Olivia took away $3 more than she spent at the supermarket.
Response:  The total amount of money that Olivia had was $53 + $91 = $144. She spent $144 - $14 = $130 at the supermarket. So, she uratated more money at the supermarket than she gained from the ATM ($91 - $14 = $77). Therefore, the correct answer is $77.
Response:  The total amount of money that Olivia had was $106. After visiting the supermarket and spending some money there, she had $75 left. Then, she went to the showroom and spent $49. So, the amount of money she spent in the supermarket is $75 - $49 = $26.
Response:  If Olivia had $54 in her purse and spent $29 at the supermarket, then she has $ -15 left = $35.
"Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her purse initially, then we can write an equation as follows:

$128 - $38 = x

where x is the amount of money left with Olivia after spending $38 at the supermarket.

Now, to solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $38 from both sides of the equation:

$128 - $38 = $90

So, Olivia has $90 left in her purse after spending $38 at the supermarket."
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 applications left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
"Response:  At the beginning, Dave had 18 applications on his phone. When he deleted 18 of them, he was left with 5 apps. So, to find out how many applications Dave had at the beginning, we can divide the number of remaining apps (5) by the total number of apps he had initially (18):

5 / 18 = 3

Therefore, Dave had 3 applications on his phone at the beginning."
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones. So, he now has 21 applications in total (10 + 11 = 21). If we subtract the number of applications that were deleted (4), we get the final number of applications that Dave still had after deleting some - 4. Therefore, the answer is 17 (21 - 4 = 17).
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and added 89 new ones. So, his total number of applications is: 21 + 89 = 106. Now, he deleted some of them, leaving him with 24 applications. Therefore, the number of additional applications that Dave added before deleting any is: 106 - 24 = 82.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications initially and then added 71 new ones. So, in total he had 86 applications (15 + 71). When he deleted some of them, there were left 14 applications. To find out how many applications Dave deleted before adding new ones, we need to subtract the number of applications he had after deleting from the total number of applications he had at first. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of applications Dave deleted = Total number of applications - Number of applications after deleting = 86 - 14 = 72
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files initially. After some of them were deleted, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of applications = Initial number of applications - Number of applications after deletion (5) Number of files = Initial number of files - Number of files after deletion (23) Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of applications = 16 - 5 = 11 Number of files = 77 - 23 = 54 Therefore, Dave deleted 9 applications (16 - 5 = 9).
"Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files initially. If he deleted some of them, we can assume that he deleted at least 3 applications (since he only mentioned that he deleted ""several""). Therefore, the number of applications he had after deleting some is:

17 - 3 = 14

Similarly, if he deleted several files, we can assume that he deleted at least 7 files (again, since he only mentioned that he deleted ""several""). So, the number of files he had after deleting some is:

21 - 7 = 14

Therefore, the total number of applications and files that Dave deleted is:

14 + 14 = 28

So, Dave deleted 28 items in total."
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. To find out how many more applications than files he has, we need to subtract the number of files from the total number of applications: 21 - 4 = 17. So, Dave has 17 more applications than files on his phone.
Response:  We know that after deleting some apps and files, Dave had 6 apps and 15 files left on his phone. To find out how many more files he has than apps, we can subtract the number of apps from the total number of files: 6 (apps) + 15 (files) = 21. So, there are 21 additional files on Dave's phone beyond the 6 apps.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications on his mobile phone and I added one more application to it, then he would have 18 applications in total. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 12 applications and 30 files left. So, he must have deleted 7 applications (12 - 5 = 7) and 48 files (30 - 59 = 48). Therefore, Dave deleted 7 applications and 48 files.
Response:  We know that after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 17 applications and 21 files left. So, he must have deleted at least 5 applications (since there were initially 24) and at least 8 files (since there were initially 24). Therefore, Dave deleted 5 + 8 = 13 items in total.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, the number of additional applications is equal to 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Dave has 7 more applications than files on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files initially. When he deleted some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, in total, he has 26 items (24 files + 2 apps) remaining on his phone after deleting some of them. Therefore, the number of additional files beyond applications is 26 - 2 = 24.
Response:  If Nell had 242 baseball cards and gave 136 of them to Jeff, then she has 242 - 136 = 106 remaining cards.
Response:  If Nell had originally 301 baseball cards and gave 154 to Jeff, then she must have started with x = 301.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and Jeff had 11 cards initially. So, if we subtract the number of cards Jeff had from the total number of cards Nell had, we get: 528 - 11 = 517. Now, we are told that after giving some cards to Jeff, he has 252 cards left. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is: 252 - 11 = 241.
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, Jeff now has 535 cards. To find out how many cards Jeff got from Nell, we can subtract the number of cards he already had (234) from the total number of cards he received (535). Therefore, Jeff received 301 additional cards from Nell.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 decks of cards initially.  If she gave some to Jeff, then she has fewer cards now than she did at first. So let's call the number of cards she has left x. Since she gave Jeff some cards, we can say that x - 4 = 415 (since she has 415 more cards than she did before). Also, since she gave him 10 cards, we know that x - 14 = 149 (since she has 149 fewer cards than she did before). Now we have two equations: x - 4 = 415 and x - 14 = 149. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 287. Therefore, Nell has 287 baseball cards left after giving some to Jeff. As for how many cards she has that are greater than 10, we can simply count the number of cards she has left: 287. So Nell has 287 baseball cards that are greater than 10.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 decks before she gave some of her cards to Jeff. So, after giving some of her cards to Jeff, Nell has 404 baseball cards in total (246 + 214 = 404). Now, we are asked how many more decks Nell has now than she had initially. Since each deck contains 10 cards, we can calculate this as follows: Number of additional decks = Total number of cards given to Jeff / Number of cards per deck = 495 (cards given to Jeff) / 10 = 49.5 decks. Therefore, Nell has an additional 49.5 decks of cards now.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards initially and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving them away, she has 210 cards left. So, we can write an equation:

Number of cards Nell gave to John = Number of cards she gave to Jeff + Number of cards she still has

We are given that Nell gave 195 cards to John. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the above equation:

195 = x + 210

Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 65

So, Nell gave 65 cards to Jeff."
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. So she had in total 438 + 18 x 10 = 624 cards. Now we are told that Jeff took some cards from her and now she has 55 + 178 = 233 cards left. Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nell has more than 10 is:  Number of cards Nell has more than 10 = Total number of cards - Number of cards Nell has left = 624 - 233 = 391 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card packs. So she had in total 239 + 38 x 10 = 547 cards. Now we are told that Jeff gave her some more cards, so she has 547 - 111 = 436 cards left. Therefore, Nell has 436 additional tens and 111 additional baseball cards.
Response:  If Paco had 35 kolačků to start with and he ate 19 of them, then he had 35 - 19 = 16 kolačků left at first.
Response:  If Paco had 28 sušenek and he ate some of them (pár), then he had less sušenek left. We can assume that he ate half of them (since we don't know how much he ate). So, if he ate half of 28 sušenek, then he had 14 sušenek left (28 / 2 = 14). Now, we are told that he had 7 sušenek left after eating some of them. Therefore, the number of sušenek Paco ate is equal to 7 - 14 = -7 sušenek. In other words, Paco did not eat any sušenek.
Response:  Paco had initially 40 suckers and he ate two. So, he has 40 - 2 = 38 suckers left. Then, he bought additional 37 suckers. So, his total number of suckers is now 38 + 37 = 75 suckers. Therefore, Paco has 75 - 2 = 73 suckers left.
Response:  Paco had 25 suckers and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 suckers left. Then, he bought 3 more suckers. So, now he has 20 + 3 = 23 suckers in total. Therefore, he still has 23 suckers left after eating 5 and buying 3 more.
Response:  Paco had 13 suckers and he ate two. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 suckers left. Then, he bought 36 more suckers. So, in total, he has 11 + 36 = 47 suckers. Therefore, the answer is 47.
Response:  Paco had 40 sundae sticks initially. He ate 5 of them, so he has 40 - 5 = 35 left. Then, he gave 13 to his friends, so he has 35 - 13 = 22 sundae sticks left. Therefore, Paco had 22 sundae sticks in total.
Response:  Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them. So, he has 17 - 14 = 3 remaining cookies. He gave 13 to his friends. Therefore, he gave away 13 - 3 = 10 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 12 sundries and he ate 16 of them. So, he gave his friend 21 more than he ate. Therefore, he gave his friend 21 - 16 = 5 more sundries than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had 22 sweet and 75 salty snacks in total. He ate 15 sweets and 54 salts. So, if he ate all the salty ones, then he would have 75 - 54 = 21 left. But we also know that he ate 15 of them, so now he has 21 / 15 = 1 left. Therefore, Paco had 1 sweet snack left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 9 sweet and 6 salty snacks initially. He ate 36 sweet and 3 salty snacks in total. So, if he ate 3 salty snacks, then he must have started with 6 salty snacks. Therefore, Paco had 6 salty snacks initially.
Response:  We know that Paco had 37 sweet and 11 salty snacks in total. He ate 5 sweet and 2 salty snacks. So, we can write this as an equation: 37 + 11 = 5 + 2. Now, let's solve for the number of sweet snacks he ate more than salty ones: 5 + 2 = x (where x is the number of sweet snacks). Therefore, Paco ate 3x more sweet snacks than salty ones.
Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet and 6 salty crackers initially. He ate 20 sweet crackers and 34 salty crackers. So, he has eaten in total 20 + 34 = 54 crackers. Since he started with 6 salty crackers, he must have eaten all of them. Therefore, the number of remaining salty crackers is 6. Similarly, since he ate 20 sweet crackers out of 8, there are now 8 - 20 = 6 sweet crackers left. So, the final number of sweet crackers is 6, and the number of salty crackers left is 6.
Response:  If Paco had 37 suckers and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 left. So, the number of suckers that Paco has left is 1.
Response:  Paco had 36 suckers and gave 14 to his friend. So he has 36 - 14 = 22 suckers left. Then, he ate 10 suckers, so now he has 22 - 10 = 12 suckers left. Therefore, Paco had 12 suckers at the end.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave away 9 to his friend. So he has 32 cookies left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 of them. Therefore, he has 32 - 18 = 14 cookies left.
Response:  Paco had 6 sundae sticks and gave 30 to his friend. So he has 6 - 30 = -24 sundae sticks left. Then, he ate 23 of them. So, he has -24 - 23 = -47 sundae sticks left. Therefore, he gave his friend more sundae sticks than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had 97 salty snacks and 34 sweet snacks in total. He ate 15 sweet snacks and 56 salty snacks. So, if he ate 15 sweet snacks, then he must have had X - 15 = 29 sweet snacks left. Since he ate 56 salty snacks, he must have had Y = 97 - 56 = 41 salty snacks left. Therefore, Paco had 29 + 41 = 60 sweet snacks left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 salty snacks and 17 sweet snacks in total. He ate 14 sweet snacks and 9 salty snacks. So, if he ate 9 salty snacks, then he must have had 17 - 9 = 8 salty snacks left initially. Therefore, Paco had 8 salty snacks initially.
Response:  We know that Paco had 39 sweet and 6 salty snacks in total. He ate 23 salty snacks and 32 sweet snacks. So, we can write an equation: 39 + 6 = 23 + 32 To solve for the number of sweet snacks eaten more than salty snacks, we need to subtract the number of salty snacks from the total number of snacks: 39 - 6 = 23 - 32 Therefore, Paco ate 15 more sweet snacks than salty snacks (32 - 23).
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 sweet and 25 salty crackers in total. He ate 28 salty and 15 sweet crackers. So, we have to find out how many more salty crackers he has left. To do this, we can subtract the number of salty crackers he ate from the initial amount of salty crackers he had:  Number of remaining salty crackers = Initial number of salty crackers - Number of salty crackers eaten  Number of remaining salty crackers = 25 - 28  Number of remaining salty crackers = -3  Therefore, there are 3 fewer salty crackers than sweet crackers.
Response:  If she received $7 and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $2 ($7 - $5 = $2).
Response:  If Gwen received $10 for her birthday and spent $8 of it, then she has $2 left ($10 - $8 = $2). So, Gwen received $10 and has $2 left.
Response:  Firstly, she received $2 from her mother as birthday gift. Then, her father gave her additional $4. So far, she has $6. Later, she spent $3, so she is left with $3. Therefore, the final amount of money she had was $3.
Response:  Firstly, Gwyneth received $8 from her mother and then her father gave her an additional $5. So far, she has $13. Later, she spent $4. Now we need to find out how much money Gwyneth got from her mother more than from her father. To do this, we subtract the amount she spent ($4) from the total amount of money she received ($13): $$ \therefore \text {Amount of money Gwyneth got from her mother more than from her father} = 13 - 4 = 9 $$ Therefore, Gwyneth got $9 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Mother gave her $3 and father gave her $6, so she received a total of $9 from them. She spent $4, so she has $9 - $4 = $5 left. Therefore, she received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwyneth received $5 from her father and then her mother gave her an additional $7. So far, she has $5 + $7 = $12. Next, we are told that she spent $4. Now, let's calculate how much money Gwyneth received from her mother more than what she got from her father: $$ \therefore \text {Money received from mother} = \text{Money received from father} + \text{Amount spent} $$ Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $$ \therefore \text {Money received from mother} = $12 + $4 = $16 $$ Therefore, Gwyneth received $16 more from her mother than she got from her father.
Response:  If Na got $5 from her father and her mother gave her $2, then she has a total of $7.  Now, if she spends $6, she will be left with $1. So, Na received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  If Josh had 9 marbles in his collection and lost some of them, then he has fewer marbles now. We can assume that he lost half of the marbles because it is easier to calculate this way. So, if he had 9 marbles initially, he must have lost 4.5 marbles (half of 9). Since we cannot have a fraction of a marble, let's round up to 4 marbles as the number he lost. Therefore, Josh currently has 4 marbles left in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had x kuliček in his collection and lost 21 of them, then he has x - 21 kuliček left. Since he now has 12 kuliček, we can set up an equation as follows:  x - 21 = 12. Solving for x, we get:  x = 33. So, Josh originally had 33 kuliček in his collection before losing any.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 marbles in his collection. Then he lost 11 marbles, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 marbles left. Finally, he found 5 new marbles, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 marbles in total. Therefore, Josh has 13 marbles in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had four marbles in his collection and lost 16 of them, then he had -16 = 4 remaining marbles.  If he found 8 new marbles, then he now has 4 + 8 = 12 marbles. So, he lost 16 - 12 = 4 marbles before finding any new ones.
Response:  If Josh had seven marbles in his collection and lost eight, then he had seven - 8 = 9 marbles left. Then, he found ten new marbles, so he now has 9 + 10 = 19 marbles. Therefore, the number of additional marbles that Josh found is 19 - 7 = 12 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left. So, Josh now has 14 marbles in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 20 marbles in his collection and gave two to Jack. So, he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left.
Response:  Josh had 22 marbles in his collection initially. Then, Jack gave him 20 more marbles. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 marbles in total.
Response:  If Josh had 19 marbles before and lost 11 of them, he has 8 marbles left now. So, he has 8 marbles in his collection now.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 marbles in his collection and then he found 13 more marbles. So, now he has 22 + 13 = 35 marbles. However, he lost 5 marbles, so he has 35 - 5 = 30 marbles left. Therefore, Josh currently has 30 marbles in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 marbles in his collection and he found 9 of them, then he lost 6 marbles (15 - 9 = 6). So, Josh lost 6 marbles before he found any.
"Response:  We know that Josh had three marbles in his collection initially and found six pebbles. To find out how many more marbles he found than those he lost, we need to subtract the number of marbles he lost (5) from the total number of pebbles he found (6):

Number of additional marbles = Number of pebbles found - Number of marbles lost = 6 - 5 = 1

So, Josh found one additional marble after losing five."
Response:  We know that Marco's jahody weigh 19 pounds and his father's jahody weigh 4 pounds. So, if we subtract the weight of his father's jahody from the weight of his own jahody, we get: 19 - 4 = 15 pounds. Therefore, Marco's jahody weigh 15 pounds more than his father's jahody.
Response:  We know that Marco's jahody weigh 13 pounds and his father's jahody weigh more than him. So, if we subtract 13 from the weight of his father's jahody, we will get the difference in weight between them. Therefore, the weight of his father's jahody is equal to 35 - 13 = 22 pounds.
Response:  We know that the total weight of jahod both father and son is equal to 37 pounds (liber). So, if father's jahody weigh 17 pounds, then his share would be 17/37 = 46% of the total weight. Now, we need to find out how much do Marcos jahody weigh. Since they together have 37 pounds of jahody, so Marcos jahody must weigh 37 - 17 = 20 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marco's jahody is 20 pounds or 9 kilograms.
Response:  We know that Marco's jahody weigh 8 pounds and his father's jahody weigh 32 pounds. So if they went together to collect jahodies, their total weight would be 8 + 32 = 40 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries (jahody in Czech). On their way back, Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, so he now has 3 pounds of strawberries left. To find out how much strawberries his father had, we can simply subtract the weight of strawberries that Marco lost from the total amount they collected: 24 - 9 = 15 pounds of strawberries must have been with his father.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco and his father together collected 36 pounds of jahods (liber). Then, while they were returning home, Marco's father lost 2 kilos of jahods. So now, Marco has 12 pounds of jahods left. To find out how much jahods are left with his father, we need to subtract the weight of jahods he lost from the total amount they collected initially. Therefore, the weight of jahods left with his father is: 36 - 2 = 34 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco and his father together collected 22 pounds of jahods (liber is an old unit of weight equal to 1/7 of a pound). Then, when they were returning home, Marco's father found additional 30 pounds of jahods. So, now the total amount of jahods collected by both of them is 22 + 30 = 52 pounds. Now, according to the question, Marco's jahods are 36 pounds more than those of his father. Therefore, the weight of jahods collected by Marco's father is 52 - 36 = 16 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather berries together.  The total weight of their berries is 37 pounds (liber).  Since Marco's berries weigh 15 pounds, then his father's berries must weigh 22 pounds (37 - 15 = 22).
Response:  If Marco and his father went to gather jahodies together, then their total weight of jahodies is equal to the sum of their individual weights of jahodies. So we can write an equation as follows:  Total weight = Individual weight + Individual weight  Substituting the given values in the above equation, we get:  Total weight = 30 libra + 17 libra  Equating both sides of the equation, we get: 47 libra  Therefore, Marco's jahodies weigh more than his father's jahodies by 47 - 17 = 30 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather jahodies together.  The jahodies gathered by Marco weighed 4 kilos. If their jahodies weigh together 26 libra, how much do the jahodies of his father weigh more than those of Marco?  To find out, let's divide 26 libra by 4 kilo, which gives us 6.5 kilograms (or 14.3 pounds). So, the jahodies of his father weigh more than those of Marco by 6.5 kilograms or 14.3 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather jahodies together. They gathered 4 kilos of jahodies from their garden. If we assume that each kilo of jahodies from Marco's father's garden weights 30 libra (which is equivalent to 1360 grams), then we can calculate how much does Marco's jahodies weight as follows:  Total weight of jahodies = Number of kilos x Weight per kilo  Total weight of jahodies = 4 kg x 30 libra/kg  Total weight of jahodies = 120 libra (or 507 grams) Therefore, Marco's jahodies weight approximately 120 libra or 507 grams.
"Response:  Before the stop, there were two children in the bus. When they got off, there were ten children in total. So, if we subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number, we get:  
Number of children left in the bus = Initial number - Number of children who got off  Number of children left in the bus = 2 - x  Where x is the number of children who got off. Since x = 8 (as given in the problem), we have:  
Number of children left in the bus = 2 - 8  Number of children left in the bus = -6  There are no negative numbers of children in the bus, so the correct answer is zero. Therefore, there are no more than two children in the bus after the stop."
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children in the bus. Then, at the bus stop, another 38 children got on the bus. So, now we have a total of 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that some children were already on the bus when it left (Nějaké dítě jeli autobusem.). Then, two more children got on at the stop (Další dva dítě nastoupily na zastávek.). So, the total number of children in the bus after the stop is:  41 - 2 = 39. Therefore, there were 39 children in the bus before the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus and they got off at a stop leaving behind 21 children. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children left behind.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of children who got off = 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that there were initially 41 children in the bus and after they got off at the stop, 18 children remained inside the bus. So, we can write an equation: 41 - 18 = x where 'x' represents the number of children who were already in the bus before reaching the stop. Now, we are given that x is greater than 0, which means that there must have been some children in the bus even before it picked up any more kids from the stop. Therefore, the correct answer is: x = 23.
Response:  We know that there were initially 21 children and then 10 got off at the bus stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Then, 4 more children boarded the bus, so now we have 11 + 4 = 15 children in the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got onto the bus at the bus stop is 15.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the bus and then 63 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 63 - 5 = 58. Now, we are told that 14 children remained inside the bus after everyone had gotten off. Therefore, the number of children who got onto the bus is 58 - 14 = 44.
Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children on the bus and then another 68 got off at the stop. So, in total, there are now 36 + 68 = 104 children on the bus. Then, some of them get off, leaving only 12 children behind. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to 104 - 12 = 92 children.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 22 + 40 = 62. Now, some of these children got off the bus, leaving only two children inside. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 62 - 2 = 60. Finally, we are told that some of these children vaulted over the side of the bus, so let's assume that 10 children vaulted over (this is just an assumption, as we don't have enough information to determine the exact number). In summary, the number of children who got off the bus at the stop is 60, and 10 children vaulted over the side of the bus.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 children boarded the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after they all got in is: 28 + 82 = 110 children. Now we are told that there were 30 children left in the bus. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who remained in the bus is: 30 - 110 = -80 children. Since it can't be negative, we have our answer: 80 children got off the bus more than those who stayed in it.
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children on the bus and then 4 more got off at the stop. So, the total number of children on the bus after they got off is:  23 - 4 = 19. Now we are told that some children got off the bus and others boarded it. But we don't know how many got off versus how many boarded. However, since there were 24 children who got off the bus, and 8 children who remained on the bus, we can conclude that:  19 - 8 = 11 children got on the bus. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the number of children who got on the bus is 11.
Response:  If Pekárna made 133 koláče and sold 51 of them, then there are 82 remaining koláče that were not sold (133 - 51 = 82). Now, if Baker made more koláče than he sold, then the number of koláče he made is greater than the number he sold. So, we can say that Baker made Xkoláče, where X is a positive integer. Since Baker sold 51 koláče, we know that X is greater than 51. But since Baker did not sell all of his koláče, we also know that X is less than or equal to 133. Therefore, the answer is X = 74.
Response:  If they made 54 Kolaches and some of them were sold, then the number of unsold Kolaches is equal to the total number of Kolaches minus the number of Kolaches sold. So we can write an equation as follows: Unsold Kolaches = Total Kolaches - Sold Kolaches. Now we are given that there are 13 Dorties left after selling some Kolaches. So we can substitute this value in our previous equation as follows:Unsold Kolaches = Total Kolaches - Sold Kolaches = 54 - x where x is the number of Kolaches sold.Now we know that x is a positive integer because they sold some Kolaches.So we can simplify the above equation as follows:Unsold Kolaches = 54 - xWhere x is a positive integer.Now we want to find out how many Kolaches were sold. So we need to solve for x.We can do this by subtracting 54 from both sides of the equation:x = 54 - Unsold KolachesSubstituting the value given in the question:x = 54 - 13 = 41So they sold 41 Kolaches.
"Response:  We know that the bakery sold 145 koláči and has 72 remaining. So, we can write an equation:

Sold = Remaining

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

145 = 72

Divide both sides of the equation by 72 to solve for Baker's output:

Baker's Output = Sold / Remaining
= 145 / 72
= 30

Therefore, Baker made 30 koláči."
Response:  If Pekárna made 155 Kolaches and his friend bought 140 Doughnuts, then he still has 15 - (140/2) = 7 Kolaches left.
Response:  The baker made 121 rolls and sold 105 of them. So he has 16 (121 - 105) rolls left. Then, he bought 170 new rolls. Therefore, the number of rolls the baker still has is 16 + 170 = 186 rolls.
Response:  We know that Pekárna made 13 doughnuts and sold 91 of them. So, they have 91 - 13 = 78 left. Then, we know that Baker bought 154 new doughnuts. So, the total number of doughnuts he has is 78 + 154 = 232. Therefore, Baker bought 232 - 91 = 141 additional doughnuts.
"Response: 
Pekárník made 170 rolls and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92).
He bought 31 new rolls, so now he has 92 + 31 = 123 rolls in total.
Now let's look at what happened to the baker. The question states that the baker sold more rolls than he bought. So if he sold x rolls, then he must have bought less than x rolls.
We know that the total number of rolls sold is 78 + x = 123, since the pekárník sold 78 and the baker sold x.
So we can set up an equation based on this information:
x = 123 - 78
Solving for x, we get:
x = 45
Therefore, the baker sold 45 rolls more than he bought."
Response:  The bakery made 110 kolaches and sold 75 of them. So, they have 35 remaining (110 - 75 = 35). Then, the baker made 76 more doughnuts. So, now they have 35 + 76 = 111 doughnuts in total. Therefore, the baker still needs to make 11 - 111 = 90 more doughnuts.
"Response: 
Pekárník made 144 goulashes and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 goulashes. So in total, he made 255 goulashes (144 + 111).  Now, let's find out how many more goulashes Baker made than he sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of goulashes he sold from the total number of goulashes he made: 255 - 71 = 184. Therefore, Baker made 184 more goulashes than he sold."
Response:  If Pekárník made 149 Kolaches and 91 Pečiva, then he has 239 baked goods in total (149 + 91 = 239).  If he sold 10 Doughnuts and 90 Pečiva, then he has 229 baked goods left (239 - 10 - 90 = 229).  Therefore, Baker needs to sell 9 more doughnuts to reach the same number as Pekárník had initially (229 - 9 = 219).
Response:  We know that Pekárna made 7 Kolaches and 148 Pečiva. If they sold 15 Doughnuts and 103 Pečiva, then we can calculate how many more Pečiva Baker needs to make. So, let's do it!  Number of Pečiva needed = Total number of Pečiva - Sold Pečiva = 148 - (15 + 103) = 148 - 128 = 20 Pečiva Therefore, Baker needs to make 20 more pieces of Pečiva.
"Response:  We know that Pekárník made 126 doughnuts and 48 pies. If he sold 115 doughnuts and 81 pies, then we can calculate how many more doughnuts than pies he sold as follows:

Difference = Sold doughnuts - Sold pies
= 115 - 81
= 34

So, Baker made 34 more doughnuts than pies."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the bakery made 19 Kolaches and 131 rolls. Secondly, when they sold 70 doughnuts and 88 breadrolls, they had more bread than doughnuts. So, if they have x bread rolls, then they must have less than x doughnuts. Thirdly, we can conclude that the number of bread rolls is greater than the number of doughnuts because there are more bread rolls than doughnuts. Finally, we can determine that the difference between the number of bread rolls and doughnuts is equal to the total number of bread rolls minus the total number of doughnuts. Therefore, the answer is (131-70) = 61.
"Response:  We know that Pekárník made 157 doughnuts and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 doughnuts and 147 pastries, then we can calculate how many doughnuts Baker sold as follows:

Doughnuts sold by Baker = Doughnuts sold by Pekárník - Doughnuts sold by Pekárník
= 158 - 157
= 1

Therefore, Baker sold one doughnut."
Response:  We know that Pekárník made 54 Kolaches and 143 Pečiva in total. If he sold 68 Kolaches and 92 Pečiva, then we can calculate how many more Pečiva he sold as follows: Number of additional Pečiva = Total number of Pečiva - Sold Pečiva = 143 - (68 + 92) = 143 - 150 = -7 Pečiva Therefore, Baker sold 7 additional pieces of Pečiva.
"Response:  If he sold 44 colachis and would have made 48 more, then we can calculate how many he still has left as follows:

Total number of colachis = Number of colachis sold + Number of colachis to be made
= 44 + 48
= 92

So, Pekarник still has 92 colachis left."
Response:  If Pekárník sold 8 colaacs and then made 40 more, that means he had 48 colaacs in total (8 + 40 = 48). So, if Baker sold x colaacs before Pekarnik, then the total number of colaacs sold by both of them is 48 + x = 56. Therefore, Baker sold 8 additional colaacs (x = 56 - 48 = 8).
Response:  If his friend bought 137 colaacs and he would have made 169 more, then we need to find out how many colaacs he had initially. So, let X be the number of colaacs he had initially. Then, we know that the total number of colaacs he has is equal to the number of colaacs his friend bought plus the number of colaacs he made: X + 137 = 169. Solving for X, we get X = 206. Therefore, he still has 206 colaacs.
Response:  We know that the bakery made 173 goulashes and sold 86 of them. If they sold all the goulashes they made, then they have 173 - 86 = 87 goulashes left. Now we need to subtract the number of new doughnuts (103) from the total number of goulashes left: 87 - 103 = -15. So, the baker has -15 goulashes left.
Response:  We know that Pekárník made 99 colaches and bought 167 new ones. He sold 89 of them. So, he had 78 (99 - 89) unsolved colaches left after selling some. Now, we know that Baker bought additional 9 colaches before selling any. Therefore, the number of colaches Baker bought is equal to the number of colaches Pekárník had left minus the number of colaches he sold: 9 = 78 - x, where x is the number of colaches Baker bought. Solving for x, we get x = 30. So, Baker bought 30 more colaches before selling any.
Response:  The baker made 8 colačů and sold 145 dentures. Therefore, he bought 139 new doughnuts and sold more than he bought. So, the difference between the number of doughnuts he bought and sold is equal to the number of doughnuts he sold minus the number he bought. In other words, we can write this as follows: Number of doughnuts sold = Number of doughnuts bought + Difference between the two numbers. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of doughnuts sold = 8 + (139 - 145) = -6. Therefore, the baker sold 6 fewer doughnuts than he bought.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the bakery made 62 colaacs initially and then produced additional 149 colaacs. So, in total, they produced 62 + 149 = 211 colaacs. Now, we are told that the baker sold 144 of these colaacs. Therefore, the number of colaacs left with the baker is 211 - 144 = 67 colaacs.
"Response: 
Pekárník made 81 buns and then made another 92 doughnuts. He sold 46 of them. So, he must have made more doughnuts than he sold. In other words, he had some left over after selling 46 of them. Therefore, the number of doughnuts that Baker made is greater than 46."
Response:  If Pekárník made 61 pies and 167 doughnuts, then he sold x doughnuts and y pie(s). We know that if he sells 108 doughnuts, he will have 108 - 167 = -59 doughnuts left. Similarly, if he sells 44 pies, he will have 44 - 61 = -17 pies left. So, Baker has to sell 17 + 59 = 76 doughnuts and 44 pies.
"Response:  If Pekárník made 56 pieces of bread and 124 dumplings, then he has altogether x pieces of bread and dumplings.  If he sold 104 dumplings and 29 pieces of bread, then he still has x - 104 dumplings and x - 29 bread. Since he wants to sell all his products, we can write:
x = 104 + 29 = 133
So, Baker needs 133 more pieces of bread."
Response:  We know that Pekárník made 52 pieces of bread and 84 rolls. If he sold 102 doughnuts and 94 pieces of bread, then he must have sold more doughnuts than bread. So, the number of doughnuts sold is greater than the number of bread pieces sold. Therefore, Baker made more doughnuts than pekařnik did.
Response:  We know that the bakery made 134 bread rolls and 11 strudels. If they sold 140 danishes and 92 bread rolls, we can calculate how many more bread rolls were produced than danishes as follows: Number of bread rolls produced = 134 + 11 = 145 Number of danishes sold = 140 Therefore, the bakery produced 15 more bread rolls than danises.
Response:  We know that Pekárna made 14 doughnuts and 153 pastries. If they sold 8 pastries and 97 doughnuts, then we can calculate how many doughnuts were sold as follows: Number of doughnuts sold = Total number of doughnuts - Number of doughnuts sold = 153 - 97 = 56 doughnuts Therefore, Baker sold 56 doughnuts.
Response:  We know that the baker sold 154 pieces of bread and 78 Kolaches.  If he made 114 peppers and 43 rolls, then he must have had some left over to sell. So let's subtract the number of rolls he sold from the total number of items he made: 114 - 78 = 36. Therefore, the baker sold an additional 36 peppers.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games from Nintendo and she wants to have 140 games in total, then we need to find out how many more games she needs to buy. We can do this by subtracting the number of games she already has (22) from the desired total number of games (140):

Number of additional games = 140 - 22 = 118
So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games from Nintendo to reach her goal of having 140 games in total."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games for Nintendo and she gives away 64 matches, then she will have left with how many games? So, the answer is 42 (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  At first, Kelly had 91 games from Nintendo. If she has 92 matches left, it means that she started with more than 91 games. So, initially, Kelly had 91 + x games, where x is the number of games she had at the beginning. Since she distributed 91 games to someone else, we can write the equation: 91 = x - 92. Solving for x, we get: x = 93. Therefore, Kelly initially had 93 games from Nintendo.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away, we need to subtract the number of Nintendo games she already has (20) from the total number of games she has (90). So, Kelly needs to give away 70 - 20 = 50 more games.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and 132 games from Sony. To find out how many games she needs to give away from Sony to have 31 games left, we can subtract the number of games she has from Sony (132) from the total number of games she wants to have (31). So, Kelly needs to give away 100 games from Sony to have 31 games left.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games from Nintendo and found 31 more games for Nintendo, then she now has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games from Nintendo. To find out how many games are left for Kelly to play, we need to divide the number of games she has played (111) by the number of games she wants to play (6). So, Kelly has 111 / 6 = 18 remaining games to play.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 52 blocks to build his tower so far and he has 38 blocks left. To find out how many blocks Randy had at the beginning, we can use the following equation: Number of blocks at the beginning = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used So, in this case: Number of blocks at the beginning = 52 - 38 = 14 blocks. Therefore, Randy had 14 blocks at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he is using some of them to build a tower. If there are 72 blocks left after building the tower, then we can say that Randy used x blocks to build the tower, where x is the number of blocks left after building the tower. So, we have the equation: 97 - x = 72. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 97: x = 72 / 97. Therefore, Randy used 15 blocks (72 / 97) to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total. He uses 14 blocks to build the tower and 11 blocks to build the house. So, we subtract these amounts from his total number of blocks: 79 - 14 = 65 blocks left for other things (e.g., building more houses or towers). Therefore, there are 65 blocks remaining after Randy builds the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total and he used 27 blocks to build the tower. So, the number of blocks left for building the house is 53 - 27 = 26 blocks. Therefore, Randy used 26 blocks to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks and he used 33 blocks to build the tower and 13 blocks to build the house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of blocks used for the tower = 33  Number of blocks used for the house = 13  Now, let's solve for the difference between the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for the house:  Difference = Number of blocks used for the tower - Number of blocks used for the house  Difference = 33 - 13  Difference = 20  Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks in total and he used 79 blocks to build the tower and 82 blocks to build the house. So, we can write an equation as follows: Blocks used for the tower = 79 Blocks used for the house = 82 - 79 = 3 Now, we want to find out how many blocks Randy used to build the house more than he did for the tower. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: Number of blocks used for the house more than the tower = 82 - 79 = 3 Therefore, Randy used 3 blocks more to build the house than he did for the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 36 blocks to build the tower so far and he had 59 blocks in total. To find out how many blocks are left, we can subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks:  Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used  In this case, the number of blocks used is 36, and the total number of blocks is 59, so:  Number of blocks remaining = 59 - 36 = 23 blocks  Therefore, Randy has 23 blocks left to use for building the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks and he used 20 blocks to build the house. So, the number of blocks left is: 95 - 20 = 75 blocks. Now we are asked how many blocks Randy used to build the tower more than he used for the house. This means that if he built the tower using x blocks, then he used more than 20 blocks (the amount he used for the house). Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for the house is: x - 20 =?. Solving for x, we get: x = 55 blocks. So, Randy used 55 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks in total and he used 89 blocks to build the house. So, we can say that he has 1 block left over from building the house. Now, let's find out how many blocks he used for the tower. He used 63 blocks to build the tower, which is less than the number of blocks he had left after building the house. Therefore, Randy used more blocks to build the house than he did for the tower. The difference between the number of blocks used for the house and the number of blocks used for the tower is equal to the number of blocks Randy had left over after building the house. In other words, if we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks Randy had left over, we get the number of blocks Randy used to build the house. So, the answer is:  Number of blocks used to build the house = Number of blocks left over - Number of blocks used for the tower.
"Response:  If you have read 20 different books in the series ""Crazy Stupid School"", and you have not yet read 5 of them, then you must have already read at least 15 books from that series. Therefore, the number of books you have read from that series is 15."
"Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the series ""Crazy Stupid School"" and we have read 8 of them. So, the number of books left to read is:

13 - 8 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 books remaining in the series ""Crazy Stupid School""."
"Response:  We know that you have already read 12 books and watched 56 movies in the series ""Crazy Stupid Love School"". To find out how many more books you need to read, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books already read So, in this case, the total number of books is 22 (as given in the question), and you have already read 12 books, so the number of remaining books is: Number of remaining books = 22 - 12 = 10 Therefore, you still need to read 10 more books from the series."
Response:  We know that there are 4 books in the series and we have already watched 7 films. So, to find out how many more films we need to watch, we can subtract the number of films we have already watched from the total number of films. In this case, that would be:  Number of films left to watch = Total number of films - Number of films watched = 17 - 7 = 10 Therefore, we still need to watch 10 more films from the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"". When we read 19 books and watched 13 films, we can see that there are more books than films in the series. Specifically, there are 5 more books (19 - 14 = 5) than films (13). Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"". When we read 19 books and watched 61 movies, how many more movies are there than books in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School""?  Therefore, the answer is 42 (61 - 8 = 53, and 53 / 8 = 6.875, so rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 7)."
"Response:  If we have 10 books and 11 movies in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"", then we can conclude that for each book there are 11 movies.  Therefore, if we have read 13 books, it means that we have watched fewer movies than the number of books we have read. So, the answer is: We have read more books than movies."
"Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 21 movies in the series ""Crazy Stupid Love School"", then you have watched more movies than books. So, the number of movies you have watched is greater than the number of books you have read. To be precise, you have watched 21 movies and read 7 books. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies you have watched and the number of books you have read is 21 - 7 = 14 movies."
"Response:  If you have read 8 books from the series ""Crazy Stupid Love School"", and there are a total of 14 different books in the series, then we can calculate that you still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
"Response:  We know that you have already read 4 books and watched 34 movies in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"". To find out how many more books you need to read, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books already read Total number of books = 62 (books) - 4 (books already read) = 58 Therefore, you still need to read 58 additional books from the series."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"". If we have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then we still need to watch 3 more movies (8 - 4 = 3)."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 different films and 15 different books in the series ""Crazy Stupid Love School"". When we read 11 books and watched 40 movies, how many more books are there in the series than movies?  To find out, let's divide the number of books (15) by the number of movies (40): 15 / 40 = 3.75. So, there are approximately 3.75 more books in the series than movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"". When we read 13 books and watched 63 movies, how many more movies are there than books in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School""?  To find out, let's divide the number of movies (63) by the number of books (13): 63 / 13 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 more movies than books in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School""."
"Response:  We know that we have read 10 books and watched 6 movies in the series "" Crazy Stupid Love School"". If you have read 14 books and watched 19 movies, then you have read more books than movies. So, the number of books you have read is greater than the number of movies you have watched. To find out how many more books you have read, let's subtract the number of movies from the number of books:  Number of books - Number of movies = More books read  In this case, the difference between the number of books and movies is 8 (10 - 6). Therefore, you have read 8 more books than movies in the series ""Crazy Stupid Love School."""
"Response:  We know that we have read 19 films and seen 16 books in the series ""Crazy Stupid Love School"". So, if we have read more movies than books, it means that we have watched more movies than books. Therefore, the number of movies we have watched is greater than the number of books we have read. To be precise, we have watched 19 movies and read 16 books, so the difference between the two numbers is 3 (19 - 16). Therefore, we have watched 3 more movies than books."
Response:  If Dave won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 3 tickets for that purpose (since 7 - 3 = 4 remaining tickets). So, if he used 3 tickets to buy toys, then he has 4 remaining tickets.
"Response:  We know that Dave won some number of tickets (let's call it x). Then he used 12 tickets to buy toys. So, we have:
x - 12 = 14
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 14 + 12
x = 26
So, Dave won 26 tickets in the game!"
Response:  If Dave won 18 tickets and used 5 for toys, he has 13 left (18 - 5 = 13). Then, if he spent 11 of those remaining tickets on clothes, he has 2 left (13 - 11 = 2). So, Dave had 2 tickets left after buying clothes.
Response:  If Dave won 19 tickets and used 12 for toys and 7 for clothes, then he had 19 - (12 + 7) = 10 remaining tickets left after buying both items. So, Dave used 10 more tickets for toys than for clothes.
Response:  If Dave won 13 tickets and used 8 of them to buy toys, then he has 5 remaining tickets (13 - 8 = 5). Now, if he used 18 more tickets for clothes than for toys, that means he spent 18 / 2 = 9 tickets on clothes. So, Dave used 9 + 5 = 14 tickets in total before running out.
Response:  We know that Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets. If he used 10 tickets to buy a toy, then he had 14 - 10 = 4 remaining tickets left. So, Dave had 4 tickets left after using 10 tickets to buy a toy.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 14 trees and after the hurricane, she found out that 9 of them survived. So, we have to find out how many trees did not survive (died) in the hurricane. To do this, we need to subtract the number of surviving trees from the total number of trees planted. Therefore, the answer is: Number of trees that died = Total number of trees - Number of surviving trees = 14 - 9 = 5.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees and after the hurricane, 6 of them survived. So, we can calculate the number of trees that did not survive as follows: Number of trees that did not survive = Total number of trees - Number of trees that survived = 13 - 6 = 7 trees. Therefore, 7 trees did not survive the hurricane.
Response:  We know that Haley vypěstovala 20 trees on her yard before the hurricane hit. After the hurricane, 4 of those trees were left standing. So, we can say that 16 trees died during the hurricane (20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, the answer is 16.
"Response:  We know that after the hurricane (tornado) passed through, there were only 12 trees left. So initially, there must have been more than 12 trees growing in the garden. Now we need to find out how many trees grew before the hurricane hit. According to the passage, ""Haley planted 30 trees in her backyard."" Therefore, before the hurricane hit, there were 30 trees in total in Haley's backyard. Subtracting the number of trees remaining after the hurricane (12), we get the total number of trees that grew: 30 - 12 = 18. So, 18 trees grew in Haley's backyard before the hurricane hit."
Response:  We know that Haley had already planted 9 trees before the hurricane hit. After the hurricane, she planted additional 5 trees. So, in total, Haley has 9 + 5 = 14 trees left to grow.
"Response:  If two trees died in Haley's garden after a hurricane and she originally had 12 trees, then we can calculate how many trees are left as follows:

Number of trees remaining = Original number of trees - Number of dead trees
= 12 - 2
= 10

Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in her garden."
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 trees that survived the typhoon and 10 more trees died in the typhoon. So, the total number of trees = 3 + 10 = 13. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  We know that initially there were 11 trees in Haley's garden and two of them died during the hurricane. So, the number of surviving trees is equal to 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, 9 additional trees survived the hurricane.
Response:  If they are picking 66 pails of oranges per day and each pail contains 28 oranges, then...  So, they are picking 66 x 28 = 1804 oranges per day.
Response:  If they are consuming 8 pytlů (pomeranches) per day and we want to collect 24 pytlů in total, then we need to calculate how many days it will take to collect that amount of pomeranches. We can do this by dividing the total number of pytlů we want to collect by the daily consumption rate:  Number of days = Total number of pytlů / Daily consumption rate = 24 pytlů / 8 pytlů/day = 3 days So, it will take them 3 days to collect 24 pytlů of pomeranches.
"Response:  If the picking will continue for another 4 days and they have already picked 56 pytles of oranges today, then we can calculate how many pytles they will pick each day as follows:

Number of pytles per day = Total number of pytles / Number of days left to pick
= 56 / 4
= 14 pytles per day
Therefore, they will pick 14 pytles of oranges each day for the next 4 days."
Response:  If they are harvesting 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 oranges, then in one day they will have collected 1504 oranges (38 x 42 = 1504). Now, if it takes 49 days for the entire harvest to be collected, then the total number of oranges collected during that time will be 76,360 oranges (1504 x 49 = 76,360).
Response:  If they are harvesting 66 pails per day and each pail contains 25 oranges, then in one day they will have collected 66 x 25 = 1600 oranges.  Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1600 x 87 = 136,400 oranges.
"Response:  If they pick 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges are picked in total as follows:

Number of oranges picked per day = Number of baskets picked per day x Number of oranges in each basket
= 8 x 35
= 280 oranges per day

Therefore, they pick 280 oranges per day."
"Response:  If they are harvesting 16 pails of oranges per day and each pail contains 57 oranges, then the total number of oranges harvested per day is:

16 pails/day x 57 oranges/pail = 909 oranges/day

Now, to find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 pails of oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges harvested per day:

80 pails / 909 oranges/day = 8.84 days

Therefore, it will take approximately 8.84 days to harvest 80 pails of oranges."
Response:  If they skizzle 67 pytles per day and each pytle contains 12 pomerances, then they sklizzle in total 67 x 12 = 804 pomeranzes per day.  So if they sklizzle 35 pytles of pomeranzes, they will sklizzle 35 x 12 = 420 pomeranzes.
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 51 x 74 = 3690 pytlů of oranges. Since they throw away 71 pytlů per day, after 51 days there will be 3690 - 71 = 3629 pytlů of oranges left for further processing.
Response:  If they are picking 76 pails of oranges per day and throwing away 64 of them, then the number of oranges picked is equal to 76 - 64 = 12. So, they pick 12 pails of oranges per day. Since each pail contains 50 oranges, they pick 12 x 50 = 600 oranges per day.
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, there will be 28 x 26 = 704 pytlů of ripe oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 pytlů of unripe oranges. So, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 pytlů of oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 82 = 2050 pytlů of ripe oranges.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 31 x 45 = 1365 pytlů of ripe oranges and 24 x 45 = 1080 pytlů of unripe oranges. So, after 45 days, there will be 1080 - 1365 = -305 pytlů of unripe oranges.
"Response:  We know that in total, they pick 69 pytlů of oranges per day (44 + 25). So, we can write an equation:

Total number of orange pytlů = Number of zralý pytlů + Number of nezralý pytlů

Now, let's solve for the number of zralé pytlů:

Number of zralé pytlů = Total number of orange pytlů - Number of nezralé pytlů
= 69 - 25
= 44

So, every day they pick more than twice as many zralé pytlů as nezralé pytlů."
Response:  We know that in total, they pick 12 pytlů (5 + 74) of oranges per day. So if they pick more unripe than ripe oranges, then the number of unripe oranges picked is greater than 12. Therefore, we can say that they pick 13 - 12 = 1 more unit of unripe oranges than ripe ones per day.
Response:  If they collected 54 baskets of oranges in total and collected 18 baskets per day, then it took them _____ days to collect all those oranges.  Solution: 54 / 18 = 3 days
"Response:  If they picked up 56 baskets of oranges in one day, and they picked them up for 14 days in total, then we can calculate how many baskets they picked up per day as follows:

Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days
= 56 / 14
= 4

So, they picked up 4 baskets of oranges per day."
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 73 = 1825 unripe pomegranates and 5 x 73 = 365 ripe pomegranates. So, after 73 days, they will have a total of 1825 + 365 = 2190 pomegranates.
"Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, if they are able to collect 65 pytlů nezralych pomerancich per day, then after 6 days they will have collected:

65 x 6 = 390 pytlů nezralych pomerancich

So, there will be 390 pytlů nezralych pomerancich left after 6 days of harvesting."
"Response:  We know that daily they pick 86 pytlů of ripe oranges and 41 pytlů of unripe oranges. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of pytlů of ripe oranges picked = 86
Number of pytlů of unripe oranges picked = 41

Now, we want to find out how many more pytlů of ripe oranges are picked than unripe oranges. To do this, we subtract the number of pytlů of unripe oranges from the number of pytlů of ripe oranges:

Difference between number of pytlů of ripe oranges and unripe oranges = 86 - 41 = 45

So, there are 45 more pytlů of ripe oranges picked than unripe oranges."
Response:  If he is picking up 71 pits of unripe oranges and 60 pits of ripe oranges every day, then the number of pits of unripe oranges picked up daily must be greater than the number of pits of ripe oranges picked up daily. So we can say that the difference between the number of pits of unripe oranges picked up daily and the number of pits of ripe oranges picked up daily is positive.  Therefore, the answer to the question is:  More than 71 - 60 = 11.
Response:  The length of Jesseho's room is 12 steps long and its width is 11 steps wide. To find out how big her room is, we need to multiply the length and width. So, the area of Jesseho's room is: Area = Length x Width = 12 x 11 = 132 square steps. Now, let's compare the area with the dimensions given in the question: Area = 132 square steps > 12 step length > 11 step width. Therefore, Jesseho's room is longer than it is wide.
Response:  The length of the room is given as 2 meters (or 200 cm). To find out how wide the room needs to be for the bathtub to fit in it, we need to divide the length of the room by the width of the bathtub. So if the bathtub has a width of 14 square feet (which is equal to 14 x 30 = 420 cm), then we can calculate the width of the room as follows: Room length / Bathtub width = 2 m / 420 cm = 5 cm. Therefore, the width of the room needed for the bathtub is approximately 5 cm or 0.05 meters.
Response:  The width of Jesseho's room is given as $2$ meters. We are asked to find the length of her room. Since the room is rectangular in shape, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. So, if the length of Jesseho's room is $L$, then the area of her room is given by: Area = $L \times 2$ meters. Now, we are told that the volume of the koberec (a small container) is $14$ square meters. This means that the height of the koberec is also $14$ meters. Therefore, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = Length x Width x Height. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Volume = $(L \times 2)$ meters $\times 14$ meters $\times$ Height =? meters^3. To solve for the height, we need to divide both sides of the equation by $14$. So, we have: Height = Volume / ($14$ meters). Now, we are given that the volume of the koberec is $14$ square meters. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the previous equation and solve for the height: Height = $(L \times 2)$ meters / $14$ meters =? meters. Simplifying, we get: Height = $L/7$ meters. Thus, the length of Jesseho's room is $L = 7$ meters.
Response:  The length of the room is 3 meters and its width is also 3 meters. Therefore, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 3 x 3 = 9 square meters. Now we know that the carpet covers 16 square meters. To find out how many pieces of carpet are needed to cover the entire floor, we divide the area of the room by the area covered by each piece of carpet: Number of pieces of carpet = Room area / Carpet area = 9 / 16 = 5/2 or 2.5 pieces of carpet. So, Jessie needs 2.5 pieces of carpet to cover the entire floor.
"Response:  We know that the room is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. To find out how many tiles we need to cover the entire floor, we can divide the length of the room by the length of each tile (which is 4 square feet). So, we have:
Length of room = 20 feet = 6 \* 4 = 24 tiles
Since the width of the room is also given as 12 feet, we can repeat this process for the width:
Width of room = 12 feet = 4 \* 4 = 16 tiles
Therefore, we will need 24 + 16 = 40 tiles to cover the entire floor of the room."
Response:  We know that there are 20 rooms in total and each room needs 36 square feet of carpet (as given in the problem). So, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet we need for all 20 rooms together. To do this, we can multiply the length and width of each room as follows: Length x Width = Area of one Room 19 x 18 = 342 Square Feet Now, we have to add up the area of all 20 rooms to get the total area of carpet needed: Total Area = Sum of Areas of All Rooms 342 + 342 +... + 342 = Total Area In this case, the total area of carpet needed is 342 x 20 = 6,840 Square Feet Therefore, Jessie will need 6,840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all 20 rooms.
Response:  The length of the room is given as 6 meters (m). Since the width of the room is also given as 6 m, we know that the length of the room is greater than its width. Therefore, the area of the room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 6 m x 6 m = 36 m^2 Now, according to the question, Jessie's bedroom is larger than 36 m^2. So, the size of her bedroom must be more than 36 m^2.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a carpet with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 5 feet long, we can find out how wide it is by dividing its length by 2 (since width and length are perpendicular). So, the width of her room is 5 feet / 2 = 2.5 feet. Therefore, the width of her room is 2.5 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a carpet with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since we are given that the room is 2 feet wide, we can find its length as follows: Length = Area / Width = 10 sq ft / 2 ft = 5 ft So, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square stops of carpet and her room is 4 steps long and 20 steps wide. To find out how many squares of carpet she needs for the entire floor, we can use the formula Area = Length x Width. So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Area = 4 x 20 = 80 square stops. Since there are 18 square stops of carpet, we need 80/18 = 4.44... squares of carpet to cover the entire floor. Therefore, Jesse needs approximately 4.44 squares of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that Razorback makes $23 per sold t-shirt and they made $230 during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of t-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per t-shirt. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of t-shirts = $230 / $23 = 10 t-shirts. Therefore, they sold 10 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that the skate shop sold $51 worth of tri-cotton shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Since each tri-cotton shirt costs $20, we can calculate the number of shirts sold as follows: Number of shirts = Total revenue / Price per shirt So, the number of tri-cotton shirts sold is: Number of shirts = $51 / $20 = 2 6 Therefore, each tri-cotton shirt costs $20.
Response:  We know that the skate shop earned $87 per sold t-shirt and they sold 95 t-shirts in total during both games. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then they earned $403 ($87 x 47) from those sales alone.
Response:  We know that the skate shop earned $106 per sold t-shirt and they sold 242 t-shirts in total during both games. So, if they sold 115 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then they must have sold 127 t-shirts during the game in Texas (242 - 115 = 127).
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $98 per t-shirt and they sold 163 t-shirts in total during both games in Arkansas and Texas. So, if they sold 89 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then the amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas can be calculated as follows: Total amount of money earned = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 89 t-shirts x $98 per t-shirt = $8,572 Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $8,572 from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas.
Response:  We know that in total they sold 186 tricks during both games and each tricker cost $78. So we can calculate how many trickers were sold in arkansa as follows: Total number of trickers sold = Number of trickers sold in Arkansas + Number of trickers sold in Texas Total number of trickers sold = 186 - 172 = 14 Therefore, the number of trickers sold in Texas is equal to 14. Now we need to find out how much money was made from selling trickers in Texas. To do this, we multiply the number of trickers sold in Texas by the price per tricker: Money made from selling trickers in Texas = Number of trickers sold in Texas x Price per tricker Money made from selling trickers in Texas = 14 x $78 = $1092 So the amount of money made from selling trickers in Texas is $1092.
Response:  We know that each tri-shirt costs $62 and each jersey costs $99. So if they sold 183 tri-shirts and 31 jerseys, their total revenue would be:  Revenue = Number of tri-shirts x Price per tri-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price per jersey  Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99  Revenue = $11,543 + $2,799  Revenue = $14,342  Therefore, the Razorbacks made $14,342 in profit from selling tri-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that each dres sold for $165 and each trizek sold for $67. So if they sold 156 dreses, they made $156 x $165 = $25,390 in revenue from those sales. If they sold 74 trizeks, they made $74 x $67 = $4,898 in revenue from those sales. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from these sales is $25,390 + $4,898 = $30,288.
"Response:  We know that each tri-shirt costs $ 192 and each jersey costs $ 34. So if they sold 157 tri-shirts and 19 jerseys, then their total revenue from these items would be:

Tri-shirts: 157 x $ 192 = $ 28,604
Jerseys: 19 x $ 34 = $ 656
Total revenue: $ 28,604 + $ 656 = $ 29,260
Now we need to find out how much does a tri-shirt cost more than a jersey. To do this, we can subtract the price of a jersey from the price of a tri-shirt:
$ 29,260 - $ 656 = $ 28,604
So, a tri-shirt costs $ 28,604 - $ 656 = $ 27,948 more than a jersey."
Response:  We know that from each shirt (tri-chek) they sell $86 and from each jersey (dress) they sell $232. So if they sold x tri-cheks and y dresses, then their total revenue would be: Total Revenue = Number of Tri-Cheeks \* Price per Tri-Cheek + Number of Dresses \* Price per Dress  Now we are given that they sold 254 tri-cheks and 43 dresses. So we can plug these values into the equation above to solve for y: Number of Tri-Checks = 254 Total Revenue = Number of Tri-Checks \* Price per Tri-Check + Number of Dresses \* Price per Dress Substituting the values we know: Number of Tri-Checks = 254 Total Revenue = ($86 x 254) + ($232 x 43) Solving for y: $86 x 254 = $21,970 $232 x 43 = $9,666 Therefore, the value of y is $9,666.
"Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold is given as 130. If they were sold at $51 each, then the total revenue from t-shirt sales would be:

Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt
= 130 x $51
= $6,430

Now, we are told that there was a discount of $8 per t-shirt during the game. So, the price per t-shirt after the discount is:

Price per t-shirt (after discount) = Original price per t-shirt - Discount amount
= $51 - $8
= $43

So, the total revenue from t-shirt sales after applying the discount is:

Total revenue (after discount) = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt (after discount)
= 130 x $43
= $5,470

Therefore, the profit made from selling t-shirts is:

Profit = Total revenue (after discount) - Cost of t-shirts
= $5,470 -?

We don't know the cost of the t-shirts, so we can't calculate the exact profit. However, based on the information provided, we can estimate the profit to be around $920 ($5,470 - $4,550)."
Response:  We know that the original price of the Razorback t-shirts is $201. During the game, they increased the price to $418 and sold 14 t-shirts. So, we can calculate the total amount earned from selling t-shirts as follows: Total Amount = Number of T-Shirts x Original Price + Number of T-Shirts x Increased Price Total Amount = 14 x $201 + 14 x $418 Total Amount = $3,596 + $5,864 Total Amount = $9,460 Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $9,460 from selling t-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that they sold $60 worth of merchandise during the game. If they made $10 profit from each shirt, then the number of shirts sold is equal to the amount of money earned divided by the profit per shirt. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 shirts. Therefore, they sold 6 shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that during the game, $215 was made from selling 5 t-shirts. So, each t-shirt must have cost at least $43 (215 / 5 = 43).
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt sold, Razorback makes $215 and for each jersey sold they make $5. So if they sell x t-shirts, they will make $215x dollars and if they sell y jerseys, they will make $5y dollars. Now we are given that they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jerseys during the game. To find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts, we can set up the equation: $215x = 20(5) where x is the number of t-shirts sold. Solving for x, we get x=4. Therefore, Razorback made $850 from selling t-shirts ($215x). Similarly, to find out how much money they made from selling jerseys, we can set up the equation: $5y = 64. Solving for y, we get y=13. Therefore, Razorback made $790 from selling jerseys ($5y). In total, they made $850 + $790 = $1640 in revenue from selling both t-shirts and jerseys during the game.
Response:  We know that for each shirt sold, Razorback makes $204 and for each jersey sold they make $76. So if they sell x shirts, they will make $x \* $204 = y dollars in total. Similarly, if they sell z jerseys, they will make $z \* $76 = w dollars in total. Now we are given that they sold 158 shirts and 2 jerseys. Therefore, the total amount of money made from selling these items is equal to y + w = (158 \* $204) + (2 \* $76) = 39,680 + 152 = 40,832 dollars.
Response:  We know that from each shirt sold, Razorback makes $240 and from each jersey sold they make $210. So if we add up how much money they made from both shirts and jerseys during the game, we get: Shirts: 177 x $240 = $43,800 Jerseys: 23 x $210 = $4930 Total: $43,800 + $4930 = $48,730 Now we are told that Razorback made $48,730 from selling shirts and jerseys during the game. Since they sold 177 trips and 23 jerseys, we can calculate the total amount of money they made from each item as follows: Trips: 177 x $240 = $43,680 Jerseys: 23 x $210 = $4930 Total: $43,680 + $4930 = $48,610 Therefore, a tripe costs more than a jersey by $48,610 - $48,730 = $920.
Response:  We know that from each shirt sold, Razorback makes $25 and from each hat sold, they make $115. So, if we add up how much money they made from both shirts and hats, we get: Shirts: 113 x $25 = $2725 Hats: 78 x $115 = $9075 Total: $2725 + $9075 = $11800 Therefore, the difference between the price of a dres and a triček is $11800 - $78 = $11722.
Response:  If there are 5 tables and each table has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. Now, we need to find out how many more chairs than tables there are. So, if there are 5 tables, then there are 5 - 1 = 4 more chairs than tables. Therefore, there are 4 extra chairs.
Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables and each set has the same number of chairs. So, if there are x chairs in total, then there must be x/2 chairs in each set. Since there are 12 chairs in total, we can write an equation: x = 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore, each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  If there are 9 chairs in the garden and each table has 3 chairs, then the number of tables is 9 / 3 = 3. So, there are 3 tables.
Response:  If there are 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 11 x 13 = 133 chairs. Therefore, there are 133 chairs at the party.
Response:  If there are 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  If 11 people sit at the tables, then the number of unoccupied chairs will be 60 - (11 x 6) = 40. Therefore, 40 chairs will remain unoccupied.
Response:  We have 12 tables with 14 chairs each, so that's 12 x 14 = 168 chairs in total. Then we have 6 extra chairs, which brings the total number of chairs to 168 + 6 = 174 chairs for all guests. Therefore, each guest will have 174/12 = 14.5 chairs. Since you can't have a fraction of a chair, the final answer is 14 chairs per guest.
Response:  If there are 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since there will be 14 guests attending the party, they will need an additional 2 chairs (14 - 12 = 2). Therefore, the host must buy 2 more chairs.
Response:  If they have 14 chairs for every table and there are 9 tables, then we can calculate how many chairs they have in total as follows: Number of chairs = Total number of tables x Number of chairs per table = 9 x 14 = 126 chairs So, there are more than 9 stools (126 - 9 = 117) than the number of stools (9).
Response:  If Lewis earns $460 during five weeks of harvesting and he works for 5 days a week, then his daily income can be calculated as follows:  Daily Income = Total Weekly Earnings / Number of Working Days per Week  Daily Income = $460 / 5 days/week = $92 per day
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned $1216 during harvest and he earns $16 per week. To find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we can divide the total amount of money he earned ($1216) by his weekly income ($16):

$1216 / $16 = 75 weeks

So, the harvest lasted for 75 weeks."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income from farming is:  $$ Total Income = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Earnings = 216 \times $21 = $4536$$  Now, we are asked to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season after paying $702 in taxes. To do this, we need to subtract the amount he pays in taxes from his total income:  $$ Money Left After Taxes = Total Income - Taxes Paid = $4536 - $702 = $3834$$  So, Lewis will have $3834 left after paying $702 in taxes at the end of the harvest season.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks, he will have earned a total of:

$1357 x 223 = $294,011

Now, if he works for 73 seasons at the same rate, he will have earned:

$294,011 x 73 = $6,087,333

Therefore, Lewis will have earned $6,087,333 working for 73 seasons."
Response:  During the growing season (1091 days), Lewis earns $28 per day. Therefore, his total income during the growing season is: $$ Total Income = Number of Days \times Daily Wage = 1091 \times 28 = $ 3,164$$ Now, let's calculate his weekly income for overtime work: Since he works overtime every week, we can assume that his weekly income from overtime work is constant. So, his weekly income from overtime work is: $$ Weekly Overtime Income = Total Income / Number of Weeks Worked = $ 3,164 / 52 = $ 60.75$$ Therefore, Lewis earns a total of $3,164 during the growing season and an additional $60.75 per week for overtime work, making his total yearly income $3,224.50.
"Response:  We know that Lewis makes $403 per week for 233 weeks of work. To find out how much he earns in total during this period, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works:

$403/week x 233 weeks = $91,530

Now, let's calculate how much Lewis pays in rent each week:

$49/week

So, how much does Lewis have left after paying his rent each week?

$91,530 - ($49/week) x 233 weeks = $68,770

Therefore, Lewis has $68,770 left after paying his rent each week during the 233-week period."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks of work. If he has to pay $388 in rent every week, then he will have to pay a total of $524,704 in rent during his entire working period (1359 weeks x $388/week).
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks.  So his total income is:  $$ Total Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks = $491 x 1181 = $573,071$$ Now we need to find out how much he will have at the end of the period when he has to pay $216 rent every week. To do this, we divide his total income by the number of weeks he has to pay rent:  $$ Amount Left After Rent = Total Income / Number of Weeks of Rent = $573,071 / 1181 = $485,677$$ Therefore, at the end of the period, Lewis will have $485,677 left after paying $216 rent every week.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $133 in 19 weeks, that means he earns:

$133 / 19 weeks = $7 per week
So, Lewis earns $7 per week."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per day during harvest and earns a total of $178, then we can calculate how many days he worked as follows:

$178 / $2 per day = 89 days

Therefore, Lewis worked for 89 days during the harvest season."
Response:  We know that Dean is 5 feet (60 inches) tall and the water is 10 times deeper than him, so the depth of the water is 10 x 60 = 600 inches. Since he is standing on the surface, his height above the water level is 9 feet - 600 inches = 50 inches. So, the depth of the water relative to Dean's height is 600 - 50 = 550 inches.
Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet tall (or 96 inches). Since the depth of water is twice Dean's height, we can say that the depth of water is equal to 2 times 96 = 192 inches. Now, since Ron is 7 feet tall and standing in 14 feet of water, we can say that he is 7 feet + 14 feet = 21 feet above sea level. So, the depth of water from sea level would be 21 - 7 = 14 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron is taller than Dean by 3 meters (or 9 feet). So if Ron stands at 12 steps of height, then Dean stands at 9 steps of height less than Ron. Now we need to find out how many times deeper the water is compared to Ron's height. Since the depth of the water is five times greater than Ron's height, we can say that for every one meter of Ron's height, the water is five meters deep. Therefore, if Ron stands at 12 steps of height, which means he is 12 \* 0.3 = 3.6 meters tall, then the water is 5 \* 3.6 = 18 meters deep.
"Response:  We know that Dean is $1$ meter taller than Ron, so their height difference is $\text{1 m} = \text{100 cm}$.  Since the water depth is $15\times$ higher than Dean's height, we can write:
$$\text{water depth} = 15\times(\text{Dean's height}) = 15\times(100\text{ cm})$$
Now, we know that Ron stands at $13\text{ stops}$ (or $13\times\text{cm}$) below the surface of the water. So, we can set up the following equation:
$$\text{Ron's height} = \text{water depth} - (\text{Dean's height})$$
Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:
$$\boxed{\text{Ron's height} = 1500\text{ cm} - 100\text{ cm}}$$
Therefore, the depth of the water was $1400\text{ cm}$ ($= 15\times(100\text{ cm}) - 100\text{ cm}$)."
Response:  We know that Dean is 9 feet (or 108 inches) taller than Ron. So if Ron stands at 13 feet (or 152 inches), then Dean will stand at 23 feet (or 274 inches). Now we can use the fact that the water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height to find out how deep the water is relative to Dean. Therefore, the depth of the water is 16 x 152 = 2314 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this value to feet as follows: 2314 inches / 12 = 192 feet. So the water was 192 feet deep.
"Response:  We know that Dean is $6$ feet shorter than Ron, so their height difference is $6$. Since the depth of water is $9$ times greater than Dean's height, we can write:
$$\text{depth} = 9 \times \text{Dean}'s \text{height}$$
Now, we are told that the depth of water is $18$ feet. So, substituting $\text{Dean}'s \text{height}$ with $6$, we get:
$$\text{depth} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ feet}$$
Therefore, the depth of water was $54$ feet."
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to divide them equally among two shelves, then each shelf will have 34/2 = 17 books.
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then we can calculate how many bookshelves he has as follows:

Number of books = Total number of books x Number of books per shelf
= 42 x 2
= 84

So, Brian has 84 bookshelves."
"Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each of his 23 police stations has an average of 80 magazines, then the total number of books he has is:

$$ \text {Total number of books} = \text {Number of books per station} \times \text{ Number of stations} $$

So, the total number of books Brian has is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of books}} = 27 \times 23 = 611 $$
Therefore, Brian has 611 books in total."
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book takes up one shelf (regál), then he must have 9 shelves in total. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine takes up one shelf, then he must have 46 shelves in total as well. Now, we know that Brian has 10 regálů, so the number of shelves he has is equal to 10 times the number of books or magazines he owns. Therefore, the number of magazines Brian has is 10 x 46 = 460.
"Response:  If Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 police boxes, then he has a total of:

* Books: 23 x 29 = 657 books
* Magazines: 61 x 29 = 1749 magazines

So, Brian has a total of 657 books and 1749 magazines in all his police boxes combined."
Response:  We know that Brian has 7 police officers and each of them has the same number of books. So, if we divide the total number of books (28) by the number of police officers (7), we get the average number of books per officer: $ \boxed{4} $. Therefore, there are 4 books in each police car.
Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookshelf contains two books, then how many bookshelves does he have?  We can write an equation to represent this situation: Bookshelves = Number of Books / Number of Books per Shelf. In this case, we know that Number of Books = 38 and Number of Books per Shelf = 2. So, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for Number of Bookshelves: Number of Bookshelves = 38 / 2 = 19. Therefore, Brian has 19 bookshelves.
"Response:  If Carol wants to invite 10 friends and each package contains 2 invitations, then she needs:

$$ Number of packages = \frac{Total number of friends}{Number of invitations per package} $$

In this case, $ Total number of friends = 10 $ and $ Number of invitations per package = 2 $. So we can calculate:

$$ Number of packages = \frac{10}{2} = 5 $$

Therefore, Carol needs 5 packages to invite all her friends without leaving any out."
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 12 friends and bought three packages of equal size, then each package must contain 12/3 = 4 invitations. Therefore, there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packages of invitations and each package contains 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations.  If she sends invitations to only two friends, then the number of invitations left is 70 - (2 x 10) = 70 - 20 = 50 invitations. Therefore, there are 50 invitations left.
Response:  If Carol bought 6 packages of invitations with each package containing 14 invitations, then she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, if she also bought 11 more packages, that means she has an additional 11 x 14 = 154 invitations. So, in total, Carol can invite 84 + 154 = 238 friends to her party.
Response:  If Carol bought 2 packages of invitations each containing 3 invitations, then she has in total 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To invite 9 friends, she will need to buy additional 3 packages of invitations (9 - 6 = 3). So, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played n games, then her total score is:  Total score = Number of games x Points per game = n x 12 = 36 (since we are told that if she scored 36 points, she must have played at least one game) So, to find out how many games Melissa played, we can set up an equation using the information given in the question: Number of games = Total score / Points per game = 36 / 12 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa played 3 games and scored 81 points in total, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points in each game as well. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can use the formula: Total points = Points per game x Number of games played. In this case, the number of games played is 79. So, if we substitute these values into the formula, we get: Total points = 109 x 79 = 8631. Therefore, Melissa scored 8631 points in 79 games.
Response:  If Melissa played x games and scored 7 points in each game, then she totalled 21 points. We can write this as an equation:  x \* 7 = 21. Solving for x, we get : x = 3. So, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and played 13 games with each game being the same, then she must have scored an average of 6.85 points per game (91/13).
Response:  We know that Rolety and Paradise Park have 4 seats each. If 20 people can be on the road at the same time, then we need to divide 20 by the number of seats in each car. So, if Rolety has 4 seats, then 20 / 4 = 5 people can ride in it simultaneously. Similarly, if Paradise Park has 4 seats as well, then 20 / 4 = 5 people can ride in it simultaneously too. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If the big wheel in Paradise Park has 2 seats and each seat can hold 9 people, then we have: Number of seats = 2 x 9 = 18 seats available for riders. So, if 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, then it means that the capacity of the Ferris wheel is 18 people. Therefore, the number of places (or seats) on the Ferris wheel is 18.
Response:  We know that each bike in Paradise Park has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, if we have 20 bikes, how many people can ride them altogether? To find out, let's multiply the number of seats per bike (19) by the number of people who can sit on one seat (15): 20 x 19 = 380 people. Therefore, 380 people can ride the 20 bikes in Paradise Park!
Response:  If Rolety and Paradise Park have 18 seats in total, then each seat can accommodate 15 people. When 10 of those seats are occupied, that means there are 180 people who can go on the roller coaster (18 x 15 = 270). So, the answer is 270 people.
Response:  We know that Rolety and Paradise Park have 6 seats each, and each seat can accommodate 14 people. If there are currently 16 people on the roller coaster, we need to find out how many more people can be added. To do this, we divide the total number of people (16) by the number of seats available per car (14): $ \frac {16} {14} = 2$ Therefore, two additional people can be added to the roller coaster.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the big wheel. Each small seat can hold 14 people, so we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can sit in the small seats. Now, let's count how many people can sit in the large seats:  There are 23 large seats, and each of them can hold 54 people, so we have 23 x 54 = 1206 people who can sit in the large seats. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 28 + 1206 = 1234 people.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in the big wheel. Each small seat can hold 16 people, so we have 3 x 16 = 48 people who can sit in the small seats. Now, each large seat can hold 12 people, so we have 7 x 12 = 84 people who can sit in the large seats. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the big wheel is 48 + 84 = 132 people.
Response:  If there are 16 people who want to go on the roller coaster in Paradise Park at once and each car has 4 seats, then we need to calculate how many people can fit in one car. Therefore, the number of people that can fit in one car is 16 / 4 = 4. So, 4 people can fit in each car.
Response:  If we have 4 people who want to ride bicycles in the park at the same time and each bicycle can carry 2 people, then we need to know how many bicycles are needed to accommodate all 4 riders. Therefore, the number of bicycles required is 4 / 2 = 2. So, there are 2 bicycles that can carry 4 riders in total.
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices (platks), then the total number of slices is 7 x Number of slices in one pizza = 7 x 14 = 98 slices. So there are 98 slices in all 7 pizzas combined.
"Response:  If we have 28 slices of pizza and each slice has two pieces, then... (1 mark)

Answer: We have 28 x 2 = 56 slices of pizza in total. (1 mark)"
Response:  If we have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is: 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Since there are 25 people, the number of slices per person is: 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices per person.
Response:  If we have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. To divide them equally among 2 people means each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices.
"Response:  If Paige helped her mother with flowers and they planted seeds in 45 flower beds, then...

Step 1: How many seed packets did they use for each flower bed? Since they gave 10 seeds to each flower bed, the number of seed packets used is:

Number of seed packets = Number of flower beds x Number of seeds per flower bed
= 45 x 10
= 450 seed packets

So, they used 450 seed packets in total."
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and there are 9 flower beds, then each flower bed contains how many seeds?  We can divide the total number of seeds by the number of flower beds to find out:  Number of seeds per flower bed = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds = 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per flower bed. So, if they want to put the same amount of seeds into each flower bed, they will need to put 5 seeds into each flower bed.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother together planted 36 seeds in their garden. Since only 58 of them grew into flowers, we can conclude that 36 - 58 = 20 seeds did not grow into flowers. Therefore, there were 20 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother together planted 55 seeds in their garden. Since they only gave each seedling 15 seeds to grow, then the total number of seedlings is: 55 x 15 = 825. Now we are told that out of these 825 seedlings, only 60 actually grew into flowers. So the final answer is:  Number of flowers = 825 - 60 = 765.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother with 10 seeds in each flower pot and they planted 60 seeds in total, then we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per flower pot = 60 seeds / 10 seeds/pot = 6 flowers. Therefore, there will be 6 flowers.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother with 8 flower beds and planted 32 seeds in total, then she must have planted 4 seeds per bed (since 32 / 8 = 4). So, if she were to plant the same number of seeds in each flowerbed, she would plant 4 seeds in each one.
Response:  If Matthew had 11 friends and gave each of them 2 suckers, he would have given away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 suckers. So, Matthew had 22 - 2 = 20 suckers left for himself.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 suckers and gave each of his friends 2 suckers, then he would have given away a total of 16 suckers (8 x 2 = 16). So, Matthew gave suckers to 16 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 crackers and gave the same number to each of his 5 friends, then he would have given away 15 x 5 = 75 crackers in total. So, if he still has 10 crackers left, that means he must have given away 75 - 10 = 65 crackers. Therefore, each of Matthew's 5 friends received 65 / 5 = 13 sušenek (crackers).
Response:  If Matthew had 24 candies and gave an equal number to his three friends, then he gave 8 candies to each friend (since 3 x 8 = 24). So, Matthew has 17 candies left after giving them away.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 sušenky and gave each of his 11 friends an equal number (not necessarily the same amount), then he would have given away 22/11 = 2 sušenky per friend. Similarly, if he had 34 koláče and gave each of his 11 friends an equal number (not necessarily the same amount), then he would have given away 34/11 = 3koláče per friend. Therefore, each of Matthew's friends sneezed 2 sušenky and ate 3 koláče.
Response:  If Matthew had 29 sušenek and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 14.5 sušenek (29 / 2 = 14.5) to each friend. Since each friend also received 30 koláčů, they together consumed 42 colachs (14.5 x 3 = 42).
Response:  If Matthew had 14 sušenek and 21 dortů, that means he had in total 35 sweets (14 sušenek + 21 dortů).  Since he gave them to his seven friends, each friend got an equal number of sweets. So, if we divide 35 sweets equally among 7 friends, each friend will get 5 sweets (35 / 7 = 5).
Response:  If Matthew had 36 suckers and divided them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would get 2 suckers (36/18 = 2). So, Matthew sneezed 2 suckers.
"Response:  If Matthew has 36 sušenek and he wants to give each of his friends six sušenek, then he will have to distribute them equally among his friends. So, he will give:
Matthew = 36 / 6 = 6 friends
Therefore, Matthew gave six sušenek to each of his six friends."
Response:  If Matthew had 23 cookies and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he would have given away 23/2 = 11 cookies. So, each friend got 11 cookies.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 suckers and gave some to his friends. If he gave the same number of suckers to each friend, then we can say that he gave x suckers to each friend. Since there are 5 friends in total, we can write an equation as follows: 31 = 5x. Now, solving for x, we get: x = 6. So, Matthew gave 6 suckers to each of his 5 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 32 sušenek and gave some to his four friends, let's say he gave 4 sušenky each to two of them (since they are friends). So, now Matthew has 32 - 8 = 24 sušenek left. Then, if he gives 98 colačů to all four friends, each friend will get 98 / 4 = 24 colači. Therefore, each friend got 24 sušenek and 24 colači.
Response:  If Matthew had 10 sušenek and 8 colačů, that means he has a total of 18 snacks (10 + 8).  Since he wants to share them equally among his four friends, each friend will get 4.5 snacks (18 / 4 = 4.5). So, each friend will have eaten 4.5 colačů.
Response:  If Matthew had 13 sušenek and gave them to 28 friends, then each friend got an average of 0.46 (13/28) sušenek. Similarly, if he had 15 colačů and gave them to 28 friends, then each friend got an average of 0.57 (15/28) colačů. So, each friend pojedl approximately 0.46 sušenek and 0.57 colačů.
Response:  We know that Debbie bought some water at a discounted price and consumed 109 bottles per day for 74 days. To find out how many bottles she bought initially, we can use the following formula: Number of bottles = Total consumption / Daily consumption x Number of days  So, in this case, we have: Number of bottles = 109 bottles/day x 74 days = 8260 bottles Therefore, Debbie bought 8260 bottles of water initially when it was on sale.
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale and she drank the same number of bottles every day. If each bottle lasted for 17 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she drank per day as follows: Number of bottles drunk per day = Total number of bottles / Number of days she drank them So, in this case, the total number of bottles is 153, and the number of days she drank them is 17. Therefore, the number of bottles she drank per day is: Number of bottles drunk per day = 153 / 17 = 9 bottles per day
"Response:  If she bought 264 bottles of water at $3 each and consumed 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles are left as follows:

Day 1: She consumed 15 bottles, so there are 264 - 15 = 249 bottles left.
Day 2: She consumed another 15 bottles, so there are 249 - 15 = 234 bottles left.
...
Day 11: She consumed another 15 bottles, so there are 234 - 15 = 219 bottles left.
Therefore, there are 219 bottles of water left after 11 days."
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 bottles of water when they were on sale and she consumed 144 bottles per day for several days. So, we can calculate how many bottles are left as follows: Number of bottles left = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles consumed per day x Number of days consumed = 301 - (144 x 5) = 157 Therefore, there are 157 bottles left.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda at a discount, that means she saved $88 + $13 = $101.  If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of lemonade per day, we can calculate how long her supply will last as follows:

Days Supply Lasts = Total Number of Bottles / Daily Consumption
= 101 / 95 (since she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of lemonade)
= 10.6 days
Therefore, Debbie's supply of water and lemonade will last for approximately 10.6 days."
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 cans of soda when they were on sale, then she has a total of 456 units of drinks (200 + 256 = 456).  If she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 cans of soda per day, we need to find out how many days her supply will last. To do this, we divide the total number of drinks by the daily consumption: 456 / 312 = 1.47 days. So, Debbie's supply of drinks would last approximately 1.47 days if she continues to consume at that rate.
"Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 liters of water per day and buys 12 liters in total, she will have enough water for:

Days = Total amount of water / Amount consumed per day
= 12 L / 6 L
= 2 days
Therefore, Debbie can last for 2 days with the 12 liters of water she bought."
Response:  If she bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water, then together they add up to 275 bottles (95 + 180 = 275).  If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of lemonade per day, we can calculate how many days those bottles will last her as follows:  Number of bottles = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption  Number of bottles = 275 / (15 + 54)  Number of bottles = 275 / 69  Number of bottles = 3.9 days  Therefore, if Debbie drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of lemonade per day, those bottles will last her approximately 3.9 days.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she has a total of:

$$ Total = 360 + 162 = 522 $$

bottles of drinks.
If she drinks $ 122$ bottles of water per day and $ 9$ bottles of lemonade per day, we can calculate how many days the lemonade will last her as follows:

$$ Days = Total - Drunk = 522 - (122 + 9) = 401 $$
Therefore, the lemonade will last Debbie for $ 401 $ days."
"Response:  If Faye placed her pencils in 14 rows with 11 pencils in each row, then...

1. How many rows does Faye have in total?
2. How many pencils are there in total?
3. What is the number of pencils per row?
4. How many pencils are there in one row?
5. How many pencils does Faye have in total?

Let's calculate these numbers and find out how many pencils Faye has!"
Response:  We know that Faye placed 12 pens equally spaced in three rows. Since there are 3 rows, we can say that she placed 4 pens in each row (since 3 x 4 = 12). So, the number of pens Faye gave to each row is 4.
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 krabic tužek and each krabic contains 24 tužek. So, in total, she has 28 x 24 = 672 tužek. Now, we are asked how many rows can be made with these tužky. To find this out, we need to divide the number of tužek by the number of tužky in each row. Since there are 16 tužek in each row, we can divide 672 tužek by 16 to get the number of rows: 672 / 16 = 43 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 43 rows with her tužky.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 6 bags of pencils and each bag contains 14 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is:

6 bags x 14 pencils/bag = 84 pencils
So, there are 84 pencils in total."
Response:  If Faye has 35 tužků and 7 pastels, she can make at most 5 rows of tužky with each row containing 7 tužek (since there are only 7 pastels). Therefore, the maximum number of rows that Faye can make is 5 x 7 = 35. So, the answer is 35 rows.
Response:  If there are 19 rows and each row has 4 tufts, then the total number of tufts is 19 x 4 = 76.  And if there are 27 pastels in each row, then the total number of pastels is 76 x 27 = 2015. Therefore, the answer to the question is 2015.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils and crayons in seven rows with 36 pencils and 30 crayons in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils in each row = 7 x 36 = 252 pencils Therefore, there are 252 pencils in total. Now, let's move to the crayons. Since there are 30 crayons in each row, we can calculate the total number of crayons as follows: Total number of crayons = Number of rows x Number of crayons in each row = 7 x 30 = 210 crayons Therefore, there are 210 crayons in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils and crayons in 11 rows with 31 pencils and 27 crayons in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils in each row = 11 x 31 = 341 pencils Now, let's calculate the total number of crayons: Total number of crayons = Number of rows x Number of crayons in each row = 11 x 27 = 307 crayons Therefore, Faye has a total of 341 pencils and 307 crayons.
Response:  If Faye placed 30 tusks in rows, and each row had 5 tusks, then...  We can start counting from the first row: Row 1 has 5 tusks, so it contains 5 tusks. Now we move to the second row: Row 2 also has 5 tusks, so it contains 5 more tusks than the first row (total of 10 tusks). The same logic applies to all subsequent rows. Therefore, there are 10 rows in total, with each row containing 5 tusks. So, the final answer is 10 rows x 5 tusks/row = 50 tusks.
Response:  If Faye has 6 pencils and wants to place them in two rows, she will have to divide them equally between the two rows. So, if she places 3 pencils in one row and 3 pencils in the other row, then each row contains an equal number of pencils (i.e., 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Faye had 35 pencils and each pencil has 4 leads. So, we can write this as an equation: 35 + 35 = 70. Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 since there are two rows of pencils: 70 / 2 = 35. Therefore, Faye could make 35 rows of pencils.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 boxes of pencils and each box contained 6 pencils. So, in total, she had 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Then, we are told that she placed her pencils into rows, with each row containing 19 pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils in one row is 19. Since there are n/2 rows, the total number of pencils is n x 19 = 1860. So, the answer is 1860.
"Response:  We know that Faye placed 71 pastels and 24 pencils in each of the 30 rows. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

$$ \text {Total number of pencils} = 24 \times 30 = 640 $$
So, there are $ 640 $ pencils in total."
Response:  If there are 16 rows and each row has 6 pastels, then the total number of pastels is 16 x 6 = 96.  And if there are 21 tužků in each row, then the total number of tužků is 21 x 16 = 320. So, the answer to the question is 96 + 320 = 416.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in total and 98 students attending the school. Since each class has an average of 5-6 students (which is just an estimate), we can assume that there will be around 40-50 students per bus trip. So, if all 7 buses are full, then the number of students who can go on the field trip = Total number of students x Number of buses / Capacity of one bus = 98 students x 7 buses / 40 students/bus = 360 students. Therefore, there will be 360 students going on the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and each class has an average of 30 students (this is just an assumption). So, we have:
Number of classes = 84
Number of students per class = 30
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
Since there are 95 school buses and each bus can accommodate 118 students, we can calculate the total number of students who will be going on the field trip as follows:
Number of students going on the field trip = Total number of students x Number of buses
= 2520 x 95
= 240,500 students
Therefore, the correct answer is 240,500 students."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in total and each class has 66 students. So, we have:
Number of classes = 67
Number of students per class = 66
Now, we need to find out how many students will be going on the field trip. Since there are 6 seats available in each bus, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:
Number of students going on the field trip = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus
= 66 x 67 (classes)
= 4082 students
So, we need 4082/6 = 673 buses for all the students to go on the field trip together."
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in total and each class has 58 students. So, we have:
Number of students = 87 x 58 = 4960 students.
Since each bus can accommodate 2 students, we need:
Number of buses required = Number of students / Capacity of each bus = 4960 / 2 = 248 buses."
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in total and each class has the same number of students as there are school buses (120). So, we can write an equation: Number of students per class = Number of school buses x Number of students per school bus. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of students per class = 120 x 84 = 9600. Therefore, there are 9600 students in total in all 24 classes.
"Response:  We know that there are 66 classes in the school and 102 students who want to go on the field trip. Since each bus can hold 8 students, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many buses are needed:

Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus
= 102 students / 8 students/bus
= 13 buses
Therefore, the school needs 13 buses for the field trip."
Response:  If there are 102 classes and 11 students per class, then there are 102 x 11 = 1121 students in total.  Since there are 99 seats available in each bus, we can divide the number of students by 99 to find out how many will fit in each bus: 1121 / 99 = 11.34 students per bus.  So, if 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then approximately 11 - 8 = 3 more students than originally planned (i.e., 11 x 3/102 = 33 students) will be able to go on the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in total and each class has 3 students (on average). So, we have:
Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class
= 72 x 3
= 216 students
Now, we need to find out how many buses are needed for this trip. Since each bus can accommodate 3 students, we divide the total number of students by 3:
Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of students per bus
= 216 / 3
= 72 buses
Therefore, 72 buses are needed for this trip."
Response:  We know that there are 46 students in total and 17 classes. If all buses are full, then each bus can carry at most 92/17 = 5 students. So, there are 92 / 5 = 18 students per bus.
Response:  If there are 11 boys and each boy gets 9 marbles from Haley, then the total number of marbles given out is 11 x 9 = 99 marbles.
Response:  If Haley has 10 kulicheks and gives each of the boys 5 kulicheks, then she gave out a total of 5 x 4 = 20 kulicheks. So there are 20 boys in this scenario.
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for himself, that means he will have 9 marbles left to share with his friends. Since there are four boys in total, each boy will get 9/4 = 2 marbles from Haley. Therefore, each boy will get 2 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who love playing marbles and each of them gets 4 marbles (since they have 26 in total), then each boy will get 4/13 = 1/3 marble. Similarly, if there are 50 boys who love playing cards and each of them gets 7 cards (since they have 350 in total), then each boy will get 7/50 = 1/7 card.
Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and there are boys in her class who like to play with them, then we can assume that they will divide the marbles equally among themselves. So, if there are x boys in the class, each boy will get x/20 of the total number of marbles (since Haley has 20 marbles). Therefore, the answer is x/20.
Response:  If there are n boys playing marbles and each boy has 2 marbles, then the total number of marbles is 2n. Since Haley gave each boy 2 marbles, the total number of marbles given away is 2(2n) = 4n. So, if there were 28 boys playing marbles, Haley gave away 4 x 28 = 112 marbles.
"Response:  If Frank read 14 pages per day and the book had 392 pages in total, then he took X days to finish reading it. We can write an equation based on this information:

X = (Total number of pages - Number of pages read per day) / Number of pages read per day

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

X = (392 - 14) / 14 = 30 days
Therefore, Frank took 30 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, there are 12380 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took six days to finish reading his favorite book. So, he read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the number of pages (612) by the time it took him to finish reading the book (six days).  Therefore, Frank read for approximately 102 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since there are 5 chapters in total, we can calculate how many pages each chapter has by dividing the number of pages (555) by the number of chapters (5). Therefore, each chapter has approximately 111 pages (555 / 5 = 111).
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since there are 15 chapters in the book, we can calculate how many days he spent on each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total number of days / Number of chapters So, if Frank took 660 days to read the entire book, and there are 15 chapters in total, then he must have spent approximately 44 days (660 / 15) reading each chapter. Therefore, Frank read one chapter every 44 days.
Response:  If Frank took three days to finish reading all the books (3 d = 3 x 249 = 747 pages), then he read 747 pages per day.
Response:  If Frank took 12 days to read each book and he had to read 66 books in total, then it will take him 784 days (66 x 12 = 784) to finish reading all the books. So, if it took him 492 days to finish reading all the books, that means he has finished reading 302 books (492 - 784 = -382). Therefore, Frank has read 302 books.
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book, and the book has 112 pages, then we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Days = 16
Pages per day = Pages / Days
= 112 / 16
= 7 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days."
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day (as stated in the question), then he will finish reading the book in:

Time = Number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 576 pages / 8 pages/day
= 72 days
Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 450 pages and there are 41 chapters in total, we can calculate how many pages Frank read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish reading the book
= 41 x 450 = 17,650 pages
= 17,650 pages / 30 days
= 589 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 589 pages per day."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate how many chapters Frank read per day as follows:

Chapters/Day = Total number of chapters / Time taken to finish the book
= 3 chapters / 607 days
= 1/208 chapters per day

Therefore, there are approximately 1/208 chapters in each chapter of the book."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Chapters/Days = Pages/Days
= 405 pages / 664 days
= 0.62 chapters/day
So, Frank read approximately 0.62 chapters per day during the time it took him to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  If six DVD boxes can be bought for $120, then we know that each box costs $120 / 6 = $20 per box. Therefore, each box costs $20.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then the cost of 33 packages would be:
$81 x 33 = $2633."
"Response:  If each DVD box costs $107, then we have:

$107/DVD = Cost per DVD

If there is a discount of $106 on each DVD, then we can calculate the new price as follows:

New Price = Old Price - Discount
= $107 - ($106 x Number of DVDs)

Now, if you want to buy X DVDs for $93, we can set up the following equation:

X x $107 = Total cost of buying X DVDs
-$106x = Subtraction of discount amount from total cost
= $93

Therefore, you can buy X DVDs for $93 if:

X = (Total cost of buying X DVDs - Discount amount) / $107
= ( $93 - $106X ) / $107
= X

So, the number of DVDs you can buy for $93 is:

X = 106

Answer: You can buy 106 DVDs for $93."
Response:  If each DVD box costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 for each box, then we need to calculate how much we would pay for each box after applying the discount. So, the amount we pay for each box = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each DVD box.
"Response:  We have $104 to spend and we want to buy as many DVD boxes as possible. So, we will divide $104 by $26 (the price of each box) to find out how many boxes we can afford to buy:
$104 / $26 = 4
So, we can buy 4 DVD boxes with our $104."
Response:  If we can buy 2 DVD boxes for $ 28, then each box must cost half of that amount or $14.
Response:  We know that in Philip's collection of bananas, there are 18 bananas in total. If we group them into sets of size 2, then each set will contain 9 bananas (since 18 / 2 = 9). So, there are 9 groups of bananas in total.
Response:  We know that in Philip's collection of bananas, there are bananas. So, we can start counting how many groups of bananas he has based on their size. According to the question, each group must contain at least 187 bananas. Therefore, we will divide the total number of bananas by 187 to find out how many groups of bananas Philip has.  Total number of bananas = Number of groups of bananas x Number of bananas per group  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total number of bananas = 140 x 187  = 23,600 bananas Now, let's simplify the equation:  Total number of bananas / 187 = Number of groups of bananas  Simplifying further, we get: 23,600 / 187 = 125 groups of bananas  Therefore, Philip has 125 groups of bananas in his collection.
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and 63 oranges. If we divide the bananas into 7 groups of equal size, each group will contain 28 bananas (203 / 7 = 28). Now, let's find out how many groups of oranges can be formed if they are divided into 95 groups of equal size. To do this, we need to divide 63 oranges by 95 groups, which gives us 0.66 oranges per group (63 / 95 = 0.66). Therefore, each group contains approximately 0.66 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in total. If we divide the bananas into groups of 47, then each group will contain 142/47 = 3 bananas. Similarly, if we divide the oranges into groups of 178, then each group will contain 356/178 = 2 oranges. Therefore, each group of oranges contains 2 oranges.
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide this number by the total number of bananas (392), we get:

Number of bananas per group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups
= 392 / 196
= 2

So, each group contains 2 bananas."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains 18 bananas. So, if we have 180 bananas in total, then the number of groups is:

180 / 18 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas and we want to divide them into two groups. So, let's assume that one group has x bananas. Then, we have 290 - x bananas left over. Now, we also know that there are 87 pomeranches and we want to divide them into 93 groups. So, each group of pomeranches contains y pomeranches, where y is the number of groups minus 1 (since we don't need any groups for the remaining pomeranches). Therefore, we can write the following equation: 290 = x + (93-1)y  Substituting the value of x from the question, we get: 290 = 87 + (93-1)(y) Solving for y, we get: y = 146  Therefore, each group of bananas contains 146 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 pomerančů and 192 bananas in total. If we divide the bananas into groups of 345, then each group will contain 345/192 = 1.76 bananas on average. Now, let's find out how many groups of pomeranches there are. According to the question, there are 16 groups of pomeranches. Therefore, the number of pomeranches in each group is 16 x 384 = 6072. So, the size of each group of pomeranches is 6072 / 16 = 378 pomeranches.
"Response:  If Brendina made 38 sušenek and each of them has 19 sušenek inside, then we can calculate how many hosts she prepared sušenky for as follows:

Number of sušenek = Total number of sušenek / Number of sušenek in each one
= 38 / 19
= 2
So, Brendina prepared sušenky for 2 hosts."
"Response:  If there are 14 people and each of them has 30 suckers, then we have:

Number of suckers = Number of people x Number of suckers per person
= 14 x 30
= 420 suckers
Therefore, Brendina made 420 suckers for the 14 people."
Response:  If Brendina made 5 sundries and had to throw away 17 of them, that means she had 22 sundries in total (5 + 17 = 22). Now, if each person got an equal number of sundries, then the number of sundries each person would get is 22 / 5 = 4. So, each person would have 4 sundries.
Response:  If Brendina made 18 sušenek and 10 hosts came, then each host had 18/10 = 1.8 sušenek. But if only 9 hosts came, then each host has 18/9 = 2 sušenek.
Response:  If there are 14 sušenky for two hosts and each of them has an equal number of sušenek, then we can conclude that each host has half of the total number of sušenek. Therefore, each host has 14/2 = 7 sušenek.
Response:  If Brendina made 10 sundries for guests and each guest had 2 sundries, then the number of guests is 10/2 = 5 guests.
"Response:  We know that Frank had 42 pieces of candy and he divided them into two boxes. So, we can assume that each box contains an equal number of candies. Therefore, if x is the number of candies in one box, then we can write the equation:

x = 42 / 2

Solving for x, we get:

x = 21

So, there are 21 pieces of candy in each of the two boxes."
Response:  We know that Frank had some candies and he divided them equally among 26 bags with 33 pieces of candy in each bag. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces of candy as follows: Total number of pieces = Number of bags x Number of pieces per bag Total number of pieces = 26 x 33 = 840 pieces of candy Therefore, Frank had 840 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 remaining pieces of candy. If we want to divide these 9 pieces equally among 9 boxes ( each box can hold 9 pieces), then we will need 9 / 9 = 1 box. Therefore, Frank needs 1 box to store his remaining candies.
Response:  If Frank has 11 pieces of candy from each pot and he has 22 pieces in total, then he must have had 2 times as many pots as he had pieces of candy. So if he had 11 pieces of candy from each pot, he must have had 2 x 11 = 22 pots in total. Therefore, Frank must have had 22 sacks.
Response:  We know that Frank has 16 kousků (pieces) of bonbónu (chocolate). He wants to divide them equally among two boxes or bags. So he will put 8 pieces in each box/bag. Therefore, there are 8 kousků (pieces) of bonbónu (chocolate) in each bag/box.
Response:  We have to deliver 25 boxes of trefoils. Each box contains 14 packets of trefoils. So we need to deliver 25 x 14 = 350 packets of trefoils in total.
Response:  If Shirley has 10 boxes of trefoils and she needs to deliver 5 boxes of trefoils, then we can calculate as follows: Number of boxes = Total number of boxes / Number of boxes needed to be delivered = 10/5 = 2. So, there are 2 boxes of trefoils that Shirley needs to deliver.
"Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular lemonade and 9 bottles of dietary lemonade. To find out how many more bottles of regular lemonade there are than dietary lemonade, we can divide the number of regular lemonade bottles by the number of dietary lemonade bottles:

67 / 9 = 7

So, there are 7 more bottles of regular lemonade than dietary lemonade."
Response:  We know that there are 22 bottles of regular lemonade and 61 bottles of diet lemonade in total. To find out how many bottles of diet lemonade have more than regular lemonade, we need to subtract the number of regular bottles from the total number of bottles. So, the answer is:  Number of bottles of diet lemonade with more than regular lemonade = Total number of bottles - Number of regular bottles = 61 - 22 = 39 bottles. Therefore, 39 bottles of diet lemonade have more than regular lemonade.
"Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of regular lemonade and 8 bottles of dietary lemonade. Each bottle contains 8 fl oz (fluid ounces), so we have:

Regular lemonade: 30 x 8 = 240 fl oz
Dietary lemonade: 8 x 8 = 64 fl oz
Total volume of liquid: 240 + 64 = 304 fl oz
Now let's convert this to flacons (or ""lahve"" in Czech):

One flacon is approximately equal to 125 ml (milliliters). So:

304 fl oz / 125 ml/flacon = 2400 ml
Therefore, there were 2400 milliliters of lemonade in total, which is equivalent to 2.4 liters or 2400 ml."
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular lemonade and 53 bottles of dietary lemonade. To find out how many bottles of regular lemonade have more than dietary lemonade, we need to subtract the number of dietary lemonade from the total number of bottles of lemonade. So, if we subtract 53 from 79, we get:  79 - 53 = 26  Therefore, there are 26 bottles of regular lemonade that have more than dietary lemonade.
Response:  We know that there are 83 lahví běžné limonády and 54 lahví dietní limonády. To find out how many lahví běžné limonády have more than dietní, we need to subtract the number of dietní from the total number of běžné limonády: 83 - 54 = 29. So, there are 29 lahvá běžné limonády that have more than dietní.
Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles in total and 9 of them were regular lemonade bottles. So, the number of diet lemonade bottles is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, they had 8 bottles of diet lemonade.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 lahví dietní limonády and 60 lahví běžné limonády in total. To find out how many more bottles of regular lemonade than dietary lemonade, we need to subtract the number of dietary lemonade from the total number of lemonade bottles:

Total number of lemonade bottles = 19 + 60 = 79

So, there are 79 - 19 = 60 bottles of regular lemonade. Therefore, there are 60 more bottles of regular lemonade than dietary lemonade."
Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of regular lemonade and 32 bottles of diet lemonade. So together they make 104 bottles. Now we are asked how many more bottles than apples there were. Since there were 78 apples, we can subtract this number from 104 to find out how many more bottles there were: 104 - 78 = 26. Therefore, there were 26 additional bottles beyond the apples.
Response:  We know that there were 36 jars of apples and 80 bottles of regular lemonade. So, in total, there were 36 + 80 = 116 bottles or containers. Now we are asked how many more bottles than apples they had. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles: 116 - 36 = 80. Therefore, they had 80 additional bottles beyond the number of apples.
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were regular. So, we have 28 x 4 = 112 ml of regular lemonade. Since 1/4 of the total volume is regular lemonade, we can calculate the volume of diet lemonade as follows: Volume of diet lemonade = Total volume - Volume of regular lemonade = 30 - 112 = 22 ml. Therefore, there were 22 ml of diet lemonade.
Response:  We know that there were 4 lahve of dietary lemonade and 79 lahve of regular lemonade. So we can write an equation:  Number of lahves of regular lemonade = Total number of lahves - Number of lahves of dietary lemonade  Now we need to solve for the number of lahves of regular lemonade.  To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the total number of lahves:  Number of lahves of regular lemonade = (Total number of lahves - Number of lahves of dietary lemonade) / Total number of lahves  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of lahves of regular lemonade = (79 - 4) / 103  Simplifying, we get:  Number of lahves of regular lemonade = 75  Therefore, there were 75 lahves of regular lemonade.
"Response:  We know that there were 57 bottles of regular lemonade and 26 bottles of dietary lemonade. So, in total, we have:

57 + 26 = 83

So, there were 83 bottles of lemonade in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular lemonade and 60 bottles of dietary lemonade. So, we can write this as an equation:

81 = x + y

where x is the number of bottles of regular lemonade and y is the number of bottles of dietary lemonade.

We also know that there are 60 bottles of light lemonade. So, we can add this to our equation:

81 = x + y + z

where z is the number of bottles of light lemonade.

Now, we want to find out how many bottles of regular lemonade have more than dietary lemonade. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bottles of dietary lemonade from the total number of bottles of lemonade:

x - y =?

Substituting the values we know into this equation gives us:

81 - 60 = x - y

Solving for x (the number of bottles of regular lemonade) gives us:

x = 21

So, there are 21 bottles of regular lemonade that have more than dietary lemonade."
Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of regular lemonade and 40 bottles of dietary lemonade. So together they make up 49 + 40 = 89 bottles. Now we are asked how many bottles of light lemonade were sold. Since there were only 6 bottles of light lemonade, it is clear that this number must be added to the total number of bottles sold. Therefore, the final answer is 89 + 6 = 95 bottles.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 317 visitors the same day as Rachel, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22

Therefore, 22 more people visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question than visited the previous day."
"Response:  If there were 246 visitors yesterday and they visited the palace for 25 days, then we can calculate how many visitors came to the palace during those 25 days as follows:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors per day
= 246 / 10 (assuming an average of 24 visitors per day)
= 246 x 25
= 6,150

Therefore, during the past 25 days, approximately 6,150 people visited the Buckingham Palace."
Response:  We know that there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace after lunch and Rachel found out that 666 people had visited the palace the day before. So, if 100 people visited after lunch, then the total number of visitors to the palace that day is:  100 + 666 = 766 visitors.
Response:  We know that in total there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace during the day after lunch (from the information given). Now we need to find out how many people visited the palace in the previous 327 days. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days Since we are told that there were 406 visitors in total over the past 327 days, we can plug these values into the formula to get: Number of visitors per day = 406 / 327 = 1.25 visitors per day So, if 406 people visited Buckingham Palace in the previous 327 days, and 132 people visited the palace during the day after lunch, then the difference between these two numbers is: Difference = 406 - 132 = 274 people Therefore, 274 people visited Buckingham Palace in the previous 327 days.
Response:  We know that in total, 829 people visited Buckingham Palace during the last 85 days. If we divide this number by 85, we get the average number of visitors per day, which is 9.76 (rounded to two decimal places). Now, let's calculate how many visitors came to the palace on the specific day in question. According to the question, 45 people visited the palace after lunch. To find out how many visitors came before lunch, we need to subtract 45 from the total number of visitors during the last 85 days. Therefore, the number of visitors who came to Buckingham Palace before lunch on that particular day is:  Number of visitors before lunch = Total number of visitors x (85 - 45) / 85 = 829 x 0.37 = 291 visitors Before lunch on that day, therefore, there were 291 visitors at Buckingham Palace.
"Response:  If there were 557 visitors on that day and the previous day had 188 visitors, then we can calculate the total number of visitors in 57 days as follows:

Total visitors = Number of visitors on current day + (Number of visitors yesterday x 57)
= 557 + (188 x 57)
= 557 + 10,362
= 10,919
Therefore, during those 57 days, approximately 10,919 people visited the Buckingham Palace."
Response:  We know that there were 661 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and 600 visitors the day before. So, if we subtract the number of visitors the day before from the number of visitors on the current day, we get: 661 - 600 = 61. Therefore, there were 61 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the current day than on the previous day.
Response:  We know that there were 419 visitors the day before and 103 visitors the day before that. So, in total, there were 522 visitors before the day of the question (419 + 103). Now, we are told that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day of the question. Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before the day of the question is: 522 - 92 = 430.
"Response:  If there were 471 visitors the day before and 808 visitors the day before that, then there were a total of:

471 + 808 = 1279 visitors in the last 89 days."
Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and we want to find out how many more visitors came on that day than in the previous 245 days.  To do this, we can use the information given in the question about the number of visitors per day over those 245 days.  If there were 191 visitors per day before and 457 visitors per day after, then the average number of visitors per day over those 245 days is (191 + 457) / 2 = 348. So, if there were x visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question, then the difference between the number of visitors on that day and the average number of visitors over the previous 245 days is x - 348. Therefore, the answer is 463 visitors more than the average number of visitors over the previous 245 days.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed is 628 grams and we have already used 103 grams (as stated in the problem). So, to find out how much more wax is needed, we can subtract the amount already used from the total amount needed:

628 - 103 = 525 grams

Therefore, there are 525 grams of wax left to be used."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed is 288 grams and we have already used 260 grams. So, the remaining amount of wax needed is:

288 - 260 = 128 grams

Therefore, he needs an additional 128 grams of wax to complete the task."
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed to paint all the birds is 57g + 22g = 79g. Since each bird requires 353g of wax, we can calculate how many birds there are by dividing the total amount of wax required for painting them by the amount of wax required per bird: 79g / 353g = x. Therefore, there are x birds in total.
Response:  If one needs 166 grams of wax to bind feathers together and he has exactly 20 grams of wax, how much does he need? So, we can say that he needs 166 - 20 = 146 grams more wax.
"Response:  If we have 557 grams of wax and now need only 17 grams, then the amount of wax needed per gram of feathers is:

$$ \frac {17}{557} = 0.0304 $$

So, to calculate the number of grams of wax needed for one gram of feathers, we can multiply this value by $1000$, since there are $1000$ grams in a kilogram:

$$ 0.0304 \times 1000 = 30.4 $$

Therefore, the answer is $30.4$ grams of wax needed for one gram of feathers."
Response:  We know that the current amount of wax is 11g and the feathers require 492g of wax in total. So we need to find out how many grams of wax are needed for each feather. Let's assume that the number of feathers is x. Then, the amount of wax needed per feather is: 11g / 492g = 0.0225x grams. Therefore, the next amount of wax needed is: 0.0225x + 11g.
Response:  If there are 94 beggars and they can fill 90 barrels of grapes in 6 days, that means each beggar can fill 15 barrels per day (90/94). So, if one person fills 15 barrels per day, then he will fill 3 barrels per hour (15/4), and 1 barrel every 2 hours (3/2). Therefore, for one day, this person will fill 2 barrels (1/2).
Response:  If there are 266 beggars and they can fill 90 barrels of grapes in 5 days, then each day they will be able to fill how many barrels?  We know that 1/266 = 0.0378 (approximately) so each day they will be able to fill approximately 37.8 barrels.
Response:  We know that there are 294 people who will be picking grapes at the last stop and they will fill 244 sundries of grapes per day. So, in total, they will fill 244 x 146 = 35080 sundries of grapes during the period of 146 days. Now, we need to find out how many sundries of grapes will be filled by each person. Therefore, divide the total number of sundries of grapes by the number of people picking grapes: 35080 / 294 = 120.5 sundries of grapes per person per day.
Response:  If there are 221 sudes of grapes and they fill 77 days, then each day will have how many sudes of grapes?  So, the number of sudes of grapes per day is 221 / 77 = 2.9 Sudes of grapes per day.
"Response:  If he spends 57 days controlling grapes at his favorite vineyard and there are 252 grape pickers who fill 108 barrels of grapes per day, then we can calculate how many barrels will be filled in 58 days as follows:

Barrels filled per day = Number of grape pickers x Amount of grapes picked per day
= 252 x 108
= 26,944 barrels

So, if it takes 58 days to complete the task, then the total number of barrels filled will be:
Total barrels filled = Number of barrels filled per day x Number of days taken to complete the task
= 26,944 x 58
= 1,537,632 barrels"
Response:  If there are 36 beggars who fill up 8 jugs of grapes per day, then in one day they will fill up 36 x 8 = 288 jugs of grapes. To find out how many days it will take to fill up 240 jugs of grapes, we can divide 240 by 288: 240 / 288 = 81 days. Therefore, it will take 81 days for the 36 beggars to fill up 240 jugs of grapes.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium has the same number of saltwater animals as there are total saltwater animals in all the aquariums. So, we can write an equation:  Number of saltwater animals in one aquarium = Total number of saltwater animals / Number of aquariums  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of saltwater animals in one aquarium = 52 saltwater animals / 26 aquariums  Number of saltwater animals in one aquarium = 2 (approximately) Therefore, each aquarium has approximately 2 saltwater animals.
Response:  We know that there are 40 slaných vodních zvířat in total and each aquarium has 2 zvířata. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of fish / Number of fish per aquarium.

Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater and 10 aquariums for freshwater. Each aquarium contains 39 animals. So, we can calculate as follows: Saltwater aquariums = 56 x 39 = 2174 Freshwater aquariums = 10 x 39 = 390 Total number of animals = 2174 + 390 = 2564 Therefore, Tyler has 2564 saltwater and freshwater animals in total.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Each aquarium contains 46 animals. So, we can calculate as follows: Total number of animals in all aquariums = Number of freshwater aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium + Number of saltwater aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Therefore, the total number of animals in all aquariums is: 74 x 46 + 22 x 46 = 3580 animals.
"Response:  If there are 15 aquariums for saltwater and each has 19 fish, then we have:

15 x 19 = 285 fish in total for saltwater aquariums.
If there are 62 aquariums for freshwater and each has 19 fish, then we have:

62 x 19 = 1178 fish in total for freshwater aquariums.
In total, there are 285 + 1178 = 1463 fish."
Response:  If white t-shirts can be bought in packs of 13 pieces, then we know that one pack contains 13 t-shirts. So if Mama buys 39 white t-shirts, she will buy 39 / 13 = 3 packs of t-shirts. Therefore, Mama will have 3 packs of t-shirts.
Response:  We know that Mama will buy 66 white t-shirts and each box contains 3 white t-shirts. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of boxes = Total number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts in each box  In this case, we have:  Number of boxes = 66 / 3 = 22 boxes  Therefore, there will be 22 boxes of white t-shirts.
Response:  If we have 28 packages of white t-shirts and each package contains 56 white t-shirts, then we can calculate how many white t-shirts are in one package as follows: Number of white t-shirts per package = Total number of white t-shirts / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 white t-shirts in each package.
Response:  If we have 53 white shirts in a package and Mama buys 57 packages of white shirts, then she will have 57 x 53 = 2913 white shirts.  And if she also buys 34 pairs of shorts, that means she has 2913 + 34 = 2947 pieces of clothing in total. So, there are 2947 white shirts.
"Response:  If we have 51 white shirts and we want to buy them in batches of three, then we will need:

51 / 3 = 17 batches
So, there will be 17 batches of white shirts."
Response:  If Máma wants to buy 70 white shirts and she buys them in packages of 14 each, then we can calculate how many white shirts are in each package as follows:  Number of white shirts per package = Total number of white shirts / Number of packages = 70 / 14 = 5.  So, there are 5 white shirts in each package that Máma bought.
Response:  If we have 4 baskets with the same number of dried persimmons and 36 dried persimmons in total, then each basket must contain 9 sundries (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  We have 33 sušenky and each bag has 11 sušenek. To find out how many bags we have, we can divide the total number of sušenek by the number in each bag: 33 / 11 = 3 bags. So, we have 3 bags of sušenek.

Therefore, you have 7 containers with dried fruits."
Response:  We have 26 bags with equal number of sweets. If we have 15 candies and 52 sweets in one bag, then we can calculate how many bags we have based on the total number of sweets. So, if we divide the total number of sweets (52) by the number of sweets in each bag (52), we get 1 bag. Therefore, you have 1 pytel of sweets.
Response:  We have 14 bags with equal number of sweets. So we have 14 x Number of sweets in one bag = Total number of sweets.  Since there are 28 sweets and 86 candies, total number of sweets is 28 + 86 = 114. Therefore, you have 114 bags of sweets.
"Response:  If there are n houses in each block and P letters were sent to each house, then the total number of letters sent is equal to the product of n and P. Therefore, if 25 letters were sent to each house in a block with n houses per block, then the total number of letters sent would be:

$$ Total = n \times 25 $$

We know that the number of blocks is B, so we can write:

$$ Total = B \times n \times 25 $$

Now, we need to find out what value of n will satisfy this equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $B$:

$$ \frac{Total}{B} = \frac{n \times 25}{B} $$

Since we want to find the value of n, we can solve for it by isolating the variable n on the left-hand side of the equation:

$$ n = \frac{Total}{B} \times 25 $$

So, the value of n is:

$$ n = \frac{Total}{B} \times 25 $$

Therefore, the answer to the question is: The number of houses in each block is $\boxed{5}$."
Response:  We have to deliver 9 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every block. Since there are 20 houses in each block, we need to deliver 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of unwanted mail in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 180.
Response:  If there are six houses in one block and the postman needs to deliver 24 incomplete letters to each house, then he will need to deliver a total of 144 (24 x 6) incomplete letters to all the houses in the block. So, the number of incomplete letters that the postman must deliver to each house is 144 / 6 = 24.
"Response:  If Postař gives 14 unwanted letters to each house in a block, and he must give 2 pieces of unhealthy mail to each block, then we can calculate the number of houses in one block as follows:

Number of houses in one block = Number of unwanted letters given to each house x 2 unhealthy letters per block
= 14 unwanted letters x 2 unhealthy letters
= 28 houses in one block
Therefore, there are 28 houses in one block."
Response:  We have 20 homes in each block, so we need to deliver 32 incomplete letters to each of those blocks. Therefore, the total number of incomplete letters that must be delivered is:  32 x 20 = 640.
Response:  We know that the postman must deliver 30 pieces of unwanted mail to 78 blocks. Since each block has 19 homes, we can calculate how many pieces of unwanted mail the postman should give to each home as follows: Total number of pieces of unwanted mail = Number of blocks x Number of homes per block x Number of pieces of unwanted mail per home Total number of pieces of unwanted mail = 78 x 19 x 30 = 6420 pieces of unwanted mail Therefore, the postman should give 6420 pieces of unwanted mail to each home in the 78 blocks.
Response:  We know that there are 55 blocks in total and each block has 8 houses. So, the number of houses is 55 x 8 = 440. Now we have to find out how many emails were sent to each house. According to the question, 32 emails were sent to each house in each block, so the total number of emails sent is 32 x 440 = 14,640.
Response:  We have to deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every block among 81 blocks. Since there are 12 houses in each block, we need to give 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of unwanted mail in total. Therefore, the answer is 48.
Response:  We have to deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every block. Since there are 16 blocks, we need to deliver a total of 4 x 16 = 64 pieces of unwanted mail. So, the correct answer is 64.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 pebbles. If she wants to divide them into four groups, we need to find out how many pebbles each group will get so that there are an equal number of pebbles in each group.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one quantity by another to find out how many groups you can make. In this case, we want to divide 20 pebbles by 4 to see how many groups we can make.  So, if we divide 20 by 4, we get 5. This means that Rebecca can divide her pebbles into 5 different groups. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We have 10 kuliček and 15 vajec. If we want to divide them into groups of 5 each, how many groups can we make? To find out, let's divide 10 (the number of kuliček) by 5 (the number of kuliček in each group):

$$ \divide{10}{5} = 2 $$
So, we can make 2 groups with 5 kuliček each. Now, let's see how many vajec are left over after dividing the kuliček into groups:

$$ \divide{15}{2} = 7 $$
So, there will be 7 vajec left over after making 2 groups with 5 kuliček each. Therefore, the answer is $2$ groups."
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the collection of eggs into groups of 11 each, she will need 11 x 2 = 22 eggs in total. So, Rebecca has 22 eggs.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and 6 marbles. If we want to divide them into 4 groups of equal size, how many eggs will each group have?  To find out, let's divide 8 by 4: 8 / 4 = 2. So each group will have 2 eggs. Now, how many marbles will be left over after dividing the eggs equally among the groups? Let's count the number of marbles that will go with each group: 6 - (2 x 6) = 6. So there will be 6 marbles left over after dividing the eggs equally among the groups.
Response:  We have 15 eggs and we want to divide them into three groups. So, we need to find out how many eggs each group will get.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to find out how many groups you can make. In this case, we are dividing 15 eggs by 3 groups.  So, if we divide 15 by 3, we get 5. That means each group will get 5 eggs. Therefore, the answer is 5 eggs per group.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of six. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide 18 by 6:

18 / 6 = 3
So Rebecca can make 3 groups of six eggs each.
Now let's check if our calculation is correct. According to the problem statement, Rebecca also has 72 bananas and 66 kuliček (or raisins). If we assume that these are additional items that Rebecca wants to include in her groupings, then we can calculate their distribution as follows:

* Bananas: Since there are 72 bananas, Rebecca can distribute them equally among the three groups, giving each group 24 bananas.
* Kuličky: Similarly, since there are 66 kuliček, Rebecca can distribute them equally among the three groups, giving each group 22 kuliček.

So now we have calculated the number of groups Rebecca can make based on the information provided in the question:

Groups of eggs: 3
Group size for eggs: 6 eggs per group
Total number of eggs: 18 eggs

And here are the calculations for the other items:

Bananas: Total number of bananas = 72 bananas / 3 groups = 24 bananas per group
Kuličky: Total number of kuliček = 66 kuliček / 3 groups = 22 kuliček per group

Therefore, the answer to the question is 3 groups."
Response:  We have to divide the total number of objects into groups of three.  Total number of objects = 99 + 9 + 27 = 135. Since we want to divide them into groups of three, we will make 45 groups (135 / 3 = 45). So there will be 45 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. If she divides the eggs into groups of 5 each, how many groups can she make?  To find out, we divide 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4. So, Rebecca can make 4 groups of 5 eggs each. Now, let's count how many eggs are left after dividing them into groups: 20 - (4 x 5) = 20 - 20 = 0. That means all 20 eggs were used up in making the 4 groups! As for the marbles, Rebecca has 6 of them, so there is no need to divide them into groups since she doesn't have enough to make more than one group. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these numbers. To do this, we will use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 12 (the number of eggs) by 5 (the number of marbles). When we divide 12 by 5, we get 2. This means that for every 5 marbles, Rebecca has 2 more eggs than marbles. So if she has 5 marbles, she has 7 eggs (since 5 x 2 = 10, and 10 - 5 = 7). Therefore, Rebecca has 7 eggs more than marbles.
"Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in total and he got 11 points per round, then we can calculate how many rounds he played as follows:

Total score = Number of rounds x Score per round
= 154 points x 11 points/round
= 1760 points

So, Luke played 1760 / 11 = 160 rounds."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 trivia games and scored 46 points in each game, then he scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$

where $x_i$ is the number of points Luke scored in the $i^{th}$ game, which we are told is 46. Therefore, we can write:

$$ \begin{align\*}
\text {Total score} &= \sum_{i=1}^{177} 46 \\
&= 177 \times 46 \\
&= 8232 \end{align\*} $$

So, Luke scored a total of 8232 points in all 177 games combined."
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points in two rounds of trivia game and he got the same number of points in each round, then we can write an equation as follows:  Points = Number of Rounds x Score per Round  In this case, if Luke scored 84 points in total, then the score per round is equal to $ \frac{84}{2} = 42$ points. Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in each round.
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of the game, then he would have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,982 points in the entire game.
Response:  If Luke played $n$ rounds and scored $b_n$ points in each round, then his total score after $n$ rounds is given by $\sum_{k=1}^n b_k$. Since he scored 3 points in each round, we have $b_k = 3^k$, so $\sum_{k=1}^n 3^k = 78$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \log_3(78) \approx 9$. Therefore, Luke played $9$ rounds of trivia.
Response:  If Emily had 2 coral pieces and could make 32 necklaces, then she must have used each piece to make half of those necklaces (since there are only 4 possible combinations for 2 pieces). So, each coral piece was used to make 16 necklaces. Therefore, each necklace required 1/2 = 8 coral pieces.
Response:  We know that Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace has 28 beads. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of beads = Total number of beads / Number of necklaces  In this case, the total number of beads is 28 x 11 = 308 beads. Since there are 11 necklaces, we divide the total number of beads by 11 to get the number of beads in each necklace: Number of beads per necklace = 308 beads / 11 necklaces = 27.5 beads per necklace Now, let's round up the result to the nearest whole number: Number of beads per necklace = 28 beads per necklace Therefore, Emily had 28 beads in each of her 11 necklaces, for a total of 28 x 11 = 308 beads.
"Response:  If Emily has 16 coral reefs and she wants to make necklaces for her friends, each of which contains 8 coral reefs, then we can calculate how many necklaces she can make as follows:

= 2

Therefore, Emily can make 2 necklaces using all of her coral reefs."
Response:  If Emily made 18 na...
Response:  We know that Emily made four na...
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 coral pieces and she wants to make necklaces for her 72 friends. Since each necklace requires 3 coral pieces, we can calculate how many necklaces Emily can make as follows: Number of necklaces = Total number of coral pieces / Number of coral pieces per necklace So, in this case, the total number of coral pieces is 6 (given), and the number of coral pieces per necklace is 3 (also given). Therefore, the number of necklaces Emily can make is: Number of necklaces = 6 / 3 = 2  So, Emily can make 2 necklaces using all of her 6 coral pieces.
Response:  If Emily has 5 coral pieces and she can make 20 necklaces, then each necklace requires 5/20 = 1/4 of a coral piece. So, one coral piece is needed to make 4 necklaces.
Response:  We know that Emily made 26 necklaces and each necklace has 2 pearls. So, in total, Emily had to make 2 x 26 = 52 pearls.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County who go to camp during summer vacation and another 668278 children who stay at home. To find out how many children spend more time in camp than those who stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stay at home from the total number of children who go to camp. So, the answer is:  Number of children spending more time in camp = Total number of children going to camp - Number of children staying at home = 819058 - 668278 = 150780.
Response:  We know that there are 10,000 children in total (Lawrence County + other areas). Of those, 7,776 children went to camp and 2,224 stayed home. So, the number of children who stayed home is greater than the number of children who went to camp. Therefore, the answer is 2,224 - 7,776 = -5,552.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in Lawrence county and during summer vacation 629424 children go to camp. So we need to find out how many children will stay at home. To do this, we can divide the total number of children by the number of children who go to camp:  Number of children remaining at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp  Number of children remaining at home = 898051 - 629424  Number of children remaining at home = 268627  Therefore, 268627 children will remain at home in Lawrence county during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in Lawrence County and during summer vacation, 274865 will stay at home while the rest (274865) will go to camp. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Children who will stay at home. Therefore, the answer is 274865.
Response:  We know that out of 907611 children in Lawrence County, 455682 will go to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who will stay at home as follows: Number of children who will stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who will go to camp Total number of children = 907611 Children = 455682 Children who will go to camp = 455682 Children who will stay at home = 907611 - 455682 = 452039
Response:  We know that 8000 children go to camp during summer vacation and Lawrence county has 828521 children in total. So we can calculate how many children stayed at home as follows: Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp Now we have: Number of children who stayed at home = 828521 - 8000 = 748521 children remained at home.
Response:  We know that out of 91676 children in Lawrence County, only 61619 stayed at home during summer vacation. So, the number of children who went to camp is equal to the total number of children minus those who stayed at home. Therefore, we can write: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 61619 Number of children who went to camp = 30057  Therefore, according to the given information, approximately 30057 children from Lawrence County went to summer camp.
Response:  We know that out of 57,438 children in Lawrence County, 34,044 go to camp and 13,486 stay at home. This means there are 42,494 children left from the surrounding area who attended camp. Therefore, the number of children who attended camp is 42,494.
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children in Lawrence County, 608543 will go to camp and 22 will participate in the camp from nearby areas. So, the number of children who are in Lawrence County is: 608543 + 22 = 608765
Response:  We know that out of 644 997 children in Lawrence County, 893 835 went to camp and 78 from the surrounding area also attended camp. So, we need to find the number of children who stayed at home. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County:  Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp  Number of children who stayed at home = 644 997 - 893 835  Number of children who stayed at home = 251 162  Therefore, there are 251 162 children who stayed at home in Lawrence County during the summer vacation.
Response:  If Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total, then Jackie must have 6 apples (since 3 + 6 = 9). Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we can subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:  9 (Adam) - 10 (Jackie) = -1. Therefore, Jackie has one fewer apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jackie has and the number of apples Adam has is:  10 - 8 = 2. So, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 6 apples.  If Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie must have 2 apples. So, in total, Adam has 6 + 4 = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 apples and Jackie has 4 apples, so together they have 7 apples (3 + 4 = 7). Now we are asked how many more apples Adam has than Jackie. To find this out, we subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the total number of apples Adam has: 3 (Adam's apples) - 4 (Jackie's apples) = 9 (difference between Adam's and Jackie's apple count). So, Adam has 9 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 12 apples and Jackie has 9 apples less than Adam. So, Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie. Therefore, the number of apples Adam has is 12 + 3 = 15.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 4 apples and less than 10 apples. So, he must have 6-4 = 2 apples. Since Adam and Jackie together have 2 + 2 = 4 apples, we can conclude that Adam has 2 - 4 = -2 apples. Therefore, Adam does not have any apple.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 5 apples. Now we are given that Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples. Therefore, the total number of fruits that Jackie has is 89 + 11 = 100. Since Adam has more apples than Jackie, he must have fewer apples than 100. So, Adam has 100 - (x + 5) = 100 - x - 5 = 45 apples.
Response:  Yesterday (včera), Helen made 31 sundaes. Today (dnes), she made 270 more sundaes, which means she made in total 270 + 31 = 301 sundaes today. And tomorrow (předevčírem), she will make 419 more sundaes, so the total number of sundaes Helen has made until now is 301 + 419 = 720 sundaes.
Response:  We know that Helen peeled off 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 with sprinkles today. So, she has peeled off in total 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate chip cookies. Now, we are asked how many chocolate suckers Helen peeled off. The information given is that Helen peeled off 484 chocolate suckers this morning. Therefore, the number of chocolate suckers Helen peeled off is 484 - 141 = 343.
Response:  If yesterday Helen peeled 527 chocolate chip cookies and 86 with raisins, then today she peeled 86 chocolate chip cookies and 554 more chocolate chip cookies. So in total, Helen peeled 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen peeled off 144 chocolate-covered raisins and 397 raisins with nuts yesterday. Today, she peeled off 85 raisins with nuts and 403 chocolate-covered raisins. So, in total, Helen peeled off 1268 sundries (raisins + chocolate-covered raisins). Now we need to find out how many hazelnut sundries Helen peeled off. Since there are 1268 sundries in total, and 397 of them were raisins with nuts, then the number of hazelnut sundries is 1268 - 397 = 871. Therefore, Helen peeled off 871 hazelnut sundries.
Response:  We know that Helen peeled off 19 chocolate wafers yesterday and 231 with sprinkles today. So in total she peeled off 250 chocolate wafers (19 + 231). Now we need to find out how many more chocolate wafers Helen peeled off than raisin rolls. According to the problem, Helen made 237 chocolate wafers this morning. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate wafers and raisin rolls is:  237 - 231 = 6. So, Helen peeled off 6 more chocolate wafers than raisin rolls.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and 46 with sprinkles. Today, she baked 75 chocolate cookies and 66 with sprinkles. So, yesterday, Helen baked more chocolate cookies than today. The difference is: 197 - 75 = 122. Therefore, Helen baked 122 more chocolate cookies yesterday than today.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 300 suckers with raisins and today she made 280 suckers with raisins. So, yesterday she made 120 more suckers with raisins than today. Therefore, the number of suckers with raisins that Helen made yesterday is 120.

81 - 59 = 22

So, Katie has 22 more DS games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie had 91 DS games and her new friends had 88 games. So, together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now, we are asked how many games Katie's older friends had. According to the passage, their number is half of the total number of games that Katie and her new friends had, which is 179. Therefore, the number of games that Katie's older friends had was 179 / 2 = 89 games. Finally, we add up the number of games that Katie and her new friends had (179) with the number of games that Katie's older friends had (89), which gives us the total number of games that Katie's friends had, i.e., 179 + 89 = 268 games. So, the answer is 268.
Response:  We know that Katie had 78 new games and 86 old games, for a total of 164 games. Her friends had 48 new games, so together they have 164 + 48 = 212 games.
Response:  We know that Katie had 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19 = 103).  Her friends had 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69 = 77).  Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77 = 180).
Response:  We know that Katie had 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 62 + 80 = 142 games. Her friends had 73 new games and 41 old games, so they have a total of 73 + 41 = 114 games. Therefore, Katie has more old games than her friends.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games together. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has:

63 - 57 = 6

So, Katie has 6 more games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Her friends have 34 new games, which means they also have a total number of games equal to their combined number of new and old games. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends. So, the correct answer is:  Katie has 96 games, while her friends have 68 games (34 + 34 = 68).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $19 dollars before he cleaned the car and afterward, he has $33 dollars. So, the difference between his initial amount of money and the final amount is equal to the amount he earned from cleaning the car. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  $33 = $19 + x  Where 'x' represents the amount of money Jason earned from cleaning the car. Now, we are given that Fred had $60 dollars initially, so we can substitute this value in the above equation as follows:  $33 = $19 + ($60 - $19)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  $33 = $41  Divide both sides of the equation by $41 to find out how much Jason earned from cleaning the car:  $33 / $41 = x  Therefore, Jason earned $8 from cleaning the car.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 last week and spent $20 on gas. So he has $66 left. Then, we know that Jason had $5 last week and didn't work this week either. Therefore, his money remains unchanged at $5. Now, let's calculate how much they have together: Fred has $66 + $5 = $71, so they have a total of $71 between them.
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 last week and made $21 this week (40 - 19 = 21). So, Fred earned $21 more than he had last week. Similarly, we know that Jason had $16 last week and made $43 this week (69 - 16 = 53). So, Jason earned $53 more than he had last week. Now, let's find out how much money each person earned individually:  Fred earned $21 + $21 = $42 more than last week.  Jason earned $53 + $21 = $74 more than last week. Therefore, Fred earned $42 during the weekend, and Jason earned $74 during the weekend.
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 last week and now he has $21. So, his loss is $93 ($114 - $21). Now we know that Jason had $22 last week and now he has $78. So, his gain is $56 ($22 + $78). Therefore, Jason made $56 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 last week and after he mowed lawns for $65, he now has $176 ($111 + $65). Secondly, we know that Jason had $40 last week and after he delivered newspapers for $20, he now has $60 ($40 + $20). Finally, we are told that Fred made $115 from mowing lawns and Jason made $60 from delivering newspapers. So, the total amount of money earned from these activities is $175 ($115 + $60). Therefore, the answer is $175.
Response:  We know that Fred had $49 last week and after he sold his car over the weekend, he now has $112. So, he earned $63 from selling his car. Now, we know that Jason had $3 last week and after delivering newspapers, he now has $63. Therefore, Jason earned $50 from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 and after delivering newspapers he got $14, so his new amount is $45 ($31 + $14).  Next, we know that Fred had $78 and after washing cars over the weekend, he got $90, so his new amount is $168 ($78 + $90).  Now, let's find out how much money they earned from delivering newspapers. We can do this by subtracting Jason's old amount from his new amount: $45 - $31 = $14. So, Jason earned $14 from delivering newspapers.  Similarly, we can calculate Fred's earnings as follows: $168 - $78 = $90. So, Fred earned $90 from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 last week and Jason had $95 last week.  Secondly, we know that Fred delivered newspapers for $16 over the weekend and mowed lawns for $74 over the weekend. So, how much money did Fred make in total? Well, if he made $16 from delivering newspapers and $74 from mowing lawns, then he made a total of $90 ($16 + $74). Therefore, Fred made $90 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and Jason had $99 last week.  Then, Fred delivered newspapers for $111 over the weekend and mowed lawns for $34 during the week. So, his total earnings are: $47 + $99 + $111 = $257. Therefore, Fred has $257 now.
Response:  If Jessie originally weighed 71 kg and then lost 20 kg through running every day, she now weighs 51 kg (71 - 20 = 51).
Response:  We know that Jessie currently weighs 27 kg and has lost 101 kg through running. So, her original weight was:  Original weight = Current weight - Lost weight = 27 kg - 101 kg = -74 kg Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed -74 kg.
Response:  When Jessie started running every day, she lost 126 kg. Now, she weighs 66 kg. So, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 192 kg (126 + 66).
Response:  We know that Jessie started running every day and lost 35 kg. So, her weight before starting to run was 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg. Therefore, she currently weighs 34 kg.
Response:  In the first week (t = 1), Jessie lost 50 kg, so she weighed 114 - 50 = 64 kg.  In the second week (t = 2), she lost another 60 kg, so she now weighs 64 - 60 = 8 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 8 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie currently weighs 9 kg and has lost weight during her two weeks of running. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, which means she started at a higher weight than her current weight (9 kg). So, before starting to run, Jessie must have weighed more than 9 + 62 = 73 kg. Therefore, Jessie originally weighed 73 kg before beginning her running routine.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie initially weighed 92 kg. Then, in the first week of running, she lost 56 kg, so her new weight became 92 - 56 = 36 kg. In the second week, she lost another 99 kg, bringing her total loss to 105 kg (99 + 36). Therefore, after two weeks of running, Jessie would have weighed 92 - 105 = -13 kg.
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 wolves and 61 alligators in the zoo. If 64 wolves hid themselves, then we need to find out how many wolves are left after they hid themselves. So, let W be the number of wolves that hid themselves. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of wolves = Initial number of wolves - Number of wolves that hid themselves (W) Now, we are asked to find out how many wolves will hide themselves if there are 64 wolves in total. So, we substitute W with 64 in the above equation: Number of wolves = Initial number of wolves - Number of wolves that hid themselves (64) Solving for W, we get: W = Number of wolves - Initial number of wolves (95) Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get: Number of wolves = 95 - 64 = 31 Therefore, 31 wolves hid themselves in the zoo.
Response:  We know that there were initially 93 hands and 97 alligators in the enclosure. If 40 alligators hid themselves, then we have to subtract 40 from both numbers of hands and alligators. So, after hiding, there will be: Hands = 93 - 40 = 53 And Alligators = 97 - 40 = 57
Response:  We know that initially there were 75 alligators and 3 snakes in the enclosure. If we add 82 snakes to the enclosure, then the total number of snakes will be:  Number of initial snakes = 3 + 75 = 78 Additional snakes = 82 - 75 = 7 New total number of snakes = 78 + 7 = 85 Therefore, 75 aligatores were hidden.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 animals in total in the enclosure. If we add 24 snakes and 51 alligators to this number, we get:  
Total = 79 + 24 = 103  
So, there were 103 animals in the enclosure."
"Response:  If the farmer had 171 tomatoes and he picked 134 yesterday and 30 today, then we need to find out how many tomatoes are left for him after today. We can do this by subtracting the number of tomatoes he picked from the total number of tomatoes he had:

Number of tomatoes left = Total number of tomatoes - Number of tomatoes picked
= 171 - (134 + 30)
= 171 - 164
= 7
So, there are 7 tomatoes left for the farmer after today."
Response:  If the farmer had 160 radishes in his garden and yesterday he picked 56, then he has 160 - 56 = 104 radishes left in his garden today.
Response:  If the farmer had 90 tomatoes yesterday and today he picked up 50, then the total number of tomatoes he has now is: 90 + 50 = 140. So, the farmer picked up 140 tomatoes in two days.
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 rajčat and 77 brambor. If he picked 172 brambors, then he left with 3 brambors (172 - 77 = 95). Now, let's calculate how many rajčat he has left. He started with 175 rajčat, subtracted the number of brambors he picked (172), and what remains are his original rajčat: 175 - 172 = 3 rajčata. So, the farmer has 3 rajčata and 3 brambors left on his garden after picking 172 brambors.
Response:  The farmer had initially 177 radishes and 12 Brussels sprouts in his garden. If he picked 53 radishes, then we know that 123 radishes remained in the garden (177 - 53 = 123). Similarly, if he picked 12 Brussels sprouts, then we know that 108 Brussels sprouts remained in the garden (12 + 108 = 120). So, the farmer had 123 radishes and 108 Brussels sprouts left in his garden after picking 53 radishes and 12 Brussels sprouts.
"Response:  We know that the farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in total. If he picked 137 tomatoes, then we can calculate how many were left using subtraction:

Total number of tomatoes = 105 + 71 = 176
Number of tomatoes picked = 137

So, there are 176 - 137 = 49 tomatoes left on the farm after picking."
Response:  If each large wooden plate requires two nails, and John used four nails to cut through the plates for the wall, then he needs to cut 4/2 = 2 plates. Since there are 2 plates, John needs to cut 2 x 2 = 4 plates for the entire wall. Therefore, John needs to cut 4 plates for the wall.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 large wooden boards and each board requires 17 nails to be fixed. So, we need 249 nails (13 x 17 = 249). But then it says ""and also some smaller boards"". For these smaller boards, we don't know how many nails they require, but let's assume it's 8 nails per board, just like the larger boards. So, for the smaller boards, we need an additional 8 x number of smaller boards = 8 x x, where x is the number of smaller boards. Now, we add up all the nails needed: total nails = 249 + 8x = 249 + 8(x). Therefore, John needs 257 nails (249 + 8x) to fix the stucco on the house."
Response:  We know that pro used 11 chisels to cut large sheets of wood. Each sheet requires 3 chisels for fastening, so we need to multiply the number of sheets by 3 to get the total number of chisels needed for fastening. Then, we add the additional 8 chisels used for other purposes. Therefore, the total number of chisels required is:  Number of sheets x Number of chisels per sheet = 11 x 3 = 33 + 8 = 41 chisels. So, John needs 41 chisels to complete the job.
Response:  We know that big planks require 15 nails and small planks require 5 nails per row.  If we use 12 big planks and 10 small planks, then we need to calculate how many rows of small planks there are.  There are 12 / 10 = 1.2 rows of small planks. So, for each row of small planks, we need 5 x 1.2 = 6 hinges. Therefore, John needs 6 + 15 (for big planks) = 21 hinges in total.
Response:  We know that each desk needs two hinges for attachment and John is using 16 desks in total. So, we can calculate the number of hinges needed as follows: Number of hinges = Total number of desks x Number of hinges per desk  Number of hinges = 16 x 2  Number of hinges = 32 Therefore, John will need 32 hinges to attach all the desks to the wall.
Response:  If John used 8 large wooden boards to cover his house, and each board requires 74 nails, then we can calculate how many nails John needs as follows: Number of boards = 8 Desks per board = 1 Large wooden board = 74 Nails required for one board Total number of nails needed = Number of boards x Number of desks per board x Number of nails required for one desk Total number of nails needed = 8 x 1 x 74 = 592 nails Therefore, John needs 592 nails to cover his entire house with 8 large wooden boards.
Response:  We know that: * The total number of desks used is 12 (velké) + 17 (malé) = 39 desks. * Each large desk requires 14 hinges to be attached. Therefore, the number of hinges required for all large desks is 14 x 12 = 168 hinges. * Each small desk requires 25 hinges to be attached. So, the number of hinges needed for all small desks is 25 x 17 = 425 hinges. Now we need to find out how many nails are needed in total. To do this, we multiply the number of hinges by the number of nails required per hinge: 168 hinges x 14 nails/hinge = 2304 nails  So, John needs 2304 nails to attach all the desks to the wall.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of gum in total and each package has 3 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of packages = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per package  Number of packages = 42 / 3  Number of packages = 14 Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 bags of chocolates and in each bag there are 23 pieces of chocolate. So, the total number of pieces of chocolate Robin has is:  Number of bags = 43  Pieces per bag = 23  Total number of pieces =  Number of pieces Robin has = 43 x 23 = 1005 pieces.  Therefore, Robin has 1005 pieces of chocolate.
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. So, he has in total 6 + 6 = 12 pieces of gum. Since each bag contains 7 pieces of gum, we can calculate how many bags Robin has as follows: Number of pieces of gum per bag = 7 Total number of pieces of gum = 12 / 7 = 1.71 (approximately) Therefore, Robin has approximately 1.71 bags of gum.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of gum and 13 packages of candies. Since each package contains 4 pieces of gum or candy, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Gum: 28 packages x 4 pieces/package = 112 pieces Candy: 13 packages x 4 pieces/package = 52 pieces Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of gum and 52 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 bags of gummies and each bag contains 9 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of gummies = Total number of bags x Number of pieces per bag  In this case, the total number of bags is 21, and the number of pieces per bag is 9. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation to get: Number of gummies = 21 x 9 = 189 kousky  So, Robin has 189 pieces of gummi bears.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 bags of chocolates and 14 bags of sweets. Each bag contains six pieces. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Number of pieces of chocolate = 28 x 6 = 168 pieces Number of pieces of sweets = 14 x 6 = 84 pieces Total number of pieces = 168 + 84 = 252 pieces Therefore, Robin has 252 pieces in total.
Response:  We know that the industrial machine can produce 3 t-shirts per minute. In total, it produced 6 t-shirts. To find out how long the machine worked, we need to divide the number of t-shirts produced by the number of t-shirts produced per minute:  Number of minutes = Total number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts produced per minute  Number of minutes = 6 / 3  Number of minutes = 2 minutes  Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  If the industrial machine worked for 5 minutes and can produce 4 t-shirts per minute, then it produced 20 t-shirts in total (5 minutes x 4 t-shirts/minute). Therefore, the answer is 20 t-shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, he produced 9 triangles and today he produced 44 triangles. So, if three triangles are made per minute, then yesterday he worked for (44 - 9) = 35 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 35 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 13 trikes and today it produced 3 trikes. So, in total, the machine produced 16 trikes (13 + 3). Now we need to find out how many minutes the machine worked. We know that the machine produces 8 trikes per minute, so if we calculate the time taken to produce these 16 trikes, we get: Time = Number of trikes x Time per trike = 16 trikes x 1 minute/8 trikes = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machinery functioned for 2 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 9 trikes and today it produced 8 trikes. So, we can say that the difference between yesterday's production and today's production is equal to 1 trike. Therefore, the number of minutes worked by the machine today = Production per minute x Total time taken to produce one trike.  Production per minute = 2 tricks/minute (as given in the problem) Total time taken to produce one trike = We don't know as this information is not provided in the problem. So, we have to assume an average time taken to produce one trike which may be 5 minutes or any other value. Now, let's calculate the total time taken to produce 8 trikes. Time taken to produce 8 trikes = Number of trikes produced x Total time taken to produce one trike 8 trikes = 2 trikes/minute x? (we don't know the actual time taken to produce one trike) Substituting the values, we get, Time taken to produce 8 trikes = 2 trikes/minute x? = 16 minutes (assuming an average time taken to produce one trike is 5 minutes) Now, we need to find out how many minutes the machine worked today. Minutes worked by the machine today = Time taken to produce 8 trikes + Time taken to produce 7 trikes (yesterday)  Minutes worked by the machine today = 16 minutes +? (we don't know the actual time taken to produce 7 trikes yesterday) Substituting the values, we get, Minutes worked by the machine today = 16 minutes +? = 24 minutes (assuming an average time taken to produce one trike is 5 minutes yesterday also) Therefore, the machine worked for 24 minutes today.
Response:  If yesterday it produced 4 triangles per minute and today it produces 8 triangles per minute, then we can calculate how many minutes it worked as follows:  Yesterday - 4 triangles/minute x 60 minutes = 240 minutes  Today - 8 triangles/minute x 60 minutes = 480 minutes  Therefore, the machine worked for 480 minutes.
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 trikes per minute and yesterday it produced 12 minutes, then today it produces 14 trikes in 14 minutes. So, the total number of trikes produced is: 6 x 12 = 72 trikes yesterday + 14 x 14 = 196 trikes today = 268 trikes overall.
Response:  If yesterday the machine could produce 5 trikes per minute and today it can produce 12 trikes per minute, then we know that the increase in production is 12 - 5 = 7 trikes per minute. So, if the machine produced 7 trikes per minute yesterday, then it will produce 7 x 60 = 420 trikes today. Therefore, the number of trikes produced by the machine today is 420.
"Response:  We know that they earned $165 in total over 5 days. So, if they earned the same amount every day, we can write an equation as follows:

$165 = x \times 5

where x is the daily earnings.

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = $165 / 5

So, the daily earnings were $33."
Response:  The carnival earned $144 per day from the ring toss game. They were at the carnival for 22 days. So, how much did they earn in total? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount earned = Number of days x Amount earned per day Therefore, the total amount earned by the carnival is: Total amount earned = 22 days x $144 per day = $3,096 Now we have found out that the carnival earned $3,096 during their 22-day stay at the carnival.
Response:  We know that they earned $420 in total over 30 days and $22 together with playing the game. So we can write an equation as follows: Total amount = Daily earnings x Number of days + Amount earned from playing the game  Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total amount = $420 x 30 + $22  Simplifying the equation gives us: $1260 + $22 = $1282  Therefore, the ring toss game earned $82 per day.
Response:  First 44 days = $382 + $374 = $756 Total earnings for first 54 days = $756.
Response:  The total amount earned during the first 20 days of the carnival was $120 + $66 = $186. So, they earned $186 / 20 = $9.3 per day during the first 20 days.
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the first 154 days was $325, and during the remaining 57 days it was $114, for a total of $439. So, they earned $439 / 57 = $7.80 per day during the last 57 days of the carnival.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packages of snacks and 4 packages of cakes. So far, she has spent $10 + 4 = $14. Now we are asked how many more packages of snacks did Lucy buy? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of packages she already bought from 10. Therefore, the answer is 10 - 4 = 6 packages of snacks.
"Response: 
Lucy went to the store and bought:
* 4 packages of snacks (balení)
* 22 packages of cakes (balení)
* 16 packages of chocolate (balení)

So, in total, Lucy bought:
4 + 22 + 16 = 42 packages of food."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of snacks and some packages of cakes. So, she had a total of 27 packages of food. Since we know that each package of cake contains 4-6 pieces, let's assume that Lucy bought x packages of cakes, where x is an integer. Therefore, the number of pieces of cake that Lucy bought is equal to x \* 4 - 6 = 2x - 6. Now, since Lucy has a total of 27 packages of food, the number of pieces of cake that she bought must be equal to 27 / (2x - 6) = 15/x. So, if we want to find out how many packages of cakes Lucy bought, we can divide both sides of this equation by 15: x = 15/15 = 1. Therefore, Lucy bought one package of cakes.
"Response: 

Balíček sušenek = 2 x 30 = 60
Balíček dortů = 12 x 10 = 120
Total amount spent = 60 + 120 = 180
Remaining change = Total amount spent - 180 = -40
So, Lucy bought 180 packages of snacks and desserts in total."
"Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got off at the next stop, so now we have:

12 + 4 = 16

So, currently, there are 16 people in the bus."
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, another 12 people boarded and 3 got off. So, now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got on the bus. So, now there are 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got on the train, so now there are 19 people in the train (11 + 8 = 19).
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents and 676 people in total. To find out how many students were on the program, we need to subtract the number of adults from the total number of people. So, 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 students on the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents and 724 students at the event. Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is:  Parents + Students = 73 + 724 = 807. So, there were 807 people at the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in total. To find out how many students were present compared to parents, we need to divide the number of students who attended (521) by the number of parents who attended (174). So, the ratio of students to parents is 521/174 = 3.01. Therefore, there were approximately 3 times as many students as parents in attendance at the event.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in total. The number of places (m) is given as 44. So we can set up an equation: Number of people at the event = Number of places x Number of people per place. In this case, one person takes up one place, so we have: Number of people at the event = 44 x Number of people per place. Now we need to find out how many people fit into each place. From the information provided earlier, we know that there were 177 students and 61 parents attending the event. If we divide these numbers by the number of places available (44), we get: Number of people per place = 177/44 = 3.95 people per place. Now we can plug this value back into our original equation to solve for the total number of people at the event: Total number of people at the event = Number of places x Number of people per place = 44 x 3.95 = 170.2 people. Therefore, there were approximately 170.2 people at the event.
Response:  If they need to travel 1307 stops from the end of the cave and the cave is 919 stops deep, then we can calculate the distance as follows: Distance = Depth x Number of Stops + End Point Distance = 919 x 1307 + 1307 = 124658 + 1307 = 126005 steps away from the end of the cave. Therefore, the end of the cave is 126005 steps away from where they are now.
Response:  The distance traveled so far is given as 849 stops, and they are moving at a speed of 17 stops per minute. To find out how far they will be when they reach the end of the cave, we need to calculate the time it takes them to reach the end. We know that there are 60 seconds in one minute, so: Time = Distance / Speed = 849 stops / 17 stops/minute = 50 minutes. Therefore, they will still be 50 minutes away from the end of the cave when they arrive.
Response:  We know that the distance from the entrance to the point where the tunnel is 659 feet long is 659 feet.  And we also know that the depth of the cave is 762 feet. So if we subtract the length of the tunnel from the depth of the cave, we get the remaining distance until they reach the end of the cave. Therefore, the remaining distance until they reach the end of the cave is 762 - 659 = 83 feet.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 goldfish in total (6 from the pond and 6 from Paige's jar). Then, 3 goldfish disappeared (according to the passage), leaving 9 goldfish remaining (6 from the pond + 3 from Paige's jar). Therefore, the number of goldfish that disappeared is 3.
Response:  We know that Paige caught 7 goldfish and 12 minnows in the pond. If the cats ate some of them, then we have to subtract their number from the total amount of fish she had. So, if the cats ate 4 goldfish (as given in the problem), then Paige has 3 goldfish left (7 - 4 = 3). Similarly, if the cats ate 6 minnows (also as given in the problem), then Paige has 6 minnows left (12 - 6 = 6). Therefore, the number of missing fish is equal to the number of fish eaten by the cats, which is 4 + 6 = 10. So, there are 10 missing fish.
Response:  We know that Paige caught 16 goldfish and 71 minnows in the pond. If the cats ate some of them, we don't know how many exactly. So let's assume that they ate half of the goldfish (8) and quarter of the minnows (18). Now we have to calculate how much goldfish are left after the cats ate their share. To do this, we need to subtract the number of goldfish eaten from the total number of goldfish caught: 16 - 8 = 8 goldfish left. Therefore, there are 8 goldfish left in the pond now.
Response:  We know that Paige caught 15 goldfish in the pond and that 5 of them were eaten by cats. To find out how many goldfish are left, we need to subtract the number of fish eaten by cats from the total number of fish caught. So, if 5 goldfish were eaten by cats, then 10 (15 - 5) goldfish are left. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  The chef had initially 43 apples and used two of them to make the pies. So, he has 43 - 2 = 41 apples left.
Response:  We know that one baker had 58 apples and used 35 of them to make pies. So, we have 23 apples left with the baker.
Response:  The chef had 40 jablkes and 54 bruskuvi. When he made the colačeks, he used up 39 of them. So, the number of jabłecks left is 40 - 39 = 1. Therefore, the chef used 1 jabłek to make the koláče.
Response:  If Adam has 4 policí and each police can hold 3 action figures (according to the question), then he can have a total of 4 x 3 = 12 action figures per police. Since his room has 4 policí and 40 shelves, he can have a total of 4 x 12 = 48 action figures in his room.
Response:  If Adam has 10 action figures in each of his pockets and he has 8 action figures in his pocket, then he has a total of 10 x 8 = 80 action figures in all his pockets. So, his pocket had 80 - 8 = 72 action figures.
Response:  If Adam can place 8 figures and 10 sculptures in his room, that means he has space for 8 + 10 = 18 objects in total. Since each policeman has 4 spaces, Adam can fit 18 / 4 = 4.5 objects per policeman. So, in total, Adam can fit 4.5 x 4 = 18 objects in his room.
"Response:  We know that in each garden there are 544 flowers and we want to find out how many flowers there are altogether. So let's divide the number of flowers in one garden (544) by the number of gardens (10):

Number of flowers in all gardens = Number of flowers in one garden x Number of gardens
= 544 x 10
= 5440

So, there are 5440 flowers altogether."
Response:  We know that there are 466 hours in total and each hour has 53 flowers and 181 holes. So, we can calculate as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of hours x Number of flowers per hourTotal number of holes = Number of hours x Number of holes per hourNow, let's convert both quantities to their respective units:Flowers: Hours x Flowers/Hour = 466 x 53 = 24,970Flowers: Holes/Hour x Hours = 181 x 466 = 86,966So, there are approximately 24,970 flowers and 86,966 holes in the given area.
Response:  We know that there are 141 pots and each pot has 71 flowers and 91 stems. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers per pot Total number of stems = Number of pots x Number of stems per pot Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9671 Total number of stems = 141 x 91 = 12591 Therefore, there are 9671 flowers and 12591 stems in total.
Response:  We know that each jar has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of jars = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per jar. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of jars = 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 jars.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 pieces of gum in total. If we divide them into groups of 154, then each group will have how many Skittles and how many pieces of gum?  To find out, let's use division!  Division is like sharing something equally among a certain number of people or groups. In this case, we want to share the Skittles and gum equally among 154 groups. So, if we divide 4502 Skittles by 154, we get... (division) 4502 / 154 = 29  Therefore, each group will have 29 Skittles. Now, let's calculate how many pieces of gum each group will have. If we divide 4276 pieces of gum by 154 groups, we get... (division) 4276 / 154 = 28  Therefore, each group will have 28 pieces of gum. So, the size of each group is 29 Skittles and 28 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 pieces of gum. If we divide the number of Skittles by the number of gum pieces, we get: Number of groups = Total number of items / Number of gum pieces = 3941 / 4950 = 7.8 groups So, each group contains approximately 7.8 Skittles or 7 gum pieces.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and Steven has 517 pieces of gum. So, we have a total of 896 + 517 = 1413 candies. Now, if we divide this number by 8 (the number of groups), we get 1413 / 8 = 176 candies per group. Therefore, each group contains 176 Skittles.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in the school.
Response:  If there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students, then we have:  Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class  So, in this case, we can write:  Number of students = 304 x 75  Number of students = 22,600  Therefore, there were 22,600 students in total at the school.
