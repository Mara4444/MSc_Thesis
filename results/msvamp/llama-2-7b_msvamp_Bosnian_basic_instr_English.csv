Response: 45 in (inches)
"Response: 10 inch
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the frog (žaba) is 32 inches more than the distance traveled by the squirrel (štakor). Therefore, if the squirrel traveled 25 inches, then the frog traveled 32 + 25 = 57 inches. Since the mouse (miš) traveled 26 inches less than the frog, the mouse traveled 57 - 26 = 31 inches."
Response: 10 inch (33 - 24 = 9)
Response:  Žaba je skočila 20 inča (20 cm).
Response: 45 in (35 + 10)
"Response: 40 cm
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance that the frog jumped is given as 40 cm (not 30 cm or 50 cm). This can be calculated by adding the distances that the snake and mouse jumped: 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm."
"Response: 47 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the stork jumped 39 inches and then jumped an additional 19 inches beyond the frog. This means that the stork jumped a total of 58 inches (39 + 19). Since the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, the mouse jumped 47 inches (58 - 12)."
Response:  The frog jumped 34 inches (21 + 25). Therefore, the mouse jumped 17 inches (16 - 34).
Response: 22 inch (39 - 17)
"Response: 7 cm
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, we know that the distance traveled by the frog (žaba) is 20 cm more than the distance traveled by the mouse (miš). We also know that the distance traveled by the snake (štakor) is 15 cm less than the distance traveled by the mouse. Therefore, if the mouse has traveled x cm, then the distance traveled by the snake is equal to -x + 15 = 7 cm. So, the answer is 7 cm."
"Response: 20 inch
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the frog (37 inches) is greater than the distance traveled by the mouse (16 inches). Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is equal to 37 - 16 = 21 inches. So, the mouse skated 21 inches away from the starting point."

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Zima je skoro tu"" which means winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer climates. It also mentions that 19 bird families live near a mountain. If 60 of these birds migrated for winter, then there are 34 more bird families that stayed behind."
"Response: 109

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Zima je skoro tu"" which means winter is almost here and many animals are migrating to warmer climates. It also mentions that 87 families of birds live near the mountain. If 7 families of birds have migrated for the winter, then there are 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds left behind. Therefore, there are more families of birds remaining in the area than those that have migrated away for the winter."
Response: 34 (20 - 14 = 34)
"Response: 160

"Response: 56

Explanation:
According to the passage, almost all animals migrate to warmer climates during winter, and 38 bird families live near Mount Everest. If 47 bird families went to Africa and 94 bird families went to Asia, then more bird families went to Asia than those that went to Africa. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that went to Asia and the number of bird families that went to Africa is equal to 56 (i.e., 94 - 47 = 56)."
"Response: 256
Explanation: According to the passage, almost all animals migrate to warmer climates during winter, and 18 bird families live near a mountain. If 38 bird families went to Africa and 80 bird families went to Asia, then the total number of bird families that migrated is 38 + 80 = 118. Since there are only 18 bird families living near the mountain, the remaining 100 bird families must have migrated (118 - 18 = 100). Therefore, 100 bird families migrated to their winter homes."
Response: 36 families of birds live near the mountain. If 18 new families of birds join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now 54.
"Response: 36

Explanation: According to the passage, 49 families of birds live near the mountain and 59 families have migrated for winter. This means that 10 (59 - 49) families of birds are still near the mountain. Therefore, there are 36 bird families remaining near the mountain."
Response:  There are 64 porodice of birds that remained near the mountain.
"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the passage, ""86 porodica ptica"" has already left for warmer climates. Therefore, if there were initially 45 families of birds that lived near the mountain and some of them stayed behind, then the number of families that left is equal to 86 - 45 = 41."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the passage, 62 families of birds migrated to Africa. However, only 35 families migrated to Asia. Therefore, there are 20 more families of birds that migrated to Africa than those that migrated to Asia."
"Response: 18
Explanation: According to the passage, ""tri porodice ptica"" (three families of birds) live near the mountain. Then, it is stated that ""26 novih porodica ptica"" (26 new families of birds) have arrived from the Arctic to live near the mountain. This means that there are now 3 + 26 = 39 bird families living near the mountain. Since two families left for warmer climates, there are now 39 - 2 = 37 bird families remaining near the mountain."

Explanation:
The given information can be represented in the following table:

| Number of Owls | Paul's Total Collection | Friends' Total Collection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 332 | 563 | 558 |

From the table, we can see that Paul had 332 owls initially and gave away 563 to his friends during the school year. This means he lost 558 owls. Therefore, the number of owls Paul received as a gift for his birthday is:

Number of owls Paul received = Total collection of friends - Number of owls Paul already had = 558 - 332 = 411

So, Paul received 411 owls as a gift for his birthday."

"Response: 39

Explanation:
According to the question, Paul sold some of his books at a garage sale and then bought 42 new ones. If he had 21 books initially, that means he sold 42 - 21 = 21 books.

Explanation: According to the question, Danny has 12 pockets in his collection and found 53 pocket caps in the park. Therefore, he currently has 49 pocket caps in total (12 + 53 = 65)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Danny has found 21 poklopaca in his collection. The question also states that he has found more poklopaca in the park, but does not provide an exact number. Therefore, we can assume that Danny has found 40 additional poklopaca in the park, bringing the total number of poklopaca he has found to 61 (21 from his collection + 40 from the park)."
"Response: 42
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 51 old coins and found 63 new ones in the park. This means that he had a total of 114 coins at one point (51 + 63). Since he now has 33 coins left, we can deduce that he started with 81 coins (114 - 33). Therefore, the answer is 42."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 36 poklopaca in the park and threw away 35 old ones. This means that he has 22 poklopaca left in his collection.

Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 30 caps and 14 labels in the park. After collecting more caps and labels from his collection, he had 7 caps and 86 labels. To find out how many more caps than ambalage Danny found in the park, we subtract the number of caps he already had from the total number of caps he found: 30 - 7 = 23. Therefore, Danny found 23 more caps than ambalage in the park."
"Response: 79
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 11 caps and 28 labels in the park. Now he has 68 bottle caps and 51 labels in his collection. To find out how many more labels than caps Danny found, we subtract the number of labels he found from the number of caps he found: 79 (labels) - 28 (labels) = 51. Therefore, Danny found 51 more labels than caps in the park."

Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 66 poklopaca in the park and lost 40 of them. Therefore, he had 26 poklopaca left, which is equal to 40 caps."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 25 poklopaca in his collection before he found some more in the park. Therefore, the total number of poklopaca he has now is 32 (the original 25 + the 7 he found in the park). So, the difference between the number of poklopaca he had before and after finding the additional ones in the park is 9 (40 - 31)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 40 caps at the beginning. This is because he found 60 old caps in the park and added 58 new ones, resulting in a total of 67 caps in his collection. Therefore, Danny started with 40 caps."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 50 new bottle caps in the park and already had 6 old ones, so he now has a total of 60 bottle caps in his collection. This means that he found 40 additional bottle caps beyond the ones he already had (50 + 6 = 40)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Danny collected 48 new Pokémon balls and already had 54 old ones in his collection. Therefore, he has a total of 102 Pokémon balls (48 + 54).

Therefore, Danny found 25 more caps than ambulances in the park."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 65 ambalazze and 5 caps in the park. Now he has 31 caps and 9 labels. To find out how many more ambalazze than caps Danny found, we subtract the number of caps he has now from the number of ambalazze he found: 65 - 31 = 34. Therefore, Danny found 40 more ambalazze than caps in the park."

Response:  Jeff's current number of baseball cards is 779 (535 + 234).
"Response: 27
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. She then had 415 baseball cards and 149 cards from the remaining 10 packs. Since each pack contains 10 cards, Nell has 27 packs left (415 / 10 = 27). Therefore, she has 27 more baseball cards than what is mentioned in the question."
"Response: 378
Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 cards of the number 10 variety, for a total of 460 cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 cards of the number 10 variety, for a total of 899 cards. To find out how many more 10-card packs Nell has than baseball card packs, we subtract the number of baseball card packs from the total number of cards she has: 899 - 460 = 439. Therefore, Nell has 439 more 10-card packs than baseball card packs."

Since she received more money from her father than from her mother, she has $2 more from her father than from her mother. Therefore, the answer is $2."
"Response: 3 dollars
Explanation: According to the passage, Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother for her birthday. If she spent $4 of that money, then she has $9 left ($5 + $7 - $4).

Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her $3 more than her father did."
"Response: 3 dollars
Explanation: According to the passage, Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother for a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she must have received more money from her father than from her mother.

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There were 41 children on the bus.
* Some of them got off at the bus station (but the number is not specified).
* Now, there are 18 children left in the bus.

So, to find out how many more children were in the bus than the current number, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children:

Number of children in bus before - Number of children who got off = Increase in number of children
= 41 -?

Since we know that there are 18 children left in the bus now, we can set up an equation based on this information:

41 - x = 18

Solving for x, we get:

x = 23

Therefore, there were 23 more children in the bus than the current number of children."

Explanation: According to the passage, each dress costs $240 and each shirt costs $210. Therefore, if they sold 177 shirts and 23 dresses during the game, they earned a total of:

$210 x 177 = $38,970 from shirts
$240 x 23 = $5,520 from dresses
Total revenue = $38,970 + $5,520 = $44,590
Therefore, the number of shirts that cost more than dresses is:

$44,590 - $38,970 = $5,620"
"Response:  $40
Explanation: According to the passage, each dress costs $115 and each shirt costs $25. Therefore, if they sold 78 dreses and 113 majicas during the game, the total revenue from dreses would be $9,050 ($115 x 78), and the total revenue from majics would be $2,825 ($25 x 113).

Explanation: According to the passage, Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest. If he earned $16 per day, it means that the harvest lasted for 50 weeks (since $1216 / $16 = 76 days)."
Response: 49538.
Response: 46089$
Response: 4756 dollars
"Response: 16578
Explanation:
Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvesting. To find out how much he earns in total during the season, we multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works: $403 x 233 = $93,000.
Now, if he has to pay $49 as rent every week, we can calculate the total amount he pays in rent over the course of the season by multiplying the weekly rent by the number of weeks he works: $49 x 233 = $11,317.
So, Lewis earns $93,000 and spends $11,317 on rent, leaving him with $81,683 ($93,000 - $11,317) after the season."

Response: 80 people can sit in the Ferris wheel at once. Explanation: The question states that there are 4 seats in each car of the Ferris wheel and that 20 people can ride at the same time. Therefore, if there are 4 cars in total, then the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 4 x 20 = 80.
"Response: 5
Explanation:  If there are several places in Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then the total number of people who can ride at once is 9 x Number of places = 9 x 7 = 63. Since 18 people can simultaneously sit in one place, it means that 18 / 63 = 0.29 or approximately 1/4 of the seats can be used at any given time, which is equal to 5."
Response: 400 people can ride in 20 helicopters at the same time. Explanation: Each helicopter has 19 seats, so 20 helicopters can accommodate 20 x 19 = 380 people. Since each seat can hold one person, the total number of people who can ride in all 20 helicopters is 380.
Response: 72 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time. Explanation: The Ferris wheel has 18 seats, and each seat can hold 15 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 18 x 15 = 270. However, since 10 seats are broken, only 72 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously.
"Response: 32

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the passage, Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total, and they put 12 seeds in each flower bed. Since only 58 flowers grew in all the flower beds combined, that means there were 58 / 12 = 4 different flower beds. Therefore, Paige and her mother had 4 flower beds."
"Response: 55/2 = 27

Explanation:
Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds in total, and they put 15 seeds in each flower bed. Since only 60 seeds germinated into flowers in all the flower beds, that means there were 60 - 15 = 45 unused seeds. Therefore, the number of flowers grown is equal to the number of used seeds divided by 2, which is 45 / 2 = 27."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of their flower beds, which means they planted a total of 60 seeds (10 x 6 = 60). Since they had 30 flower beds, that's how many flower beds they had."

Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 12 friends (including himself), and he gave each of them 2 creepers, so Matthew had 12 x 2 = 24 creepers in total."
"Response: 4
Question:  How many creepers did Matthew have if he gave 2 to each of his friends?  Answer: 4"
Response:  Each of Matthew's five friends received 3 creamers (since there are 3 x 5 = 15 creamers in total). Therefore, each friend had 3 creamers / 5 friends = 0.6 creamers per friend.
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 24 creepers and gave some of them to his three friends. If he gave an equal number of creepers to each friend (which is what the question implies), then he would have given away 24 / 3 = 8 creepers to each friend. Therefore, Matthew now has 24 - 8 = 16 creepers left."
Response:  Each of Matthew's 11 friends received an equal number of crackers and cookies, so they each got 22/11 = 19 crackers and 34/11 = 30 cookies.
Response:  Each of Matthew's friends received an equal number of cookies and crackers as they had fingers to count them with. So, if Matthew gave away 30 crackers and 29 cookies, then each friend received 30/5 = 6 crackers and 29/5 = 5 cookies.
Response:  Each of Matthew's seven friends received an equal number of creamers and cookies that Matthew had in total. Therefore, if Matthew had 14 creamers and 21 cookies, each friend would have received 14/7 = 2 creamers and 21/7 = 3 cookies.
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Matthew has 36 creamers and he shared them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would get 2 creamers (36/18 = 2)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave away 6 creepers to each of his 4 friends. Therefore, he had 4 x 6 = 24 creepers in total."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 23 creepers and gave 11 of them to his friends. Therefore, each friend received 4 creepers (23 / 11 = 4)."
Response: 7
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the problem, Matthew had 32 creamers and 98 cookies among his four friends. If each friend had an equal number of creamers and cookies, then each friend would have 32/4 = 8 creamers and 98/4 = 24 cookies. Therefore, one person would have eaten 16 creamers (8 x 2)."
Response:  Each of Matthew's friends received an equal number of crackers and cookies from him. If he had 10 crackers and 8 cookies to start with, then each friend received 5/6 of the total amount (or 10/6 + 8/6 = 13/6). Therefore, each friend received 2.17 crackers and 1.33 cookies.
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the problem, Matthew shared an equal number of crackers and cookies with his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cookies in the beginning, then each friend would have received 1/28 = 0.0714 (approximately 7 crackers or 9 cookies). Therefore, 4 people would have eaten at least one cracker or cookie."

Explanation:  To find out how many olovka Faye has, we need to calculate the total number of olovki in all her packages and then add them up. In this case, she had 6 package with each containing 14 olovki, so the total number of olovki is 6 x 14 = 84. Since there are 22 olovki in each row, the total number of olovki Faye has is 84 x 22 = 1792. Finally, since she stapled these olovki into rows, the total number of olovki Faye has is 1792 / 22 = 82. So, Faye has 82 olovki."
Response:  The number of rows that can be formed is 35 / 5 = 7.
Response:  Faye has 19 rows with 4 olive and 27 colors in each row. Therefore, she has a total of 835 olive (4 x 4 = 16 + 27 x 19 = 835).

Response:  Faye could have made 6 reds (30 / 5 = 6).
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Faye has placed 6 olovaka in two rows. Since she has placed an equal number of olovaka in each row, there are 3 olovaka in each row. Therefore, the total number of olovaka that Faye has placed is 3 x 3 = 9."
Response:  Faye had 35 boxes of nails, each containing 4 nails. She arranged them in rows with two nails in each row. How many rows could she have made?
"Response: 420
Explanation:
Faye has 31 packs of nails, and each pack contains 6 nails. Therefore, she has a total of 31 x 6 = 186 nails. Since she has arranged them in rows with 19 nails in each row, she has a total of 186 / 19 = 9 rows. So, Faye has 9 x 19 = 171 nails left after arranging them in rows."

Response: 360 (mjesto u svakom autobusu)
"Response: 6720
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The school has 84 classrooms.
* Each classroom can accommodate 30 students (based on the average class size).
* Therefore, the total number of students in the school is: 84 x 30 = 2520 students.

However, we are also told that there are 95 school buses with 118 seats each. This means that the total number of students who will be going on the field trip is: 95 x 118 = 11,270 students.

So, the final answer to the question is: 2520 + 11,270 = 13,790 students."
"Response: 1.
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 67 classrooms and each classroom has 66 students, so the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4252. Since each school bus can accommodate 6 passengers, we need 4252 / 6 = 709 school buses to transport all the students for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 1."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has an equal number of students (58/class). Since there are 87 classes in total, we have:
Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class
= 87 x 58
= 4960 students
Since there are 2 seats available in each bus, we need:
Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus
= 4960 / 2
= 2480 buses
Therefore, 4 buses are needed to transport all the students for the field trip."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, there are 120 / 6 = 20 classes in the school. Since each bus can accommodate 84 students, there are 84 x 6 = 504 students in total. So, the number of students in each class is 504 / 20 = 25."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 102 students in total and 8 seats per bus, then the number of buses needed is:
102 / 8 = 13
Since 22 students do not want to go on the trip, we subtract that number from the total number of students:
102 - 22 = 80
So, there will be 4 buses for the remaining 80 students."
Response: 34 students will go on the field trip. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 102 classrooms and 11 students in each classroom. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 102 x 11 = 1122 students. If 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, that means 1122 - 8 = 1114 students will go on the field trip.
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 72 classrooms in the school and each bus can hold 3 students per seat, then the total number of students that can go on the field trip is 72 x 3 = 216. Since there are only 111 students in the school, we need to send 4 buses on the field trip."
"Response: 53
Explanation: If there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total, then each bus can hold at most 53 students (since there are only 46 buses)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: If there are 11 boys and each boy has as many marbles as Haley had (9), then the total number of marbles is 11 x 9 = 99. Since Haley gave away all her marbles, the remaining amount is 99 - 9 = 80."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave each of the five boys 5 kuglicas (kuglice). Therefore, the total number of kuglice given to all the boys is 5 x 5 = 25."
"Response: 7
Explanation: If Haley has 23 kuglice and wants to keep 15 for himself, that means he will give away 9 kuglice to the boys. Therefore, the boys will get 9 kuglice each."
Response: 13/2 = 6.5
"Response: 4
Explanation: Since there are 5 children in total and Haley has 20 marbles to share equally among them, each child will receive 4 marbles (20 / 5 = 4)."

Explanation: According to the question, each boy received 2 balls from Haley, and there were 28 boys in total. Therefore, the number of balls each boy had was 28 / 14 = 2."
"Response: 50 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank reads 14 pages of his favorite book every day. To calculate how many days it will take him to finish the book, we can multiply the number of pages he reads per day by the number of days he has been reading the book: 392 pages / 14 pages/day = 50 days."
"Response: 10485763200

Explanation:
The given information can be used to calculate the number of pages in the book as follows:

Number of days = 569 days
Number of pages per day = Number of days / 22 days per page = 569 / 22 = 2590 pages per day
Total number of pages = Total number of days \* Number of pages per day = 569 \* 2590 = 14775000 pages
Since there are 1000 pages in a standard novel, we can convert the total number of pages to a decimal value by dividing it by 1000:
14775000 pages / 1000 = 147750000 pages
Therefore, the answer is 10485763200 pages."
"Response: 37
Explanation:
Frank read his favorite book for 6 days and it had 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. Therefore, he read 612/6 = 102 pages per day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide 102 by 24 to get the number of pages Frank read each hour: 102/24 = 4.25 pages per hour."
"Response: 31
Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:
• Frank read his favorite book.
• The book had 555 pages divided into 5 chapters.
• It took Frank 220 days to finish the book.
To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:
555 pages / 5 chapters = 111 pages per chapter
Therefore, there are 111 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 4.27 (or rounding to 4.3)
Explanation:
To find out how many pages Frank read each day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the time it took him to finish the book. Since he finished the book in 660 days and there are 193 pages in the book, we can calculate his daily reading rate as follows:

Pages per day = Total pages / Time taken to finish the book
= 193 / 660
= 4.27 (or rounded to 4.3)
Therefore, Frank read approximately 4.27 or 4.3 pages every day during the time he spent reading his favorite book."
"Response: 81
Explanation:
Frank read 249 pages in each book, and he needed 3 days to finish each book. Therefore, he read 81 pages per day (249 / 3)."
Response: 492 days
"Response: 7
Explanation: If it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book and the book had 112 pages, then he read 7 pages per day on average."
"Response: 10 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frank reads 8 pages of his favorite book every day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish reading the entire book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily page count. In this case, the total number of pages is 576, and Frank reads 8 pages per day, so the number of days it will take him to finish the book is: Number of days = 576 / 8 = 72 days."
"Response: 275
Explanation:
Frank read his favorite book for 30 days, and each chapter has 450 pages. Therefore, he read 450 pages per day. To find out how many pages he read in total, we can multiply the number of chapters by the number of pages per chapter: 41 x 450 = 18,650 pages. So, Frank read 18,650 pages in 30 days, which is equivalent to 275 pages per day (18,650 / 30)."
"Response: 1582

Explanation:
The given information can be used to calculate the number of pages in each chapter and then add them up to get the total number of pages in the book.

Chapter 1 has 594 pages, so Chapter 2 will have 594 + 594 = 1188 pages.
Chapter 3 has 594 pages as well, so the total number of pages in the book is 1188 + 1188 = 2376 pages.
Therefore, there are 2376 pages in the book."
"Response: 39
Explanation:
The book had 2 chapters with 405 pages each, for a total of 810 pages in the book. Since it took Frank 664 days to finish reading the book, he must have read approximately 39 pages per day."

Response: 4 packs of DVDs can be bought for $93.
"Response:  $39

Explanation:
If each package of DVDs costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then the cost of each package after the discount would be $51 ($76 - $25). To find out how much you need to pay for each package, divide the total amount by the number of packages you want to buy: $51 / 3 = $17 per package. Therefore, you would need to pay $39 to buy all three packages."

Response: 4 groups
"Response: 23569

Explanation:
The given information can be interpreted as follows:

* ""Ima"" means ""there are"" in Croatian. So, there are some number of bananas in Filip's collection.
* ""banana"" is singular, so we have one banana.
* ""u Filipovoj kolekciji"" means ""in Filip's collection"".
* ""banana"" is plural, so we need to multiply the number of bananas by 140 to get the total number of groups.
* The size of each group is given as 187, which means that we need to divide the total number of bananas by this value to get the number of bananas in each group.

Putting it all together, we get:
Total number of bananas = Number of bananas x Number of groups
= 1 x (Number of bananas / Size of each group)
= 1 x (23569 / 187)
= 23569

Therefore, the answer is 23569."
"Response: 14
Explanation: If there are 203 bananas in total and they are organized into 7 groups, then each group contains an average of 28.9 bananas (203 / 7 = 28.9). Similarly, if there are 63 oranges in total and they are organized into 95 groups, then each group contains an average of 0.66 oranges (63 / 95 = 0.66). Therefore, each group of bananas contains approximately 14 oranges (28.9 / 0.66 = 14)."

"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the question, Brenda made 18 kolačića in total and each guest had an equal number of kolačića as there were guests (10 or 9). Therefore, if there were 10 guests, each guest would have received 2 kolačića (18 / 10 = 2), and if there were 9 guests, each guest would have received 3 kolačića (18 / 9 = 2)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Brenda made 14 cookies for two guests. If each cookie had the same number of chocolate chips as there were guests, then there would be 14 x 2 = 28 chocolate chips in total. Since there are only 7 chocolate chips per cookie, this means that each cookie has 28 / 7 = 4 chocolate chips."

Question:  How many children from the district of Lawrence are attending summer camp during the summer holidays?  Based on the information provided in the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 455682"
"Response: 376489

Explanation:
The number of children who went to camp is given as 800059. The total number of children in the county is 828521. Therefore, the number of children who remained at home can be calculated as follows:

Number of children remaining at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp
= 828521 - 800059
= 376489

Therefore, there were 376489 children who remained at home during the summer vacation."

Question:  How many children from the district of Lawrence attend summer camp?  Based on the information provided, there are 610769 children from the district of Lawrence who go to summer camp, and 590796 children who stay at home. Therefore, the number of children from the district of Lawrence who attend summer camp is 610769."
"Response: 1022706

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Let N = number of children who stayed at home in Lawrence County.
Let K = number of children who went to camp.
Let I = number of international children who attended the camp.
From the problem statement, we know that:
N + K + I = 644997 (total number of children)
K = 893835 - 78 (number of children who went to camp minus those from abroad)
Substituting this value for K into the first equation gives:
N + K + I = 644997
N = 1022706 (since K = 893835 and I = 78)"

"Response: 468

Explanation:
Helen has baked 19 chocolate cookies last night and 231 chocolate cookies today, which means she has baked a total of 250 chocolate cookies. Since the question states that Helen has also made 237 chocolate truffles, we can subtract the number of chocolate truffles from the total number of chocolate cookies to find out how many more chocolate cookies Helen has made than chocolate truffles. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate cookies and chocolate truffles is:

250 - 237 = 13

So, Helen has made 13 more chocolate cookies than chocolate truffles."
