Response:  The number of people who went to the beach on July 6th is given as 6. Now, we need to find out how many more or less than 6 people there were in total. So, if there were 6 people in total, then the answer would be 0 (zero). If there were fewer than 6 people, then the answer would be a negative number indicating the difference between the actual and expected numbers. And vice versa. Therefore, the correct answer is -2 (negative two).
"Response: 

1. The number of people who have died in July 2018 is given as 18.
2. To find out how many people die per month, we need to divide the total number of deaths by the number of months that have passed since January 2018 (i.e., from January 2018 to July 2018).
3. So, the number of people who die per month = Total number of deaths / Number of months = 18 / 6 = 3

Therefore, approximately 3 people die every month in Bangladesh due to heat wave."
Response:  On July 4th, they played with 4 children. On July 5th, they played with 6 more children, so the total number of children they played with on that day was 10 (4 + 6). On July 7th, they played with 17 more children, so the total number of children they played with on that day was 27 (10 + 17). Therefore, on July 7th, they played with 13 more children than they did on July 4th.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Babi and his friends together collected 25 mixtures of rice.
Then, they gave away 43 mixtures of rice to others.
So, the number of mixtures of rice that Babi and his friends had after giving them away is:

25 - 43 = (-)18

Therefore, Babi and his friends had 18 mixtures of rice left after giving them away."
"Response: 
Step 1: Babi played 28 games and scored 42 points in each game. So, he scored a total of 28 x 42 = 1176 points in all.
Step 2: After that, they played another 43 games and scored 6 more points per game. So, they scored a total of 43 x 6 = 258 points in these additional games.
Step 3: Therefore, the total number of points Babi scored is 1176 + 258 = 1434 points."
"Response: 
Step 1 (33 questions): Babi answered 4 questions correctly and got 29 incorrect.
Step 2 (4 questions): Babi answered 1 question correctly and got 3 wrong.
Step 3 (14 questions): Babi answered 7 questions correctly and got 7 wrong.
Total number of correct answers = 4 + 7 = 11
Total number of incorrect answers = 29 + 3 + 7 = 49
Therefore, Babi answered a total of 49 questions incorrectly."
"Response: 

Step 1 (38 - 20) = 18
Step 2 (18 x 36) = 672
Step 3 (672 / 16) = 42

So, Babi has answered 42 questions correctly in total."
"Response: 

Step 1: Babir played 20 games and won 34 points.

"Response: 

Step 1: Babir played 21 games and won 5 of them.

Step 2: After that, he played another 9 games and won 3 of them.

So, in total, Babir won 8 games (5 + 3)."
"Response: 

Step 1: Babir had 22 marbles initially. He lost some and gained some later.

Step 2: After losing some marbles, he had 5 left.

Step 3: Then, he gained 8 more marbles. So, his new total is: 5 + 8 = 13 marbles.

Therefore, Babir had 13 marbles in the end."
Response:  The total number of mugs is 19. If they have 2 mugs each, then the number of people who will get mugs = Total number of mugs / Number of people sharing = 19 / 3 = 6. So, there are 6 people who will get mugs.
"Response:  The given information is as follows:

* Babir had 32 mistis (money) at first.
* He gave some money to his friend.
* If Babir's remaining money was 20 tikas (a smaller unit of currency), then he must have given away some amount of money.

So, we can conclude that Babir gave away 12 misti (the difference between his initial amount and his remaining amount). Therefore, the answer is 12."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Babi has 17 balls in total. Out of those, he threw 15 balls. So, the number of balls left with him is:

17 - 15 = 2

Now, if he had 36 balls initially, and he threw 15 balls, then the number of balls left with him would be:

36 - 15 = 21

Therefore, Babi has 21 balls left with him."
Response:  If Bob can make 23 mistakes in 30 minutes, then he will make 1 mistake every 45 seconds (30/23). So, if he makes 30 mistakes, it means he made 1 mistake every 1 minute and 20 seconds (30/1 = 30). Therefore, there are 30 mistakes left after making 30 mistakes.
"Response: 
Alan has 5 belly buttons and Jack has 3 belly buttons. So, in total, they have 8 belly buttons (5 + 3)."
"Response: 
Alan has 2 belly buttons and Jack has 3 belly buttons. So, in total, they have 5 belly buttons (2 + 3 = 5)."
Response:  If Subuj has 2 belons and Jack has 3 belons, then together they have 5 belons. So, Jack has 4 belons (5 - 2 = 4).
Response:  If Jack has 4 belly buttons and each belly button represents 4 balls, then he has a total of 16 balls (4 x 4 = 16). So, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Jack can carry 10 belons in one trip to the park, and he makes 2 trips to the park, then he will carry 2 x 10 = 20 belons to the park.
"Response: 
Alan has 3 balls and Jack has 5 balls. After they played together for some time, Alan had 2 more balls than he initially had, and Jack had 4 fewer balls than he initially had. So, at this point, Alan had 5 balls (including the additional two), and Jack had 1 ball less than he initially had. Therefore, the final number of balls that Alan had was 5 + 2 = 7, and the final number of balls that Jack had was 1 - 4 = 0."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that:

* Alam Park has 2 belons.
* Jack Park has 4 belons.
* After Alam Park gave some of its belons to Jack Park, it had 3 belons left.

So, the number of belons that Alam Park gave to Jack Park is:

3 - 2 = 1

Therefore, there were 1 belon more in Jack Park than in Alam Park."
"Response: 
Alan has 2 belons and Jack has 6 belons. Alan gives 3 belons to Park. So, now Alan has 2 - 3 = 1 belon left, and Jack has 6 - 3 = 3 belons left. Therefore, there were 3 belons more in Alan's bag than in Park's bag."
"Response: 
Alan has 5 belly buttons and Jack has 4 belly buttons. So, in total, they have 9 belly buttons (5 + 4 = 9).
Now, Alan gave 3 of his belly buttons to Park. So, he has 6 belly buttons left (5 - 3 = 6).
Therefore, Alan has 6 belly buttons and Jack has 4 belly buttons, so the final answer is 10 (6 + 4 = 10)."
"Response: 
Alan had 6 balls in his pocket and gave 2 balls to Jack. Then Alan went to the park with Jack and they played together for some time. After that, Alan returned home and took out 3 more balls from his pocket. So, the total number of balls that Alan had after returning home is:
6 + 2 = 8 (balls given to Jack)
+ 3 = 11 (additional balls taken back home)
Therefore, the final number of balls that Alan had at home was 11."
"Response: 

Alan has 6 belly buttons and Jack has 3 belly buttons. If Park took more than 4 belly buttons from Alan, then there are 2 belly buttons left with Alan. So, the number of belly buttons that Park took is 6 - 2 = 4."
"Response: 
Alan has 5 balls and Jack has 6 balls.
From Alan, 3 balls are given to Park. So, now Alan has 2 balls left.
Now, from Jack, 4 balls are given to Park. So, now Jack has 2 balls left.
Therefore, Jack gave a total of 6 balls (3 + 4) to Park."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are 30 people in the park and they have been talking for 2 hours. So, the total number of words spoken is:

Number of words = Total time spent talking x Number of people talking
= 2 x 30
= 60

Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We know that Jack has been speaking for 5 minutes and he has spoken 59 words during this time. So, the number of words spoken by Jack is:

Number of words = Time taken to speak x Number of words spoken
= 5 x 59
= 295

Therefore, the total number of words spoken by all the people in the park including Jack is:

Total number of words = Number of words spoken by Alana + Number of words spoken by Jack
= 60 + 295
= 355

So, the answer to the question is 355."
"Response: 

Alan and Jack went to the park together. Alan saw 7 birds and counted them. Then he saw 5 more birds and counted them too. So, in total, Alan saw 12 birds at the park.

Now, let's consider Jack's count. Jack also saw some birds at the park, but he didn't see as many as Alan did. Jack saw 6 birds and counted them. Therefore, the total number of birds that both Alan and Jack saw at the park is:

12 (Alan) + 6 (Jack) = 18

So, there were 18 birds seen at the park by both Alan and Jack."
Response:  If Alana has 5 belly buttons and Jack has 6 belly buttons, then together they have 11 belly buttons (5 + 6 = 11). So, Jack has more belly buttons than Alana.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Alana parked two cars in her parking lot and then she sold three more cars to Jack. So, the total number of cars in Alana's parking lot is 2 + 3 = 5 cars.
Now, let's consider the situation where Jack bought six cars from Alana. If he bought six cars, then there will be a total of 6 + 5 = 11 cars in Alana's parking lot after Jack made his purchase.
So, the final answer is 11 cars."
"Response: 
Rayan has to work for 6 hours every day as an English teacher and 2 hours every day as a Chinese teacher. So, in total, Rayan works for 8 hours per day (6 + 2).
Now, let's calculate how many days he will work in a month. There are 30 days in April, so Rayan will work for 240 hours in April (8 x 30).
Now, let's convert this time into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Rayan will work for 14,400 minutes in April (240 x 60).
So, the answer is 14,400 minutes."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 6 hours in a day and Chinese for 7 hours in a day. So, Rayan spends 6 + 7 = 13 hours speaking languages every day."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 3 hours every day and Chinese for another 2 hours. So in total, Rayan spends 5 hours speaking languages per day (3 + 2 = 5).
Now, if we assume that Sarbamot has to spend an equal amount of time learning each language, then he will also spend 5 hours per day learning both English and Chinese (4 x 5 = 20 hours/day).
Therefore, the answer is 20 hours."
"Response: 
For English teacher, he/she has to teach for 7 hours per day. So, in one week (Monday to Sunday), he/she will have to teach for 7 x 7 = 49 hours.
Now, let's calculate how many hours Chinese teacher has to teach. If English teacher has to teach for 49 hours in one week, then Chinese teacher has to teach for 49 - 2 = 47 hours in one week."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 5 hours in a day. So, he can speak Chinese for 2 hours less than that, i.e., 3 hours.
Therefore, Rayan can speak Chinese for 3 hours in a day."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 6 hours a day and Chinese for 7 hours a day. If he spends 5 days speaking, then in total he will have spoken:
English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
So Rayan has spoken a total of 65 hours (30 + 35) during those 5 days."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 6 hours in a day and Chinese for 5 hours in a day. If he spends 2 days speaking, then he will spend a total of 12 hours speaking English and 10 hours speaking Chinese. So, Rayan has spent a total of 22 hours speaking both languages combined."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 5 hours per day and Chinese for 4 hours per day. If he spends 6 days speaking these languages, then the total time spent speaking them is:
English: 5 x 6 = 30 hours
Chinese: 4 x 6 = 24 hours
So Rayan has spoken a total of 54 hours (30 + 24) of English and Chinese during those 6 days."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 4 hours per day and Chinese for 6 hours per day. If he spends 86 days speaking these languages, then:
English: 4 hours/day x 86 days = 324 hours
Chinese: 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours
Therefore, Rayan has spoken a total of 828 hours (324 + 504) in English and Chinese during his 86-day language learning journey."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 6 hours a day, Chinese for 7 hours a day and Spanish for 3 hours a day. So in total, Rayan spends 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours speaking different languages every day."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 6 hours a day, Chinese for 3 hours a day and Spanish for 58 hours a week. So in one week, Rayan can speak English for 42 hours (6 x 7), Chinese for 10 hours (3 x 7) and Spanish for 392 hours (58 x 7). Therefore, Rayan can speak English for 42 hours more than Chinese and Spanish combined."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 7 hours in a day.
For Chinese, he needs to practice for 2 hours every day.
And for Spanish, he needs to study for 4 hours daily.
So, Rayan spends a total of 13 hours (7 + 2 + 4) studying languages every day."
"Response: 
Rayan can speak English for 2 hours every day, and Chinese for 5 hours every day. So in total, Rayan spends 7 hours (2 + 5) speaking languages every day.
Now, let's calculate how much time Rayan spends speaking Spanish per day. Since he spends 4 hours speaking Spanish every day, Rayan spends 4/7 of his total language-speaking time on Spanish. Therefore, Rayan spends 4/7 \* 7 = 1.78 hours speaking Spanish per day."
"Response: 
Day 1: English lesson for 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes
Day 2: Chinese lesson for 2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes
Total time spent on both languages = 180 + 120 = 300 minutes
So, Chiena spent 300 minutes (or 5 hours) learning both languages in total."
"Response: 
Rayan spent 7 days in England and China respectively.
He studied English for 4 hours per day during his stay in England.
And he studied Chinese for 5 hours per day during his stay in China.
So, Rayan studied English for a total of 28 hours (4 hours/day x 7 days) while he was in England.
Similarly, he studied Chinese for a total of 35 hours (5 hours/day x 7 days) while he was in China."
Response:  On Sunday, they watched 8 TV channels. The next day (Monday), they watched 7 more TV channels. So, in total, they watched 15 TV channels.
"Response: 
Day 1: They saw 7 branches of canals.
Day 2: They saw 12 branches of canals.
So, in total they saw 7 + 12 = 19 branches of canals."
"Response: 
Day 1: They saw 4 branches of canals.
Day 2: They saw some more branches (not specified how many).
Total number of branches seen = 4 + (some more)
= 4 + x
where x is the total number of branches seen on Day 3.
So, the answer is 4 + x."
"Response: 
Day 1: They watched 3 bags of rice.
Day 2: They watched 4 bags of rice.
Total number of bags of rice watched = 3 + 4 = 7
So, they watched 7 bags of rice in total."
Response:  On Monday, they found 10 bags of rice. On Tuesday, they found 3 more bags of rice, so now there are 13 bags in total (10 + 3). On Wednesday, they found another 7 bags of rice, so now there are 20 bags in total (13 + 7). Therefore, the total number of bags of rice found is 20.
Response:  On Monday, they had 8 bags of rice. Then on Tuesday, they had 10 bags of rice, and on Wednesday, they had 4 bags of rice. So in total, they had 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 bags of rice on Sunday.
Response:  On Monday, they had 3 bags of rice and added 4 more bags. So, the total number of bags of rice they had after Monday is 3 + 4 = 7 bags. Then, on Tuesday, they added another 21 bags of rice to their collection, so the total number of bags of rice they had after Tuesday is 7 + 21 = 28 bags. Therefore, the number of bags of rice they had in total was 28.
"Response:  The given information is:

17 red apples and 16 sweet apples are in the basket.

So, the total number of apples in the basket = 17 + 16 = 33 apples.

Therefore, there are 33 apples in the basket, including both red and sweet ones."
"Response: 
From the given information, we know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in Basu's basket. So, the total number of apples in Basu's basket is 5 + 11 = 16.
Now, we need to find out how many more or fewer apples each type has than the total number of apples in Basu's basket.
For red apples, since there are already 5 apples in the basket, for each additional apple, we will have 1 less than the total number of apples in the basket. So, if there were x more red apples, then the total number of red apples would be 5 + x - 1 = 4x - 1.
Similarly, for green apples, if there were x more green apples, then the total number of green apples would be 11 + x - 1 = 10x - 1.
Now, we can substitute these values into the equation:
Red apples: 4(16) - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63
Green apples: 10(16) - 1 = 160 - 1 = 159
So, there are 63 red apples and 159 green apples in Basu's basket."
Response:  If there are 10 red apples in the basket and 5 of them are already rotten, then there will be 5 rotten apples left in the basket. So, among the remaining 5 apples, if 3 are green and 2 are yellow, then there will be 1 yellow apple left in the basket. Therefore, the final answer is 1 yellow apple.
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are three red apples and four green apples in Basu's basket. So, the total number of apples in Basu's basket is:

3 + 4 = 7

So, there are seven apples in Basu's basket."
"Response: 
7 lal (red) apples, 15 haldi (ginger) apples, and 8 subuj (lemon) apples are there in the basket. So, the total number of apples in the basket is:
7 + 15 + 8 = 30
Therefore, there are 30 apples in the basket."
"Response: 
From the given information, we know that there are 7 red apples, 81 green apples, and 8 orange apples in the basket. So, the total number of apples in the basket is:
7 + 81 + 8 = 96 apples.
So, among these 96 apples, 7 are red, which means 89 are not red (green or orange)."
"Response: 
From the given information, we know that there are 2 red apples and 6 green apples in Basu's basket. Also, there are 14 orange apples in Basu's basket.
So, the total number of apples in Basu's basket is:
2 + 6 = 8 (red apples)
8 + 14 = 22 (orange apples)
Therefore, there are 22 apples in Basu's basket."
Response:  We have 19 red apples and 11 green apples. If we subtract the number of green apples (11) from the total number of apples (30), we get 19. So, there are 19 red apples in the basket.
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are 6 red apples and 90 green apples in the basket. Also, there are 16 sweet apples in the basket.

So, the total number of apples in the basket is:

6 + 90 = 96 apples (red + green)

And among them, 16 are sweet apples.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

96 apples (red + green) and 16 sweet apples."
"Response: 
From the given information, we know that there are 18 red apples and 14 green apples in the basket.
So, the total number of apples in the basket is 18 + 14 = 32.
Now, we are asked how many red and green apples are in the basket.
Red apples make up 18/32 = 0.56 of the total apples, and green apples make up 14/32 = 0.44 of the total apples."
"Response: 
From the given information, we know that there are 5 red apples and 14 green apples in the basket. Also, there are 6 sweet apples and 3 sour apples in the basket. So, the total number of apples in the basket is:
5 + 14 = 19 red apples
6 + 3 = 9 sweet apples
Total number of apples in the basket = 19 + 9 = 28 apples."
Response:  The total number of tokars is 65. Now, we know that each tokar has either red or blue color. So, the total number of red tokars is 7 x 65 = 455, and the total number of blue tokars is 3 x 65 = 195. Therefore, there are 455 red tokars and 195 blue tokars in total.
"Response:  We have 11 tokras in total. Each tokra has 10 lal peches and 18 subuj peches. So, the total number of peches in all tokras is:

11 tokras x 10 lal peches/tokra = 110 lal peches
11 tokras x 18 subuj peches/tokra = 198 subuj peches
Therefore, there are 110 lal peches and 198 subuj peches in all the tokras combined."
"Response: 
Total number of tokars = 6
Each tokar has 16 lal peanuts and 18 sabuj peanuts.
So, total number of lal peanuts = 6 x 16 = 96
And total number of sabuj peanuts = 6 x 18 = 108.
Therefore, there are 96 lal peanuts and 108 sabuj peanuts in all six baskeets."
"Response: 
There are 7 tokras in total.
Each tokra has 10 lal pencils and 2 subuj pencils.
So, the total number of lal pencils = 7 x 10 = 70.
And the total number of subuj pencils = 7 x 2 = 14.
Therefore, there are 70 lal pencils and 14 subuj pencils in all the tokras combined."
"Response: 
From the given information we know that there are 4 red balls and 3 blue balls in total. So, the number of balls in each group is as follows:

So, the total number of balls is 16 + 9 = 25."
"Response: 
There are 2 tokors with 4 red beads each and 12 white beads in total. So, there are 4 x 4 = 16 red beads and 12 x 2 = 24 white beads. Therefore, the total number of beads in both tokors is 16 + 24 = 40 beads."
Response:  If there are 16 tokors in total and 13 of them are red, then the number of red tokors is 13/16 = 0.8125. Since we want to find out how many red tokors will be left after some of them turn blue, we need to subtract the number of red tokors that turned blue from the total number of tokors. So, if 4 tokors turn blue, we have: Number of red tokors remaining = Total number of tokors - Number of tokors that turned blue = 16 - 4 = 12. Therefore, 12 red tokors will remain after 4 tokors turn blue.
"Response: 
There are 19 red tokens and 4 green tokens in total. If there are 15 red tokens left, then there must be at least 4 green tokens remaining (since they make up 26% of the total). Therefore, there will be 4 + 4 = 8 green tokens remaining.
So, in total, there will be 19 + 8 = 27 tokens remaining."

"Response: 

There are 6 cats and 2 dogs in the house.
So, there are 8 living beings in total (cats + dogs).
Now, if we add 3 more cats to the house, then there will be 9 living beings in total (cats + dogs).

So, the answer is:

8 + 3 = 11"
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 60 kg of rice. To do this, we need to know the volume of one bag of rice. So let's assume that one bag of rice has a volume of 25 liters (this is just an assumption, as there may be different volumes for different types or brands of rice). Now, if we want to fill 60 kg of rice into 7 bags, we can use the formula: Volume of each bag = Total weight / Number of bags. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Volume of each bag = 60 kg / 7 bags = 8.57 liters per bag. Therefore, 7 bags of rice can be filled with 60 kg of rice.
Response:  The first book has 48 pages and the second book has 11 pages. So, the total number of pages in both books is 48 + 11 = 59 pages.
"Response:  The first book has 37 pages and the second book has 80 pages. So, if we want to find out how many more pages the second book has than the first book, we can subtract the number of pages in the first book from the number of pages in the second book:

Number of pages in second book - Number of pages in first book = 80 - 37 = 43

So, the second book has 43 more pages than the first book."
Response:  The first part of the book has 60 pages and if it contains more than 93 pages, then the second part will have x pages. So we can write an equation as follows: 60 + x = 93. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations.
Response:  We know that there are two rows of books in the shelf and each row has 18 books. So, the total number of books in both rows is 2 x 18 = 36 books. Now, if we add 67 more pages to the bookshelf, then the total number of pages will be 36 + 67 = 103 pages. Therefore, the second row contains 103 pages.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that there are three rows of books in total. So, the number of books in each row = Total number of books / Number of rows.
Now, let's find out the number of books in each row:
Row 1 has 66 books, Row 2 has 35 books, and Row 3 has 24 books.
So, the number of books in each row is:
Row 1 - 66 books
Row 2 - 35 books
Row 3 - 24 books
Now, to find out the total number of books, we need to multiply the number of books in each row:
Total number of books = (Number of books in Row 1 x Number of rows) + (Number of books in Row 2 x Number of rows) + (Number of books in Row 3 x Number of rows)
= (66 x 3) + (35 x 3) + (24 x 3)
= 208 + 99 + 72
= 379 books
Therefore, the bookshelf contains 379 books in total."
"Response: 
First book has 91 pages, second book has 23 pages less than first book (i.e., 68 pages), and third book has 25 pages less than second book (i.e., 43 pages).
So, we can write an equation based on these information as follows:
Book 1 = 91 pages
Book 2 = Book 1 - 23 pages = 68 pages
Book 3 = Book 2 - 25 pages = 43 pages
Now, we need to find out how many pages are there in total among all three books. So, let's add up the number of pages of each book:
Total pages = Book 1 + Book 2 + Book 3
= 91 + 68 + 43
= 192 pages
Therefore, the total number of pages among the three books is 192 pages."
"Response: 
Firstly, we have 3 books with different weights as follows:
Book 1 - 35 pages, weight = 35 g
Book 2 - 18 pages, weight = 18 g
Book 3 - 3 pages, weight = 3 g
Now, let's calculate the total weight of all three books together:
Total weight of Books 1 + Book 2 + Book 3 = 35 g + 18 g + 3 g = 60 g
Therefore, the answer is 60 g."

Response:  We know that Ed had $20 in his pocket initially and lost some money during the game. So, he has $19 left now. To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to divide the amount of money he lost ($2) by the cost of each marble ($0.10). Therefore, Ed lost 20 marbles during the game.
Response:  We know that Edhiti has 10 marbles initially and gives 3 to Dog. So, Edhiti now has 7 marbles left (10 - 3 = 7). Now, Dog takes 2 more marbles from Edhiti, so Dog now has 11 marbles (7 + 2 = 11). If Edhiti still has 45 marbles in total, then Dog must have taken 34 marbles (45 - 11 = 34) from Edhiti. Therefore, Edhiti has 12 marbles left (45 - 34 = 12).
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Edgar had 6 marbles initially.

Then, in one go, he lost 7 marbles to Doug. So, Edgar now has 6 - 7 = -1 marble less than before.

If Edgar still has 22 marbles, then he must have started with 22 + (-1) = 21 marbles.

Therefore, Doug took away 7 marbles from Edgar, leaving him with 21 marbles."

Firstly, we know that Edgar had 30 marbles in his pocket initially. Then, he lost 7 marbles from his pocket when he was at the beach. So, the number of marbles Edgar had left after losing 7 marbles is:
30 - 7 = 23 marbles.
Now, we are told that Edgar gave away 21 marbles to someone else while he was at the beach. So, the number of marbles Edgar has left after giving away 21 marbles is:
23 - 21 = 2 marbles.
Therefore, Edgar had 2 marbles left in his pocket after everything."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Ed has 12 marbles in his bag initially.

Then, 5 of them were taken away by his brother (i.e., 5 x 12 = 60 marbles). So, now Ed has 12 - 60 = 48 marbles left in his bag.

Now, his brother took 20 more marbles from Ed's bag, leaving him with 48 - 20 = 28 marbles.

So, out of every 100 students who apply for the scholarship program, about 56 will be selected for an interview."
"Response: 
The probability of a student getting selected for an interview is 182/300 = 0.607 or approximately 60.7%.
Now, let's calculate the probability of a student getting selected for an interview given that he has attended at least one mock test.
So, we need to find the probability of a student not attending any mock tests (i.e., 1 - 0.607) = 0.393 or approximately 39.3%."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who passed in all subjects.
Total number of students = 324 + 374 + 128 = 826
Step 2: Find out the percentage of students who got A+ grade in each subject separately.
Percentage of students getting A+ grade in Math = (324/826) x 100% = 40%
Percentage of students getting A+ grade in English = (374/826) x 100% = 45%
Percentage of students getting A+ grade in General Knowledge = (128/826) x 100% = 15%
Therefore, among the 826 students, 40% of them got A+ grade in Math, 45% of them got A+ grade in English, and only 15% of them got A+ grade in General Knowledge."
"Response: 
If 257 students are enrolled in the course and they all pass with an average score of 80%, then the total number of passing students is:

257 x 0.8 = 206

Now, if 120 students attend the examination and 97 of them pass, then the total number of passing students is:

120 x 0.97 = 114

Finally, if 97 students take the test and 93 of them pass, then the total number of passing students is:

97 x 0.93 = 90

Therefore, the final answer is:

206 + 114 + 90 = 400"
"Response: 
If 144 students are enrolled in a master's program and they all pass with an average score of 70%, then there will be 144 x 0.7 = 98 students who will get a distinction (i.e., above 80%).
Now, if 467 students are enrolled in a bachelor's program and they all pass with an average score of 65%, then there will be 467 x 0.65 = 302 students who will get a distinction (i.e., above 80%).
Finally, if 79 students are enrolled in a diploma program and they all pass with an average score of 85%, then there will be 79 x 0.85 = 66 students who will get a distinction (i.e., above 80%).
So, in total, there will be 98 + 302 + 66 = 466 students who will get a distinction among the three programs."
"Response: 
If 228 students are enrolled in the master's program and 337 students are enrolled in the bachelor's program, then the total number of students is 565 (228 + 337).
Now, if 23 students from the master's program join the PhD program, the total number of students in the PhD program will be 23 + 33 = 56.
So, out of the remaining 490 students, 133 students (33% of 490) will join the PhD program, which is 133 students."
"Response: 
If 450 students are enrolled in the course and each student has to submit an assignment worth 66 points, then the total number of points for all assignments is:
450 students x 66 points per assignment = 29,700 points
Now, if 38 students have already submitted their assignments and received a grade of A+ (worth 100 points), then the remaining points available for grading are:
Total points - Points awarded to those who have already submitted = 29,700 - 3800 = 26,900 points
So, out of the total 26,900 points available for grading, Superman can award up to 13,450 points (based on his claimed ability) to the top 45% of the students, which is:
13,450 points / 0.45 = 29,500 points
Therefore, Superman can award up to 29,500 points among the remaining 450 students."
"Response: 
Total number of students = 218 + 351 = 579
So, out of these 579 students, 218 passed and 351 failed in Mathematics."
"Response: 
If 269 students took part in the debate competition and Supervisor A gave 330 marks to those who participated, then the average mark for each student would be:

Average = Total marks awarded / Number of participants
= 330 x 269 / 269
= 1278

Now, if Supervisor B gave 760 marks to the 75 students who did not participate in the debate competition, then the average mark for each non-participant would be:

Average = Total marks awarded / Number of non-participants
= 760 x 75 / 75
= 1000

Therefore, the total number of marks obtained by all 344 students (including both participants and non-participants) is:
Total marks = Average mark for participants + Average mark for non-participants
= 1278 + 1000
= 2278"
"Response:  The total number of students in the school is 569 (students + teachers). Among them, 336 are male students and 230 are female students. So, the difference between the number of male and female students is:

Male students - Female students = 336 - 230 = 106

Therefore, among the 569 students in the school, there are 106 more male students than female students."
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 34 + 841 = 875. So, among the 34 meydedes (male students), there are 875 - 34 = 841 male students.
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is 485.
Out of them, 232 are males and 253 are females.
So, the total number of male students = 232.
And the total number of female students = 253.
Therefore, the total number of students in the school = 232 + 253 = 485."
"Response: 
The number of students in the school is 697 and there are 228 more boys than girls. So, the total number of male students = 697 + 228 = 925."
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is 635.
Out of them, 310 are girls and 325 are boys.
So, the number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students = 635 - 310 = 325."
Response:  The total number of students in that school is 868 and among them, 281 are girls. So, the number of boys in that school is 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, there are 587 male students in that school.
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is 700 and some (not exactly 700). If 142 more students join from Meydad's class, then the total number of students in the school will be 842 (not exactly 842). So, there are 842 students in that school."
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in total and among them, 222 are girls. So, the number of boys is 706 - 222 = 484. Now, we have to find out how many students are in class 10th. From the given information, we can see that there are 418 students who are not in class 10th. Therefore, the number of students in class 10th is 484 - 418 = 166.
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is given as 902 + 811 = 1713.
Now, 44 more students will join the school. So, the new total number of students in the school is:
1713 + 44 = 1757.
Therefore, there are 1757 students in the school now."
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is 632 + 410 = 1042.
If 465 male students are enrolled in the school, then the number of female students enrolled will be 1042 - 465 = 577."
Response:  The total number of students in the school is given as 732 + 761 = 1493. Now, among these students, there are 682 male students and 8 female students. So, the total number of male students in the school is 682.
"Response: 

135 students are in school A and 214 students are in school B.
So, the total number of students in both schools is:

135 + 214 = 349

Now, there are 496 students in total (including those who will join the school later). So, the number of students currently in school is:

349 - 496 = -147

Therefore, there are -147 students in the school(s)."
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is given as 308 + 318 = 626.
Since there are 36 teachers in the school, we can find out how many students each teacher teaches by dividing the total number of students by the number of teachers.
So, the number of students each teacher teaches is: 626 / 36 = 17.5
Therefore, there are approximately 17.5 students per teacher in that school."
"Response:  We know that there are 315 students in class A and 309 students in class B. So, the total number of students in both classes is:

315 + 309 = 624

Now, we also know that there are 772 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of students to teachers is:

624 / 772 = 0.82

Therefore, there are approximately 82 students for every teacher in this school."
Response:  If there are currently 402 students in the school and it will increase to 739 students if the current trend continues, then we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total Number of Students = Current Number of Students + (Future Number of Students - Current Number of Students) Total Number of Students = 402 + (739 - 402) Total Number of Students = 337 So, there will be 337 students in the school after the trend continues.
Response:  The total number of students in that school is given as 458 + x, where x is the number of new students who will join the school if it expands to accommodate 692 more students. Since the total number of students cannot be negative, we can say that x must be non-negative. Therefore, the number of new students joining the school = 692 - 458 = 234. So, there are 234 additional students in the expanded school.
"Response: 
The total number of students in the school is 362 + 257 = 619.
Now, 403 students will join the school. So, the new total number of students in the school is:
619 + 403 = 1022."
Response:  The total amount of money Edgar had was $18 dollars. He gave away $16 dollars. So, how much money does Edgar have left? $18 - $16 = $2 dollars.
Response:  Edwina had $13 initially and gave some money as charity. Now her remaining amount is $3. So, Edwina gave away $10 ($13 - $3).
"Response: 

Edward had $90 in his wallet and gave $8 to someone else. So, he now has $82 left in his wallet. Later, he received $17 more from that person.

Now, let's calculate how much money Edward had initially:
$90 - $8 = $82

So, the amount of money Edward had initially was $82."
Response:  Edwina had $92 in her wallet and spent $16 on something. Now she has $6 left. So, initially, Edwina had $92 - $16 = $76 in her wallet.
Response:  The total amount of money spent is $6 x 2 = $12. So each book costs half of that amount, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Edgar spent $600 on books and $160 on clothes. So, in total, he spent $760.

Now, after selling his old things for $19, he has $19 more than what he spent. Therefore, the amount of money Edgar had before selling his old things is:

$760 - $19 = $741

So, the answer is $741."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Edgar spent $4 on books and $3 on clothes. So, in total, he spent $7 (4 + 3).
Now, we are told that his grandmother gave him $12 as a gift. Therefore, the amount of money Edgar had before receiving the gift was $12 - $7 = $5."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the boy has 16 dollars in his wallet and he spends 8 dollars on a cola. So, now he has 8 dollars left in his wallet.

Now, he buys another cola for 4 dollars, so he spent a total of 12 dollars (8 + 4 = 12). Now, he has only 6 dollars left in his wallet (8 - 12 = 6).

So, the final amount of money the boy has in his wallet is 6 dollars."
"Response: 

Firstly, Edgar withdrew $17 from his account and gave it to his friend. So, his remaining balance was $83 ($100 - $17).

Then, his friend returned $10 to him. So, Edgar's new balance became $93 ($83 + $10).

Now, there are $7 dollars in Edgar's account. Therefore, the amount of money that Edgar had before he withdrew $17 was $66 ($100 - $17)."
"Response: 
Jakari has given 44 push-ups today in class. Debid has also done 58 more push-ups than Jakari. So, Debid has done 102 push-ups (58 + 44) in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Jakari and Debid is 102 - 44 = 58."
"Response: 
Jakari has given 51 push-ups and Debid has given 44 push-ups. So, the total number of push-ups done is:
51 + 44 = 95 push-ups."
"Response: 
Debid has 44 pencils in his bag today.
Out of these, 9 are from Jacky's box.
So, Debid has 44 - 9 = 35 pencils left."
"Response: 
Debid has taken 51 classes today and Jack has taken 49 classes. So, Debid has taught more than Jack.
So, the difference between the number of classes taken by Debid and Jack is:
51 - 49 = 2
Therefore, Debid and Jack have taught 2 classes together."
"Response: 

Total number of push-ups = 59 (as given in the question)
Number of push-ups done by Jacky = 19 (as given in the question)

So, the number of push-ups done by others is:
59 - 19 = 40

Therefore, the answer is 40."
"Response: 

Total number of push-ups = 44 + 17 = 61

Number of push-ups done by Jacky = 29 (as per the question)

So, number of push-ups done by others = Total number of push-ups - Number of push-ups done by Jacky
= 61 - 29
= 32

Therefore, Dean did 32 push-ups."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are 53 students in Jack's class and 14 of them got more than 50% marks in both subjects. So, the number of students who got less than 50% marks in at least one subject is:

Number of students who got less than 50% marks in both subjects = Total number of students - Number of students who got more than 50% marks in both subjects
= 53 - 14
= 39

So, out of 53 students, 39 students got less than 50% marks in at least one subject."
"Response: 
Jackie has taken 35 push-ups and 3 crunches today in his PE class.
The teacher Jackie has, took 58 push-ups and 8 crunches.
So, Jackie has done more push-ups than the teacher (35 vs 58). However, the teacher has done more crunches than Jackie (3 vs 8).
Therefore, Jackie has done 35 + 3 = 38 push-ups and 3 + 8 = 11 crunches."
"Response: 

Jackari has 46 pieces of push-ups and 58 pieces of crunches today.

Out of these, Jackari did 38 push-ups more than crunches.

So, the number of push-ups that Jackari did is:

38 + 58 = 96

Therefore, Jackari did 96 push-ups today."
"Response: 
Jackie took 19 classes today and got 39 push-ups from each class. So he did 685 push-ups in total (19 x 39 = 685).
Now, Dean gave out 39 push-ups more than Jackie. So, Dean gave out 39 + 685 = 724 push-ups in total.
Therefore, Dean gave out 130 more push-ups than Jackie (724 - 685 = 130)."
"Response: 
Jackie took 51 pieces of candy from the jar today. Of those, Dean ate 22 more than Jackie did. So, Dean ate 73 pieces of candy (22 + 51 = 73). John ate fewer candies than Dean, and he ate 4 less than John. Therefore, John ate 69 pieces of candy (73 - 4 = 69).
So, John ate 69 pieces of candy."
"Response: 

15 students from Jack's class went to Jim's class and 39 students from Jim's class came back. So, the total number of students who went to Jim's class is 15 + 39 = 54.
Now, out of these 54 students, 9 students did not go to Jim's class. So, the number of students who went to Jim's class is 54 - 9 = 45.
Therefore, Jack's class has 45 more students than Jim's class."
Response:  Jim has given 30 extra pounds to Debid. If Debid had 37 pounds before and now he has 67 pounds (37 + 30), then Jackari gave 40 extra pounds (67 - 37 = 40).
"Response:  Jim has given 56 push-ups today and Debid has given 38 push-ups. So, if Debid gives 38 more push-ups, then the total number of push-ups done by Debid and Jackari together is:

Debid gave 38 + (56 - 38) = 74 push-ups."
"Response: 
Jim classified 40 items as push and 17 items as pull. If Jack classified 34 items as push and 62 items as pull, then how many items did Jim classify as push?

Therefore, the total number of questions for both homeworks is 7 (3 + 4)."
"Response: 
If we can find 5 correct answers to the first question, then there are 7 options for the second question (as mentioned in the question). So, if we can find 5 correct answers to the second question as well, then there are 7 x 5 = 35 possible combinations of answers that could be correct. Therefore, the probability of getting all 7 correct answers is 1/35 or approximately 0.029."
Response:  If we can solve 7 out of 10 questions correctly, then for each correct answer, we will get 4 marks. So, if we answer 4 questions correctly, we will get 4 x 4 = 16 marks. Now, let's calculate how many questions we need to answer correctly to score 16 marks. Since there are 10 questions in total, we need to answer 16/10 = 1.6 questions correctly to score 16 marks. Therefore, we need to answer 2 questions correctly to score 16 marks.
"Response:  If we have to make 8 pieces of homework for each student in class, and if each piece of homework has 5 questions, then the total number of questions will be:

Therefore, Rajeeb can solve 6/4 = 1 and half problems in one hour."
"Response: 
If Rakesh can complete 10 pages of his homework in 3 hours, then he will take 30 minutes to complete one page of his homework (10/3 = 3).
Now, if Gitanjali can complete 3 pages of her homework in 2 hours, then she will take 60 minutes to complete one page of her homework (3/2 = 1.5).
So, Rakesh takes less time than Gitanjali to complete one page of their homework. Therefore, Rakesh can complete more pages of his homework than Gitanjali in the same amount of time.
To find out how many more pages Rakesh can complete, we need to subtract the number of pages Gitanjali can complete from the total number of pages Rakesh can complete.
Let's assume that Rakesh can complete x pages of his homework in 3 hours, and Gitanjali can complete y pages of her homework in 2 hours. Then, we have the following equation:
x - y = 10
Solving for x, we get:
x = 14
Therefore, Rakesh can complete 14 pages of his homework in 3 hours, while Gitanjali can complete 7 pages of her homework in the same amount of time (14 - 7 = 7)."

"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are two types of work - rechelak and gonit.

Rechelak means to do something repeatedly without any specific goal or purpose in mind. For example, watching TV, playing video games, etc.

Gonit means to perform some task with a specific goal or purpose in mind. For example, studying for an exam, working on a project, etc.

Now, let's calculate the number of hours spent on each type of work based on the information provided:

Rechelak (non-productive work): The person spends 8 hours per day on non-productive work, which is equal to 56 hours per week.

Gonit (productive work): The person spends 10 hours per day on productive work, which is equal to 70 hours per week.

So, the total number of hours spent on both types of work is: 56 + 70 = 126 hours per week."
"Response: 
For 4 years of engineering study, you need to pay around Rs 4 lakh per year as tuition fees in a government college. So, for 4 years, it will be Rs 16 lakhs (Rs 4 lakh x 4 years).
Now, let's calculate the total amount needed for Gyanit and Jibanit education. For Gyanit, you need to spend around Rs 20 thousand per month for 3 years, which is Rs 72 thousand (Rs 20 thousand x 3 years). Similarly, for Jibanit, you need to spend around Rs 15 thousand per month for 4 years, which is Rs 60 thousand (Rs 15 thousand x 4 years). Therefore, the total amount needed for both Gyanit and Jibanit education is Rs 88 thousand (Rs 72 thousand + Rs 60 thousand).
So, the total amount needed for all three stages of education - engineering, Gyanit, and Jibanit - is Rs 16 lakh + Rs 88 thousand = Rs 16.88 lakh."

"Response: 
Given that Ghashfulak has 9 inches of lava flow and Bangali Moghdalasap has 12 inches of lava flow.
To find out how many feet Bangali Moghdalasap's lava flow is more than Ghashfulak's lava flow, we need to convert both measurements to feet.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:
9 inches = 0.75 feet (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
12 inches = 1 foot (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Now, let's subtract the amount of lava flow that Ghashfulak has from Bangali Moghdalasap's lava flow:
1 foot - 0.75 feet = 0.25 feet
So, Bangali Moghdalasap's lava flow is 0.25 feet more than Ghashfulak's lava flow."
Response:  Ghasulkujur gave 31 chains and Bangali Mugdha gave 35 chains. So, if they together gave 66 chains (31 + 35).
Response:  Ghasaphulak has scored 36 laps, and Bongoder has scored 17 more than him, which is equal to 53 laps. Moreover, Maus has scored 15 more than Bongoder, which is equal to 68 laps. Therefore, Bongoder has scored 68 - 53 = 15 laps more than Ghasaphulak.

* ঘাসফলক (Hans) has 25 laps.
* বাংগালি মেঘড়াসপট (Bangali Mugdha) has 18 more laps than Hans.
* মাউস (Mouse) has 36 laps.
Now let's calculate the number of laps each person has:
Hans - 25 laps
Bangali Mugdha - 18 + 25 = 43 laps
Mouse - 36 laps
So, the total number of laps among all three is:
25 + 43 + 36 = 104 laps"

* Banglar (the cat) caught 10 more fish than Ghasaphulak.
* Mouse caught 20 fish from Banglar's place.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish each animal caught:

Ghasaphulak caught 19 fish + 10 more fish = 29 fish.
Banglar caught 10 + 20 = 30 fish.
Mouse caught 20 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by all three animals is:
29 + 30 + 20 = 79 fish."

Now we need to find out how many times longer the human is than the dog and how much shorter the cat is than the dog.
To do this, we can use division.
Length of Human / Length of Dog =?
= 24 / 33 = 0.73
So, the human is approximately 73% longer than the dog.
Similarly, we can find out how much shorter the cat is than the dog using subtraction.
Length of Cat - Length of Dog =?
= 5 - 33 = -28
So, the cat is approximately 28% shorter than the dog."

Now, let's calculate the total number of red and blue balls separately:
Red balls: 12
Blue balls: 23
Now, we need to find out how many red balls are there in 4 excess balls. As there are 4 excess balls, we can deduct 4 from the total number of blue balls:
Excess blue balls = 4
New total number of blue balls = 23 - 4 = 19
So, the number of red balls that were given extra is 4.
Therefore, the answer is 4."

Now we need to find out the area of the H shape and the M shape separately, and then add them up to get the total area of the design.
Area of H shape = length x width = 19 x 4 = 76 square inches
Area of M shape = height x width = 1/2 x 4 = 2 square inches
Total area of the design = Area of H shape + Area of M shape = 76 + 2 = 78 square inches
Therefore, the area of the design is approximately 78 square inches."

Now we need to find out how much H is less than M and L.
To do this, we can use subtraction.
So, H - M =?
Subtracting 25 from 21 gives us:
H - M = 4
Similarly, we can find the difference between H and L as follows:
H - L =?
Subtracting 16 from 21 gives us:
H - L = 5
Therefore, the answer is:
H is 4 inches less than M and 5 inches less than L."
Response:  We know that Bangali Meghdaast has 39 laps and Ghasufalak has 17 laps. So, we need to find out how many times Bangali Meghdaast can cover Ghasufalak's distance in one lap. To do this, we divide the total distance covered by Bangali Meghdaast (39 x 2 = 78) by its own diameter (39). This gives us an average speed of Bangali Meghdaast as 78 / 39 = 2.00 laps per second. Now, let's calculate the time taken for Bangali Meghdaast to cover Ghasufalak's distance of 17 laps. We multiply the average speed of Bangali Meghdaast by the number of laps it takes to cover Ghasufalak's distance, which is 17. Therefore, the time taken by Bangali Meghdaast to cover Ghasufalak's distance is 2.00 x 17 = 34 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the length of Bandar's tail:
Bandar's tail length = Haresh's tail length - 3 inches
= 9 inches - 3 inches
= 6 inches
Now, let's calculate the length of Mouse's tail:
Mouse's tail length = Haresh's tail length + 33 inches
= 9 inches + 33 inches
= 42 inches
So, the length of Mouse's tail is 42 inches."

* Ghasaphulak (G) can lift 14 loads in one trip.
* Maus (M) can lift 16 loads from one place to another.
* From G's location, M lifts 37 loads and brings them to G's location.
Now, let's calculate how many trips M took to bring those 37 loads to G's location:
Trips taken by M = Number of loads lifted / Load capacity of M
= 37 / 16
= 2.25 trips
So, M took approximately 2.25 trips to bring those 37 loads to G's location."
"Response: 

Mercury has 14 capsules and needs to take 6 of them with milk. So far, he has taken 5 capsules with milk. To find out how many more capsules he will need to take, we can subtract the number of capsules he has already taken from the total number of capsules needed.

So, the answer is: Mercury needs 9 more capsules (6 - 5 = 9)."
Response:  The recipe calls for 9 cups of rice and 11 cups of water to make 4 cups of cooked rice. So, if they have already used 4 cups of water, then they will need 7 more cups (11 - 4 = 7) of water to complete the process. Therefore, they will need 7 + 1 (for the remaining 1 cup of uncooked rice) = 8 cups of water in total to cook all 4 cups of uncooked rice.
"Response: 

Mercury is 1/20 of copper in weight. So if it takes 6 cups of mercury to make one cup of copper, it will take 6 x 20 = 120 cups of mercury to make one cup of gold.

Since there are 13 cups of silver in 1 cup of gold, and they have the same density, we can use this ratio to find out how many cups of silver there are in 1 cup of gold. Therefore, for every 1 cup of gold, there are 13 / 1 = 13 cups of silver.

Now, let's calculate how much silver is needed to make 8 more cups of gold than the amount of silver that was used to make 1 cup of gold. Since there are 13 cups of silver in 1 cup of gold, to make 8 more cups of gold means we need 8 x 13 = 104 cups of silver.

So, to make 8 more cups of gold than the amount of silver used to make 1 cup of gold, you would need 104 - 13 = 91 cups of silver."
Response:  Meri has 11 cups of rice and needs to make 7 cups of curry for lunch. She already has 3 cups of water left over from cooking the rice. So she will need an additional 4 cups of water (7 - 3 = 4). Since each cup of curry requires 1/2 cup of water, Meri will need 8 cups of water in total (4 + 4 = 8) to make the curry. Therefore, Meri will use 8 cups of water to make the curry.
Response:  The recipe requires 11 cups of flour and 3 more cups for extra dough. So, in total, the recipe needs 14 cups of flour (11 + 3). If they want to make 6 more batches, each batch will require 2 cups of flour (14 / 7 = 2), so the total amount of flour needed is 14 x 6 = 84 cups.
"Response: 

Merry has 12 cups of rice and wants to make 5 cups of curry. So she will have 7 cups of unused rice (12 - 5 = 7).
Now, if Merry needs another 2 cups of curry, she will use 3 more cups of rice (7 - 2 = 5).
So, in total, Merry will use 5 + 3 = 8 cups of rice for making curry."
Response:  The original recipe calls for 9 cups of rice and 5 cups of chicken. To make 3 more cups of rice, they will need an additional 3 cups of water (since each cup of cooked rice requires about 2 cups of water). So, to make 3 more cups of rice, they will need 6 cups of water in total (3 + 6 = 9). Similarly, to make 6 more cups of chicken, they will need an additional 6 cups of water (since each cup of cooked chicken requires about 1.5 cups of water), so they will need 9 cups of water in total (6 + 9 = 15). Therefore, they will need a total of 15 cups of water to make 3 more cups of both rice and chicken.
Response:  The recipe calls for 5 cups of rice and 14 cups of water. They have already cooked 10 cups of rice and used 2 cups of water. To find out how many more cups they need to add, we can subtract the amount they have already used from the total required: 5 - 2 = 3 cups. So, they will need to add 3 more cups of water to complete the recipe.
Response:  Meri has 12 cups of rice and wants to make 11 more cups. So she needs 1 additional cup of rice. Therefore, the answer is 13 cups of rice will be needed.

Mercury is 10 times denser than water. So, if it takes 7 cups of mercury to fill a container that can hold 80 cups of water, then it will take:

7 x 10 = 70 cups of mercury to fill the same container with water.

Therefore, Mercury has 70/80 = 0.875 or approximately 87.5% more volume than water in the given container."
"Response:  The recipe calls for 12 cups of rice, and they have already cooked 2 cups. So, there are 10 remaining cups to be cooked. To find out how much more rice they need to add to the pot, we can divide the total amount of rice required (12 cups) by the number of cups they have already cooked (2 cups):

12 / 2 = 6

So, they still need to add 6 more cups of rice to the pot to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Meri has 6 cups of rice and wants to make 8 cups of chicken curry. So, she needs 2 more cups of chicken curry. Now, we have 7 cups of lentils left after making 5 cups of chicken curry. To make 8 cups of lentil soup, we need 1 more cup of lentils. Therefore, Meri will need 3 more cups of chicken curry to complete all three dishes (rice, chicken curry, and lentil soup).
Response:  Meri has 12 cups of rice and wants to make 13 portions with each portion containing 2 cups of rice. So she needs 13 x 2 = 26 cups of rice in total. Since she already has 12 cups, she will need an additional 14 cups (26 - 12) of rice to complete her task.
Response:  The recipe calls for 9 cups of rice and 6 cups of water to make 4 cups of cooked rice. So, if they have already used 4 cups of water, then there are still 5 cups of water left (9 - 4 = 5). Therefore, they will need an additional 1 cup of water to complete the recipe (5 + 1 = 6).
"Response:

"Response: 
Merry has 6 cups of tea and wants to make another cup. So she needs 7 more cups of water.
She has 14 cups of milk and uses 60 cups of water to make each cup of tea. Therefore, she will need an additional 6 x 60 = 360 cups of water to make all 7 extra cups of tea."
"Response: 
Merry has 11 cups of coffee and wants to make 12 more cups using the same recipe. So she needs 12 x 11 = 132 cups of water.
Since each cup of coffee requires 9 cups of milk, Merry will need 132 / 9 = 14.89 cups of milk.
So Merry will need 15 cups of milk to make all the cups of coffee."
"Response: 

Mercury is 13 times denser than water. So, if it takes 6 cups of mercury to fill a container that holds 30 cups of water, then it will take how many cups of mercury to fill a container that holds 45 cups of water?

To find out, we can use the ratio of density between mercury and water:

Density of mercury = 13 x Density of water

So, if the density of water is represented as 'd', then the density of mercury becomes 13xd.

Now, let's convert the volume of water from cups to cubic centimeters (cm³):

1 cup = 237 ml (milliliters)

So, 30 cups of water = 30 x 237 ml = 6910 ml

Similarly, for 45 cups of water, we have:

45 cups = 45 x 237 ml = 10855 ml

Now, we need to convert the volume of mercury from cups to cm³:

1 cup = 237 ml

So, 6 cups of mercury = 6 x 237 ml = 1362 ml

Now, we can calculate the ratio of mercury to water using the above values:

Ratio of mercury to water = Volume of mercury / Volume of water
= 1362 ml / 10855 ml
= 0.123

Therefore, to fill a container that holds 45 cups of water, it will take approximately 0.123 x 45 = 5.85 cups of mercury."
Response:  The recipe calls for 9 cups of rice and 14 cups of water to make 40 cups of lobster curry. If they have already used 4 cups of water, then they will need 10 more cups (14 - 4 = 10) of water to complete the recipe. So, they will need 10 + 9 = 19 cups of liquid in total to make the full batch of lobster curry.
"Response: 

Mercury has 9 cups of rice and wants to share it equally among 7 people. So each person will get 1 cup of rice.
Now, Mercury has 4 cups of lentil left, which he wants to distribute among 3 remaining people. Since there are 3 people now, each person will get 1/3 = 0.67 cup of lentils.
So, in total, each person will get 1 + 0.67 = 1.67 cups of food."
Response:  The recipe calls for 11 cups of rice and 6 cups of water to make 12 cups of cooked rice. So, if we want to know how many cups of rice they will have after adding more water, we can multiply the number of cups of rice by the amount of water added. In this case, if they add 9 cups of water, they will have 108 cups of cooked rice (12 x 9 = 108).
Response:  Meri has 7 cups of rice and wants to make 10 cups of kheer. So she needs 3 more cups of milk. Now, she has 4 cups of milk left after making the kheer. Therefore, the answer is 3.

"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of families in the village.
Total number of families = Number of houses x Number of families per house
= 30 houses x 5 families/house
= 150 families
Step 2: Calculate the number of new families that have moved into the village since last Shitikaal (winter).
Number of new families = Total number of families - Families who left the village during Shitikaal
= 150 families - 26 families
= 124 families
Therefore, there are 124 new families that have moved into the village since last Shitikaal."

3. The number of creamy cakes that Polak and his friends shared among themselves = 106 (given)
4. The number of creamy cakes that Polak himself ate = 35 (given)

Now, let's calculate the remaining number of creamy cakes:
Number of creamy cakes left = Total number of creamy cakes - Number of creamy cakes eaten by Polak
= 106 - 35
= 71

Therefore, there were 71 creamy cakes left after Polak and his friends shared them among themselves."
"Response: 

1. Polak's age at his friend's birthday party = 65 years old (given)
2. Number of friends present at the party = 213 people (given)
3. Age difference between Polak and each of his friends = 45 years (based on the fact that they are all older than him)
4. Total number of friends who gave Polak a gift = 16 gifts (based on the information given in the question)
5. Number of gifts received by Polak from his friends = 213 - 16 = 207 gifts (calculated by subtracting the number of gifts he received from the total number of friends present)
6. Percentage of gifts received by Polak out of the total number of gifts given = (207/213) x 100% = 95.8% (calculated by dividing the number of gifts he received by the total number of gifts given and multiplying by 100%)"
"Response: 

1. The person has 589 friends in total.
2. In their lifetime, they have given away 371 of those friendships to others.
3. When they died, they had 160 remaining friends.
4. So, the number of friendships that were lost due to death is 160 - 371 = -211."
"Response: 

1. The person has 110 friends in total.
2. In their lifetime, they have given 412 gifts to their friends.
3. When they were in school (at some point in time), they gave 90 gifts to their friends.

4. Among them, 194720 x 358 = 6835720 overs were bowled by boys.
5. And among them, 194720 x 205 = 3935500 overs were bowled by girls.
6. So, the total number of overs bowled by both boys and girls is 6835720 + 3935500 = 10771220 overs."
"Response: 

1. The person has 52 friends in school.
2. They share their birthdays equally among these 52 friends, so each friend gets one birthday per year (i.e., 52 birthdays).
3. In total, they have shared 52 x 5 = 260 birthdays with their friends.
4. If they had 535 birthdays to give away, and they gave them equally among their 52 friends, then each friend would get 535 / 52 = 10.5 birthdays per person.

So, there are 10.5 birthdays left over after giving them all away."
"Response: 

1. The person has 521 days left in their lifetime.
2. They have 361 days of work remaining (as they have already worked for 160 days).
3. If they work every day until the end of their life, they will have worked for 361 days.
4. Therefore, if any of these 361 working days are missed, it means that the person has less than 361 days of work remaining.

So, the number of working days remaining is 361 - 160 = 191 days."

"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Polak has 601 rupees in his pocket at the beginning of the year.

Then, he spends 406 rupees for some reason. So, now he has 205 rupees left (601 - 406 = 205).

After that, he loses 336 rupees due to some unfortunate event. Now, he has only 71 rupees left (205 - 336 = 71).

Finally, he has 71 rupees with him at the end of the year."
"Response: 
The person has 291 friends in their school days and they have shared 315 posts. So, the number of likes each post gets is:
Number of likes = Number of friends x Number of posts
= 291 x 315
= 87,655
So, the person has received 87,655 likes on their posts."
"Response: 

1. Polak's age at his friend's birthday party = 267 - (friend's age at party)
2. Number of years between Polak's current year and his friend's birthday = current year - friend's birthday year
3. Total number of croreyans in Polak's school = 231 + (number of croreyans in Polak's school when he was born)
4. Number of croreyans who passed in Polak's exam = total number of croreyans in Polak's school x percentage of students passing the exam
5. Number of croreyans whose friends passed in the exam = total number of croreyans in Polak's school x percentage of friends passing the exam

Now let's calculate each value:

1. Polak's age at his friend's birthday party = 267 - (friend's age at party)
Polak is currently 267 years old, and his friend is 308 years old, so Polak's age at the party is 308 - 267 = 41 years.
2. Number of years between Polak's current year and his friend's birthday = current year - friend's birthday year
Currently it is 2023, and Polak's friend was born in 1992, so there are 31 years between their current ages.
3. Total number of croreyans in Polak's school = 231 + (number of croreyans in Polak's school when he was born)
When Polak was born, there were 231 croreyans in his school. Since then, an additional 137 croreyans have been admitted to the school, for a total of 368 croreyans in the school now.
4. Number of croreyans who passed in Polak's exam = total number of croreyans in Polak's school x percentage of students passing the exam
The percentage of students passing the exam is not given in the question, but we can assume that it is the same as the percentage of students passing the previous"

"Response: 
The number of workers in one workshop is 11.
Out of them, 3 went to another workshop.
So, the remaining workers are 8 (11 - 3).
Now, we need to find out how many workers have gone from one workshop to another.
To do this, we will divide the total number of workers who left (3) by the number of workers who remained in the original workshop (8).
So, the ratio of workers who went from one workshop to another is 3/8 or 0.375."
"Response:  The original group of 3 workers had 1 worker more than the remaining 2 groups combined. So, if we add 4 new workers to each of the other two groups, the total number of workers in all three groups will be equal to the original group plus the additional workers added to the other two groups. Therefore, the final number of workers in all three groups is:

Original group = 3 + 1 = 4
Other two groups (combined) = 2 x 4 = 8
Total number of workers = 4 + 8 = 12
So, there are 12 workers in all three groups after adding 4 new workers to each of the other two groups."
Response:  The number of workers at first was 1 person (the owner). Then, 9 more workers joined, making it 10 in total. Later, another 3 workers joined, bringing the total to 13. So, the final number of workers was 13.
Response:  We know that there are 14 workers in total and 5 of them went for lunch. So, the number of workers left behind is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 workers remaining at the workplace.
Response:  The original group of 13 people had 4 new members join them, so now there are 17 people in total (including both old and new members). If 9 of these people left, then the remaining number of people who stayed is 8 (17 - 9 = 8). Therefore, 4 people joined the group.
"Response: 
The original group of workers had 12 people.
Then, 15 new workers joined the group.
Now, there are 14 new workers in addition to the original 12 workers.
So, the total number of workers is:
12 + 15 = 27
Therefore, there are 27 workers in the group now."
Response:  The original owner had 3 friends who visited him every day. After some time, he gained 2 more friends. So, initially there were 3 + 2 = 5 friends. Now, after some time, he lost 1 friend, so now he has 5 - 1 = 4 friends visiting him daily.
"Response: 

Initially, there were 8 workers in the factory.
Then, some of them left and 5 new workers joined.

Therefore, the final number of workers in the factory is 112 (13 + 99)."
"Response: 

Initially, there were 12 workers in the factory.
Some of them left and went to another job (not mentioned how many).
Now, there are 14 workers in the factory.
After some time, 10 new workers joined the factory.
So, the total number of workers in the factory now is:
14 + 10 = 24 workers."
"Response: 
Dan earned $20 for each of his 10 paintings he sold. So, he earned a total of $20 x 10 = $200 from selling those paintings.
Now, he spent $3 per painting to buy materials. So, he spent a total of $3 x 10 = $30 on materials.
So, Dan made a profit of $200 - $30 = $170 from selling those paintings."
Response:  Dan has $40 and gives $3 to Kanchi. So, now Dan has $37 left.
Response:  The total amount of money Dan has is $40. He gives away 99 cents each time he buys something. So, after buying 1 thing, he will have $39.99 left. After buying 2 things, he will have $39.98 left, and so on... Therefore, the final amount of money Dan has after buying 99 things is $39.99 x 99 = $3798.
Response:  Dan paid $3 for one candle bar. He bought 2 candle bars, so he paid $6 (2 x $3).
"Response: 

Dan has $20 and he gives $1 to each of his 20 friends. So, Dan spends $20 - ($1 x 20) = $20 - $20 = $0.

Now, let's calculate how much money each friend gets from Dan:

$20 / 20 friends = $1 per friend

So, Dan gives $1 to each of his 20 friends."
Response:  Dan has $7 in his pocket and he spends $2 of it to buy a canned food. Now he has $5 left. Then, he buys another thing worth $3 from someone else. So, now Dan has $8 with him (including the $2 he spent). Therefore, the amount of money that Bakki received is $8 - $2 = $6.
"Response: 
Dan has $40 in his pocket and he spends $7 on a can of beer. So, Dan now has $33 left ($40 - $7).
Then, he goes to another store and buys an umbrella for $6. So, Dan now has $27 left ($33 - $6).
Therefore, the total amount that Dan spent is $7 + $6 = $13."
"Response: 
Dan has $2 in his pocket and gives $6 to Candee as a loan. Then he takes back $3 from Candee's wallet. So, Dan gave Candee $6 - $3 = $3."
"Response: 
Dan has $5 in his pocket and spends $2 of it. So he has $3 left.
Now, he buys something worth $10 using $3 that he had left. So he pays $7 (=$10 - $3) as tax.
So, Dan paid $7 as tax."
"Response: 

Dan has $40 and gives $8 to his friend. So Dan has $32 left.
Now, his friend gives him $5 back.
So, Dan has $37 now ( $32 + $5).
And then, his other friend gives him $3 more.
So, Dan has $40 now ($37 + $3)."
Response:  The cost of one candle is $3 and Dan bought 5 candles. So, the total cost of 5 candles = $3 x 5 = $15. Now, if he buys another candle after that, the total cost will be $15 + ($4 - $3) = $15 + $1 = $16. Therefore, the price of each candle after the fifth candle = $16.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he wants to share it equally among three of his friends. So, each friend will get $\frac{4}{3} = 1$ dollar. Therefore, the total amount that each friend will get is $1 \times 3 = 3 dollars$.
"Response:  Dan gave $4 to each of his friends, and he had 10 friends in total. So, the total amount of money that Dan gave away is:

$4 x 10 = $40

Now, we are asked how much each friend received from Dan after he gave away $40. To find this out, we need to divide the amount of money that Dan gave away ($40) by the number of friends he gave it to (10):

$40 ÷ 10 = $4 per friend

So, each of Dan's 10 friends received $4 from him."
"Response: 
Dan has $5 in his pocket and spends $3 on candy. So he has $2 left ($5 - $3 = $2).
Now, he buys a can of soda for $7. So he pays $7 from his remaining balance of $2, leaving him with $0 ($2 - $7 = $0)."
"Response: 
Dan has $4 in his pocket and gives $3 to his friend. So Dan now has $1 left.
His friend then returns $2 of the money he borrowed from Dan, so now Dan has $3 + $2 = $5 back.
Therefore, Dan gave his friend $3 - $2 = $1."
"Response: 
Poler had 115 books. He sold one garage full of 78 books. So, he has (115 - 78) = 37 books left with him."
"Response: 

Poler had 137 books in his garage before he sold 105 of them at a discount of 20%. Now, we need to find out how many books Poler originally had.

Let's use the formula for finding the original number of items after a percentage decrease or increase:

Original quantity = (New quantity / Percentage change) x 100

In this case, the new quantity is 105 books, and the percentage change is 20%, which means that the original quantity was 105/20% = 137 books.

So, Poler originally had 137 books in his garage."
"Response: 
Poler had 108 books and gave some to Gargee. We know that after giving some to Gargee, Poler had 62 books left. So, initially, Poler had 108 - 6 = 42 books with him. Now, let's find out how many books Gargee got from Poler. Gargee received 35 books from Poler, so initially, Gargee had 0 books with him (since he didn't have any books before). Therefore, the total number of books Gargee got from Poler is 35."
"Response: 
Poler had 50 books. Gargee sold some of them and now has 151 books. So, Poler gave Gargee 36 books (50 - 151 = -36). Therefore, Gargee has 187 books (151 + 36 = 187)."
"Response: 
Poler had two books. He sold one of them for Tk. 150 and bought five new books worth Tk. 320. Now he has 58 books in total. So, Poler bought three new books."
"Response: 

Initially, Poler had 21 books in his collection. Gargee sold some of them and earned Rs 420. Now, Poler has 15 books left in his collection.

So, the number of books that Gargee sold is:

21 - 15 = 6

Therefore, Gargee sold 6 books."
"Response: 
Garage had 71 books initially.
He sold some of them and earned $38.
Now he has 116 books in his garage.
So, the number of books Garage sold = 116 - 71 = 45 books."
"Response: 
Poler had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of his books, he had 66 books and 39 pens left.
Garage Sale sold 42 books and 27 pens. So, after Garage Sale's sale, Poler had 66 - 42 = 24 books and 39 + 27 = 66 pens.
Therefore, Garage Sale sold 24 books and 27 pens."
"Response: 
Poler had 51 books and 106 pages. Garage Sale sold some of them and got 82 books and 14 pages back. So, we need to find out how many books Poler originally had and how many he got back from the garage sale.
Let's use algebraic notation to represent this problem:
Books = 51 (initial)
Pages = 106 (initial)
Sold = x (books) + y (pages)
New Books =?
New Pages =?
From the information given in the question, we know that Sold = 82 books and 14 pages.
So, we can set up an equation based on these values:
x + y = 82... (1)
Now, let's solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Since there are more constraints than variables, we will use substitution method here.
Substituting equation (1) into the first constraint, we get:
51 - x = 106 - y
Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
x = 55
Now, substituting x = 55 into equation (1), we get:
y = 27
Therefore, Poler originally had 55 books and got 27 books back from the garage sale."
Response:  The person has sold 27 books and earned $360 as profit. If they had sold 136 books at the same price, their total earnings would be $136 x 136 = $18,544. So, they have sold 109 more books than what they actually sold.
"Response: 
Poler had 134 books. He gave one of his friends 39 books and another friend 20 books. How many books does Poler have left?
Poler has 134 - (39 + 20) = 85 books left."
"Response: 
Poler had 95 books and 153 pens. After giving some of his books to Gargee, he has 78 books left. If Gargee gave some of Poler's books back to him, then Poler now has 95 + (78 - 23) = 95 + 55 = 140 books.
So, Gargee gave 23 books back to Poler."
"Response: 
Poler had 42 books and 143 pens. After giving some of his books to Gargee, Poler has 31 books and 19 pens left. Now, let's find out how many books Gargee took from Poler.
Gargee gave some of Poler's books to his friends, so the number of books Gargee took is equal to the difference between the total number of books he had (143) and the number of books he gave away (31). Therefore, the answer is 112 books."
"Response: 
Firstly, Jesica had 10 flowers in her bag and she gave 8 of them to Fuldaani. So, now Jesica has 2 flowers left (10 - 8 = 2).

"Response:  We know that initially there were 12 flowers in the basket (as per the question). Now, we are told that after some time, 10 more flowers bloomed in the same basket, making it 21 flowers in total. So, the number of flowers in the bag now is:

21 - 12 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 flowers in the bag other than the initial 12."
"Response: 

Initially, there were 15 grapes and 62 arkis in the basket.
Then, Jesika took some of those grapes and arkis from the basket and put them into her pocket. We don't know exactly how many she took, but we can assume it was around half of what was initially in the basket (i.e., 15/3 = 5 grapes and 62/2 = 31 arkis). So, after taking some from the basket, Jesika had 10 grapes and 31 arkis in her pocket.
Now, let's consider what happened next. The passage says that Jesika added 17 more grapes and 96 more arkis to the basket. This means that the total number of grapes in the basket increased by 17, and the total number of arkis increased by 96.
So, at this point, the basket contained 10 + 17 = 27 grapes and 31 + 96 = 127 arkis.
Finally, the passage states that there are now 17 grapes and 62 arkis in the basket. Therefore, the final count of grapes is 27 - 17 = 10, and the final count of arkis is 127 - 62 = 65."
"Response: 

Initially, there were 12 golaps and 2 arkis. So, the total number of items was 12 + 2 = 14.

Then, 10 more golaps and 21 more arkis were added to the box. So, the updated total number of items is 14 + 10 = 24 and 2 + 21 = 23 respectively.

Therefore, the number of arkis in the box is 23."
"Response: 

Initially, there were 5 flowers and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jesica took some more flowers from the bag and added them to the vase. So, after adding new flowers, the total number of flowers in the vase became 12 + 3 = 15.

Now, we need to find out how many orchids are left in the vase after adding new flowers. Since there were initially 3 orchids, and Jesica took none of them, so the number of orchids remaining in the vase is still 3.

So, the final answer is:

Flowers in the vase = 15
Orchids in the vase = 3"
"Response: 

Firstly, there were 7 flowers in the vase and 12 ornaments on the table. So, the total number of items was 7 + 12 = 19.

Then, 3 more flowers were added to the vase, making it 7 + 3 = 10. And 6 more ornaments were placed on the table, so the total number of items became 10 + 6 = 16.

Now, 11 more flowers are added to the vase, taking the total count to 10 + 11 = 21. And 20 more ornaments are placed on the table, increasing the total number of items to 21 + 20 = 41.

So, the final answer is 41."

Dan has 66 bottles of beer in his fridge and he drank 25 of them. So, there are 41 bottles of beer left in the fridge.
Now, we need to find out how many caps were on each bottle.
Let's assume that Dan had x caps on each bottle.
So, the total number of caps = x x 41 = xxxx

Since Dan drank 25 bottles, he must have drunk x/41 caps per bottle.
Therefore, the number of caps Dan drank = x/41 x 25 = xxx."
Response:  If they have found 32 pieces of evidence in one park and 25 pieces of evidence in another park, then there are a total of 57 pieces of evidence (32 + 25). So, if they have searched all three parks, then the number of pieces of evidence found is 178 (57 x 3 = 178).

Dan had 60 old caps and gave away 58 of them. So he has 2 remaining old caps.
Now, Dan got 67 new caps.
So, the total number of caps Dan has is:
2 (old) + 67 (new) = 69 caps."
"Response: 
Dan had 6 old caps and gave 50 new caps to Park. So, Dan has 6 + 50 = 56 caps now. When he gave those new caps to Park, Park already had 60 caps in his collection. Therefore, after giving the new caps to Park, Dan still has 56 - 60 = -4 caps less than what Park has."
"Response: 

Dan has 54 old caps and gives 48 new caps to Park. So, Dan had 52 caps in total (54 - 16 = 52). Now, he gave 48 of those caps to Park, so Dan has 52 - 48 = 4 caps left."
"Response: 

The number of capsules in the first box is 82.
The number of capsules in each subsequent box is 16 less than the previous box (i.e., 82 - 16 = 66, 66 - 16 = 50, etc.).
Therefore, the total number of capsules in all boxes is:
82 + 66 + 50 +... + 42 = 392
So, there were 392 capsules in total."
"Response: 

1. The number of capsules in Dan's bag is 66.
2. Park has 39 capsules and 16 replicas of those capsules.
3. So, the total number of capsules that Park has is 39 + 16 = 55.
4. Now, we need to find out how many original capsules are left after Dan took some from Park.
	* Dan took 16 capsules from Park.
	* After taking, Dan had 66 - 16 = 50 capsules left.

Therefore, the answer is 50."
"Response: 
The total number of caps in the park is 46 + 50 = 96.

"Response: 

Dan has 15 caps of bottles and 18 reporters. He gives 67 reporters and 35 bottle caps to each of his friends. So, how many bottle caps does Dan have left?

Let's count the number of bottle caps Dan has given away:

67 x 3 = 191 bottle caps

Now, let's subtract the number of bottle caps Dan gave away from the total number of bottle caps he had:

15 + 18 - 191 = 0

So, Dan has no bottle caps left!"
"Response: 
Jack has 11 coins in his pocket and he takes out 3 coins from there. So, now Jack has 8 coins left in his pocket.
Now, let's consider the number of coins that Steve has. According to the problem statement, Steve has 17 coins in his pocket.
So, if we subtract the number of coins that Jack took (3) from the total number of coins that Steve has (17), we get:
17 - 3 = 14
Therefore, Steve has 14 coins in his pocket."
"Response: 
Jack has 7 cents in his pocket and he gives 3 cents to his friend. So Jack now has 7 - 3 = 4 cents left.
Now, Jack meets another person who owes him 10 cents. So Jack gets 10 + 4 = 14 cents from this person.
So, at the end of these transactions, Jack has 14 cents in total."
Response:  The total number of jackets in Jake's closet is 18 more than the number of jackets in Gil's closet. So, if there are x jackets in Gil's closet, then there will be 18 + x jackets in Jake's closet. Now, we know that Jake has 19 jackets in his closet, so the number of jackets in Gil's closet must be 13 less than the number of jackets in Jake's closet. Therefore, the answer is 13.
"Response:  We have to find out how many people are in Jack's village. So, we need to know how many houses there are in the village and then calculate the number of people per house. Let's assume that each house has an average of 5 members (including children). Now, let's count the total number of houses in the village:

1. There is one big house where Jack lives with his family.
2. There are 3 small huts near the river. Each hut can accommodate around 4-5 people. Therefore, there are 3 x 5 = 15 people living in those huts.
3. There are 7 medium-sized houses in the village. Each house can accommodate around 6-7 people. Therefore, there are 7 x 6 = 42 people living in those houses.

Now, let's add up all these numbers:
Total number of houses = 1 + 3 + 7 = 11
Total number of people in the village = 15 + 42 = 57
Therefore, there are 57 people living in Jack's village."
Response:  We know that in Jack's stitches, there are 12 pieces of candy. Out of those, 11 pieces are from the jacket and 1 piece is from the pouch. So, the total number of candies in Jack's stitches is 11 + 1 = 12.
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 less pencils than Steve and 3 more pencils than Jill. So, if Steve has x pencils, then Jack has x - 7 pencils. And if Jill has y pencils, then Jack has y + 3 pencils. Now we are given that the total number of pencils in the class is 16. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x - 7) + (y + 3) = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, Steve has 8 pencils, Jill has 5 pencils, and Jack has 1 pencil.
"Response: 
Jack has 7 pencils in his pocket and 8 pencils in his bag. So, he has a total of 15 pencils (7 + 8 = 15).
Now, let's calculate how many pencils Jack has in his school bag. Since he has 17 pens in his school bag, each pen represents 2 pencils. Therefore, Jack has 17 x 2 = 34 pencils in his school bag.
So, to summarize, Jack has 15 pencils in his pocket and 34 pencils in his school bag, for a total of 49 pencils."
Response:  We know that in Jack's stitches, there are 9 less pice than in Jil's stitches. So, in Jack's stitches, each pice is worth $0.90. In Jil's stitches, each pice is worth $1.80. Now we need to find out how many pices are there in Jack's stitches. According to the question, there are 16 pieces in Jack's stitches. Therefore, the number of pices in Jil's stitches = Number of pices in Jack's stitches x Price of one pice in Jil's stitches / Price of one pice in Jack's stitches = 16 x ($1.80 / $0.90) = 24.
"Response: 
Jack has 6 apples in his bag and he gives 3 to Jill. So Jack now has 6 - 3 = 3 apples left.
Jill gets 18 apples from her share of the bag. Since she already had 5 apples, she now has 18 + 5 = 23 apples.
So, Jack has 3 apples left and Jill has 23 apples."
"Response: 
Jack has 5 pices of candy from Jack's store in his pocket. From there he takes out 3 pieces and gives it to Sarah. So now Jack has 2 pieces of candy left in his pocket.
Now let's come to Steve's store. Steve has 18 pieces of candy in his store. He sells 6 pieces of candy to Tom. Now Steve has 12 pieces of candy left in his store.
Now we have to find out how many pieces of candy Steve has left after giving some to Tom. We know that Steve gave 6 pieces of candy to Tom, so now Steve has 12 - 6 = 6 pieces of candy left in his store.
So finally, Jack has 2 pieces of candy left in his pocket, and Steve has 6 pieces of candy left in his store."
"Response: 
Jack has 16 apples in his bag and he gives 3 to Jill. So Jack now has 16 - 3 = 13 apples left.
Jill gets 5 apples from Jack, so she now has 5 + 3 = 8 apples.
Now, if Jill had 12 apples before giving 3 to Jack, then she now has 12 - 3 = 9 apples left.
Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jack has and the number of apples Jill has is 13 - 9 = 4 apples."
"Response: 
Jack has 12 toys in his room and he gave away 7 of them. So, Jack now has 5 toys left (12 - 7 = 5).
Now, there are 19 toys in the closet, including the ones that Jack gave away. So, the number of toys that Jack has is equal to the number of toys in the closet minus the number of toys that Jack gave away.
So, the answer is:
Number of toys that Jack has = Number of toys in the closet - Number of toys given away
= 19 - 7
= 12
Therefore, Jack has 12 toys in total."
"Response: 
Jack has 13 apples and gives 3 to Jill. So Jack has 10 apples left (13 - 3 = 10).
Jill gets 8 apples from Jack, so she has 8 apples in total (0 + 8 = 8).
Now, let's calculate how many apples Jack has after giving some to Jill:
Jack had 10 apples initially, then he gave 3 to Jill, so now he has 7 apples left (10 - 3 = 7).
Therefore, Jack has 7 apples left."
"Response: 
Jack has 6 more apples than Jackie. So, Jack has 8 + 6 = 14 apples in total.
Jackie has 17 - 6 = 11 apples in total.
So, there are 11 apples less in Jackie's basket than in Jack's basket."
"Response: 
Jack has 30 coins in his pocket and gives away 10 of them to Jill. So, Jack now has 20 coins left (30 - 10 = 20).
Jill gets 12 coins from Jack, so she has 12 + 10 = 22 coins in total.
Now, let's find out how many coins each of them has after the exchange:
Jack has 20 coins left, and he gave away 10 of them, so he has 20 / 2 = 10 coins left with him.
Jill got 12 coins from Jack and already had 10 coins, so she has 12 + 10 = 22 coins in total."
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that there are 12 am in Jack's watch.
Step 2: From the problem statement, we know that 4 of them are smaller than the ones from Jil's town. So, the number of larger am in Jack's watch is 12 - 4 = 8.
Step 3: Now, we know that there are 67 more am in Jil's town than in Jack's watch. So, the total number of am in Jack's watch is 8 + 67 = 75.
Therefore, Jack has 75 am in his watch."
"Response: 
From Jack's stitches, 12 are less than 18, which means that 6 of them are more than 18 (since there are 18 - 12 = 6).
Now, from Jack's stitches, 9 are from his jacket's sleeve, which means that 3 of them are not from his jacket's sleeve (since there are 9 - 3 = 6).
So, from Jack's jacket, 3 stitches are missing."
"Response: 
From Jack's stitches, 19 are small and 12 are big. So, in total, Jack has 31 stitches.
Now, from Jill's stitches, 72 are small and 58 are big. So, in total, Jill has 130 stitches.
Therefore, Jack has 31 stitches and Jill has 130 stitches."
"Response: 
From Jack's stitches, 6 are less and from Jill's stitches, 3 are more than Jack's stitches. So, the number of stitches that Jill has is:
Jill's stitches = Jack's stitches - 6 + 3 = 14 - 6 + 3 = 5
Therefore, Jill has 5 stitches."
"Response:  We know that Jack has 84 apples and 10 pears in his basket. The weight of an apple is 130 grams, and the weight of a pear is 170 grams. So, the total weight of all fruits in Jack's basket is:

Apple weight = 84 x 130 g = 10,696 g
Pear weight = 10 x 170 g = 1,700 g
Total fruit weight = Apple weight + Pear weight = 10,696 g + 1,700 g = 12,396 g
Now we need to find out how much water Jack has in his bottle. According to the question, he has 52 ml of water in his bottle. Since there are 1000 milliliters in one liter, we can convert 52 ml to liters as follows:

52 ml / 1000 = 0.052 liters
So, Jack has 0.052 liters of water in his bottle."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are 13 apples and 8 pears in Jack's basket. So, the total number of fruits is 13 + 8 = 21.

Now, let's find out how many apples and pears Jack has. We can do this by dividing the total number of fruits by the number of each fruit.

Apples: 21 / 3 (number of apples) = 7
Pears: 21 / 2 (number of pears) = 10

So, Jack has 7 apples and 10 pears in his basket."
"Response: 
Jack has 8 apples in his pocket and gives 4 to Jill. So Jack now has 8 - 4 = 4 apples left.
Jill gets 6 apples from Jack, so she now has 6 + 4 = 10 apples.
Now, Jack goes to Steve and gives him 2 apples. So Jack now has 4 - 2 = 2 apples left.
Steve gets 3 apples from Jack, so he now has 3 + 2 = 5 apples.
Therefore, the total number of apples that Jack, Jill, and Steve have is:
Jack: 2 apples
Jill: 10 apples
Steve: 5 apples"
"Response: 
Jack has 3 apples and 4 bananas in his basket. The total number of fruits he has is 7 (3 + 4).
Now, from Jack's basket, 19 fruits are taken out, including 15 apples and 4 bananas. So, the remaining fruits in Jack's basket are 6 (19 - 15 = 6).
Therefore, among the fruits that remain in Jack's basket, there are more apples than bananas."
"Response: 
The original amount was $78.
After paying $15 as supermarket bill, the remaining amount is $63.
So, the person has $63 - $15 = $48 left in their wallet."
"Response: 
The supermarket owner has $78 in his pocket. If he spends $33 of that amount, how much will be left with him?
So, the amount left with the supermarket owner is $45 ($78 - $33)."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Oliva spent $100 at Walmart. Then, she got a discount of $48, so she paid $52 for her purchase.

Now, let's find out how much money Olivia made from selling her old laptop. According to the problem, she sold it for $159. So, she earned $159 - $52 = $107.

Therefore, Olivia made $107 in total."
"Response: 

Firstly, Oliva spent $30 at Walmart.
Then, he got a discount of 20% and paid $49 for the item.
Now, let's find out how much money Olivia saved after buying the item from Supermarket.

Cost price = Original price - Discount amount
= $49 - ($49 x 20%)
= $49 - $9.8
= $40.20

So, Olivia saved $40.20 after buying the item from Supermarket."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Oliva spent $53 dollars at Walmart and bought $91 worth of items. So, the total amount he spent is $53 + $91 = $144.

Now, let's find out how much Supermarket charged him for each dollar he spent. We are given in the problem that Supermarket charges an additional $0.14 per dollar. So, if Oliva spent $x dollars, then Supermarket charged him $x x $0.14 = $0.14x dollars.

Since Oliva spent $144 dollars, Supermarket charged him $144 x $0.14 = $20.16 dollars extra.

Therefore, the final amount Oliva paid to Supermarket is $144 (the amount he spent) + $20.16 (the extra charge) = $164.16 dollars."
"Response: 
Firstly, Oliva spent $106 at Supermarket and then he got a discount of $26. So, he paid $80 for the items in the supermarket.
Now, if Olivia bought $49 worth of goods from the store, then he paid $49 x 80 = $3720 to the store."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Oliva has $29 in her supermarket bag.

Now, if she spends $54 at the checkout, how much will be left in her bag after payment?

So, the amount left in her bag is $29 - $54 = $-25.

Therefore, Olivia has lost $25 from her original amount of $29."
"Response: 
The supermarket owner has $38 in his wallet and he wants to buy an item worth $128. So, he will have to pay with a credit card or cash. If he pays with cash, he will have $90 left ($38 + $128 - $128). If he pays with a credit card, he will have $0 left ($38 + $128 = $166) because he already spent all of his money."

Firstly, there were 15 apps installed on Dev's phone. Then, he downloaded and installed 7 new apps. After that, some of these apps got uninstalled, leaving him with 14 apps remaining. So, the number of apps that Dev had after uninstalling some is 14."
"Response: 

The person has 16 apps and 77 files in their phone. After deleting some of them, they have 5 apps and 23 files left. So, the number of apps that were deleted is 16 - 5 = 11. And the number of files that were deleted is 77 - 23 = 54."
"Response: 

Firstly, there were 17 apps and 23 files in Devender's phone.
After some time, he deleted 3 apps and 7 files from his phone.
So, now there are 14 apps (17 - 3) and 16 files (23 - 7).
Therefore, the number of apps that Devender had after deleting some files is 14, and the number of files that he had after deleting some apps is 16."
"Response: 

Firstly, there were 15 apps and 24 files in the phone before some of them were deleted. So, initially, there were 15 x 24 = 360 items in the phone.

Now, after some apps and files were deleted, there are only 13 apps and 19 files left in the phone. Therefore, the number of items remaining in the phone is 13 x 19 = 227.

So, the difference between the initial number of items (360) and the current number of items (227) is 360 - 227 = 133."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that there were 19 apps and 18 files in Dev's phone before he deleted some of them. So, initially, there were 19 x 18 = 352 items in his phone.

Now, after deleting some apps and files, there are 19 - 6 = 13 apps and 18 - 3 = 15 files left in his phone. Therefore, the current number of items in Dev's phone is 13 x 18 = 204.

So, the difference between the initial number of items (352) and the current number of items (204) is 352 - 204 = 148."
"Response: 

Firstly, there were 17 apps on Devender's phone.
After some time, he added 18 more apps to his phone.
So, in total, Devender had 35 apps (17 + 18) on his phone."
"Response: 

The person has 59 files and 15 apps in their phone. After deleting some of them, they have 30 apps and 20 files left. So, the number of apps that were deleted is 15 - 30 = -15 apps.
Similarly, the number of files that were deleted is 59 - 20 = -39 files.
Therefore, the person deleted 15 apps and 39 files from their phone."
"Response: 

The person has 24 files and 13 apps on their phone. After deleting some of them, they have 17 apps and 21 files left. So, the total number of files that were deleted is 6 (21 - 15 = 6)."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are 24 apps and 9 files in Devender's phone. After deleting some of them, 5 files and 12 apps were left on his phone. So, initially, there were 24 + 9 = 33 items (apps or files) in Devender's phone.

Now, let's find out how many apps and files are left after some of them were deleted. We know that 5 files and 12 apps were deleted from Devender's phone. So, the number of remaining files is 9 - 5 = 4, and the number of remaining apps is 24 - 12 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Apps: 12
Files: 4"
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that there were 11 apps and 3 files in Dev's phone before he deleted some of them. So, initially, there were 11 + 3 = 14 items in his phone.

Now, after deleting some of the apps and files, there are 24 items left in his phone. This means that Dev has added 24 - 14 = 10 new apps and files to his phone.

So, the final number of apps and files in Dev's phone is 10 + 3 = 13."

3. Now he has 428 cards left (438 - 10 = 428).
4. Out of these 428 cards, he gave away 19 cards to his friends again.
5. So now he has 409 cards left (428 - 19 = 409).
6. The remaining cards are either 10 or 178.

Therefore, the number of cards that Neil has is:

10 + 178 = 188

So, Neil has 188 cards left with him."
"Response: 
Neel has 239 cards in total and he distributed them equally among his friends. So each friend got 10 cards (since there are 239 / 23 = 10).
Now Neel had 376 cards left, which he again distributed equally among his remaining friends. Each friend got 111 cards (since there are 376 / 3 = 111).
So Neel's current card collection is 376 + 111 = 487 cards."

"Response: 
Pako had 40 cookies and shared them equally among his 2 friends. So each friend got 20 cookies (40/2 = 20).
Now Pako took back 17 of those cookies from one of his friends. So the remaining number of cookies with that friend is 37 - 17 = 20.
So the total number of cookies left with Pako and his other friend is 20 + 20 = 40."
"Response: 

Pako had 25 cookies and shared them equally among 5 of his friends. So each friend got 5 cookies.
Then Pako took 3 more cookies from the remaining 10 cookies (he had 25 - 5 = 20 cookies). Now he has 3 + 10 = 13 cookies left.
So the number of cookies that Pako has now is 13."
"Response: 

Pako has 13 coins in total. He gives away 2 coins to someone else. Now Pako has 11 coins left.

Then, he gets 36 more coins from somewhere. So, Pako now has 47 coins in total (11 + 36).

So, the answer is 47."
"Response: 
Pakor had 40 cookies and gave 5 to his friend. So, he has 35 cookies left. Then, he distributed 13 more cookies among his other friends. Therefore, Pakor now has 22 cookies left (35 - 13 = 22)."

"Response: 
Gowain's mother gave him $8. His father took $5 from Gowain and gave it to his mother. If Gowain had $4 left, how much did his mother give his father?

Solution:
Let's break down the given information:

* Gowain received $8 from his mother.
* His father took $5 from Gowain, so now Gowain has $3 ($8 - $5).
* Gowain's mother gave his father $4.

Now we can calculate how much money Gowain's mother gave to his father:
$4 (amount given to father) = $3 (remaining amount with Gowain) + $5 (initial amount taken by father)
$4 = $3 + $5
$1 = $2

So, Gowain's mother gave his father $2."
"Response: 
Gowain's mother gave him $3 from her own pocket. Gowain's father gave him $6 more than what his mother gave him. If Gowain gave $4 as a gift to someone, then how much did his father give him?

So, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
$3 + ($6 - $4) =?

Solving for the value of $6 - $4, we get:
$6 - $4 = $2

Therefore, Gowain's father gave him $2 more than what his mother gave him. So, the total amount that Gowain's father gave him is:
$3 + $2 = $5

So, the correct answer is $5."

Bekaar has 133 coins and he gives 51 of them to his friend. So Bekaar has 82 coins left (133 - 51 = 82).
Now, if Bekaar's friend also gives some coins to him, then Bekaar will have more coins than before. Let's say his friend gave him 27 coins. So now Bekaar has 109 coins (82 + 27 = 109).
So, in total, Bekaar received 27 coins from his friend and he already had 82 coins, so altogether he has 109 coins."
"Response: 
Becker has 54 tiles and he distributed them among 3 people in the ratio of 13:20:8. So, each person got 13/54 = 1/4 of Becker's total number of tiles.
Now, if there are 13 more tiles than before, then the new total number of tiles is 54 + 13 = 67.
So, Becker gave away 67 - (1/4) × 54 = 49 tiles."
"Response: 
Becker has sold 145 pieces of cake and he has 72 pieces left. So, if Becker had sold all his remaining cakes (72), then he would have sold a total of 145 + 72 = 217 pieces of cake in total."
"Response: 
Bekaar has 155 friends and each of them gave him 140 coins. So, Bekaar received a total of.......................coins.
Now, we need to find out how many coins Bekaar got from his friends. To do this, we will divide the number of coins he received (155) by the number of friends he had (140).
So, the number of coins Bekaar got from his friends is..............coins."
"Response: 
Becker has sold 121 t-shirts and made $105 in profit. He then spent $70 on new inventory. So Becker has $38 left after spending money on new inventory."
"Response: 
Becker had 13 cats and sold 91 of them. He also bought 154 new cats. So, in total, Becker has 245 cats (91 + 154)."
"Response: 
Becker sold 170 t-shirts at $25 each and made a profit of $38 per shirt. He then reduced the price to $15 each and sold 78 more t-shirts, making a profit of $24 per shirt. So, in total, Becker made a profit of $62 per t-shirt ($38 + $24).
Now, let's calculate how many t-shirts Becker sold in total:
170 (initial sale) + 78 (additional sale) = 248 t-shirts
So, Becker sold 248 t-shirts in total."
"Response: 
Becker has invested $110 in each of the first 110 tickets. So he has invested a total of $110 x 110 = $12,100.
Now, out of these 110 tickets, 75 have won, so Becker has earned a profit of $75 x 75 = $5,625 from these tickets.
So, the remaining 35 tickets have lost, and Becker has invested $110 x 35 = $3,850 in them.
Therefore, Becker will have a total of $12,100 - $3,850 = $8,250 left after investing in the remaining tickets."
"Response: 
Becker bought 144 tiles and sold them for $71 each. He made a profit of $30 per tile. So he earned a total profit of $4280 ($71 x 144).
Now, Becker had 111 tiles left after selling 144 tiles. If he sold those remaining tiles at the same price as before, then his profit from those tiles would be $30 x 111 = $3330.
So, in total, Becker earned a profit of $4280 + $3330 = $7610."
"Response: 
Becker has 149 coins and he exchanges 10 of them with Pastry. So Becker now has 139 coins left.
Then, Becker gives 91 coins to Pasta. Now Becker has 48 coins left (139 - 91 = 48).
So, there are 48 coins left with Becker after both exchange and giving."
"Response: 
Becker has 70 coins and he exchanges them with 148 people. If Becker gave 15 coins to each person, then the total number of coins given away is:
70 x 15 = 1050 coins
So, there are 1050 coins left with Becker after giving them all away."
"Response: 
Becker has 126 keys and 48 passports. If he gives away 115 keys and 81 passports, then how many keys does Becker have left?
So, Becker has 31 keys left (126 - 115 = 31).
Now, let's calculate how many passports Becker has left. If he gave away 81 passports, then he has 67 passports left (48 - 81 = -23). Since negative numbers are not possible in this case, we can conclude that Becker has no passports left. Therefore, Becker has 31 keys left."
"Response: 
Becker has 190 coins and he exchanges them with 131 people. If each person gets an equal number of coins (70), then Becker will have given away 70 x 131 = 9170 coins in total. So, the remaining coins that Becker has after giving them away are 190 - 9170 = 8260 coins."
"Response: 
Becker has 157 tiles and transfers 169 tiles to his friend. So, he has 12 tiles less than what he transferred.
Now, if Becker had 158 tiles and transferred 147 tiles to his friend, how many tiles would he have left?
Solution: To find out how many tiles Becker has left after transferring 147 tiles, we need to subtract the number of tiles he transferred from the total number of tiles he had.
So, 158 - 147 = 11.
Therefore, Becker has 11 tiles left after transferring 147 tiles to his friend."
"Response: 
Becker has 54 coins and he exchanged them for 143 coins. So, if Becker had 68 coins and exchanged them for 92 coins, then how many coins did he get in exchange?
Let X be the number of coins that Becker got in exchange.
From the given information, we know that Becker had 68 coins initially and exchanged them for 92 coins. So, the total number of coins that Becker had after the exchange is:
68 + 92 = 160
Now, let's find out how many coins Becker got in exchange:
X = Total number of coins received - Initial number of coins
= 160 - 68
= 92
Therefore, Becker got 92 coins in exchange."
"Response:  If Bekaar has 44 tikis of rice and he gives 48 tikis to his friend, then after giving it to his friend, Bekaar will have how many tikis of rice left?

Solution: After giving 48 tikis to his friend, Bekaar will have 44 - 48 = -4 tikis of rice left. So, there will be -4 tikis of rice left with Bekaar."
Response:  If Bekaar has 80 tikis of rice and he distributed them among 40 people in his first distribution, then each person got 2 tikis (since there are 80 / 40 = 2 tikis per person). Now, if Bekaar distributed the remaining 40 tikis among the same 40 people again, then each person will get 1 tiki more than before, since there are now only 40 tikis left to distribute among 40 people (i.e., 40 / 40 = 1 tiki per person). Therefore, the total number of tikis that each person received from Bekaar is: 2 + (1 x 40) = 40 tikis.
"Response:  If Becker has 137 friends and each of them gives him $169 as a gift, then Becker will receive a total amount of:

$137 x 137 = $18,059

So, there will be $18,059 in Becker's account after his friends give him gifts."
"Response: 
Becker has 173 cakes and he gives 103 new cakes to his friends. So, Becker now has 70 cakes left (173 - 103 = 70).
Now, out of those 70 cakes, Becker sells 86 cakes, so he is left with 44 cakes (70 - 86 = 44)."
"Response: 
Becker has 99 cents and he spends 167 cents to buy new coins. So, his remaining amount of money is 99 - 167 = -68 cents.
Now, Becker buys 89 cents worth of goods from a store. So, his remaining amount of money after this transaction is -68 + 89 = 21 cents."
"Response: 
Becker has invested $800 in 139 new shares and sold 145 existing shares, resulting in a profit of $139. So, Becker made a total profit of $139 x 2 = $278. Therefore, Becker has invested $278 in additional shares."

Peka has 62 tiles and makes 149 more tiles. So, he now has 211 tiles in total.
Then, he sells 144 of those tiles at 50 taka each, earning 7,200 taka.
Now Peka is left with 211 - 144 = 67 tiles.
So, there will be 67 tiles left with Peka after he sells all his tiles."
"Response: 
Becker took 81 coins and traded them for 92 coins. Then he traded those 92 coins for 46 more coins. So Becker has a total of 137 coins now (81 + 92 + 46 = 137).
So, among all the people mentioned in the question, Becker has the most number of coins - 137 coins."
"Response: 
Becker has 61 pieces of candy and wants to share them equally among 167 people. So he will have to give each person an average of 0.36 pieces of candy (61/167).
Now, if Becker gives 108 pieces of candy to some other people, he will be left with 44 pieces of candy (61 - 108 = 44)."
"Response: 
Becker has 56 pieces of jewelry and sells 124 pieces. So he has 70% left which is equal to 38 pieces (56 - 124 = 70)."
"Response: 
Becky has 52 cards in total and she deals 8 of them face up to create a tableau. So, there are 44 cards left in her deck.
Now, if Becky draws 10 cards from the remaining deck (which contains 44 cards) and lays them out face up to create another tableau, then there will be 34 cards left in the deck after that.
So, the final number of cards that Becky has drawn is 10 + 34 = 44 cards."
"Response: 
Becky has 134 pieces of jewelry and 110 pieces of clothing. If she sold 140 pieces of jewelry and 92 pieces of clothing, then how many pieces of each did she sell?
To find out, we need to subtract the number of pieces Becky had from the total number of pieces she sold.
So, for jewelry: 140 - 134 = 6
And for clothing: 92 - 110 = -18
Therefore, Becky sold 6 pieces of jewelry and -18 pieces of clothing."
"Response: 
Becky has 14 coins of one type and 153 coins of another type. If she exchanged 8 coins of the first type for 97 coins of the second type, then how many coins of the second type did Becky have initially?
Let's assume that the number of coins of the second type is x. Then we know that Becky had 153 - x coins of the second type initially.
Now, let's find out how many coins of the first type Becky gave to exchange for coins of the second type:
8 coins × price = 97 coins
So, the price at which Becky exchanged each coin of the first type was 97 / 8 = Rs 12.1.
Now, we can find out how much money Becky made from selling her coins of the first type:
Money made = Number of coins sold × Price per coin
= 14 coins × Rs 12.1
= Rs 165.4
Therefore, Becky made Rs 165.4 from selling her coins of the first type.
Now, let's find out how many coins of the second type Becky got in return for the coins of the first type she sold:
Number of coins received = Money made / Price per coin
= Rs 165.4 / Rs 12.1
= 13.7 coins
Therefore, Becky received 13.7 coins of the second type in return for the coins of the first type she sold."
"Response: 
Becky has 43 coins and exchanged them for 114 tokens. If she had 154 coins and exchanged them for 78 tokens, then how many more coins did Becky exchange for tokens than she initially had?
Let X be the number of coins that Becky initially had. Then we know that:
X + 43 = 154 (coins)
X + 114 = 268 (tokens)
Now, let Y be the number of coins that Becky exchanged for tokens. We can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:
Y + 43 = 78
Subtracting 43 from both sides gives us:
Y = 35
So, Becky exchanged 35 coins for tokens. Therefore, the answer is 35."
"Response:  The given information is:
Keli has 22 tennis balls in his bag. Each tennis ball weighs 0.14 kg. So, Keli's bag weighs 22 x 0.14 = 3.08 kg. Now, there are 140 games in total. Since each game requires 3.08 kg of weight, the number of games that can be carried in Keli's bag is 3.08 / 0.14 = 22.14 games. Therefore, Keli can carry 22 games in his bag."
Response:  If Kelir has 106 games and he gives away 64 of them, then he will have 42 games left with him.
Response:  If she had 91 games in her bag and now has 92 games, then she must have added at least one more game to her collection. So, the number of games she had before adding the new one is 91 - 92 = -1. Therefore, she had 90 games in her bag before adding the new one.
"Response: 
The number of non-tendon games is 20.
So, the total number of games = Number of non-tendon games + Number of tendon games.
= 20 + 70
= 90
Therefore, there are 90 games in total."
"Response: 
Keli has 46 tennis balls and 132 soccer balls. To find out how many soccer balls Keli can have if he already has 31 soccer balls, we need to subtract the number of soccer balls he already has from the total number of soccer balls he has.
So, Keli can have at most 101 soccer balls (132 - 31 = 101)."
Response:  The total number of games is 80. Kelir has 31 games and he gave 31 to his friends. So, the remaining games are 59 (80 - 31). Now, we need to find out how many games each friend got from Kelir. Since there are 7 friends in total, each friend will get 8 games (59 / 7 = 8). Therefore, all 7 friends have 8 games each.
Response:  The number of blocks that Ryan has is 52 and he uses them to make one tower. If there are 38 remaining blocks, then how many blocks did Ryan use to make the tower?
Response:  The total number of blocks is 97. If they can use 32 blocks to make one tower, then how many towers can they make with the remaining 65 blocks? So, the answer is 65/32 = 2 towers.
"Response: 
Ryan has 79 blocks and he used 14 of them to build a tower. So, Ryan has 65 blocks left (79 - 14 = 65).
Now, he gave 11 blocks to his friend Bob. So, Ryan has 54 blocks left (65 - 11 = 54)."
"Response: 
Ryan has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build one tower. So, Ryan has 31 blocks left.
Now, he uses 53 blocks to build another tower. So, Ryan has 0 blocks left.
Therefore, Ryan used a total of 27 + 53 = 80 blocks."
"Response: 
Ryan has 37 blocks and wants to make two towers with different heights. To build one tower, he needs 33 blocks, and for another tower, he needs 13 blocks. So, in total, Ryan uses 46 blocks (33 + 13) to build both towers."
"Response: 
Ryan has 86 blocks and he uses 79 of them to build one tower. So, he has 8 - 79 = 13 blocks left.
Now, he uses 82 blocks to build another tower. So, he has 13 + 82 = 95 blocks left."
"Response:  If Randi has 36 blocks and he wants to make one tower with 59 blocks, then we need to find out how many blocks will be left after building the tower. So, let's calculate it as follows:
Number of blocks in the tower = Total number of blocks / Number of blocks needed for the tower
= 36 / 59
= 0.61 (or approximately 61%)
So, there will be approximately 61% of the total number of blocks left after building the tower."
"Response: 
Ryan has 95 blocks and wants to share them equally among his friends. So he gives 20 blocks to each of his 5 friends.
Now Ryan has 75 blocks left (95 - 2 x 20 = 75).
To find out how many blocks each friend gets when Ryan shares his remaining blocks equally, we divide the number of blocks he has left by the number of friends he has.
So each friend gets 15 blocks (75 / 5 = 15)."
"Response: 
Ryan has 90 blocks and he uses 89 blocks to build one tower. So, he has 1 block left over.
Now, he builds another tower using 63 blocks. So, he has used a total of 89 + 63 = 152 blocks.
Therefore, Ryan has used 152 - 90 = 62 blocks more than his initial amount (90) while building two towers."
Response:  If there are 20 books in the library and you want to read 5 of them, then you will have to read 5/20 = 1/4 or 25% of the total number of books. So, out of 20 books, you will be able to read 5 books.
"Response: 
If there are 13 books in the first set and you have read 8 of them, then there are 5 remaining books that you haven't read yet (13 - 8 = 5).
Now, if there are 8 more books in the second set, then the total number of books you haven't read is equal to the number of books in the second set minus the number of books you have read from both sets (8 + 5 = 13).
So, in the ""Krezig Sil School"" series, there are 13 books that you haven't read."
"Response: 

From the given options, we have to choose two books and five movies from the list of 22 books and 10 movies. So, the total number of choices will be:

The first seven doctors have used 7 ticks each. If two more doctors join them, then there will be a total of 9 doctors (including the original 7). So, each doctor will use 9/7 = 1.2 tickets on average."
Response:  The first student had 12 tickets and used them all to buy some snacks. If there were originally 14 tickets in total, then the second student must have had 2 more tickets than the first student (14 - 12 = 2). So, the second student had 14 tickets in total.
"Response: 
If they had 18 ticks and divided them equally among 5 tasks, each task would have received 3.6 ticks (18/5).
Now, if they used 3.6 ticks for some other work and had 11 ticks left, and then divided those 11 ticks equally among 3 tasks, each task would receive 3.67 ticks (11/3).
So, the number of ticks that Dev will have after completing all the tasks is: 3.6 + 3.67 = 7.27 ticks."
"Response: 
If they had 19 tickets and used 12 of them to watch movies, then they have 7 remaining tickets.

So, there are 5 bags of rice left (14 - 9 = 5)."
"Response: 
Heilie had 13 bags of rice. After one bag was taken away, he had 6 bags left. So, initially, Heilie had 13 - 1 = 12 bags of rice.
Now, after one more bag was taken away, he had 12 - 1 = 11 bags of rice.
Therefore, the number of bags of rice that were left after two bags were taken away is 11."
"Response:  We know that Heidi had 20 apples in her basket before she gave one to Tom. After giving an apple to Tom, she has 19 apples left. Now, we are told that four more apples were added to her basket after Tom took one. So, the total number of apples Heidi now has is:

19 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the answer is 23 apples."
Response:  We know that 5 goats were killed after one of them died. So, there are now 4 goats left. If we have 12 goats in total, then 8 goats must be alive (since 12 - 5 = 7). Therefore, Heidi has 8 goats with her.
"Response: 
He had 9 goats initially. After one of them died, he had 4 left. Now, he has 5 more goats, so he has a total of 9 + 4 = 13 goats now."
Response:  We know that 2 heaps of rice were given to each of the two friends. So, in total, 4 heaps of rice were given (2 x 2 = 4). Now, we are asked how many heaps of rice will be left if 12 heaps of rice were distributed among them in proportionate shares. To find out, we need to divide 12 by 4, which gives us 3 heaps of rice per friend (12 / 4 = 3). Therefore, there will be 6 heaps of rice left (6 = 3 + 3).
"Response:  If there are 13 trees in the forest and each tree has 5 branches, then the total number of branches in the forest is:

Response:  If they take 66 sacks of rice every day and there are 30 days in a month, then they will have taken 2080 sacks of rice (66 x 30 = 2080) in that month.
"Response: 
Tina takes 8 sacks of rice every day.
To find out how many days it will take to fill 24 sacks, we need to divide the number of sacks Tina can carry in one day (8) by the number of days she has to fill 24 sacks (24 / 8 = 3).
So, it will take Tina 3 days to fill 24 sacks of rice."
Response:  The number of days is given as 4 and the total number of observations is 56. So, if each observer observes for 4 days, then the total number of observations in one day will be 56 / 4 = 14 observations per day.
"Response: 
Day 1 to Day 38 = 38 days x 38 sacks per day = 1492 sacks (approximately)
Total number of sacks after 49 days = Total number of sacks after 38 days + Number of sacks in additional 11 days = 1492 + 11 x 38 = 1602 sacks (approximately)"
"Response: 
Day 1 to day 87 = 87 days
Each day they consume 66 sacks of rice = 87 x 66 = 5902 sacks of rice
So, after 87 days, they will have consumed 5902 x 87 = 493,554 sacks of rice."
"Response: 
Day 1: They took 8 sacks of rice. So they have taken 8 x 35 = 280 kg of rice in total.
Day 2: They took 7 sacks of rice. So they have taken 7 x 35 = 245 kg of rice in total.
Day 3: They took 6 sacks of rice. So they have taken 6 x 35 = 210 kg of rice in total.
And so on...
Therefore, the total number of kilograms of rice they took each day is: 280 + 245 + 210 +... = 1950 kg."
"Response: 
Day 1: 16 sacks of rice = 16 x 57 kg = 904 kg
So, in 80 days, they will have collected 80 x 904 kg = 72320 kg of rice."
"Response: 

Day 1: 67 sacks of rice are transported, and each sack weighs 50 kg. Therefore, total weight = 67 x 50 = 3350 kg.

Day 2-35: Each day, 12 kg of rice is cooked, which means that in total, 12 x 35 = 420 kg of rice is cooked during these days.

Total weight of rice transported + Total weight of rice cooked = 3350 + 420 = 3770 kg.

Therefore, 3770 kg of rice were transported and cooked altogether."
"Response: 
Day 1 to Day 74 = 73 days (as per the given information)
Total number of sacks collected in 73 days = 74 x 73 = 5269 sacks
So, after 51 days (i.e., from day 51 to day 74), they have collected 5269 / 51 = 101 sacks per day."
"Response: 
Day 1: They take 76 sacks of rice (76 x 50 = 3800 kg) and give away 64 bags (64 x 50 = 3200 kg). So they have 1600 kg left.
Day 2: They take 76 sacks of rice again (76 x 50 = 3800 kg), but now they have to give away 64 bags again (64 x 50 = 3200 kg). So they have 1600 kg left again.
Repeating this process for all days, if they take 76 sacks of rice per day and give away 64 bags per day, then after 7 days they will have 0 kg left."
"Response: 
Day 1 to Day 28 = 28 days (as given in the question)
Total amount of rice cooked = 28 x 30 = 840 grams (as given in the question)
Remaining rice after 28 days = Total amount of rice cooked - Amount of rice consumed per day = 840 grams - 52 grams/day = 788 grams
Therefore, after 28 days, they will have 788 grams of remaining rice."
"Response: 
Day 1 to day 82 = 82 days (Tina takes 82 days to complete her work)
Day 83 to day 90 = 8 days (Tina takes 8 days more to complete her work)
Total number of days Tina will take to complete her work = 82 + 8 = 90 days."
"Response: 
Day 1 to day 31 = 30 days (as per the given information)
Total number of opaka komla = 24 + 31 = 55
So, after 45 days, there will be 55 - 45 = 10 opaka komlas left."
"Response: 
Day 1: 44 + 25 = 69 (pakora and opaka)
Day 2: 69 - 25 = 44 (only pakora)
Day 3: 44 + 25 = 69 (again, both pakora and opaka)
And so on...
Therefore, the number of days it takes to sell all the pakoras and opakoras is 69."
"Response: 
Day 1: 5 opakas + 74 opakas = 89 opakas
Day 2: 5 opakas + 74 opakas = 89 opakas (no change)
Day 3: 5 opakas + 74 opakas = 89 opakas (no change)
...
So, in total, 5 opakas and 74 opakas are equal to 89 opakas. Therefore, the number of opakas that are more than 5 is 0."
"Response: 
If they take 54 days to collect 30 tins of comla, and they collect 18 tins per day, then how many days will it take them to collect all 30 tins?
So, the answer is 54 / 18 = 3 days."
"Response: 
According to the question, Tarini and her friends have collected 56 sacks of rice in total.
To find out how many days it took them to collect that much rice, we need to divide the number of sacks by the number of days they had (14 days).
So, the number of sacks collected per day is:
56 / 14 = 4
Therefore, Tarini and her friends collected 4 sacks of rice per day."
"Response: 
Day 1 to day 25 = 24 days (as per the given information)
Each day they consume 25 opari prakriti kumla and 5 paripakva kumla, so in total for 24 days:
Opari prakriti kumla = 25 x 24 = 600
Paripakva kumla = 5 x 24 = 120
So, after 24 days, their total stock of kumla will be:
Total kumla = 600 + 120 = 720
Therefore, there will be 720 pieces of kumla left after 24 days."
"Response: 
Day 1: They drank 65 ml of water and spilled 46 ml. So they had 19 ml left.
Day 2: They drank 65 ml again and spilled 46 ml, so they had 19 ml left.
... (repeating this process for each day)...
Day 7: They drank 65 ml and spilled 46 ml, so they had 0 ml left.
Therefore, after 7 days, they will have consumed 490 ml (65 x 7) of water and spilled 318 ml (46 x 7)."
"Response: 
Day 1: 41 opari prakash comla + 86 pari prakash comla = Total of 127 comlas (opari and pari) in one day.
Now, we need to find out how many more or less than 127 comlas are there in each subsequent day.
So, for Day 2, we have: 41 opari prakash comla - 86 pari prakash comla = 45 comlas.
For Day 3, we have: 45 comlas - 86 pari prakash comla = 41 comlas.
And so on...
Therefore, the total number of comlas in all days is: 127 + 45 + 41 +... = Total of 298 comlas."
"Response: 
Day 1: 71 opari paka comala + 60 paaka comala = 131 total comala.
Day 2: 71 opari paka comala - 60 paaka comala = 11 comala.
So, in total, 131 + 11 = 142 comalas are needed to fill up the basket."
"Response: 

Firstly, we have to find out how many fruits are there in Jessi's basket. According to the question, there are 12 fruits in total. So, the number of fruits in Jessi's basket is 12.

Now, let's count the number of apples and oranges in Jessi's basket. According to the question, there are 11 fruits in Jessi's basket, including 5 apples and 6 oranges. Therefore, the number of apples in Jessi's basket is 5, and the number of oranges is 6."
"Response: 
The cost of Jessi's car is $7000. If she needs to buy another car worth $14000 for her business purpose, what will be the total cost of both cars?
Total Cost = Cost of First Car + Cost of Second Car
= $7000 + $14000
= $21000
Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $21000."
"Response: 
The length of Jessi's hair is 7 feet. If she wants to cut it into 14 bangs, how long will each bang be?
So, we need to divide the total length of her hair (7 feet) by 14 (the number of bangs).
$ \frac{7}{14} = 0.5 $
Therefore, each bang will be $ 0.5 $ foot long."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Jesir has 11 fruits in total and he wants to distribute them equally among his friends. So, if he gives each friend an equal number of fruits, then the number of fruits each friend will get is:
Number of fruits = Total number of fruits / Number of friends
= 11 / 5 (friends)
= 2.2 (approximately)
Now, let's consider the case where Jesir has 15 fruit packets in total and he wants to distribute them equally among his 5 friends. In this case, the number of fruit packets each friend will get can be calculated as follows:
Number of fruit packets = Total number of fruit packets / Number of friends
= 15 / 5
= 3 (approximately)
So, in both cases, the approximate number of fruit packets or pieces that Jesir will give to each of his 5 friends is around 2-3."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Jesir Kakshi has 2 feet and 12 fingers. So, the total number of digits (fingers + toes) is 2 + 12 = 14.

Now, if each tail has 4 bars, then the total number of bars in all tails together is 4 x 14 = 56 bars."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that there are 19 fruits in Jessi's basket and 18 fruits in Pinky's basket. So, if we add both baskets together, we get:

19 + 18 = 37

Now, let's assume that all of these fruits are apples. If so, then the total number of apples in both baskets is:

37 x 1 = 37

So, the answer to the question is 37."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Jesir Kakshi has 19 feet in length and 20 feet in width.

Now, to find out how many times wider than long, we need to divide the width (20) by the length (19). So, the ratio of width to length is 20/19 = 1.052631578947368.

Since this is not a whole number, we can round it off to the nearest integer value which is 1.05. Therefore, Jesir Kakshi is approximately 1.05 times wider than longer."
Response:  The carpet has 10 burgers and each burger is of size 5 feet long. So, the total length of the carpet = Number of burgers x Size of each burger. Therefore, the total length of the carpet = 10 x 5 = 50 feet.
Response:  The carpet has 10 burgers and each burger requires 2 feet of space. So, the total area required for all 10 burgers is 10 x 2 = 20 feet.
"Response: 
The total number of carpets = 18 x 4 = 72
Since there are 30 feet in a yard, we can convert the length of each carpet as follows:
Length of each carpet = 72 / 30 = 2.4 yards (or 2.4 x 3 = 6.9 feet)
Now, let's calculate the total area of all the carpets:
Area of each carpet = Length x Width = 2.4 x 6.9 = 15.9 square feet
So, the total area of all the carpets is 15.9 square feet."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Rajib and Arkan have sold 23 t-shirts each at $15 per piece, which means they have earned a total of $325 (23 x $15 = $325).

Now, let's calculate how many t-shirts each of them has sold. To do this, we need to divide the amount they have earned by the price of one t-shirt. So, for Rajib, we can calculate as follows:

$325 / $15 = 21

So, Rajib has sold 21 t-shirts. Similarly, for Arkan, we can calculate as follows:

$325 / $15 = 21

Arkan has also sold 21 t-shirts. Therefore, both Rajib and Arkan have sold 21 t-shirts each."
"Response:  The total amount of money spent is $51 dollars and there are 3 t-shirts in each pack. So, the cost per t-shirt would be:
Cost per t-shirt = Total amount of money spent / Number of t-shirts in a pack
= $51 / 3
= $17 per t-shirt"
"Response: 

1. Raju bought 87 t-shirts and sold each one for $95. So, he earned $87 x 95 = $8355 from selling t-shirts.
2. Arkansaas game and Textile traded 48 t-shirts and earned $48 x 95 = $4670 from selling t-shirts.
3. Now, let's find out how much money Arkansaas game earned from selling t-shirts after buying them from Raju. Since Arkansaas game bought 48 t-shirts from Raju, it means they paid $48 x 95 = $4670 to Raju. Therefore, their profit from selling those t-shirts is $4670 - $4670 = $0. They didn't earn any money from selling t-shirts."
"Response: 
Rajib bought 106 t-shirts and sold each one for $10. So he earned $1060 from selling those t-shirts.
Arkansas Game bought 242 t-shirts and sold each one for $20. So they earned $4840 from selling those t-shirts.
Now we need to find out how many t-shirts Arkansas Game would have sold if Rajib had sold his t-shirts at the same price as Arkansas Game did.
So, let's divide the amount of money that Arkansas Game earned ($4840) by the price they sold their t-shirts for ($20):
$4840 ÷ $20 = 242 t-shirts
Therefore, Arkansas Game would have sold 242 t-shirts if Rajib had sold his t-shirts at the same price as Arkansas Game did."
"Response: 

1. The revenue of each ticket sold is $98.
2. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission sells 163 tickets.
3. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department sells 89 tickets.
4. Therefore, the total revenue from both departments is:
$98 x 163 = $15,704
$98 x 89 = $8,772
Total Revenue = $15,704 + $8,772 = $24,476
Therefore, the answer is $24,476."
"Response: 
Rajib bought 78 t-shirts at $4 each and sold them for $186 in total.
Arkansas Game sold 172 t-shirts at $5 each and earned $860 in total.
So, Arkansas Game earned more money than Rajib.
The difference between the amount of money earned by Arkansas Game and Rajib is:
$860 - $186 = $674
Therefore, Arkansas Game earned $674 more than Rajib."
"Response: 

Rajib buys 62 t-shirts and each costs $10. So, he spends $620 on t-shirts.
He also buys 99 jerseys and each costs $50. So, he spends $4950 on jerseys.
In total, Rajib spends $620 + $4950 = $5570."
"Response: 
Rajib bought 67 t-shirts and each cost $20. So he spent a total of $1340 ($67 x $20).
Arkanas bought 74 t-shirts and each cost $16. So he spent a total of $1208 ($74 x $16).
Jarvis bought 156 t-shirts and each cost $19. So he spent a total of $2944 ($156 x $19).
Now, let's find out how much money Jarvis saved by buying in bulk. He bought 156 t-shirts for $2944, which means he paid an average price of $19 per t-shirt. Rajib bought 67 t-shirts for $1340, which means he paid an average price of $20 per t-shirt. Arkanas bought 74 t-shirts for $1208, which means he paid an average price of $16 per t-shirt.
So, Jarvis saved $736 ($2944 - $2208) by buying in bulk."
"Response: 

Rajib bought 192 t-shirts and 34 jerseys for $157 each. So, in total, he spent:

T-shirts = 192 x $157 = $28,604
Jerseys = 34 x $157 = $5,288
Total cost = T-shirt cost + Jersey cost
= $28,604 + $5,288
= $33,892

So, Rajib spent $33,892 to buy 192 t-shirts and 34 jerseys."
"Response: 

Rajib bought 86 t-shirts and 232 jeans in one shot. So, he spent $86 x 86 = $7,192 on t-shirts and $232 x 232 = $53,048 on jeans.

Now, let's calculate how much Rajib spent on each item per unit:

T-shirt cost per unit = Total cost / Number of t-shirts = $7,192 / 86 = $85 per t-shirt
Jeans cost per unit = Total cost / Number of jeans = $53,048 / 232 = $230 per jean

So, Rajib spent $85 per t-shirt and $230 per jean."
"Response: 

Step 1: The total number of shares that Rajib and Arnab together own is 51 shares.

Step 2: Each share costs $100, so the total value of their combined holdings is $5,100 ($51 x $100).

Step 3: They sell 8 shares each at $130 per share, resulting in a total sale price of $1,040 ($8 x $130) for Rajib and $960 ($8 x $110) for Arnab.

Step 4: After selling their shares, they have $4,060 left ($5,100 - $1,040 - $960).

Therefore, the amount of money they will get after selling their shares is $4,060."
"Response: 

1. The revenue of each ticket is $2017.
2. Arkansas and Texas taxes are $317 per ticket.
3. So, the total cost of each ticket after taxes is $1798 ($2017 - $317).
4. If they sell 14 tickets, their total revenue will be $25,768 (14 x $1798).

Therefore, the answer is $25,768."
Response:  The total amount of money that Arkanas and Texa can earn in one hour is $60 per dollar = 60 x 100 = $6000. If they work for 8 hours a day, then their daily income will be $6000 x 8 = $48,000. Now, if they work for 30 days in a month, their monthly income will be $48,000 x 30 = $1,440,000.
Response:  The total amount of money spent is $215 and there are 5 t-shirts. So, we can calculate the cost per t-shirt as follows: Cost per t-shirt = Total amount / Number of t-shirts = $215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt.
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Rajib spent in each shop:

Rajib spent 5 dollars per jar of jam and bought 20 jars, so he spent a total of $100 (5 x 20 = 100).

He also spent 215 dollars for each tube of shampoo and bought 64 tubes, so he spent a total of $13,300 (215 x 64 = 13,300).

Therefore, the total amount of money that Rajib spent is $13,400 ($100 + $13,300)."
"Response: 

Rajib bought 76 dollar worth of goods from each of the 3 shops at $20 per item. So he spent a total of:

$$ 76 x 3 = 228 $$

Now, let's calculate how much Arkana and Texa made selling their items.
Arkana sold 158 items at $20 each, so she earned:

$$ 158 \times 20 = 3160 $$

Texa sold 2 items at $10 each, so he earned:

$$ 2 \times 10 = 20 $$

So, in total, Arkana and Texa made:

$$ 3160 + 20 = 3180 $$

Finally, Rajib paid them $204 for the goods they provided him. So, the amount left with Arkana and Texa is:

$$ 3180 - 204 = 3076 $$"
"Response: 

Rajib has 210 dollars in his wallet and spends 240 dollars every week. So he will have $860 after 4 weeks (210 + 240 x 4 = 860).

Arkanas has 177 dollars in her purse and spends 23 dollars every day. So she will have $591 after 1 month (177 + 23 x 30 = 591).

Now let's find out how much money Rajib can lend Arkanas. Since Rajib has $860 and wants to lend $591 to Arkanas, we need to subtract the amount he wants to lend from the total amount of money he has: $860 - $591 = $269.

So Rajib can lend Arkanas $269."
"Response: 

The refrigerator holds 115 dollars worth of food and drinks per jar, and each jar contains 25 dollars worth of lava cake. Therefore, the total value of all jars is $115 x 4 = $460.

Now, let's calculate how much Arkansas and Texas have contributed to the game. Since they have contributed equally, we can divide their contributions by two. So, Arkansas has contributed $113 / 2 = $56.50, and Texas has contributed $78 / 2 = $39.

Finally, let's find out how much money one jar of lava cake costs. We know that there are 4 jars in total, so if one jar costs $25, then the cost of one jar is $25 / 4 = $6.25."

"Response: 
Harvest Mouse spends $403 per week.
He has 233 weeks of harvesting.
So, he will spend $49 x 233 = $10,757 in total."
"Response: 
Harvest time is 1359 weeks. If they can produce $388 per week during harvest season, then their total revenue for 1359 weeks will be:
$388 x 1359 = $507,420
Now, if they spent $368 per week during non-harvest seasons, their total expenses for 1359 weeks will be:
$368 x 1359 = $507,420
So, their profit for 1359 weeks will be:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
= $507,420 - $507,420
= $0
Therefore, the farmer did not make any profit over the given period of 1359 weeks."

So, the person earned $2,507 during their 19-week harvest season."
Response:  If he spends $2 per week, then in one month (4 weeks), he will spend $8. So, if he spends $178 in total, it means he spent $178 / $8 = 22.5 months. Therefore, Harvest has been spending money for 22.5 months.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the volume of water in the tank is 10 gallons (as mentioned in the question).

Now, let's calculate the volume of water that will come out when the tap is opened. We can do this by multiplying the number of faucets (9) with the flow rate of each faucet (1 gallon per minute). So, the total volume of water coming out from all 9 faucets will be:

9 x 1 gallon/minute = 9 gallons/minute

Since the time taken to fill the tank is 5 minutes, the total volume of water filled into the tank during this time will be:

9 gallons/minute x 5 minutes = 45 gallons

So, the final volume of water left in the tank after filling it for 5 minutes will be:

10 gallons - 45 gallons = 35 gallons

Therefore, the remaining water in the tank after filling it for 5 minutes is 35 gallons."
"Response:  We know that after Brahma created the universe, he created fourteen worlds in it. Now, let's calculate how much water was present in each of these worlds based on the information given in the passage.
According to the passage, one diner (a unit of measurement) is equal to eight fots (a smaller unit of measurement). So, if we convert 14 diners into fots, we get:

14 diners x 8 fots/diner = 112 fots
Now, we are told that the depth of the ocean at this point in time was equal to Dinar's height multiplied by eight. Based on the information provided earlier, Dinar's height is 3600 feet or 1097 meters. Therefore, the depth of the ocean at this point in time would be:

112 fots x 1097 meters/fot = 1215440 meters
So, the depth of the ocean at the time when Brahma created the universe was approximately 1215440 meters."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that:

* The speed of water is 5 feet per gallon (gallons per second).
* The depth of the well is 11 feet.
* The diameter of the pipe is 4 feet.

Now, let's calculate the volume of water in the well:
Volume of water = Depth of well x Cross-sectional area of pipe
= 11 ft x π(4 ft)^2
= approximately 360 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert this volume from cubic feet to gallons:
Gallons = Cubic feet / Gallons per foot
= 360 cu ft / 5 ft/gal
= approximately 72 gallons

So, if the water level drops 12 feet, the new volume of water in the well will be:
New volume of water = Old volume of water - Volume lost due to evaporation
= 72 gal - (Depth of well x 0.05)
= approximately 69 gallons

Therefore, the water level dropped 3 feet."
Response:  We know that after Brahma created the universe, he created fourteen rounds of creation (or ages). In each round, there are 720,000 years. So in total, Brahma created for 984,000,000 years. Now, we need to find out how much water was present during the last round of creation. According to the question, the density of water is 1 g/cm^3 and its volume is 15 cubic meters per liter. Since the last round of creation had 4 feet of water, we can calculate the volume of water as follows: Volume of water = Number of liters x Density of water x Height of water = 15 m^3/L x 1 g/cm^3 x 4 ft = 60 cubic meters. Therefore, the amount of water present during the last round of creation was 60 cubic meters.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the diameter of Brahma is 16 Gunas (units).
Next, we are told that the density of water is 1 g/cm^3.
Now, let's calculate the volume of Brahma using the formula: Volume = Diameter x Circumference.
The circumference of a circle is given by the formula: Circumference = 2 x Pi x Diameter.
So, substituting the values, we get:
Volume of Brahma = 16 x (2 x Pi) = 4000 cubic Gunas.
Finally, to convert this value to liters, we need to divide it by the density of water in kg/m^3. Since the density of water is 1 g/cm^3, we can multiply the result by 1000 (since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter) to get the final answer:
Brahma's volume in liters = 4000 / 1 = 4000 liters."
Response:  We know that the volume of water in the jar is equal to the product of its height and diameter. So, if we assume that the height of the jar is x cm, then the volume of water in it will be x x pi (π) x radius^2 cubic centimeters. Now, we are given that the radius of the jar is half of the distance between two parallel lines that are 15 feet apart, which means that the radius of the jar is 7.5 feet. Therefore, the volume of water in the jar is: x x pi (π) x (7.5)^2 = 345.08 cubic centimeters.
Response:  If Brain can read two books simultaneously with each book containing 32 pages, then he can read 34 books in total (2 x 32 = 64 pages).
Response:  Brain has 42 books in his library and each bookshelf can hold 2 books. So, how many bookshelves does he have? We need to divide 42 by 2 to find out. Therefore, Brain has 21 bookshelves.
"Response: 

Braian has 23 books and 80 magazines. If he gives away 27 of his books and 25 of his magazines, how many does he have left?

Let's first calculate Braian's original number of books:

23 x 2 = 46 (books)

Now let's calculate Braian's original number of magazines:

80 - 25 = 55 (magazines)

So, Braian had 46 books and 55 magazines originally."
"Response: 

10 books x $25 = $250 (Total cost of all 10 books)
46 magazines x $10 = $460 (Total cost of all 46 magazines)

So, the total amount Brain paid is $250 + $460 = $710."
"Response: 

Braian has 29 books and 61 magazines. If he gives away 23 books and 37 magazines, then how many books and magazines will Braian have left?

Books: 29 - 23 = 6
Magazines: 61 - 37 = 24

So, Braian will have 6 books and 24 magazines left."
Response:  We know that Brain has 7 books in his bag and each book contains one word. So, if he has 28 books in total, then there are 28 x 1 = 28 words in all of his books combined.
"Response: 

Braian has read 2 books in each of the last 38 years. So, he has read a total of 2 x 38 = 76 books so far.

If Braian continues to read at this rate for another 38 years, he will have read a total of 76 + (2 x 38) = 140 books."
Response:  If there are 10 friends of Carol and each friend brings 2 presents, then in total, Carol will receive 2 x 10 = 20 gifts. So, none of her friends will bring bad luck to Carol.
Response:  We are given that there are 12 friends and each friend has brought one gift for the birthday party. So, in total, we have 12 gifts. Now, let's assume that each gift is of equal weight (i.e., no heavier or lighter than any other). Therefore, the total weight of all 12 gifts will be the same. Since we are asked to find out how many kilograms these gifts weigh, we can conclude that each gift weighs 1 kg.
"Response: 
Carol has two friends, A and B. Each friend has a birthday every year, so there are 2 birthdays in total. Now, let's consider how many candles Carol will light for each of her friends based on the information given in the question:
For Friend A, Carol lights 3 candles per package, and she buys 5 packages. So, Carol lights 15 candles (3 x 5 = 15) for Friend A.
For Friend B, Carol also lights 3 candles per package, but she buys only 4 packages this time. Therefore, Carol lights 12 candles (3 x 4 = 12) for Friend B.
So, in total, Carol lights 27 candles (15 + 12 = 27) for both of her friends combined."
"Response: 
Carol has 3 friends - A, B, and C. Each friend of Carol has a different number of birthdays in a year -
* A has 4 birthdays in a year.
* B has 5 birthdays in a year.
* C has 6 birthdays in a year.
Now, let's calculate how many birthdays Carol will have if she invites each of her friends to her party every year -
* If Carol invites A to her party, then A will give 4 birthday wishes to Carol.
* If Carol invites B to her party, then B will give 5 birthday wishes to Carol.
* If Carol invites C to her party, then C will give 6 birthday wishes to Carol.
So, in total, Carol will receive 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 birthday wishes from her friends every year."
"Response: 
Carol has three friends - A, B, and C. Each friend has two pets - Dog and Cat. So, in total, Carol has 3 x 2 = 6 pets."
Response:  Melisa scored 12 points in each of her first 4 attempts. If she scores more than 36 points overall, then she must have attempted at least 5 times (since 12 x 5 = 60). So, she must have attempted 5 or 6 times.
"Response: 
Melisa has scored 81 points in total.
Each game she played had one unique score.
So, there are 3 games in total.
Now, we need to find out how many points Melisa scored in each game.
Let's assume that the number of points Melisa scored in each game is x.
We know that the sum of all three scores is equal to 81. So, we can write an equation:
x + x + x = 81
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x = 81
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 27
Therefore, Melisa scored 27 points in each game."
"Response: 
Melisa scored 109 points in one quiz and 82 points in another quiz. So, her total score is:
109 + 82 = 191 points.
Therefore, Melisa scored 191 points in 79 questions."
"Response:  If Melisa can score 21 points in one game, and she scores 7 points per quarter, then she will play for how many quarters to reach 21 points?
Quarter duration = 15 minutes (approximately)
So, Melisa needs to play for:
21 / 7 = 3 quarters
Therefore, Melisa will play for 3 quarters to reach 21 points."
Response:  Melisa has scored 91 points in total and there are 13 questions in each section. So, she got 91/13 = 7 points for each question.

"Response: 

1. The park has 90 people per hour.
2. In one time slot (say, 3 hours), there are 18 people who can attend the ferry ride at once.

So, the number of times the ferry can carry passengers in an hour is:

Number of times = Total capacity / Number of people who can attend in one time slot
= 90 / 18
= 5

Therefore, the ferry can carry 5 times in an hour."
"Response: 
The park has 19 trees and each tree bears 15 fruits per year. So, in total, there are 19 x 15 = 285 fruits produced by all the trees in the park every year.
Now, let's find out how many people can eat these fruits at once. Since there are 30 people who come to the park every day, we need to divide the total number of fruits by 30 to know how many fruits each person can eat at once.
So, 285 fruits / 30 people = 9 fruits per person per day."
"Response: 
The park has 18 turns and each turn has 15 people walking through it. So, in total, there are 18 x 15 = 270 people who walk through the park every day."
Response:  The park has 6 sections and each section can accommodate 14 people. So, in total, it can accommodate 6 x 14 = 84 people. Now, there are already 16 people in the park, so we have reached our capacity. Therefore, no more people can enter the park.
"Response: 

For small asans (20), we need to calculate how many people can fit in each one. Since there are 14 days in a week and each day has 8 hours of work, we have:

Number of people who can fit in a small asan = Number of working hours / Working time per person
= 14 x 8 / 1
= 112 people

Now, let's move on to big asans (33). We again need to calculate how many people can fit in each one:

Number of people who can fit in a big asan = Number of working hours / Working time per person
= 26 x 8 / 1
= 210 people

So, in total, 112 + 210 = 322 people can fit in both small and big asans combined."
"Response: 
For small asans (3), we need to multiply 16 x 3 = 48 people.
For big asans (7), we need to multiply 12 x 7 = 84 people.
So, in total, there will be 48 + 84 = 132 people who can sit in the park."

Response:  The mother had 45 flowers and gave one to each of her four children. So, she gave away 45 x 4 = 180 flowers in total. If there are 45 flowers left after giving them all away, then the number of flowers that each child received is 180 / 4 = 45.
"Response: 
The mother has 9 flowers and gives 45 beads to each of her 3 children. So, she gave a total of 9 x 3 = 27 flowers to her children.
Now, let's assume that each flower has 10 beads (which is not mentioned in the question). Then, the total number of beads given by the mother would be 27 x 10 = 270 beads."
"Response: 
The mother has 36 flowers and she wants to give one flower each to her three children. So, she will have 36 - 3 = 33 flowers left after giving them to her children.
Now, there are 12 petals in each flower, so the total number of petals she will have is 33 x 12 = 408 petals."
"Response: 
The mother has 55 flowers and she wants to give one flower each to her 5 children. So, she will have 55 - 5 = 50 flowers left after giving one flower to each of her 5 children.
Now, there are 35 flowers in each pot, so if she gives one flower from each pot to each of her 5 children, then she will have 35 x 5 = 175 flowers left in total.
So, the final answer is 50 + 175 = 225 flowers."
"Response:  The mother planted 5 flowers in each pot and there were 20 pots in total. So, the number of flowers planted by the mother is:

5 x 20 = 100 flowers

Now, let's assume that the children planted 60 more flowers. So, the total number of flowers planted by both the mother and the children is:

100 + 60 = 160 flowers"
"Response: 
The mother has 8 flowers in her hand and she wants to give each of her 4 children 32 flowers in total. So, she will have to distribute 8 flowers among 4 children, which means each child will get 2 flowers (since there are 8 flowers in total)."

"Response: 
Mythu had 15 biscuits and he distributed them equally among his 5 friends. So each friend got 3 biscuits (15/5 = 3).
Now, Mythu gave 10 more biscuits to his other 4 friends. So now there are 25 biscuits in total (3 + 10 = 13).
So, each of Mythu's 9 friends (including him) has 2.77 biscuits on average (25/9 = 2.77)."
"Response: 
Mythu had 24 friends and gave each of them an equal number of crackers (3 each). So, Mythu distributed 72 crackers in total.
Now, if he wants to distribute the remaining 17 crackers among his 3 new friends, he will give 5-6 crackers to each friend (depending on how many he has left)."
"Response: 
Mythu has 22 friends and each friend of Mythu has an equal number of crackers as him. So, if Mythu had 34 crackers, then each of his 11 friends must have had 34/11 = 3 crackers each."
"Response: 
Mythu has 29 friends and each friend of Mythu has an equal number of crackers as him. So, if Mythu had 30 crackers, then each of his friends must have 30/29 = 1.037 crackers (approximately)."
"Response: 
Mythu has 14 friends and each friend of Mythu has an equal number of crackers as Mythu. So, if Mythu had 31 crackers, then each of his 14 friends must have had 21 crackers (since they are equally divided). Therefore, there were 31 + 21 = 52 crackers in total."

Mahesh has 18 friends and each friend of Mahesh has an equal number of cricketers as his/her own friends. So, if there are 36 cricketers in total, then each friend of Mahesh will have 2 cricketers (since 36 / 18 = 2). Therefore, the number of cricketers that each person will have is 2."
"Response: 
Mahesh has 6 friends and each friend gets 36 crackers. So, Mahesh gives away 216 crackers (6 friends x 36 crackers per friend).
Now, if there are 36 people in total, then Mahesh will give away 36 / 6 = 6 crackers to each person. Therefore, he will have 6 - 6 = 0 crackers left for himself."
"Response: 
Mahesh has 23 friends and he gave each of them an equal number of crackers. So, Mahesh distributed 23 x 2 = 46 crackers among his friends.
Now, there are 11 more crackers left with him, which means he has 46 + 11 = 57 crackers in total."
"Response: 
Mythu had 31 biscuits and shared them equally among his 5 friends. So each friend got 6 biscuits (31/5 = 6).
Now, Mythu took back 23 biscuits from his friends. So he has 6 - 23 = -17 biscuits left with him.
Therefore, the number of biscuits that Mythu gave to his friends is 6."

"Response: 
Debi sold 109 pots of paint per day. If she continued to sell that many pots every day for 74 days, how many pots would she have sold in total?
Total number of days = 74 days
Number of pots sold per day = 109 pots/day
Total number of pots sold = Total number of days x Number of pots sold per day
= 74 days x 109 pots/day
= 8,236 pots
Therefore, Debi sold 8,236 pots of paint in total over those 74 days."
Response:  Debi sold 153 pots of paint in total. If she sold one pot per day, then she sold 153/1 = 153 pots in 17 days (since there are 17 days in the given time frame). So, Debi sold 9 pots of paint per day on average.

"Response: 
Debi has 200 liters of water in a container and pours 312 liters into another container every day. So, after one day, Debi will have 512 liters (200 + 312) of water in total.
Now, let's assume that Sodhi takes out 4 liters of water from the same container every day. So, at the end of one day, Sodhi will have taken out 4 liters x 312 = 1248 liters of water.
Therefore, the number of days it will take for Sodhi to empty the container is 1248 / 4 = 312 days."
"Response:  Debi consumes 6 bottles of water per day and she wants to drink at least 12 bottles in total. So, we need to find out how many days it will take her to reach her target.

Total number of bottles = Total consumption per day x Number of days = 6 x (Number of days - 1)

So, the number of days it will take Debi to reach her target is:

(12 - 6) = 6 days

Therefore, Debi will be able to drink 12 bottles of water in 6 days."
"Response: 
Debi has 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of soda. If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 34 bottles of soda every day, how many days will it take for her to finish all of them?
Let's assume that Debi starts with 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of soda.
Water bottles = 95
Soda bottles = 180
Now let's calculate how many bottles Debi consumes per day:
Water consumption per day = 15 (bottles) / 95 (total water bottles) = 0.16 (approximately 1/6th of total water bottles)
Soda consumption per day = 34 (bottles) / 180 (total soda bottles) = 0.19 (approximately 1/5th of total soda bottles)
Now, we need to find out how long it will take for Debi to finish all of these bottles. We can do this by dividing the total number of bottles by the daily consumption rate:
Total bottles = Water bottles + Soda bottles = 95 + 180 = 275
Daily consumption rate = Water consumption + Soda consumption = 0.16 + 0.19 = 0.35 (approximately 1/2nd of total bottles consumed per day)
Time taken to finish all bottles = Total bottles / Daily consumption rate = 275 / 0.35 = approximately 780 days or 2 years and 4 months."
"Response: 
Debi has 360 tins of milk and 162 tins of water. If she consumes 12 tins of milk and 9 tins of water every day, how many days will it take for her to finish them all?

To find out, we need to divide the total number of tins by the daily consumption. So, in this case, we have:
Total tins = 360 + 162 = 522
Daily consumption = 12 + 9 = 21

Now, let's calculate the number of days Debi will take to finish all the tins:
Number of days = Total tins / Daily consumption
= 522 / 21
= 24.8 days

So, Debi will finish all the tins in approximately 24.8 days."

4. Total number of basements required for all schools = Total number of students / Number of basements per school
= 402 / 7 ( since each school needs 7 basements as mentioned in the question)
= 57

Therefore, the number of basements required for all schools is 57."
"Response: 
Number of students in each class = 87 / Number of classes = x
Since there are 58 students in each class, we can write:
Number of students in each class = 58
Now, let's find out how many trips are required to transport all the students from one school to another:
Number of trips required = Total number of students / Number of students per trip = (87 x 58) / 58 = 12
Therefore, there will be 12 trips for transporting all the students from one school to another."

So, there are 1666 pages in all three books combined."
"Response: 

1st day - 2 books (405 pages) = 405 pages read.
2nd day - 2 books (810 pages) = 810 pages read.
3rd day - 2 books (1620 pages) = 1620 pages read.
4th day - 2 books (2430 pages) = 2430 pages read.
5th day - 2 books (3240 pages) = 3240 pages read.
6th day - 2 books (4050 pages) = 4050 pages read.
Total pages read in 6 days = 405 + 810 + 1620 + 2430 + 3240 + 4050 = 19760 pages.
Therefore, Frangoek read 19760 pages in 6 days."

Number of combs in each group = 356
Total number of combs = Number of groups x Number of combs in each group
= 142 x 356
= 49,704
Therefore, there will be 49,704 combs in each group if some of the groups are combined into 48 groups."
"Response: 
The total number of groups is 196.
Each group has at least 392 calendars (since there are more than 392 calendars in Filiper).
So, the total number of calendars in all groups together is:
196 x 392 = 74,508
Therefore, each group has approximately 74,508 calendars."
Response:  We know that there are 180 seats in Filiper's group and each seat has a corresponding person. So, the total number of people in Filiper's group is 180. Now, we need to find out how many groups of 19 people can be formed with these 180 people. To do this, we divide 180 by 19, which gives us 9.5 groups. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 10 groups. Therefore, 10 groups of 19 people can be formed with the 180 people in Filiper's group.
"Response: 

Filipino people have 87 ethnic groups and 290 languages spoken in their country. If two languages are spoken in each group, then there will be 174 groups (87 x 2 = 174). Therefore, each language group has 93 members (174 - 87 = 93)."

"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the distance between two points is equal to the sum of their distances from one point to another. So, if we take any point A and calculate its distance from point B, then we will get the distance between point A and point B.

Now, let's consider the given information:

* The distance between point A (159 km) and point C (628 km) is equal to the sum of their distances from point B (437 km).
* Point B is located at a distance of 437 km from point D.

So, we can write an equation based on these facts:

Distance between A and C = Distance between A and B + Distance between B and D
= 159 km + 437 km
= 596 km

"Response: 

1. The number of people who can be accommodated in a room is 49 grams per person.
2. To calculate the total weight of all the people in the village, we need to multiply the number of people by their individual weight (in grams). So, the total weight of all the people in the village = Number of people x Individual weight (in grams)
3. The total weight of all the people in the village = 5000 x 49 = 245,000 grams
4. Therefore, the total weight of all the people in the village is approximately 245 kilograms or 540 pounds."
"Response: 

1. The person wants to buy a house with an area of 57 square meters in a plot of land measuring 220 square meters.
2. To calculate the cost per meter of the plot of land, we need to divide the total area of the plot (220 square meters) by the number of meters in the length and breadth of the plot (40 meters x 57 meters = 2,380 square meters). So, the cost per meter of the plot is Tk. 960/meter.
3. Now, let's calculate the cost of the entire plot of land based on the price mentioned in the question: Tk. 57 lakh. Divide this amount by the total area of the plot (220 square meters): Tk. 26,868/square meter.
4. Finally, to find out how much the person will have to pay for each meter of the plot, we can multiply the cost per square meter by the number of meters in the length and breadth of the plot: Tk. 26,868 x 2,380 = Tk. 61,63,600.

Therefore, the answer to the question is Tk. 61,63,600."
"Response: 
The distance between two points is given as 166 km. Now, we need to find out how much more or less the second point is from the first point than the distance between them.
So, let's calculate the difference between the two points:
Distance between two points = 166 km
Now, let's subtract the distance between the two points from the total distance traveled:
Total distance traveled = 200 grams - (distance between two points) = 200 grams - 166 km = 34 km
Therefore, the person has traveled an additional 34 kilometers beyond the distance between the two points."
"Response: 
If Tara has 557 grams of rice and needs 17 grams more to make her lunch complete, then we can calculate how many grams of rice she had initially as follows:

Total amount of rice needed = 17 grams + 557 grams = 574 grams

So, Tara had 574 grams of rice initially."
"Response: 

1. The person has Rs 11 in their pocket.
2. They have to buy 492 grams of rice at Rs 35 per gram.
3. To find out how many grams they can buy with Rs 11, we divide the amount of money by the cost price of one gram of rice: Rs 11 / Rs 35 = 0.317 (or approximately 0.32 grams).
4. Since they cannot buy an exact number of grams with the given amount of money, we round off the result to the nearest whole number. In this case, 0.32 grams rounded up to the nearest whole number is 1 gram. So, they can buy 1 gram of rice with Rs 11.

Therefore, the person will have Rs 10 left over after buying 1 gram of rice."
Response:  The total number of days is 6 days and each day they will take 90 dram to complete the work. So, in total, they will need 5400 dram (90 x 6) to finish the job.
Response:  The total number of days is 5 days and each day has 90 dram to be drained. So, in total, 5 x 90 = 450 drams will be drained in 5 days.
Response:  The total number of days is 146 days and the average daily work done by each person is 244 dram per day. So, to find out how many drums of rice will be completed in 146 days, we need to divide the total amount of work (244 x 146 = 35,080) by the number of working days (146). Therefore, 35,080 / 146 = 236.5 drums of rice will be completed in 146 days.
"Response: 

The number of days for which Tarun has been working as a software engineer is given as 77 days.

Tarun has been able to complete 235 tasks in one day, and he works for 10 hours per day. Therefore, the total number of tasks completed by Tarun in 77 days can be calculated as follows:

Total number of tasks = Number of days x Number of tasks per day
= 77 days x 235 tasks/day
= 18,695 tasks

Now, we are also given that Tarun has been able to complete 221 dramas in one day. Since there are 10 hours in a day, each drama takes approximately 22 minutes to complete. Therefore, the total number of dramas completed by Tarun in 77 days can be calculated as follows:

Total number of dramas = Number of days x Number of dramas per day
= 77 days x 221 dramas/day
= 16,477 dramas

So, Tarun has completed a total of 18,695 tasks and 16,477 dramas in his 77-day tenure as a software engineer."

Therefore, none of Apanar's bags contained sugar."
Response:  If one liter of milk is equal to 5 blocks, then for each block, we need 25 ml of milk. So, if there are x blocks in total, then the number of liters of milk required will be 25x. Therefore, the answer is 25x.
"Response:  If one person can make 9 jacks in each block and there are 20 blocks, then the total number of jacks made will be:

9 x 20 = 180 jacks
So, the person can make 180 jacks in total."
Response:  If one block has 6 parts and each part contains 24 jewels, then we can calculate how many jewels are in total as follows: Total number of jewels = Number of blocks x Number of jewels per block = 6 x 24 = 144 jewels. Therefore, there will be 144 jewels in total.
"Response:  If one mealman can make 14 trays of food per block, and each tray requires 2 jacks of milk, then how many blocks will it take to produce 140 trays of food?

Blocks required = Number of trays / Number of jacks per tray
= 140 / 2
= 70 blocks
Therefore, it will take 70 blocks to produce 140 trays of food."
Response:  If one block has 20 bricks and each brick weighs 32 jacks, then the total weight of all blocks will be: Total weight = Number of blocks x Weight per block = 20 x 32 = 640 jacks.
"Response:  If one person can make 30 meals per day and each meal requires 78 blocks of milk, then the total number of blocks required to make all 30 meals is:

30 meals x 78 blocks/meal = 2340 blocks

So, if there are 19 trays of milk, the number of blocks of milk required to make all 30 meals is:

2340 blocks / 19 trays = 126 blocks per tray"
Response:  If one liter of milk is equal to 80 ml, then we have 80 x 32 = 2560 ml in total for all blocks. So, each block has 2560 / 80 = 32 blocks of milk.
"Response:  If we have to give 81 blocks of milk to each person every day, then for how many days will it take to distribute all the milk?

Day 1: Distributed 81 blocks = 81 x 4 = 324 blocks of milk (since there are 4 people in each barrack)

Day 2: Distributed remaining 81 blocks = 81 x 4 = 324 blocks of milk (since there are still 4 people in each barrack)

...

Day n: Distributed remaining 81 blocks = 81 x 4 = 324 blocks of milk (since there are still 4 people in each barrack)

Total number of days required to distribute all the milk = Total number of blocks of milk / Number of blocks distributed per day = 8100 / 324 = 25.67 days

So, it will take approximately 25.67 days to distribute all the milk if we start distributing from today and follow the given pattern."
"Response:  If one liter of milk costs $16 per block and there are 4 blocks in each barrel, then the cost of 1 barrel of milk is:

$16 x 4 = $64

So, if there are 17 barrels in a batch, the total cost of milk in that batch would be:

$64 x 17 = $1058

Therefore, the number of jacks needed to buy all the milk in the batch is:

$1058 / $16 = 66"
"Response: 
Rebecca has $10 in her wallet and wants to buy something from one of three groups: A, B, or C. The prices of these groups are as follows:
Group A: $20
Group B: $30
Group C: $40
So, Rebecca can afford to buy anything from Group A, which costs $20. She cannot afford to buy anything from Group B or Group C because their prices exceed her budget of $10. Therefore, the only option available for Rebecca is Group A."
"Response: 
Rebeka wants to divide 10 marbles and 15 dimers among 5 people in one bag. So, we need to find out how many marbles or dimers each person will get.
To do this, we can use division. We know that Rebeka has 10 marbles and 15 dimers altogether, so let's divide them equally among 5 people:

Marbles: 10 / 5 = 2 marbles per person
Dimmers: 15 / 5 = 3 dimers per person

So, each of the 5 people will get 2 marbles and 3 dimers from Rebeka."
"Response:  The group has 11 members and each member can contribute 2 dimers to the group. So, the total number of dimers contributed by Rebeka is:

11 x 2 = 22 dimers"
"Response: 
Rebeka has to divide 4 groups of 6 people each among 7 dimers (a group of 7 people). So, she needs to divide 4 x 6 = 24 people into 7 groups.
Since there are 16 people in total, including Rebeka herself, and each group must have at least one person from each dimer, we can conclude that each group will have at most 3 members from any single dimer.
Therefore, the number of dimers that each group will consist of is:
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of members per group = 24 / 3 = 8
So, each group will consist of 8 members, and Rebeka will be left with 1 member who doesn't belong to any group."
"Response:  We have to divide Rebeka's collection among three groups of people. The number of dimers in each group will be determined by dividing the total number of dimers (40) by the number of groups (3). So, each group will get 13 dimers (40 / 3 = 13). Since there are 15 dimers in total, we can distribute them as follows: Group 1 - 13 dimers; Group 2 - 13 dimers; Group 3 - none (since they already have 13 dimers)."
"Response: 
Rebeka has 18 dimers, and each dimer can hold 3 grams of sugar. So, Rebeka can make 18 x 3 = 54 grams of sugar.
Now, there are 72 kilograms of sugar in total, so we need to divide 54 grams by 72 kilograms to find out how many groups Rebeka can make.
So, 54 grams / 72 kilograms = 0.75 groups. Therefore, Rebeka can make approximately 0.75 groups."
"Response: 
Rebeka has 99 colleagues in total, including 9 dimers and 27 marbles. To form three groups of equal size, we need to divide them into groups such that each group contains an equal number of people (colleagues).
So, let's start with dividing Rebeka's colleagues into groups of 30 each. We can do this by taking 30 colleagues from the general pool of 99 and forming three groups of 30 each. Now, let's see how many dimers and marbles are left over after forming these groups.
After grouping 30 colleagues, there will be 69 remaining colleagues (9 - 30 = 69). Among these 69 colleagues, there are 9 dimers and 27 marbles. So, the final distribution of dimers and marbles among the three groups would be:
Group 1: 3 dimers + 8 marbles (from the original 9)
Group 2: 4 dimers + 15 marbles (from the original 27)
Group 3: 2 dimers + 14 marbles (from the original 27)
Therefore, the three groups formed based on Rebeka's colleagues would have the following composition:
Group 1: 30 colleagues (including 3 dimers and 8 marbles)
Group 2: 30 colleagues (including 4 dimers and 15 marbles)
Group 3: 30 colleagues (including 2 dimers and 14 marbles)"
Response:  Rebeka has 20 dimers and 6 marbles in her bag. Each dimer can hold 4 marbles, so she has a total of 80 marbles (20 x 4 = 80). Therefore, there are 80 + 6 = 86 marbles in Rebeka's bag.
Response:  Rebeka has 20 people in her team and each person needs to carry 5 marbles in their bag. So, Rebeka needs to carry 5 x 20 = 100 marbles in total. Additionally, there are 12 dimers in the game, so each player needs to carry 12 / 20 = 3/4 of a dime in their bag. Therefore, Rebeka needs to carry 100 + (3/4) x 12 = 100 + 9 = 109 marbles in total.
Response:  If Luka plays one round of Tribe Game and scores 154 points, then he will score an average of 11 points per round (154/13). So, if he plays 13 rounds, he will score 13 x 11 = 143 points in total.
"Response: 
Round 177 - 46 = 131
Each round has 48 points to distribute among the players. So in Round 177, each player got 131 / 48 = 2.75 points."
Response:  If they scored 84 points in each round of the game, then they would have scored a total of 84 x 2 = 168 points in both rounds combined. So, the number of points they scored per round is 168 / 2 = 84 points per round.
"Response: 
Luk is running at 146 paces per round. If he runs one round of 157 rounds, then he will cover a distance of:

Distance = Number of paces x Distance per pace
= 146 x 157
= 21,322 meters

So Luk covers a distance of 21,322 meters in one round of 157 rounds."
Response:  If they took 3 pennies for each round and there were 78 rounds in total, then the number of pennies taken = Total number of rounds x Number of pennies per round. So, the answer is 78 x 3 = 234 pennies.
"Response: 
Emily has two friends, A and B. Emily lost $20 to each of her friends. So, she lost a total of $40.
Now, let's find out how much money each friend received from Emily as a loan.
Friend A received $20 from Emily, so he has $20 + $40 = $60 in total.
Friend B received $20 from Emily, so he has $20 + $40 = $60 in total.
Therefore, there are 32 people who have received money from Emily (2 x 16)."
"Response: 
Emili has 11 friends and each friend of Emili has lost $28 due to Emili's mistake. So, in total, Emili has caused harm worth $28 x 11 = $308."
"Response: 
Emily has 8 friends and each friend of Emily loses $16 in every harvest. So, in total, Emily's friends lose $128 per harvest. Now, let's calculate how much money Emily can collect from her friends in one harvest. Since there are 8 friends, she can collect $128 x 8 = $1024 in one harvest. Therefore, Emily can collect a maximum of $1024 per harvest."
"Response: 
Emily has 18 friends and each friend of Emily has lost $6 due to her mistake. So, in total, Emily needs to return $108 ($18 x $6) to her friends."
"Response: 
Emili has 5 friends and each friend of Emili loses $5 due to Emili's mistake. So, in total, Emili owes $25 ($5 x 5). Now, Emili gives $4 to each of her 4 friends who lost money due to her mistake, so she now owes $16 ($4 x 4). Therefore, the number of moneys that Emili had was $16."
"Response: 
Emily has 72 friends and each friend of hers loses $30 due to her mistake. So, Emily needs to return $2160 to her friends. Now, since there are 6 people in total who lost money, each person will get back $35 (6 x $30 = $180). Therefore, Emily can give back $180 to each of the 6 people she wronged, which adds up to $1140. This means that Emily still owes $1020 to her remaining 65 friends ($2160 - $1140 = $1020)."
"Response: 

Emily has 43 friends and each friend of Emily has lost $20 due to her mistake. So, in total, Emily has lost $860 ($43 x $20).

Now, let's calculate how many manis (a unit of money) Emily needs to pay as compensation for each loss. Since there are 5 losses, Emily needs to pay 5 x $20 = $100 per loss. Therefore, the total amount that Emily needs to pay as compensation is $860 / $100 = 8.6 manis."
"Response: 
Emily has 44 friends and each friend of Emily loses $26 due to her mistake. So, in total, Emily owes $1172 (44 x $26)."
"Response: 
819056 people were in the countryside during the time of Grameen Bank's operation (1972-2014). Of these, 366282 people lived in rural areas and 452874 people lived in urban areas. So, there are 366282/819056 = 0.445 or approximately 44.5% of the total population living in rural areas. Similarly, there are 452874/819056 = 0.545 or approximately 54.5% of the total population living in urban areas. Therefore, among those who live in rural areas, approximately 44.5% of them are children, and among those who live in urban areas, approximately 54.5% of them are children."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that in Grameen Kalyan Sangstha (GKS) schools, there are 202958 students studying at present.

Now, let's find out how many of them are studying in each classroom. We can assume an average number of students per classroom to be around 30-40 students. So, dividing the total number of students with the number of classrooms, we get:

Number of students per classroom = Total number of students / Number of classrooms
= 202958 / x

where 'x' is the number of classrooms. Since GKS has 777622 classrooms, we can calculate the number of students per classroom as follows:

Number of students per classroom = Total number of students / Number of classrooms
= 202958 / 777622
= 0.26 or approximately 26 students per classroom.

So, if all 202958 students were to study in one classroom, it would accommodate approximately 26 students. However, since not all students attend school at the same time, the actual number of students studying in each classroom may vary depending on the timing and shift of their classes."
"Response:

Firstly, we know that there are 907611 students in Grameen Kalyan School. (Question)
Now, out of these students, 455682 students are studying in Class 1 to Class 4. (Question)
So, the number of students who are not studying in these classes is:
907611 - 455682 = 451929. (Subtraction)
Therefore, there are 451929 students who are studying in other classes than Classes 1 to 4 in Grameen Kalyan School."
"Response: 

1. The number of students in Grameen Kalyan School at 8 am is 80059. (Given)
2. Out of these, most of them are present in the school campus. (Assumption)
3. Therefore, the number of students who are not present in the school campus is less than or equal to 8285. (Subtraction from Step 1)
4. So, the number of students who are present in their homes is 79765 - 8285 = 71480. (Subtraction from Step 3)

Therefore, around 71480 students are present in their homes at 8 am."
"Response: 
The total number of students in Grameen Kalyan School at 6:15 am is 619.
Now, let's find out how many students are present in each classroom.
According to the information given, there are 7 classes in the school with an average of 8-9 students per classroom. So, the total number of students in each classroom = Total number of classes x Average number of students per classroom.
Classrooms = Number of classes / Average number of students per classroom
= 7 / 8-9
= 2 - 3
So, there are either 2 or 3 classrooms in the school.
Now, we need to find out how many students are present in each classroom.
Let's assume that there are 2 classrooms in the school, and each classroom has an average of 8 students. Therefore, the total number of students in both classrooms = 2 x 8 = 16.
So, there are 16 students in each classroom."

Keti has 81 games and her friend has 59 games. So, Keti has more games than her friend.
To find out how many more games Keti has, we need to subtract the number of games her friend has from the number of games Keti has.
So, the difference between the number of games Keti has (81) and the number of games her friend has (59) is:
81 - 59 = 22
Therefore, Keti has 22 more games than her friend."
"Response: 

Firstly, there were 91 games in Ketki's collection before she made new friends. So, the number of games in her old collection is 91.

Now, Ketki made new friends and their combined collection had 88 games. So, the total number of games among all her friends (old + new) is 91 + 88 = 179 games.

Finally, out of these 179 games, 53 games belonged to Puran, who was one of Ketki's old friends. Therefore, the number of games that Puran owned is 53."

2nd week (Shonibar): Fred deposited Rs 30 more into his account, so now he has Rs 141. And Jeshna also deposited Rs 20, so her balance is now Rs 60. Their total amount remains the same at Rs 151.
3rd week (Rabibara): Fred withdrew Rs 20 from his account, leaving him with Rs 121. And Jeshna deposited Rs 30, increasing her balance to Rs 90. Their total amount decreases to Rs 121 + Rs 90 = Rs 211.
So, the final answer is Rs 211."
"Response: 

1st week (49 dollars):
Given that Fred earned $49 in the first week, and he spent $30 on gas, so his remaining amount is: $49 - $30 = $19.
2nd week (3 days):
Fred worked for 3 days in the second week, and he earned $8 per day. So, his earnings in the second week are: $8 x 3 = $24.
Total earnings after 2 weeks: $19 + $24 = $43.
3rd week (Jessie's article):
Jessie wrote an article that earned him $65. Since Jessie already had $30, his total earnings after the third week are: $30 + $65 = $95.

Therefore, as of today, the farmer has 67 tomatoes in his bag."
"Response: 
Given information:
160 tomatoes were in the farmer's bag yesterday.
The farmer gave away 56 tomatoes today.
Now there are 41 tomatoes left in the bag.
To find out how many tomatoes the farmer had before giving any away, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes given away from the total number of tomatoes he had yesterday.
So, the number of tomatoes the farmer had before giving any away is:
160 - 56 = 104
Therefore, the farmer had 104 tomatoes in his bag before giving any away."

The farmer had 177 tomatoes and 13 apples in his bag initially. When he took out 53 tomatoes, how many tomatoes were left?
Tomatoes = Initial quantity - Quantity taken out = 177 - 53 = 124
So, there are 124 tomatoes left in the bag.
Now, let's find out how many apples are left. We know that the farmer had 13 apples initially, and he took out 0 apples, so the number of apples remains the same. Therefore, there are still 13 apples in the bag."
"Response: 
The farmer had 105 tomatoes in red and 71 tomatoes in green. When he picked 137 tomatoes, how many of each color will remain?
Red Tomatoes = Original Red Tomatoes - Picked Red Tomatoes = 105 - 137 = 32
Green Tomatoes = Original Green Tomatoes - Picked Green Tomatoes = 71 - 0 = 71
So, there will be 32 red tomatoes and 71 green tomatoes left after picking 137 tomatoes."
"Response: 
For each kilo of rice, we need to use at least 4 plastic bags for packaging. So, if we want to package 40 kg of rice, we will need at least 160 plastic bags (4 x 40).
However, since some people may require more than two plastic bags per kilo of rice, let's assume that 20% of them will require an additional bag, which means we will need 176 plastic bags in total (160 + 16).

The number of sharts taken in total = 9 + 44 = 53
Now, let's find out how many sharts are taken per minute.
Number of sharts taken per minute = Total number of sharts / Time taken to take those sharts
Time taken to take 9 sharts = 9 x (1/3) = 9 minutes
Time taken to take 44 sharts = 44 x (1/3) = 14.67 minutes (approximately 14 minutes and 40 seconds)
Therefore, the number of sharts taken per minute is:
Number of sharts taken per minute = 9 / 9 minutes = 1 shart every 9 minutes
So, the yantra took 9 sharts in total in one day, and it takes approximately 1 shart every 9 minutes."
"Response: 
The company has been producing 13 types of shirts per day for the past few days and today it will produce 3 more types. So, in total, the company will produce 16 types of shirts (13 + 3) per day.

Luis has 10 packs of cookies and each pack contains 4 cookies. So, Luis has a total of 10 x 4 = 40 cookies.
Now, he gives away 20 cookies to his friend. So, after giving them away, Luis has 40 - 20 = 20 cookies left with him."
Response:  We know that Lucia bought 4 kg of sugar, 22 kg of rice, and 16 kg of wheat flour. So, in total, she bought 4 + 22 + 16 = 42 kg of groceries.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of rice are needed for each person in a family of 4 members. So, we need to divide the total number of packets (4) by the number of people in the family (4). Therefore, the answer is 1 packet per person or 4 packets in total.
"Response: 
Luis bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes. Each pack contains 4 cups of cookies and 6 cups of cakes. So, he purchased a total of:
Cookies: 2 x 4 = 8 cups
Cakes: 12 x 6 = 72 cups
Total quantity: 8 + 72 = 80 cups
Now, let's convert it to money. The cost of each cup of cookie is $0.50 and that of cake is $0.30. Therefore, Luis paid a total amount of:
Cookie cost: 8 x $0.50 = $4.00
Cake cost: 72 x $0.30 = $21.60
Total cost: $4.00 + $21.60 = $25.60
So, Luis spent a total of $25.60 for buying 80 cups of cookies and cakes from Grocery Store."

Firstly, we know that there were initially 12 people in the basement.

Then, after some time, 4 more people entered the basement.

Now, let's calculate how many people are currently in the basement:

Initially, there were 12 people x 36 = 432 square feet per person.

After 4 more people entered, the total area of the basement increased to 432 square feet + (4 x 36) = 432 square feet + 1592 square feet = 1984 square feet.

So, there are currently 1984 / 36 = 57 people in the basement."

"Response: 
Given that Gohaat has 919 feet of gutta-percha and he wants to make 1307 feet of gum. So, we need to find out how many times Gohaat can stretch his gutta-percha.
To do this, divide the total length of gutta-percha (919 ft) by the length of gum he wants to make (1307 ft).
$$ \frac{919}{1307} = x $$
Now, solve for $x$.
$$ x = \frac{919}{1307} = 0.685 $$
So, Gohaat can stretch his gutta-percha $\boxed{\text{685}}$ times to make 1307 feet of gum."
"Response: 
Gujhaati has 1218 feet in length and 849 feet in width. If they build a wall around it that is 17 feet thick, how much more land will Gujhaati gain?

So, we need to find out the area of the wall. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = l x w, where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the length of the wall (l) is 17 feet, and the width (w) is half the length of Gujhaati, which is 849 feet / 2 = 424.5 feet.
Now, we multiply the length and width to get the area of the wall: A = l x w = 17 x 424.5 = 6,939 square feet.
Now, we subtract the area of the wall from the total area of Gujhaati to find out how much more land Gujhaati gains: Total Area - Area of Wall = 1218 x 849 - 6,939 = 90,871 square feet.
Therefore, Gujhaati gains an additional 90,871 square feet of land due to the construction of the wall."
Response:  If they can walk 659 feet in 1 minute and 49 seconds (which is equal to 0.78 miles per minute), then in 7 minutes and 28 seconds (which is equal to 4.63 miles), they will be able to cover a distance of 4.63 x 7 = 31.71 miles. So, after walking for 7 more minutes and 28 seconds, they will have covered an additional distance of 31.71 - 659 = 627.31 feet.
Response:  The number of pencils required to draw an outline of a circle with radius 8 cm is given as 8 in the problem statement. So, we need to divide 8 by 2 to get the number of pencil marks needed for each segment of the circle.

"Response: 

Firstly, we know that there are 7 big fish and 12 small fish in total. So, the total number of fish is 7 + 12 = 19.

Now, let's consider the situation where some of the big fish have babies. If each big fish has an average of 3 babies (which may not be exact but for simplicity, let's assume so), then the total number of baby fish will be 7 x 3 = 21.

So, the total number of fish now becomes 19 + 21 = 40.

Finally, if some of the small fish also give birth to babies, let's say half of them do (again, this is just an assumption), then the total number of newborn fish will be 12 x 0.5 = 6.

Therefore, the final number of fish in the pond is 40 - 6 = 34."

Response:  The total number of apples was 58. If 35 were used for making pies, then the remaining amount is 23 (58 - 35). So, among the options given in the question, option A (23) is the correct answer.
"Response: 

The total number of apples in the basket = 40 + 54 = 94

After some people took turns to take apples, there were 39 left.

So, the number of apples taken by each person = Total number of apples - Number of apples left after taking turns / Number of people who took turns
= 94 - 39 / 4 (as there were 4 people who took turns)
= 27

Therefore, each person took 27 apples."
