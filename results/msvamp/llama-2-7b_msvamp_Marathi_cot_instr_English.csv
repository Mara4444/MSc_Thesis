Response:  Julie has 18 tags and she gives 5 to Somwar. So, Somwar now has 5 + 13 = 18 tags in total. Now, Mangalwar has 10 tags from Julie, so he has 10 + 5 = 15 tags in total. Finally, Mangalwar gets 10 more tags from Somwar, so his total number of tags is 15 + 10 = 25 tags. Therefore, the correct answer is 25.
Response:  On Monday, July 11th, there are 11 days left until Sunday, August 12th. So, in these 11 days, Mangalvar will be present for 12 times (since each week has 7 days). Therefore, Mangalvar will be present for 12 x 11 = 132 times during this period.
Response:  Julie has 5 tags and she gives one tag to Somwar. So, now Julie has 4 tags left. Then, Mangalwar takes one of those tags from Julie, so now Julie has 3 tags left. Now, let's calculate how many tags Mangalwar will get if he takes one tag from Julie every time she has 3 tags left. If Julie had 15 tags initially, then she gave away 5 tags to Somwar, leaving her with 4 tags. When Mangalwar took one tag from her, she was left with 3 tags, and he took one more tag from her, leaving her with none. Therefore, the number of tags Mangalwar gets is equal to the number of times Julie had 3 tags left minus the number of tags she gave away to Somwar. In this case, that would be 15 - 5 = 10 tags.
Response:  Julie has 14 tags and Somwari has 16 tags. So, if we want to know how many tags Somwari has after giving 2 extra tags to Julie, we can simply subtract the number of tags that Julie has from the total number of tags that Somwari has. Therefore, the answer is:  Somwari has 16 - 14 = 2 more tags than Julie.
Response:  Julie has 16 tags and she gives 4 of them to Somvar. So, Julie now has 12 tags left. If Somvar gets 12 more tags from somewhere else, then he will have 24 tags in total. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  Julie has 14 marbles in her pocket and she gives 8 of them to Somwaru. Now, how many marbles does Somwaru have? So, Somwaru has 8 more marbles than what Julie had initially. Therefore, the answer is 8 + 14 = 22 marbles.
Response:  Julie starts work at 10 am and takes a break from 2 pm to 4 pm. So, she works for 6 hours in total. Now, let's calculate how many breaks she took -  Break time = Total working hours / Number of breaks taken x Time duration of each break  In this case, we know that Julie worked for 6 hours and took 3 breaks (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, we can calculate the time duration of each break as follows - Break time = 6 hours / 3 breaks x Time duration of each break = 6 hours / 3 breaks x 2 hours = 4 hours per break  Hence, Julie took 4 breaks in total.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia), there are 7 days in a week. So, the number of days between Sunday and Monday is 7 - 1 = 6 days. Similarly, the number of days between Monday and Tuesday is 7 - 2 = 5 days, and so on until we reach Buddhavar (97). Therefore, the total number of days between Sunday and Buddhavar is: 6 + 5 +... + 3 + 2 + 1 = 480 days.
Response:  On Sunday (Julie), there are 5 working days left, i.e., Monday to Friday (9 days). So, the total number of working days in July is 9 + 5 = 14 working days.
Response:  Julie starts work at 9 am and takes a break from 12 pm to 1 pm. She then works for another 4 hours after her lunch break, so she finishes work at 5 pm. Therefore, Mangalwar and Budhavari both have 8 working hours (from 9 am to 5 pm).
Response:  Julie has 9 mangoes in July, 7 mangoes in August, and 96 mangoes in September. So, in total, she has 103 mangoes (9 + 7 + 96).
"Response:  Julie has 14 moles of skin, Mangal has 2 moles of hair, and Buddha has 8 moles of skin. So, if we combine all these amounts, we get:

Julie + Mangal + Buddha = 14 + 2 + 8 = 24 moles
Therefore, Buddha has 24/8 = 3 moles of skin more than Julie."
Response:  Julie is born on July 8th and will be 8 months old on March 11th. Buddha was born on April 8th and will be 9 months old on January 9th. So, Mangalwar is between Buddha and Julie in age. Therefore, Mangalwar is 8 months old.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia), there are 15 hours. On Monday (Mangalwar), there are 18 hours. And on Tuesday (Budhavar), there are 7 hours. So, Budhavari has the least number of hours among these three days. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  Julie has 13 cards in her hand and Mangal has 10 cards in his hand. So, the total number of cards is 13 + 10 = 23 cards.
Response:  Julie has 7 days in July and 13 days in August. So, she has a total of 20 days in those two months. Now, let's calculate how many tags she can make in each month. In July, she can make 7 tags per day, so she can make a total of 7 x 20 = 140 tags in that month. Similarly, in August, she can make 13 tags per day, so she can make a total of 13 x 20 = 260 tags in that month. Therefore, Julie can make a total of 140 + 260 = 380 tags in both months combined.
Response:  Julie has 12 tags and Mangal has 14 tags. So, in total they have 12 + 14 = 26 tags. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for them to wear all these tags. If each tag is worn for 30 days, then Julie will wear her 12 tags for 30 x 12 = 360 days, and Mangal will wear his 14 tags for 30 x 14 = 420 days. Therefore, the total number of days it will take for both of them to wear all their tags is 360 + 420 = 780 days.
Response:  Julie has 19 tags and Mangalwari has 18 tags. So, in total, they have 37 tags.
Response:  On Monday, Julie had 5 moles of tag. On Tuesday, she added 2 more moles of tag. So, now she has 7 moles of tag (5 + 2 = 7). Now, on Wednesday, she lost 3 moles of tag. So, now she has 4 moles of tag (7 - 3 = 4). Finally, on Thursday, she gained 1 mole of tag, so now she has 5 moles of tag again (4 + 1 = 5). Therefore, Julie had 5 moles of tag on Friday.
Response:  Julie has 18 mulabars and she gives 3 to Somvar. So, now Julie has 15 mulabars left. On Monday, she gets 4 more mulabars from someone. Now, Julie has 19 mulabars in total. But then, she gives 2 mulabars to Mangalwar. So, now Julie has 17 mulabars left with her. Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  Julie has four friends - Tanya, Rohan, Aishwarya and Nandini. They have decided to go for a trek together on Sunday (July 3) and Monday ( July 17). So, Budhavarsha is going to be alone on those days. Therefore, the number of days that Budhavarsha will spend with his friends is 4 - 2 = 2 days.
Response:  Bob has 25 chocolates and he eats 43 of them. So, after he finishes eating all those chocolates, how many chocolates will be left with him?  Therefore, there will be 12 chocolates left with Bob (25 - 43 = 12).
Response:  Bob has eaten 28 chocolates and now he has 42 left. If he eats 63 more chocolates, then he will have 105 chocolates in total. So, Bob has eaten 105 - 28 = 77 good chocolates.
Response:  Bob has 33 chocolates and he eats 4 of them. So, he has 29 chocolates left. If each chocolate contains 14 pieces, then Bob has a total of 29 x 14 = 406 pieces of chocolate left. Therefore, Bob has 406 pieces of chocolate and 14 candies.
Response:  Bob has 38 chocolates and he eats 16 of them. So, he has 22 chocolates left. Now, let's calculate how many chocolate pieces are left in each box. If there were originally 36 chocolate pieces per box, then after Bob ate 16 of them, there would be 16/36 = 0.44 (or 44%) fewer chocolate pieces in each box. Therefore, Bob has 38 - 0.44 \* 36 = 35.76 chocolate pieces left overall.
Response:  Bob has eaten 20 chocolates and has left 34 chocolates. So, he has eaten 18 chocolates (20 - 34 = 18).
Response:  Bob has eaten 21 chocolates and wants to know how many he will have left if he eats 5 more. So, after eating 5 more, Bob will have 26 chocolates (21 + 5). Now, there are 9 chocolates left in total (26 - 9 = 17).
Response:  Bob has eaten 22 chocolates and there are 5 left. So, if Bob eats 8 more chocolates, then he will have eaten a total of 30 chocolates (22 + 8). Therefore, the number of chocolates that Bob has left is 5 - 30 = -25.
Response:  Bob has 19 chocolates and he eats 2 of them. So, now Bob has 17 chocolates left. If each chocolate is good for him, then the number of good chocolates Bob has is equal to the total number of chocolates he had minus the number of chocolates he ate. Therefore, the answer is 17 - 2 = 15 good chocolates for Bob.
Response:  Bob has 32 chocolates and he wants to share them equally among 5 of his friends. So, each friend will get 6 chocolates (32/5 = 6). Now, there are 20 chocolates left with Bob. Therefore, out of these 20 chocolates, Bob can give 10 chocolates to each of his remaining 4 friends (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  Bob has 17 chocolates and he gave 5 to Maggie. So, Bob now has 12 chocolates left (17 - 5 = 12). Now, we need to find out how many chocolates Maggie got from Bob. If Maggie got 36 chocolates more than Bob, then Maggie has 36 + 12 = 48 chocolates in total.
Response:  Bob has 23 chocolates and he wants to share them equally among 4 of his friends. So, each friend will get 5 chocolates (23/4 = 5). Now, there are 30 pieces of chocolate left over after sharing with the friends. Therefore, the number of chocolates that Bob has left is 30 - 5 = 25.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Allen can throw in 5 seconds and how many balls Jack can catch in 3 seconds.  Since Allen can throw one ball every second, he can throw 5 balls in 5 seconds (5 x 1 = 5). Similarly, since Jack can catch one ball every second, he can catch 3 balls in 3 seconds (3 x 1 = 3). Therefore, there are 2 more balls that Allen can throw than Jack can catch (5 - 3 = 2).
Response:  If Alan can throw two balls at once and Jack can throw three balls at once, then in total, Alan can throw 2 x 2 = 4 balls per minute, while Jack can throw 3 x 3 = 9 balls per minute. So, if they both start throwing balls simultaneously, after 1 minute, Alan will have thrown 4 balls, while Jack will have thrown 9 balls. Therefore, Jack has thrown 5 more balls than Alan (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  Alan and Jack have 3 balls between them. If they share equally, each will get 1 ball. Now, if Jack takes 2 balls from Alan, then Jack has 3 balls (the original 2 plus the one he took from Alan) and Alan has none left. So, the number of balls that Jack has is 3.
Response:  Jack has 6 balls and he gives away 4 more balls to someone else. So now Jack has 2 balls left with him. Now if he gives away 3 more balls to another person, then how many balls will Jack have after giving away those 3 balls? Solution:  After giving away 3 more balls, Jack will have 1 ball left with him.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Allen can throw in 5 seconds. Since he throws one ball every second, he will throw 5 balls in total. Now, if Jack takes 6 more balls than Allen, then Jack will take 6 x 5 = 30 balls in total. So, the difference between the number of balls taken by Jack and Allen is 30 - 5 = 25 balls.
Response:  Alan has 3 balls and Jack has 5 balls. If they exchange 2 balls each, then:  Alan has 3 + 2 = 5 balls now. Jack had 5 - 2 = 3 balls now. So, there are 3 balls left with Jack.
Response:  We have two balls in one basket and four balls in another basket. If we take three balls from the first basket, then there will be two balls left in that basket. Similarly, if we take four balls from the second basket, then there will be zero balls left in that basket. So, the number of balls left in the second basket after taking four balls is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is (0).
Response:  We have two balls - one red and one blue. They are in different boxes - one with three red balls and another with three blue balls. Now we want to know how many more balls of each color there will be if we put both boxes together. So, let's count the total number of balls in both boxes: Red balls in first box = 3 Blue balls in second box = 3 Total number of balls = 6 (red + blue) Since there are six balls in total, if we add them together, we get: Red balls + blue balls = 6 + 3 = 9 Therefore, there are nine balls in total - five red and four blue.
Response:  We know that Alen had 5 balls and Jack took 4 balls from him. So, now Alen has 3 balls left. Now, we are asked how many balls Alen had in total before he gave any to Jack. Therefore, the answer is 8 (5 + 3).
Response:  We have two balls - Alan and Jack. They are playing basketball in a park with three hoops of different heights (20 feet, 15 feet, and 10 feet). If we assume that each ball has an equal chance of going through any of these hoops, then the probability of Alan making a shot is 3/6 = 0.5, since there are three hoops and he can make one shot at each hoop. Similarly, the probability of Jack making a shot is also 0.5. Now, let's calculate the average number of baskets made per hour for both Alan and Jack separately: For Alan: Number of shots taken = 3 x 10 = 30 Shots made successfully = 30 / 6 = 5 Successful shots per hour For Jack: Number of shots taken = 3 x 10 = 30 Shots made successfully = 30 / 6 = 5 Successful shots per hour Since they take turns shooting, their combined average number of successful shots per hour will be the sum of their individual averages: Average successful shots per hour = 5 + 5 = 10 So, if they play for one hour, they will make approximately 10 successful baskets together.
"Response:  We have three frog eggs in one bowl and four frogs in another bowl. Each frog lays about 30 eggs at a time. So, if we assume that each egg takes 24 hours to hatch, then:

Number of eggs laid by first frog = Number of frog eggs in one bowl / Time taken for an egg to hatch (24 hours) = 3 eggs/day x 7 days = 21 eggs

Number of eggs laid by second frog = Number of frog eggs in other bowl / Time taken for an egg to hatch (24 hours) = 4 eggs/day x 7 days = 28 eggs

Total number of eggs laid = Number of eggs laid by first frog + Number of eggs laid by second frog = 21 eggs + 28 eggs = 59 eggs

So, there are approximately 59 eggs in total."
Response:  We know that Alan has 5 balls and Jack takes 6 balls from him. So, after taking the balls, Jack has 3 balls left with him. Now, we need to find out how many balls are there in the park. As per the question, there are 8 balls in the park. Therefore, the final number of balls with Jack is:  Number of balls with Jack = Total number of balls in the park - Number of balls taken by Jack = 8 - 3 = 5 balls.
Response:  If Alen has 3 balls and Jack takes 20 balls, then Alen will have 5 balls left (3 - 20 = 5). Now, if Jack takes another 59 balls, he will have 59 + 5 = 64 balls in total. So, the final number of balls that Jack has is 64.
Response:  We have 7 balls in one bowl and 5 balls in another bowl. Together we have 12 balls (7 + 5). Now, we take 6 balls from the first bowl and add them to the second bowl, making it 13 balls (6 + 7). Finally, we take 4 balls from the second bowl and put them back into the first bowl, leaving us with 9 balls in total (7 + 5 - 4). So, there are 9 balls left after all the counting.
Response:  We know that Allen has 5 balls and Jack has 6 balls. Now we need to find out how many balls Jack has after giving one ball to Allen. So, Jack had 6 balls initially and gave 1 ball to Allen, so now he has 5 balls left. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We have two balls in one park and three balls in another park. If we take six balls from the first park, how many balls will be left there? The answer is three.
Response:  Darroj and Rayan are both able to speak English fluently, so they can communicate with each other without any problem. Now, let's consider how many times Chini will be able to communicate with them in English. Since Chini is not fluent in English, she will need help from someone who speaks both Marathi and English to translate what she wants to say into English. So, we can assume that there will be two translators involved in every conversation between Chini and Darroj or Rayan - one for translation from Marathi to English and another for translation from English back to Marathi. Therefore, the total number of times Chini will be able to communicate with Darroj or Rayan in English will be half the number of times she communicates with them directly in Marathi.
Response:  Darroj is able to speak English fluently and can understand up to 7 tones of Chinese. If he wants to learn more than 8 tones of Chinese, how many hours will it take him?  Therefore, the answer is 8 hours.
Response:  Darroj Rajan has three tassels of Indian silk and one tassel of Chinese silk. If he sells each tassel of Indian silk for Rs. 400, then how many tassels of Chinese silk will he sell to earn an amount equal to Rs. 1200? Solution: We know that Darroj Rajan has one tassel of Chinese silk, which costs him Rs. 400. To earn an amount equal to Rs. 1200, he needs to sell 3 more tassels of Chinese silk. So, the number of tassels of Chinese silk he will sell is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Darryl speaks English fluently and can understand Chinese to some extent, then he can communicate with Chinese people in English. However, if he wants to learn Chinese, it will take him at least 2 years to become proficient in speaking and understanding the language. Therefore, the number of years it will take for Darryl to learn Chinese is 2.
Response:  We know that Darroj can speak 5 languages fluently - Marathi, Hindi, English, Gujarati and Sindhi. So he can communicate in these five languages without any difficulty. Now, let's assume that there are 10 people in total who need to communicate with Darroj. Out of them, 3 people can only speak Hindi, 2 people can only speak English, and 1 person can only speak Gujarati. The remaining 4 people can speak all three languages (Hindi, English, and Gujarati). Therefore, the total number of people who can communicate with Darroj in each language is as follows:  Hindi: 3 + 2 = 5 people can communicate with Darroj in Hindi. English: 2 + 1 = 3 people can communicate with Darroj in English. Gujarati: 1 + 4 = 5 people can communicate with Darroj in Gujarati. In conclusion, out of the 10 people, a total of 15 people can communicate with Darroj in at least one language.
Response:  Darroj is able to speak English and Chinese for 5 days each. So in total, he can speak English for 25 days (5 x 5) and Chinese for 15 days (5 x 3). Therefore, his total ability to speak languages is 40 days (25 + 15).
Response:  Darroj and Saha are both from India, so they speak Hindi.  Since they are both from India, they can understand each other without any difficulty.  Now, let's come to the main point of the question - how many days does it take for an Indian person to learn Chinese?  Well, we know that Darroj is able to speak five words in Chinese after two months of learning, which means he has learned at a rate of one word per day.  Similarly, Saha takes five days to learn ten words in Chinese, which means she learns at a rate of one word every two hours.  So, if Darroj and Saha were to study together, they would be able to learn Chinese at a combined rate of one word every hour and a half!
Response:  Darroj can speak English for 5 days and Chini can speak Chinese for 4 days. So in total, they can communicate with each other for 9 days (5 + 4).
Response:  Darroj can speak English for 8 hours and Chinese for 6 hours per day. If he works for 86 days, how many hours will he be able to speak English and Chinese in total?  English: 8 x 86 = 672 hours  Chinese: 6 x 86 = 504 hours Total: 672 + 504 = 1176 hours
Response:  Darroj (D) can speak English fluently, Sat (S) can speak Chinese fluently and three (T) can speak Spanish fluently. So, among them, D can speak 4 languages fluently (English, Hindi, Chinese, and Spanish).
Response:  Darroj Rajan has 30 tassels of Indian silk and 58 tassels of Spanish silk. So, he has in total 88 tassels of silk. Now, if we want to know how many tassels of Indian silk Chini can make with 12 tassels of Indian silk, we need to divide the number of tassels of Indian silk that Chini has (12) by the number of tassels of Indian silk that Darroj has (30). This gives us a ratio of 12/30 = 0.4. Therefore, Chini can make approximately 0.4 x 88 = 35 tassels of Indian silk.
Response:  We know that Darron has 7 t-shirts and he wants to exchange them with Spaniards.  If each Spanish person can take 2 t-shirts, then how many t-shirts will be left for Darron after exchanging them with Spaniards?  Solution:  Total number of t-shirts = 7 (Darron's) x 2 (number of t-shirts each Spanish person can take) = 14 t-shirts. So, there will be 7 t-shirts left for Darron after exchanging them with Spaniards.
Response:  We know that Darroj has 2 tonnes of rice and Chini has 5 tonnes of rice. So, in total, they have 7 tonnes of rice (2 + 5 = 7). Now, we are asked how many tonnes of rice each person will get if there are 4 people in total. To find this out, we need to divide the total amount of rice by the number of people. So, 7 tonnes of rice / 4 people = 1.75 tonnes of rice per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 1.75 tonnes of rice.
Response:  Darroj has 3 tonnes of English and 2 tonnes of Chinese. So if he gives away 1 tone of English, how much Chinese will he have left? Therefore, Darroj has 2 tones of Chinese left.
Response:  We know that Rayan can speak English and Chinese fluently. So, he can communicate with people in these languages without any difficulty. Now, let's calculate how many days it would take for him to learn each language.  For English, he has already been learning for 7 days, so he has learned half of it (i.e., 3.5 days). Therefore, it will take him another 3.5 days to fully learn English.  Similarly, for Chinese, he has already been learning for 4 days, so he has learned half of it (i.e., 2 days). Therefore, it will take him another 2 days to fully learn Chinese.  Thus, in total, Rayan will need 5.5 days to learn both English and Chinese fluently.
Response:  On Sunday ( Somvar ), there are 8 bags of rice. If we subtract 2 bags for each day from Monday to Saturday ( except Sunday ), then how many bags of rice will be left on Sunday? So, the answer is 6 bags of rice will be left on Sunday.
"Response:  On Sunday (7th), Tifanny had 30 pizzas. On Monday (8th), she sold 12 more pizzas. So, on Monday, Tifanny had 42 pizzas (30 + 12). Now, let's find out how many pizzas Tifanny will have on Wednesday (12th) if she sells 6 more pizzas every day. Day 1 = 42 pizzas; Day 2 = 42 x 1.06 = 44 pizzas; Day 3 = 44 x 1.06 = 46 pizzas; and so on... Therefore, on Wednesday (12th), Tifanny will have 50 pizzas (46 x 1.06)."
Response:  According to the question, Tifanny Reshikaal karne wali ladki ko kitna pishwaa saapdilayi? So, we have to find out how many pishwas are there in total and then divide it by two to get the number of pishwas that Somwari gets.  Now, let's count the number of pishwas. We know that there are 4 pishwas on Sunday, 3 pishwas on Monday, 2 pishwas on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday respectively. Therefore, the total number of pishwas is : 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15 pishwas.  Now, dividing it by 2 gives us the number of pishwas that Somwari gets : 15/2 = 7.5 pishwas. So, Somwari gets approximately 7.5 pishwas.
Response:  We know that Tifanny Reshikaal Karnaneyaasaa Thodi Dube Goolya Karat Hohti. So, some bags are carried by Tiffany. On Sunday, she carries 4 bags. Now, let's calculate how many bags Tiffany carries in total. If Tiffany carries 8 bags on Monday, then on Sunday, she carries 4/8 = 1/2 of the number of bags she carries on Monday. Therefore, Tiffany carries 1/2 x 8 = 4 bags on Sunday.
Response:  We know that 10 dogs barked at Somwari's house on Sunday and 3 dogs barked at Dusyanti's house on Monday. So, in total, 10 + 3 = 13 dogs barked. Therefore, there are 13 bags of dog food required to feed all these dogs.
Response:  On Sunday, there are 8 bags of rice (32 kg each). So, total weight of rice on Sunday = 8 x 32 kg = 256 kg. Now, let's calculate how much rice is left after Monday. If Somwari takes 4 bags of rice (12 kg each), then total weight of rice taken by Somwari = 4 x 12 kg = 48 kg. So, remaining weight of rice on Monday = Total weight of rice on Sunday - Weight of rice taken by Somwari = 256 kg - 48 kg = 208 kg.
Response:  We know that there are three fish in the first picture and four fish in the second picture. So, if we add these numbers together, we get: 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, there are seven fish in total.
Response:  We have two baskets of apples - one with 17 red apples and another with 16 green apples. How many green apples are there in the basket that has 17 red apples?  Therefore, the number of green apples in the second basket is 16 - 17 = -1 green apple. So, there is no green apple in the basket that has 17 red apples.
Response:  We have 5 red balls and 11 blue balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many red balls are there in each basket. From the given information, we know that -  There are 3 baskets. - In each basket, there are equal number of red and blue balls. So, if there are x red balls in one basket, then there will be x/3 red balls in each of the remaining two baskets. Therefore, the number of red balls in each basket is 3x/6.  Now, let's substitute this value in the equation given in the question: Number of red balls = 5 x (3x/6) = 5 x 3x/6 = 15x/6.  Since there are 11 blue balls in total, the number of blue balls in each basket is 11/3 = 3. So, the number of blue balls in each basket is 3.  Therefore, the ratio of red balls to blue balls in each basket is 15x/6 : 3 = 5 : 1.
Response:  We know that there are 15 balls in total and we want to find out how many of them are red. So, let's divide the number of red balls (red + pink) by the total number of balls:  Red + Pink = 15 Total Balls = 30 Therefore, the ratio of red balls to total balls is :  Red Balls : Total Balls = 15/30 = 5/6 or 5/8.
Response:  We have three red balls and ten white balls in total. So, there are 3 + 10 = 13 balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many white balls are there among the 13 balls. Since there are 10 white balls, so there are 3 white balls that are not among the 13 balls. Therefore, among the remaining 13 balls (i.e., 10 white balls + 3 red balls), there are 10 white balls.
Response:  We have 7 red balls, 15 blue balls, and 8 green balls in total. So, there are 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 balls in total. Therefore, among these 30 balls, there are 20 balls (i.e., 7 red + 15 blue + 8 green) that are not black.
Response:  We have 7 red balls and 71 white balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many white balls are there in 8 baskets. Since each basket contains an equal number of balls (red or white), we can assume that each basket has 8/7 = 1.143 balls (white). So, the number of white balls in 8 baskets is 1.143 x 8 = 9.052 white balls. Therefore, the ratio of white balls to red balls is 9.052 : 7 = 1.292.
Response:  We have two large baskets (6 and 14) and one small basket (3). So, we can fill the small basket with some items from either of the larger baskets. Now, let's assume that we filled the small basket with 5 items from the 6-basket. How many items are left in the 6-basket after removing those 5 items? There are 11 items left in the 6-basket. Similarly, how many items are left in the 14-basket after removing 5 items? There are 9 items left in the 14-basket. Therefore, there are 9 items left in both baskets after filling the small basket.
Response:  We have 19 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 12 green balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many red balls are there in the basket containing all these colors. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of red balls = Total number of balls - Number of blue balls - Number of green balls So, in this case, the total number of balls is 19 + 11 + 12 = 42 balls. Therefore, the number of red balls in the basket is 42 - 11 - 12 = 29 red balls.
Response:  We have 6 red balls and 90 white balls in total. Since there are 16 black balls, we can assume that each group of 4 black balls has 4/16 = 1/4 of all black balls. So, among the 6 red balls, 6 x (1/4) = 1 red ball is drawn from each group of 4 black balls. Therefore, out of the 6 red balls, 6 / 4 = 1 and 5 remain. Similarly, out of the 90 white balls, 90 / 4 = 22 and 68 remain. Thus, there are 1 red ball and 22 white balls left after drawing one ball from each group of 4 black balls.
Response:  We know that there are 18 large balls and 14 small balls in total. Since we have already counted 17 of them, then there must be one more ball left. So, the number of large balls is 18 - 1 = 17, and the number of small balls is 14 + 1 = 15. Therefore, there are 17 large balls and 15 small balls in the basket.
Response:  We have 5 red balls, 14 blue balls, and 6 green balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many red balls and blue balls are there in the basket. Since there are 6 green balls, none of them can be red or blue. So, among the remaining balls (red + blue), the number of red balls is equal to half of the total number of balls minus the number of blue balls. Therefore, the number of red balls = (5/2) - (14/2) = 3. Similarly, the number of blue balls = (14/2) - 6 = 8.
Response:  We have 65 balls in total and each basket has 7 red balls and 3 white balls. So, there are 65 x 7 = 455 red balls and 65 x 3 = 195 white balls. Now, we need to find out how many balls are in each basket. Since there are 12 baskets, the number of balls in each basket is 195 / 12 = 16. Therefore, each basket contains 16 balls.
Response:  We know that there are 11 baskets and each basket contains 10 apples and 18 pears. So, total number of apples = 10 x 11 = 110 apples. Total number of pears = 18 x 11 = 208 pears. Therefore, there are 110 apples and 208 pears in those 11 baskets.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 red balls and 18 white balls in each basket. So, the total number of balls in all baskets is:

16 x 5 = 80 red balls
18 x 5 = 90 white balls

Therefore, the total number of balls in all baskets is 80 + 90 = 170 balls."
Response:  We have 4 balls in total (3 red and 1 blue). Each ball has a diameter of 10 cm. So, the volume of each ball is: Volume = πr^2h Where r is the radius of the ball and h is its height. Since there are 4 balls, their total volume is: Total volume = 4 x Volume of one ball = 4 x πr^2h Now, we know that each red ball has a diameter of 5 cm, so its radius is half of that value: Radius of red ball = 5/2 = 2.5 cm Similarly, the blue ball has a diameter of 7 cm, so its radius is also half of that value: Radius of blue ball = 7/2 = 3.5 cm Now, let's find out how many cubic centimeters are inside each ball: Volume of red ball = π(2.5)^2h = 3.1416 x (2.5)^2 x h Cubic centimeters of red ball = 3.1416 x (2.5)^2 x h Cubic centimeters of blue ball = 3.1416 x (3.5)^2 x h Now, we want to know how many cubic centimeters are inside all four balls together. Therefore, we add up the volume of each ball: Total volume of all four balls = Volume of red ball + Volume of blue ball = 3.1416 x (2.5)^2 x h + 3.1416 x (3.5)^2 x h = 3.1416 x (5.5)^2 x h = 19.85 cubic centimeters Finally, since there are 4 balls in total, the number of cubic centimeters inside each ball is: Number of cubic centimeters inside each ball = Total volume of all four balls / 4 = 19.85 / 4 = 4.96 cubic centimeters So, there are approximately 4.96 cubic centimeters inside each of the 4 balls.
Response:  We have 4 red balls and 3 blue balls in each basket. So, we have a total of 12 balls (4 x 3 = 12). Now, we want to know how many balls are there in all the baskets together. Since there are 7 baskets, the total number of balls is 7 x 12 = 84. Therefore, there are 84 balls in all the baskets together.
Response:  We have two basket A and B. Each basket has 4 apples and 2 bananas. So, total number of fruits in both baskets is 12 (4 x 2 = 8 apples + 2 x 2 = 4 bananas). Therefore, there are 6 bananas in each basket (8/2 = 6).
Response:  We have 16 balls in total and we need to find out how many of them are red. From the given options, we can see that there are 13 red balls and 3 blue balls. So, the number of red balls is 13. Therefore, the answer is (D) 13.
Response:  We have 15 basckets of rice and we need to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 3-1/2 (or 3.5) basckets of rice.
"Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate the number of red balls among them. So, let's count the number of balls first:

Total number of balls = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100

Now, let's check how many red balls are there:

Number of red balls = 4 x 4 = 16

So, there are 16 red balls among the total of 100 balls."
Response:  We have 6 hirvi (monkeys), and each monkey has 60 pivles (fruits). So, in total, we have 6 x 60 = 360 fruits. Now, there are 2 large baskets among these fruits. So, out of 360 fruits, 2 baskets means 180 fruits left. Therefore, the number of fruits in each basket is 180/2 = 90 fruits per basket.
Response:  We have four options for each of the four questions in the puzzle. So, we have a total of 16 options to choose from. Now, let's see how many of these options can be used to fill up the blanks in the second sentence.  Option (A) cannot be used as it is already used in the first sentence. Options (B), (C), and (D) are not needed in the second sentence as they do not fit with any of the blank spaces. Therefore, out of the remaining 12 options, only option (E) can be used to fill up the blanks in the second sentence. So, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  If there are 7 actions that can be taken in a particular situation, and each action has 10 possible outcomes, then the total number of possible outcomes for those 7 actions is 7 x 10 = 70. So, if there are 10 actions that can be taken in general, and each action has 7 possible outcomes, then the total number of possible outcomes for all 10 actions is 7 x 10 = 70.
Response:  We have four questions and we need to find out how many answers are there in total.  For each question, we will consider six options as given in the question. So, for the first question, we have six options: A, B, C, D, E, F. For the second question, we have six options again: G, H, I, J, K, L. Therefore, the total number of answers is 6 x 4 = 24.
Response:  We have 5 questions in total and each question has 7 options to choose from. So, we have a total of 35 options (5 x 7 = 35). Now, let's assume that out of these 35 options, 9 are correct answers. Therefore, the probability of selecting a correct answer is 9/35 or 1/4.
Response:  We have two accounts with $10 each in one of them and $4 each in another account. So, the total amount in both accounts is : $10 + $4 = $14.
Response:  We know that there are 8 actions and 9 books. So, each book will have at least one action associated with it. Therefore, the total number of books with an action is at least 8 x 9 = 72. However, since some books may have more than one action associated with them, we cannot say exactly how many books have only one action. But certainly, among all the books, there are at most 10 books with only one action.
Response:  We have 7 questions in total and each question has 4 options to choose from. So, we have 7 x 4 = 28 options in total. Now, out of these 28 options, 4 are correct answers for the first 4 questions. Therefore, the number of correct answers for the first 4 questions is 4/28 = 1/7. Similarly, for the remaining 3 questions, there are 3 x 4 = 12 options, out of which only 1 option is correct. Therefore, the number of correct answers for the last 3 questions is 1/12 = 1/60. Thus, the final answer is (1/7) + (1/60) = 1/57.
Response:  We know that there are 5 actions and 2 books involved in the scenario. So, we have a total of 7 elements (actions + books). Now, let's consider each action separately. There are 9 shelves in each bookcase, so for each action, we have 9 possibilities. Therefore, the number of possible combinations is 7 x 9 = 63.
Response:  We have to find out how many action figures are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are from the set of 8 action figures that Jerry has given us.  So, let's count the number of action figures first. According to the question, there are 4 action figures in the set that Jerry gave us, which means there are 4 x 5 = 20 action figures in total (including the ones not given to Jerry). Now, we need to find out what percentage of these action figures belong to Jerry. To do this, we divide the number of action figures Jerry has (8) by the total number of action figures (20), which gives us a percentage of 8/20 or 40%. Therefore, Jerry has 40% of the total action figures.
Response:  We have three shells and four actions. So, we can make six combinations of actions with each shell. However, some of these combinations are not possible as they require more than one shell to perform an action. Therefore, the number of unique actions that can be performed using all three shells is five.
Response:  We have to find out how many action figures can be placed in each shelf of Jerry's collection. From the given information, we know that there are 7 shelves in total and each shelf can hold 10 action figures. So, the total number of action figures that can be placed in all 7 shelves is 7 x 10 = 70 action figures. Now, let's see how many action figures can be placed in each shelf. Since there are 8 action figures left after placing 70 action figures in the first 7 shelves, we can place 8 / 7 = 1.14 (approximately) action figures in each shelf. Therefore, the final answer is 70 action figures divided by 1.14 = approximately 62 action figures per shelf.
Response:  We have two shells with different shapes and sizes. One shell has 10 holes of equal size, while the other shell has 7 larger holes. If we join these two shells together, how many holes will there be in total?
Response:  We have 9 acquisition factors for Jeremy and we need to find out how many more acquisition factors he needs to reach 10 books. So, let's subtract the number of acquisition factors he already has (7) from the total number of acquisition factors needed (10). Therefore, Jeremy requires an additional 3 acquisition factors to reach 10 books.
"Response:  We have three books and four questions. Each book has two answers, so there are eight possible combinations of answers (3 x 4 = 8). However, we need to eliminate one combination since it is not possible for both books to contain the same answer. Therefore, there are seven possible combinations of answers (7):

1. Book 1: A, B; Book 2: C, D; Book 3: E, F
2. Book 1: A, C; Book 2: B, D; Book 3: E, F
3. Book 1: A, D; Book 2: B, E; Book 3: C, F
4. Book 1: A, E; Book 2: B, D; Book 3: C, F
5. Book 1: B, C; Book 2: A, D; Book 3: E, F
6. Book 1: B, D; Book 2: A, E; Book 3: C, F
7. Book 1: B, F; Book 2: A, E; Book 3: C, D"
Response:  We have 7 books and 3 action figures. When we combine them, we get 10 pairs. Now, among these 10 pairs, there are 2 action figures that match each book. So, the number of books that each action figure matches is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We have two birds, A and B, who can fly in opposite directions. There are six trees in total, labeled T1 to T6. Bird A flies from tree T1 to tree T2, then from tree T2 to tree T3, and so on until it reaches tree T6. Now, bird B flies from tree T1 to tree T4, then from tree T4 to tree T5, and finally from tree T5 to tree T6. So, how many times do we see both birds at the same tree? Solution:  To find out when both birds are at the same tree, we need to keep track of their movements. When bird A is at tree Tn (where n is an integer between 1 and 6), bird B cannot be at that tree because they are flying in opposite directions. Therefore, there are five possible combinations for the positions of bird A and bird B: 1. Tree T1 - Tree T2 2. Tree T2 - Tree T3 3. Tree T3 - Tree T4 4. Tree T4 - Tree T5 5. Tree T5 - Tree T6 Since each combination has a unique sequence of bird movements, there must be one pair of birds where we see them together at the same tree. For example, if we choose the combination 1 (Tree T1 - Tree T2), then bird A moves from tree T1 to tree T2 while bird B moves from tree T4 to tree T5, leaving us with only one possibility: bird A and bird B are together at tree T2. Thus, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that there are four birds that can fly in the air at one time. So, if we have five birds flying together, then some of them will have to fly in pairs or groups of two. Therefore, the maximum number of birds that can fly together is 4 x 2 = 8.
Response:  We have four birds and 46 grasshoppers. Each bird can carry one grasshopper at a time. So, in total, we need 4 x 46 = 184 trips to transport all the grasshoppers with the help of the four birds. Therefore, there are 184 grasshoppers that each bird can carry.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 2 dogs. If each bird lays 5 eggs, then we will have 15 eggs in total (3 birds x 5 eggs/bird = 15 eggs). Now, if each dog gives birth to 4 puppies, then we will have 8 puppies in total (2 dogs x 4 puppies/dog = 8 puppies). So, the total number of offspring we have is 15 + 8 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 creatures in total - 3 birds and 20 puppies.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 dogs. Two of the birds are sitting together. So, there are 2 birds left. Now, we need to find out how many birds are sitting together. Since two birds are already sitting together, there is only one bird left that can sit with another bird. Therefore, there is one bird sitting together with another bird. Hence, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have two birds and three eggs in one basket. If we put all three eggs in another basket, how many eggs will be left with each bird? So, there are 3 eggs in total. Now, if we divide these 3 eggs equally between the two birds, each bird will get 1 egg. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.
Response:  We have four birds and two dogs. The dogs can hold one bird each. So, we need to find out how many birds are left after the dogs pick up their respective birds.  There are 4 birds in total, and 2 dogs that can hold 2 birds each. Therefore, there will be no birds left after the dogs pick them up. Hence, the answer is 0.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 dogs. If we divide them equally among each other, then... (1 bird : 2 dogs) So, there are 3 birds and 8 dogs (4 x 2 = 8). Therefore, there are 5 animals in total - 3 birds and 8 dogs.
Response:  We have 6 birds and 3 dogs. Two dogs are left behind. So, we have 2 dogs + 6 birds = 8 living beings in total. Now, let's assume that each bird can carry one dog at a time. Since there are 8 living beings in total, each bird can carry 8/1 = 8 dogs. Therefore, all 6 birds can carry 6 x 8 = 48 dogs together.
Response:  We have four birds and three dogs. Each bird can carry one dog. So, total number of birds that can carry all the dogs = Total number of dogs / Number of birds per dog = 3 dogs / 1 bird = 3 birds. Therefore, there are 3 birds that can carry all the 3 dogs.
Response:  We have 6 birds and 4 dogs. So, there are 10 creatures in total (6 birds + 4 dogs). Now, we need to find out how many of them can fly. Among the birds, 3 can fly (the eagle, the hawk, and the falcon), so the number of flying creatures is 3. Similarly, among the dogs, none can fly, so the number of non-flying creatures is 4 (all dogs). Therefore, the final answer is 3 birds and 4 dogs that cannot fly.
Response:  We have two birds and four dogs. So, we can make 2 x 4 = 8 combinations of birds and dogs. Now, let's see which combination is possible based on the given information: 1. Bird - Dog Combination:  Two birds are sitting in one basket, so there are only three baskets left for the remaining four dogs. Therefore, the maximum number of bird-dog combinations that can be formed is 3 x 4 = 12. Hence, only 12 combinations are possible.
"Response:  We have three birds - A, B and C. They can fly in any of the four directions - north, south, east or west. Now, let's assume that bird A flies towards bird B, which is located at some distance x meters away from bird A. Similarly, bird B flies towards bird C, which is located at some distance y meters away from bird B. Since both birds are flying towards each other, we can say that the distance between bird A and bird C is equal to the sum of distances between bird A and bird B, and between bird B and bird C. Therefore, we can write the equation:
x + y = d (where d is the total distance between bird A and bird C)
Now, we know that the distance between bird A and bird B is 20 meters, and the distance between bird B and bird C is 15 meters. So, we can plug these values into the equation above:
x + y = 20 + 15 = 35 meters
Therefore, the distance between bird A and bird C is 35 meters."
Response:  We have 5 goats and 3 sheep. If we add them together, we get 8 animals in total. Now, if there are 4 pigs with them, then the total number of animals will be 12 (8 + 4). So, among these 12 animals, 7 are goats (5 + 2) and 5 are sheep (3 + 2). Therefore, out of the 4 pigs, 3 are male (since each male pig is equivalent to 2 female pigs) and 1 is female.
Response:  We have 6 goats and 2 pigs. If we divide them equally among 3 pens, then each pen will have 2 goats and 1 pig. So, there are 2 goats for every 1 pig in each pen. Therefore, the number of goats that can be accommodated in one pen is 2.
Response:  We have three birds - A, B and C. They can fly in any of the four directions - north, south, east or west. Now, let's assume that bird A flies towards bird B. There are two possible scenarios: (i) Bird A flies directly towards bird B, or (ii) Bird A flies obliquely towards bird B. In scenario (i), there is only one path for bird A to reach bird B, i.e., directly towards it. Therefore, the probability of bird A reaching bird B is 1/4. In scenario (ii), there are two paths for bird A to reach bird B - either directly or obliquely. So, the probability of bird A reaching bird B is 2/4 = 1/2. Similarly, we can calculate the probabilities of bird B flying towards bird A and bird C flying towards bird A. The final answer will be: Probability of bird A reaching bird B = 1/4 Probability of bird B reaching bird A = 1/2 Probability of bird C reaching bird A = 1/2 Since all these probabilities are equal, we can conclude that each bird has an equal chance of reaching any other bird.
Response:  In the first chapter, there are 48 pages. In the second chapter, there are 11 pages. To find out how many pages are between these two chapters, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. So, there are 37 pages between the two chapters.
Response:  In the first chapter, there are 37 pages. In the second chapter, there are 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:  Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter.
"Response:  We know that there are 93 pages in the book and we have already read 60 pages. So, the remaining pages to be read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Read pages
= 93 - 60
= 33

Therefore, there are 33 pages left to be read in the book."
"Response:  We know that there are 36 pages in the book and we want to find out how many pages have the word ""pahilya"" (first) in them. So, let's count the number of pages from chapter 1 to chapter 36. Chapter 1 has 20 pages, chapter 2 has 18 pages, chapter 3 has 24 pages, chapter 4 has 27 pages, chapter 5 has 30 pages, chapter 6 has 32 pages, chapter 7 has 34 pages, chapter 8 has 36 pages, and chapter 9 has 38 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages from chapter 1 to chapter 36 is: 20 + 18 + 24 + 27 + 30 + 32 + 34 + 36 = 258 pages. Since we want to find out how many pages have the word ""pahilya"", we need to subtract the number of pages from chapter 36 to chapter 1 from the total number of pages: 258 - 36 = 222 pages. Therefore, there are 222 pages in the book that contain the word ""pahilya""."
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages. So, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Chapter 1 has 66 pages, Chapter 2 has 35 pages, and Chapter 3 has 24 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. So, if we want to know how many pages are there between the two chapters, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. Therefore, the difference is: 91 - 23 = 68 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, the second chapter has 18 pages, and the third chapter has 3 pages. So, in total, there are 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 pages in the book.
Response:  In the first chapter, there are 53 pages. In the second chapter, there are 75 pages. And in the third chapter, there are 21 pages. So, the total number of pages is: 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. So, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1831 pages Therefore, there are 1831 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that there are 23 pages in the book and we want to find out how many pages have at least one word. So, let's start counting from page 10. Page 10 has 5 words, page 11 has 7 words, page 12 has 9 words, and so on. Therefore, there are 10 pages with at least one word.
Response:  We know that there are 81 pages in the book and we want to find out how many pages have 2 chapters each. So, let's divide 81 by 2 = 40.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a chapter, we round off the result to the nearest integer, which is 40 chapters. Therefore, there are 40 chapters in the book.
Response:  We know that 62 shibirarthi sakali udyay maaranyasathi gelay hote. This means that out of every 100 people, 62 will definitely get married. Now, we are told that 39 camper dupari roinglata geles. This means that out of every 100 marriages, 39 couples will have a child. So, to find out how many couples will not have a child, we need to subtract the number of couples who had a child from the total number of marriages. Therefore, the answer is: 39 - 62 = -23 couples will not have a child.
"Response:  We know that 52 crows can fit in one basket. So, if we want to find out how many baskets it would take to hold all the crows, we need to divide the total number of crows (61) by the number of crows that can fit in one basket (52). Therefore, the answer is: Number of baskets = Total number of crows / Number of crows per basket = 61 / 52 = 3 
So, it would take 3 baskets to hold all the 61 crows."
Response:  We know that there are 15 camps and each camp has 32 tents. So, in total, there are 15 x 32 = 480 tents. Now, we need to find out how many tents belong to Duparee. From the question, we know that Duparee has 7 tents. Therefore, the number of tents belonging to Duparee is 7. Finally, we subtract the number of tents belonging to Duparee from the total number of tents to get the remaining tents. The remaining tents are 480 - 7 = 473 tents.
Response:  We know that there are 7 shibirarthi and each of them has to give 60 kushtis. So, in total, we have 7 x 60 = 420 kushtis. Now, out of these 420 kushtis, some of them may be given by the same person twice or thrice. But since we are told that each person gives only once, so the number of unique kushtis given is 420 / 7 = 60. Therefore, 60 kushtis are given by different people.
Response:  We have 36 Shibirarthi and 13 Dupari. So, total number of pairs = 36 x 13 = 450. Now, we have 49 Shibiraarthi who are Sandhyakalli. So, remaining pairs = Total pairs - Number of Sandhya Kalli pairs = 450 - 49 = 401. Therefore, there are 401 camps where Kushti Sahitya is being taught.
Response:  We have 44 Shibirarthi and 39 Dupari. So, the total number of pairs is 44 x 39 = 1652. Now, we need to find out how many pairs are common between Shibirarthi and Dupari. From the given options, option (D) 31 Sandhyakalya has the highest number of pairs in common with both Shibirarthi and Dupari, which is 17 pairs. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 31 Sandhyakalya.
Response:  We have 53 Shibirarthi and 48 Dupari. So, total number of pairs = 53 x 48 = 2504. Now, we need to find out how many pairs are not possible. For that, let's consider each pair one by one. If two people are from different groups (Shibirarthi or Dupari), then they cannot be in a pair together. Therefore, the number of impossible pairs is equal to the total number of pairs minus the number of possible pairs. In this case, the number of possible pairs is 2504 - 167 = 2337. So, there are 2337 pairs possible among 53 Shibirarthi and 48 Dupari.
Response:  We have 33 Shibirarthi, 34 Shibirarthi dupari and 10 Sandhyakalli kustisathi gel. So, total number of Shibirarthi who got Kustisathi is 33 + 34 = 67. Now, out of these 67 Shibirarthi, how many got Kustisathi from Compassionate Grounds (Dupari)? Well, we know that 34 Shibirarthi are Dupari, so among them, 34 / 67 = 0.5 or half got Kustisathi from Compassionate Grounds. Therefore, the answer is 32.
"Response:  We know that 13 camels can carry 59 cubits of hay. So, we need to find out how many cubits each camel can carry.  Since there are 21 Shibirarthi duparis, they can also carry 59 cubits of hay. Therefore, the number of cubits each Shibirarthi can carry is:

$$ \frac{59}{21} = 2.86 $$

So, each Shibirarthi can carry approximately $2.86$ cubits of hay."
Response:  We know that 29 Shibirarthi went to hunt and came back empty-handed. So, they did not kill any deer.  Now, we have to find out how many Shibirarthi went hunting but could not return with their prey. From the given options, option (D) is the correct answer as it states that 66 Shibirarthi were able to hunt and bring back their prey. Therefore, the number of Shibirarthi who went hunting but could not return with their prey is 29 - 66 = -37.  Finally, we are asked to compare this negative number with the total number of Shibirarthi who went hunting, which is 105. So, the percentage of Shibirarthi who went hunting but could not return with their prey is (-37)/(105) x 100% = -34.8%.
Response:  We have 41 camels and 4 horses. Each horse can carry 5 people, so we have 4 x 5 = 20 passengers in total. Now, each camel can carry 3 people, so we have 41 / 3 = 13 passengers in total. Since there are 26 Shibirarthi duparis, they will be divided among the 13 camels, which means each camel will carry an average of 26 / 13 = 2 passengers. Therefore, 4 camels will not move and 4 will move with 2 passengers each.
Response:  We know that there are 46 camps and 43 Shibirarthi have been affected. So, the total number of people who have not been affected is 46 - 43 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these 3 people are duplicates. Since 2 people have died, the remaining 1 person must be a duplicate. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have to find out how many saffron threads are needed for each mountain.  If we need 4 saffron threads for one mountain, and there are 7 mountains in total, then we will need 28 saffron threads (4 x 7 = 28). So, there are 28 saffron threads on each mountain.
Response:  We know that there are four mountains and two valleys between them. So, we have a total of six paths to consider. Now, let's assume that Rahul took one path from each mountain to reach the next valley. Therefore, he took a total of 6 x 2 = 12 paths. Since he reached the last valley in 4 steps, it means that he covered 12 / 4 = 3 paths per step. Hence, Rahul took 3 x 4 = 12 paths to reach the last valley.
Response:  We have to find out how many more or less than 5 safar chand are required to fill up the remaining space of 3 paks and 2 aprak (unfilled) paks.  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of safar chand required for filling all the 5 paks = 5 x 4 = 20 safar chand. Now, we subtract the number of safar chand already filled = 20 - 5 = 15 safar chand. Therefore, there are 15 more safar chand required to fill up the remaining space of 3 paks and 2 aprak paks.
Response:  We have two mountains A and B with heights of 1080 m and 960 m respectively.  The distance between them is 7 km.  Now, we need to find out how many paces (of length x) it would take for one person to walk from mountain A to mountain B.  To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.  Since we know that the speed of a person walking is 500 m/h, we just need to find out how long it takes for one person to walk 7 km.  Therefore, the time taken to walk from mountain A to mountain B is: Time = Distance / Speed = 7 km / 500 m/h = 14 minutes.  So, if there are six people in total, each taking 14 minutes to walk from mountain A to mountain B, then the total time taken for all six people to make the journey will be: Total Time = 6 x 14 minutes = 84 minutes.
Response:  We have to find out how many safaris can be done in total and then calculate the number of safaris that can be done with each jeep.  Total number of safaris = Number of jeeps x Number of passengers per jeep Total number of safaris = 6 jeeps x 4 passengers/jeep = 24 safaris Now we know that there are 24 safaris in total. So, if there are 10 jeeps available, the number of safaris that can be done with each jeep is: Number of safaris per jeep = Total number of safaris / Number of jeeps = 24 / 10 = 2.4 safaris per jeep
Response:  We have three mountains with heights of 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet, and 8,000 feet respectively. If we start climbing from the base of the highest mountain (which is 20,000 feet high), it will take us 7 days to reach the top (since each day we climb 3,000 feet). Now, if we start climbing from the base of the second-highest mountain (which is 15,000 feet high), it will also take us 7 days to reach the top. However, since this mountain is lower than the first one, we can see half of its height (i.e., 7,500 feet) from the base. Therefore, the remaining distance to be covered in these 7 days is only 7,500 feet. Similarly, for the third mountain (which is 8,000 feet high), it will take us 6 days to reach the top (since each day we climb 1,333 feet). So, the total distance to be covered in these 6 days is 8,000 - 1,333 = 6,667 feet. Thus, the total distance that we cover during these 7 + 6 = 13 days is:  Distance = Total height of all mountains = 20,000 + 15,000 + 8,000 = 43,000 feet.
Response:  We have to find out how many steps it takes for Rahul to reach his destination from the starting point.  The distance between each step is given as 7 saffron-colored stones. So, in total, Rahul will take 7 x 2 = 14 steps to reach his destination. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  We have two mountains with four peaks each. So, in total we have 8 peaks. Now, three new mountains are formed and they have 4 peaks each. Therefore, the total number of peaks is now 12 (8 + 4). Since one mountain has already been destroyed, the final number of peaks left after destruction is 11 (12 - 1).
Response:  We have to find out how many saffron threads can be obtained from 52 pieces of sandalwood. Since each piece of sandalwood yields 1/4 saffron thread, we need to divide 52 by 4 to get the total number of saffron threads that can be obtained from all 52 pieces of sandalwood. Therefore, the answer is 13 (52 / 4 = 13).
Response:  We have three mountains with heights of 3000, 4000 and 5000 meters respectively.  If we want to know how many times each mountain can be climbed using 8 steps, we need to divide their heights by 8.  So, for the first mountain, we get: Height = 3000 m / 8 = 375 m per step. For the second mountain, we get: Height = 4000 m / 8 = 500 m per step. And for the third mountain, we get: Height = 5000 m / 8 = 625 m per step. Therefore, altogether all three mountains can be climbed 9 times (3 x 375 + 4 x 500 + 5 x 625)
Response:  We have four mountains and each mountain has seven peaks. So, in total we have 4 x 7 = 28 peaks. Now, we are asked how many gole (units) of stone it takes to build one peak. Since each peak requires 29 stones, we can calculate the number of gole required for building all 28 peaks as follows: Number of gole required = Total number of peaks x Number of stones per peak = 28 x 29 = 762 gole Therefore, Rahul needs 762 gole to build all the peaks.
Response:  We know that there are 19 more goats than dogs in the field. So, if there are x dogs in the field, then there are 19 + x goats in the field. Since there are 10 dogs and 19 more goats, we can write an equation as follows: 10 + (19x) = 39. Solving for x, we get: x = 29. Therefore, there are 29 goats in addition to the 10 dogs in the field.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gole (balls) in total and we have to find out how many bullets will be left after 45 shots. So, let's calculate it as follows: Total number of balls = 10 Number of shots = 45 Now, we need to subtract the number of balls used for each shot from the total number of balls. So, the number of bullets left after 45 shots can be calculated as: Bullets left = Total number of balls - (Number of balls used per shot x Number of shots taken) = 10 - (4 x 45) = 10 - 180 = -170 Therefore, there will be -170 bullets left after taking 45 shots.
Response:  We know that there are 6 goats in total and they can eat up to 7 maidans of grass. So, if each goat eats 2 bullets of grass (which is equal to 1/3 of a maidan), then how many bullets of grass will be left for the remaining 5 goats?  Therefore, the number of bullets of grass left after all 6 goats have eaten = Total number of bullets of grass - Number of bullets of grass eaten by 6 goats = 22 bullets - 6 x 2 = 4 bullets.
Response:  We know that there are 5 gole (bullets) in total and out of them, 3 gole are in the maidan area. So, the remaining 2 gole are outside the maidan area. Now, we have to find out how many bullets are outside the maidan area. Since each bullet has 27 holes, the number of holes outside the maidan area is equal to the number of bullets outside the maidan area multiplied by 27. Therefore, the answer is 2 x 27 = 54 holes outside the maidan area.
"Response:  We know that 24 - 9 = 15. So, there are 15 gole (units) left after 9 gole were taken away from the big pile. Now, we need to find out how many gole were in the big pile initially. From the question, we get: ""एडकडे डगपेक्षा २४ अधिक गोळे होते."" This means that there were 24 more gole than what was initially present in the small pile. Therefore, the total number of gole in the initial big pile is: 24 + 9 = 33 gole."
"Response:  We know that there are 29 goats in total and 17 of them are in the field. So, the remaining 12 goats must be in the barn. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 12"
Response:  We know that there are 19 bullets in total and we have to find out how many bullets will be left after 8 shots. So, let's calculate it as follows: Number of bullets remaining = Total number of bullets - Number of bullets fired (in 8 shots) Now, we know that 8 shots were fired, so we can substitute this value in the equation: Number of bullets remaining = 19 - 8 = 11 Therefore, there will be 11 bullets remaining after firing 8 shots.
Response:  We know that there are 30 bullets in each magazine and we have to find out how many magazines will be required for 91 bullets. So, we can start with dividing 91 bullets by 30 bullets per magazine: 91 / 30 = 3.067 magazines Now, since you cannot have a fraction of a magazine, we round off this value to the nearest whole number: 3 magazines Therefore, to fire 91 bullets, you would need 3 magazines.
Response:  We know that there are 12 bullets in each magazine and we have to find out how many magazines will be required for 30 rounds of ammunition. So, total number of bullets = 12 x 30 = 360 bullets. Now, if we divide the total number of bullets by the number of bullets in each magazine, we get: Number of magazines = Total number of bullets / Number of bullets in each magazine = 360 / 12 = 30 magazines. Therefore, there will be 30 magazines needed for 30 rounds of ammunition.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 408 students who have taken admission in engineering colleges through CAP round 1. Out of these, 325 students have got seats in their preferred college. So, the number of students who did not get seats in their preferred college is 83 (408 - 325). Therefore, the percentage of students who did not get seats in their preferred college is (83/408) x 100 = 20.6%.
Response:  If there are 479 students in total and 305 of them have taken the examination, then the number of students who did not take the examination is 174 (479 - 305). Now, among those 174 students, 128 have been absent from the examination hall (174 - 46), and among those 128 students, 84 have not received any information about the examination (128 - 46). Therefore, out of 479 students, 84 have not received any information about the examination.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 310 students who have taken admission in various courses offered by the college. Out of these, 185 students have opted for hostel accommodation. Now, let's assume that each student has been allotted a room with a bed and study table. This means that the total number of beds available in the hostel is 185 x 2 = 370. Since there are more than 310 students taking admission, some students will not get a bed. Therefore, the number of students who will not get a bed can be calculated as follows: Number of students who will not get a bed = Total number of beds available - Total number of students taking admission = 370 - 310 = 60. So, out of 310 students taking admission, 60 students will not get a bed.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who appeared for the examination in 1988. According to the given information, out of 288 students, 264 passed and 24 failed. So, the total number of students who appeared for the examination is: Total Number of Students = Passed + Failed = 264 + 24 = 288 Now, let's find out how many students got more than 70% marks. Out of the total number of students who appeared for the examination, 153 students scored above 70%. So, the number of students who got more than 70% marks can be calculated as follows: Number of Students with More Than 70% Marks = 153/288 x 100 = 53.33% Therefore, approximately 53.33% of the students who appeared for the examination in 1988 got more than 70% marks.
Response:  The number of students who took admission in engineering is 457 and out of them, 63 did not take admission in any branch. So, the percentage of students who did not take admission in any branch is (63/457) x 100 = 14%.
Response:  The number of students who took the exam is given as 182. Out of these, 166 passed the examination. So, the number of students who did not pass the examination is:  182 - 166 = 16  Therefore, 16 students did not pass the examination.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students who took the examination in each category - Science, Arts and Commerce.  For Science stream, there were 324 students, for Arts stream, there were 374 students, and for Commerce stream, there were 128 students.  Now, let's find out how many students got more than 60% marks in each category.  In Science stream, 59 students scored more than 60%, in Arts stream, 63 students scored more than 60%, and in Commerce stream, 28 students scored more than 60%.  Therefore, the percentage of students who got more than 60% marks in each category is as follows:  Science - 59/324 x 100 = 18.04%, Arts - 63/374 x 100 = 17.09%, and Commerce - 28/128 x 100 = 22.56%.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are three types of students - those who have taken admission for BAMS course (257), those who have taken admission for BUMS course (120), and those who have taken admission for BNYS course (97). Now, let's calculate the number of students who have taken admission for each course as per the given information:  For BAMS course, out of 257 students, 183 students have taken admission through CET (74%), while 74 students have taken admission through management quota (26%). So, the total number of students who have taken admission for BAMS course is 183 + 74 = 257.  Similarly, for BUMS course, out of 120 students, 80 students have taken admission through CET (66.67%), while 40 students have taken admission through management quota (33.33%). So, the total number of students who have taken admission for BUMS course is 80 + 40 = 120.  Finally, for BNYS course, out of 97 students, 63 students have taken admission through CET (65.26%), while 34 students have taken admission through management quota (35.12%). So, the total number of students who have taken admission for BNYS course is 63 + 34 = 97. Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, the total number of students who have taken admission for each course are:  BAMS - 257, BUMS - 120, and BNYS - 97.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are there in total. According to the question, there are 144 students in total. Now, let's find out how many of them have taken admission in science stream. According to the question, 467 students have taken admission in science stream, which is equal to 3 times the number of students who have taken admission in other streams (i.e., arts, commerce and management). Therefore, the number of students who have taken admission in other streams = 144 - 467 = -323. Now, let's find out how many of these students have taken admission in mathematics. According to the question, 79 students have taken admission in mathematics, which is equal to 50% of the number of students who have taken admission in other streams. Therefore, the number of students who have taken admission in other streams = -323 / 2 = -161. So, the final answer is: Number of students who have taken admission in science stream = 467; Number of students who have taken admission in other streams = -161; Number of students who have taken admission in mathematics = 79."
Response:  In 1928, there were 228 students who passed their SSC examination with first class distinction. Out of these, 337 students got admission in engineering colleges. Now, let's calculate the percentage of students who got admission in engineering colleges among those who passed their SSC examination with first class distinction. We can do this by dividing the number of students who got admission in engineering colleges (337) by the total number of students who passed their SSC examination with first class distinction (228). So, the percentage of students who got admission in engineering colleges is 337/228 = 0.146 or approximately 14.6%.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students who took the examination and got at least one wrong answer. According to the question, out of 450 students, 38 did not get any wrong answers, which means they got all questions correct. So, the remaining 412 students got at least one wrong answer. Now, let's find out how many students got exactly one wrong answer. Out of these 412 students, 27 got only one wrong answer, as mentioned in the question. Therefore, the number of students who got exactly one wrong answer is 27. Next, let's find out how many students got more than one wrong answer. Among the remaining 412 students, 38 did not get any wrong answers, and 27 got exactly one wrong answer. This means that 395 students got more than one wrong answer. Finally, let's add up the numbers to get the total number of students who gave incorrect answers: Total = 27 + 395 = 422. Hence, out of 450 students, 422 students gave incorrect answers.
Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in each category - those who got admission through CAP and those who didn't get admission through CAP.  For this, we need to analyze the data given in the question.  From the table, we can see that out of 218 students, 74 did not get admission through CAP, which means they got admission through other means like management quota or direct second-year admissions. So, the number of students who got admission through CAP is 218 - 74 = 144.  Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. Out of these 144 students, 35 were able to secure seats in their first choice of college. This means that the remaining 109 students did not get admission in their first choice of college. Therefore, the total number of students who did not get admission through CAP is 109.  Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of students who got admission through CAP. To do this, we divide the number of students who got admission through CAP (144) by the total number of students (218), and multiply it by 100. The result is 65%.
Response:  Firstly, out of 269 students who appeared for the examination, 330 were found to have cheated. This means that 101 students (330 - 269) did not cheat. Now, among those who did not cheat, 76 had Tomato juice in their bags. So, the number of students who had Tomato juice in their bags is 76 / 101 = 0.75 or approximately 3/4. Therefore, around 3/4 of the students who did not cheat had Tomato juice in their bags.
Response:  We have two numbers - 569 and 236. To find their product, we multiply them together: 569 x 236 = 130,744. So, the product of these two numbers is 130,744.
Response:  We have to find out how many mules are there in total and then compare it with the number of carts. So, let's calculate the total number of mules first. The given information is: Number of mules = 34 + 841 = 875 mules Now, we need to find out how many mules are there in each cart. From the question, we know that there are 841 mules in total, which means that each cart has approximately 9.62 mules (841/875). Therefore, the answer is 9.62.
Response:  We have 485 students in total and they are divided into two groups of 232 and 253 respectively. So, the number of students in the second group is 253 - 232 = 21.
"Response:  We know that there are 697 mules in total and each mule can carry 28 jasats (bags of rice). So, we need to calculate how many jasats one mule can carry based on the number of mules available.

Jasats carried per mule = Total number of jasats / Number of mules
= 697 / 10 (number of mules left)
= 69.7 jasats per mule

So, out of the remaining 10 mules, each mule can carry 69.7 jasats."
Response:  We have 635 mules and we want to know how many mule pairs are there. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of mules by 2, since each pair consists of two mules. So, 635 mules divided by 2 is equal to 317.5 mule pairs. Therefore, there are approximately 318 mule pairs.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and among them, 281 are girls. So, the number of boys is 868 - 281 = 587.
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in one school and out of them, 142 are from other schools. So, the number of students from that particular school is 700 - 142 = 558. Therefore, there are 558 students from that school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in total and 222 of them have passed. So, the number of students who have not passed is 706 - 222 = 484. Now, out of these 484 students, 418 are male students. Therefore, the number of female students who have not passed is 484 - 418 = 166.
Response:  We know that there are 902 muli in total and 811 of them have at least one child. So, the number of muli without any children is 902 - 811 = 131.
"Response:  We have:
Eka (1) shaleet = 632 muli
Cha (410) mulye = 2560 muli
Total number of muli in both = 632 + 2560 = 3208 muli
Now, we need to find out how many muli are there in each shaleet.
Let's divide total number of muli by number of shaleets:
Number of muli in each shaleet = Total number of muli / Number of shaleets
= 3208 / 410
= 7.79 muli per shaleet
So, there are approximately 7.79 muli in each shaleet."
Response:  We know that there are 732 muli and 761 mulye in total. Now, we need to find out how many muli are there in 682 muli. To do this, we can divide 682 by 732, which gives us approximately 0.94 or 94%. So, there are almost 94% of the total number of muli in 682 muli. Therefore, the answer is (almost) 656 muli.
Response:  We know that there are 135 mice in one cage and 214 mice in another cage. So, if we want to find out how many mice are in total, we need to add these two numbers together. Therefore, the total number of mice is: 135 + 214 = 349 mice.
"Response:  We have:

* Total number of students = 308
* Number of teachers = 36

Now, we need to find out how many students each teacher is responsible for. So, we divide the total number of students by the number of teachers:

Total number of students / Number of teachers =?
= 308 / 36 = 8

So, each teacher is responsible for 8 students."
Response:  We have to find out how many people are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are women. So, let's start with calculating the total number of people first. According to the question, there are 315 men and 309 women. Therefore, the total number of people is: Total = 315 + 309 = 624 Now, we need to find out what percentage of these people are women. To do this, we divide the number of women (309) by the total number of people (624): Percentage of women = 309 / 624 = 0.48 or 48% So, approximately 48% of the total population consists of women.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 739 is divisible by 402. To do this, we need to divide 739 by 402 and see if the result is an integer (i.e., whole number). So, 739 / 402 = 1.8156... (approximately). Since it is not an exact integer, we can round off the result to the nearest integer, which is 1. Therefore, there are approximately 1 x 402 = 402 mulies in 739 mulis.
"Response:  We know that there are 458 students in Mulye's class and out of them, 692 have passed. So, the number of students who have not passed is:

Number of students who have not passed = Total number of students - Number of students who have passed
= 458 - 692
= -234

Therefore, there are 234 students who have not passed in Mulye's class."
"Response:  We have 362 males and 257 females. If we take 403 males to enter the examination hall, then the number of remaining males is:

Males = 362 - 403 = 161

Now, the total number of males in the examination hall including those who entered earlier is:

Total Males = 161 + 362 = 523

Similarly, the number of females in the examination hall including those who entered earlier is:

Total Females = 257 + 257 = 514

So, the difference between the total number of males and females in the examination hall is:

Difference = Total Males - Total Females = 523 - 514 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 more females than males in the examination hall."
Response: 18 dollars is equal to 1600 rupees (as per current exchange rate). Now, if he spent 16 dollars, that means he has 1440 rupees left with him (1600 - 16 = 1440). So, there are 1440 rupees left with him.
Response:  Advertisement cost = $13. Now, let's calculate how much money is left after advertising. Money left = Original amount - Advertisement cost = $100 - $13 = $87. So, Edvard spent $87 on advertising.
Response:  Advertising cost $900. If he sold his product at a profit of $8, then he made a total revenue of $900 + $8 = $908. Now, if he spent $17 on other expenses, then he has $908 - $17 = $891 left after all expenses. So, Edvard spent $891 / $2 = $445.50 to advertise his product.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all 16 books. The price of each book is $92, so the total cost of all books is:

$92 x 16 = $1472

Now, we have to subtract the amount that Edward spent on books from the total cost of books. He spent $60 on books, so the remaining amount he spent is:

$1472 - $60 = $1412

Therefore, Edward spent $1412 on books."
Response:  We have two books with prices of $60 and $12 each. So, the total cost of both books is $60 + $12 = $72. Now, we need to find out how many dollars are there in 12 rupees. To do this, we divide the amount in rupees by the exchange rate (which is 1 USD = 80 INR). So, 12/80 = 0.15 or 15 paise. Therefore, each book costs 15 paise.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Edward spent on books and pens. According to the question, he spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, so the total amount he spent is $6 + $16 = $22. Now, we need to find out how much money Edward has left after buying these items. As per the question, he had $19 left initially, so the amount he has left now is $19 - $22 = -$3. Therefore, Edward has $3 less than what he initially had.
Response:  Advertising book cost $40 and pen cost $3. So, total cost of advertising book and pen is $40 + $3 = $43. Therefore, there is a difference of $12 between the actual cost and expected cost.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Edward spent on books and pens separately. According to the question, he spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So, Edward spent a total of $24 ($16 + $8) on these items. Now, we need to subtract the amount that he got back from the sale of his old books. He got $19 as change. So, the difference between what Edward spent and what he got back is $5 ($24 - $19). Therefore, Edward paid $5 for the pens.
Response:  Advertising cost $17 and you got back $10 from your friends. So, there is a loss of $7.
Response:  We know that 44 students in Class A did push-ups and Devyani did 58 more than them. So, the total number of push-ups done by all the students is: Total = 44 + (58 - 44) = 102 push-ups.
"Response:  We know that 51 jackets and 44 push-ups are given in the problem statement. Now, we need to find out how many more push-ups Devyani did than Jackie. So, let's subtract the number of push-ups given to Jackie from the total number of push-ups done by Devyani:

Devyani did 51 - 44 = 7 more push-ups than Jackie."
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups today and Jacharine did 9 more than him which means he did 53 push-ups in total. So, Jacharine did 53 + 9 = 62 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Devidne did 51 push-ups today in his gym class.  And we also know that Jacharipeksha did 49 more push-ups than Devidne. So, Jacharipeksha did 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Ajay can do 59 push-ups in one minute and 44 crunches. Devid did 19 more push-ups than Ajay. So, Devid could do 78 push-ups (59 + 19 = 78).
Response:  We have to find out how many more push-ups Devidne can do than Jacharine.  From the given information, we know that Devidne can do 44 push-ups in one minute and Jacharine can do 17 push-ups in one minute. So, the difference between them is 27 push-ups (44 - 17). Now, we need to convert this difference into minutes. To do this, we divide the difference by the number of push-ups done by Jacharine in one minute (17). This gives us 1.53 minutes (27 / 17). Therefore, Devidne can do 1.53 more minutes of push-ups than Jacharine.
"Response:  The number of push-ups and crunches performed by Ajay are given as follows:
Push-ups: 53
Crunches: 14
Now, we need to find out how many more push-ups Ajay did than Devdhenu. We know that Ajay did 53 push-ups while Devdhenu did 17 more push-ups (i.e., 17 + 53 = 69). Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Ajay and Devdhenu is 69 - 53 = 16. So, Ajay did 16 more push-ups than Devdhenu."
"Response:  We have to find out how many push-ups Ajay can do in one minute and then calculate the difference between his actual score and Devyani's expected score.

1. Firstly, we need to convert the time given in minutes into seconds. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

35 x 60 = 2100 seconds

2. Now, let's find out how many push-ups Ajay can do in 2100 seconds. According to the question, he did 35 push-ups in 30 seconds, which means he did 1.17 push-ups per second (35/30). Therefore, in 2100 seconds, he can do:

2100 x 1.17 = 2417 push-ups

3. Now, let's compare this with Devyani's expected score of 87 push-ups. As we know, she is faster than Ajay, so her actual score will be higher than his predicted score. To find out the exact number of push-ups Devyani can do, we need to divide her expected score by the time taken for each push-up:

87 / 30 = 29 push-ups per minute

Now, let's multiply the number of push-ups per minute by the total time taken (in seconds):

29 x 2100 = 59,900 push-ups

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, Devyani can do approximately 59,900 push-ups in one minute, while Ajay can only manage 2417 push-ups."
Response:  We know that there are 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in total. So, we have to find out how many crunches each person did. To do this, we need to divide the total number of crunches (58) by the number of people participating (10). Therefore, each person did approximately 5.8 crunches.
Response:  We know that 19 students in Class A did 39 extra push-ups and John did 13 more than Devyani. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 19 + 39 = 58 (extra push-ups done by Class A)  + 13 = 71 (extra push-ups done by John). Therefore, Devidhanne did 71 push-ups.
"Response:  The number of push-ups done by John is 51 less than the number of push-ups done by David. So, if David did 22 more push-ups than John, then John did x push-ups. We know that the difference between the number of push-ups done by John and David is 51, so we can write an equation:

x = 22 + 51

Solving for x, we get:

x = 73

So, John did 73 push-ups."
Response:  We know that 15 pups were born in the litter of Devon Rex cats. Out of these, 39% are male (6 x 15 = 90), and 61% are female (9 x 15 = 135). So, John has 135 female pups.
Response:  We know that Devindra has scored 30 more points than Jacharine in today's class. So, if Jacharine scored 37 points, then Devindra must have scored 67 points (30 + 37 = 67).
Response:  We know that Devid has scored 56 more points than Jacharpiya in today's game. So, if Jacharpiya scored 38 points, then Devid must have scored 94 points (56 + 38).
Response:  We know that 40 more push-ups were done today than yesterday (i.e., 17 - 34 = -17). So, if we subtract 17 from 62, we get -45. Therefore, Devidene did 45 fewer crunches than Jackie today.
Response:  We know that there are 36 more push-ups than crunches. So, if there were 58 push-ups and 33 crunches initially, then after doing 36 more push-ups, there would be 94 push-ups (58 + 36) and still 33 crunches. Therefore, Jackie did 61 push-ups (94 - 33).
Response:  We know that there are 27 push-ups in total and Dev has done 13 of them so far. Now we need to find out how many push-ups Dev will do if he continues at this rate for another 7 minutes. To calculate this, we can use the formula: Total number of push-ups = Rate x Time So, Total number of push-ups = (13/7) x 7 = 56 push-ups Therefore, Dev will do 56 push-ups in addition to the 13 he has already done, making it a total of 70 push-ups.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 5 appears in both sets of numbers given.  In set A, we have 5, 10, 15, and 20. In set B, we have 5, 10, 15, and 25. So, the number 5 appears twice in both sets. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have three numbers (3, 4, and 5) that can be multiplied to get a product of 12. Now, we need to find out how many more numbers are required to multiply to get a product of 100. So, we divide 100 by 12 to get 8. Therefore, there are eight numbers that can be multiplied together to give us a product of 100.
Response:  We have to find out how many of the remaining 7 questions can be answered with just one word.  Since there are only 5 words in the given list, we cannot use any of them to answer all 7 questions. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number of questions in each set is equal to or greater than 4.  For Set A, there are 5 questions, and for Set B, there are 6 questions. So, we need to calculate (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 questions that have at least 4 answers. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 8 can be divided into 3 parts without leaving any remainder.  So, we need to divide 8 by 3.  When we divide 8 by 3, we get 2 with no remainder.  Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many more words are required in the remaining 6 chapters of the textbook to make it complete.  Since there are 8 chapters in total, and we have already covered 2 chapters (Chapters 1 and 2), we have 6 remaining chapters.  Now, let's assume that each chapter requires an average of 500 words. Therefore, the total number of words required for all 6 chapters is: 6 x 500 = 3000 words.  So, if we add this amount to the total number of words already written in Chapters 1 and 2, we get: Total number of words = Number of words in Chapter 1 + Number of words in Chapter 2 + 3000 words (required for remaining 6 chapters) = 400 + 200 + 3000 = 3700 words.  Hence, there are 3700 words left to be written in the remaining 6 chapters of the textbook to make it complete.
Response:  We have three friends - A, B and C. They want to share their homework equally among themselves. The total number of questions in their homework is 100. Now, we need to find out how many questions each friend will get if they divide it equally among them. To do this, we can use division. So, we will divide 100 by 3, which gives us an answer of 33 questions per friend. Therefore, each friend will get 33 questions from the homework.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times we can divide 100 by 2, 3, and 4 respectively.  So, let's do that:

* Divide 100 by 2: 100 / 2 = 50 (we can do this exactly once)
* Divide 100 by 3: 100 / 3 = 33.33 (we can do this exactly once)
* Divide 100 by 4: 100 / 4 = 25 (we can do this exactly once)

So, in total, we can divide 100 by 2, 3, and 4 exactly once each. Therefore, the answer is 1."

So, the total number of questions is: 8 + 7 + 3 = 18
Therefore, the answer is 18."
Response:  We are given that Rahul has studied for 5 years and has scored 80% in mathematics.  We also know that he has studied physics for 3 years and has scored 70% in it.  Now, we need to find out how much time Rahul spent studying biology and chemistry together.  To do this, we can use the formula: Total Time = (Number of Years x Percentage Scored) / 2.  Using this formula, we get: Total Time = (5 x 80)/2 = 4 years. Therefore, Rahul spent 4 years studying biology and chemistry together.
"Response:  We have two options for the first puzzle - either we can choose to solve it using math or not use math at all. If we decide to use math, then we will need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the letters in each word so that they spell out the correct answers. For example, if we are solving the first puzzle and we want to find the number of ways to arrange the letters in ""homework"" so that they spell out ""h-o-m-e-w-o-r-k,"" there are five possible arrangements: H-O-M-E-W-O-R-K, H-O-M-E-W-O-R-K, H-O-M-E-W-O-R-K, H-O-M-E-W-O-R-K, and H-O-M-E-W-O-R-K. So, the total number of ways to solve the first puzzle using math is 5. Now, let's move on to the second puzzle. In this case, we have four options for arranging the letters in each word so that they spell out the correct answer. Therefore, the total number of ways to solve the second puzzle is also 4. Thus, the final answer is 9 (5 x 4)."
Response:  We are given that there are four options for Rahul's homework - math, science, English, and social studies.  Each of these subjects has seven questions, so we have a total of 28 questions.  However, we are also told that Rahul completed 19 of these questions, which means he did not complete 9 questions. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  Jackie has 6 emails and Dupree has 2 emails. To find out how many more emails Jackie has than Dupree, we need to subtract the number of emails Dupree has from the number of emails Jackie has. So, the difference between their email counts is: 6 - 2 = 4. Therefore, Jackie has 4 more emails than Dupree.
Response:  Jackie has 6 emails and Dupree has 8 emails. To find out how many more emails Dupree has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of emails Jackie has from the number of emails Dupree has. So, the difference between the number of emails Dupree has and the number of emails Jackie has is: 8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, Dupree has 2 more emails than Jackie.
Response:  Jackie sent 4 emails and her duplicate also sent some emails. So, in total, Jackie sent 5 emails (including duplicates).
Response:  Jackie sent 6 emails in total, and Duparee received 3 emails. So, Sandhya received 5 emails. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  Jackie sent 5 emails to Dupree and received 8 emails from him. So, the difference between the number of emails Jackie sent and the number of emails she received is:

5 - 8 = -3

Therefore, Jackie sent 3 more emails than Dupree received."
Response:  Jackie sent 4 emails to Dupree and 5 emails to Sandhya. So, in total, Jackie sent 9 emails (4 + 5).
Response:  Jackie sent 3 emails and Sandhya received 8 emails. So, the difference between the number of emails sent by Jackie and the number of emails received by Sandhya is:  3 - 8 = -5 emails. Therefore, Sandhya received 5 more emails than Jackie sent.
Response:  Jackie sent 10 emails to Dupari and received 7 emails in return. So, the number of emails that Jackie sent is 10 - 7 = 3 more than the number of emails that Dupari sent. Therefore, the number of emails that Jackie sent is 3 + 7 = 10 emails.
"Response:  If Jackie sent an email to her friend with the subject ""Hello"", then she must have received at least 7 emails from her friend in response.  Therefore, the number of emails that Jackie received is 7."
"Response:  We know that Jackie sent 10 emails and Sandhya received 5 emails. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Jackie sent x emails and Sandhya received y emails.  Since Jackie sent more emails than Sandhya received, we have: 
x > y  Now, we are asked to find out how many times Sandhya received emails for every email that Jackie sent. To do this, we divide the number of emails Sandhya received (y) by the number of emails Jackie sent (x): 
Sandhya received emails for every Jackie sent emails = y / x = 5/10 = 0.5 or half. Therefore, Sandhya received half as many emails as Jackie sent."
Response:  Jackie sent 6 emails and Deepa received 3 emails. So, in total, Jackie sent 6 + 3 = 9 emails.
"Response:  Jackie sent 3 emails and received 64 messages in one day. If we divide the number of emails she sent by the number of messages she received, we get:

Jackie sent 1 email for every 20 messages she received (3/64 = 1/20)."
Response:  We know that Jack sent 5 emails and received 6 replies. So, in total, he exchanged 11 messages (5 emails + 6 replies). Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  Jackie sent 10 emails and received 12 replies. So, the ratio of number of emails sent to number of replies is:  10/12 = 0.83 (approximately). Therefore, for every 10 emails that Jackie sends, she receives approximately 8.3 replies.
Response:  Jackie received 6 emails and wrote 8 letters. If we compare them, Jackie sent twice as many letters as she received emails. So, Jackie sent 2 x 8 = 16 letters.
Response:  Jackie sent 6 emails and received 91 replies. During that time, she also sent 2 more emails and received 74 replies. So, in total, Jackie sent 8 emails and received 165 replies.
Response:  Jackie sent 4 emails and received 6 emails in total. So, she sent twice as many emails as she received. Therefore, Jackie sent 8 emails (2 x 6 = 8).
Response:  Jack has 9 emails and he sent 7 of them to his friend. So, there are 2 remaining emails that Jack did not send to his friend. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Jackie has 3 emails and Sandhya has 16 emails. So, if we want to find out how many more emails Sandhya has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of emails Jackie has from the number of emails Sandhya has. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Sandhya has and the number of emails Jackie has is: 16 - 3 = 13. So, Sandhya has 13 more emails than Jackie.
Response:  Jackie sent three emails to Sarah and received one email from her in return. So, if Jackie sends 10 emails to Sarah, she will receive 3 emails in return (since Sarah only replied once). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of Tipu is equal to the length of Bedooka.  From the given information, we know that the length of Tipu is 9 inches and the length of Bedooka is 12 inches.  So, we need to divide the length of Bedooka by the length of Tipu: 12 inches / 9 inches = 1.33 times. Therefore, Tipu can cover 1.33 times the distance traveled by Bedooka.
Response: 31 inches = 2.5 feet (as there are 12 inches in one foot) So, Tipu is 2.5 feet tall and Beddook is 3.5 feet tall. Now, we need to find out how many times taller Beddook is than Tipu. We can do this by dividing the height of Beddook (in feet) by the height of Tipu (in feet): 3.5 ft / 2.5 ft = 1.4  Therefore, Beddook is 1.4 times taller than Tipu.
"Response:  We know that Tipu has 36 inches and Undy has 17 inches. So, if we calculate the difference between their heights, we get:
Tipu's height - Undy's height = 36 - 17 = 19 inches
So, Tipu is 19 inches taller than Undy."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total height of all three objects together. The height of Tipu is 25 inches, Bedook is 18 inches, and Undier is 20 inches. So, the total height of these three objects is: 25 + 18 + 20 = 63 inches. Now, we need to find out how much each object has risen above its original position. For Tipu, it rose by 25 - 17 = 8 inches; for Bedook, it rose by 18 - 14 = 4 inches; and for Undier, it rose by 20 - 16 = 4 inches. Therefore, the final height of each object after rising is: Tipu - 8 inches, Bedook - 4 inches, and Undier - 4 inches. Finally, we can see that Mausa rose by 63 - 59 = 4 inches."
Response:  We know that Tipu has 19 inches and Undy has 20 inches. So, if we compare their heights, Tipu is shorter than Undy by 1 inch. Now, let's calculate how much Undy will grow if he takes 10 steps of 1 inch each.  Undy will take 10 steps to grow 10 inches, which means he will grow by 10 inches. Therefore, Undy will be taller than Tipu by 10 inches after taking 10 steps.
Response:  We know that Tipu was 19 inches tall and Beddook was 39 inches tall. So, their height difference is 20 inches (39 - 19). Now, we need to find out how many times this height difference can be accommodated in one yard. There are 36 inches in one yard, so we can divide the height difference by 36 to get the number of yards required to accommodate it. Therefore, the distance between Tipu and Beddook is 5.55 yards (20 / 36).
Response:  We know that Tipu is 25 inches tall and Beddook is 32 inches tall. Undyre is shorter than both of them, so his height is less than or equal to 26 inches (since he is 26 inches shorter than Beddook). Now, we need to find out how many inches Tipu is taller than Undyre. Since Tipu is 25 inches tall and Undyre is at most 26 inches tall, Tipu is definitely taller than Undyre by at least 1 inch ( since 26 - 25 = 1). So, Tipu is 26 inches tall. Therefore, the correct answer is (T) 26 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total height of all three birds together. The height of Tipu is 24 inches, Bedduck's height is 33 inches, and Undier's height is 5 inches. Therefore, the total height of these three birds together is: 24 + 33 + 5 = 62 inches. Now, we need to find out how much higher Undier is than Tipu. Since Undier is 5 inches taller than Tipu, Undier will be 62 - 24 = 38 inches higher than Tipu.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the tip of the bed will touch the ground in one minute.  The length of the bed is 13 inches, and it moves at a speed of 2 inches per second. Therefore, the distance traveled by the tip of the bed in one second is 2 inches. Now, we need to find out how many seconds are there in one minute. There are 60 seconds in one minute. So, the total distance traveled by the tip of the bed in one minute is 60 x 2 = 120 inches. Since the height of the bed is 5 inches, the distance between the floor and the top of the bed is 5 inches. Therefore, the number of times the tip of the bed will touch the ground in one minute is 120 / 5 = 24.
Response:  We know that Tipu is 35 inches tall and Beddu is 4 inches shorter than him. So, Beddu's height is 31 inches (35 - 4). Now we are asked how many times taller Tipu is than Beddu. To find this out, we divide Tipu's height by Beddu's height: Tipu is 35 inches tall, and Beddu is 31 inches tall, so Tipu is 35 / 31 = 1.09 times taller than Beddu. Therefore, Tipu is 109% taller than Beddu.
Response:  We know that Tipu had 19 inches and Undyra had 4 inches more than him. So, Undyra's height is 23 inches (4 + 19). Now, we need to find out how much longer Undyra is than Tipu. To do this, we subtract Tipu's height from Undyra's height: 23 - 19 = 4 inches. Therefore, Undyra is 4 inches taller than Tipu.
"Response:  We know that Tipu is 39 inches tall and Undyra is 19 inches tall. So, we can calculate their difference in height as follows:
Tipu's height - Undyra's height = 39 - 19 = 20 inches
Now, we need to find out how many times Undyra's height is less than Tipu's height. To do this, we divide Undyra's height by Tipu's height:
Undyra's height / Tipu's height = 19 / 39 = 0.5
So, Undyra is half the height of Tipu. Therefore, Tipu is 60 inches (i.e., 39 x 2) taller than Undyra."
Response:  We know that Tipu has 21 inches of height and Beddoo has 25 inches of height. So, if we compare their heights, Tipu is shorter than Beddoo by 4 inches (25 - 21 = 4). Now, let's consider Undyra. Since he is taller than both Tipu and Beddoo, his height must be greater than or equal to their sum. Therefore, Undyra's height must be at least 21 + 25 = 46 inches. Hence, Undyra's height is 46 inches.
Response:  We have two quantities - 39 inches and 17 inches. To find out how many times the smaller quantity (17 inches) can be divided into the larger quantity (39 inches), we divide both numbers: 39 / 17 = 2.26. So, Tipu can jump 2.26 times higher than Beddook.
Response:  We know that टिपू (Tipu) is 9 inches tall and उंदीर (Undier) is 3 inches tall. So, if Tipu stands on Undier, his height will be reduced to 6 inches (9 - 3 = 6). Now, we need to find out how much Undier will be submerged in water. Since Undier is 3 inches tall and the water level is 5 inches above the ground, Undier will be completely submerged in water when the water level reaches 8 inches (5 + 3 = 8). Therefore, the final height of Tipu after standing on Undier will be 6 inches - 8 inches = -2 inches. So, Tipu will sink into the ground by 2 inches.
Response:  We know that Tipu has 14 inches and Undy has 16 inches. So, if we compare their heights, Tipu is shorter than Undy by 2 inches (16 - 14 = 2). Now, let's consider Bedoo's height. He has 37 inches, which is more than both Tipu and Undy combined (37 > 14 + 16). Therefore, Bedoo is taller than both Tipu and Undy.
Response:  Meri ke kek bana vat ahe. (My key is broken)  Kriiti madhye 14 kapa maida ahe. (There are 14 keys in total) 6 saakhare ahe. (There are 6 locks) Adhichi 5 kapa maida ahe. (There are 5 remaining keys) Now, let's calculate how many more keys are required to open all the locks. Total number of locks = 6 Locks per key = 14 Keys needed to open all locks = 6 x 14 = 84 Therefore, there are 84 additional keys required to open all the locks.
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my key (or cake) has been baked.  Reshmi madhyen 9 kap maida ahe and 11 saakhare ahe. That means there are 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar available. Now, adhichi 4 Kap maida ghatla ahe means there are 4 cups of flour left. So, now we have to find out how many cups of sugar will be required to make 4 cups of flour. Therefore, the answer is 11/4 = 2.75 cups of sugar will be required to make 4 cups of flour.
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my key is broken into two parts.  There are 6 cups of water in one part and 13 cups of milk in another part. You want to know how many cups of water I have left after adding 8 cups of milk to the other part. So, let's calculate it.  If there were 6 cups of water in one part and you added 8 cups of milk, then there would be 6 + 8 = 14 cups of liquid in that part now. Since there are 13 cups of milk in the other part, if we add them to the first part, there will be 14 + 13 = 27 cups of liquid in total. Now, since you asked me how many cups of water I have left after adding 8 cups of milk, we need to subtract the number of cups of milk from the total number of cups of liquid. Therefore, the answer is 27 - 8 = 19 cups of water left.
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my cake has been baked.  There are 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar in the recipe. Now, you want to know how many cups of water I have used. Based on the information provided, I have used 2 cups of water. So, now we need to calculate how much water is left after using 2 cups. We can do this by subtracting 2 cups from 11 cups (flour) and getting 9 cups remaining. Similarly, we can subtract 7 cups of sugar from 11 cups and get 4 cups remaining. Therefore, there are 4 cups of water left after using 2 cups.
Response:  Meri keek banavat ahe means my cake is baked.  Resepimadhye 11 cup sugar and 3 cups of flour are required. But you have only 2 cups of flour left. So, how many cups of flour do I need to buy?  We know that 1 cup of flour makes 1/4 of the total quantity of the recipe, so we can calculate the remaining amount of flour needed as follows: Total quantity of flour required = 11 cups Sugar + Flour = 3 cups Flour Remaining amount of flour = Total quantity - Available amount = 8 cups (since you have 2 cups left) Therefore, you need 8 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my key is broken.  Reshmi has given me 12 cups of water and 5 cups of milk. Now I have to calculate how much water I have left.  From the problem statement, we know that Tilak has given me 2 cups of water. So now my total water amount is: 12 - 2 = 10 cups of water left.  Similarly, from the problem statement, we know that Ramesh has given me 3 cups of milk. So now my total milk amount is: 5 + 3 = 8 cups of milk left.
"Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means ""My key is broken"". So, we have 9 cups of water and 5 cups of sugar. We need to find out how much tea we can make with these quantities.  Adhichi 3 cups of milk and 62 cups of water are available. Now, let's calculate how much tea we can make using these ingredients.  To make one cup of tea, we need 1/4th cup of tea leaves (as per the given ratio). Therefore, to make 3 cups of tea, we will need 3 x 1/4 = 7/4 cups of tea leaves. Similarly, to make 62 cups of tea, we will need 62 x 7/4 = 49 3/4 cups of tea leaves.  Since we don't have an exact number like 49 3/4 cups of tea leaves, we can round it off to the nearest whole number, which is 50 cups of tea leaves. Therefore, we can make approximately 50 cups of tea using the given ingredients."
"Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means ""My key is broken"".  Kriiti madhye 5 kap maida ahe and 14 saakhars ahe. Tine adhichi 10 kap maida ahe and 2 saakhars takali ahe. So, the total number of keys that can be made from the given quantity of metal is:  Total number of keys = (Total amount of metal available for making keys) / (Number of keys required to make one key) = (5 + 14) / 2 = 19 keys. Therefore, there will be 19 keys made from the given quantity of metal."
"Response:  We have:
Merī kek banawat āhe. (My key is broken.)
Ya resipiemadhye 12 kap maida, 5 kap saakhara, and 49 kap mīthā are available. (There are 12 cups of rice, 5 cups of lentils, and 49 cups of milk available.)
Tinē 11 kap maida adhich āghatlā āhe. (You have taken 11 cups of rice.)
Tilā ānakhi kitī kap maida ghālatā laagēla. (The amount of rice you took is not equal to the amount of milk.)
So, the numeric answer is: 11 - 49 = -38"
Response:  Meri ke kek bana vat ahe. (My key is broken) So we have 10 cups of water and need to fill it up to 80 cups. We have 2 cups of milk and 80-2=78 cups of water left. Now, how many more cups of water can we add to make it 80 cups? Therefore, the answer is 78/2 = 39 cups.
Response:  We have 12 cups of water and we want to make 14 cups of tea. So, we need 2 more cups of water for making tea. Now, we have 7 cups of milk left, which is enough to make 7/5 = 1.4 cups of tea with 1 cup of milk. Therefore, we can make 14 - 1 = 13 cups of tea with the given amount of water and milk.
Response:  Meri keka (my key) has 6 keys, each of which can be used to unlock one door. There are 8 doors in total that need to be unlocked. So, we need 8 x 6 = 48 keys to unlock all the doors. However, there are only 5 keys available with me, so we cannot unlock all the doors using just these 5 keys. Therefore, the remaining 43 keys needed to unlock all the doors are not available with me.
"Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means ""My cake is baked"".  Resepimadhye 12 kap maida ahe and 13 kap saakhar ahe. Tine adhich 2 kap saakhar takali ahe. So, til aju kiitki kitni cap saakhar ghalelavi lagel.  We can conclude that there are 6 cups of sugar in total (12 + 13 - 2 = 6)."
"Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means ""My key is broken"".  Resipiemadhye 9 kap maida ahe and 6 kap saakhare ahe. Tine adhichi 4 kap saakhare takali ahe. Aata tila sakhre cha kappekshya kitii kap adhik pithachi garj ahe?  Now let's analyze the information given in the question:  * Meri ke kek banwat ahe (My key is broken) implies that there are only 2 keys left.  * Resipiemadhye 9 kap maida ahe (There are 9 keys more than me) means that there are 9 additional keys available.  * 6 kap saakhare ahe (There are 6 keys less than me) indicates that there are 6 fewer keys available compared to the total number of keys.  * Tine adhichi 4 kap saakhare takali ahe (I have taken 4 keys) shows that you have taken 4 keys from the total available.  So, now we need to find out how many keys are left after taking 4 keys. To do this, we will subtract the number of keys you took (4) from the total number of keys available (9): 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 keys left after taking 4 keys. Finally, we need to check if the remaining keys are enough for the task at hand:  Are 5 keys enough to open all the locks? The answer is no, as there are only 5 keys left, and the problem statement mentions that there are 7 locks in total. Hence, the answer is B - There are not enough keys to open all the locks."
"Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means ""My cake is baked"".  Reshamimadhye 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour are required. You have half of that amount (3 cups of sugar and 5 cups of flour). How many more cups of sugar do you need to make another batch of cake equal in size to the first one?"
Response:  Meri ke kek banaavat aahes means my sugar level has increased to 50 ml/100 ml of blood (5%). And out of that, 14% is maida (wheat flour). So, the remaining amount after deducting 14% is 86%. Now, we need to find out how much water will be required to dilute 86% of sugar in 11 cups of water. To do this, we can use the formula: Water Required = (Weight of Sugar / Weight of Solution) x 100 Where weight of sugar is equal to 86% of total weight and weight of solution is equal to 1 cup of water multiplied by the number of cups of water used. In this case, the weight of sugar is 86% of 11 cups = 9.36 cups (approximately). So, the water required to dilute 9.36 cups of sugar to 1 cup of solution is: Water Required = (9.36 / 1) x 100 = 936 ml Approximately.
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my key is broken into three parts.  Reshmi has 3 cups of water and 10 cups of milk. Now, we need to find out how many cups of water are left after pouring some milk from Reshmi's container into mine.  So, let's assume that I have taken 2 cups of water from Reshmi's container and poured it into mine. Now, let's see how much water is left in Reshmi's container.  Reshmi has 3 cups of water initially, and she gave me 2 cups of water. So, now there are 3 - 2 = 1 cup of water left in Reshmi's container.  Therefore, the answer is 1 cup.
Response:  We have 5 cups of water and 13 cups of milk. So, we can make 8 cups (5 + 13) of liquid mixture. Now, we need to subtract the amount of liquid that is already boiled (12 cups). Therefore, the remaining amount of liquid that needs to be boiled is 8 - 12 = -4 cups. Since it cannot be negative, there are no more liquids left to boil.
Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means my sugar level is high.  Kriiti madhye 60 ml and maidda 140 ml are present. There are 75 ml of water in addition to these two liquids. So, the total amount of liquid is 75 + 60 + 140 = 375 ml. Now, we need to calculate how much sugar is required to make 75 ml of solution with a concentration of 60%. To do this, we will use the formula: Concentration (in percentage) x Total volume (in ml) = Amount of solute (in grams) / 100. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: 60% x 75 ml = 45 g / 100 = 0.45 g. Therefore, 0.45 grams of sugar are needed to prepare 75 ml of solution with a concentration of 60%.
Response:  We have 11 cups of water and 9 cups of milk. So, in total we have 20 cups (11 + 9 = 20). Now, we need to find out how many cups of tea can be made with this amount of liquid. As per the recipe, for every 1 cup of water, we need 1/3 cup of tea leaves. Therefore, to make 12 cups of tea, we will require 4 cups of tea leaves (12 x 1/3 = 4). Since we already have 11 cups of water, we cannot make more than 11 cups of tea. So, the remaining 1 cup of water can only make 1 cup of tea. Hence, the answer is 11 cups of tea.
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my sugar level has gone up. So, I have consumed more sugar than usual. Now, let's see how much sugar I have consumed based on the recipe given in the question. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of water. So, if we assume that each cup of sugar contains approximately 200 calories (which is a rough estimate), then the total number of calories from sugar in this recipe would be: Sugar calories = 3 x 200 = 600 calories. Now, let's calculate how many teaspoons of sugar are present in this recipe. We know that there are 15 teaspoons of sugar in every cup of sugar, so the total number of teaspoons of sugar in this recipe would be: Teaspoons of sugar = 600 / 15 = 40 teaspoons. Finally, to determine how many teaspoons of sugar you have consumed based on your statement that you have eaten half of the recipe, we need to divide the total number of teaspoons of sugar by 2: Number of teaspoons of sugar consumed = 40 / 2 = 20 teaspoons. Therefore, you have consumed 20 teaspoons of sugar based on the recipe provided in the question.
Response:  Meri keek banaavat aahes means my sugar is increasing. So, there are two parts to this problem - the amount of sugar in the mixture and the number of cups required for each part.  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar in 14 cups of water, so we can calculate the ratio of sugar to water as follows: Sugar : Water = 9 : 14 or 3 : 5. Now, let's find out how much more water is needed to make 40 cups of mixture with 3 cups of sugar. To do this, we need to divide 40 by 3 (the number of cups of sugar) and multiply it by 5 (the number of cups of water): Number of cups of water needed = 40 / 3 x 5 = 20 cups Therefore, an additional 20 cups of water are needed to make 40 cups of mixture with 3 cups of sugar.
Response:  We have 9 cups of water and want to make 12 cups of milk. So, we need 3 more cups of water. Now, we have 7 cups of milk left after making 12 cups of milk from 9 cups of water. Therefore, if we add another 4 cups of water to the remaining 7 cups of milk, it will result in 11 cups of milk (since 4 + 7 = 11).
Response:  Meri keek banvata ahe means my cake is baked.  Reshmi has 11 cups of flour and wants to make 6 cups of cake mixture and 9 cups of frosting. She also has 12 cups of sugar. To calculate how much cake mixture she will have after adding the sugar, we can use the following formula: Cake mixture = Flour x Sugar / 3 (as per the recipe). So, Cake mixture = 11 x 9 / 3 = 33 cups of cake mixture. Now, let's find out how much frosting she will have after adding the sugar: Frosting = Cake mixture x Frosted ratio (which is 75% in this case) So, Frosting = 33 x 0.75 = 24.25 cups of frosting. Finally, let's check if there is enough frosting for all the cakes: Total amount of frosting needed = Number of cakes x Amount of frosting required per cake (which is 6 cups in this case) Total amount of frosting needed = 6 x 24.25 = 141.5 cups of frosting. Since Reshmi has only 9 cups of frosting, it is not enough to cover all the cakes. Therefore, the answer is Yes, Reshmi does not have enough frosting to cover all the cakes.
Response:  Meri keek banavat ahe means my key (or cake) is baked.  Reshamimadhye 7 kup saakhar ahe means there are 7 cups of sugar in it. And maidda ahe means there are 10 cups of water in it. So, total amount of liquid ingredients = 7 + 10 = 17 cups. Now, adhichi 4 kup saakhar takali ahe means there are 4 cups of flour used to make the cake. So, total weight of dry ingredients = 4 cups x 125 grams/cup = 500 grams. Now, let's calculate the volume of the cake: Volume of cake = Total amount of liquid ingredients / Density of the mixture (which we don't know yet). Since we have 17 cups of liquid ingredients and 500 grams of dry ingredients, the density of the mixture would be approximately 17 / 500 = 0.034 cubic meters (approximately). Now, since the height of the cake is given as 8 cm, we can use the formula for volume of a rectangular prism to find its length and breadth: Length = Height x Width = 8 cm x Breadth =? Breadth = Volume of cake / Height x Width = 0.034 cubic meters / 8 cm x? =? cm. Therefore, the width of the cake is approximately 3.6 cm.
"Response:  Meri ke kek banwat ahe means ""My cake is baked"".  Reshamimadhye 12 cup sugar and 14 cups of flour are required for making the cake. You have taken 10 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. So, you still need 2 cups of sugar and 2 cups of flour to make the cake completely. Now, let's calculate how much more sugar and flour are needed based on the ratio given in the question. Ratio of sugar to flour is 1:1.5, which means that for every 1 cup of sugar, we need 1.5 cups of flour. Therefore, if we need 2 cups of sugar more, it means we need 3 cups of flour (2 x 1.5 = 3). So, you still need 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  If there are 19 species of birds in each tree and if we have 60 trees, then the total number of bird species will be:  19 x 60 = 1140. So, there are 1140 different bird species that can be found in the forest.
Response:  We know that there are 87 species of birds in the forest and each bird species has its own nesting site. So, if we want to calculate how many nests each bird species can make, we need to divide the total number of bird species (87) by the number of nesting sites available (7). Therefore, each bird species can make approximately 12.14 nests per nesting site.
Response:  We know that there are 20 species of birds in the forest and 14 of them migrate to other places during winter. So, out of these 20 species, only 6 (i.e., 6/20) migrate to other places for shelter. Therefore, the number of bird species that do not migrate to other places for shelter is 14 - 6 = 8.
Response:  We know that there are 85 species of birds in the forest and 23 of them migrate to Africa while 37 remain in India during winter. So, the number of bird species that migrate to Africa is 23.
Response:  We know that there are 8 species of birds in the forest and they have been divided into four categories - African, Asian, European, and others.  Out of these, 42 birds belong to Africa, 31 birds belong to Asia, and 8 birds belong to Europe. So, among the remaining 50% (which is equal to 42 + 31 = 73), 31 birds belong to other regions. Therefore, out of the total 80 birds, 31 birds belong to other regions.
Response:  We know that there are 38 species of birds in the doongerwala area and 47 species have been recorded in Africa. So, if we assume that all the bird species found in Africa are also present in the doongerwala area, then the number of bird species in the doongerwala area would be:  Number of bird species in Doongerwala = Number of bird species in Africa + Number of bird species unique to Doongerwala Area  Therefore, the number of bird species in the doongerwala area is:  Number of bird species in Doongerwala = 47 + 38 = 85  Hence, there are 85 different species of birds in the doongerwala area.
Response:  We know that there are 18 species of birds in the dongar (desert) and they migrate to Africa for wintering. So, if 38 birds migrated from India to Africa, then how many birds remained in India? Well, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of birds = Number of birds in India + Number of birds in Africa Total number of birds = 18 + 38 = 56 Now, let's find out how many birds remained in India after migration: Remaining birds in India = Total number of birds - Number of birds that migrated to Africa Remaining birds in India = 56 - 38 = 18 Therefore, there are 18 species of birds remaining in India after migration to Africa.
Response:  According to the question, there are 87 species of birds in Dongaraha. If we take away 18 new species that have recently arrived at Dongaraha, then how many bird species will be left in Dongaraha? Therefore, the number of bird species left in Dongaraha is 69 (87 - 18).
Response:  We know that there are 49 bird species in the forest and 59 of them have their nests in the trees. So, out of these 49 birds, 10 (i.e., 49 x 10/59) have their nests in the remaining 24 new tree species. Therefore, the number of bird species with their nests in the remaining 24 new tree species is 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 species of birds in the forest and each bird lays an average of 3 eggs per clutch. So, the total number of eggs laid by all the birds in the forest is:

27 x 3 = 81 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many eggs hatch successfully. According to the question, only 41% of the eggs hatch successfully. Therefore, the number of eggs that hatch successfully is:

81 x 0.41 = 33 eggs

So, out of 81 eggs, only 33 eggs hatch successfully in the forest."
Response:  We know that there are 86 species of birds in the forest and 45 of them have their nests in the trees. So, if we want to find out how many bird species have their nests in each tree, we need to divide the number of bird species by the number of trees (i.e., 45). Therefore, the ratio of bird species having their nests in each tree is:  Number of bird species per tree = 86 / 45 = 1.9  Hence, approximately 1.9 bird species have their nests in each tree in the forest.
Response:  We know that there are 41 species of birds in the forest and they have 35 nesting sites. So, each bird has an average of 1.17 (35/41) nesting sites per species. Now, we need to find out how many African pigeons (which have 62 nesting sites) are present in the forest. Since each bird can have at most one African pigeon nesting site, the number of African pigeons is equal to the total number of nesting sites minus the number of nesting sites occupied by other birds. Therefore, the number of African pigeons in the forest is: Number of African pigeons = Total number of nesting sites - Number of nesting sites occupied by other birds = 62 - (35 x 1.17) = 62 - 40.85 = 21.15 So, there are approximately 21 African pigeons in the forest.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 species of birds in Dongaraha - 1) Indian Roller (Coracias benghalensis), 2) Red-wattled Lapwing (Vanellus indicus), and 3) Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis).  Now, let's analyze the information given in the question:  * ""हिवाळा जवळ आला आहे"" means that there are 50 pairs of birds in Dongaraha.  * ""आहे आणि बहुतेक प्राणी उबदार देशांमध्ये स्थलांतर करत आहेत"" means that among these 50 pairs, 26 pairs are of new species, i.e., those which were not present earlier in Dongaraha.  * ""डोंगराच्या जवळ 3 पक्षी कुटुंबे राहतात"" means that out of the total 30 pairs of birds in Dongaraha, 3 pairs are of Indian Rollers, 2 pairs are of Red-wattled Lapwings, and 1 pair is of Common Mynas.  Therefore, we can conclude that there are 47 pairs of birds in Dongaraha, excluding the 3 pairs of Indian Rollers, Red-wattled Lapwings, and Common Mynas. So, the answer to your question is 47."
"Response:  We know that there are 253 boxes in total and each box contains 70 books. So, the total number of books is:

253 boxes x 70 books/box = 17,910 books
Now, we need to find out how many colors are present among those 17,910 books. The question states that ""yesterday's color"" means the color of the book cover, so let's count the number of different colors among the covers:

We can see from the picture that there are 7 different colors of book covers: blue, green, orange, purple, red, yellow, and white. Therefore, the number of colors among the 17,910 books is:

7 colors x 17,910 books = 123,870 colors
So, there are 123,870 different colors among the 17,910 books."
Response:  We know that there are 551 pages in the book and it has 30 chapters. Since each chapter has approximately 18-20 pages, we can estimate the total number of words in the book to be around 551 x 30 = 16,530 words. Now, let's assume that each word has an average length of 4 letters (which is a rough estimate). So, the total number of letters in the book would be 16,530 x 4 = 66,120 letters. Finally, if we divide this number by 26 (as there are 26 alphabets in the English language), we get an approximate count of 2,579 characters per page.
Response:  We have a box of 440 pens and we want to divide it equally among 11 friends such that each friend gets an equal number of pens. So, the total number of pens each friend will get is:  Number of pens = Total number of pens / Number of friends = 440 / 11 = 40 pens per friend. Now, let's find out how many different ways this can be done:  There are 106 ways to distribute 40 pens among 11 people (ignoring order). Therefore, there are 106 ways to divide the box of 440 pens equally among 11 friends.
Response:  We have 65 boxes of apples and we want to pack them into 213 pens. Each pen can hold either 16 or 8 apples. So, how many pens will each box fill? Well, if we divide the total number of apples (65) by the capacity of each pen (16), we get 4 pens per box. If we divide again by 2 (since there are two types of pens), we get 2 pens per box that can hold 16 apples each. Now, let's count how many pens we need for all those apples: 65 apples / 16 apples per pen = 4 pens per box x 4 boxes = 16 pens Total number of pens needed = 16 pens. Therefore, 16 pens will be filled with 16 apples each, while 4 pens will be filled with 8 apples each.
Response:  We know that Polla is 58 years old and has 571 pens in his box. He gave away all of them to his friends except for 161 pens which he kept for himself. So, the number of pens given away by Polla is 571 - 161 = 410 pens.
Response:  We have to find out how many pens Polla has given to his friends among the total of 110 pens he had.  From the question, we know that Polla gave away 90 pens to his friends and kept 41 pens for himself. So, the number of pens Polla gave to his friends is 90.
Response:  We know that in one year, there are 563 days and 558 days have passed since Polla started working at his current company. So, if we calculate the number of days between the two dates given in the question, we get: Days between 2019-01-01 and 2022-01-01 = 558 + 332 = 890 days Now, let's convert this number to years: Years between 2019-01-01 and 2022-01-01 = 890 / 365 = 2.47 years Therefore, Polla has worked for approximately 2 years and 4 months (or 2.47 years) at his current company as of January 2022.
Response:  We know that in one year, there are 52 weeks and each week has 7 days. So, in total, there are 52 x 7 = 364 days in a year. Now, we need to find out how many pensils were sold during this time period. According to the question, Polaroid sold 52 pensils in the first month, which means they sold 52/12 = 4.33 pensils per week. Similarly, they sold 53 pensils in the second month, which means they sold 53/12 = 4.42 pensils per week. Therefore, the total number of pensils sold by Polaroid in a year is: 364 days x 4.33 pensils/week (first month) + 364 days x 4.42 pensils/week (second month) = 1598.06 pensils/year.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensil (or pencils) Harvale had before he gave one away and then calculate how many are left after giving one away.  So, let's break down the information given in the question:  Polla has 521 boxes of pencils, each containing 154 pencils. This means that Polla has a total of 79,304 pencils (521 x 154). Now, we are told that Harvale took one pencil from this stock and gave it away. So, after taking one pencil away, there are now 79,303 pencils left with Polla. Therefore, the answer is 79,303.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensil shillings are there in total based on the information given in the question.  The total number of polls is 531 and each poll has 38 rejsers. So, the total number of rejsers is 531 x 38 = 20,488 rejsers. Now, we need to convert these rejsers into pensil shillings. One rejr is equal to 0.0625 pensil shillings, so we can calculate the total number of pensil shillings as follows:  Total number of rejsers = 20,488 rejsers x 0.0625 pensil shillings/rejr = 1,272 pensil shillings Therefore, there are approximately 1,272 pensil shillings in total based on the information provided in the question.
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are left after one box of 601 pens is used and 406 pens are taken out. So, we need to subtract 406 from 601.  Therefore, there are 295 pens left (601 - 406 = 295).
Response:  We know that in one year (365 days), there are approximately 291 weeks. So, if we divide the total number of days in a year by the number of weeks in a year, we get an average of 708 rangoit pents per week. Now, let's calculate how many rangoit pents Polla will have in a year. If Polla has 315 gamas, then he will have 315 x 708 = 224,300 rangoit pents in a year. Therefore, the answer is 224,300 rangoit pents.
Response:  We know that Polla is 267 years old and has 308 pens in his box. He gave away 231 pens to his friends. So, he had 77 pens left with him initially. Now, let's calculate how many pens he gave away per friend. To do this, we need to divide the number of pens given away (231) by the number of friends (3). Therefore, Polla gave away approximately 77 pens per friend.
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are left after one pen is taken away from 457 pens and then we need to calculate how many more pens are required to make up for the loss of one pen. So, let's start with the calculation:  Number of pens left = 457 - 1 = 456 Now, we know that 320 pens are required to fill up the gap of one pen lost. So, we can calculate the number of extra pens needed as follows: Extra pens needed = Total number of pens available x Percentage of loss = 456 x (1/523) = 8.79 Therefore, there are 8 extra pens needed to make up for the loss of one pen.
Response:  We have 11 water bottles initially. If each water bottle contains 3 glasses of water, then we have a total of 33 glasses of water (11 x 3 = 33). Now, if 2 more people join and take 2 glasses of water each, then there are now 35 glasses of water in total (33 + 2 = 35). So, there are 2 extra glasses of water left after 2 new people join (35 - 33 = 2).
Response:  We have three water bottles and four customers. Each customer can take one or two bottles from the total of three bottles. So, in total, we need to calculate how many bottles each customer will take.  For the first customer, there are only two bottles left after they take one bottle, so they can take another bottle or none at all. Therefore, the first customer takes one bottle.  For the second customer, there are still three bottles left, so they can take any number of bottles between zero and three. Since they took two bottles, there is one bottle remaining for the third customer.  For the third customer, there is only one bottle left, so they cannot take any more bottles. Thus, the third customer does not take any bottles.  In summary, the three customers take one, two, and zero bottles respectively, for a total of three bottles taken.
Response:  We have 12 water bottles and each bottle contains 500 ml of water. So, in total we have 6 liters of water (12 x 500 ml). Now, out of these 6 liters, 3 liters are used for other purposes (not just drinking water), so we are left with 3 liters of water that can be drunk directly from the bottle (6 - 3 = 3). Therefore, there are 3 grAhk (or 3 liters) of water available to drink directly from the bottle.
Response:  We have 14 customers in total. If 5 of them are left, then we have 9 customers remaining (14 - 5 = 9). So, there are 9 customers ahead of us (9 - 5 = 4). Therefore, there are 4 customers ahead of us.
Response:  We have 13 customers initially and then we gain 4 new customers. So, the total number of customers now is 13 + 4 = 17. But, out of these 17 customers, 9 are existing customers who were there earlier, so the number of new customers gained is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 new customers.
Response:  We have 12 original customers and 15 new customers. So, in total we have 12 + 15 = 27 customers. Now, out of these 27 customers, 14 are existing customers who were already there before the new customers arrived. Therefore, the number of new customers is 27 - 14 = 13.
Response:  We have 3 water bottles initially containing 8 liters of water each. Now, we add 2 more bottles to the set, and each bottle contains 10 liters of water. So, in total, we now have 3 + 2 = 5 bottles with 8 x 3 + 10 x 2 = 40 liters of water. Therefore, there are 4 new grahak (customers) who come to buy water after adding the two new bottles.
Response:  We have 5 old customers who bought something from us in the past (A1). Now we want to know how many new customers will buy from us after our price increase (A2). From the given information, we can see that out of 99 new customers, 90 will not come back (B1), and 9 will come back (B2). So, the total number of new customers who will buy from us after the price increase is: A2 = B1 + B2 = 90 + 9 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 new customers who will buy from us after the price increase.
Response:  We have 12 customers in total. Out of them, 4 customers left and 8 new customers arrived at the store. So, the number of customers remaining is: 12 - 4 = 8. Now, out of these 8 customers, 3 are old customers who had already visited the store before (as per the question). So, the number of new customers who visited the store for the first time is: 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  Dan has $30 and he spends $2 on chocolates. So, his remaining amount is $30 - $2 = $28. Now, he meets Alice who gives him $10 as a gift. So, Dan now has $28 + $10 = $38.
Response:  We know that Dan has $40 and he spends $15 on chocolates at the candy bar. So, his remaining amount is $40 - $15 = $25. Now, we are told that there are three pieces of chocolate in each pack, so the cost per piece of chocolate is $25 / 3 = $8.33. Therefore, the price of one piece of chocolate is $8.33.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Dan has after buying 99 chocolates at $3 each. So, total amount spent = Number of chocolates x Price per chocolate = 99 x $3 = $297. Now, we know that Dan had $400 initially and he spent $297 on chocolates, so his remaining balance is: Remaining balance = Initial amount - Amount spent = $400 - $297 = $103. Therefore, there are $103 left with Dan.
Response:  We have to find out how much each chocolate bar costs and then multiply it by the number of chocolate bars Dan bought. So, let's start with finding out how much each chocolate bar costs: According to the question, each chocolate bar costs $2. Now, we know that Dan bought 4 chocolate bars, so he paid $8 for them (4 x $2 = $8). Therefore, the cost of each chocolate bar is $2.
Response:  We have $20 and we want to buy 6 chocolates worth $3 each. So, total cost of buying 6 chocolates = $20 x 6 = $120. Therefore, there are 8 chocolates left after buying 6 chocolates ($120 / $3 per chocolate = 8 chocolates).
Response:  We have $7 in total and we spend $2 on chocolates at the bar and $3 on chocolates that are left over from last time. So, how much money do we have left? $$ Total amount = $7 \therefore Money left = Total amount - (Money spent) = $7 - ($2 + $3) = $7 - ($5) = $2 $$ Therefore, there are $2 left after buying chocolates.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he spends $7 on chocolates at the bar. So, his remaining amount is $4 - $7 = $-3. Now, he buys another chocolate worth $6, so his new balance is $-3 + $6 = $3. Therefore, the number of dollars that Dan pays for each chocolate is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
Response:  Dan has $20 and he spends $6 on chocolates at the bar. So, his remaining amount is $20 - $6 = $14. Now, he spends another $3 on chocolates outside the bar, so his remaining amount becomes $14 - $3 = $11. Therefore, the total amount spent on chocolates is $11.
Response:  Dan has $5 and he spends $2 on chocolate at the bar. So, his remaining amount is $3. Now, he spends another $3 on chocolate at Vikat's shop. Therefore, his remaining amount after buying both chocolates is $0.
Response:  Dan has $40 and he spends $8 on chocolates for his friends. So, he is left with $32. Then, his friends give him $5 as a gift. Therefore, Dan now has $37 ($32 + $5).
Response:  We know that Danica has $3 in change from her last purchase at Chocky's Diner. If she buys another chocolate bar worth $4, how much will be left in her change? So, the amount left in her change after buying another chocolate bar is $3 - $4 = $-1.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Dan has after buying 10 chocolates at $3 each. So, total amount spent on chocolates = 10 x $3 = $30. Now, we know that Dan had $40 initially and he spent $30 on chocolates, so his remaining amount = Initial amount - Amount spent = $40 - $30 = $10. Therefore, Dan has $10 left after buying 10 chocolates at $3 each.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Dan has and how many chocolates he can buy with that amount.  From the question, we know that Dan has $30.  So, he can buy x chocolates at $4 each.  To find out how many chocolates Dan can buy, we need to divide $30 by $4.  Therefore, Dan can buy 7 chocolates ($30 / $4 = 7).
Response:  Dan has $5 and he spends $3 on chocolate. So, he has $2 left. Now, he buys another bar of chocolate for $7. How much does he spend in total?  Total amount spent = $3 + $7 = $10.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he spends $7 on chocolate. So, his remaining amount is $4 - $7 = $-3. Now, he buys another bar of chocolate for $2. So, his new remaining amount is $-3 + $2 = $-1. Therefore, Dan has $1 left after buying the second bar of chocolate.
Response:  We know that 115 books are sold in total and out of those, 78 books are returned as defective. So, the number of non-defective books left = Total number of books - Number of defective books = 115 - 78 = 37 books.
"Response:  We know that there are 137 books in Gargee's collection and each book has 105 pages. So, the total number of pages in all the books is: 137 x 105 = 14255 pages. Now, we need to find out how many books have at least one page with the word ""Polakde"". To do this, we can randomly select a page from each book and check if it contains the word ""Polakde"". If it does, then we count it as one book with at least one page containing the word ""Polakde"". Therefore, the probability of any particular book having at least one page with the word ""Polakde"" is: Number of books with at least one page containing ""Polakde"" = Total number of books x Probability of selecting a book with at least one page containing ""Polakde"" = 14255 pages x (1/137) = 0.00736 Approximately 0.736% of the books in Gargee's collection have at least one page with the word ""Polakde""."
Response:  We know that there are 108 books in total and out of those, 35 books are written by Gargee Vikrit. So, the number of books written by Gargee Vikrit is 35/108 = 0.327 (approximately).
Response:  We know that there are 50 books in total and Garage Vikrit has sold 35 of them. So, the remaining books left with him are 50 - 35 = 15. Now, we need to find out how many books each of the 151 customers bought. Since each customer can buy at most one book, the number of books bought by each customer is 151 / 1 = 150. Therefore, the total number of books sold by Garage Vikrit is 35 + 150 = 185 books.
Response:  We have two books with 150 new words each. If we take away 58 words from one book and add them to another, how many words will be left in each book? So, the number of words left in each book = Number of words in each book - Number of words added from other book. Therefore, the number of words left in each book = 2 x 150 - 58 = 72 Each book has 72 words left after adding/removing words.
Response:  We know that 21 books were written before and after the creation of the new version. So, the total number of books written is: 21 + (42 - 15) = 68 books. Therefore, out of these 68 books, the number of books that were not included in the new version is: 68 - 42 = 26 books.
Response:  We know that 71 books were written before the invention of paper. Now, out of these 71 books, 38 new books have been added to the existing collection after the invention of paper. So, the total number of books available now is 71 + 38 = 109 books. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 109 books.
"Response:  We have 108 books and 55 pens.  Out of these, 66 books and 59 pens are gifted. So, the number of books that are not gifted is:

108 - 66 = 42

So, out of 108 books, 42 are not gifted."
"Response:  We have 51 books and 106 pens.  Out of these, 82 books and 14 pens are garage sale items. So, the number of pens that were not sold at the garage sale is:

106 - 14 = 92

Therefore, 92 pens did not sell at the garage sale."
Response:  We are given that there are 27 books in total and we have to find out how many of them are written by Gargee Vikal. So, let's assume that all the books written by Gargee Vikal are marked with an 'G'. Now, we know that among these 27 books, 136 are not written by Gargee Vikal (as per the statement). Therefore, the number of books written by Gargee Vikal is:  Number of books written by Gargee Vikal = Total number of books - Number of books not written by Gargee Vikal = 27 - 136 = -109 Books written by Gargee Vikal do not exist as per the information provided in the question.
Response:  We know that there are 134 books in total and out of them, 39 are given to friends as gifts. So, the number of books left with the original owner is 134 - 39 = 95 books. Now, we need to find out how many books are sold at a discount of 68%. To do this, we will use the formula: Number of books sold = Total number of books x Discount percentage / 100. Substituting the values, we get: Number of books sold = 95 x (68/100) = 62 books. Therefore, 62 books are sold at a discount of 68%.
Response:  We have 95 pens and 153 books.  If we divide the number of books by the number of pens, we get an average of 160 pages per pen (books / pens = 160). Now, let's assume that each book has 400 pages (a rough estimate). So, if we multiply the number of books by their average page count, we get 64,000 pages (153 books x 400 pages/book = 64,000 pages). Therefore, there are approximately 64,000 pages in the 95 pens.
Response:  We have 42 books and 143 pens.  Since each book requires 10 pens to complete, we need 42 x 10 = 420 pens for all the books. Now, there are 113 books and 19 pens left over after completing all the books. So, the number of pens required to complete one book is: Number of pens required per book = Total number of pens available for completion of books - Number of books completed Number of pens available for completion of books = 420 pens - 113 books = 307 pens Therefore, Garry needs 307 pens to complete one book.
Response:  There are 10 flowers in total (5 red and 5 blue). Jesica picks up 8 red flowers and leaves 2 red flowers behind. Now there are 8 red flowers left with Jesica. Since she has already picked up 8 red flowers, she cannot pick up any more red flowers. So, the number of red flowers that Jesica has is 8. Similarly, since there were initially 5 blue flowers and Jesica picked up none of them, the number of blue flowers remaining after Jesica finished picking up the red flowers is still 5. Therefore, the final answer is: Red flowers - 8 Blue flowers - 5
Response:  There are 16 flowers in each pot and there are 5 pots in total. So, the total number of flowers is 16 x 5 = 80 flowers. Now, out of these 80 flowers, 23 are red. Therefore, the number of red flowers in the garden is 23.
Response:  There are two flowers in each pot (a total of 4 pots). Each flower has 5 petals, so there are 20 petals in total (4 x 5 = 20). Now, we need to find out how many new flowers will be formed after 23 days. Since each flower takes 5 days to bloom and then withers away, we can assume that after 23 days, only 18 flowers will have bloomed (23 - 5 = 18). So, the number of new flowers formed is 18.
Response:  Jesica has given 33 gulabs to Fuldaan and took 15 gulabs from him. So, there are 18 gulabs left with Fuldaan (33 - 15 = 18). Now, Fuldaan gives some of his remaining gulabs to Tyagi, who takes 17 gulabs from him. Therefore, there are 1 gulab left with Fuldaan after giving it to Tyagi (18 - 17 = 1).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 gulabs in total and Jesika has already picked 34 of them. So, there are remaining 15 gulabs left. Now, let's assume that each bag contains an equal number of gulabs. Therefore, if Jesika picks bags containing 5 gulabs each, she will get 75 gulabs (15 x 5 = 75). However, since she has already picked 34 gulabs, there are only 41 gulabs left for her to pick from the remaining bags (75 - 34 = 41).
Response:  There are 7 flowers in total (including the one that is already picked).  If Jesica picks 5 more flowers, then there will be 12 flowers left (including the one she has already picked). So, the number of flowers Jesica can pick = 12 - 5 = 7.
Response:  There are 13 flowers in total (including the one that is already picked).  Jesica has picked 12 of them, so there are only 1 flower left. Therefore, there are 12 + 1 = 13 flowers remaining in the bag.
Response:  There are 15 gulabs and 62 orkids in Tyan's garden. Each gulab has 3 bags of soil, and each bag contains 4 orkids. Therefore, there are 15 x 3 = 45 gulab bags in total. Since there are 62 orkids in the garden, each bag of soil contains 45 / 62 = 0.72 orkids. So, Tyan has 17 gulabs (15 original + 2 additional) with approximately 12.16 orkids per gulab.
Response:  We have 12 gulabs and 2 orkids. So, each gulab has 6 orkids ( since there are 2 orkids for every gulab). Therefore, the total number of orkids is 12 x 6 = 72.  So, there are 72 orkids in total.
Response:  We have 5 gulabs and 3 orkids in total. Each gulab has 12 flowers, so there are 60 flowers altogether (5 x 12 = 60). Now, each orkid has 2 flowers, so there are 60 + 2 = 62 flowers in total. Therefore, there are 12 more flowers with orkids than with gulabs.
Response:  We have 7 full bags of grapes and 30 oranges in total. Each bag of grapes contains 11 grape clusters, and each cluster has 4 grapes. Therefore, we have a total of 7 x 11 = 77 grape clusters. Similarly, each orange is contained in one bag, so we have 30 oranges in total. Now, let's calculate how many oranges are there in each bag of grapes: Since there are 7 bags of grapes, and each bag contains 11 grape clusters, we can say that each bag of grapes contains an average of 77 / 7 = 10.6 oranges (approximately). So, there are approximately 10.6 oranges in each bag of grapes.
Response:  Jessica has 19 gulabs and she wants to distribute them equally among 3 friends. So, each friend will get 6 gulabs (19 / 3 = 6). Now, there are 3 remaining gulabs, which Jessica can keep for herself. Therefore, the final number of gulabs that Jessica gets is 3 + 6 = 9.
Response:  We have 13 full moons in a year and each full moon has approximately 29.5 days. So, there are 13 x 29.5 = 364.5 days in a year. Now, we know that Jesus was born on December 25th, which is the 84th day after the first full moon of the year (i.e., January 1st). Therefore, the number of gulabs (moons) between Jesus' birth and the current date will be: 84 - 13 = 71 gulabs.
Response:  We have 16 flowers and 3 orchids in total.  From each flower, we can collect 2 petals, so we will get 32 petals from all the flowers (16 x 2 = 32). Now, out of these 32 petals, we need to give 7 orchids, which means we will have 25 petals left after giving them (32 - 7 = 25). So, there are 25 orchid capsules.
Response:  We have 6 gulabs and 20 orkids in total.  From the jesica's flower pot, we can take out 3 gulabs and 10 orkids. So, now we have 6 gulabs and 10 orkids left.  Now, let's assume that each orkid lays 2 eggs, so after laying eggs, we will have 22 orkids (2 x 11).  Since there are no more gulabs available to add to the equation, the number of orkids will increase by 22. Therefore, the answer is 23 orkids.
Response:  We know that there are 9 gulabs and 6 orkids in Tyrannosaurus Rex's stomach. Each gulab contains 13 orkids, so we have 13 x 9 = 117 orkids in total. Therefore, the number of orkids in T-Rex's stomach is 117.
Response:  The length of Robin's case is 17 inches and he has 3 cases in total. So, the total length of all his cases is: 17 inches x 3 = 51 inches.
Response:  If Robin has 20 inches of kite string and he wants to make it longer by 10 inches, then how long will the remaining part of the string be? So, the length of the remaining string = Total length of the string - Length added (in this case, 10 inches) = 20 inches - 10 inches = 10 inches.
Response:  The length of Robin's case is 16 inches and it has 11 inches long handle. Now, if we add the length of the handle to the length of the case, we get 27 inches (16 + 11 = 27). So, the length of Robin's case is 27 inches.
Response:  If Robin's case is 19 inches long and he has 18 inches left, then his remaining length would be 19 - 18 = 1 inch. So, Robin's remaining length is 1 inch.
Response:  We know that Robin has 13 inches of kite string and he wants to fly it for 14 inches. So, we need to find out how much extra length of string he needs to add to his existing string to make it 14 inches long. To do this, we can simply subtract the original length (13 inches) from the desired length (14 inches): Extra length = Desired length - Original length = 14 inches - 13 inches = 1 inch Therefore, Robin needs an additional 1 inch of string to make his kite fly at a height of 14 inches.
Response:  We know that Robin has 14 inches in length and he loses 8 inches. So, his remaining length is 6 inches (14 - 8 = 6). Now, we are asked how many feet he will have if he has 20 inches of height. Since there are 12 inches in one foot, Robin will have 20 / 12 = 1.67 feet tall. Therefore, Robin's case is 1.67 feet long.
Response:  We have 12 balls in total and we want to know how many of them are red. So, if there are 53 balls that are not red, then the number of red balls is 12 - 53 = -41. Therefore, there are no red balls.
Response:  We have 21 balls and we want to know how many of them will be in the park after Danica has played with them for 53 minutes.  To find out, we need to calculate the number of balls that Danica can play with in one minute.  We are given that Danica can hit 4 balls per minute. So, in 53 minutes, she can hit 53 x 4 = 212 balls. Since Danica hits all the balls equally well, half of the total number of balls (which is 21) will be in the park after her game. Therefore, the answer is 10.5 (rounded off to 11).
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 33 races in her career as an IndyCar driver and she won 2 races. So, we can calculate the number of wins per race as follows: Number of wins = Total number of races x Win percentage Now, let's substitute the values we have obtained from the question: Number of wins = 33 x 0.065 (Danica Patrick's win percentage) Number of wins = 2.19 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, Danica Patrick has won approximately 2 races out of every 33 races she participated in during her IndyCar career.
"Response:  We have to find out how many capsules Danie can take from each of the three boxes.  From box A, he can take 36 capsules and leave 28 remaining. From box B, he can take 35 capsules and leave 27 remaining. And from box C, he can take 24 capsules and leave 10 remaining. So, in total, Danie can take 36 + 35 + 24 = 95 capsules. Now, we need to calculate how many capsules are left after Danie takes them all. From box A, there were 28 - 36 = -10 capsules left; from box B, there were 27 - 35 = -8 capsules left; and from box C, there were 10 - 24 = -14 capsules left. Therefore, the final number of capsules left in each box is: Box A: -10 Box B: -8 Box C: -14"
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Dan can kick with his left foot and how many he can kick with his right foot.  Since Dan kicks each ball 30 times, we need to calculate how many kicks he can give in total.  For the left foot, he can kick 42 balls, and for the right foot, he can kick 63 balls. So, in total, Dan can kick 105 balls (42 + 63).
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 22 races and 8 pole positions in her career.  Now, let's calculate how many wins she has based on the information given in the question:  Wins = Races x Poles / 2 (Since there are twice as many poles as races)  So, Wins = 22 x 8 / 2 = 16 wins. Therefore, Danica Patrick has won 16 races in her NASCAR career.
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 22 races and 30 poles in her career.  If we assume that each race has 17 cars (which is a reasonable estimate) and each pole has 5 cars (also a reasonable estimate), then we can calculate the total number of cars raced or poles taken by Danica Patrick as follows: Total Number of Cars Raced = 22 x 17 = 362 Total Number of Poles Taken = 30 x 5 = 150 Therefore, Danica Patrick has raced or taken 362 cars and 150 poles in her career.
Response:  We know that Danica has 30 balls and 14 paddles. Each ball requires 7 strokes to hit it into the opponent's court, so we need to calculate how many strokes Danica needs to hit all of her balls. Therefore, the total number of strokes needed is: 30 x 7 = 210 strokes. Now, let's count the number of paddles required for each stroke: 14 paddles / 7 strokes = 2 paddles per stroke. So, in total, Danica needs 210 strokes x 2 paddles/stroke = 420 paddles to hit all of her balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of Danish beer and packings of snacks can fit in a car with a capacity of 11 boxes and 28 bags. From the given information, we know that there are 68 bottles of beer and 51 packets of snacks. Now, let's calculate the number of boxes required to carry these items. To do this, we need to divide the total weight of the items (i.e., 68 x 0.33 kg/bottle + 51 x 0.2 kg/packet) by the weight of each box (i.e., 0.1 kg). This gives us a total of 194 boxes needed to carry all the items. Since the car has a capacity of 11 boxes, we cannot fit all the items in one car. Therefore, the answer is 17 cars (194 / 11 = 17).
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 71 races and 24 pole positions in her career.  Therefore, we can calculate the number of caps she has won as follows:  Number of caps = (Number of races x Number of poles) / 2 = (71 x 24) / 2 = 35.5 caps So, Danica Patrick has approximately 36 caps in her career.
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 10 batters and 62 packings in her car. From this information, we can calculate the number of tokes she has. To do this, we need to divide the total weight of all the items in her car (10 batters x 5 kg + 62 packings x 3 kg) by the weight of each toke (which is equal to the weight of one battery). So, the number of tokes Danica Patrick has = (Total weight of items / Weight of each toke) = (50 kg + 186 kg) / 5 kg = 41 tokes. Therefore, Danica Patrick has 41 tokes in her car.
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 66 caps in her collection and she wants to give away 25 of them. So, we need to find out how many caps she will have left after giving away 25.  Now, let's calculate it - (66 - 25) = 41. Therefore, Danica Patrick will have 41 caps left in her collection after giving away 25 of them.
Response:  We have 32 balls in total and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 8 balls (32/4 = 8). Now, let's assume that Danica has already taken 25 balls from the park, leaving 7 balls for the other three people. If they share these 7 balls equally among themselves, then each of them will get 1 ball (7/3 = 1). Therefore, the final answer is: 32 - 25 = 7 balls left in the park, and each of the remaining three people gets 1 ball.
Response:  We know that Danica Bateli has 60 tops and she gives away 58 of them. So, she has 2 more tops than what she gave away. Therefore, the number of tops Danica Bateli has after giving away 58 is 2 + 58 = 60.
Response:  We have to find out how many capsules Danie can take in total and then divide it by the number of capsules he takes per day.  So, we need to calculate the total number of capsules Danie can take.  From the question, we know that Danie has 50 new bottles of pills. If each bottle contains 60 pills, then the total number of pills Danie has is: 50 x 60 = 3000 pills. Now, we need to divide this total number of pills by the number of days (junyas) Danie takes them. Since Danie takes 12 bottles of pills every month, and there are 30 days in a month, the number of junyas Danie takes pills in a month is: 12 x 30 = 360 junyas. Therefore, the number of pills Danie takes in a year is: 3000 / 360 = 8.33 years. Now, let's convert this number into months: 8.33 years x 12 months/year = 99.97 months. Finally, we need to divide the total number of pills Danie can take by the number of months he takes them: 3000 pills / 99.97 months = approximately 30.43 pills per month.
Response:  We know that Danie has 54 balls in his pocket and he throws 48 of them into the park. So, after throwing, he has 6 balls left with him. Now, we need to find out how many balls are there in total in the park including the ones thrown by Danie and the ones already present in the park. As per the question, there are 52 balls in the park initially. Therefore, the final number of balls in the park after Danie throws some of them is: Total number of balls = Initial number of balls + Number of balls thrown by Danie - Number of balls he had initially = 52 + (48 - 6) = 52 + 42 = 94 balls.
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 82 packages and 29 bottles of water in her luggage. Each package contains 4 bottles of water, so she has 356 bottles of water in total (82 x 4 = 356). Now, we are asked how many bottles of water Danica has in total. Since each parcel contains 4 bottles of water, Danica has 10 packs of water (356 / 4 = 87). Therefore, Danica has 87 bottles of water in total.
"Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 66 packages and 39 bottles of water in her luggage. Each package contains 16 cups of water, so we have:

66 packages x 16 cups/package = 1056 cups of water

Now, we need to calculate how many bottles of water are needed for 1056 cups of water. Since each bottle contains 17 fluid ounces (fl oz), we can convert the number of cups to fl oz as follows:

1 cup = 8 fl oz

So, we have:

1056 cups x 8 fl oz/cup = 8424 fl oz

Therefore, Danica Patrick needs 8424 bottles of water for 1056 cups of water."
Response:  We know that Danial has 46 packets of chips and 50 bottles of soda. Each packet of chips contains 21 chips, and each bottle of soda contains 520 ml. So, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows: Number of chips = Total number of packets x Number of chips per packet = 46 x 21 = 976 chips Similarly, we can calculate the total volume of soda as follows: Volume of soda = Total number of bottles x Volume of soda per bottle = 50 x 520 ml = 26,000 ml Now, we are asked how many bottles of soda Daniel has. To find this out, we need to divide the total volume of soda by the capacity of each bottle: Number of bottles of soda = Total volume of soda / Capacity of each bottle = 26,000 ml / 520 ml = 50 bottles Therefore, Daniel has 50 bottles of soda.
Response:  We have 65 packets of batteries and 5 boxes of packing materials. Each packet contains 3 batteries, so we have in total 195 batteries (65 x 3 = 195). Now, let's calculate how many packings are needed for each battery. Since there are 9 packages per box, we need 21 boxes to contain all the batteries (195 / 9 = 21). Therefore, Danial has 21 boxes of packing materials.
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 58 caps and 25 packings. From her collection, she has 11 caps and 12 bottles. So, we can say that Danica Patrick has 13 caps (11 + 2) and 12 bottles (25 - 12).
Response:  We know that Danica Patrick has 15 batters and 18 golf balls in her bag. She hits each ball an average of 250 yards. So, she hits a total of 15 x 250 = 3750 yards with her batters. Now, we need to calculate how many parks she can cover with these batters. The length of a park is given as 67 meters. Therefore, Danica covers a distance of 3750 / 67 = 56 parks with her batters.
Response:  We know that 11 - 17 = -6. So, there are 6 fewer ambrosia in Jack's stash than he had initially.
Response:  We know that there are 7 less jackfruits in the village than in the city. So, if there were x jackfruits in the city, then there would be x - 7 = 63 jackfruits in the village. Now we know that the total number of jackfruits in both places is 15 more in the village than in the city. Therefore, the total number of jackfruits in both places is: x + 15 = 63 + 15 = 78. So, there are 78 jackfruits in both places together.
Response:  We know that the number of jackets in the store is 18 more than the number of shirts. So, if there are x shirts in the store, then there are 18 + x jackets. Now we know that the number of jackets in the warehouse is 19 more than the number of shirts. So, if there are x shirts in the warehouse, then there are 19 + x jackets. Therefore, the number of jackets in the warehouse is 19 + (x - 18).
Response:  We know that there are 3 more jackets in the store than customers. So, the number of jackets in the store is 8 + 3 = 11. Now, we know that each customer buys 5 jackets on average. Therefore, the total number of jackets sold is 11 x 5 = 55. Finally, we subtract the number of jackets left in the store (3) from the total number of jackets sold (55), which gives us the number of jackets sold to customers, i.e., 52.
Response:  We know that there are 12 villages in the taluka and each village has 4 hamlets. So, the total number of hamlets is 12 x 4 = 48. Now, we are told that the number of houses in the jackal's territory is 11 more than the number of houses in the jungle. Therefore, the number of houses in the jungle is 48 - 11 = 37.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and 9 hours in a day. So, we have:

Weekly hours = 7 x 24 = 168 hours
Daily hours = 24 hours
Total hours = Weekly hours + Daily hours
= 168 hours + 24 hours
= 192 hours

Now, let's find out how many minutes are in 192 hours:
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes/hour
Minutes total = Minutes per hour x Total hours
= 60 minutes/hour x 192 hours
= 11,520 minutes

So, Jack has worked for 11,520 minutes."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 students in the class and each student has to pay Rs.80 as examination fee. So, the total amount of money collected from all the students is:

7 students x Rs.80 per student = Rs.560

Now, we also know that out of these 7 students, 3 students belong to the same village. So, the amount of money collected from these 3 students is:

3 students x Rs.80 per student = Rs.240

So, the remaining amount of money collected from the other 4 students is:

Rs.560 - Rs.240 = Rs.320

Therefore, the amount of money collected from the entire village (jil) is:

Rs.320 + Rs.240 = Rs.560

Answer: The amount of money collected from the jil (village) is Rs.560."
Response:  We know that there are 9 less than Jack's age and 18 more than Jill's age. So, Jack's age is 16 years old. Now we need to find out how many years older than Jill is Jack. To do this, we subtract Jill's age from Jack's age: 16 - 18 = -2 years. Therefore, Jack is 2 years younger than Jill.
"Response:  We know that Jilpeksha has 18 students and Jeckkad has 5 students. So, we need to find out how many more students Jeckkad has than Jilpeksha. To do this, we can subtract the number of students in Jeckkad from the number of students in Jilpeksha:

Number of students in Jeckkad - Number of students in Jilpeksha = 18 - 5 = 13

So, Jeckkad has 13 more students than Jilpeksha."
Response:  We know that Jilpeksha has 18 students in her class and Jackie has 5 students in his class. So, if we want to find out how many more students Jackie has than Jilpeksha, we need to subtract the number of students in Jackie's class from the number of students in Jilpeksha's class. Therefore, the difference between the number of students in Jackie's class and Jilpeksha's class is 87 - 18 = 69. So, Jackie has 69 more students than Jilpeksha.
Response:  We know that Jack has 16 apples and he gives 5 to Jill. So, now Jack has 11 apples left. Now, we are told that Jill has 12 apples. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jill had and the number of apples Jack gave her is: 12 - 5 = 7 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 12 less than Jack's age and 79 more than Steve's age. So, we can write an equation as follows: Jack's age = Steve's age + (12 - x) Where 'x' is the difference between their ages. Now, we have to find out what value of 'x' satisfies both the conditions given in the question. Let's analyze them carefully: For Jack, his age must be greater than or equal to 12, since he is 12 years younger than Steve. So, we can write another equation for Jack's age: Jack's age >= 12 Now, let's combine these two equations: Jack's age = Steve's age + (12 - x) Jack's age >= 12 Substituting Steve's age from the first equation, we get: Jack's age = Steve's age + (12 - x) = 79 + (12 - x) Since we want Jack's age to be greater than or equal to 12, we can set the lower bound of 'x' as 0. Therefore, the value of 'x' that satisfies both the conditions is 0. So, Jack's age is 79 years old.
Response:  We know that there are 13 jackets and 3 shirts in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Jackets = 13 Shirts = 3 Now, let's find out how many shirts Steve has. From the information given in the question, Steve has 9 jackets and 8 shirts. Therefore, we can write another equation: Steve's jackets = 9 Steve's shirts = 8 Now, we have two equations and two variables (Jackets and Shirts). To solve this system of linear equations, we need to use substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the first equation for Jackets, we get: Jackets = 13 - Shirts Substituting this value into the second equation, we get: 9 = 13 - 8 Therefore, Steve has 5 shirts.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 less than 17 and 8 more than 16. So, we can write:

17 - 6 = 11 (the number of apples in the first basket)
16 + 8 = 24 (the number of oranges in the second basket)

Now, let's find out how many oranges are in the first basket:

Number of oranges in the first basket = Number of apples in the first basket x Number of apples per orange
= 11 x 3 (since each apple represents 3 oranges)
= 33 oranges

So, there are 33 oranges in the first basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 minutes in an hour and 60 minutes in a degree. So, we can convert the time from degrees to hours as follows:

30 minutes = 0.5 hours (since there are 30 minutes in one hour)
12 hours = 720 minutes (since there are 12 hours in one day)
15 hours = 900 minutes (since there are 15 hours in one day)

Now, let's find out how many hours are equivalent to 120 seconds:

1 second = 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in one hour)
120 seconds = 120 x 60 = 7200 minutes (since there are 120 seconds in one hour)

So, the number of hours equivalent to 120 seconds is 7200 / 60 = 120 hours."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 villages in the area and each village has 40 houses. So, the total number of houses in all the 12 villages is:

12 x 40 = 480 houses

Now, we know that out of these 480 houses, 67 houses are in the first 12 villages. So, the number of houses in the remaining 10 villages is:

480 - 67 = 413 houses

Therefore, Jekkad has 413 houses."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 villages in the taluka and each village has 12 houses. So, the total number of houses in all 18 villages is:

18 x 12 = 216

Now, we know that out of these 216 houses, 80 houses are in the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad. So, the number of houses under the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad is:

80 / 18 = 4.44 (approximately)

Therefore, there are approximately 4.44 houses under the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad in each village."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 villages in the taluka and each village has 12 houses. So, the total number of houses in the taluka is:

19 x 12 = 228

Now, we know that out of these 228 houses, 72 are located in the jurisdiction of the circle office. Therefore, the number of houses outside the jurisdiction of the circle office is:

228 - 72 = 156

So, there are 156 houses in the taluka that fall under the jurisdiction of the circle office."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 villages in the taluka and each village has 6-7 houses. So, the total number of houses in all the villages is:

14 x 6 = 84 houses

Now, we know that out of these 84 houses, 30 houses are in the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad. Therefore, the number of houses under the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad is:

30 / 14 = 2.14 (approximately)

So, there are approximately 214 houses under the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad."
Response:  We know that there are 84 more steps in the stairs and 10 less steps in the landing. So, the total number of steps in the stairs is 93 (84 + 10). Now, we need to find out how many steps Jack took. According to the question, Jack took 13 steps upstairs and 52 steps downstairs. Therefore, the total number of steps taken by Jack is 65 (13 + 52).
Response:  We know that there are 13 more safaris than jackals and 17 less ambles than jackals. So, if there were x jackals, then there would be 13 + x safaris. Similarly, if there were y ambles, then there would be 17 - y ambles. Now we have two equations: 13x = 20 (from the number of safaris) and 17y = 15 (from the number of ambles). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 8 and y = 12. Therefore, there are 8 jackals and 12 ambles.
Response:  We know that there are 8 hours in a day and 10 days in a week. So, if we multiply 8 hours/day x 10 days/week = 80 hours/week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Steve has worked in total. If he works for 11 weeks, then he has worked for 11 x 80 hours/week = 880 hours. Finally, to find out how much money Steve has earned, we need to divide his total working hours by his hourly wage. Let's assume his hourly wage is $25 per hour. Then, Steve has earned $880 / $25/hour = $35,200.
Response:  We know that there are 3 less than 19 and 4 more than 15. So, we can write: 19 - 3 = 16 And 16 + 4 = 20 Therefore, the number of steps is 20.
Response:  The total amount of money that Oliva spent is $78. If Supermarket charged him $15 as discount, then the actual price he paid would be: Actual Price = Total Amount - Discount = $78 - $15 = $63 So, the remaining amount of money that Olivia has after purchasing the items from Supermarket is: Remaining Money = Total Amount - Actual Price = $78 - $63 = $15
Response:  The cost of one suitcase is $78 and there are 33 suitscases in total. So, the total cost of all the suitscases is $78 x 33 = $2594. Now, if 10 suitscases were sold at $33 each, then the total revenue generated would be $33 x 10 = $330. Therefore, the profit made from selling these 10 suitscases would be $2594 - $330 = $2264.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva spent $100 at Supermarket A and $80 at Supermarket B. So, the total amount he spent is:

$100 + $80 = $180

Now, we are given that the difference between the cost price of the goods purchased at Supermarket A and Supermarket B is $148. Therefore, the cost price of the goods purchased at Supermarket A is:

$180 - $148 = $32

So, the amount of money that Olivia saved by shopping at Supermarket B is:

$80 (cost price of goods at Supermarket B) - $32 (cost price of goods at Supermarket A) = $48

Therefore, the correct answer is $48."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva bought $30 worth of goods from Supermarket A and paid $49 as mark-up fee to Supermarket B. So, the total amount spent by Olivia is: $30 + ($49 x 15/100) = $30 + $7.35 = $37.35 Now, let's see how much money Supermarket B earned through this transaction. Since Supermarket B charged a mark-up fee of $49 on the $30 worth of goods purchased by Olivia, the profit earned by Supermarket B is: $49 x 15/100 = $7.35 Therefore, the difference between the amount spent by Olivia and the profit earned by Supermarket B is: $37.35 - $7.35 = $30 So, Supermarket B earned $30 in this transaction.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva bought $53 worth of goods from Supermarket A and paid $91 in cash. So, the change he received was $38. Now, we need to find out how much money Eva spent at Supermarket B. We know that she spent $14 more than what Oliva spent at Supermarket A. Therefore, if Oliva spent $53, then Eva spent $53 + $14 = $67 at Supermarket B. Finally, we can calculate the amount of money Eva gave to Oliva as change by subtracting the amount she spent at Supermarket B ($67) from the total amount of money Oliva received ($91). Hence, the change given to Oliva by Eva is $91 - $67 = $24.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva has $106 in her wallet and she spends $26 on a supermarket bill. So, now she has $80 left in her wallet. Then, she buys a shirt worth $49 from a store. Now, let's calculate how much money is left with Olivia after purchasing the shirt. Total amount spent = $26 + $49 = $75 Total amount left = $80 - $75 = $5 Therefore, there is $5 left with Olivia after buying the shirt.
"Response:  The cost of Supermarket A is $29 per square foot and Supermarket B costs $54 per square foot. If Supermarket A has an area of 10,000 square feet, then its total cost would be:
Supermarket A Cost = Area x Price per Square Foot
= 10,000 sq ft x $29/sq ft
= $290,000
Now, let's calculate the cost of Supermarket B based on its area of 15,000 square feet:
Supermarket B Cost = Area x Price per Square Foot
= 15,000 sq ft x $54/sq ft
= $760,000
So, the difference in cost between Supermarket A and Supermarket B is:
Difference = Supermarket B Cost - Supermarket A Cost
= $760,000 - $290,000
= $470,000"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva spent $38 on supermarket items. Now, if she bought 128 items, then each item cost her approximately $\$0.30$. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent on supermarket items is: $$ \therefore Total\ amount = 128\times \$0.30 = \$38 + \$38 = \$76$$ So, there are $76 in cash left with Olivia after buying supermarket items.
Response:  We know that 19 apps were downloaded and out of those, 5 apps were deleted. So, the number of remaining apps is 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 apps left in Devyani's phone.
Response:  We know that there are 18 melons and we have to choose 5 of them. So, the number of possible combinations is 18C5 = 3240. Therefore, there can be up to 3240 different apps based on those 18 melons.
Response:  The number of apps Dev has developed is 10. He adds 11 new apps and deletes 4 old ones. So, the total number of apps he has now is 15 (11 + 4). Therefore, out of these 15 apps, Kiti has deleted 3 (since she has 3 less than Dev).
Response:  The number of apps Dev had in his phone was 21. He added 89 new apps and deleted 24 old ones. So, the total number of apps he had after deleting some is 89 - 24 = 65.
Response:  The number of apps in Dev's phone is 15 and he added 7 new apps. So, the total number of apps in his phone now is 22 (15 + 7). Now, out of these 22 apps, 14 are not used anymore. Therefore, the number of apps that Dev uses is 8 (22 - 14).
"Response:  We have 16 apps and 77 files in total. Out of these, 5 apps and 23 files are deleted. So, the number of apps that were not deleted is:

Number of apps that were not deleted = Total number of apps - Number of apps deleted = 16 - 5 = 11

Therefore, 11 apps were not deleted."
Response:  We have 17 apps and 21 files in total. Out of these, 3 apps and 7 files are deleted. So, the number of remaining apps is 17 - 3 = 14, and the number of remaining files is 21 - 7 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 apps and 14 files left after deletion.
Response:  We have 15 apps and 24 files in total. Out of these, 7 apps and 3 files are deleted. So, we have 8 apps and 21 files left. Now, out of these 8 apps, 4 are games. Therefore, there are 4 games among the remaining apps.
Response:  We have 19 apps and 18 files in total. Out of these, 6 apps and 15 files are deleted. So, the remaining number of apps is 19 - 6 = 13. Similarly, the remaining number of files is 18 - 15 = 3. Therefore, out of the 19 apps, 4 are left untouched (i.e., not deleted), and out of the 18 files, 2 are left untouched.
Response:  We know that 17 apps are installed on Devika's phone. Out of these, 18 apps were downloaded from the Play Store. So, we can conclude that 1 app was not downloaded from the Play Store. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1 app.
Response:  We have 59 apps and 15 apps are deleted. So, the number of remaining apps is 59 - 15 = 44. Now, out of these 44 apps, 12 apps are delisted. Therefore, the number of remaining delisted apps is 44 - 12 = 32.
Response:  We have 24 files and 13 apps in total. Among them, some are deleted. So, we need to find out how many files and apps were not deleted. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of non-deleted files = Total number of files - Deleted files Number of non-deleted apps = Total number of apps - Deleted apps Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of files = 24 Files that are not deleted = 20 (since 4 files are deleted) Total number of apps = 13 Apps that are not deleted = 9 (since 4 apps are deleted) Therefore, there are 20 non-deleted files and 9 non-deleted apps.
Response:  We have 24 apps and 9 files in total. Out of these, 5 files and 12 apps are deleted. So, the number of remaining apps is 12 - 5 = 7. Similarly, the number of remaining files is 9 - 9 = 0. Therefore, there are 7 apps and 0 files left on the phone after deletion.
Response:  We have 11 apps and 3 files in total.  Out of these, 24 files are left after deleting some apps and 2 apps are still available. So, the number of remaining apps is 11 - 2 = 9.
Response:  We know that Neel has 243 cards and he distributed them equally among his friends. So each friend got 136 cards. Now we want to find out how many cards are left with Neel. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cards given to his friends from the total number of cards he had. Therefore, the number of cards left with Neel is:  Number of cards left with Neel = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to friends = 243 - (136 x 5) = 243 - 680 = -437 cards. So there are 437 cards left with Neel.
Response:  We know that Neel has 301 cards and he gave away 154 of them. So, the number of cards left with him is 301 - 154 = 147 cards.
Response:  Neil has 308 cards in total (528 - 252 = 308). He gave away 11 cards to Jeff. So, he has 308 - 11 = 297 cards left.
Response:  We know that Neel has 566 cards and Jeff has 234 cards. So, in total, they have 798 cards. Now, we are asked how many cards Jeff has left after giving some to Neel. Since Jeff had 234 cards initially and he gave 100 cards to Neel, Jeff now has 134 cards left (234 - 100 = 134). Therefore, Jeff has 134 cards left.
"Response:  We know that there are 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs. So, we have:

309 baseball cards = 309 x 10 = 3090 cards (ten-card packs)

Now, let's find out how many ten-card packs contain 415 baseball cards:

Number of ten-card packs containing 415 baseball cards = Number of ten-card packs - Number of ten-card packs with less than 415 baseball cards
= 356 - (28 x 10)
= 356 - 280
= 76

So, there are 76 ten-card packs that contain 415 baseball cards. Now, let's find out how many ten-card packs contain 149 baseball cards:

Number of ten-card packs containing 149 baseball cards = Number of ten-card packs - Number of ten-card packs with less than 149 baseball cards
= 76 - (13 x 10)
= 76 - 130
= 46

So, there are 46 ten-card packs that contain 149 baseball cards. Finally, we need to find out how many ten-card packs contain exactly 10 baseball cards:

Number of ten-card packs containing exactly 10 baseball cards = Total number of ten-card packs - Number of ten-card packs containing 415 or more baseball cards - Number of ten-card packs containing 149 or fewer baseball cards
= 356 - 76 - 46
= 244

So, there are 244 ten-card packs that contain exactly 10 baseball cards. Therefore, Neel has 244 ten-card packs with exactly 10 baseball cards each."
"Response:  We know that there are 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card packs. So, we have:

Number of baseball cards = 246
Number of ten-card packs = 214
Now, let's find out how many cards are left after removing 10 cards from each pack:

Number of cards left in each pack = Number of cards in pack - Number of removed cards
= 214 - 10
= 204
So, there are 204 cards left after removing 10 cards from each pack. Now, let's calculate the number of remaining baseball cards:

Remaining baseball cards = Total number of baseball cards - Number of cards used for ten-card packs
= 246 - (214 x 10)
= 246 - 2140
= 392
Therefore, there are 392 remaining baseball cards."
Response:  Neil has 573 cards and gives 195 to John. So, he still has 378 cards left. Now, out of these remaining 378 cards, Neil gave 210 cards to Jeff. Therefore, Neil has 168 cards left with him.
"Response:  We know that there are 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. Each pack contains 10 cards, so we have:

438 baseball cards / 18 packs = 24 cards per pack

Now, let's find out how many packs contain 10 cards each:

18 packs x 10 cards/pack = 180 cards

So, there are 180 cards in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them are baseball cards:

180 cards - 178 baseball cards = 2 non-baseball cards

Therefore, there are 2 non-baseball cards among the 180 cards."
"Response:  We know that there are 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card packs of basketball cards. So, we have:

Baseball cards: 239
Ten-card packs of basketball cards: 38 x 10 = 380
Total number of cards: 239 + 380 = 619
Now, let's find out how many baseball cards are in each ten-card pack of basketball cards:
Number of baseball cards per ten-card pack of basketball cards = Total number of baseball cards / Number of ten-card packs of basketball cards = 619 / 38 = 17
So, there are 17 baseball cards in each ten-card pack of basketball cards."
Response:  We have 19 cups of water and we need to fill 35 cups. So, we will need 16 more cups of water (35 - 19 = 16).
Response:  We know that there are 28 balls in total and we have to distribute them equally among 7 players. So, each player will get 4 balls (28/7 = 4). Now let's calculate how many balls each player will get if we divide the remaining balls equally among themselves after distributing them to all 7 players. There are 21 balls left after dividing them equally among all 7 players (28 - 4 x 7 = 21). Therefore, each of the remaining 6 players will get 3 balls (21 / 6 = 3). So, the final distribution is as follows: Player 1 gets 4 balls, Players 2-7 get 3 balls each.
Response:  We have to find out how many biscuits are left after eating 40 cookies and then divide it by 2 to get the number of biscuits that remain. So, we can calculate as follows: Number of biscuits remaining = Total number of biscuits - Number of biscuits eaten = 37 - 40 = -3 Number of biscuits remaining = -3 / 2 = -1.5 Therefore, there are -1.5 biscuits left.
Response:  We have 25 cookies and we want to share them equally among 5 people. So each person will get 5 cookies (25/5 = 5). Now, there are 3 extra cookies left over after sharing them equally among 5 people. So these 3 extra cookies will be shared among the remaining 2 people (i.e., 2 + 1 = 3). Therefore, the total number of cookies that each person will get is: 5 + 3 = 8 cookies per person.
Response:  We have 13 cups of water and we need to fill 2 buckets with it. So, we will have 2 x 13 = 26 cups of water left after filling 2 buckets. Now, there are 36 biscuits in total. If each bucket can hold 4 biscuits, then we will have 26 / 4 = 6 remaining biscuits after filling 2 buckets. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We have 40 cups of tea and we want to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 8 cups of tea (40/5 = 8). Now, there are 13 people including us, so we need to distribute these 8 cups among them. Therefore, each person will get 1 cup of tea (8/13 = 1).
Response:  We have 17 kukis in total and we gave away 14 to our friends. So, there are 3 more kukis left with us.
Response:  We have 12 cups of water and we want to know how many more cups will fit in the container after adding 16 cups of milk.  So, let's calculate the capacity of the container as follows:  Container Capacity = Water filled in the container / 12 (since there are 12 cups of water) = 100/12 = 8.33 cups  Now, if we add 16 cups of milk, the total volume of liquid inside the container will be: Total Volume = Milk + Water = 16 + 8.33 = 24.33 cups  Therefore, there are 24.33 more cups that can fit in the container after adding 16 cups of milk.
Response:  We have 22 good apples and 75 bad apples in total. Out of these, 15 good apples are rotten, so we have 5 bad apples left. Therefore, Paakolla has 54 rotten apples.
Response:  We have 9 good apples and 6 bad apples in one basket. If we transfer 36 good apples and 3 bad apples to another basket, how many bad apples will be left in the original basket? So, there are 3 bad apples left in the original basket.
Response:  We have 37 good apples and 11 kukis. After sharing equally among Tyan and his friends, Tyan gets 5 good apples and 2 kukis. Now, out of these 2 kukis, how many will Tyan get? Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 8 gods and 6 kukis are together in one place. So, we need to multiply 8 and 6.  Therefore, there will be 48 (8 x 6) places where they can be together. Now, we need to subtract the number of times 20 gods and 34 kukis are together from the total number of places. So, we need to subtract 48 - (20 + 34) = 14. Therefore, there will be 14 places where both 20 gods and 34 kukis are together.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 36 kukis (a unit of measurement for rice). Since we know that 1 cup of water is equivalent to 40 kukis, we can use this conversion factor to calculate the number of cups of water needed to fill up 36 kukis. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of cups of water = 36 kukis / 40 kukis per cup = 900 kukis
So there are 900 kukis in one cup of water."
Response:  We have 36 coins in total.  Our friend has 14 coins and we have 22 coins left. So, the number of coins that our friend has is 14. Now, let's calculate how many coins are left with us after giving 10 coins to our friend. So, the number of coins left with us is 22 - 10 = 12 coins. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We have 41 kukis with Paku and his friends. Out of them, 9 kukis are given to Paku's friend, leaving us with 32 kukis. Then, we add 18 more kukis that Paku gets, making it a total of 50 kukis. So, the answer is 50.
Response:  We have 6 cups of water in one container and we want to share it equally among 30 friends. So, each friend will get 2/3 cup of water (6/30) = 1/10 cup of water. Now, let's consider the remaining 5 cups of water left after sharing with the first group of 30 friends. We need to divide these 5 cups equally among another 23 friends. So, each friend will get 5/23 cup of water (5 x 4/9) = 1/7 cup of water. Therefore, the total number of cups of water that our friend will get is 1 + 1/7 = 8/7 cups.
Response:  We have 97 kukis and 34 good kukis. After sharing equally among all, each person will get 15 good kukis and 56 bad kukis. So, Paakolal got 15 good kukis.
Response:  We have 26 cards in total (14 good and 12 bad).  Out of these, we drew 9 good cards and 7 bad cards. So, the remaining number of good cards is 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 good cards left in the deck.
Response:  We have 39 gods and 6 kukis. Each god has 23 kukis and each kuki has 32 gods. So, in total, we have: 39 x 6 = 234 kukis. Therefore, there are 234 kukis for every 39 gods.
Response:  We have to find out how many gods and kukis are there in total.  From the first part of the question, we know that there are 40 gods and 25 kukis. So, the total number of entities is 40 + 25 = 65. Now, from the second part of the question, we know that there are 28 gods and 15 kukis. So, the total number of entities after this part is 65 (from the first part) + 28 = 93. Finally, we need to subtract the number of kukis from the total number of entities to get the number of gods remaining. Therefore, the number of gods left after the second part is 93 - 15 = 78 gods.
Response:  Gwen has $70 in her wallet and she spends $30 on something. Now she has $40 left. She then buys an item worth $5. So, Gwen spent a total of $30 + $5 = $35.
Response:  Gwen has $80 and spends $6. So, she has $74 left.
Response:  Gwen has $200 to spend and she buys two items worth $4 each. So, she spends $8 in total. Now, if she had spent $3 more than that, then she would have spent $11 ($8 + $3). Therefore, the amount of money Gwen has left after making the purchase is $192 ($200 - $11).
Response:  Gwen has $80 and she spends $4 on something. Now she has $76 left. She then gives $5 to her friend. So, now Gwen has $71 left. Then, she spends another $3 on something, so now she has $68 left. Therefore, the amount of money that Gwen has after all these transactions is $68.
Response:  Gwen has $30 to spend and she buys two items worth $6 each. So, she spends $12 in total. Now, if we subtract the amount spent ($12) from the initial amount given ($30), we get $18 left with Gwen.
Response:  Gwen has $50 and she spends $4 on something. Now she has $46 left. She then receives $7 as change. So, her new balance is $53 ($46 + $7).
Response:  Gwen has $50 and she spends $3 on a toy for her brother. Then, she has $47 left. She gives $2 to her mother as a gift. Now, Gwen has $45 left. If she spends $6 more, then she will have $39 left. So, the amount of money Gwen has after spending $6 is $39.
Response:  We have 9 bullets in total. If we take out 4 of them, then how many are left? So, there are 5 bullets left.
Response:  Josh has 21 bullets in his gun and he misses 12 of them. So, there are 9 bullets left in his gun.
Response:  Josh has 19 bullets in total and he fires 11 of them. So, he has 8 remaining bullets. Now, out of those 8 bullets, he fires 5 new ones, leaving him with 3 remaining bullets. Therefore, there are 3 gole (bullets) left after Josh fires his shots.
Response:  Josh has 4 bullets left and he fires 16 bullets in total. So, he fired 16 - 4 = 12 bullets remaining. Now, out of those 12 bullets, 8 are new and 4 are old. So, the number of old bullets is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Josh has 7 bullets in his gun and he fires 8 bullets. So, there are 15 bullets left in the gun (7 + 8 = 15).
Response:  We have to find out how many bullets are required for 21 targets in total. Since there are 7 bullets per magazine, we need to divide the number of targets by 7 to get the number of magazines required. So, the answer is: Number of magazines = Total targets / Bullets per magazine = 21 / 7 = 3 magazines.
"Response:  Josh has 20 bullets in his gun and he fires two shots. So now he has 18 bullets left. Then Jack takes one bullet from him, so Josh has 17 bullets left. Now let's calculate how many bullets are left with each of them: With Josh, there are 17 bullets left; With Jack, there is 1 bullet left."
Response:  Josh has 22 bullets in his gun and he misses 8 of them. So, he has 14 bullets left. Now, Jack takes away 20 bullets from Josh. So, Josh is left with 4 bullets.
Response:  We know that there are 11 bullets in Joshna's gun. If she fires 7 of them, how many bullets will be left in her gun? Therefore, out of 19 bullets, 11 - 7 = 4 bullets will remain in her gun. So, 4 bullets are left in Joshna's gun.
Response:  We have 22 bullets in total and we need to divide them equally among 13 people. So each person will get 22/13 = 1.69 bullets per person. Now, if there are 5 extra bullets left over after dividing them equally among 13 people, then each of those 5 people will get 22 - (13 x 1.69) = 0.71 bullets each.
Response:  We have 15 balls in total and we throw them equally among 9 friends. So each friend will get 1 ball. Now, out of these 9 friends, 2 are girls, so they will share their 1 ball between them, giving each girl 0.5 balls. Therefore, there are 15 - (9 x 1) - (2 x 0.5) = 7 balls left.
Response:  We have three bullets in one container and six bullets in another container. If we mix them together, there will be a total of 9 bullets (3 + 6 = 9). So, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  Marko has 4 pounds of steroids and Tyler has 19 pounds of steroids. To find out how much more or less Tyler has than Marko in terms of steroid weight, we need to subtract Marko's weight from Tyler's weight: 19 - 4 = 15 pounds So, Tyler has 15 pounds more steroids than Marko.
Response:  Marko has 35 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $10 each. He has 20 customers who are willing to buy these steroids at that price. Now, we need to calculate how much money Marko will make from selling these steroids. To do this, we multiply the number of steroids sold (20) with their cost per unit ($10). So, Marko will make $200 from selling these steroids. Now, let's consider Tyler's situation. Tyler also has 35 pounds of steroids but he wants to sell them for $13 each instead of $10. If he has 15 customers who want to buy these steroids at that price, then he will make $495 from selling those steroids. Comparing both situations, it is clear that Tyler will make more money than Marko. Therefore, the difference in weight between Marko's and Tyler's steroids is not equal to the amount of money they will make from selling them.
Response:  Marko has 20 pounds of steroids and he sells them to Tyler for $50 per pound. So, Tyler pays $50 x 20 = $1000 to buy all 20 pounds of steroids from Marko. Now, let's calculate how much weight each pound of steroids weighs in terms of gold. Since one pound of steroids costs $1000 / 20 pounds = $50 per pound of gold. Therefore, Marko gets $50 x 17 pounds = $850 worth of gold from Tyler.
Response:  Marko has 8 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $10 per pound. If Tyler buys all of Marko's steroids, then Tyler will have 32 pounds of steroids, which is equal to $320 (since each pound costs $10). So, if Marko sells his entire stock of steroids to Tyler, Marko will make $320 - $8 = $312 in profit.
Response:  Marko has 24 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $90 per pound. So, he will get $90 x 24 = $2160 from selling all his steroids. Now, he has to divide this amount among the 9 people who want to buy them. Therefore, each person will get $2160 / 9 = $240 per pound.
Response:  Marko has 36 pounds of strawberries and he wants to share them equally among his friends. Each friend will get 8 pounds of strawberries. So, the total weight of strawberries shared among all friends is 36 / 5 = 7.2 pounds per person. Now, let's calculate the number of strawberries each friend gets. Since there are 12 kilograms in a pound, we can convert the weight from pounds to kilograms as follows: 7.2 pounds x 12 kg/pound = 86.4 kilograms. Therefore, each friend gets 86.4 kilograms of strawberries.
Response:  Marko has 22 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $30 per pound. So, he will get $660 from selling all his steroids (22 x $30 = $660). Now, let's calculate how many pounds of steroids each of his friends can buy with that amount. If they want to buy 30 pounds of steroids, then they will have to pay $660 / 30 = $22 per pound. Therefore, each friend can buy 30/22 = 1.36 pounds of steroids.
Response:  Marko has 15 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $37 per pound. So, if we divide $37 by 15, we get the price of one pound of steroids = $2.46. Therefore, the weight of 10 pounds of steroids would be = $2.46 x 10 = $24.60.
Response:  Marko has 30 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $50 each. If one tablet costs $17, then how many tablets can he sell? Solution: To find out how many tablets Marko can sell, we need to divide the total weight of steroids (30 pounds) by the price of one tablet ($17). This gives us the number of tablets that Marko can sell: Number of tablets = Total weight of steroids / Price of one tablet = 30 pounds / $17 = 1767 tablets So, Marko can sell 1767 tablets of steroids.
Response:  Marko has 10 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $26 per pound. So, if he sells one pound of steroids, he will get $26. Now, let's calculate how many pounds of steroids he can sell to make $100. We know that 1 pound of steroids costs $26, so to find out how many pounds he can sell to make $100, we need to divide $100 by $26: $$ \frac {100}{26} = 4 $$ This means that Marko can sell 4 pounds of steroids to make $100.
Response:  Marko has 11 pounds of steroids and he wants to sell them for $30 per pound. So, if we divide $30 by 11 pounds, we get $2.73 per pound. Therefore, Marko's steroids cost $2.73 per pound.
Response:  We know that there are 10 bus stops in total.  Of these, 5 bus stops have two platforms each, and 5 bus stops have one platform each. So, the number of bus stops with at least one platform is 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore, out of the 10 bus stops, at least 10 have at least one platform.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and each letter has a corresponding number of milles (mula) in Marathi language. So, we can start counting from A to Z as follows:
A - 1 mule B - 2 mules C - 3 mules D - 4 mules E - 5 mules F - 6 mules G - 7 mules H - 8 mules I - 9 mules J - 10 mules K - 11 mules L - 12 mules M - 13 mules N - 14 mules O - 15 mules P - 16 mules Q - 17 mules R - 18 mules S - 19 mules T - 20 mules U - 21 mules V - 22 mules W - 23 mules X - 24 mules Y - 25 mules Z - 26 mules Therefore, the total number of mules in the English alphabet is 26 x 26 = 676 mules. Now, let's find out how many mules are there in the word ""STOP"". The word ""STOP"" contains 5 letters, so the number of mules in it is 5 x 26 = 130 mules. Finally, we need to subtract the number of mules in the word ""STOP"" from the total number of mules in the English alphabet to get the remaining mules. So, the answer to the question is: Remaining mules after removing the mules in the word ""STOP"" = Total number of mules in English alphabet - Number of mules in the word ""STOP"" = 676 - 130 = 546 mules"
Response:  We know that there are 41 bus stops in total.  Of these, 20 bus stops have two platforms each, and 21 bus stops have one platform each. So, the number of bus stops with at least one platform is 20 + 21 = 41. Therefore, the answer is 41.
"Response:  We know that there are 43 bus stops in total and out of them, 21 buses stop at some point. So, the number of buses that do not stop at any of the bus stops is:

Number of buses that do not stop at any bus stop = Total number of bus stops - Number of buses stopping at some bus stop
= 43 - 21
= 22
Therefore, 22 buses do not stop at any of the bus stops."
Response:  Basmadhye (Total distance) = 41 miles. Stoppage time per mile = 15 minutes (as given in the question). Now, let's calculate the total stoppage time: Total stoppage time = Bas madhye x Stoppage time per mile = 41 miles x 15 minutes/mile = 615 minutes Now, we need to find out how much of this time is spent at each stop. Let's assume that there are X stops in total. Time spent at each stop = Total stoppage time / Number of stops = 615 minutes / X stops = X minutes Now, we know that there are 18 stops in total. So, the time spent at each stop = 615 minutes / 18 stops = 34 minutes and 20 seconds per stop.
Response:  We know that there are 21 bus stops in total and 16 of them have only one bus stop at each location. So, we need to find out how many buses can go through these 16 bus stops simultaneously. To do this, we will use division.  Number of buses = Total number of bus stops / Number of bus stops with only one bus stop Each bus stop has only one bus, so the number of buses going through each bus stop is equal to 1. Therefore, the total number of buses going through all 16 bus stops simultaneously is:  Number of buses = 21 / 16 = 13/4 = 3.75 buses.  Since you cannot have a fraction of a bus, the final answer is 3 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 5 buses in total and each bus can carry 63 passengers. So, the total number of passengers that can be carried by all the buses is: 5 x 63 = 315 passengers. Now, we need to find out how many passengers are left after 14 buses have departed. To do this, we will subtract the number of passengers that have already departed (14) from the total number of passengers that can be carried (315): 315 - 14 = 291 passengers. Therefore, there are 291 passengers left after 14 buses have departed.
Response:  We know that there are 36 mules in total and 68 mules in the bus stop. Now, we need to find out how many mules will be left after 12 mules have been taken from the bus stop. To do this, we can divide the number of mules in the bus stop (68) by 12, which gives us 5. So, after taking 12 mules from the bus stop, there will be 5 mules left.
Response:  We know that there are 22 wheels in total and each wheel has 40 holes. So, the total number of holes is: 22 x 40 = 880 holes. Now, we need to find out how many holes are there in one bus wheel. Since there are 16 spokes in each wheel, the number of holes per spoke is: 880 / 16 = 56 holes per spoke. Therefore, the number of holes in one bus wheel is 56.
Response:  We know that there are 28 buses in total and they have to be distributed among 82 stops. So, each stop will get an average of 3 buses (28/82) = 0.35 buses per stop. Now, we need to find out how many buses will go to each stop if there are 30 stops in total. Therefore, the number of buses each stop will get is 0.35 x 30 = 10 buses.
"Response:  We know that there are 23 buses in total and each bus has 18 seats. So, the total number of passengers who can travel in all the buses is:

23 x 18 = 404

Now, let's consider the situation where 5 more buses are added to the fleet with each bus having 24 seats instead of 18 seats. The total number of passengers who can travel in these additional 5 buses is:

5 x 24 = 120

So, the total number of passengers who can travel in all the buses including the new ones is:

404 + 120 = 524

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 524."
Response:  We have to find out how many times 51 can be divided into 133 without leaving any remainder. To do this, we need to divide 133 by 51 and see if there is any remainder left. So, 133 / 51 = 2 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, the number of times 51 can be divided into 133 without leaving any remainder is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many coins are there in total and then calculate the number of coins that are left after taking 13 coins from the pile of 54 coins. So, let's start with the calculation: Total number of coins = 54 Coins taken = 13 Coins remaining =? To find the number of coins remaining, we need to subtract the number of coins taken (13) from the total number of coins (54). Therefore, the number of coins remaining is : Number of coins remaining = 54 - 13 = 41 coins.
Response:  We have to find out how many coins are there in total and then calculate the number of coins that BeKaRNe has given away.  So, let's start with the information provided in the question:  Total number of coins = 145 vikale (coins) Number of coins given away by BeKaRNe = 72 keke (coins) Now, we need to find out how many coins BeKaRNe gave away per person. To do this, we divide the number of coins given away by BeKaRNe by the total number of people who received coins: Number of coins given away per person = 72 keke / 145 vikale = 0.5 (or half) Now, if each person received 0.5 coins from BeKaRNe, then the total number of coins BeKaRNe gave away is equal to the number of people who received coins multiplied by the number of coins they received: Total number of coins given away by BeKaRNe = Number of people x Number of coins received Per person = 145 vikale x 0.5 = 72.5 coins Therefore, BeKaRNe gave away 72.5 coins.
Response: 155 friends shared Rs. 140 among themselves equally. Now, each friend will get Rs. 925 (Rs. 140 / 155). But since Bekar is not sharing anything, he will get Rs. 140 - Rs. 925 = Rs. 485.
Response: 121 x 105 = 12650 (the product of 121 and 105) Now we need to subtract 170 from this result: 12650 - 170 = 12480 So there are 12480 keys left after 170 new keys were added.
Response: 13 bees made 91 boxes and filled them with 154 new keys each. So, how many keys did each box contain? We need to divide the total number of keys (154) by the number of boxes (91). Therefore, each box contained 167 keys (154 / 91 = 167).
Response:  We have to find out how many times 170 is divided by 78 and then calculate the remainder. So, we divide 170 by 78: 170 / 78 = 2.  There are two remainders left after dividing 170 by 78. Therefore, there will be 2 new keys made from each of these remainders.
Response:  We have to find out how many coins are there in total and then calculate the number of coins that are left after giving away 110 coins. So, let's start with the given information:  There are 110 coins initially.  After giving away 75 coins, there are 35 coins left. Now, we need to find out how many coins were originally there. To do this, we can use the fact that if there were x coins initially, then after giving away y coins, there will be x - y coins left. In this case, we know that x = 110 (the initial number of coins) and y = 75 (the number of coins given away). So, we can set up the equation: x - y = 35. Solving for x, we get: x = 145. Therefore, there were 145 coins originally.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 144 is divided into 71 and what remains after that. So, we divide 144 by 71: 144 / 71 = 2.
Now, we subtract the result from 144: 144 - (2 x 71) = 113. Therefore, there are 113 remaining pieces of cake after dividing 144 pieces among 71 people."
Response:  We have 149 beads and 91 pebbles. If we take 10 beads and 90 pebbles, then we will have 139 beads left (149 - 10 = 139) and 81 pebbles left (91 - 90 = 81). So, there are 139 beads and 81 pebbles remaining after taking 10 beads and 90 pebbles.
Response:  We have 7 cows and 148 posts. If we take 15 cows and 103 posts away from us, how many posts will be left with us? So, the answer is 103 posts.
Response:  We have to find out how many keys and posts are required for each of the two groups.  For Group A, we need 126 keys and 48 posts, so we can calculate the number of keys per post as follows: Number of keys / Number of posts = 126/48 = 2.5keys/post Now, let's assume that we want to divide these keys into equal parts of 3 keys each (since we cannot have fractional keys). So, we will have 2.5 keys per post x 3 keys/post = 7 keys per post Therefore, for Group A, we require 126 keys and 48 posts, which means there are 7 keys per post.  Similarly, for Group B, we need 81 keys and 32 posts, so we can calculate the number of keys per post as follows: Number of keys / Number of posts = 81/32 = 2.5 keys/post Again, let's assume that we want to divide these keys into equal parts of 3 keys each, so we will have 2.5 keys per post x 3 keys/post = 7.5 keys per post Therefore, for Group B, we require 81 keys and 32 posts, which means there are 7.5 keys per post.
Response:  We have 19 cows and 131 pests. If we kill all the pests, how many more pests will there be than cows? So, the number of additional pests = Number of pests - Number of cows = 131 - 19 = 112 pests. Therefore, there will be 112 additional pests if we kill all the pests.
Response:  We have to find out how many more posts are required to fill up the vacancies of 157 candidates and 169 posts.  So, we need to subtract the number of filled-up posts from the total number of vacancies.  Therefore, the difference between 157 (filled-up posts) and 169 (total vacancies) is 12 (answer).
Response:  We have to find out how many more posts are required to fill up the vacancies of 54 candidates and 143 posts.  So, we need to subtract the number of filled-up posts from the total number of vacancies.  Therefore, the difference between 68 (filled-up posts) and 143 (total vacancies) is 75.  Hence, there are 75 additional posts that need to be filled up.
Response:  If there are 44 keys in total and we have already used 26 of them (as given in the question), then the remaining keys are 18. So, out of these 18 keys, if 4 are taken away, then the remaining number of keys is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 80 cents can be divided into 40 cents. So, we need to divide 80 by 40.  When we divide 80 by 40, we get 2 with remainder 16. Therefore, there are 16 ways in which 80 cents can be divided into 40 cents.
Response:  The bees have collected 137 kek (units) of honey from their friend's tree. If they had collected 169 kek more than that, then they would have collected a total of 306 kek (137 + 169 = 306). So, the number of kek that the bees did not collect is 306 - 137 = 169 kek.
Response:  We have to find out how many coins are left after 103 new coins were added and 86 old coins were removed.  So, we need to subtract 86 from 103.  Therefore, there are 17 coins left (103 - 86 = 17).
Response:  We have to find out how many coins were there initially and then calculate how many coins are left after some of them got broken or lost.  Initially, we had 99 coins.  Of these, 167 new coins were added, leaving us with 89 coins less than the initial amount. So, the final number of coins is:  Initial coins = 99 Coins added = 167 New coins = 89 Coins lost = 89 - 167 = -78 Coins remaining = 99 - 78 = 21 Coins
Response: 8 beakers of water are filled with 139 new coins and 145 old coins. How many coins will there be in total if all the beakers are emptied together?
Response:  We are given that 62 keys were taken from Becker and he had 149 keys in total. So, the number of keys left with Becker is 149 - 62 = 87 keys. Now, we are asked how many keys were taken by Tyagi. Since Tyagi took 144 keys, the number of keys remaining with him is 87 - 144 = -59 keys. Therefore, the correct answer is -59 keys.
Response:  We have to find out how many coins were there initially and then calculate how many coins are left after each transaction.  Initially, there were 81 coins. In the first transaction, 92 coins were taken away, leaving us with 46 coins. Now let's calculate how many coins are left after each subsequent transaction:  Transaction 1: -92 coins = -46 coins + 0 coins = -46 coins  Transaction 2: -46 coins x 4 = -184 coins + 0 coins = -184 coins  Transaction 3: -184 coins x 5 = -920 coins + 0 coins = -920 coins  Therefore, after all three transactions, we have -920 coins remaining.
Response:  We have 61 beakers and 167 cups. If we fill each cup with 108 keys and use 44 pastries as weights, then... (Note: I will not provide the exact calculation here as it is beyond the scope of this platform.)
Response:  We have 56 beakers and we need to fill them with 124 ml of water each. So, in total, we need 6760 ml of water (56 x 124 = 6760). Now, let's assume that there are 104 pieces of pasta left after filling all the beakers with water. Therefore, the number of pieces of pasta that can fit in one beaker is: Number of pieces of pasta per beaker = Total number of pieces of pasta / Number of beakers = 104 / 56 = 1.85 pieces of pasta per beaker.
Response:  We have to find out how many beakers and test tubes are required for each reaction.  For Reaction 52, we need 3 beakers and 8 test tubes.  For Reaction 84, we need 4 beakers and 16 test tubes.  Therefore, in total, we require 3 + 4 = 7 beakers and 8 + 16 = 24 test tubes.
Response:  We have 134 beads and 11 keys. If we use each key to unlock 10 locks, then we will need 11 x 10 = 110 keys. Now, if we use these 110 keys to open all the locks, we will have 134 - 110 = 24 locks left. So, there are 24 additional locks that can be opened using the remaining keys.
Response:  We have to find out how many beads are left after removing 14 beads and then finding out how many beads are left after removing 8 more beads. So, total number of beads = 153 - 14 = 139 beads. Now, we need to remove 8 more beads from this remaining amount, so total number of beads left = 139 - 8 = 131 beads.
Response:  We have to find out how many more keys are required to make 154 keys and 78 keys in total.  So, we need to subtract the number of keys available from the total number of keys needed.  In this case, we need 76 more keys (154 - 78 = 76). Therefore, the answer is 76 additional keys are required.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 games in total and each game has 140 moves. So, to calculate the total number of moves in all 22 games, we can multiply the number of games with the number of moves in each game. Therefore, the total number of moves in all 22 games is:

Total Number of Moves = Number of Games x Number of Moves per Game
= 22 x 140
= 3080

So, there are approximately 3080 moves in all 22 games combined."
Response:  We know that there are 106 games in total. If we divide it by 64, then... (drumroll)...we get 1.63 games left! Yes, only 1 game is left after dividing 106 games by 64.

Response:  We have 20 non-tennis games and 70 tennis games. To find out how many non-tennis games are in 12 units of 4 games each, we can divide 20 by 4 to get 5. So, there are 5 non-tennis games in each unit of 12 games.
Response:  We have 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sonic games. To find out how many Sonic games are in each group of 31 games, we need to divide the total number of Sonic games (132) by 31. So, there are 4 Sonic games in each group of 31 games.
"Response:  We know that there are 80 games in total and Tilak has played 31 of them. So, the number of games left for Tilak to play is:

Number of games left = Total number of games - Number of games played by Tilak
= 80 - 31
= 49

So, out of the remaining 49 games, Tilak has played 6 games so far. Therefore, the number of games left for him to play is:

Number of games left = Remaining games - Games played by Tilak
= 49 - 6
= 43

Answer: There are 43 games left for Tilak to play."
Response:  We have 52 boxes and we need to fill them with 38 blocks each. So, in total, we will need 38 x 52 = 1964 blocks.
Response:  We have 97 blocks and we need to find out how many blocks can be placed in each row. Since there are 72 blocks in total, we will divide them equally among the rows. So, each row will have 72/9 = 8 blocks. Therefore, the number of rows that can fit in one block is 97 / 8 = 12.
Response:  We know that there are 79 blocks in total and we have to find out how many blocks are left after 14 blocks are taken for the tower and 11 blocks are taken for the house.  So, the number of blocks left = Total blocks - (Taken for tower + Taken for house)  = 79 - (14 + 11)  = 54 blocks are left.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each of the two structures - tower and house.  For the tower, we need 27 blocks to build it, as mentioned in the question.  Now, let's calculate the number of blocks needed for the house. Since the house is described as being built with 53 blocks, we can conclude that one block is equal to approximately 0.69 blocks (53 / 78 = 0.69). So, to build the house, we will need approximately 53 x 0.69 = 36.43 blocks. Therefore, the total number of blocks required to build both the tower and the house is 27 + 36.43 = 63.43 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randiq has 37 blocks and he wants to distribute them equally among his friends. So, if we divide 37 blocks into 13 groups of 2 or 3 blocks each, then each group will have 2 or 3 blocks. Now, let's calculate how many blocks Randiq can give to each friend. If he gives 2 blocks to each friend in a group of 2 blocks, then he will give a total of 2 x 13 = 26 blocks to his friends. Similarly, if he gives 3 blocks to each friend in a group of 3 blocks, then he will give a total of 3 x 13 = 39 blocks to his friends. Therefore, Randiq can give either 26 or 39 blocks to his friends depending on whether he divides the blocks into groups of 2 or 3 blocks each.
Response:  We know that Randiq has 86 blocks and wants to build a tower with them. If he builds each block at a height of $h$ blocks, then the total height of the tower will be: $\text{Height} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} h \cdot i$, where $n$ is the number of blocks used in the tower. Since Randiq uses 79 blocks for the tower, we have: $\text{Height} = 79 \cdot h$. Now, if he wants to make the tower taller by one more block, he needs to add it at a height of $h+1$ blocks above the previous top block. Therefore, the new height of the tower will be: $\text{New Height} = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (h+1) \cdot i = (n+1) \cdot (h+1)$. So, the difference between the old and new heights is: $\text{Difference} = \text{New Height} - \text{Height} = (n+1) \cdot (h+1) - 79 \cdot h$. Since $n = 79$, $h = 82$, and $Randiq$ wants to make the tower taller by one more block, we have: $\text{Difference} = 30$.
Response:  We know that Randi has 36 blocks and he wants to make a tower. So, we need to find out how many blocks are left after building the tower. Accordingly, if Randi builds a tower of 59 blocks, then there will be 21 blocks remaining (59 - 36 = 21).
Response:  We know that Ranidiked has 95 blocks and needs to build a house with 20 blocks and a tower with 50 blocks. So, we have used up 75 blocks (20 + 50) already. Therefore, if we want to calculate how many more blocks are needed for the tower, we can subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks available, which is 95 - 75 = 20 blocks.
Response:  We have 89 blocks available for building a house and we can build 63 blocks of wall using those 89 blocks. So, to find out how many more blocks are required to build the remaining part of the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used in building the wall from the total number of blocks available. Therefore, the difference between 89 and 63 is equal to 26. Hence, there are 26 additional blocks required to complete the tower.
Response:  We are given that there are 20 books in total and we have to choose 5 of them. So, the number of options is 20. Now, we are asked how many of these 5 options are written by Atul. Therefore, the probability of an option being written by Atul is 5/20 or 1/4.

"Response:  We know that there are 22 books and 10 pictures in total. Now, we need to find out how many books and pictures each person has seen. To do this, we can divide the total number of books and pictures by the number of people. So, if 12 people have seen 56 books and pictures, then each person has seen an average of:

Books: (12 x 56) / 12 = 4.5 books
Pictures: (12 x 56) / 12 = 4.5 pictures
Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, each person has seen approximately 4.5 books and 4.5 pictures."
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 paintings. So, in total, there are 4 + 17 = 21 items. Now, we need to find out how many of these items are chitrapathis (paintings). Since we have already mentioned that there are 7 chitrapatlis, so among the 21 items, 7 are chitrapatis. Therefore, the answer is 7.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies based on the theme of ""Wedding Wedding Shaale"". So, if we want to find out how many times the word ""wedding"" appears in these sources, we need to count the number of instances where the word ""wedding"" is used in each book or movie.  For example, if we look at one of the books, it may have the word ""wedding"" used 5 times within its pages. Similarly, one of the movies may use the word ""wedding"" 7 times during its runtime. Therefore, the total number of times the word ""wedding"" appears in all 16 books and 14 movies would be:  Total number of instances of the word ""wedding"": = Number of instances of the word ""wedding"" in each book x 16 + Number of instances of the word ""wedding"" in each movie x 14"
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 paintings in total. Now, we need to find out how many paintings are of ""Wedding Wedding Shaale"" based on the information given in the question. From the question, we can see that 19 books are related to ""Wedding Wedding Shaale"", which means that among the 61 paintings, at least 19 must be of this topic. So, the number of paintings of ""Wedding Wedding Shaale"" is:  Number of paintings = Total number of paintings x Percentage of paintings related to ""Wedding Wedding Shaale""  Number of paintings = 61 x 19/80 = 12 Therefore, there are 12 paintings of ""Wedding Wedding Shaale""."
Response:  The owner of the bookstore has 10 books and 11 paintings. If you buy 3 books and 2 paintings from him, how many books will he have left?  So, the number of books left with the owner after selling them to you is 7 (10 - 3 = 7). Similarly, if you buy 12 paintings from him, how many paintings will he have left? Therefore, the number of paintings left with the owner after selling them to you is 9 (11 - 12 = -1).
Response:  The owner of 11 books and 17 paintings has read 7 books and watched 21 movies. So, among the 11 books he owns, he has read 7/11 = 0.63 (approximately) books. Similarly, among the 17 paintings he owns, he has watched 21/17 = 1.24 (approximately) movies.
Response:  We are given that there are 8 books written by Mallikarjun Kulkarni and we have to find out how many of them are about Veeda Vaada Shaale. So, let's assume that among these 8 books, X number of books are about Veeda Vaada Shaale. Now, we know that each book contains 14 verses, so the total number of verses in all the books about Veeda Vaada Shaale is X x 14. Therefore, the answer is X x 14.
Response:  We know that there are 62 books and 19 book covers in total. Now, we need to find out how many books each of the four people has read.  For person A, since they have read 4 books, their remaining books are 62 - 4 = 58. Similarly, for person B, since they have read 34 books, their remaining books are 62 - 34 = 28.  For person C, since they have read 40 books, their remaining books are 62 - 40 = 22. And for person D, since they have read 30 books, their remaining books are 62 - 30 = 32. Therefore, the number of books left with each of them is as follows: Person A - 58 books, Person B - 28 books, Person C - 22 books, and Person D - 32 books.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 21 paintings. So, in total, there are 8 + 21 = 29 items. Now, we need to find out how many of these items belong to the owner. From the question, we know that the owner has 7 books and 4 paintings. Therefore, the number of items belonging to the owner is 7 + 4 = 11. So, out of the total 29 items, 11 belong to the owner.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 books and 15 movies related to ""Wedding Wedding Shaale"" (Marriage Marriage in English). So, if we have read 11 books and watched 40 movies of this topic, then we have seen a total of:

Response:  Devika has 7 tickets and she wants to distribute them equally among her 4 friends. So, each friend will get 1 ticket. Now, out of the remaining 3 tickets, Devika has 2 tickets left with her. Therefore, the number of tickets that Devika distributed is 2.
Response:  We know that there are 12 tickets in total and Devyani has already taken 10 of them. So, there are only 2 tickets left for her to take. Now, we need to find out how many tickets each of the other two people will get. Since they have already taken 7 tickets between them, they will get 5 tickets each. Therefore, the final distribution is: Devyani - 2 tickets, Rohan - 5 tickets, and Aishwarya - 5 tickets.
Response:  Devika has Rs.180 in her purse and spends Rs.50 on a gift for her friend. She then buys a pair of shoes worth Rs.110. How many tickets can she buy with the remaining amount of Rs.220? Solution: Now, we have Rs.220 left after purchasing the gift, shoes, and paying for them. So, Devika can buy tickets equal to Rs.220 / Rs.10 = 22 tickets. Therefore, the answer is 22 tickets.
Response:  Devika has Rs 1900 in her account and she spends Rs 1200 on clothes. So, she is left with Rs 700. Now, she buys a ticket worth Rs 350. So, her balance amount after purchasing the ticket will be Rs 350 - Rs 700 = Rs (-) 350. Therefore, Devika's current balance amount is Rs (-) 350.
Response:  Devika has 13 tickets and she spends Rs 800 on them. She also spends Rs 1800 on clothes. So, her total expenditure is Rs 800 + Rs 1800 = Rs 2600. Now, if she wants to buy more tickets, she will have to spend money from her remaining balance of Rs 2600 - Rs 800 = Rs 1800. Therefore, she can afford to buy 18 tickets (Rs 1800 / Rs 100 = 18).
Response:  We have 14 tickets at Rs. 10 each and 2 tickets at Rs. 50 each. So, in total we have spent Rs. 14 x 10 = Rs. 140 + Rs. 50 x 2 = Rs. 100 = Rs. 240. Therefore, Devika has spent Rs. 240 for 16 tickets (14 x 10 + 2 x 50).
Response:  We know that Helena has 14 trees and each tree produces 9 fruits per year. So, in total, she will have 14 x 9 = 126 fruits per year. Now, we are asked how many fruits Jaya will get if she takes 50 fruits from Helena. To find out, we need to subtract the number of fruits Jaya takes (50) from the total number of fruits Helena has (126). Therefore, Jaya will get 126 - 50 = 76 fruits per year.
Response:  We are given that Hallie has 13 trees and each tree can produce 6 melons in an year. So, total number of melons produced by all the trees = Number of trees x Number of melons produced per tree per year = 13 x 6 = 78 melons. Therefore, there are 78 melons grown by Hallie.
Response:  We know that Helena has 20 stones and she gives 4 of them to her friend. So, now Helena has 16 stones left (20 - 4 = 16). Now, we are asked how many stones Melia has after receiving 3 stones from Helena. Therefore, the number of stones Melia has is 16 + 3 = 19 stones.
Response:  We have to find out how many trees are left after cutting down 12 trees from a forest of 50 trees. So, we need to calculate (50 - 12) = 38 trees remaining in the forest.
Response:  We have to find out how many trees are left after cutting 4 big trees and then finding out how many more trees are needed to make up for the loss of those 4 big trees.  So, let's first calculate the number of big trees that can be cut: 4 big trees x 5 small trees per big tree = 20 small trees. Now we need to find out how many small trees are left after cutting 4 big trees: 20 small trees - 4 big trees = 16 small trees. Therefore, there are 16 small trees left after cutting 4 big trees.
Response:  We have two mountains with heights of 1200 m and 900 m respectively. If we want to find out how many hills (with height less than or equal to 1200 m) can be seen from one mountain, we need to use some basic geometry.  The formula for calculating the visible distance is given below:  Visible Distance = Hypotenuse of right triangle formed by Mountain A and observer's location x Height of Mountain B  In this case, Mountain A has a height of 1200 m, and Mountain B has a height of 900 m. So, let's draw a right triangle as shown in the figure:  Now, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse (visible distance). Using Pythagoras theorem, we get:  Visible Distance = sqrt(900^2 + 1200^2) = sqrt(810,000 + 144,000) = sqrt(954,000) = 307.6 meters Therefore, there are 307.6 meters of hill that can be seen from one mountain.
Response:  We have 13 trees and we need to find out how many of them will be destroyed if 3 of them are cut down. So, the number of trees that will be left is: 13 - 3 = 10. Therefore, 10 trees will be left after cutting down 3 trees.
Response:  We have two mountains A and B with heights of 1000 m and 500 m respectively. If we draw an imaginary line connecting the top points of both mountains, it will form a circular arc. Now, let's consider that this circular arc has a radius of 200 m ( half the distance between the two mountains). The area of this circle is given by Area = πr^2, where r is the radius. In our case, r = 200 m. So, the area of the circular arc is: Area = π(200)^2 = 4000 square meters. Since there are 11 hills in total, each hill covers an area of 4000/11 = 363.64 square meters. Therefore, if all 11 hills were to be covered by the circular arc, then each hill would cover approximately 363.64 square meters.
Response:  Santra is equal to 66, and each santra has 28 days. So, in total, there are 66 x 28 = 1744 days in a year. Now, we need to find out how many days are left after subtracting 28 days from 1744 days. Therefore, the answer is 1744 - 28 = 1716 days.
Response:  We know that Santra is a female name and there are 365 days in a year. So, if Santra has to take care of 24 pishwas (babies) every day, then she will have to do it for 1.37 years (365 x 24 = 8,760 days).
Response:  Santra (Santosh) has been working for 4 years and 6 months at Pikachai Company. In total, he worked for 56 months.
Response:  We know that there are 38 fish in the pond and each fish can eat 42 insects per day. So, in total, 38 x 42 = 1608 insects will be eaten by all the fish in one day. Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for all the fish to eat up all the insects in the pond. To do this, we divide the total number of insects (1608) by the number of fish (38). This gives us an average time period of 42 days. Therefore, it will take approximately 42 days for all the fish in the pond to eat up all the insects.
Response:  We know that Santra is equal to 66 and each Santra has 25 days. So, in total, there are 66 x 25 = 1600 days in a year. Now, we need to find out how many Santre are present in 87 days. To do this, we divide the number of days by the number of Santre per day: 1600 days / 25 days/Santra = 64 Santre. Therefore, there are 64 Santre in 87 days.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total number of hours in a week is 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Santra takes to complete his work. According to the question, Santra completes his work in 35 hours per day. Therefore, total number of hours he takes to complete his work is 35 hours/day x 7 days/week = 245 hours.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 pious women (Santras) and each of them has to give away their wealth for 57 days in a year. So, the total number of days they have to give away their wealth is:

16 x 57 = 908 days

Now, we need to find out how many days each Santra has to give away her wealth in a year. Since there are 80 Santras, the total number of days they have to give away their wealth is:

80 x 908 = 72,720 days

So, each Santra has to give away her wealth for approximately 908 days in a year."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 fish in total and each fish takes up 12 square feet of space. So, the total area covered by all the fish is:

Area = Number of fish x Area per fish
= 67 x 12
= 794 square feet
Now, we need to find out how many squares of size 3x3 feet can fit inside this area. To do this, we divide the total area by the area of one square (which is 9 square feet):

Number of squares = Total area / Area of one square
= 794 / 9
= 88 squares
So, there can be approximately 88 squares of size 3x3 feet inside the water where the fish are swimming."
Response:  Santra (Santosh) has 74 paisas and he gives 71 paisas to someone else. So, after giving money, he is left with 3 paisas. Now, if we calculate for 51 days, then he will have 157 paisas (3 x 51 = 157).
Response:  Santra is equal to 76 and Pishwya is equal to 50. So, if we divide Santra by Pishwya, we get:  Santra / Pishwya = 76 / 50 = 1.52. Therefore, there are approximately 1.52 times more Santra than Pishwya.
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in a month and 52 weeks in a year. So, if Santra has been working for 2 years, then she has worked for 104 weeks (2 x 52). Now, let's calculate how many hours she has worked in those 104 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so she has worked for 104 / 7 = 15 weeks of 7 days each, which is equal to 104 days. And finally, we have to convert these 104 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 104 days x 24 hours/day = 2536 hours. Therefore, Santra has worked for approximately 2536 hours in the last 2 years.
Response:  We are given that Santra has 82 pink and 61 blue balls. After playing pickle for 25 days, how many balls will Santra have left?  To find out, we need to calculate the number of balls Santra picked up each day and then add it to the total number of balls she had initially.  So, on Day 1, Santra picked up 0 balls (since she didn't play pickle yet), but on Day 2, she picked up 25 balls ( since she played pickle for the first time). Therefore, on Day 2, Santra had 82 + 25 = 107 balls in total. Similarly, on Day 3, she picked up 25 more balls, so now she has 107 + 25 = 132 balls. And so on... By this logic, after 25 days, Santra would have 82 + 25 x 24 = 397 balls in total!
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and 24 days in April. So, if we subtract the number of days in April from the total number of days in March, we get: 31 - 24 = 7 days. Therefore, during these 7 days, Santra will have to perform 7 x 31 = 217 prayers.
Response:  Santra is given 44 paisa and he has to distribute it among 25 people equally. So, each person will get  $\boxed{\frac{44}{25}} = \boxed{1}$ paisa. Now, there are 4 more people than the number of paisas distributed, so each additional person will get $\boxed{\frac{4}{4}} = \boxed{1}$ paisa. Therefore, the total amount of money that Santra has to distribute is $\boxed{44 + 4} = \boxed{48}$ paisa.
Response:  Santra has 54 paisa coins and wants to give an equal amount of money to each of his 7 friends. So, he will have to distribute 54 / 7 = 7.86 paisas per friend. Since there are 7 friends, Santra will have to give a total of 7.86 x 7 = 53.92 paisas to all his friends together.
Response:  Santra is 54 years old and has 18 grandchildren. If she gives away Rs 10,000 to each of her 5 grandchildren every year, then in total, she will give away Rs 10 x 5 = Rs 50,000 per year. Since she has 18 grandchildren, she will be giving away Rs 50,000 / 18 = Rs 2777 per month. Therefore, Santra will have Rs 2777 x 12 = Rs 33,324 left after giving away Rs 10,000 to each of her 5 grandchildren for 12 months.
Response:  Santra is pregnant for 9 months, and she gives birth to a baby after that. So, the total time from conception to delivery is 9 months + 1 month (for gestation period) = 10 months. Therefore, there are 10 months between when Santra conceived and delivered her baby.
Response:  We know that Santra is a female name and there are 25 females in the group of 73 days. So, out of every 3 males, one is a female (i.e., 1/3). Therefore, the number of females who were picked up during these 73 days is:  Number of females = Total number of people x Female ratio  Number of females = 73 x 1/3 = 24.67  Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, let's round off the answer to 25 females.
"Response:  We know that Santra is a male and he has 65% of his father's genes and 35% of his mother's genes.  So, we can calculate the percentage of genes from each parent as follows:
Father's genes = (100 - 65%) x 100 = 35%
Mother's genes = (100 - 35%) x 100 = 65%
Now, let's consider how many days have passed since Santra was born. If it took 65 days for him to grow to be 65% of his father's height, then it will take approximately 46 days for him to reach 75% of his father's height (since 65 + 19 = 84). Therefore, after 65 days, Santra would be approximately 65% of his father's height, and after 46 days, he would be approximately 75% of his father's height."
Response:  We know that Santra has 41 more paisa than Paripakva Sanstha. So, Santra has 86 + 41 = 127 paisa. Therefore, the answer is 127.
Response:  We know that Santra has 71 paripakva and 60 aparipakva santas. If we calculate the total number of narangi peksha (nuts) required for each sant, then it will be: Total number of narangi peksha = Number of paripakva santas x Number of nuts per sant + Number of aparipakva santas x Number of nuts per sant Now, let's calculate the total number of narangi peksha required: Total number of narangi peksha = 71 x 4 + 60 x 3 = 284 + 180 = 464 narangi peksha Therefore, there are more than 464 narangi peksha required to fill all the santas equally.
Response:  Jessica has 12 feet in length and 11 feet in width. To find out how long the rectangle is, we need to multiply the length by the width. So, the area of the rectangle is: Area = Length x Width = 12 x 11 = 132 square feet Now, we are asked how many feet the rectangle is wide. Since the area is given as 132 square feet, and there are 9 square feet in a foot, we can convert the area to feet by dividing it by 9: Feet = Area / 9 = 132 / 9 = 14.67 feet Therefore, the rectangle is approximately 14.67 feet wide.
Response:  Jessica is 7 feet tall and her torso is 14 inches long. To find out how many times her torso can wrap around her legs, we need to divide the length of her torso by the circumference of her leg. So, let C be the circumference of her leg and T be the length of her torso. We are given that C = 32 inches and T = 14 inches. Therefore, we have: C = π × r, where r is the radius of her leg. Since she is 7 feet tall, her radius is half of her height, or 3.5 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot). Now we can calculate the circumference of her leg as follows: C = π × 3.5 = 10.68 inches. Next, we divide the length of her torso by the circumference of her leg to get an estimate of how many times it can wrap around her legs: T / C = 14 / 10.68 = approximately 13.3 times. So, Jessica's torso can wrap around her legs approximately 13.3 times.
Response:  Jessica has 7 feet in length and her waist is 14 inches wide. To find out how many times she can wrap herself around a cylindrical object with an diameter of 3 feet (which is equal to 36 inches), we need to divide her waist size by the diameter of the object. So,  Jessica can wrap herself around the object approximately 36 / 14 = 2.5 times. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Jessica has 11 feet in length and 15 feet in width. If we draw an imaginary line from one end of her to the other, it will be 16 chaurasi (a unit of measurement equal to 4 inches) long. Now, if we want to calculate how many carpets she can cover with that much fabric, we need to divide the total length of the fabric by the length of each carpet. So, let's assume each carpet is 3 feet long, which means Jessica can cover 5 carpets entirely with the fabric she has (16 x 3 = 48).
Response:  We have two trays of different sizes - one is 2 feet long and 12 inches wide, while the other is 3 feet long and 8 inches wide. If we want to fill each tray with soil so that it is completely full without any empty space, how many bags of soil will we need?  To find out, let's calculate the volume of each tray in cubic feet (ft³) using its length and width. For the first tray, the volume is 2 x 12 = 24 ft³. For the second tray, the volume is 3 x 8 = 24 ft³. Now, since we want to fill each tray completely without any empty space, we need to divide the total volume of both trays by the volume of a single bag of soil. Let's assume that a single bag of soil has a volume of 4 cubic feet (ft³). Therefore, the number of bags of soil needed to fill both trays completely is: Total volume of both trays / Volume of a single bag of soil = 24 + 24 = 48 ft³ / 4 = 12 bags of soil. So, we would need 12 bags of soil to fill both trays completely without any empty space.
Response:  The length of Jessica's hair is 19 feet and its width is 18 feet. If we want to know how many carpets can be made from her hair, we need to calculate the area of each carpet. Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 327 square feet Now, if we divide the total area of the hair (327 square feet) by the area of one carpet (20 square feet), we get the number of carpets that can be made from Jessica's hair: Number of carpets = Total area / Area of one carpet = 327 / 20 = 16.35 carpets So, approximately 16-17 carpets can be made from Jessica's hair.
Response:  Jessica has 19 feet in length and 20 feet in height. So, if we calculate the perimeter of each part separately, we get: Perimeter of length = 4 x 19 = 76 feet Perimeter of height = 2 x 20 = 40 feet Now, let's add both parts together to find out the total perimeter: Total perimeter = Perimeter of length + Perimeter of height = 76 + 40 = 116 feet Therefore, the perimeter of Jessica's body is 116 feet.
Response:  Jessica has 10 chairs and each chair takes up 5 feet of space. So, in total, Jessica has taken up 50 feet of space (10 chairs x 5 feet per chair). Now, if she wants to fit her carpet that is 6 feet wide, how much space will be left for it? The remaining space after fitting the carpet will be 40 feet (6 feet width - 50 feet used space).
Response:  Jessica has 10 chairs and each chair takes up an area of 2 square feet. So, the total area taken up by all the chairs is 20 square feet (10 chairs x 2 square feet per chair). Now, we need to find out how long Jessica's hole is. If it takes 2 feet of carpet for every foot of hole, then the length of the hole is 5 feet (2 feet x 5 holes = 10 square feet). Therefore, the length of Jessica's hole is 5 feet.
Response:  We have to find out how many carpets will fit in a room of length 4 feet and width 20 feet. To do this, we need to divide the total area of the room (length x width) into the area of each carpet (width x length). So, the number of carpets that can fit in the room is: Number of carpets = Total area of room / Area of one carpet = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet / 9 square feet = 9 carpets Now, there are 9 carpets that can fit in the room.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold in each store is 230. Since there are 5 stores, the total number of T-shirts sold across all stores is 230 x 5 = 1,150 T-shirts. Now, we need to calculate the percentage of T-shirts sold by each store. To do this, we will divide the number of T-shirts sold by the total number of T-shirts available (which is 230). So, for Store A, the percentage of T-shirts sold is (230/230) x 100% = 100%. Similarly, for Store B, the percentage of T-shirts sold is (230/230) x 100% = 100%, and so on. Therefore, out of 1,150 T-shirts sold, 500 T-shirts were sold by Store A, 270 T-shirts were sold by Store B, 80 T-shirts were sold by Store C, 40 T-shirts were sold by Store D, and 30 T-shirts were sold by Store E.
"Response:  The total cost of three t-shirts is $51. Since each t-shirt costs $17, we can write:

$51 = 3 × $17

Therefore, the cost of one t-shirt is $17."
Response:  The total number of t-shirts available in each batch is 87. If there are 47 t-shirts in each batch for Arkansas and Texas, then the total number of t-shirts available in both states together would be 47 x 2 = 94 t-shirts. Now, if we subtract the number of t-shirts available in Arkansas from the total number of t-shirts available in both states, we get 94 - 47 = 47 t-shirts left over. So, the amount of money earned per t-shirt would be $87 / 47 = $1.80.
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold in each market is given as follows:  In Arkansas, 242 t-shirts were sold, and in Texas, 115 t-shirts were sold. So, the difference between the number of t-shirts sold in Arkansas and Texas is:  Arkansas - Texas = 242 - 115 = 127 t-shirts. Therefore, there are 127 more t-shirts sold in Arkansas than in Texas.
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold in each store is 98. Since there are 163 stores in Arkansas and Texas combined, the total number of t-shirts sold in both states together is 163 x 98 = 15,744 t-shirts. Now, let's calculate how much money each store owner made if they sold 89 t-shirts each. If each t-shirt costs $9.80, then the total revenue from selling t-shirts in each store is 89 x $9.80 = $861.20 per store. Therefore, the total amount of money made by all the store owners in Arkansas and Texas combined is 15,744 x $861.20 = $13,376,880.
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold in each store is 78 per day. There are 30 stores in Arkansas and Texas combined. Therefore, the total number of t-shirts sold in both states together is 30 x 78 = 2340 t-shirts per day. Now, let's calculate how much money each store makes if they sell 186 t-shirts per day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of t-shirts sold (2340) by the number of stores (30). So, each store sells an average of 2340 / 30 = 78 t-shirts per day. If each t-shirt costs $7.80, then the total revenue generated by all 30 stores per day is 78 x $7.80 = $569.60 per day.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $62 and each jeans costs $99. If Arkansas sells 183 T-shirts and Texas sells 31 jeans, then the total revenue generated from these sales will be: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt + Number of Jeans x Cost per Jeans Total Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99 Total Revenue = $11,573 So, Arkansas made $11,573 in revenue from selling T-shirts and Texas made $3,049 in revenue from selling jeans.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $67 and that of each jeans is $165. If there are 74 T-shirts and 156 jeans, then the total cost of all the clothes will be: Total Cost = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt + Number of Jeans x Cost per Jeans Total Cost = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 Total Cost = $49,820 + $25,300 Total Cost = $75,120 So, the total amount of money spent on buying these clothes is $75,120.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $19 and each pair of jeans costs $34. If Arkansas and Texas produce 157 T-shirts and 19 jeans respectively, then the total cost of producing these items for both states together would be:  Cost of T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt = 157 x $19 = $2863 Cost of Jeans = Number of Jeans x Cost per Jeans = 19 x $34 = $656 Total Cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of Jeans = $2863 + $656 = $3519 So, the total cost of producing these items for both states together is $3519.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $86 and each jeans costs $232. So, in total, Arkansas makes $254 per T-shirt and Texas makes $432 per jeans. Now, let's calculate the percentage difference between the two states.  Percentage Difference = ($432 - $254) / $254 x 100% = 74.9%
Response:  The total number of T-shirts in stock is 51. Each T-shirt costs $20. If Arkansas and Texas each buy 8 T-shirts, then how much money will be made?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of T-shirts sold = Total number of T-shirts x Number of customers who bought T-shirts  In this case, the number of T-shirts sold is:  Number of T-shirts sold = 51 x (8/2) = 40 T-shirts  So, if Arkansas and Texas each buy 8 T-shirts, then 40 T-shirts will be sold in total, resulting in $800 in revenue ($40 x $20 per T-shirt).
Response:  Raju has 201 t-shirts and he sells each one for $27. If he sold 14 t-shirts, then he earned $368 ($27 x 14). So, Raju earned $368 from selling 14 t-shirts.
"Response:  Arkansas and Texas are two states in the United States with different economies. Arkansas has an economy that is primarily based on agriculture, while Texas has an economy that is more diversified across various industries such as technology, energy, and healthcare. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the prices of T-shirts in both states without considering their respective economic conditions. However, we can make an educated guess based on some assumptions.
Assuming that the cost of production for each T-shirt is similar in both states (which may or may not be true), if the price of a T-shirt in Arkansas is $10, then the price of a T-shirt in Texas would likely be higher due to the state's larger population and economy. For example, let's assume that the price of a T-shirt in Texas is 20% higher than in Arkansas, which means that the price of a T-shirt in Texas would be around $12 (10 x 1.2). So, if you buy 60 T-shirts from Texas, you would pay approximately $720 ($12 x 60)."
Response:  Arkansas and Texas are two states in the United States. The total population of these two states is approximately 215 million people (Arkansas - 3 million, Texas - 29 million). Now, let's assume that each person in these states buys an average of 215 t-shirts per year (based on the global average consumption of clothing). This means that the total number of t-shirts sold in Arkansas and Texas combined would be around 43 billion t-shirts per year (215 x 215 million = 43750 billion). Now, if we calculate the revenue generated from selling these t-shirts at $21.5 per shirt, the total revenue would be around $897.5 billion per year ($21.5 x 43750 billion = $89750 billion). So, the answer to the question is $897.5 billion.
Response:  Raju buys 5 T-shirts and each costs $10. He also buys 215 shorts and each costs $21.50. In total, he spends $10 x 5 = $50 on T-shirts and $215 x 64 = $13,760 on shorts. So, Raju spends a total of $50 + $13,760 = $14,810.
Response:  Raju has 76 dollars and each T-shirt costs $204. So, he can buy 3 T-shirts with his money. Now, let's calculate how many Jerseys he can buy with the remaining amount. There are 158 T-shirts in total, and each Jersey costs $204. Therefore, Raju can buy 76/2 = 38 Jerseys with the remaining amount of money.
Response:  Raju has $210 and wants to buy T-shirts for himself and his friends. He can buy 17 T-shirts with that amount. If he buys one T-shirt per friend, then he will have enough money to buy 23 T-shirts. So, the total number of T-shirts Raju can buy is 17 + 23 = 40.
Response:  Raju has 115 dollars and he wants to buy t-shirts and jeans for himself and his friends. He has budgeted $115 for this purpose.  There are 78 jeans available at $25 each, so the total cost of jeans is: 78 x $25 = $1900.  Now, there are 113 t-shirts available at $11 each, so the total cost of t-shirts is: 113 x $11 = $1243.  Therefore, the total cost of both jeans and t-shirts comes out to be $1900 + $1243 = $3143.
Response:  We have 5 tables of 10 chairs each, so in total we have 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. Now, let's assume that each table has 4 people sitting around it, which means there are 4 x 50 = 200 people attending the party. Therefore, the answer is 200.
Response:  There are 12 tables in total, and each table can seat 4 people. So, the number of people who can sit at all the tables together is: 12 x 4 = 48 people.
Response:  We know that there are 3 tables of 3 cups each, so total number of cups is 3 x 3 = 9 cups. Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 cups are there in total. To do this, we will divide the total number of cups by 3, which gives us 9 / 3 = 3 sets of 3 cups. Therefore, there are 3 sets of 3 cups in total.
Response:  We have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs. So, in total, we have 11 x 13 = 143 chairs.
Response:  We have 10 tables with 6 chairs each, so in total we have 60 chairs. Now, if 11 people are sitting and there are only 48 chairs available, then some people will not be able to sit. So, the number of people who cannot sit is 48 - 48 = 0. Therefore, no one cannot sit.
Response:  We have 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, in total, we have 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Now, out of these 168 chairs, 6 are extra chairs. Therefore, the number of extra chairs is 6.
Response:  There are 14 people in the party and each table can seat 3 people. So, we need to find out how many tables are required for 14 people.  We have 4 tables in total, so we can divide 14 by 4 to get the number of tables needed.  Therefore, there will be 3.5 tables (or 3 tables and 75% of one table) needed for 14 people.
Response:  We have to find out how many tables are required for 14 people in each table. Since there are 9 tables available, we need to divide 14 by 9 to get the number of people that can sit at each table. So, the answer is: Number of people who can sit at each table = 14 / 9 = 1.57 people per table.
Response:  Louis Vuitton sold $460 worth of luggage to each of the 5 customers. So, in total, Louis Vuitton made $2300 from these 5 customers (5 x $460 = $2300).
Response:  Louis has $1216 and he wants to divide it equally among 16 people. So, each person will get $\$76$. Now, if Kapani gives $\$16$ more to each of these 16 people, then how much money will each person receive in total? Therefore, the answer is $\$93$.
Response:  Louis has $216 and he spends $702 on something. So, his remaining amount is $702 - $216 = $486. Now, if he gives $486 to Capone, then Capone gets $486 x 21% = $99.82. Therefore, Capone receives $99.82.
Response:  If Jairus has invested $223 in 223 hangers and each hanger costs $1 dollar, then he has invested a total of $223. Now, if he sells each hanger for $1357, he will make a profit of $1134 ($1357 - $223) per hanger. So, if he sells all 223 hangers, he will make a total profit of $260,890 ($1134 x 223).
Response:  Louis Vuitton sells one handbag for $1091 and it takes 28 days to make one bag. So if they produce 939 bags in a day, their daily revenue from handbags would be: $1091 x 939 = $102,679. Now, let's calculate how much profit they make per day: Profit = Revenue - Cost of production (in dollars) = Daily revenue x Profit margin (%) = $102,679 x 50% = $51,340. Therefore, Louis Vuitton makes approximately $51,340 in profits every day.
Response:  Louis has $233 and he spends $403 on hangouts with his friends. If he had spent $49 more, then he would have spent a total of $542. So, if he had earned $169 less than what he spent, then he must have earned $433.
Response:  Louis has $1359 and he wants to give $368 to his friend. So, he will have $991 left after giving money to his friend. Now, if he gives $388 to his friend, then he will have $603 left ( $991 - $388 = $603). Therefore, the amount of money that Louis can give to his friend is $603.
Response:  Louis Vuitton handbags are sold at $1181 each. If there are 216 handbags in total, then the revenue from selling those handbags is: Revenue = Number of handbags x Price per handbag = 216 x $1181 = $250,376 So, the amount of money that Kapiya has made from selling Louis Vuitton handbags is: Profit = Total revenue - Cost = $250,376 -? (Cost of producing/buying the handbags)
Response: 19 apples cost $13.30. So, if we sell each apple for $0.70, how many apples can we sell to make $13.30? Solution: To find out how many apples we can sell to make $13.30, we need to divide the amount of money we want to make ($13.30) by the price of one apple ($0.70). Therefore, we can sell 19 x 0.70 = 13 apples to make $13.30.
Response:  Louis has $20 and he spends $178 on something. Now, he has $156 left. So, he spent $\$178 - \$20 = \$158$.
Response:  We have to find out how many holes can be made in a pot of diameter 10 inches and height 8 inches if we start from the top and make holes of size 1 inch each. To do this, we need to calculate the area of the circle that represents the top part of the pot. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius of the top part of the pot is half of its diameter, or 5 inches. So, the area of the top part of the pot is: Area = π(5)^2 = 25π square inches Now, we want to know how many holes can fit inside this area. To do this, we divide the area of the top part of the pot by the area of one hole. If we assume that each hole has an area of 1 inch x 1 inch = 1 square inch, then: Number of holes = Area of top part of pot / Area of one hole = 25π square inches / 1 square inch = 25π holes Now, since we want to make holes of size 1 inch each, we round up the number of holes to the nearest whole number. There are 360 degrees in a full circle, so we can also express the number of holes as 25π x 360 = 900 holes. Therefore, there can be approximately 900 holes made in a pot of diameter 10 inches and height 8 inches if we start from the top and make holes of size 1 inch each.
Response:  We have to find out how much water can fit in Ron's container if he wants to fill it up to 14 feet high and there are only 8 feet of clearance above the top of the container.  To do this, we need to divide the height of the container (14 feet) by the clearance above the top of the container (8 feet). This gives us a ratio of 14/8 = 1.75. So, for every 1.75 feet of height in the container, there is 1 foot of clearance above the top of the container. Now, let's calculate how many inches of water can fit in the container based on its height and width. The width of the container is given as 3 feet, so the volume of water that can fit in the container is equal to the product of its length, width, and depth (or height). Therefore, the volume of water that can fit in the container is 3 x 3 x 1.75 = 21.75 cubic feet. Finally, since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the volume of water from cubic feet to inches by dividing it by 12. Therefore, the total volume of water that can fit in the container is 21.75 x 12 = 260.75 inches.
Response:  We have to find out how much water can fit in Ron's pond if it is 11 feet wide and has a depth of 6 feet. To do this, we need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is: Volume = Length x Width x Height For our problem, the length (L) is equal to 11 feet, the width (W) is also equal to 11 feet, and the height (H) is equal to 6 feet. So, using the formula above, we get: Volume = 11 x 11 x 6 = 731 cubic feet Now, we are asked how many gallons of water can fit in Ron's pond. One gallon is equal to 0.0625 cubic feet, so we can convert the volume of water from cubic feet to gallons as follows: Number of gallons = Volume in cubic feet / 0.0625 = 731 / 0.0625 = approximately 11,480 gallons Therefore, according to the calculation, approximately 11,480 gallons of water can fit in Ron's pond if it is 11 feet wide and has a depth of 6 feet.
Response:  We know that Vishranti has 15 feet in height and Ronpeksha is 4 feet tall. So, if we want to find out how many times Vishranti is taller than Ronpeksha, we can divide their heights:  Height of Vishranti = 15 feet Height of Ronpeksha = 4 feet Now, let's divide them: 15 feet / 4 feet = 3.75 times Taller than Ronpeksha By this calculation, Vishranti is 3.75 times taller than Ronpeksha.
Response:  The height of Ron is given as 9 feet and that of Pooh as 5 feet. So, the difference in their heights is 4 feet (9 - 5 = 4). Now, we need to find out how many times this difference can be accommodated in the height of Piglet. Since Piglet's height is 16 inches, we can divide the difference between Ron and Pooh by 16 to get the number of times it can fit. Therefore, the number of times the difference in height between Ron and Pooh can fit in Piglet's height is: 4 feet / 16 inches = 0.25 or 1/4. So, Piglet's height is approximately equal to 1/4 of the difference in height between Ron and Pooh.
Response:  We have to find out how many feet Ron is tall and then compare it with Din's height. According to the question, Ron is 15 feet tall and Din is 6 feet short of Ron. So, if we subtract 6 from 15, we get 9 feet. Therefore, Ron is 9 feet taller than Din.
Response:  We have 34 books in total and we want to know how many of them are present in each shelf. Since there are two shelves, let's assume that each shelf has an equal number of books. Therefore, the number of books in each shelf is 17 (34 / 2). So, one shelf has 17 books and the other shelf has 17 books as well.
Response:  We have 42 books in total and each book has 2 shelves. So, we have 84 shelves in total (42 x 2 = 84). Now, let's calculate how many shelves are empty. If there are 42 books on each shelf, then there will be 42 - 16 = 26 empty shelves (since some books may be on both sides of a shelf). Therefore, out of 84 shelves, 26 are empty (84 - 26 = 58 non-empty shelves).
Response:  Brainard has written 23 books and each book is available for 27 weeks. So, in total, he has made his books available for 641 weeks (23 x 27). However, as per the question, only 80 months are available after which the books will be out of stock. Therefore, the number of books that Brainard has left to sell is: 641 - 80 = 561 books.
Response:  Brainard has written 9 books and each book takes him approximately 10 months to write. So, in total, he spends 9 x 10 = 90 months writing books. Now, there are 46 months in a year, so Brainard writes books for (90 - 46) = 44 months of the year.
"Response:  Brainard has written 29 books and each book contains an average of 30 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages written by Brainard is:

29 x 30 = 870 pages
Now, let's calculate how many months it would take to write 870 pages at a rate of 61 pages per month:

870 pages / 61 pages per month = 14 months
Therefore, Brainard wrote 14 months worth of pages (870 pages) in the time period given in the question (29 years)."
Response:  Brain has 7 books. Each book contains 28 pages. So, total number of pages in all 7 books is: 7 x 28 = 196 pages. Now, each shelf has equal number of books. If there are 28 books on each shelf, then total number of shelves required to accommodate all 196 pages is: 196 / 28 = 7 shelves. Therefore, there are 7 shelves in total.
Response:  We have 38 books in total and each book has two shelves. So, we have 76 shelves (38 x 2 = 76). Now, let's count how many shelves are empty. In one of the shelves, there is only one book left. So, out of 76 shelves, 75 shelves are empty (76 - 1 = 75). Therefore, there are 75 empty shelves.
Response:  Carol has 10 friends and each friend gives her 2 pieces of advice per package. So, in total, Carol receives 20 pieces of advice from all her friends (10 friends x 2 pieces of advice/friend). However, if some of Carol's friends give more than one piece of advice per package, then the total number of pieces of advice she receives will be greater than 20. For example, if 3 of Carol's friends give 3 pieces of advice per package, then she will receive a total of 60 pieces of advice (3 friends x 3 pieces of advice/friend = 9 pieces of advice). Therefore, the correct answer is 60.
Response:  We have 12 friends and we want to distribute 3 packs of chocolates among them equally. So, each friend will get 1/4th of a pack (or 3/12) of chocolates. Therefore, each friend will receive 3/12 = 0.25 packs of chocolates.
Response:  Carol has 10 friends and each friend gets 7 chocolates in total. So, the number of chocolates that Carol distributes among her 2 friends is: 10 x 7 = 70 chocolates. Therefore, out of 70 chocolates, Carol distributes 20 chocolates to each of her 2 friends.
Response:  We have to find out how many friends Carol can invite for each of her 14 parties and then calculate the total number of friends she can invite in all.  If each party has 14 guests, then Carol can invite 14 x 6 = 84 friends in total. So, Carol can invite 84 friends in all.
Response:  Carol has 9 friends and each friend gives her 3 advices. So, in total, Carol receives 9 x 3 = 27 advices from her friends. However, she already knows 2 of those advices, so the number of new advices she receives is 27 - 2 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 new advices that Carol does not know yet.
Response:  Melisa has 12 qualities and can make 36 different games with those qualities. So, there are 36 possible games that Melisa can play.
Response:  We have three balls of different colors - red, blue and green. Each ball has 81 facets or sides. Now, we want to know how many times each color appears in all possible combinations of 3 balls. To do this, we need to count the number of ways each color can appear in each combination. For example, if there are 3 red balls, then there are 3! = 6 ways for the red balls to be arranged (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA). Similarly, there are 3! = 6 ways for the blue balls to be arranged (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA), and 3! = 6 ways for the green balls to be arranged (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA). So, the total number of ways to arrange the 3 balls is 6 x 6 x 6 = 216. Therefore, the probability that any particular combination of 3 balls will have the same color on all 3 balls is 1/216.
Response:  Melissa has 109 qualities and each game has 82 points. To find out how many qualities Melissa has in total, we need to multiply the number of qualities she has with the number of points in each game. So, 109 x 82 = 8640. Therefore, Melissa has 8640 qualities.
Response:  Melissa has 21 candies and each candy contains 7 different flavors. To find out how many unique flavors there are in total, we need to multiply the number of candies by the number of flavors per candy. So, the total number of unique flavors is: 21 x 7 = 147 unique flavors.
Response:  Melissa has 13 cards with different numbers of dots on them. Each card has one or more dots. So, there are 91 possible combinations. Therefore, in each game, Melissa can have up to 91 different sets of dots.
Response:  We have to find out how many people can sit in each row of seats and then calculate the total number of people who can fit in the park.  So, let's assume that there are 4 rows of seats in the park.  Each row has 5 seats, so we can seat 20 people in total (5 x 4 = 20).
Response:  We have to find out how many seats are available in each row of the park and then calculate the total number of seats available.  Each row has 9 seats, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 seats in a row. Since there are 18 rows in the park, the total number of seats in the park is 27 x 18 = 466 seats. Therefore, there are 466 seats available in the park.
Response:  We know that there are 19 parking spaces in each floor of the multi-level car park. Since each floor has 15 parking slots, we can calculate the total number of parking slots as follows: Total Number of Parking Slots = Number of Floors x Number of Parking Spaces per Floor Total Number of Parking Slots = 3 x 19 = 57 So, 57 cars can fit in each level of the multi-level car park. Now, let's assume that each level is fully utilized with cars, which means all 57 parking slots are occupied. If so, then the total number of cars that can be accommodated in the entire multi-level car park would be: Total Number of Cars Accommodated = Total Number of Parking Slots x Capacity of Each Parking Space Total Number of Cars Accommodated = 57 x 15 = 855 cars. Therefore, 855 cars can fit in the entire multi-level car park.
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in each coach and each seat can accommodate 3 passengers. So, total number of passengers who can travel in one coach is 18 x 3 = 54 passengers. Now, we have to find out how many coaches are required to carry 1000 passengers. To do this, we divide the total number of passengers (1000) by the number of passengers that can accommodate in one coach (54). Therefore, the number of coaches required to carry 1000 passengers is 1000 / 54 = 19 coaches.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 parking spaces in each row and there are 16 rows of parking spaces in total. So, the number of parking spaces in one side of the park is:

6 x 16 = 96

Now, we need to find out how many parking spaces are available for each car. Since each row has 14 parking spaces, the number of parking spaces available for each car is:

14 / 2 (as there are two cars per space) = 7

So, there are 7 parking spaces available for each car in the entire park."
"Response:  We have to find out how many people can sit in each row and how many rows are there in total. Then we will know how many seats are available for all the people.  From the given information, we know that there are 23 rows of seats in the auditorium and each row has 14 seats. So, the total number of seats in the auditorium is:

Number of rows = 23
Seats per row = 14
Total number of seats = Number of rows x Seats per row = 23 x 14 = 306 seats
Now, we need to find out how many people can fit in each seat. Since each seat can accommodate 5 people, we can calculate the total number of people who can attend the event as follows:

Total number of people = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat = 306 seats / 5 people per seat = 61.2 people (approximately)
So, approximately 61.2 people can fit in each row of seats in the auditorium, and since there are 23 rows in total, the maximum capacity of the auditorium is approximately 1378 people (61.2 people per row x 23 rows)."
Response:  We have to find out how many people can sit in each row and then multiply it with the total number of rows to get the total capacity of the park.  Each row has space for 16 people, so we need to divide the total number of seats by 16 to find out how many rows there are.  There are 7 rows in total, as mentioned in the question. Therefore, the total capacity of the park is: Total Capacity = Number of Rows x Seats per Row = 7 x 16 = 112 seats.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra and each seat can accommodate 4 voters per booth. So, the total number of voters who can cast their votes in one round is:

Total number of voters = Number of Lok Sabha seats x Total number of voters per booth
= 16 x 4
= 64

Therefore, the maximum number of voters who can cast their votes in one round is 64."
Response:  We have 4 people and 3 seats available in the car. So, each person will have to share a seat with another person. Therefore, there are 3 possible combinations of sharing one seat between 4 people: (1,2), (1,3), or (2,3). Since we cannot have more than 3 people sitting in the same seat, we can eliminate the combination (1,2) as it would result in 4 people occupying only 3 seats. Hence, there is only one possible combination left, which is (1,3). So, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have 7 piles of rice. Each pile has an equal number of grains. If there are 14 grains in each pile, then the total number of grains in all 7 piles is: 7 x 14 = 98 grains. So, there are 98 grains in each pile.
Response:  Since there are 28 slips in total and you have already taken 10, then there are 18 remaining slips left. So, out of these 18 slips, if you take 9 more, then you will have taken 19 slips in total. Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  We have 25 people and each person has 4 tukde (pieces) of rice. So, total number of pieces of rice = 25 x 4 = 100 pieces.
Response:  We have to find out how many pizzas each person can eat in one sitting based on their weight and height.  For example, if someone weighs 60 kg and is 170 cm tall, they can eat 10 slices of pizza at once. So, if there are 9 people in total, then the number of slices each person can eat = Total number of slices / Number of people. Therefore, the total number of slices that all 9 people together can eat = 10 x 9 = 90 slices.
Response:  We have 45 fruits and each fruit bag contains 10 bags. So, in total we have 45 x 10 = 450 bags of fruits. Now, if there are 45 fruits in one bag, then there will be 45 / 10 = 4.5 bags of fruits in one fruit bag. Therefore, to find out how many bags of fruits there are, we can multiply the number of fruits per bag with the total number of bags: 450 bags of fruits × 4.5 bags/fruit = 2,175 bags of fruits.
Response:  We have 9 full bags of rice and we want to distribute them equally among 45 people. So, each person will get 1/9 x 45 = 5 bags of rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many full circles can be formed with 36 flowers and 58 flowers respectively.  For 36 flowers, we can form 12 full circles (since each flower makes one-third of a circle). So, there are 12 full circles possible with 36 flowers.  Similarly, for 58 flowers, we can form 58/4 = 14 full circles (since each flower makes one-fourth of a circle). Therefore, there are 14 full circles possible with 58 flowers.
Response:  We have to find out how many full baskets are there in total and then calculate the number of full baskets that can be made from each basket.  Total number of full baskets = Number of baskets x Capacity of one basket / Size of one basket = 55 baskets x 15/60 = 37.5 full baskets. So, there will be approximately 37.5 full baskets.
Response:  We have 60 bags of rice and each bag contains 10 kg of rice. So, in total we have 60 x 10 = 600 kg of rice. Now, if we want to distribute it equally among 7 people, we will divide 600 kg by 7, which gives us 85.71 kg per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 85.71 kg of rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 32 full jute bags.  Each jute bag contains 50 kg of rice, so we need to divide 32 by 50 to get the number of bags that can be filled.  Therefore, there are 64 bags of rice (32 / 50 = 64).
Response:  We have 11 friends and each of them can eat 2 crepes at a time. So, in total, we need to make 2 x 11 = 22 crepes.
Response:  If there are 5 friends and each friend has to give 2 biscuits to each of their other 4 friends, then the total number of biscuits given will be:  Number of friends = 5 Friends giving biscuits to each other = 4 friends x 2 biscuits per friend = 8 biscuits Total number of biscuits given = 8 biscuits So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 15 biscuits and we want to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 3 biscuits (15/5 = 3). Now, let's assume that each friend has already eaten 2 crackers (10/5 = 2) before they received the biscuits from us. Therefore, each friend now has a total of 5 crackers (3 + 2 = 5).
Response:  We have to find out how many friends Mathyoo has and then calculate how many crackers each friend will get.  So, let's assume that Mathyoo has x number of friends. Since there are 24 biscuits in total, and each friend gets 3 biscuits, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of biscuits = Total number of friends x Number of biscuits per friend  In this case, the number of biscuits is equal to 24, so we can set up the equation as follows: 24 = x x 3  Now, we need to solve for the value of x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: 8 = x  Therefore, Mathyoo has 8 friends. Now, since each friend gets 3 crackers, we know that Mathyoo has given away a total of 8 x 3 = 24 crackers.
"Response:  We have 22 math books and 34 keys. If we distribute them equally among 11 friends, then each friend will get:

Response:  We have 6 friends and we want to distribute 36 crackers among them equally. So, each friend will get 36/6 = 6 crackers.
Response:  There are 23 friends in total and they have to share 11 crackers equally among themselves. So, each friend will get 2/3 of an cracker (since there are 23 friends). Now, let's calculate how many crackers each friend will get:  Number of crackers per friend = Total number of crackers / Number of friends = 11 / 23 = 0.5 or half a cracker. Therefore, each friend will get half a cracker.
Response:  We have 31 friends and we want to divide them equally among 5 cricket teams of 6 players each. So, we will need 5 x 31 = 155 players for all the teams. Now, let's assume that there are 23 players in each team. Therefore, the number of teams is: Number of teams = Total number of players / Number of players per team = 155 / 23 = 6.7 teams. Since you cannot have a fraction of a team, we can round up to 7 teams.
Response:  We have to find out how many crackers are required for each of the four friends and then add them up.  For A1, he needs 32 crackers, so he requires 32/4 = 8 crackers. Similarly, B1 needs 98 crackers, so he requires 98/4 = 24 crackers. C1 needs 76 crackers, so he requires 76/4 = 19 crackers. D1 needs 50 crackers, so he requires 50/4 = 12 crackers. Therefore, there are 8 + 24 + 19 + 12 = 73 crackers in total.
Response:  We have 10 biscuits and 8 keys. Each key can open one lock. So, we need to divide the number of locks among the friends as follows: Friend 1 needs 2 locks (since he has 2 keys), friend 2 needs 3 locks (since she has 3 keys), and so on until all the locks are distributed equally among the 4 friends. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of locks each friend gets = Total number of locks / Number of friends = 10/4 = 2.5 locks per friend.
Response:  We have 28 friends and we want to divide them equally among 13 pots and 15 cups.  To do this, we need to find out how many friends can be accommodated in each pot and cup.  If there are 28 friends, then each pot can hold 28/13 = 2 friends, and each cup can hold 28/15 = 1 friend. Therefore, 13 pots can accommodate 2 x 2 = 4 friends, and 15 cups can accommodate 1 x 1 = 1 friend. So, there will be 4 friends in 13 pots and 1 friend in 15 cups.
Response:  We know that Debbie has 109 batteries and she uses them for 74 days. So, we need to calculate how many batteries she used per day. To do this, we divide the total number of batteries (109) by the number of days she used them (74): 109 / 74 = 1.46 batteries per day. Therefore, Debbie used approximately 1.46 batteries per day.
Response:  We know that Debbie has 153 pencils and she uses one every day. So, in 17 days, she will use all the pencils. Now, let's calculate how many pencils she will have left after 17 days. If she uses one pencil per day, then she will have used 17 x 1 = 17 pencils in total. Since she had 153 pencils initially, she will have 153 - 17 = 136 pencils left after 17 days. Therefore, the answer is 136.
Response:  Debbie has 264 balls and she wants to distribute them equally among 11 days. So, she will have to give 23 balls per day (264/11 = 23). Now, let's see how many balls each day will get. Day 1 will get 15 balls (11 x 23 = 23), Day 2 will get 8 balls (15 - 7 = 8), Day 3 will get 5 balls (8 - 3 = 5), and so on... Therefore, there are 23 balls for Day 1, 8 balls for Day 2, 5 balls for Day 3, and so on...
"Response:  We know that Debbie has 301 pencils and she uses 144 of them every day. So, we can calculate how many days it will take for her to finish all the pencils as follows:

Number of days = Number of pencils / Number used per day
= 301 / 144
= 2.09 years
Therefore, Debbie will finish all the pencils in approximately 2 years and 3 months."
Response:  We have 88 pans and 13 sodas. If we divide the pans equally among the days of the week (7 days), then each pan will be used for how many days?  Yes, that's right! Each pan will be used for 12 days (88 / 7 = 12). Now, let's calculate how many sodas are left after 12 days. There are 87 sodas remaining (13 - 12 = 1). So, in total, there are 109 items (88 pans + 13 sodas) left after 12 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for 312 pots of water and 480 pots of water to be emptied respectively.  So, we need to divide the number of pots by the number of days taken to empty each pot.  For 312 pots of water, it takes 7 days (312 / 45 = 7).  And for 480 pots of water, it takes 6 days (480 / 80 = 6). Therefore, if there are 312 pots of water and 480 pots of water, they will be emptied in 7 + 6 = 13 days.
Response:  We know that Debi has 6 bats and she wants to give one to each of her friends. So, total number of bats = 6. Now, we are asked how many days it will take for Debi to distribute all these bats among her 12 friends. To find out, let's assume that Debi gives 1 bat per day to each friend. Therefore, total number of days required to distribute all bats = Number of bats / Number of friends = 6 / 12 = 5 days. So, Debi will need 5 days to distribute all 6 bats among her 12 friends.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it will take for Debbie to complete 95 batteries and 180 plates.  Since Debbie can make 15 batteries and 54 plates in one day, we need to divide the total number of batteries and plates by the number of days she works per day.  So, it will take Debbie 95/15 = 6.33 days to complete all 95 batteries, and 180/54 = 3.33 days to complete all 180 plates. Therefore, Debbie will work for a total of 6 + 3 = 9 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for 360 batteries and 162 batteries to be used up respectively.  So, we need to divide the number of batteries by the number of days in a year (365 days).  For 360 batteries, it will take approximately 1 day to use up all the batteries, as there are only 360 batteries.  On the other hand, for 162 batteries, it will take approximately 2 years to use up all the batteries, as there are 365 days in a year. Therefore, the answer is 1 day for 360 batteries and 2 years for 162 batteries.

Pens: 31 x 0.5 = 15.5 points
Pencils: 27 x 0.3 = 8.1 points
Therefore, there are 15.5 + 8.1 = 23.6 points in total."
Response:  We have to find out how many pencils can fit in each box and then multiply it with the number of boxes available. So, let's calculate the capacity of each box first. According to the question, each box can hold 30 pens. Now, we know that each pen takes up 5 units of space, so we can calculate the total space required for one box as follows: Space required per box = Number of pens x Space required per pen = 30 x 5 = 150 units. Therefore, there are 150 units of space available in each box. Now, let's calculate the number of pencils that can fit in one box: Pencils per box = Available space in box / Size of a pencil = 150 / Size of a pencil (which is not given) =? Since we don't know the size of a pencil, we cannot determine the exact number of pencils that can fit in one box. However, based on our calculation, we can say that at least some pencils will fit in each box.
Response:  We have two pens and six pencils. If each pen can hold one pencil, then how many pencils can be held in total? Therefore, the answer is 6 pencils.
Response:  We have 35 pens and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 8 pens (35/4 = 8). Now, let's say that each pen can hold 2 pencils. So, if one person gets 8 pens, they will be able to store 16 pencils (8 x 2 = 16). Therefore, there will be 160 pencils in total (35 x 4 = 160).
"Response:  We know that there are 31 pens in total and each pack contains 6 pens. So, the number of packs required to fill 19 pens is:

Number of packs = Number of pens / Number of pens per pack
= 19 / 6
= 3

Therefore, there are 3 packs required to fill 19 pens."
Response:  We know that there are 30 pens in total and each pen has 71% fill. So, we can calculate the number of pens with full filling as follows: Number of pens with full filling = Total number of pens x Percentage of full filling = 30 x 0.71 = 21.3 pens Now, let's check if any pen is fully filled. If all the pens have at least 24 pens (which is the percentage of full filling), then yes, one pen is fully filled. But since not all pens have at least 24 pens, none of them are fully filled. Therefore, the answer is zero.
Response:  We have 16 pens and 4 pencils. Each pen has 6 colors, so there are 16 x 6 = 96 colors in total. Similarly, each pencil has 21 colors, so there are 4 x 21 = 84 colors in total. Therefore, there are 96 + 84 = 180 different colors in total.
Response:  We have 21 fields and 98 students. Each field has 7 basements. So, in total, we have 21 x 7 = 147 basements. Now, each student will occupy one basement, so there are 98 students x 1 basement per student = 98 basements available for occupation. Therefore, the number of basements that will be occupied is 147 - 98 = 50 basements.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 fields in total and each field has an area of 118 square feet. So, the total area of all the fields is:

84 x 118 = 96072 square feet
Now, we need to find out how many students can fit in this area. Since each bus can accommodate 50 students, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:

Number of buses = Total area / Area per bus
= 96072 sq ft / 50 sq ft/bus
= 1921.44 buses
So, approximately 1921 buses can fit in the area of all the fields."
Response:  We have 67 students in each batch and 6 students per bench. So, total number of benches = 67 / 6 = 11. Now, we need to find out how many students can sit in one bench. Since there are 6 students per bench, so total capacity of one bench = 6. Therefore, total number of students that can sit in all the benches = Total number of benches x Capacity of one bench = 11 x 6 = 66.
Response:  We have 87 students in total and each class has 16 students. So, there are 5 classes in total. Now, we need to find out how many schools will be required to accommodate all these students. To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each class. In this case, we get: Number of schools = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 87 / 16 = 5.33 schools Therefore, approximately 5.33 schools will be required to accommodate all 87 students.
"Response:  We have:
Number of fields = 24
Number of students in each field = 120
Total number of students = Number of fields x Number of students in each field
= 24 x 120
= 2880
So, there are 2880 students in total."
Response:  We have to find out how many students can be accommodated in each bus and then calculate the total number of buses required based on that.  From the given information, we know that there are 66 fields and 102 students. Each field has 8 students, so the total number of students who need transportation is 8 x 66 = 504. Now, since there are only 22 buses available, we need to divide the total number of students who need transportation by the number of buses available to get an idea of how many students each bus can accommodate. Therefore, the number of students each bus can accommodate is 504 / 22 = 23.
Response:  We have 102 students in total and each student has to go for an excursion. So, the number of students who will go for the excursion is 102. Now, we know that 11 students are from the science stream and each student from this stream has to pay Rs.99 as the trip fee. Therefore, the total amount of money that these 11 students will pay towards the trip fee is 11 x 99 = Rs.1089. Hence, the remaining 91 students (who are not from the science stream) will have to pay Rs.99 - Rs.1089 = Rs.901 towards the trip fee.
Response:  We have to find out how many students can be accommodated in each hostel and then calculate the total number of students who can be accommodated in all the hostels.  From the question, we know that there are 72 hostels and each hostel has space for 3 students per room. So, the total number of students who can be accommodated in each hostel is 3 x 72 = 216 students. Now, let's calculate the total number of students who can be accommodated in all the hostels together. Since there are 111 students in total, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of hostels to get the average number of students each hostel can accommodate. Therefore, the average number of students each hostel can accommodate is 111 / 72 = 1.54 students per hostel.
Response:  We have 17 groups of students and each group has 46 students. So, in total, we have 17 x 46 = 782 students. Now, let's calculate how many students will attend each bus. Since there are 92 students who will not be attending any bus, so the number of students attending each bus is 782 - 92 = 690. Therefore, approximately 690 students will attend each bus.
Response:  If Helena has 11 bullets in her gun and she fires one bullet at each of the 9 mules, then how many bullets will be left with her after firing all the 9 mules? So, there will be 11 - 9 = 2 bullets left with Helena.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 bullets in total and each bullet has 5 bullets inside it. So, the number of bullets inside all the 10 boxes is:

10 x 5 = 50 bullets

So, there are 50 bullets inside all the 10 boxes."
Response:  We have to find out how many gulps of water each person can drink in one minute.  So, we need to divide the total number of gulps (23) by the number of people (4).  Therefore, each person can drink approximately 5.75 gulps of water per minute (23/4 = 5.75).
Response:  We have to find out how many bullets are required for each group of 13 people and then multiply it with the total number of groups (50). So, we need to divide 26 by 13 and then multiply the result by 50. Therefore, the answer is: 26 / 13 x 50 = 490 bullets.
Response:  We have to find out how many gulps of water Helly can take in one minute.  Since she is drinking from a glass with a capacity of 20 ml, we need to divide the total amount of water (in ml) by the capacity of her glass. So, if Helly takes 20 gulps per minute, then each gulp contains 20/6 = 3.33 ml of water. Now, let's calculate how much water Mulla can hold in his mouth at once. As he has a wide mouth, he can hold more than others. Let's assume that he can hold 5 times as much water as Helly can hold in one gulp. Therefore, Mulla can hold 5 x 3.33 = 16.65 ml of water in his mouth at once.
Response:  If each mule can carry two bags of wheat, and there are 28 bags of wheat in total, then how many bags of wheat will each mule be able to carry?  We need to divide the total number of bags of wheat by the number of mules available. In this case, we have 28 bags of wheat and 4 mules (as mentioned in the question), so we can calculate as follows: Number of bags of wheat that each mule can carry = Total number of bags of wheat / Number of mules Available for carrying bags of wheat = 28 / 4 = 7 bags of wheat per mule Therefore, each mule can carry 7 bags of wheat.
Response:  We know that there are 392 pages in the book and it takes 14 days to read them completely. So, we can calculate the number of pages read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to read them = 392 / 14 = 27 pages per day. Therefore, if you read the entire book in one sitting, you would take approximately 27 days to finish reading it.
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and we have to read 22 books in a year. So, each book has to be read approximately every 569 days (365 / 22 = 569).
"Response:  The book has 612 pages and contains 24 chapters. To complete reading the book in 6 days, we need to read an average of pages per day. So, the number of pages read per day is:

pages/day = total pages / number of days = 612 / 6 = 102 pages/day"
Response:  The book has 555 pages and is divided into 22 chapters. Each chapter contains approximately 25 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 555 x 22 = 12100 pages. Now, let's calculate how many days it would take to read the entire book at an average reading speed of 2 hours per day: 12100 pages / 2 hours/day = 6050 days or approximately 17 years. So, each chapter takes approximately 17 years to complete.
Response:  The book has 193 pages and there are 15 chapters in it. To calculate the average number of pages per chapter, we divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters: 193 / 15 = 12.87 (round off to 13). So each chapter has approximately 13 pages on an average. Now, if the book is read for 66 days, we need to multiply the number of pages per chapter with the number of chapters and then multiply that result by the number of days: 13 x 15 x 66 = 2048. Therefore, the person reads approximately 2048 pages in 66 days.
Response:  We know that each book has 249 pages and takes 3 days to read. So, in total, there are 249 x 3 = 747 pages to be read. Now, let's calculate how many books can be read in one day: 747 pages / 3 days = 249 pages per day. Therefore, in one day, you can read 249 pages of books.
Response:  We know that each book takes 66 days to read and there are 12 books in total. So, it will take 792 days (66 x 12 = 792) to finish reading all the books. However, if we assume that someone reads one book every day, then it will take them 492 days (365 days + 128 days = 492 days) to finish reading all the books. Therefore, the correct answer is 492 days.
Response:  The book is divided into 16 days, and each day has 8 chapters. So, in total, there are 16 x 8 = 128 chapters in the book. Now, if we assume that each chapter takes approximately 1 hour to read, then the total time required to finish reading the entire book would be 128 chapters x 1 hour/chapter = 128 hours or 5.3 days (128 hours / 24 hours per day). Therefore, it will take around 5.3 days to finish reading the entire book.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 pages in each book and we have to count the number of words in all books together. So, if there are 576 books, then the total number of words in all books is:

Number of pages in one book = 8
Total number of pages in 576 books = 576 x 8 = 4512

Now, let's calculate the total number of words in all books:
Total number of words in all books = Total number of pages in all books x Number of words per page
= 4512 x 30 (average number of words per page)
= 135,360 words

So, it would take approximately 135,360 / 8 = 16,900 days or around 45 years to read all the books in the library if each book has an average of 30 words per page."
Response:  The book has 450 pages and takes 30 days to read. So, each day you will have to read approximately 15 pages (450/30 = 15). Now, let's assume that you take one break of 15 minutes every hour to relax your eyes and mind. In an hour, you will have read 6 pages (15 minutes \* 6 pages/minute), so in total, you will have read 90 pages per day (15 pages + 6 pages/hour). Therefore, in 30 days, you will have read a total of 2700 pages (90 pages/day x 30 days).
"Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 594 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:
3 x 594 = 1782 pages
Now, we need to divide this number by 607 to find out how many days it would take to read the entire book:
1782 pages / 607 days = approximately 2.95 days per page
So, if someone reads one chapter every day, it would take them approximately 2.95 days to finish reading the entire book."
"Response:  We know that there are 45 pages in each book and there are 64 books in total. So, the total number of pages in all the books is:

45 x 64 = 2800 pages

Now, we need to find out how many days it would take to read all the books if each person reads for 4 hours every day.

4 hours/day x 30 days = 120 hours

So, the total time required to read all the books is:

2800 pages / 120 hours = 23.33 days (approximately)"
Response: 120 dollars is equal to how many Indian rupees? To convert USD to INR, we need to use the current exchange rate. As of today (June 6th), the exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = 70 INR. So, 120 USD x 70 INR/USD = 8400 INR. Therefore, each pack of 120 cigarettes costs around 8400 INR.
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money will be required for each pack of 81 dollars and then multiply it with the number of packs needed. So, we need to find out how many packs can fit in 33 dollars.  To do this, we need to divide the cost of one pack (81 dollars) by the price per dollar (1 dollar = 81 cents). Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

Number of packs that can fit in 33 dollars = 81 dollars / 0.81 cents = 100 packs
So, if you want to buy 33 dollars worth of Pokémon cards, you will need 100 packs."
Response:  We know that each Devi is worth $107 and there are 93 Devis in total. So, if we want to calculate how many Devis one Pakwa can buy with $93, we need to divide $93 by $107.  Therefore, one Pakwa can buy approximately 86 Devis with $93.
Response:  If each pack of Deviated Cereals costs $76 and there are 25 cents in a dollar, then we can calculate the cost per pack as follows: Cost per pack = $76 / $1 = $76 So, if you buy one pack of Deviated Cereals, you will have to pay $76. Now, let's assume that you want to know how much money you will save if you buy all seven packs at once instead of buying them individually. To do this, we need to calculate the total cost of all seven packs when bought together: Total cost = $76 x 7 = $508 So, if you buy all seven packs at once, you will save $262 ($508 - $76) compared to buying them individually.
Response:  We know that there are 104 dollars in Tom's account.  Now, we need to calculate how many packs of Devi's tea Tom can buy with this amount.  Each pack of Devi's tea costs $26. So, if Tom wants to buy one pack of Devi's tea, he will have to spend $26. Therefore, the number of packs of Devi's tea Tom can buy with his $104 is: Number of packs = $104 / $26 = 4 packs
"Response:  We have two dice with different numbers of dots (spots) on them. One die has 28 spots and the other has 36 spots. To find out how many times the second die can roll more than the first die, we need to count the number of ways in which the second die can roll a higher number than the first die.

There are six possible outcomes for rolling one die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since both dice have different numbers of spots, there are six possible outcomes for each die as well. So, the total number of possible outcomes is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Now, let's count the number of ways in which the second die can roll a higher number than the first die. There are three possibilities for the first die: 2, 5, or 8. For each of these possibilities, there are four possible outcomes for the second die: 3, 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, the number of ways in which the second die can roll a higher number than the first die is:

$3 \times 4 = 12$

So, the probability that the second die will roll a higher number than the first die is:

$12 / 36 = 0.33$

Answer: The probability that the second die will roll a higher number than the first die is $0.33$."
Response:  We know that there are 18 coins in total and each coin has a diameter of 2 cm. So, the area of one coin is: Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the coin. Since the radius of each coin is half the diameter, we can calculate the radius as follows: Radius = Diameter / 2 = 2 cm / 2 = 1 cm. Now, we need to find out how many coins fit inside a circle with an area of 18 cm^2. To do this, we divide the area of the circle (18 cm^2) by the area of one coin (πr^2): Number of coins = Area of circle / Area of one coin = 18 cm^2 / (π x 1 cm^2) = 18 / π = approximately 6.3 coins. Therefore, there are approximately 6.3 coins that fit inside a circle with an area of 18 cm^2.
Response:  We know that there are 187 boxes in total and each box contains 140 gats. So, we have to find out how many gats are present in all the boxes together. To do this, we need to multiply the number of boxes with the number of gats in each box. Therefore, the total number of gats in all the boxes is: 187 x 140 = 25,960 gats.
Response:  We have to find out the area of each circle and then add them up to get the total area of all circles. The radius of each circle is given as 203/7 = 29 inches. So, the diameter of each circle is 2 x 29 = 58 inches. Now, we need to find the area of each circle using the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Therefore, the area of each circle is: Area = π(58)^2 = 1451.2 square inches. Since there are 203 circles in total, the total area of all circles is: Total area = 203 x 1451.2 = 293,356.4 square inches.
"Response:  We have to find out how many gats (units) are there in each of the 142 villages and then calculate the total number of gats.  For this, we need to know the size of each village.  If each village has an average area of 47 acres, then the total area of all 142 villages is:

Area of all 142 villages = 142 x 47 = 6,384 acres

Now, let's find out how many gats are there in each village. According to the question, there are 356 santries in each village, and each santry contains 178 gats. Therefore, the total number of gats in each village is:

Number of gats in each village = Number of santries x Number of gats per santry
= 356 x 178
= 60,956 gats

So, the total number of gats in all 142 villages is:

Total number of gats = Total area of all villages x Number of gats in each village
= 6,384 x 60,956
= 3,767,728 gats

Therefore, there are approximately 3,767,728 gats in all 142 villages."
"Response:  We know that there are 196 ghatas in Filippe's collection and each gatha has 392 letters. So, the total number of letters in all the gathas is:

196 x 392 = 78,504 letters

Therefore, the answer is 78,504 letters."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 shapes in the collection of Filippo's stamps. Each shape has a different area. So, if we want to find out how many gaps there are between the shapes, we need to calculate the area of each shape and then subtract it from the total area of all the shapes.
Let's assume that the total area of all the shapes is x square units. Then, the area of each shape is x/18 square units. Since there are 18 shapes, the sum of their areas is 18x/18 = x. Therefore, the number of gaps between the shapes is x - x = 0. So, there are no gaps between the shapes."
"Response:  The total number of circles in the collection is 87 and each circle has 93 parts. So, the total number of parts in all the circles together is:

87 circles x 93 parts per circle = 8241 parts

Therefore, there are approximately 8241 parts in the entire collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 384 saints in total and 192 of them have been recognized as great saints. So, among the remaining 160 saints, each one has contributed at least 345 gathas (verses). Therefore, the number of gathas contributed by each saint is:

$$ \therefore \text{Number of gathas contributed by each saint} = \frac {384}{192} \times \frac {160}{345} = 7 $$
So, each saint has contributed approximately 7 gathas."

Response:  We have to find out how many biscuits Aishwarya can make in one hour if she makes 22 biscuits per minute and there are 17 minutes in an hour. So, we need to divide the number of biscuits made per minute by the number of minutes in an hour. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of biscuits Aishwarya can make in one hour = (22 biscuits/minute) / (60 minutes/hour) = 360 biscuits/hour
Response:  If Brand A has 10 cups of coffee and gives away 3 cups to Customer X, then it will have 7 cups left (10 - 3 = 7). Now, if Customer Y buys 2 cups from Brand A, then it will have 5 cups left (7 - 2 = 5). So, in total, Brand A will have sold 9 cups of coffee (7 + 2 = 9).
"Response:  We have to find out how many cups of coffee Brenda can drink in one day if she takes two cups every hour. So, we need to calculate the total number of hours in a day and then multiply it with the number of cups per hour.  Therefore, the answer is:

Total hours in a day = 24 hours
Number of cups per hour = 2 cups/hour
So, the total number of cups of coffee Brenda can drink in a day = Total hours in a day x Number of cups per hour
= 24 hours x 2 cups/hour
= 48 cups of coffee
Therefore, Brenda can drink 48 cups of coffee in a day."
Response:  We have to find out how many biscuits each person can eat in one sitting and then multiply it with the number of people present. So, let's assume that each person can eat 2 biscuits at once. Now, there are 10 people present. Therefore, the total number of biscuits that each person can eat is:  Number of people = 10  Number of biscuits per person = 2  Total number of biscuits that each person can eat = Number of people x Number of biscuits per person = 10 x 2 = 20 biscuits.
Response:  We have 42 chocolates and we want to distribute them equally among two people. So, each person will get 42/2 = 21 chocolates.
Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of candy are there in total and then calculate the number of candies per pile.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 26 piles of candy, and each pile has 33 pieces of candy.  Now, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy: Total Number of Pieces of Candy = Number of Piles x Number of Candies per Pile Total Number of Pieces of Candy = 26 x 33 = 840 Now, we can see that there are 840 pieces of candy in total.  To answer the second part of the question, we need to divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of piles: Number of Candies per Pile = Total Number of Pieces of Candy / Number of Piles Number of Candies per Pile = 840 / 26 = 32 So, there are 32 candies in each pile.
Response:  We have 33 chocolates and each chocolate has 9 pieces. So, total number of pieces = 33 x 9 = 297 pieces. Now, we are asked how many pieces of each type of chocolate there will be if each piece is divided equally among 24 people. Total number of people = 24. Number of pieces per person = Total number of pieces / Number of people = 297 / 24 = 12.5 pieces per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 12.5 pieces of chocolate.
"Response:  We have to find out how many chocolates are there in each bag and then calculate the total number of chocolates.  Each bag contains 11 chocolates. So, if we have 22 bags, the total number of chocolates will be:  Number of chocolates in each bag = 11 Chocolates per bag = 22 Bags = Total number of chocolates = 

Please let me know if you want me to explain the solution or if you have any questions!"
Response:  We have two bags of chocolates - one with 16 chocolates and another with an unknown number of chocolates.  Since we don't know how many chocolates are in the second bag, let's assume that it contains x chocolates. Now, if we randomly select one chocolate from each bag, the probability of selecting a chocolate from the first bag is 1/16, since there are only 16 chocolates in total. Similarly, the probability of selecting a chocolate from the second bag is also 1/x, since there are only x chocolates in total. Therefore, the probability of selecting at least one chocolate from both bags is equal to the sum of these probabilities: 1/16 + 1/x = (1+1/x)/16. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  We have 25 boxes of trail mix and we want to fill each box with 14 pieces of trail mix. So, how many total pieces of trail mix will fit in all 25 boxes?  To find out, we can divide the total number of pieces of trail mix (25 x 14 = 350) by the number of boxes available (25). Therefore, there are approximately 350 pieces of trail mix that can fit in all 25 boxes.
Response:  We have 10 boxes of chocolates and we want to distribute them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 2 boxes of chocolates (10/5 = 2).
Response:  If there are 67 small balls and 9 large balls, then the total number of balls is 67 + 9 = 76. Now, if we take 1/3 of the small balls (which is equal to 20), then we have taken 20/3 = 6.67 small balls. Since there are 9 large balls, taking 1/3 of them gives us 9 x 1/3 = 3 large balls. So, in total, we have taken 6 + 3 = 9 balls. Therefore, the remaining 57 small balls and 8 large balls are left over.

We know that there are 22 bats in one kilogram of silver, so we can calculate it as follows: 220 bats x 22 bats/kg = 48 kg of silver Therefore, if you have 220 bats, you would have approximately 48 kilograms of silver.
Response:  We know that 30 bottles of oil are sold at Rs.8 each and 41 bottles of oil are sold at Rs.6 each. So, total amount earned from selling these bottles is: 30 x Rs.8 = Rs.240 + 41 x Rs.6 = Rs.246 Total amount earned = Rs.486 Therefore, there are 486 bottles of oil sold in total.
Response:  We know that 79 bottles of oil are sold at Rs. 53 each, and we have to find out how many bottles of oil are left after selling 42 bottles. So, total amount earned from selling those 79 bottles is:  Total amount = Number of bottles x Price per bottle = 79 x 53 = Rs. 4017. Now, if we sell 42 more bottles, the remaining amount will be: Remaining amount = Total amount - Amount earned from selling additional bottles = Rs. 4017 - (Number of additional bottles x Price per additional bottle) = Rs. 4017 - (42 x 53) = Rs. 4017 - 2268 = Rs. 1749. Therefore, there are 1749 bottles of oil left after selling 42 bottles.
Response:  The first shop sold 54 batteries at Rs. 3 each, and the second shop sold 83 batteries at Rs. 2 each. So, the total amount of money earned by both shops is: Shop 1 : 54 x Rs. 3 = Rs. 162 Shop 2 : 83 x Rs. 2 = Rs. 166 Total amount of money earned = Rs. 162 + Rs. 166 = Rs. 330 Therefore, there are 330 batteries in total.
Response:  We have 17 balls in total and we want to know how many data points are there in the remaining 9 balls after 29 throws.  Since each ball has 4 sides (up, down, left, right), there will be 4^9 = 6561 possible combinations of data points for the remaining 9 balls. So, the number of data points is 6561.
Response:  The first 19 balls were hit with a normal speed of 60 km/h and took 3 seconds to reach the boundary. Now, we need to find out how many balls will be hit in 60 minutes (or 3600 seconds) at this speed.  To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance is the length of the ground, which is assumed to be 250 meters for simplicity. So, the total distance covered in 60 minutes would be: Distance = 250 m x 3600 s = 875,000 m.  Now, let's assume that the batsman hits each ball with an equal probability of success. Therefore, the average number of boundaries hit per minute can be calculated as follows: Average Boundaries Hit Per Minute = Total Distance / Time Taken = 875,000 m / 3600 s = 248.75 boundaries per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the average number of boundaries hit per hour can be calculated as follows: Average Boundaries Hit Per Hour = Average Boundaries Hit Per Minute x Number Of Minutes In An Hour = 248.75 boundaries per minute x 60 minutes = 14,875 boundaries per hour.
Response:  We know that 72 bottles are filled with water and 32 bottles are empty. So, in total, there are 104 bottles (72 filled + 32 empty). Now, we need to find out how many full bottles are there. Since 72 bottles are filled with water, so the number of full bottles is 72. Therefore, the number of empty bottles is 32 - 72 = -40.
Response:  We know that 36 bottles of oil are sold at Rs.80 each, and 54 bottles of diesel are sold at Rs.70 each. So, the total amount earned from selling these two types of fuel is: Oil : 36 x Rs.80 = Rs.2880 Diesel : 54 x Rs.70 = Rs.3780 Now, let's find out how many bottles of each type were sold: Total number of bottles sold = Number of oil bottles + Number of diesel bottles = 2880 + 3780 = 6660 Bottles Therefore, there were 6660 bottles in total.
Response:  We have 30 balls in total and we want to distribute them equally among 28 people. So, each person will get 1 ball. Now, let's assume that there are some remaining balls which we don't know how many they are. Let's call them X. Then, the number of balls left with us is 30 - X. Since we want to distribute these balls equally among 28 people again, each person will get (30 - X) / 28 = X/28 balls. Therefore, the answer is X/28.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of oil are needed to fill up the tank with 79 liters more than what is already filled in it. So, we need to subtract 79 liters from the total capacity of the tank. The capacity of the tank is given as 40 liters, so the total capacity including the already filled amount is: Capacity = 40 liters + (79 liters x 1) = 40 liters + 79 liters = 119 liters Now, we know that we need to fill up the tank with 79 liters more than what is already filled in it, so we can calculate the number of bottles of oil required as follows: Number of bottles = Total capacity / Capacity of one bottle = 119 liters / 5 liters (capacity of one bottle) = 23.8 bottles Therefore, we need approximately 23.8 bottles of oil to fill up the tank with 79 liters more than what is already filled in it.
Response:  We know that 57 batteries are sold at $26 each and 27 batteries are sold at $27 each. So, the total amount of money spent is: $$57 \times 26 = 1482$$ + $$27 \times 27 = 709$$ = $$2191$$ Now, we have to find out how many batteries were sold in total. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of money spent by the price of one battery: $$ \frac {2191} {26} = 83$$ batteries were sold in total. Therefore, there were 83 batteries sold in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many liters of diesel are required for 81 batters (batteries) and how much light is produced from those batteries. From the given information, we know that 60 batters produce 81 liters of diesel and 60 batters produce 60 liters of light. So, if we want to find out how many liters of light are produced from 81 batters, we can use the following formula: Light Produced = Number of Batters x Amount of Light Produced per Battery Therefore, the number of liters of light produced from 81 batters would be: Light Produced = 81 x 60 = 4860 liters
Response:  We have to find out how many bats are in total and then calculate the percentage of normal bats and defective bats.  Total number of bats = 49 bats Normal bats = 40 bats (36 + 4) Defective bats = 9 bats (4 - 4) Percentage of normal bats = (Total number of bats / Number of normal bats) x 100% = (49 / 40) x 100% = 87.5% Percentage of defective bats = (Number of defective bats / Total number of bats) x 100% = (9 / 49) x 100% = 18.4% So, there are 87.5% normal bats and 18.4% defective bats.

So, the total number of people who took bakery products from the store is:  Number of people = Total number of days x Number of people per day  Therefore, the answer is:  People who took bakery products = 703 x (246 + 25) = 703 x 271 = 185,930 people
Response:  We know that there are 666 days in a year. Now, we have to find out how many of those days are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).  From the given information, we can see that during these 100 days, there were 66 days with bakis (bakis meaning Saturdays or Sundays in Marathi). So, the number of weekend days during this period is 66/7 = 9.  Therefore, there are 9 weekend days in each of the 100 days.
Response:  We know that there are 327 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we divide the total number of polio cases (1325) by the number of days in a year (327), we get an average of 406 polio cases per day. Therefore, the answer is 406.
Response:  We know that there are 85 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 85 days with 24 hours per day, we get 2070 hours in a year. Now, let's calculate how many hours Bakinigham Polesla spent on his work during one year. According to the question, he worked for 45 days straight without any break, which means he worked for 45 x 24 = 1080 hours in one year. Therefore, the number of hours Bakinigham Polesla spent on his work during one year is 2070 - 1080 = 990 hours.
"Response:  We know that there are 71 chambers in Bakinigham Palace and each chamber has 557 people staying in it during Diwali festival. So, the total number of people staying in Bakinigham Palace during Diwali is:

$$ \therefore Total\space people = 71\times 557 = 39,671 $$
Now, we need to find out how many more people come for Diwali compared to the average daily visitors during other days. The question states that the average daily visitors during other days are $57$ per day, so:

$$ \therefore More\space people = Total\space people - Average\space daily\space visitors = 39,671 - 57 = 39,614 $$
Therefore, the number of additional people who come for Diwali is $39,614$."
Response:  We know that there are 39 penthouses in Bakinigham Palace and each penthouse has 6 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in Bakinigham Palace is 39 x 6 = 234 rooms. Now, we need to find out how many tourists visited Bakinigham Palace during Diwali. According to the question, 661 tourists visited Bakinigham Palace during Diwali. Therefore, the number of tourists who visited Bakinigham Palace per day during Diwali is 661 / 7 = 95 tourists per day.
Response:  We know that there are 92 people who have completed their meals and 419 people who are yet to complete their meals. So, out of these 511 people, how many will be able to eat their meals in the remaining time of 1 day (i.e., 24 hours)? To find this, we need to divide the total number of people who haven't eaten their meals ( i.e., 419) by the time left for them to finish their meals (i.e., 24 hours). Therefore, the number of people who can eat their meals in the remaining time is : 419 / 24 = 17.So, out of the total 511 people, only 17 people will be able to eat their meals in the remaining time of 1 day.
Response:  We know that there are 512 poles in one mile and there are 471 miles between two divides. So, we have to find out how many poles are there between these two divides.

So, let's calculate it as follows: Total amount of sugar = 166 grams Number of grams consumed = 20 grams Remaining amount of sugar = Total amount of sugar - Number of grams consumed = 166 g - 20 g = 146 g Therefore, there are 146 grams of sugar left after consuming 20 grams.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of sugar are in 557 grams of chocolate. So, we need to divide 557 grams by 100, which gives us 5.57 grams per gram. Now, we know that there are 17 grams of sugar in one chocolate bar, so we can multiply 17 grams by 5.57 grams/gram to get the total number of grams of sugar in one chocolate bar. Therefore, there are approximately 89 grams of sugar in one chocolate bar.
Response:  We have 11 grams of cheese and we want to know how many grams of water are needed to make it into one cup (8 fluid ounces). So, first, we need to convert 11 grams to cups. To do this, we divide 11 grams by the density of cheese, which is approximately 1 gram per milliliter (g/mL). Therefore, 11 g / 1 g/mL = 11 mL. Now, we need to convert 11 milliliters to cups. There are 8 fluid ounces in a cup, so we can divide 11 mL by 8 fl oz to get the number of cups: 11 mL / 8 fl oz = 0.975 cups. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1 cup. Therefore, there are 1 cup of water needed to make 1 cup of cheese.
"Response:  We know that there are 94 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we calculate the total number of hours in a year, it will be:

Now, let's find out how many dram (a unit of measurement for time) there are in a year:
1 dram = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds
So, the total number of dram in a year will be:
2267 hours/year x 1800 seconds/dram = 3951200 seconds/year
Therefore, Dararoja can perform 3951200 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 658600 minutes in a year."
Response:  We know that there are 266 days in a year and each day has 9 hours (including night). So, total number of hours in a year is: 266 x 9 = 2384 hours. Now, let's calculate how many drops of water can fill up an ocean: 1 drop = 0.001 liters (as we assume the volume of one drop to be very small). Therefore, total number of liters of water that can fit into an ocean is: 10^18 liters (which is the volume of an average-sized ocean). Now, let's convert this value from liters to hours: 10^18 liters / 1 liter per hour = 10^18 hours. Finally, we divide the total number of hours in a year by the number of hours it takes for an ocean to fill up with water: 2384 hours / 10^18 hours = 0.0000000002% (or 0.00000002%). This means that if all the water in the world were to flow into the ocean at a rate of 1 drop per second, it would take approximately 0.0000000002% of the total time available in a year to fill up the entire ocean.
Response:  We know that there are 294 days in a year and each day has 8 hours (assuming a standard working day). So, total working hours in a year is: 294 x 8 = 2306 hours. Now, let's calculate how many hours Tyagi worked in a year: 2306 hours / 146 days = 15.7 hours per day (on average) Since we know that he worked for 29 years, total number of working hours can be calculated as follows: 15.7 hours/day x 29 years = 4359.3 hours Total number of working hours including weekends and holidays would be higher than this value since he didn't work every day of those 29 years. However, without more information about his work schedule it's difficult to provide an exact figure.
Response:  We know that there are 235 days in a year and each day has 8 hours (assuming a standard working day). So, the total number of hours in a year is: 235 x 8 = 1860 hours. Now, we need to calculate how many hours Tyagi spent studying during his lifetime. According to the question, he studied for 235 days straight without taking any break, so he studied for a total of: 235 x 8 = 1860 hours. However, this calculation assumes that he studied continuously for all 235 days without any breaks. But as per the question, he took a break of 10 days every month, which means he didn't study for 10 days out of those 235 days. Therefore, the actual time Tyagi spent studying is: 235 - 10 = 225 days. And since each day has 8 hours, the total number of hours Tyagi spent studying is: 225 x 8 = 1760 hours. Finally, we need to convert these hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 1760 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 104920 minutes.
"Response:  We know that there are 57 steps in total and each step has a height of 25 cm. Therefore, the total height of all 57 steps is:

$$ \text{Total volume} = 252 \times 108 = 26944 \text{ liters} $$
Now, let's divide the total volume of water by the total height of the stairs to find out how many drums are needed to fill up the entire height of the stairs:

$$ \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Total height}} =? $$
Solving for $,$ we get:

$$ \boxed{ \frac{26944}{1375} = 19 } $$
Therefore, it will take 19 drums to fill up the entire height of the stairs."
Response:  We know that there are 36 gole (units) in one draaksh (measurement). So, if we have to find out how many days it takes for 240 drams of water to fill up a tank, we need to divide the total number of drams by the number of gole in one draaksh. Therefore, 240 drams / 36 gole = 6.94 days. Hence, it will take approximately 6 and half days for 240 drams of water to fill up a tank.

Response:  We have 78 blocks in total and each block has 30 houses. So, we have 78 x 30 = 2340 houses in total. Now, let's calculate how many mailboxes are needed for each house. Since there is one mailbox per 19 houses, we need 2340 / 19 = 125 mailboxes. Therefore, there will be 125 mailboxes in total.
Response:  We have 55 blocks in total and each block has 8 houses. So, we have 55 x 8 = 440 houses in total.
Response:  We have 8 blocks of size 4x4 each, and we want to find out how many janks (or boxes) can fit in one block. Since each block has 16 squares, and we need at least 4 squares for each box, we can fit 4 boxes in one block. Now, let's calculate how many blocks we can get if there are 81 houses in total. If we divide 81 houses by 4 boxes per block, we get 20.25 blocks (round up to 20 blocks). So, there will be 20 blocks with 4 boxes each, which means there will be 80 janks (or boxes) in total.
Response:  We have 16 blocks and each block has 4 houses. So, in total we have 16 x 4 = 64 houses. Now, each house requires 3 melons, so the total number of melons required is 64 x 3 = 192 melons.
"Response:  We have 10 red balls and 20 blue balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of matching colors are there. Since each ball can be paired with only one other ball of the same color, the number of pairs is equal to the total number of balls divided by 2. So, the number of pairs of matching colors is:

$$ \frac {10}{2} = 5 $$

Therefore, there are 5 pairs of matching colors among the 30 balls (10 red + 20 blue)."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 bullets and 15 balls in total. Now, let's calculate how many gats (groups) we can make with these numbers:

To make one gat, we need to arrange 3 bullets and 2 balls together. So, if we have 10 bullets, we can make 10/3 = 3 groups of bullets. Similarly, if we have 15 balls, we can make 15/2 = 7 groups of balls.

Now, we need to combine both groups - bullets and balls. Since each group has 3 bullets and 2 balls, we can make 3 x 7 = 21 groups overall. Therefore, there are 21 gats in total."
"Response:  We have 11 gats in total. Each ghat has two andis (or steps). So, we need to count how many andis are there in each ghat. If we divide the number of andis in each ghat by 2, we get the number of andis for that particular ghat. Now, let's calculate the total number of andis for all the 11 gats.

So, the final answer is:

Number of andis = Total number of gats x Number of andis per ghat
= 11 x 2
= 22"
Response:  We have 4 bags of rice and each bag contains 8 kg of rice. So, in total we have 4 x 8 = 32 kg of rice. Now, there are 6 big bags of rice and each big bag contains 60 kg of rice. Therefore, the total weight of all the big bags is 6 x 60 = 360 kg.  So, the difference between the total weight of small bags (32 kg) and large bags (360 kg) is 358 kg.
Response:  We have 3 bags of rice and each bag contains 4 kg of rice. So, in total, we have 3 x 4 = 12 kg of rice. Now, there are 15 grains in one gram, so there are 12 / 15 = 800 grams of rice in each bag. Therefore, the number of grains in each bag is 800 grams / 1000 (to convert to kilograms) = 0.8 kg or 800 grams.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 cans of Rebekah's beer, each containing 720 ml and 66 bullets in total. Now, we need to find out how many grams of alcohol are present in all these cans. To do this, we need to multiply the volume of each can (in milliliters) by the density of ethanol (which is approximately 0.79 g/ml). So, for one can of Rebekah's beer:

Volume of one can = 720 ml
Density of ethanol = 0.79 g/ml
Alcohol content in one can = Volume of one can x Density of ethanol
= 720 ml x 0.79 g/ml
= 543 grams
Now, let's sum up the total amount of alcohol present in all 18 cans:
Total alcohol content = Number of cans x Alcohol content per can
= 18 x 543 grams
= 9,574 grams
Therefore, there are approximately 9,574 grams of alcohol present in all 18 cans of Rebekah's beer."
Response:  We have 3 bags of rice and each bag contains 99 kg of rice. So, in total, we have 3 x 99 = 297 kg of rice. Now, there are 100 kg of rice more than what is required to fill all three bags. Therefore, the number of bags that can be filled with 297 kg of rice is: Number of bags = Total weight of rice / Weight of one bag = 297 kg / 99 kg/bag = 3 bags.
Response:  We know that there are 20 racks of rebar in each bundle and each bundle contains 6 buds. So, the total number of rebar = Number of bundles x Number of racks per bundle = 5 x 20 = 100 rebar. Therefore, there are 100 rebar in one bundle.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 rebeckas in total and each rebeka contains 5 gole (units) and 12 anndis (units). So, we have:

Total number of rebeckas = 20
Number of gole in each rebeka = 5
Number of anndis in each rebeka = 12
Now, to find out how many more anndis are present in all the rebeckas, we need to subtract the number of anndis in each rebeka from the total number of anndis. So, we have:

Total number of anndis = Number of anndis in each rebeka x Total number of rebeckas
= 12 x 20
= 240
So, there are 240 more anndis present in all the rebeckas than the number of anndis in each rebeka."
Response:  The triangular game has 154 pieces and each piece weighs 1 gram. If we take 11 grams of each piece, then how many pieces can be made? So, the answer is 137 pieces (154 x 0.11 = 137).
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 46 is divisible by each of the numbers from 1 to 177. So, we need to divide 177 by 46 and get the quotient. Now, we will check if that quotient is equal to or greater than 1. If it is, then that number is divisible by 46 exactly once. Otherwise, it is not divisible by 46 at all. Therefore, the total number of times 46 is divisible by each of the numbers from 1 to 177 is given by the sum of these quantities. Using this logic, we can calculate the answer as follows:

Quotients of division of 177 by 46:

1 / 46 = 3 (exact)
2 / 46 = 0 (not divisible)
3 / 46 = 1 (exact)
4 / 46 = 0 (not divisible)
5 / 46 = 1 (exact)
6 / 46 = 0 (not divisible)
7 / 46 = 1 (exact)
8 / 46 = 0 (not divisible)
9 / 46 = 1 (exact)
10 / 46 = 0 (not divisible)
...
177 / 46 = 3 (exact)

Therefore, there are 3 times when 46 is divisible by each of the numbers from 1 to 177."
Response:  We have two ferries with 84 passengers each. Each passenger has one luggage piece. So, in total, we have 168 pieces of luggage (84 passengers x 2 luggage per person). Now, let's assume that each piece of luggage has an equal chance of being lost or found. Therefore, the probability of any particular piece of luggage being lost is also 1/168, and the probability of it being found is also 1/168.
Response:  We know that there are 146 features in each of the two cars. So, if we combine both cars, there will be a total of 292 features (146 x 2 = 292). Now, let's assume that out of these 292 features, 157 are common to both cars. This means that only 135 features (292 - 157 = 135) are unique to one car or the other. Therefore, the answer is 135.
Response:  We have to find out how many triangles are there in each of the three shapes given in the question.  For triangle, we know that it has 3 sides and 3 angles. So, if we draw a triangle with side length x, y, and z, then its area will be A = (x \* y) / 2. Similarly, the perimeter of a triangle is P = a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides. Now, let's analyze each shape given in the question:  Shape 1: The shape given in the question is an equilateral triangle with side length 2. Since all the sides are equal, we can write a = b = c = 2. Therefore, the area of this triangle is A = (a \* b) / 2 = (2 \* 2) / 2 = 4. The perimeter of this triangle is P = a + b + c = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.  Shape 2: The second shape given in the question is a right triangle with hypotenuse 3 and legs of length 2 and 5. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse as follows: c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where a = 2, b = 5. Substituting these values, we get c = sqrt(2^2 + 5^2) = √7. Therefore, the area of this triangle is A = (c \* sin(θ)) / 2 = (√7 \* sin(60°)) / 2 = 3.927. The perimeter of this triangle is P = a + b + c = 2 + 5 + √7 = 12.  Shape 3: The third shape given in the question is an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 3 and 5. Since one of the legs is longer than the other by 2 units, we can say that a = 3 and b = 5 - 2 = 3. Therefore, the area of this trapezoid is A = (a \* b) / 2 = (3 \* 3) /
Response:  There are two friends, A and B, who have to share 32 losses equally between them. Since they have already shared their profits equally, we can assume that each friend has won or lost an equal number of games. So, if A has won x games and lost y games, then B has also won x games and lost y games. Therefore, the total number of games each friend has played is 2x + 2y = 64 (since there are 64 games in total). Now, let's find out how many losses each friend has. If A has won x games, then he has lost 64 - x games. Similarly, if B has won y games, then he has lost 64 - y games. We want to know how many losses each friend has, so we need to subtract the number of wins from the total number of games played. For A, this means subtracting x from 64, which gives us 64 - x. For B, it means subtracting y from 64, which gives us 64 - y. Finally, since both friends have an equal number of losses, we can say that A has 32 losses and B has 32 losses as well.
Response:  We know that Amilie has 11 friends and each friend of hers has lost 28 motyas (coins). So, in total, Amilie's 11 friends have lost 28 x 11 = 308 coins. Now, we are asked how many coins Amilie herself has lost. Since she is not one of her friends, she hasn't lost any coin. Therefore, Amilie has not lost any coins.
"Response:  If there are 8 losses and each loss has 16 motes, then the total number of motes lost is:

8 losses x 16 motes per loss = 128 motes

So, Emily loses 128 motes in total."
Response:  We know that Emily has 18 friends and each friend of hers lost 6 motyas (coins). So, in total, Emily lost 18 x 6 = 108 motyas. Now, we need to find out how many motyas each friend of Emily lost. Since there are 5 friends of Emily who did not lose any motya, they lost 0 motyas. Therefore, the number of motyas each of the remaining 13 friends of Emily lost is: 13 x 6 = 78 motyas.
"Response:  We have to find out how many motyas are there in total and then divide it by 5 to get the average number of motyas per har. So, let's calculate the total number of motyas first. From the question, we know that there are 100 motyas in each har. Since there are 5 har, the total number of motyas is:
Total Number of Motyas = 100 x 5 = 500
Now, we need to divide the total number of motyas by 5 to get the average number of motyas per har:
Average Number of Motyas per Har = Total Number of Motes / 5 = 500 / 5 = 100
So, there are 100 motyas in each har."
Response:  We have 72 friends and we want to give them gifts equally. So, each friend will get 6 gifts (since there are 6 options). Now, since each gift contains 3 items, the total number of items that Emily can give is: 6 x 3 = 18. Therefore, Emily can give 18 gifts to her 72 friends.
Response:  We have 43 friends and we want to distribute them equally among 5 groups of 8 each. So, each group will have 8 friends. Now, let's calculate how many friends each friend will have in total. If there are 20 harassment cases, then each friend will have 20/43 = 0.467 (approximately) harassment cases. Therefore, the answer is 0.467.
Response:  We know that Emily has 44 friends and she lost 26 of them. So, the number of friends Emily has left is 44 - 26 = 18. Now, each friend of Emily had to give her 2 motyas as compensation for every loss. Therefore, the total amount of money Emily received from all her friends is 18 x 2 = 36.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 819056 people who have not received any loan from the government and 668277 people who have received loans. So, if we want to find out how many more people have received loans than those who haven't received any loans, we need to subtract the number of people who haven't received any loans from the total number of people who have received loans. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is: 819056 - 668277 = 150789.  Hence, approximately 15 lakh (or 150789) more people have received loans than those who haven't received any loans.
"Response:  We know that Shibira has 202958 rupees in her account and she spends Rs 77762 on rent. So, we can calculate how much money is left with her after paying the rent as follows:

Money left with Shibira = Total amount in her account - Amount spent on rent
= 202958 - 77762
= 125196

So, there are 125196 rupees left with Shibira after paying the rent."

"Response:  We know that there are 907611 houses in Mumbai and each house has an average area of 250 square meters. So, the total area of all the houses in Mumbai is:

$$ \text {Total Area} = \frac{907611}{455682} \times 250 = 375575500 \square meters $$
Now, let's calculate the number of Lorries needed to transport all these materials:

$$ \text {Number of Lorries} = \frac{\text {Total Area}}{Lorry Capacity} $$
We assume that each Lorry can carry $3000$ cubic meters of material. Therefore, the capacity of one Lorry is:

$$ \text {Capacity of One Lorry} = 3000 \sqrt[3]{m^3} $$
Substituting this value into our previous equation, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text {Number of Lorries}} = \frac{375575500}{3000 \sqrt[3]{m^3}} = 1255555 \approx 1256000 $$
Therefore, approximately $1256000$ Lorries would be required to transport all the construction materials needed for building just the houses in Mumbai!"

Now, let's calculate the number of Lorries needed to transport all these people:

400000 / 12 (as each lorry can carry 12 passengers) = 3333.33

So, approximately 3333 Lorries would be required to transport all the people living in those 80000 houses."
Response:  We know that there are 616179 homes in the area of Lorraine and each home has an average of 3 rooms. So, the total number of rooms in Lorraine is 616179 x 3 = 1849597 rooms. Now, we need to find out how many rooms are occupied by Lorraine residents. According to the question, 616179 people live in Lorraine, and each person occupies an average of 2 rooms. Therefore, the total number of occupied rooms in Lorraine is 616179 x 2 = 1232358 rooms. So, among the 1849597 rooms in Lorraine, 1017239 (1232358 - 616179) rooms are occupied by Lorraine residents.
Response:  We know that there are 34,444 houses in Shibirala and 13,476 of them have electricity connections. So, the number of houses without electricity connections is 34,444 - 13,476 = 20,968.
Response:  We know that there are 6175969 people in the city and 5907796 people live outside of it. So, the number of people who have left their homes is (6175969 - 5907796) = 2284373.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 homes in the area of ​​the first larceny and 893835 homes in the area of ​​the second larceny. Therefore, the total number of homes affected by both larcenies is equal to the sum of these two numbers, i.e., 644997 + 893835 = 1538832. Since the area of ​​the third larcency is 78 square miles, we can calculate the number of homes affected by it as follows: Number of homes affected by the third larceny = Area of ​​the third larceny x Population density of the third larceny / Total population of the area where all three larcenies occurred. Population density of the third larceny = (Number of homes affected by the third larceny) / (Area of ​​the third larceny x Number of homes per square mile). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Population density of the third larceny = (78 sq mi x 1538832 homes / 100%) = 116606 homes per square mile. Now, let's find out how many homes were affected by each larceny: Number of homes affected by the first larceny = 644997 homes. Number of homes affected by the second larceny = 893835 homes. Number of homes affected by the third larceny = 116606 homes. So, the total number of homes affected by all three larcenies is equal to the sum of these three numbers, i.e., 644997 + 893835 + 116606 = 1658498 homes.
Response:  We know that Admadkad has 3 jackets and 9 shirts. So, if we want to find out how many total items he has, we can add the number of jackets and shirts together. Therefore, Admadkad has 3 + 9 = 12 items in total.
Response:  Admadkadhe has 10 safar chand and Jackiepeak has 2 safar chand. So, the difference between their number of safar chand is 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, Admadkadhe's jackpot will have 8 more safar chand than Jackiepeak's jackpot.

"Response:  We know that Jackie has traveled for 10 hours and Adam has traveled for 8 hours. To find out how much longer Jackie took to travel than Adam, we need to subtract the time taken by Adam from the time taken by Jackie. So, the difference between their travel times is:

Time taken by Jackie - Time taken by Adam = 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours

Therefore, Jackie took 2 hours more than Adam to travel the same distance."
Response:  We know that Adam and Eve had 6 children. Each of their children had two parents, so in total we have 2 x 6 = 12 people. Now, each of these 12 people had two parents, so in total we have 2 x 12 = 24 people. And so on... So, the number of generations from Adam to Jack is 24.
Response:  We know that Adam and Eve traveled for 9 days to reach the promised land. And they had one son every year, until their death. So, in total, there are 7 sons. Therefore, the number of safar chand (days) is 7 x 7 = 49 days.
Response:  We know that Adam and Eve walked for 12 stages.  Now, we need to find out how many steps they took in each stage.  According to the question, Adam took 9 steps and Jack took 8 steps. So, Adam took 9 x 1 = 9 steps and Jack took 8 x 1 = 8 steps. Therefore, there are 9 + 8 = 17 steps taken by both Adam and Jack together.
Response:  We know that Adi has traveled for 4 days and Jackie has traveled for 10 days. So, the total distance traveled by both of them together is 4 + 10 = 14 days. Now, we need to find out how many kilometers they have traveled in 14 days. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. Here, the speed of Adi is 20 km/day and the speed of Jackie is 30 km/day. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both of them together in 14 days is: Distance = (20 km/day) x (4 days) + (30 km/day) x (10 days) = 800 km + 3000 km = 3800 km.
Response:  We know that there are 89 saints and 11 safar chand (or travelers) in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them have traveled to Admakdede. To do this, we can divide the number of safar chand by the number of saints who have not traveled to Admakdede. So, we get: Number of safar chand = 11 / (89 - 5) = 11 / 84 = 0.01367958... Approximately 1.37% of the saints have traveled to Admakdede. Therefore, the answer is 1.37%.

Therefore, the number of biscuits Helena has today is 484 - 39 = 445 biscuits.
Response:  Helena had 527 chocolate chips and made 86 rice krispies treats. Today she has 86 rice krispies treats and 554 chocolate chips. So, Helena gave away 309 chocolate chips (554 - 86 = 309).
Response:  Helena had 144 chocolate chips and 397 rice krispies to share among her friends. Today she has 85 rice krispies and 403 chocolate chips left. So, Helena gave away 69 rice krispies (85 - 144) and 294 chocolate chips (397 - 144).
Response:  Helena had 19 chocolate chips in her cookie jar and added 231 more today. So, the total number of chocolate chips in her cookie jar now is 250 (19 + 231).
Response:  Helene had 197 chocolate chips and 46 rice krispies in her kitchen when she started baking. Today, after baking for 75 minutes, she has 75 more rice krispies (i.e., 75 x 2 = 150) and 3 times as many chocolate chips (i.e., 3 x 197 = 581). So, today Helene has 581 chocolate chips and 150 rice krispies in total. Now, let's calculate how many chocolate chips are there per biscuit: Total number of chocolate chips = Number of chocolate chips before baking + Number of chocolate chips added during baking Total number of rice krispies = Number of rice krispies before baking + Number of rice krispies added during baking Biscuits made with these ingredients = Total number of chocolate chips / Total number of biscuits Biscuit size = Total number of rice krispies / Total number of biscuits Since we know that Helene made 75 biscuits today, we can find out how many chocolate chips are there per biscuit by dividing the total number of chocolate chips by the number of biscuits she made: Number of chocolate chips per biscuit = Total number of chocolate chips / Number of biscuits made = 581 / 75 = 7.74 chocolate chips per biscuit. Therefore, there are approximately 7.74 chocolate chips in each biscuit made by Helene today.
Response:  In 1951, Helena Hippopotamus and her friend Helen Chippy had 519 chocolate chips and 300 rice krispies. Today, they have 280 rice krispies and 359 chocolate chips. To find out how many more rice krispies Helena has today than she did in 1951, we need to subtract the number of rice krispies she had in 1951 from the number of rice krispies she has today. So, the difference between the two numbers is 280 - 519 = -239 rice krispies. Therefore, Helena has 239 fewer rice krispies today than she did in 1951.

Response:  We know that there are 84 new friends and 19 June birthdays in one group of friends. Similarly, we know that there are 8 new friends and 69 June birthdays in another group of friends. Now, let's find out how many new friends have the same birthday as any friend in either group. To do this, we need to find the number of common days between these two groups. There are 30 days in June, so the total number of common days is:  Number of common days = 30 (June) x (Number of friends with June birthdays in both groups) = 30 x 12 = 360 Common days Now, let's count the number of friends who share their birthday with at least one friend in either group: Total number of friends = 84 + 69 = 153 Friends who share their birthday with at least one friend in either group = Total number of common days / Total number of friends = 360 / 153 = 2.37 friends Therefore, approximately 2.37 friends in each group share their birthday with at least one friend in the other group.
Response:  We know that Ketaki has 62 new friends and Junun has 80 new friends. So, the total number of new friends for both is 62 + 80 = 142. Now, we need to find out how many june (a unit of measurement) are there in 142. To do this, we can divide 142 by 30 (as there are 30 junes in one month). Therefore, there are 142 / 30 = 4.7 junes in 142.
Response:  Ketaki has played 57 games and scored 63 goals. To find out how many goals she has scored per game, we need to divide the total number of goals by the number of games she has played. So, Ketaki has scored 1 goal per game.
Response:  We know that Ketaki has 57 new friends and 39 old friends. Her friends gave her 34 new gifts. So, we need to find out how many gifts each friend gave.  To do this, we can divide the total number of new gifts (34) by the number of old friends (39). This gives us an average of 0.86 gifts per old friend. Now, let's apply this average to Ketaki's 57 new friends. If she had 57 new friends, then she would have received an average of 0.86 x 57 = 47.2 gifts from them. Therefore, the answer is 47.
Response:  Firstly, Jeshn has $60 in his account and he spends $33 on buying a car. So, now he has $27 left in his account. Then, he gets $19 from his father as an advance. Now, his total balance is $46 ($27 + $19). Finally, he pays $5 for insurance, so his new balance is $41 ($46 - $5). Therefore, Jeshn paid $5 for insurance.
Response:  Fred has $86 in his account and gives $5 to Jason. So, Fred now has $81 left in his account. Since Jason doesn't have any money in his account initially, he gets nothing from Fred. Therefore, the amount of money that Jason receives is zero.
Response:  Firstly, Fred has $19 dollars and Jessica has $16 dollars. If they share equally, each of them will get $9.50 (=$19 / 2). Now, if they buy a car worth $400 (=$80 x 5), then Fred will have to pay $320 (=$400 - $9.50) and Jessica will have to pay $279 ($=400-$9.50). So, Fred will have $320 left after buying the car and Jessica will have $279 left.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $114 in his account and Jessica has $220 in her account. Now, let's calculate how much money each of them can withdraw from their accounts. According to the question, Fred can withdraw up to $85, and Jessica can withdraw up to $78. So, the total amount of money they can withdraw is:
Fred's withdrawal = $85
Jessica's withdrawal = $78
Now, let's see how much money they actually withdrew. From the question, we know that Fred withdrew $35, and Jessica withdrew $21. Therefore, the remaining balance in their accounts after withdrawing the mentioned amounts is:
Fred's remaining balance = $85 - $35 = $50
Jessica's remaining balance = $220 - $21 = $199
So, the final amount of money that Jessica had in her account after withdrawing $21 was $199."
Response:  Firstly, Fred has $1110 in his account and he withdraws $400. So, now he has $710 left in his account. Then, Jason takes out $115 from Fred's account without his permission. Now, Fred's balance is reduced to $695. Finally, Jason returns $44 of the money that he took without permission, so now Fred has $739 in his account. Therefore, Fred made $289 ($739 - $44) in cash.
Response:  Fred has $49 in his account and gives $3 to Jason. So, Fred now has $46 left in his account. Then, Jason gets $112 from Fred's account, so Jason now has $158. Now, let's calculate how much money each person has after the transaction:  After the transaction, Fred has $46 + ($112 - $3) = $70 left in his account. And Jason has $158 - $3 = $155. Therefore, the final amount of money that each person has is:  Fred has $70, and Jason has $155.
Response:  Firstly, Fred has $78 in his account and he withdraws $31 from it. So, now he has $47 left in his account. Then, Jason gives him $14 as a loan. Now, Fred has $61 in his account. Finally, Freed takes out $90 from his account to pay off his debt to Jason. Therefore, the amount of money that Freed owes to Jason is $90 - $61 = $29.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Fred made from his job and investments. From the question, we know that he earned $33 per hour at his job and invested $95 in stocks. Therefore, his total income can be calculated as follows: Income from Job = $33 x 20 hours/week = $660 per week Income from Stocks = $95 x 5 years = $4750 Total Income = $660 + $4750 = $5410 Now, let's find out how much money Fred spent on various things. He spent $16 on groceries, $74 on car maintenance, and $18 on entertainment. Therefore, his total expenses can be calculated as follows: Expenses = $16 + $74 + $18 = $108 So, now we need to find out how much money Fred has left after paying all his expenses. To do this, we subtract his expenses from his total income: Money Left After Expenses = Total Income - Expenses = $5410 - $108 = $5302 Finally, we can see that Fred has $5302 left after paying all his expenses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $47 is the amount of money that Fred has in his wallet and he wants to share it equally among 99 people. So, each person will get $\frac{47}{99} = \boxed{\$0.48}$ as their share. Now, let's calculate how much money Jessica will receive from Fred's wallet. Since she is one of the 99 people, her share will be $\boxed{\$99\times\$0.48} = \$48.64$. Therefore, Fred will give Jessica $\boxed{\$48.64}$ from his wallet.
"Response:  Jessica weighed 71 kg before she started jogging regularly. If she lost 20 kg after jogging for some time, her current weight would be:

Current weight = Original weight - Lost weight
= 71 kg - 20 kg
= 51 kg

So, Jessica's current weight is 51 kg."
Response:  Jessie weighs 27 kg initially and loses 10 kg in weight through jogging. So, his new weight is 27 - 10 = 17 kg. Now, let's calculate how much he will lose per day if he continues to jog at the same rate. Since he has lost 10 kg in one week (i.e., 7 days), he will lose half of that amount every day, i.e., 5 kg per day. Therefore, after 10 days of jogging, he will have lost a total of 5 x 10 = 50 kg.
Response:  Jessie weighs 126 kg and wants to lose weight. If he starts jogging regularly, his weight will decrease gradually. Let's assume that for every kilometer run, he loses 0.5 kg of weight. So if he runs 126 kilometers (which is approximately equal to 78 miles), he will lose 63 kg of weight (since 126 x 0.5 = 63). Therefore, after completing 126 kilometers of jogging, Jessie's weight will be reduced to 63 kg.
Response:  Jessie lost 35 kg in one year. If she had a BMI of 40 before losing weight, her BMI after losing weight would be:  BMI = (weight / height²) x 703  After losing 35 kg, Jessie's weight decreases to 69 kg. Now we can calculate her BMI as follows:  BMI = (69 / (1.7 m²)) x 703  = approximately 48.2  So, Jessie's BMI after losing weight is around 48.2.
Response:  Jessica weighed 114 kg initially and lost 50 kg in the first year of her weight loss journey. So, her weight after one year would be 114 - 50 = 64 kg. Now, she gained some weight back and reached a weight of 72 kg after two years. Therefore, her final weight after two years is 72 - 64 = 8 kg less than her initial weight of 114 kg.
Response:  Firstly, Jesica weighed 9 kilos at birth and gained 620 grams per day in her first year of life. Therefore, she would have gained a total weight of 620 x 365 = 227,800 grams or approximately 228 kilograms during her first year of life. Now, let's calculate how much weight Jesica lost after turning six months old. According to the question, Jesica lost 140 grams per day from her daily weight gain of 620 grams. So, over a period of 6 months (i.e., 180 days), Jesica would have lost a total weight of 140 x 180 = 23,400 grams or approximately 23.4 kilograms. Thus, the final weight of Jesica after turning six months old is 228 - 23.4 = 204.6 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, Jesica gained 56 kg weight during her pregnancy and after delivery, she lost 32 kg of weight which is equal to 98% of her initial weight gain. So, initially she weighed 92 kg. Now, let's calculate how much weight she lost in each of the two periods:  Period 1 (Before Delivery): Weight loss = Initial weight - Final weight = 92 kg - 56 kg = 36 kg  Period 2 (After Delivery): Weight loss = Final weight - Initial weight = 56 kg - 36 kg = 20 kg Therefore, Jesica lost 20 kg of weight in the second period, which is equal to 43% of her total weight loss.
Response:  We have 95 apples and 61 oranges. If we take away 64 apples from the total quantity of fruits, how many apples will be left? Well, if we subtract 64 from 95, we get 31. So, there are 31 apples left after taking away 64 apples from the total quantity of fruits.
Response:  We know that in Prāṇī-Sangraha-alaya (PSA), there are 93 cells and each cell has 40 divisions. So, in total, PSA contains 93 x 40 = 3680 cells. Now, we need to find out how many cells are not alive after 97 days. To do this, we will divide the number of non-alive cells by the total number of cells. Therefore, the percentage of non-alive cells is:  Non-alive cells / Total cells x 100 = 3680 / 3680 x 100 = 100%.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 3 and 75 can be multiplied together to give us 82.  So, we need to divide 82 by 3 and 75 respectively.  Divide 82 by 3 = 27  Divide 75 by 3 = 25  Now, let's see how many times 25 can be divided into 27.  We know that 25 can be divided into 27 exactly 3 times.  Therefore, the number of times 3 and 75 can be multiplied together to give us 82 is 3 x 3 = 9.
Response:  We have 79 pigeons and we need to find out how many of them are left after 24 hours and 51 days.  After 24 hours, all the pigeons will be alive, so the number of alive pigeons is 79. Now, let's calculate the number of dead pigeons in 51 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of days is 51 / 24 = 2.0833... days. So, the number of dead pigeons is 79 - 24 = 55. Therefore, after 51 days, 55 pigeons will be dead, leaving us with 24 alive ones.
Response: 171 years have passed since the invention of the first tomato. If we start counting from 134 AD (the year when tomatoes were first cultivated), then today is 2023 AD. So, the answer is 171 years.
Response:  The time period is 56 years and today's date is April 4th. So, let's calculate how many tomatoes would have grown during this time frame.  Tomato plants typically take around 70-80 days to mature after planting. Assuming an average of 75 days, if we plant tomato seeds in spring (which is around late March or early April), then the first harvest would be around mid-June. Now, if we assume that there are 160 tomato plants per bed, and each bed has 20 feet length, then the total number of tomato plants would be: Number of tomato plants = Total area of the garden / Area per bed x Number of beds  Number of tomato plants = 160 x 20 = 3200 tomato plants If we multiply the number of tomato plants with the number of tomatoes produced per plant (assuming an average yield of 10 tomatoes per plant), we get: Total number of tomatoes = Number of tomato plants x Number of tomatoes produced per plant  Total number of tomatoes = 3200 x 10 = 32,000 tomatoes Therefore, based on the calculation above, it can be estimated that approximately 32,000 tomatoes would have grown in the garden over the course of 56 years, assuming one tomato plant per foot and 160 tomato plants per bed.
Response: 154 years have passed since 1867, and today is 2023. Therefore, if we calculate the number of tomatoes that grew in those 154 years, it would be: Number of Tomatoes = Total time (in years) x Rate of growth per year In this case, the rate of growth per year can be assumed to be an average value, which may vary depending on various factors such as climate change, agricultural practices, etc. For simplicity, let's assume an average annual growth rate of 2%. Now, let's plug in the values: Number of Tomatoes = 154 years x 2% per year = 30.8 Tomato plants To convert this result from plants to actual tomatoes, we need to consider the average yield of a single tomato plant. This can also vary based on factors like soil quality, water availability, sunlight exposure, etc. Assuming an average yield of 10-15 kg/plant (kilo grams per plant), we get: Actual Tomatoes = 30.8 plants x 10-15 kg/plant = 308-450 kg tomatoes Finally, to convert this quantity into tons, we divide by 1000: Tons = 308-450 kg / 1000 = 0.308-0.45 tons So there were approximately 0.308-0.45 tons of tomatoes grown during the period of 154 years, assuming an average annual growth rate of 2% and an average yield of 10-15 kg/plant.
Response:  We have 175 tomatoes and 77 bags of 10 tomatoes each. To find out how many bags we can fill with 172 tomatoes, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes by the capacity of each bag. So, 175 tomatoes / 10 tomatoes per bag = 17 bags. Therefore, we can fill 17 bags with 172 tomatoes.
Response:  We have 177 bags of rice and 12 bags of wheat. If we take 53 tomatoes from each bag of rice, how many tomatoes will be left in each bag?  So, for every 177 bags of rice, there are 53 tomatoes taken, which means that 126 tomatoes are left in each bag (177 - 53 = 126). Similarly, if we take 12 bags of wheat, then there are 12 x 53 = 630 tomatoes taken, leaving 630 - 12 = 618 tomatoes in each bag of wheat.
Response:  We have 105 eggs and we want to fill 71 tomato bags with an equal number of eggs in each bag. So, we need to divide 105 eggs equally among 71 bags. To do this, we can divide 105 by 71, which gives us 1.48 eggs per bag. Since we cannot have a fraction of an egg left over, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1 egg per bag. Therefore, 137 tomato bags will contain 1 egg each, leaving 69 bags empty.
Response:  We have four pieces of furniture (bed, table, chair, and shelf) in each room. If we want to arrange them in such a way that no two pieces of furniture are facing each other, how many different ways can we do it?  There are 4! = 24 possible arrangements for one piece of furniture, since there are four positions you can place it in (up, down, left, or right). So, the number of different ways to arrange four pieces of furniture is 4! x 3! = 1680 possible arrangements. However, some of these arrangements may not be feasible due to spatial constraints, so the actual number of unique arrangements might be lower.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cubes of size 17 are required to fill 8 cubes of size 13.  To do this, we need to divide 8 by 17.  So, the number of cubes of size 17 that fit in one cube of size 13 is:

$$ \frac{8}{17} = \boxed{0.46} $$

Now, since there are 13 cubes of size 13 and each cube has 17 smaller cubes inside it, the total number of smaller cubes inside all 13 cubes is:

$$ 13 \times 0.46 = \boxed{5.52} $$

So, John has $5.52$ cubes of size 8 hidden inside his house."
Response:  We know that there are 11 fruits in total and we need to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 2.75 fruits (11 / 4 = 2.75). Now, let's consider John's share. Since he is alone, he will get all 11 fruits (11 x 1 = 11). Therefore, John has 11 fruits.
Response:  We know that there are 12 mandirs and each mandir has 10 lakh lockers. So, in total, there are 12 x 10 = 120 lakh lockers. Now, we need to find out how many hawkers are present near these mandirs. According to the question, every 15 lockers have one hawker, so we can calculate the number of hawkers as follows: Number of hawkers = Total number of lockers / 15 (as per the question) = 120 lakh / 15 = 80 thousand hawkers. Therefore, there are 80 thousand hawkers near the temples.
"Response:  We know that each fence has two nails and there are 16 fences in total. So, the number of nails required to fix all the fences is:

2 x 16 = 32 nails

Therefore, John needs 32 nails to fix all the fences around his house."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the seven days in a week repeats itself in a year.  There are 52 weeks in a year.  So, we can calculate as follows: Monday - 7 x 52 = 364 Tuesday - 7 x 52 = 364 Wednesday - 7 x 52 = 364 Thursday - 7 x 52 = 364 Friday - 7 x 52 = 364 Saturday - 7 x 52 = 364 Sunday - 7 x 52 = 364 Therefore, there are exactly 364 repetitions of each day of the week in a year.
Response:  We know that there are 12 big boxes and 17 small boxes. Each big box contains 14 pieces of fruit, so there are 12 x 14 = 168 pieces of fruit in total from big boxes. Similarly, each small box contains 25 pieces of fruit, so there are 17 x 25 = 425 pieces of fruit in total from small boxes. Therefore, the total number of fruits John has is 168 + 425 = 593 fruits.
Response:  We know that each package contains 3 tukdes and there are 42 packages in total. So, we can calculate the number of tukdes in all packages as follows: Number of tukdes = Total number of packages x Number of tukdes per package = 42 x 3 = 126 tukdes Therefore, there are 126 tukdes in all packages.
"Response:  We know that there are 43 cards in total and each pack contains 23 cards. So, we have:

Total number of cards = Number of packets x Number of cards per packet
= 43 x 23
= 1005

Now, we are asked how many games can be played with these cards. Since there are 8 additional cards, we can play:

Number of games = Total number of cards / Number of cards required for one game
= 1005 / 76 (as each game requires 76 cards)
= 13.5 games

So, approximately 13.5 games can be played with these 43 decks of cards."
Response:  We know that each pack of Robinsons has 7 tukdes. So, in total, there are 41 tukdes in all the packets of Robinson (6 + 7 = 13). Therefore, there are 13 packets of Robinson.
"Response:  We have:

* Number of robins = 28
* Number of eggs per robin = 3
* Number of packages per egg = 4

So, total number of packages = 28 x 3 = 84 packages."
Response:  We know that there are 21 robins in total and each bird lays 3 eggs. So, the number of eggs laid by all birds is: 21 x 3 = 63 eggs. Now, we know that each package contains 9 eggs. Therefore, the number of packages is: 63 / 9 = 7 packages.
"Response:  We know that there are 28 robins in total and each bird lays 6 eggs. So, the number of eggs laid by all birds is:

28 x 6 = 168 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many eggs are in each package. As per the question, each package contains 14 eggs. Therefore, the number of packages needed to contain all the eggs is:

168 / 14 = 12 packages

So, there are 12 packages containing 14 eggs each, which means there are 168 eggs in total."
Response:  We have to make three shirts in one minute. So, we need to divide 60 (the number of minutes) by 3 (the number of shirts). Therefore, the machine can produce one shirt in 20 minutes (60/3 = 20).
Response: 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. So, in one minute, 4 shirts can be made if each shirt takes 15 seconds to make (4 x 15 = 60). Therefore, 240 shirts can be made in an hour (60 x 4 = 240).
Response:  The time taken to make 3 shirts in one minute is 3/60 = 1/20 minutes. Now, there are 44 shirts made today, so the total time taken to make all of them is 44 x 1/20 = 2.2 hours (or 1 hour and 40 minutes).
Response:  The first shirt took 13 minutes to make and now there are 3 shirts made in total. So, each shirt takes 4.33 minutes (13/3) to make. Now, if one minute is equal to 60 seconds, then we can calculate the time taken for one shirt as follows: Time taken = Number of shirts x Time per shirt = 3 x 4.33 minutes = 12.99 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 12.99 minutes to make 3 shirts.
Response:  The time taken to make one shirt is 9 minutes and now it takes 8 minutes. So, if we want to know how many minutes the machine worked today, we need to subtract the time taken to make two shirts (9 - 8 = 1 minute). Therefore, the machine worked for 1 minute today.
Response:  The machine can make 3 shirts in 1 minute and it took 4 minutes to make 8 shirts today. So, the number of minutes the machine worked is:  Minutes = (Number of shirts made / Time taken to make one shirt) x Total time taken to make all shirts  Minutes = (8 / 3) x 4 = 24 minutes
Response:  The machine can produce shirts in 12 minutes and has been working for 8 hours (i.e., 480 minutes). So, it has produced = 480/12 = 40 shirts.
Response:  The machine can produce shirts at a rate of 12 per minute. So in 5 minutes, it will make 60 shirts (12 x 5 = 60). Now let's calculate how many shirts it will make in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one hour, the machine will make 60 x 60 = 3600 shirts.
Response:  The person has been working for 5 days and earned $165 per day. Therefore, the total amount earned in 5 days is: $165 x 5 = $825. So, the person has earned $825 in 5 days.
Response:  The person has $144 to spend during their vacation for 22 days. To calculate how much they can spend per day, we need to divide the total amount by the number of days: $144 / 22 = $6.59 per day So, the person can spend approximately $6.59 per day during their vacation.
"Response:  The person has been playing carnival games for 30 days and earned $420 per day. Therefore, the total amount earned in 30 days is:
$420 x 30 = $12,600
Now, let's calculate how much Ring Toss game contributed to the overall earnings:
Ring Toss game contribution = Total earnings / Number of days played (in this case, 30 days)
= $12,600 / 30
= $420 per day
So, the Ring Toss game accounted for $420 out of the total daily earnings of $12,600, which is approximately 33% of the total earnings."
Response:  Karniwalamadhe (Karnival) is a 44-day event that starts from January 15th and ends on February 26th. During this period, Ring Toss Game earned $440 in total and lost $374. So, the net profit of the game during Karnival was $66 ($440 - $374).
Response:  The first 20 days of January had 31 days and the last 16 days had 7 days. So, total number of days in January = 31 + 7 = 38 days. Now, let's calculate the profit for each day: Profit per day = Total profit / Number of days = $120 / 38 days = $3.20 per day. Therefore, Karniwal made a profit of $3.20 per day during the first 20 days of January.
Response:  The first transaction was made on January 15th, and it took 32 days to complete. So, the total amount spent during this period is $32 \times 32 = $968. Now, let's calculate the daily expenditure for these 32 days: $968 / 32 = $30.63 per day. Therefore, Karnivalam spent $30.63 per day from January 15th to February 14th.
Response:  Lucia has 10 packets of chocolates and she gave 4 packets to her friend. So, now Lucia has 6 packets left (10 - 4 = 6). Now, let's assume that each packet contains 5 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Lucia has 6 x 5 = 30 pieces of chocolate left with her.
Response:  We have 4 packets of chocolates (22 pieces each), and we want to know how many packets are left after selling 16 packets. To find out, we need to divide the total number of chocolates by the number of packets sold: Number of packets left = Total number of chocolates / Number of packets sold = 80 chocolates / 16 packets = 5 packets So, there are 5 packets of chocolates left after selling 16 packets.
Response:  We have 23 packets of chocolates and we want to know how many packets are left after selling 17 packets. So, the number of packets left = Total packets - Number of packets sold = 23 - 17 = 6 packets.
Response:  Lucia bought 2 packets of chocolates at Rs. 10 each and 12 packets of candies at Rs. 8 each. Therefore, she spent a total of Rs. 2 x 10 = Rs. 20 + Rs. 12 x 12 = Rs. 96. So, Lucia spent a total of Rs. 126 on sweets.
Response:  We have 12 buses and each bus can carry 36 passengers. So, in total, we have 12 x 36 = 432 passengers that can be carried by all the buses together. Therefore, there are 432 passengers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 people in total and 4 of them can fit in the bus. So, the number of people who cannot fit in the bus is 7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, 3 people cannot fit in the bus.
"Response:  We have 13 buses and each bus can carry 4 passengers. So, total number of passengers that can be carried by all the buses together is :

13 x 4 = 52

So, there are 52 passengers in total who can be carried by all the buses."
Response:  We know that there are 7 stations in total between two points A and B. If we assume that each station has an equal number of passengers (11), then the total number of passengers who boarded or got off at each station can be calculated as follows: Station 1: 11 passengers x 7 stations = 77 passengers Station 2: 11 passengers x 6 stations = 66 passengers Station 3: 11 passengers x 5 stations = 55 passengers Station 4: 11 passengers x 4 stations = 44 passengers Station 5: 11 passengers x 3 stations = 33 passengers Station 6: 11 passengers x 2 stations = 22 passengers Station 7: 11 passengers x 1 station = 11 passengers Therefore, the total number of passengers who boarded or got off at each station is: Station 1: 77 passengers Station 2: 66 passengers Station 3: 55 passengers Station 4: 44 passengers Station 5: 33 passengers Station 6: 22 passengers Station 7: 11 passengers So, there were 11 passengers who boarded or got off at each of the 7 stations between point A and point B.
"Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in each class and then calculate the total number of students.  So, we can start with the information given in the question that there are 22 classes and 676 students in total.  Now, let's assume that each class has an equal number of students.  Therefore, the number of students in each class is:

Number of students per class = Total number of students / Number of classes
= 676 / 22
= 30.91 (approximately)
So, approximately 30-31 students are there in each class."
Response:  We have 73 palaks (workers), and among them, there are 724 students and 744 teachers. So, if we divide the number of workers by the total number of people in that workplace, we get: Number of workers per person = 73 / (724 + 744) = 1/9 = 0.1111... Approximately, or about 11.11% of the total population in that workplace is made up of workers.
"Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in total and then compare it with the number of palaks (peons) working in the school. So, we need to multiply the total number of students by 50 to get the approximate number of peons required to serve them. Therefore, the answer is:
Approximate number of peons required = Total number of students x 50
= 174 x 50
= 8700"
Response:  We know that there are 61 palaks and 177 students in this program. Out of these, 44 locals have participated in the program. So, we can say that out of every 61 palaks, 44 participate in the program. Therefore, the number of locals who did not participate in the program is (61 - 44) = 17.
Response:  We know that Guheshwari is a game of dice where you roll two six-sided dice and add their numbers to get your score. So in this case, if you rolled a 919 and your opponent rolled a 1307, then your total score would be 919 + 1307 = 2226. Therefore, the difference between your scores is 2226 - 1307 = 919.
Response:  We have two quantities - 1218 feet and 849 feet. To find the difference between them, we need to subtract one from the other. So, the difference is: 1218 - 849 = 369 feet.
Response:  The distance between two points is given as 659 feet and 762 feet. To find the difference between these two distances, we can use the formula: Distance = Final distance - Initial distance. In this case, the final distance (762) is greater than the initial distance (659), so the difference in distance is: Difference = 762 - 659 = 83 feet. Therefore, the difference in height between the two points is 83 feet.
Response:  We know that Bhartiya Mahanagar Palika (BMP) has given permission to Sonali Bank to construct a building in Pune. The height of the building is 8 floors. If each floor has 8 goldfish, then the total number of goldfish in the building will be 8 x 8 = 64 goldfish. Since BMP has allowed only 8 golden fishes per floor, we can conclude that 64 - 8 = 56 goldfish are not allowed inside the building. Therefore, out of 64 goldfish, 56 goldfish cannot swim in the building's pond.
"Response:  We have 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in a pond with an area of 15 square meters. To calculate how many days it would take for all the fish to eat up the food, we need to consider the amount of food available per day. Assuming that each goldfish eats half its body weight in food daily (which is a reasonable assumption), then the total daily food consumption of 7 goldfish would be:
Goldfish food consumption = 7 x 0.5 kg/day = 3.5 kg/day
Similarly, assuming that each catfish eats 1.5 times its body weight in food daily (also a reasonable assumption), then the total daily food consumption of 12 catfish would be:
Catfish food consumption = 12 x 1.5 kg/day = 18 kg/day
Now, let's calculate how long it would take for all the fish to eat up the entire food supply:
Total food supply = 7 + 12 = 19 kg
Time taken to consume entire food supply = Total food supply / Daily food consumption
= 19 kg / (3.5 kg/day + 18 kg/day)
= 19 kg / 21 kg/day
= 0.9 days
Therefore, it would take approximately 0.9 days or 96 hours for all the fish to eat up the entire food supply in the given pond."
Response:  We have 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. If we take out 2 more fish from the pond, then the number of goldfish left will be 14 (16 - 2). So, there are 70 catfish left in the pond (71 - 2 = 70).
Response:  We have 15 goldfish in total and we want to know how many are left after 5 of them died. So, initially there were 15 - 5 = 10 goldfish alive. Now, we need to find out how many goldfish are left after another 5 die. So, the remaining goldfish will be 10 - 5 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 goldfish left after 5 more die.
Response:  We have two tanks with different capacities - Tank A has capacity of 43 liters and Tank B has capacity of 87 liters. If we fill both tanks equally, then how many liters will be filled in each tank?  Therefore, the number of liters filled in Tank A is 43/2 = 21.5 liters. Similarly, the number of liters filled in Tank B is 87/2 = 43.5 liters. So, there are 21.5 liters in Tank A and 43.5 liters in Tank B.
Response: 58 - 35 = 23 So, there are 23 saffron threads left after 35 have been used.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 40 can be divided into 54 without leaving any remainder.  To do this, we need to divide 54 by 40 and see if there are any remainders left over.  So, let's divide 54 by 40: 54 / 40 = 1.35714286... (round off to 1.36) Now, as you can see, there is no remainder left over after dividing 54 by 40. Therefore, the number of times that 40 can be divided into 54 without leaving any remainder is 1.
Response:  We have to find out how many acceleration factors are present in each shell of the structure.  There are 11 shelves in total, and each shelf has 4 bins. So, there are 40 bins in total. Now, we need to find out how many acceleration factors are present in each bin. Since there are 40 bins, and each bin can hold 40 acceleration factors, therefore, the total number of acceleration factors that can be stored in each shelf is 4 x 40 = 160. Therefore, the total number of acceleration factors that can be stored in all 11 shelves is 11 x 160 = 1760.
Response:  We have to find out how many shells are there in each box of Adam's chocolates. The question states that there are 10 boxes of Adam's chocolates and each box contains 8 shells. So, we can conclude that there are 80 shells (10 boxes x 8 shells/box) in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many vases are there in each shelf and then sum them up.  There are 8 shelves, and each shelf has 4 vases. So, the total number of vases is 8 x 4 = 32.
Response:  We know that there are 544 bags of rice and each bag contains 32 full measures (or 32 ful). So, we need to find out how many full measures are there in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of bags with the number of full measures per bag: 544 x 32 = 17608 Full Measures Now, we want to know how many full measures are there in total. Therefore, we divide the total number of full measures by the number of bags: 17608 / 544 = 32.5 Full Measures So, there are approximately 32.5 full measures of rice in total.
"Response:  We have 466 balls in total. Each ball weighs 53 grams and has a diameter of 181 millimeters. To find out how many full balls (i.e., without any holes) we have, we need to divide the total weight of all balls by the weight of one full ball. So, 

Total weight of balls = 466 x 53 = 24,098 grams
Weight of one full ball = 53 grams
Number of full balls = Total weight of balls / Weight of one full ball
= 24,098 / 53
= 450 full balls
Now, let's find out how many half-balls (i.e., with some hole) we have. Since each ball has a diameter of 181 millimeters, if it has a hole of radius r, then its volume will be reduced by (4/3) \* pi \* r^3. Therefore, the number of half-balls is equal to the total weight of balls minus the weight of full balls. So,

Number of half-balls = Total weight of balls - Number of full balls
= 24,098 - 450
= 23,648
Therefore, there are 23,648 half-balls."
"Response:  We have 141 balls in total and each ball weighs 71 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the balls is:

141 balls x 71 grams/ball = 9,611 grams

Now, let's convert this weight to kilograms:

9,611 grams / 1000 grams/kilogram = 9.611 kilograms

So, there are approximately 9.611 kilograms of balls."
Response:  We know that there are 40 full moons in a year. So, if we divide 40 by 12, we get 3.33 years for one full moon to appear again. Therefore, there will be approximately 3.33 x 12 = 40 full moons in 1 year.
Response:  We have 4502 skittles in total and 4276 are red. So, there are 150 blue skittles.
Response:  We have 391 skittles in total and we want to know how many are in each of the 495 bags. So, if there are x skittles in each bag, then the total number of skittles in all bags is 391 / x. Now, since there are 495 bags, we can write an equation: 391 / x = 495. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, each bag contains 7 skittles.
Response:  We have 896 skittles in total and we want to know how many are in each of the 517 bags. So, the number of skittles in each bag is 896 / 517 = 1.74 skittles per bag.
Response:  We have 270 students in total and we want to divide them into 5 groups of equal size. So, we need to find out how many students each group can accommodate. To do this, we will use division.  Division is used to divide a quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 270 students into 5 groups.  So, we will divide 270 by 5 = 54. Therefore, each group can accommodate 54 students.
Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in each class and then multiply it with the total number of classes. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Students = Total Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Now, we know that there are 304 classes and 75 students in each class. Therefore, we can plug these values into our equation to get: Number of Students = 304 x 75 = 22,800 students. Thus, there are approximately 22,800 students in this school.
