"Response: 
Julia played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Monday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday.

So, let's do that:

12 - 11 =?

The difference is 1. So, Julia played with one more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday."
Response: 10 (Julia played with 5 children on Monday and added 10 more on Tuesday to make a total of 15).
Response: 14 (the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday) - 16 (the total number of children she played with) = 2 (the number of children Julia played with on Monday).
Response: 12 + 16 = 28.
Response: 8 + 14 = 22.
"Response: 
Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children in total."
"Response: 
Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 children on Monday and Tuesday."
"Response: 
Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 15 children on Wednesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Wednesday than on Monday, we can subtract 5 from 15:

15 - 5 = 10

So, Julia played with 10 more children on Wednesday than on Monday."
"Response: 
Julia played with 14 + 16 = 30 children on Tuesday and Wednesday."
Response: 7 - 9 = 2. Julia jugó con 2 más niños el lunes que el martes.
Response: 6 (14 - 8 = 6)
Response: 2 more children played with Julia on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
Response: 25 (18 + 15 - 7) = 25.
"Response: 
Julia played with 13 + 10 = 23 children in total."

Response: 20 pieces of candy.
Response: 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy did Bobby eat.
Response: 33 + 4 = 37 (pieces of candy) and 14 (pieces of chocolate).
"Response: 38 + 36 = 74 (total number of candies eaten)
74 - 16 = 58 (number of candies more than chocolate eaten)"
Response: 34 + 18 = 52. Bobby ate 52 pieces of candy.
Response: 7 (seven) pieces of candy remain for Bobby after eating 5 and then 9 more.
"Response: 13 (pieces of candy)
Explanation:
Let X be the number of pieces of candy that Bobby had initially.
We know that he ate some pieces and then ate 5 more.
So, the total number of pieces of candy eaten by Bobby is:
X + 5
Since Bobby has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up an equation:
X + 5 = 8
Solving for X, we get:
X = 13
Therefore, Bobby had 13 pieces of candy at first."
Response: 19 - 2 = 17. Bobby has 17 pieces of candy left after eating 2 pieces.
"Response: 12 (pieces of candy)

Explanation: If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some, then he must have eaten 12 pieces because 32 minus 12 is equal to 20."
"Response: 36 - 17 = 19. 
Explanation: If Bobby had 36 pieces of candy and he ate 17, then he has 36 - 17 = 19 pieces left."

Response: 6 + 5 = 11 globos.
"Response:  Let's use ""A"" to represent the number of globos that Allan had before going to the park and ""J"" to represent the number of globos that Jake had before going to the park. We know that Allan had 3 globos (A = 3) and Jake had 5 globos (J = 5). After they went to the park, Allan bought 2 more globos (Allan now has A + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 globos), so Allan now has 5 globos in total. Jake still has 5 globos. Therefore, the final numbers of globos for each person are:

Allan: 5
Jake: 5"
Response: 3 more globos did Allan have than Jake in the park.
"Response: 4 more globos.
Explanation: When they arrived at the park, Allan had 2 globos and Jake had 6 globos, so Jake had 4 more globos than Allan (6 - 2 = 4). After buying 3 more balloons in the park, Allan now has 5 globos (2 + 3 = 5), but Jake still has 6 globos, so Jake still has 4 more globos than Allan (6 - 5 = 4)."
Response: 8 (5 + 3)
"Response: 4 more globos.
Explanation: When they arrived at the park, Allan had 6 globos and Jake had 2 globos. So, Allan had 6 - 2 = 4 more globos than Jake. After Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park, he had 2 + 3 = 5 globos in total. Therefore, Allan still had 4 more globos than Jake in the park."
Response: 7 (Jake had 7 more balloons than Allan in the park).
Response: 9 (6 + 3)
"Response: 
Allan had 3 globos and 20 pelots (3 x 20 = 60) in the park.

Response: 4 bolsas (the number of additional bags found the next day) minus 1 bag (the bag she had on Monday) equals 3 bags that Tiffany had on Monday.
"Response: 
Tiffany had 10 bags of cans to start with (on Monday).
On Tuesday, she found 3 more bags of cans, so now she has:
10 + 3 = 13 bags of cans.
On Wednesday, she found 7 more bags of cans, so now she has:
13 + 7 = 20 bags of cans in total."
Response: 22 bags (8 + 10 + 4 = 22)
Response: 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans.
Response:  There are 3 more red duraznos than green duraznos in the basket.  
Response: 6 more green apples than red apples (11 - 5 = 6).
Response:  There are 5 green duraznos in the basket because there are 10 red ones and some green ones too.
Response:  There are 10 more green duraznos than red ones in the basket, so there are 10 x 2 = 20 green duraznos in total.
Response: 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 duraznos en la canasta.
Response: 8 - 7 = 1 more green than red in the basket.
Response: 14 - 6 = 8. There are 8 more green duraznos than yellow duraznos in the basket.
Response:  There are 19 red duraznos - 11 yellow duraznos = 8 more red duraznos than yellow duraznos in the basket.
Response: 6 + 16 = 22 duraznos rojos y verdes en la canasta.
"Response: 
There are 18 red duraznos and 14 yellow duraznos in the basket, for a total of 32 fruits."
Response: 6 + 14 = 20. There are 20 duraznos in the basket (6 green and 14 yellow).
Response: 65 x (7 + 3) = 65 x 10 = 650 duraznos en cada cesta.
"Response: 
There are 11 cests x (10 red + 18 green) = 11 x 28 = 318 duraznos in total."

There are 2 rojos, so there are 66 - 2 = 64 duraznos left to compare with the number of verdes.
Since there are 6 verdes and 64 - 6 = 58 amarillos left, there are more amarillos than verdes in the canasta."
Response: 4 (Jerry added 4 figures of action to his shelf.)
Response: 3 figures of action were initially in Jerry's repisa.
Response: 10 (4 + 6)
Response: 7 (figuras de acción) + 9 (libros) = 16.
"Response: 
Let's say there were x books and y action figures in Jerry's bookshelf initially. We know that Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books initially. So we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 2 = 10... (1)

Now, Jerry added 4 more action figures to his bookshelf. So, the total number of action figures now is:

y + 4 =?... (2)

We want to find out how many more books than action figures there are in Jerry's bookshelf after he added the new action figures. To do this, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the total number of items on the bookshelf:

Total Items - Action Figures = Books

Substituting equations (1) and (2), we get:

x + 2 + 4 = Total Items

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, there were 8 books and 10 action figures in Jerry's bookshelf initially. After adding 4 more action figures, there were:

8 + 4 = 12 books and 10 + 4 = 14 action figures in Jerry's bookshelf.

Therefore, there were 12 books and 14 action figures in Jerry's bookshelf after he added the new action figures."
Response: 9 + 10 = 19 books in Jerry's bookshelf.
"Response: 7 (figuras de acción) + 2 (libros) = 9.
Therefore, there were 9 items in total on Jerry's shelf: 7 action figures and 2 books."
Response: 9 more books than action figures.
Response: 12 (8 + 4 - 5)
Response: 3 (Jerry removed 3 figures of action from the shelf.)
Response: 3 figures of action were added to the shelf by Jerry.  
"Response: 
Let x be the number of action figures that Jerry had initially in his room. Then we know that he added 2 more and removed 7, so we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows:
x + 2 - 7 = 10
Simplifying the equation by adding 7 to both sides gives us:
x + 9 = 10
Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
x = 1
Therefore, Jerry had one action figure initially in his room."
Response: 7 (figuras de acción) + 9 (libros) = 16.
Response: 6 (figuras de acción) + 3 (libros) = 9.
"Response: 7 (books) + 3 (figures of action) = 10 items in total.
After adding 2 more figures of action, there would be a total of 10 + 2 = 12 items in the shelf. So, there are 5 books and 7 figures of action in the shelf."
Response: 3 pájaros más vinieron a sentarse en la cerca.
Response: 3 pájaros estaban sentados en la cerca al principio.
Response:  There are 4 + 6 = 10 pájaros sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 + 5 = 8 pájaros and 2 cigüeñas sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 + 2 = 5 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 2 + 3 = 5 pájaros and 6 cigüeñas sitting on the fence.
Response: 8 cigüeñas están sentadas en la cerca (4 + 2 = 8).
Response:  There are 3 + 6 = 9 pájaros (birds) and 4 + 6 = 10 cigüeñas (storks) sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 2 more storks (cigüeñas) sitting on the fence than there are sparrows (pájaros). So, if there are 6 sparrows and 3 storks initially, then there will be 6 + 2 = 8 sparrows and 3 + 2 = 5 storks sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  There are 6 more storks than birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 6 + 4 = 10 storks and 4 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 10 pájaros sitting on the fence (6 + 4).
Response:  There are 4 more storks sitting on the fence than there are birds in total. So if there were 2 birds (pigeons) to start with, then there would be 2 + 4 = 6 storks sitting on the fence.
Response: 8 (2 + 6) cigüeñas más están sentadas en la cerca.
Response:  There are 5 cigüeñas and 3 birds already sitting on the fence. If 4 more birds came to join them, then there would be a total of 5 + 3 = 8 birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 8 - 3 = 5 more birds than cigüeñas sitting on the fence.
Response: 6 cigüeñas + 2 pájaros = 8. 3 more birds came to join them, so there are 8 + 3 = 11 animals in total sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 more storks than birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 6 + 2 = 8 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence.

"Response: 33 pages (calculation below)

Question: A book has two chapters. The first chapter has 60 pages. If there are a total of 93 pages in the book, how many pages does the second chapter have?

Formula to solve for the number of pages in the second chapter:
Total pages - First chapter pages = Second chapter pages
93 - 60 = 33

Therefore, the second chapter has 33 pages."
"Response: 31 pages (calculation below)

Explanation:
To find out how many pages the first chapter has, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the book. In this case, we have:

Total pages = 67 pages
Number of pages in second chapter = 36 pages

So, the number of pages in the first chapter is:

First chapter pages = Total pages - Number of pages in second chapter
= 67 - 36
= 31 pages"

"Response: 
Let's say that Doug had x canicas before he lost some of them in the park. After losing some canicas, Doug has y canicas now. We know that Ed has 19 more canicas than Doug, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

Ed has 19 more canicas than Doug:

Ed = Doug + 19

We also know that Doug had x canicas before he lost any:

Doug = x

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you use these equations to find out how many canicas Doug lost?"
Response: 34 (Ed had 34 more canicas than Doug at that moment).
Response: 15 (Doug has 15 canicas now).
"Response: 
Doug had 24 canicas initially (27 - 3 = 24)."
Response: 24 + (9 - 27) = 24 + (-18) = 24 - 18 = 6 more than Doug had at that moment.

Question: If Sally had $48 in her piggy bank and she spent $15 on a toy, how much money does Sally have left now? 
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: $33."
"Response: 
Ed had 19 more canicas than Doug to start with. This means that Ed had 19 + 0 = 19 canicas in total.
After losing some of his canicas in the park, Ed now has 8 more canicas than Doug. This means that Ed's current number of canicas is 19 - x, where x is the number of canicas lost, and Doug has 8 + 0 = 8 canicas.
We know that Ed had 19 canicas at first, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
19 - x = 8 + 0
Subtracting x from both sides gives us:
19 - x = 8
Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add x to both sides of the equation:
x = 19 - 8
Simplifying, we get:
x = 11
So Ed lost 11 canicas in the park."
Response: 70 (Ed had 70 more canicas than Doug).
Response: 17 - 20 = 3. Therefore, Doug has 3 canicas now.

Response: 732 + 682 = 1414 (niñas)
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that there are currently 135 girls in the school (girls = 135) and 214 boys (boys = 214). We also know that 496 more girls joined the school (more girls = 496) and 910 more boys joined the school (more boys = 910). Our goal is to find out how many students are now in the school.
To solve this problem, we can add the number of girls and boys together to get the total number of students before adding the new students. So, our first step will be to calculate the total number of students before adding the new students:
Total Students = Girls + Boys
= 135 + 214
= 359
Now, let's add the new students to the total number of students:
New Total Students = Total Students + More Girls + More Boys
= 359 + 496 + 910
= 1765
Therefore, there are now 1765 students in the school."
Response: 308 + 318 = 626 students in the school.

"Response: 
Zachary did 44 flexions in class today. David did 58 more than Zachary. Together they did 44 + 58 = 102 flexions."
Response: 7 (Zachary did 7 more flexions than David).
Response: 35 (Zachary did 35 flexions)
"Response: 
David made 51 bends in today's gym class. David made 49 more than Zachary. So, together they did:  
51 + 49 = 100 flexions."
"Response: 
David made 19 more flexions than Zachary, so David did 59 + 19 = 78 flexions."
"Response: 
David did 29 more flexions than Zachary, so he did 44 + 29 = 73 flexions in total. Since he did 13 fewer abdominals than Zachary, David did 73 - 13 = 60 abdominals."
Response: 53 + 14 = 67 (flexiones) and 14 (abdominales).
"Response: 35 + 3 = 38 (Zachary's total number of flexions and abdominals)
David made 58 more flexions than Zachary, so:
58 = 38 + x (where x is the difference between their abdominal counts)
x = 20 (since 20 is the difference between 58 and 38)
Therefore, Zachary did 20 more abdominals than David."
Response: 14 (Zachary did more abdominals than flexions by 14)
"Response: 
David made 39 more flexions than Zachary, so we can set up an equation as follows:

Let D be the number of flexions made by David.
Then, Z is the number of flexions made by Zachary.
We know that David made 39 more flexions than Zachary, so we can write:
D = Z + 39

We also know that John made 13 fewer flexions than David, so we can write:
J = D - 13

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (D and J). Can you use these equations to find out how many flexions David made?"
Response: 38 (John made 4 fewer flexions than David, and David made 22 more flexions than Zachary, so John made 38 flexions in total).
Response: 64 (Zachary made 15 flexions and David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 54 flexions (15 + 39). John did 9 less than David, so he did 45 flexions (54 - 9). Therefore, Zachary did 64 flexions more than John.)

"Response: 49 abdominales (calculation below)

Question: If David did 40 more sit-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer crunches, how many crunches did David do if Zachary did 34 sit-ups and 62 crunches?

Formula: Let D be the number of sit-ups David does. Then we know that D = Z + 40, where Z is the number of sit-ups Zachary does. We also know that D - Z = 17, since David does 17 fewer crunches than Zachary. Solve these two equations simultaneously to find D.

Substituting the given values into the first equation, we get:
D = Z + 40
D = 34 + 40
D = 74

Now substituting the value of D into the second equation, we get:
D - Z = 17
74 - 34 = 17
40 = 17

Therefore, David did 49 crunches."
Response: 25 (flexiones) + 5 (abdominales) = 30.
Response: 10 (Zachary did 10 more abdominal exercises than flexion exercises)

"Response: 
Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. To find out how many more pages she had to do in math compared to reading, we can subtract the number of pages she did for reading from the total number of pages she had to do for both subjects.

Math: 9 + x = 96 (where x is the number of pages she has to do for reading)

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

9 + x - 2 = 96 - 2

Simplifying:

x = 94

So Rachel had to complete 94 more pages of math homework than reading comprehension."

Response:  The rana (frog) jumped 36 + 17 = 53 inches.
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know and how to use it to solve the problem. We know that the langosta (lobster) jumped 25 inches, and the rana (frog) jumped 18 inches more than the langosta. Additionally, we know that the mouse jumped 2 inches more than the frog. So, let's start by adding the jumps of the first three animals:

Langosta (lobster): 25 inches
Rana (frog): 18 inches + 25 inches = 43 inches
Mouse: 2 inches + 43 inches = 45 inches

Therefore, the distance the mouse jumped is 45 inches."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:

* The langosta (lobster) jumped 19 inches.
* The rana (frog) jumped 10 inches more than the langosta, so it jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
* The ratón (mouse) jumped 20 inches more than the rana, so it jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.

Therefore, the ratón jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches more than the langosta."
"Response:  To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to use the information that the crab jumped 19 inches and the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. Let's start by finding out how far the mouse jumped:

Mouse jumped = Frog jumped - 94 inches

We know that the frog jumped 39 inches more than the crab, so we can write an equation based on this information:

Frog jumped = Crab jumped + 39 inches

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (the frog's jump and the mouse's jump). We can solve for the frog's jump by substituting the value of the crab's jump into the first equation:

Frog jumped = Crab jumped + 39 inches
Frog jumped = 19 inches + 39 inches
Frog jumped = 58 inches

Now we can substitute the value of the frog's jump into the second equation to solve for the mouse's jump:

Mouse jumped = Frog jumped - 94 inches
Mouse jumped = 58 inches - 94 inches
Mouse jumped = 36 inches

So the frog jumped 58 inches and the mouse jumped 36 inches."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and how to use it to find our answer. We know that the langosta (lobster) jumped 25 inches, and the rana (frog) jumped 32 inches more than the langosta. Additionally, we know that the mouse (ratón) jumped 26 inches less than the rana. So let's start by finding out how far the rana jumped:

Rana jumped = Langosta jumped + (Rana jumped - Mouse jumped)
= 25 inches + (32 inches - 26 inches)
= 25 inches + 6 inches
= 31 inches

Now we know that the rana jumped 31 inches. Since the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the rana, we can find out how far the mouse jumped by subtracting 26 inches from the distance the rana jumped:

Mouse jumped = Rana jumped - Mouse jumped
= 31 inches - 26 inches
= 5 inches

So the mouse jumped 5 inches."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and how to use that information to find our answer. We know that the ratón (mouse) jumped 5 inches less than the rana (frog). So if the rana jumped x inches, then the ratón jumped x - 5 inches. 
We also know that the langosta (lobster) jumped 24 inches. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x = 24 + (x - 5) 
Where ""x"" represents the distance the rana jumped. To solve for ""x"", we can first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:  
x = 24 + x - 10 
Now we can simplify the left side of the equation:  
x = 34 
So the rana jumped 34 inches. Now we need to find out how much more the rana jumped compared to the langosta. To do this, we can subtract the distance the langosta jumped from the distance the rana jumped:  
Distance rana jumped - Distance langosta jumped =? 
In this case, the distance the rana jumped is 34 inches, and the distance the langosta jumped is 24 inches. So we can calculate the difference as follows:  
34 - 24 = 10 
The rana jumped 10 inches more than the langosta. Therefore, the answer to the question is 10 inches."
"Response: 
The rana jumped 11 inches (2 x 5.5 = 11)."
Response: 40 inches (35 + 4)
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we want to find out. We know that the langusta (lobster) jumped 19 inches, and that the frog jumped 4 inches farther than the rat (mouse). We also know that the rat jumped 44 inches less than the frog. So let's use algebra to solve for the distance the frog jumped.

First, we can write an equation based on what we know:

Langusta (L) = Frog (F) + Rat (R)

where L is the distance the langusta jumped, F is the distance the frog jumped, and R is the distance the rat jumped.

We know that L = 19, so we can substitute this into the first equation:

19 = F + R

Now we need to find out how far the frog jumped. To do this, we can subtract R from both sides of the equation:

19 - R = F

Since we know that R = 44 (the rat jumped 44 inches less than the frog), we can substitute this into the equation:

19 - 44 = F

Solving for F, we get:

F = 53

So the frog jumped 53 inches."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and what we need to find out. We know that the langosta saltó 39 pulgadas (P), the rana saltó P + 19 pulgadas (R), and the ratón saltó P - 12 pulgadas (M). Our goal is to find out how far the ratón saltó (M).

Using the information given in the problem, we can set up an equation based on the distances each animal jumped:

P + R = 39... (1) (since the total distance all three animals jumped is 39 inches)

We also know that the rana jumped 19 inches more than the langosta:

R = P + 19... (2)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

P + (P + 19) = 39

Combine like terms:

2P + 19 = 39

Subtract 19 from both sides:

2P = 10

Divide both sides by 2:

P = 5

Now we can find out how far the ratón saltó:

M = P - 12
= 5 - 12
= -7

So the ratón saltó 7 inches."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know:

* The frog jumped 25 inches more than the mouse.
* The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog.
* The lobster jumped 21 inches.

We can set up an equation based on these facts:

Frog (F) = Mouse (M) + (F - M)

where F is the distance the frog jumped and M is the distance the mouse jumped.

Substituting the values given in the problem:

F = 25 + (25 - 16)
= 25 + 9
= 34 inches

So, the frog jumped 34 inches and the mouse jumped 16 inches less, for a total of:

Mouse = F - M
= 34 - 16
= 18 inches

Therefore, the lobster jumped 34 inches and the mouse jumped 18 inches. The difference between their jumps is:

Lobster - Mouse
= 34 - 18
= 16 inches"
Response: 22 pulgadas (39 - 17 = 22)
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know and what we need to find out. We know that the crab (langosta) jumped 9 inches, and the mouse (ratón) jumped some amount less than the frog (rana), who jumped 33 inches more than the crab. So we can set up an equation based on these facts:

Ratón = Rana - Cangrejo + 33

where Ratón is the distance the mouse jumped, Rana is the distance the frog jumped, and Cangrejo is the distance the crab jumped.

We are asked for the distance the mouse jumped, so we can solve for Ratón:

Ratón = 33 + Cangrejo - Rana

Substituting the values given in the problem:

Ratón = 33 + 9 - 33

Simplifying:

Ratón = 42

So the mouse jumped 42 inches."
"Response:  Let's start by identifying what we know and how to use it to find our answer. We know that the frog jumped x inches more than the crab, where x is the number of inches the frog jumped. We also know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 16 inches. Finally, we know that the crab jumped 14 inches. So, we can set up an equation based on these facts:

Frog (x) = Mouse (x-16) + Crab (14)

Now, let's solve for x. First, we can substitute the value of the mouse into the equation:

Frog (x) = Mouse (x-16) + Crab (14)
= Rat (x-16) + Cra (14)

Next, we can simplify the left side of the equation:

Frog (x) = Rat (x-16) + Cra (14)
= Rat x - 16 + Cra 14
= Rat x - 28 + Cra 14

Finally, we can solve for x by adding both sides of the equation:

Rat x - 28 + Cra 14 = Frog x

Solving for x gives us:

x = 30

So, the frog jumped 30 inches more than the crab. The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 14 inches (since the frog jumped 30 inches). Therefore, the mouse jumped 14 inches more than the crab."

Response: 37 books (115 - 78 = 37)
Response: 230 (the total number of books) - 137 (books sold at the garage sale) = 93 (number of books left after the garage sale).

Response: 151 - 50 = 101 books were purchased by Paul.
Response: 2 (Paul had 2 books before selling some at the garage sale and now he has 58 books after buying new ones.)
Response: 37 books (21 - 15 = 37).
Response: 45 books (116 - 71 = 45).
Response: 42 books were sold in the garage sale.
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Paul had 51 books and 106 pens (bolígrafos).
* After selling some books and pens at a garage sale, he was left with 82 books and 14 pens.

We can start by writing an equation to represent the situation:

Let B be the number of books Paul had before the garage sale.
Let P be the number of pens (bolígrafos) he had before the garage sale.
Let b be the number of books he sold at the garage sale.
Let p be the number of pens he sold at the garage sale.

Now we can write equations based on the information given:

Equation 1: B + P = 51 (Paul had 51 books and pens before the garage sale)
Equation 2: b + p = P (books and pens sold at the garage sale)

Now we need to find out how many pens were sold at the garage sale. We know that Paul had 106 pens before the garage sale, so if he sold all of them, he would have none left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Equation 3: p + b = 106 (all pens were sold at the garage sale)

Now we can solve for p using Equations 2 and 3:

Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 3:
p + b = 106
b + p = P

Solving for p:
p = 106 - b

Now we can substitute the value of b from Equation 2 into the above equation:
p = 106 - b
p = 106 - (82)
p = 24

Therefore, Paul sold 24 pens at the garage sale."
Response: 136 - 27 = 109 books were sold by Paul in his garage sale.
Response: 66 books (68 - 2 = 66)
"Response: 
Let X be the number of books sold in the garage sale. Then we can write an equation based on the information given:

95 - X = 13 (since Paul has 13 books left after the sale)

We know that each book costs $5, so the total amount earned from selling books is:

X \* 5 = 95 - X

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2X = 82

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

X = 41

Therefore, Paul sold 41 books in the garage sale."

"Response: 
Let x be the number of roses that Jessica cut from her garden. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem as follows:

x + 14 = 13 + x (since there were originally 13 roses and now there are 14)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

Therefore, Jessica cut 7 roses from her garden."

Danny found 32 more bottle caps in the park."
Response: 51 + 33 = 84 tapas de botellas.
Response: 11 (36 - 35 = 11)
Response: 63 - 30 = 33. Therefore, Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than he found in the park.
"Response: 
Let's use ""T"" to represent the number of tapas de botellas that Danny had at first. We know that he found 22 more tapas in the park, so we can write an equation as follows:

28 = T + 22

Solving for T, we get:

T = 28 - 22
T = 6

So, Danny had 6 tapas de botellas at first."
"Response: 
Let's use ""T"" to represent the number of envoltorios that Danny had at first.
We know that he found 22 tapas de botellas and 30 envoltorios in the park.
So, we can write an equation based on this information:
T + 22 = 57 (since he has 57 envoltorios now)
Solving for T, we get:
T = 35
Therefore, Danny had 35 envoltorios at the beginning."
"Response: 
Danny found 30 tapas de botellas in the park and 14 envoltorios. If he now has 7 tapas de botellas and 86 envoltorios, then he found 23 more envoltorios than tapas de botellas (86 - 7 = 23)."
Response: 51 - 11 = 40 (Danny found 40 more envelopes than bottle caps in the park).
"Response: 
Danny has 28 tapas de botellas and 16 envoltorios in his collection now. To find out how many more tapas he has than envoltorios, we can subtract the number of envoltorios from the number of tapas:

28 - 16 = 12

So, Danny has 12 more tapas de botellas than envoltorios."
"Response: 43 - 27 = 16. 
Danny has 16 more envelopes than bottle caps in his collection now."
Response: 91 (66 + 25)
Response: 7 (tapas de botella)
Response: 60 + 58 = 118. Therefore, Danny had 118 tapas de botellas at the beginning.
Response: 50 - 6 = 44. Danny found 44 more tapas of bottles in the park than he threw away.
Response: 6 (54 - 48 = 6)
"Response: 
Let's use ""T"" to represent the number of tapas de botellas that Danny had at first. Since he found 29 tapas in the park, we can set up an equation as follows:

T + 29 = 42... (1)

We also know that he collected 82 envoltorios, so we can write another equation:

T + 82 = 61... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving equation (1) for T, we get:

T = 42 - 29
T = 13

Substituting this value into equation (2), we get:

13 + 82 = 61

Solving for the missing variable, we find that:

95 = 61

Therefore, Danny had 13 tapas de botellas at the beginning."
"Response: 
Let's use ""D"" to represent the number of envoltorios that Danny had at first.
We know that he found 66 envoltorios in the park, so we can write an equation based on this information:

66 = D + 16 (since he has 16 envoltorios now)

Solving for D, we get:

D = 50

So, Danny had 50 envoltorios at the beginning."

Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: 4 + 6 = 10 horas (time it would take for both Sally and John to paint the room together)."
Response: 24 (31 - 9 = 24)
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Danny has 11 envoltorios (E)
* Danny has 12 tapas de botellas (T)

We can write this as an equation:

E + T =?

Now we need to find out how many more tapas de botellas Danny has than envoltorios. To do this, we subtract the number of envoltorios from the number of tapas de botellas:

T - E =?

Solving for the unknown variable (T), we get:

T - E = 12 - 11 = 1

So Danny has 1 more tapa de botella than envoltorio.

Therefore, the answer is:

Danny has 1 more tapa de botella than envoltorio."
Response: 67 - 35 = 32. Therefore, Danny has 32 more envoltorios than tapas de botellas.
Response: 17 + 11 = 28. Therefore, Steven has 28 duraznos.
"Response: 7 + (14 - 15) = 7 + (-1) = 6. 
Therefore, Jake has 6 duraznos."
Response: 20 - 19 = 1. So Jill has 1 durazno.
"Response: 
Jake has 3 fewer melons than Steven, who has 8 more melons than Jill. So, we can start by finding out how many melons Steven has:
Steven has 8 + 3 = 11 melons.
Now, we know that Jill has 11 - 8 = 3 melons.
So, Jake has 3 fewer melons than Jill, which means he has 3 - 3 = 0 melons.
Therefore, Jake has no melons, and Jill has 3 melons."
Response: 7 (Jill has 7 more duraznos than Jake).
"Response: 
Jake has 7 fewer duraznos than Steven and 9 more duraznos than Jill. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let S be the number of duraznos that Steven has (which is given as 16):

Jake has 7 fewer duraznos than Steven, so Jake's duraznos are:

J = S - 7... (1)

Jill has 9 more duraznos than Jake, so Jill's duraznos are:

Jill = J + 9... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (J and Jill). Solving for J first using equation (1), we get:

J = S - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

So Jake has 9 duraznos. Now substituting J into equation (2), we get:

Jill = 9 + 9
= 18

Therefore, Jill has 18 duraznos."
"Response: 
Jake has 7 fewer duraznos than Steven and 8 more duraznos than Jill. So, if Steven has 17 duraznos, then Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 duraznos. And Jill has 10 + 8 = 18 duraznos. Therefore, Jill has 18 duraznos."
"Response: 
Steven has 16 + (18 - 9) = 16 + 9 = 25 duraznos more than Jill."
Response: 23.
Response: 39 more than Jill.
Response: 37 (15 + 12 = 37)
"Response: 
Jake has 12 fewer duraznos than Steven and 79 more manzanas. To find out how many duraznos Jake has, we can subtract 12 from the number of duraznos that Steven has. If Steven has 19 duraznos, then Jake has:

19 - 12 = 7

So Jake has 7 duraznos."
"Response: 
Jake has 13 fewer duraznos than Steven and 3 more manzanas. To find out how many manzanas Jake has, we can subtract 13 from the number of duraznos that Steven has and then add 3 to get the total number of manzanas.
Let's start with the information given in the problem:
Steven has 9 duraznos.
So, if Jake has 13 fewer duraznos, Jake has:
9 - 13 =?
Now, let's add 3 to the result:
9 - 13 + 3 =?
Simplifying:
6 + 3 =?
Solving for the unknown quantity (the number of manzanas):
9 + 3 = 12
Therefore, Jake has 12 manzanas."
"Response: 
Steven has 17 - 6 = 11 duraznos more than Jake.
Since Jake has 8 more manzanas than duraznos, Steven has 16 + 8 = 24 manzanas.
Therefore, Steven has 11 duraznos more than manzanas."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know:
Jake has 3 fewer melocotones than Steven and 10 more apples. So, if Steven has x melocotones, Jake has x - 3 melocotones.
Steven has 12 melocotones, so we can set up an equation based on that information:
x = 12... (1)
Now, let's look at the number of apples each person has:
Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so Jake has x + 10 apples.
We know that Steven has 15 apples, so we can set up another equation based on that information:
x + 10 = 15... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and Jake's number of apples). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x. Let's use substitution. Solving equation (1) for x gives us:
x = 12
Substituting this into equation (2), we get:
12 + 10 = 15
Solving for Jake's number of apples, we get:
Jake has 22 apples.
So, Steven has 12 melocotones and 15 apples, while Jake has 22 apples and 9 melocotones (since he has 3 fewer melocotones than Steven).
Therefore, the difference between Steven's number of melocotones and Jake's number of melocotones is:
12 - 9 = 3
Steven has 3 more melocotones than Jake."
"Response: 
Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 duraznos."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

Steven has 18 duraznos (S).
Jake has 12 duraznos less than Steven (J = S - 12).
Jill has 8 duraznos more than Jake (Jill = J + 8).

Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equation for Jill's duraznos:

Jill = J + 8
Jill = (S - 12) + 8
Jill = S - 4

Since Steven has 18 duraznos, we can plug that value into the equation above to solve for Jill's duraznos:

Jill = 18 - 4
Jill = 14

Therefore, Jill has 14 duraznos."
"Response: 
Jake has 12 fewer duraznos than Steven, so Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 duraznos."
Response: 9 (9 = 14 - 6 + 3)
"Response: 
Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer duraznos (durazns in Spanish). So if Steven has x duraznos and x manzanas, then Jake has x + 84 manzanas and x - 10 duraznos. We know that Steven has 13 duraznos and 52 manzanas, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

x + 84 = Jake's number of manzanas
x - 10 = Jake's number of duraznos

Solving for Jake's number of duraznos, we get:

x - 10 = Jake's number of duraznos
x - 10 = (x + 84) - 10
x - 10 = x + 74

Simplifying, we get:

x = 94

So Jake has 94 duraznos."
"Response: 
Jake has 13 more apples than Steven and 17 fewer durians than Steven. So if Steven has x apples and x durians, then Jake has x + 13 apples and x - 17 durians. We know that Steven has 8 durians and 12 apples, so we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for x.

x + 13 = Jake's apples
x - 17 = Jake's durians

Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 10 (apples)
x = 6 (durians)

So Jake has 10 + 13 = 23 apples and 6 - 17 = 9 durians."
Response: 7 more duraznos than manzanas.
"Response: 
Steven has 19 manzanas (M) and 15 duraznos (D). 
Jake has 3 less duraznos than Steven, so Jake has M - D = 19 - 15 = 4 manzanas fewer than Steven. 
Since Jake has 4 more apples than duraznos, we can write:  
M - D = 4 
Solving for M, we get:  
M = D + 4 
Substituting M = 19, we get:  
19 = 15 + 4 
Simplifying, we get:  
19 = 19 
Therefore, Steven has 19 manzanas and 15 duraznos."
Response: 63 dollars (78 - 15 = 63).
"Response: 
Olivia had $109 ($78 + $33)."
"Response: 

To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she had before going to the supermarket (159 - 100 =) from the total amount of money she had after getting it from the ATM and before going to the supermarket (148 + 100 =). This gives us:

159 - 100 = 59

So Olivia spent $59 at the supermarket."
Response: 49 - x = 49, where x is the amount spent at the supermarket. Solving for x gives us x = 10. So Olivia spent $10 at the supermarket and received an additional $49 from the ATM, for a total of $59.
Response: 77 dollars ($91 - $14 = $77).
"Response: 

To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she had left after visiting the exhibition ($26) from the total amount of money she had before going to both places ($106). This gives us:

$106 - $26 = $80

So, Olivia spent $80 at the supermarket."
"Response: 
Olivia had $54 to spend and she spent $x dollars at the supermarket.
After spending the money, she had $29 left.
We can set up an equation based on this information:
Let's say x is the amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket.
Then we know that Olivia had $54 - x dollars left after shopping.
The problem states that she has $29 left, so we can set up the following equation:
$54 - x = $29
To solve for x, we can add $x to both sides of the equation:
$54 + x = $29 + x
Now we have:
$63 = $30
Subtracting $30 from both sides gives us:
$33 = $30
Which means that Olivia spent $33 at the supermarket."

We know that initially, Dave had A = 17 applications and F = 21 files. After removing some applications and files, he was left with A = 3 applications and F = 7 files.

Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

A - 17 + 3 = 0... (1)
F - 21 + 7 = 0... (2)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

A = 3... (solved from Equation 1)

To find out how many bags of oranges they will have after 49 days of harvesting, we need to calculate how many bags they can harvest in 49 days. We know that they harvest 38 bags per day and each bag contains 42 oranges. So, to find out how many bags they will have after 49 days, we multiply 38 by 49:

38 x 49 = 1794

So, after 49 days of harvesting, they will have 1794 bags of oranges."
"Response: 
To find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they will harvest in 87 days. We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows:

Total number of oranges = Number of sacks x Number of oranges per sack
= 66 x 25
= 1650

Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, they will have 1650 x 87 = 143,950 oranges."

To find out how many bags of oranges they will have after 26 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of bags of oranges they will harvest in 26 days. We know that they harvest 28 bags of mature oranges and 52 bags of green oranges per day. So, if we multiply 28 by 26, we get 744 bags of mature oranges, and if we multiply 52 by 26, we get 1344 bags of green oranges. Therefore, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have a total of 744 + 1344 = 2088 bags of oranges."

To find out how many bags of mature oranges they will have after 73 days of harvesting, we need to calculate how many bags of green oranges they will harvest in 73 days and then subtract that number from the total number of bags of mature oranges they will produce in that time period.

Let's start by calculating how many bags of green oranges they will harvest in 73 days:

73 days x 25 bags/day = 1825 bags of green oranges

Now, let's subtract the number of bags of green oranges from the total number of bags of mature oranges they will produce in 73 days:

1825 bags - 5 bags/day = 1820 bags of mature oranges

Therefore, after 73 days of harvesting, they will have 1820 bags of mature oranges."
"Response: 
To find out how many bags of green oranges there will be after 6 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of bags of green oranges that are produced each day and then multiply it by 6.

Let X = number of camisetas sold during the Texas Tech game.
We know that the Razorbacks sold 172 camisetas during the Arkansas game, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

X + 172 = 186 (total number of camisetas sold)

Now, we need to find out how much money was made from selling camisetas during the Texas Tech game. We are given that each camiseta costs $78, so we can multiply the number of camisetas sold by the price per camiseta:

Money Made = X x $78

Substituting X with the value we found earlier, we get:

Money Made = X x $78

Si Lewis gana $460 en 5 semanas, entonces gana $92 por semana ($460 / 5 semanas)."
Response: 75 weeks (or approximately 18 months).
"Response: 

To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the season, we need to subtract the amount he pays in taxes from his total earnings. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Total earnings per week: $21
* Number of weeks in the season: 216
* Amount paid in taxes: $702

We can calculate Lewis's total earnings for the season by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the season:

Total earnings = $21 x 216 = $4592

Now, let's subtract the amount Lewis pays in taxes from his total earnings:

$4592 - $702 = $3890

Therefore, Lewis will have $3890 at the end of the season after paying $702 in taxes."
"Response: 
If Si Lewis earns $1357 per week during 223 weeks of a harvest season and works for 73 such seasons, then he will have earned a total amount of:  
$$ \text{Total Amount} = 1357 \times 223 + 1357 \times 73 $$
Simplifying the expression:
$$ \text{Total Amount} = 309,841 + 96,319 $$
Therefore, Si Lewis will have earned a total amount of $406,160 if he works for 73 harvest seasons."
"Response: 
Lewis earns $28 per week for 1091 weeks (season of harvest) = $28 x 1091 = $31,568.
He also earns $939 per week for working extra hours every week = $939 x 1091 = $1,047,599.
Therefore, Lewis's total income during the season of harvest is $1,047,599 + $31,568 = $1,079,167."
"Response: 
Lewis earns $403 per week during the 233 weeks of the harvest season. If he pays $49 per week in rent, his total income for the season is:

$403 x 233 = $91,590

Therefore, Lewis earns $91,590 during the harvest season, after paying $49 per week in rent."
"Response: 
Lewis pays $388 per week in rent during the season of harvest, which lasts for 1359 weeks. Therefore, he pays a total of:

$388 x 1359 = $507,422 as rent during the season of harvest."
"Response: 
To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the season, we need to subtract his weekly expenses from his weekly income. We can do this by subtracting $216 from $491, which gives us:

$491 - $216 = $275

So, Lewis will have $275 at the end of the season."

To find out how many cookies each person got, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of friends. In this case, we have 22 + 34 = 56 cookies in total and 11 friends. So, each friend will get:

56 / 11 = 5

Each person will get 5 cookies."
Response: 10 pasteles each (30 / 3 = 10).
"Response: 
To find out how many cookies and cakes each person got, we need to divide the total number of cookies and cakes by the number of friends. Let's do this for both cookies and cakes separately.
For cookies:
Total cookies = 14 (Matthew had)
Number of friends = 7
Each friend gets = Total cookies / Number of friends
= 14 / 7
= 2
So each friend gets 2 cookies.
For cakes:
Total cakes = 21 (Matthew had)
Number of friends = 7
Each friend gets = Total cakes / Number of friends
= 21 / 7
= 3
So each friend gets 3 cakes."
"Response: 36 / 18 = 2.
Each person got 2 cookies."
Response: 6 x 4 = 24. Therefore, Matthew gave 24 galletas to his friends.
"Response: 
Let's say that each friend received x galletas. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:

x + x + x = 11 (since there are 11 galletas left after giving some to the friends)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4 (Since 4 x 3 = 12 and 12 - 11 = 1)

So each friend received 4 galletas."
Response: 8 (Matthew gave 8 galletas to each of his 5 friends)
Response: 8 gallets por persona (32 galletas divididas entre 4 personas).
Response: 2 pasteles por persona (2 x 4 = 8).
"Response: 
Let's say there are x people who will eat only gallets and y people who will eat only pastries. Since everyone gets the same amount of both, we can set up two equations based on the information given:
x + y = 28 (total number of friends)
13x + 15y =? (total amount of food available)
We know that the total amount of food available is 13gallets and 15pastries, so we can substitute those values into the second equation:
13x + 15y = 13(13) + 15(15)
13x + 15y = 169 + 225
13x + 15y = 404
Now solve for x and y by dividing both sides by 13 and 15 respectively:
x = 404/13
x = 31
y = 404/15
y = 27
So, if Mateo has 28 friends and gives each one the same amount of gallets and pastries, then each person who eats only gallets will get 31 gallets, and each person who eats only pastries will get 27 pastries."
"Response: 
Debby drank 109 bottles per day x 74 days = 8231 bottles."
Response: 9 botellas por día.
Response: 264 - (15 x 11) = 264 - 165 = 99 botellas.
"Response: 
Debby drank 144 bottles per day for x days if she had 301 bottles and was left with 157 bottles.

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let's say Debby drank x days worth of water.

Debby started with 301 bottles and drank 144 bottles per day.

So, after one day, she would have drunk 144 bottles and would have been left with:

301 - 144 = 157 bottles

Since there are 157 bottles remaining, we know that Debby must have drunk for at least one day. Therefore, our equation becomes:

x + 1 = (number of days)

We know that Debby drank 144 bottles per day, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

x + 1 = 144

Now, we need to solve for ""x"" which represents the number of days Debby drank water. To do this, we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:

x + 1 - 1 = 144 - 1

This simplifies to:

x = 143

Therefore, Debby drank water for 143 days before running out."
"Response: 22 days.
Explanation:
Debby has 88 bottles of water and drinks 4 bottles per day, so she will run out of water in:
88 / 4 = 22 days."

To find out how many days the bottles of soda will last, we need to divide the number of bottles of soda by the number of bottles consumed per day. In this case, there are 4 bottles of soda consumed per day and there are 256 bottles of soda in total, so we can calculate as follows:

256 bottles / 4 bottles/day = 64 days

Therefore, the bottles of soda will last for 64 days if Debby consumes 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day."
Response: 2 days (12 bottles / 6 bottles per day = 2 days)
"Response: 
To find out how many days the water bottles will last, we need to divide the number of water bottles by the number of bottles she drinks per day. So, if she has 180 bottles and drinks 15 per day, then she will have enough water for:

180 / 15 = 12 days

So, her water bottles will last for 12 days."
"Response: 45 days.

Explanation: To determine how many days the bottles of soda will last, we need to divide the number of bottles of soda by the number of bottles consumed per day. In this case, there are 162 bottles of soda and Debby consumes 9 bottles per day, so:

162 / 9 = 18 days

Therefore, the bottles of soda will last for 18 days."

Response: 67 x 66 = 4322 students / 6 seats per bus = 720 buses needed for the trip.
"Response: 43 autobuses.
Explanation: To determine how many autobuses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students (58) by the number of seats in each bus (2). This gives us:
58 / 2 = 29
So, we need 29 buses to transport all the students. Since there are 43 aulas, we can round up to the nearest whole number and say that we need 43 buses for the trip."
"Response: 24 (number of classes) x 30 (average number of students per class) = 720 students in total.  
Since there are only 120 students in the school and each class has an average of 30 students, we can divide 720 by 120 to get the average number of students per class: 720 / 120 = 6. Therefore, there are approximately 6 students in each class."

Explanation: To find out how many days it took Frank to finish reading his book, we can divide the number of pages in the book (392) by the number of pages he reads per day (14):

392 pages / 14 pages/day = 28 days"
"Response: 
The book has 22 x 365 = 7940 pages."
Response: 612 pages / 6 days = 102 pages per day.
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying that we know the total number of pages in the book is 555 and it has 5 chapters. We also know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading the book. To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we can use division. Let's divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:

555 pages / 5 chapters = x pages per chapter

Now we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we can use the information that Frank took 220 days to read the book. We know that there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity), so we can calculate the average number of pages Frank read per day:

220 days / 365 days per year = 0.607 pages per day

Now we can use this value to find out how many pages are in each chapter:

x pages per chapter = 0.607 pages per day x total number of pages

Substituting the values, we get:

x pages per chapter = 0.607 x 555 = 334 pages per chapter

Therefore, there are 334 pages in each chapter of the book."
"Response: 
To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of days it took him to finish the book by the number of chapters in the book. Let's do that:

660 days / 15 chapters = x chapters/day

Now we can solve for x:

x = 660 days / 15 chapters
= 44 days/chapter

So, Frank read approximately 44 chapters per day."
"Response: 87 pages per day (calculation below)

Question: How many pages did Frank read in total?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: 24,760 pages (calculation below)"
"Response: 8 books.
Explanation: To find out how many books Frank read, we need to divide the total number of days he took to finish all the books by the number of days he spent reading each book. In this case, it would be:

492 days / 12 days per book = 41 books

However, since we are asked for an integer answer, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 8 books."
Response: 7 pages per day (112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages/day)
Response: 72 days (8 pages/day x 576 pages = 4608 pages / 365 days per year = 12.67 pages/day)
"Response: 
To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took him to finish reading it. Let's do that:

Total pages = 41 x 450 = 18,950 pages
Days taken = 30

Now, let's calculate the average number of pages Frank read per day:

Average pages/day = Total pages / Days taken
= 18,950 / 30
= 631.67 pages/day

So, Frank read approximately 631.67 pages per day."
"Response: 
To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we need to divide the total number of days it took Frank to read the book by the number of chapters. We can do this using the following equation:

Number of pages per chapter = Total number of days / Number of chapters

We know that Frank spent 607 days reading the book and there are three chapters. So, we can plug these values into the equation like this:

Number of pages per chapter = 607 / 3

Solving for the number of pages per chapter, we get:

Number of pages per chapter = 202

Therefore, there are 202 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book."
"Response: 1 chapter per day.

Explanation: To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of days it took him to finish the book by the number of pages in each chapter. In this case, we have:

Response: 45 visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham that day.
"Response: 24,630 visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham in 57 days.

Explanation:
To find out how many visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham in 57 days, we need to first calculate the total number of visitors who came on the two days that Rachel and her family were there. We know that 188 visitors came on the previous day, and 557 visitors came on the day when Rachel's family went to see the palace. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the two days is:

188 + 557 = 745

Now, we can divide this total by the number of days they were there (57) to get the average daily attendance:

745 / 57 = 13.09

So, approximately 13,090 visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham during the 57-day period."
Response: 661 - 600 = 61. There were 61 more visitors to the Palace of Buckingham that day than there were the previous day.
"Response: 

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The day before yesterday (day -2), there were 419 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham.
* Yesterday (day -1), there were 103 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham.
* Today (day 0), there were 92 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham.

We want to find out how many visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham before today. To do this, we need to subtract the number of visitors from each previous day from the total number of visitors for that day. Let's call the total number of visitors for each day ""x"".

Day -2 (before yesterday):
x - 419 =?

Since there were 419 visitors, we can set up the equation as follows:

x - 419 =?

Solving for x, we get:

x = 638

So, there were 638 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day before yesterday.

Day -1 (yesterday):
x - 103 =?

Again, we can set up the equation as follows:

x - 103 =?

Solving for x, we get:

x = 741

So, there were 741 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham yesterday.

Now, let's find out how many visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham before today:

x - 92 =?

Setting up the equation again:

x - 92 =?

Solving for x, we get:

x = 853

Therefore, there were 853 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham before today."
"Response: 
To find out how many people visited the Palace of Buckingham in the last 89 days, we need to add up all the visitors from each day. We can start with the number of visitors on the day before yesterday (808), then add the number of visitors from yesterday (471), and finally add the number of visitors today (512). Therefore, the total number of visitors to the Palace of Buckhampton in the last 89 days is:

808 + 471 + 512 = 1791

So, there were 1791 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in the last 89 days."

Response: 146 g (166 - 20)
Response: 540 g (since 557 - 17 = 540).
"Response:  To determine how many more grams of wax are needed, we need to subtract the amount of wax currently available (11g) from the total amount required by the feathers (492g). Therefore, the difference is:  
492g - 11g = 481g 
So, 481 grams more of wax are needed."

Response: 30 x 78 = 2340 pieces of junk mail to be delivered per house if there are 19 houses in each block.
Response: 16 houses in each block.
Response: 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of junk mail per cuadra (since there are 12 houses in each cuadra and 4 pieces of junk mail to be delivered to each house).
"Response: 
To calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail that the postman must deliver, we need to multiply the number of houses in each block by the number of blocks and then add up all these products. Since there are 17 houses in each block, we can calculate as follows:

Total number of pieces of junk mail = (16 x 17) + (16 x 17) +... + (16 x 17)
= 16 x 17 x 16 + 16 x 17 x 15 +... + 16 x 17 x 3
= 289 + 253 +... + 39
= 289 + 253 + 227 +... + 39
= 1008

Therefore, the postman must deliver 1008 pieces of junk mail in total."
"Response: 
There are 20 canicas in total and Rebecca wants to divide them into groups of 4. Therefore, there will be:

20 / 4 = 5 groups

So, Rebecca can create 5 groups of 4 canicas each."
Response: 3 groups of 5 eggs each will be created since 10 (canicas) divided by 5 (groups) equals 2 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, there will be 3 groups of 5 eggs each and 1 egg left over.
"Response: 
Rebecca has 11 x 4 = 44 eggs in total."
"Response: 
There are 8 huevos in total and we want to divide them into 4 groups. To do this, we will use the divisor 4 to distribute the huevos equally among the groups.

Let's start by dividing 8 by 4:

8 ÷ 4 = 2

This means that each group will have 2 huevos. Therefore, there will be 4 groups with 2 huevos each."
"Response: 
There are 15 eggs in total and Rebecca wants to divide them into 3 groups. To do this, she will use her 4 cups. Since there are more eggs than cups, each group will have some eggs left over. Here's how we can calculate how many eggs each group will have:

Let X be the number of eggs in each group.
Since there are 15 eggs in total, we know that 3X = 15 (since there are 3 groups).
We also know that each group has 4 cups, so we can write:
3X = 4(X) + 0(X) + 0(X) (since the remaining eggs don't fit in any cup)
Simplifying the equation:
3X = 4X
Solving for X:
X = 5
So, each group will have 5 eggs."
Response: 3 groups of 6 eggs each will be created since 18 / 6 = 3 with no remainder.
Response: 99 / 3 = 33 groups of 3 eggs each.
Response: 14 (huevos) - 6 (canicas) = 8. Therefore, Rebecca has 8 more huevos than canicas.
"Response: 
Rebecca has 12 huevos and 5 canicas, so she has 12 - 5 = 7 more huevos than canicas."

Response: 6 manzanas (9 - 3 = 6)
Response: 8 (Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2, so Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie).
Response: 1 (Jackie has one more apple than Adam)
Response: 2 (Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam)
Response: 10 (6 + 4)
Response: 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, [nombre] has 16 manzanas.
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying what we know about the situation:

* Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples.
* Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
* Jackie has 9 fewer apples than Adam.

We can use these clues to find out how many apples each person has. Let's start with Adam:

Adam has 12 - 8 = 4 apples more than Jackie.

Now let's find out how many apples Jackie has:

Jackie has 12 - 9 = 3 apples less than Adam.

So, Adam has 4 apples more than Jackie, which means Jackie has 3 apples less than Adam. Therefore, Adam has 4 + 3 = 7 apples, and Jackie has 3 apples."
"Response: 
Adam has 6 + 10 = 16 manzanas (6 more than Adam and Jackie together)."
"Response: 
Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, so if Jackie has x manzanas (apples), then Adam has x + 5 manzanas.
We know that Jackie has 89 naranjas and 11 manzanas, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 11 = 89... (1)

Now we need to find out how many manzanas Adam has. We know that he has 5 more than Jackie, so we can use equation (1) to find his number of manzanas:

x + 5 =?... (2)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2):

x + 5 = x + 11... (3)

Solving for x in equation (3):

x + 5 = x + 11

x = 10

So, Jackie has 10 manzanas and Adam has 10 + 5 = 15 manzanas."

"Response:  To find out how much money Fred made washing cars, we need to subtract the amount of money he had before from the amount of money he has now:  
115 - 111 = $4 
So, Fred made $4 washing cars."
Response:  To find out how much money Jason made delivering newspapers, we need to subtract the amount of money he had at the beginning from the amount of money he has now. So, if Jason had $3 at the beginning and now has $63, then he made $60 ($63 - $3).
Response:  To find out how much money was made delivering newspapers, we need to subtract the amount of money that Jason had before he delivered papers (31 dollars) from the amount of money he has now after delivering papers (14 dollars). So, Jason made $31 - $14 = $17 delivering newspapers.
Response:  $16 + $74 = $90.
Response:  To find out how much money Fred has now, we need to add his original amount of money ($47) to what he earned from delivering newspapers and washing cars. So, Fred has $47 + $111 = $158.

"Response: 3 tomates and 5 papas (175 - 172 = 3; 77 - 172 = 5)."
"Response: 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes.
Explanation: If the farmer had 177 tomatoes and picked 53 of them, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he had 12 papas (potatoes) and did not pick any, then he still has 12 papas."
"Response: 
Let's use algebra to solve this problem! Let T represent the total number of tomatoes. Since there are 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, we can write:
T = 105 + 71
We know that the farmer collected 137 tomatoes, so we can set up an equation:
137 = T - (105 + 71)
Simplifying the equation:
137 = T - 176
Solving for T:
T = 313
So, there were originally 313 tomatoes in the garden."

Therefore, the total number of nails needed for the wall of the house is:

221 + 120 = 341 nails"
Response: 4 tables are needed for the wall of the house.
"Response: 
To calculate the total number of nails needed for the wall of the house, we need to add the number of nails required for the large boards and the small boards.

For the large boards, there are 12 boards x 15 nails per board = 180 nails.

For the small boards, there are 10 boards x 5 nails per board = 50 nails.

Therefore, the total number of nails needed for the wall of the house is 180 + 50 = 230 nails."
Response: 32 clavos (2 x 16)
"Response: 
To determine how many tables John needs for the wall of his house, we need to divide the total number of nails required by the number of nails needed per table. We can calculate this as follows:

Total number of nails = 8 x 74 = 612

Number of nails per table = 74

Therefore, John needs:

612 / 74 = 8 tables

So John needs 8 tables for the wall of his house."
"Response: 
To determine how many tables John needs for the wall of his house, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for all the large and small tables combined. Then, we can divide that number by the number of nails required per table to find out how many tables he needs.

Let's start with the total number of nails required:

Total nails = (12 x 14) + (17 x 25)
= 168 + 425
= 693

Now, let's divide the total number of nails by the number of nails required per table:

693 / 14 (for large tables)
= 49

693 / 25 (for small tables)
= 27

So, John needs 49 large tables and 27 small tables for the wall of his house."

The machine made 4 x 5 = 20 camisas during the 5 minutes it worked."
"Response: 

Let x be the number of minutes that the machine worked yesterday. Since it made 9 camisas in one day, we can write an equation based on this information:

9 = 3x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3

So, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday."
"Response: 13 + 3 = 16 camisas.
Since each camisa takes 8 minutes to make, we have:
16 x 8 = 128 minutes.
Therefore, the machine worked for 128 minutes in total."
"Response: 4 minutes.

Explanation:
The machine made 9 camisas yesterday and 8 camisas today, so it produced a total of 9 + 8 = 17 camisas in two days.
Since each camisa takes 2 minutes to make, the machine worked for a total of 17 x 2 = 34 minutes.
However, we are only interested in the time the machine spent working today, so we need to subtract the time it spent working yesterday from the total time.
Therefore, the machine worked for 34 - 9 = 25 minutes today."

"Response: 14 dólares por día.
Explanation: To find out how much money the ring toss game made per day, we need to divide the total amount of money it made (420 dollars) by the number of days it was played (30). This gives us:

420 dollars / 30 days = 14 dollars per day."
"Response: 

To find out how much money was made in total, we need to add up the amount of money earned during the first 44 days and the amount of money earned during the last 10 days.

First 44 days: $382
Last 10 days: $374

Total: $382 + $374 = $756"
"Response: 
To find out how much they made per day in the first 20 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total amount earned in those 20 days by the number of days.

Total amount earned in first 20 days = $120
Number of days = 20

So, daily earnings for the first 20 days = Total amount / Number of days
= $120 / 20
= $6 per day

Therefore, they made $6 per day in the first 20 days of the carnival."
"Response: 
To find out how much they raised per day in the remaining 57 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total amount raised during those days by the number of days:

Total amount raised = $325 + $114 = $439
Number of days = 57

So, they raised $439 / 57 = $7.68 per day in the last 57 days of the carnival."
