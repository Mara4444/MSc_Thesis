Explanation:
The statement ""fler fåglar kom att ansluta sig till dem"" means that more birds joined the two birds already sitting on the fence.

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is that there were ""few"" birds on the fence initially and then four more birds came to join them. This implies that there were five birds on the fence at the beginning."
Response: 50 (46 + 6 = 50)
"Response: 9 (5 + 4)

Answer Explanation:
The question states that ""Tre fåglar och två storkar satt på stängslet"" which means three birds and two storks are sitting on the fence. Then it says ""Fem fler fåglar kom för att ansluta sig till dem"", which means five more birds came to join them. Therefore, the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 3 + 5 = 8."
"Response: 6 + 2 = 8

Explanation:
The statement ""Tre fåglar och fyra storkar satt på stengelset"" means that there are three birds and four storks sitting on the fence. When two more birds come to join them, there will be six birds in total (3 + 2). Therefore, the number of birds is equal to the number of storks plus two, which is 8."
"Response: 10

Explanation:
The statement ""Tre fler fåglar kom för att ansluta sig till dem"" means that three more birds came to join them. Since there were initially two birds and six storks, and then three more birds joined them, the total number of birds is now five (2 + 6 + 3 = 5). Therefore, the number of storks sitting on the fence is still six (6). So, the final answer is 10 (5 birds + 6 storks)."
Response: 12 storkor sit on the fence.
Response: 10 (6 + 4).
"Response: 4 + 3 = 7

Explanation:
The question states that there are ""sex"" (6) birds and ""tre"" (3) storks sitting on the fence. Then, it says that ""två fler storkar"" (2 more storks) came to join them, which means that there are now ""fyra"" (4) more storks joining the group of 6 birds and 3 storks already present, for a total of 10 storks and 6 birds. Therefore, the answer is 10 + 6 = 16."

Question:  En hund har fem ungar. Varje ung ha en katt som vaktar dem. How many cats are there in total?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 5 (one cat per each of the five puppies)"
"Response: 16 + 4 = 20

Explanation:
The question states that ""fem fler fåglar"" and ""fyra fler storkar"" came to join the two birds already sitting on the fence. This means that there are five more birds and four more storks than the initial two birds. Therefore, the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is:

Birds: 5 + 2 = 7
Storks: 4 + 2 = 6
So, there are 7 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence."
"Response: 18

Explanation:
The number of birds sitting on the fence is given as ""tre"", which means three in Swedish. The next group of birds that come to join them are described as ""två fler fåglar"", which means two more birds. This brings the total number of birds to five (3 + 2).
Next, we are told that six more storks come to join the birds, so the total number of storks is now 6 + 5 = 11 storks. Since there were originally three birds perched on the fence, and now there are 11 storks joining them, the total number of creatures perched on the fence is 3 x 11 = 33. Therefore, the answer to the question is 33."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there are three storks and four birds already sitting on the fence. When four more birds come to join them, there will be seven birds in total (three storks + four birds). Therefore, the number of birds that sit on the fence is 7."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are three storks and two birds already sitting on the fence. When five more birds come to join them, there will be a total of eight creatures (three storks + two birds + five new birds) sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 8."
"Response: 10

Explanation:
The statement ""Sex storkar"" means six storks, and the phrase ""till dem"" implies that two more birds arrived later, making a total of eight birds (including the six storks). Therefore, there are ten storks sitting on the fence (six plus four = ten)."

Explanation: According to the question, there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 485 - 232 = 253."
"Response: 153
Explanation:
Let's assume that there are x number of boys in the school. Since there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys, we can write an equation:
x + (697 - 228) = 0
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 153
Therefore, there are 153 boys in the school."
"Response: 510

Explanation:
The question states that there are 635 girls in the school and the remaining students are boys. Therefore, if there are 510 more boys than girls, then there must be 510 boys in the school as well."

"Response: 1560
Explanation:
If there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in the school, then the total number of students in the school is 700 + (142 - 700) = 1560."
Response:  There are currently 938 students in the school (706 + 222 - 418).
Response:  There are 946 girls in the school now.
"Response: 79

Explanation:
Let's call the number of boys in the school x. Since 465 more girls enrolled than boys, the number of girls in the school is now x + 465.
We know that the total number of students in the school is 632 (females) + 410 (males), so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 465) = 632 + 410
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 465 = 1042
Subtracting 465 from both sides gives us:
2x = 577
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 288
Therefore, there are 79 more females than males in the school."
"Response: 954
Explanation:
The initial number of girls in the school is given as 732. When 682 more girls join the school, the total number of girls becomes:
732 + 682 = 1414
Now, 8 boys join the school, so the total number of students in the school is:
1414 + 8 = 1422
Therefore, there are 954 girls in the school now."

Question:  En man har $500 i kontanter och han spenderar $200 på en resa. How much money does he have left?   Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: $300 ($500 - $200)"
Response:  There are 694 people in the school (315 girls + 309 boys + 772 teachers).
"Response: 167

Explanation:
The ratio of girls to boys in the school is given as 402/739 = 58%. Therefore, if there are 739 girls in the school, there must be 739 x 58% = 416 boys in the school."
"Response: 1330

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Let X be the total number of students in the school.
According to the question, there are 458 more girls than boys, so the number of boys is X - 458.
Therefore, the number of girls is X + 458 = 692.
Now, we know that the sum of the number of boys and girls is equal to the total number of students, which is 1330 (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
X + (X - 458) = 1330
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2X = 1330
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
X = 665
So, there are 665 students in the school, including 458 girls and 207 boys."
"Response: 105
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of boys in the school is x. Since 403 more girls enrolled than boys, the number of girls in the school is x + 403 = 362 + 403 = 765. Therefore, there are 105 more girls than boys in the school."

Explanation: If 60 bird families flew away for winter and there are 19 bird families that live near the mountain, then the total number of bird families that left for winter is 60 + 19 = 79. Therefore, 79 - 19 = 59 more bird families stayed behind than flew away for winter."
"Response: 109
Explanation: If there are 87 bird families that live near the mountain and 7 of them flew away for winter, then there are 87 - 7 = 80 bird families that stayed behind. Therefore, there are 80 more bird families that stayed than those who flew away for winter."
"Response: 5

Explanation:
The passage states that ""20 families of birds flew away for winter"" and ""14 families stayed near the mountain."" Therefore, there were 5 families of birds that lived in the area near the mountain at the beginning of the passage."
"Response: 45
Explanation: If 23 bird families flew to Africa and 37 bird families flew to Asia, then there are 85 - 23 - 37 = 45 bird families left near the mountain."

"Response: 106
Explanation: According to the passage, 94 bird families flew to Asia and 47 bird families flew to Africa. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that flew to Asia and those that flew to Africa is 94 - 47 = 106."
"Response: 46

Explanation:
The passage states that there are 18 bird families that live near the mountain and that 38 of these families flew to Africa, while 80 flew to Asia. Therefore, the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter is 38 + 80 = 118."
"Response: 105

Explanation:
The statement ""Sommaren är snart här"" means that summer is approaching, and many animals migrate to cooler areas during this time. The passage mentions that there are 87 bird families that live near a mountain, and if 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain increases to 105."
"Response: 36

Explanation:
The passage states that ""59 fågelfamiljer flög iväg för vintern"" and ""24 nya fågelfamiljer kom från Arktis för att bo nära berget"". Therefore, there are 59 - 24 = 35 remaining bird families near the mountain after the migration."
"Response: 30

Explanation:
The passage states that ""om det bodde 41 fågelfamiljernear berget from the beginning"" which means that there were initially 41 bird families near the mountain. Then it says ""27 fågelfamiljer flög bort för vintern från ett berg"", which means that 27 bird families flew away for winter from the mountain. Therefore, the number of bird families left near the mountain is 41 - 27 = 14."
"Response: 39

Explanation:
The passage states that ""86 fågelfamiljer flöt bort för vintern från ett berg."" This means that 86 bird families flew away for winter from the mountain. In addition, it is stated that ""Om det bodde 45 fågelfamiljernear berget i början,"" which translates to ""If there were 45 bird families near the mountain in the beginning."" Therefore, we can conclude that there were 45 bird families near the mountain at the start of the season.

To find out how many more bird families flew away than stayed, we need to subtract the number of bird families that stayed (45) from the total number of bird families that flew away (86). This gives us a difference of 41 bird families. So, the answer is 41."

The passage states that 35 bird families flew to Asia and 62 bird families flew to Africa. To find out how many more birds flew to Africa than to Asia, we need to subtract the number of birds that went to Asia from the number of birds that went to Africa.

So, the difference between the number of birds that went to Africa (62) and the number of birds that went to Asia (35) is 62 - 35 = 27. Therefore, 27 more bird families flew to Africa than to Asia."
"Response: 18

"Response: 183

Explanation:
According to the question, Paul had 253 färgfärgpennor at the beginning of the school year and lost or gave away 70 of them by the end of the school year. Therefore, he had 183 färgfärgpennor left at the end of the school year."
"Response: 234

Explanation:
According to the question, Paul received 234 färgfärgpennor on his birthday. This is calculated by subtracting the number of pencils he lost or gave away (551) from the total number of pencils he had at the end of the school year (628)."
"Response: 392
Explanation:  If Paul had 440 färgfärgpennor and gave away 111 during the school year, he would have 329 pennors left (440 - 111 = 329). Then, if he lost 106 färgfärgfärg, he would be left with 223 pennors (329 - 106 = 223). Therefore, Paul had 392 färgfärgstift left (223 + 171 = 392)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 65 färgfärgpennor at first and gave away 213 during the school year. This means that he lost or gave away 16 penners (213 - 65 = 16). Therefore, there were 40 färgfärgpennors gone missing or given away."
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 589 paint colors at first and gave away 571 during the school year. This means he lost 161 paint colors. To find out how many more paint colors he gave away than he lost, we subtract the number of paint colors he lost from the total number of paint colors he had: 589 - 161 = 428. Therefore, he gave away 32 more paint colors than he lost (428 - 161 = 267)."
"Response: 358
Explanation:
According to the question, Paul had 110 paint colors in a box and gave away 90 of them during the school year. This means he has 20 (110 - 90) paint colors left. The question also states that he lost 412 paint colors, which is more than the number of paint colors he gave away. Therefore, the difference between the number of paint colors he lost and the number he gave away is 632 (412 - 90). So, Paul has 358 fewer paint colors now than he did at the beginning of the school year."
"Response: 1094
Explanation:
Paul had 1094 färgfärgpennor left after giving away 563 and losing 558. Therefore, he received 1094 färgfärgpennor for his birthday."
Response:  The correct answer is 107. According to the information provided in the question, Paul gave away or lost 535 - 52 = 107 färgfärgfärg during the school year.
"Response: 97
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 521 färgfärgpennor at first and used 66 of them during the school year. This means that he had 455 färgfärgpennor left after using 66 (455 - 66 = 389). The question also states that he did not lose or give away any färgfärgpennors, which means that all of the remaining pennors were accounted for. Therefore, the number of färgfärgpennors that went missing or were given away is equal to the total number of färgfärgpennors he started with minus the number he used during the school year, which is 521 - 66 = 455. So, 97 färgfärgpennors went missing or were given away."
"Response: 406

Explanation:
Paul had 531 färgfärg and 38 raderors at the beginning of the year. He used some of them during the school year and had 391 left at the end of the year. Since he didn't lose any raderigs, he must have used 40 (531 - 391 = 40) more färgfärg than raderogs. Therefore, he has 406 färgfärgkritor remaining (40 + 38 = 406)."
"Response: 265
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 601 färgfärg and 406 raderor at the beginning of the school year. He then used some of these items during the year but still had 336 left at the end of the year without losing any radergummis. Therefore, he has 265 rader remaining (601 - 336 = 265)."
"Response: 300

Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 300 color pencils on his birthday. The statement ""Vid slutet av skolåret hadde han bara 291 kvar"" means that he had only 291 pencils left after the school year ended, which implies that he must have started with 300 pencils in total (300 - 291 = 9)."
"Response: 59
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul had 267 färgfärgpennor at first and lost 231 during the school year. This means he has 267 - 231 = 136 färgfärgpennor left. He also gave away 308 färgfärgpennor to his friends, which is more than the number of pennors he lost. Therefore, the difference between the number of pennors he gave away and the number he lost is 308 - 231 = 77. So, Paul gave away 77 more färgfärgpennor than he lost."
"Response: 195

Explanation:
Paul had 457 rows and 320 colored pencils in his gift box at the beginning of the year. At the end of the school year, he had 523 remaining, which means he did not lose any colored pencils. Therefore, he gained 195 more colored pencils than rows (457 - 523 = -166)."

"Response: 37

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is that Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them at a garage sale. To find out how many books he has left, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had.

115 - 78 = 37

Therefore, Paul has 37 books left."
"Response: 200
Explanation: According to the question, after selling 137 books in a garage sale and having 105 left, Paul had initially 200 books. This is because he started with 200 books (the number of books he had before the garage sale) and sold 137 during the sale, leaving him with 105 remaining."
"Response: 47
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books at a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend, Paul had 62 books left. If he sold x books at the garage sale, then the total number of books he sold is equal to x + 35 (the number of books he gave away). Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 35 = 108 (since he started with 108 books). Solving for x, we get x = 47. So, Paul sold 47 books at the garage sale."
Response: 35 (50 - 15 = 35)
"Response: 230

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that Paul had two books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. After selling those books, he bought 150 new ones. Therefore, the total number of books Paul has now is 58 (the initial number of books) + 150 = 208 books. So, Paul has sold 208 - 2 = 206 books."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 21 books before selling some in a garage sale and then buying 42 new ones. If he has 15 books now, that means he has sold 39 more books than he has bought (21 - 15 = 39)."
"Response: 49
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 71 books before selling some in a garage sale. If he bought 38 new books after that, then he has 71 - 38 = 33 more books than he sold. Therefore, he has purchased 49 more books than he sold."
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, after selling some books and pens at a garage sale, Paul had 66 books and 59 pens left. If he started with 108 books and sold some of them at the garage sale, then he must have sold 32 books (108 - 66 = 32)."
"Response: 74
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, after selling some books and pens at a garage sale, Paul had 82 books and 14 pens left. If he sold x pens at the garage sale, then he would have 14 + x pens left. Since he started with 106 pens, that means he sold 74 pens at the garage sale (106 - 14 - x = 74)."
"Response: 59

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that Paul sold some books at a garage sale and received 27 books as payment. The number of books he received (27) is less than half of the total number of books he had initially (136). Therefore, to find out how many books Paul sold, we can subtract the number of books he received from the initial total:

Number of books sold = Initial total - Number of books received
= 136 - 27
= 109

So, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, after giving 39 books to his friend and selling some at a garage sale, Paul had 68 books left. Therefore, he must have sold 39 books at the garage sale."

Therefore, the number of pens he sold at the garage sale is 70."
Response:  There are now eight roses in the vase after Jessica clipped eight from her garden and placed them in it.
"Response: 0
Explanation: According to the passage, Jessica added 16 roses to the vase, which means there were initially 0 roses in the vase."
Response:  She cut 19 new roses from her garden to put in the vase, so she skared 19 rosors.
Response:  She clipped more than she threw away. So, the difference between the number of roses she threw away (33) and the number of roses she put in the vase (17) is equal to the number of additional roses she clipped from her garden (16). Therefore, she clipped 16 more roses than she threw away.
Response:  She threw away more roses than she cut from her garden. So, the difference between the number of rosors thrown away and the number of rosors cut is equal to the total number of rosors in the vase initially.  Therefore, the answer is 34 - 15 = 19.
Response: 7 - 3 = 4. So Jessica cut 4 roses from her garden to put in the vase.
"Response: 7

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally three roses in the vase (since it mentions that ""Det finns nu 19 rosor i vasen"" and not ""Det finns nu 19 roseor i vasen""). Therefore, Jessica must have cut three roses from her garden."
Response:  She cut 6 roses (since there were originally 13 and now there are only 7).
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, there were initially 3 orkidéer in the vase. Since Jessica has cut some from her own garden, there are now 7 orkidéer left in the vase. Therefore, she must have cut 3 orkidéer."

Explanation: According to the question, Danny already has 21 flasklocks in his collection before he found more in the park. Therefore, if he found 50 additional flask locks in the park, that means he now has a total of 71 flask locks (21 + 50)."
Response: 42 (Danny had 42 flasklockors when he started)
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 36 flask locks in the park and threw away 35 old ones. This means he has 22 flask locks left in his collection. To find out how many more flasks Danny found than he threw away, we can subtract the number of flasks he threw away from the total number of flasks he found: 22 - 35 = -13. Therefore, Danny found 13 more flasks in the park than he threw away."
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny found 30 flask locks in the park and threw away 63 old ones. This means he collected 42 new flask locks.

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Danny initially had 14 flasklockors (22 - 8 = 14)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 30 omslag in his collection initially. After he found 22 more flasklockors and 57 more forpacknings, he now has 17 fewer flasklockors and 40 more forpacknings than he originally had. Therefore, the number of omslagen that Danny had first is 40."
Response: 30
"Response: 37

Explanation:
The information given in the question is:

* Danny found 11 flask locks and 28 packages in the park. (Initial amount)
* Now he has 68 flask locks and 51 packages in his collection. (Final amount)

To find out how many more flask locks than packages Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of packages from the number of flask locks:

Number of more flask locks = Number of flask locks - Number of packages
= 68 - 28
= 40

Therefore, Danny found 40 more flask locks than packages in the park."
Response: 39 (28 + 16)
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Danny had 10 flasklockors initially and found 62 more in the park. Therefore, he now has 27 flasklockors + 62 = 89 flasklockors. Similarly, he had 62 forpacknings initially and found 43 more, so he now has 62 + 43 = 105 forpacknings. Since Danny started with 10 flasklockors and has 105 forpacknings, he has 5 more omslags than flasklockors."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Danny had 40 flasklockors initially and lost 66 of them in the park. Therefore, he has 25 flasklockors left in his collection, which is equal to 40 - 66 = -36."

Question:  If Danny had 32 bottle caps in his collection and he found 10 more in the park, how many bottle caps does he have now?  
Formula: 32 + 10 = 42
Answer: 42"
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 40 flasklockors initially. This is because it states that he threw away 60 old ones and found 58 new ones, which means he gained 58 - 60 = -2 new flasklockors. Therefore, Danny had 40 + (-2) = 38 flasklockors first."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 50 new flask locks and threw away 6 old ones in the park. So he gained 50 - 6 = 44 new flask locks. Therefore, Danny found 44 more flask locks than he threw away in the park."

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Danny found 82 omslags and 29 flasklockors in the park.
* Now he has 42 flasklockors and 61 forpacknings in his collection.
* Therefore, the number of flasklockors that Danny had initially is: 82 - 42 = 40."
"Response: 45
Question:  Danny has collected 16 bottle caps and 68 packaging materials. How many original packages had Danny at first?  Answer: 45"
"Response: 39

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Danny found 46 omslags and 50 flasklocks in the park.
* Now he has 21 flasklocks and 52 forpacknings in his collection.
* The number of flasklockers Danny found in the park is equal to the number of flasklockors he currently has in his collection minus the number of flasklockors he had before he started collecting them.
Therefore, the number of flasklockers Danny found in the park is:
39 = 50 - 21

Note that this calculation assumes that Danny did not find any additional flasklockors after he started collecting them. If he did find more than 50 flasklockors in the park, then the correct answer would be greater than 39."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 65 packages and 5 bottle caps in the park initially. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 packages. To find out how many more bottle caps than packages Danny found, we subtract the number of packages from the initial number of bottle caps: 65 - 9 = 56. Therefore, Danny found 24 more bottle caps than packages in the park."
"Response: 46
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Danny had 58 flasklockors before he started collecting them in his collection box. After he collected 11 more flasklocks and 25 omslags, he now has 46 flasklocks in total (58 - 11 = 46)."
"Response: 49

Explanation:
The information given in the question is:
Danny has 67 for packagings and 35 bottle caps.
He found 15 bottle caps and 18 packages in the park.
Now he has 35 bottle caps and 67 packages in his collection.

Response:  Jeff now has 798 kort.
"Response: 278
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs before giving some of her cards away to Jeff. After giving some of her cards away, she has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card packs left. To find out how many more baseball cards than ten that Nell has, we need to subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball cards. So, the answer is 278 (415 - 149)."
"Response: 73

Explanation:
Nell had initially 246 baseball cards and 214 10-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, who now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10-card packs. To find out how many more 10-card packs than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of 10-card packs that Jeff received from the total number of 10-card packs that Nell had.

Initially, Nell had 214 10-card packs, which is equal to 214 x 10 = 2140 10-card packs. Since Jeff received 495 10-card packs, Nell must have given him 2140 - 495 = 1645 10-card packs.

Therefore, Nell has 73 more 10-card packs than baseball cards."
Response: 148
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card sets. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, who now has 55 ten-card sets and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards than ten that Nell has, we need to subtract the number of ten-card sets that Jeff has from the total number of baseball cards that Nell had. So, the answer is 26 (438 - 55 = 383)."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 38 10-kort and 239 baseball cards initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, who now has 376 10-kort and 111 baseball cards. To find out how many more 10-kort than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has from the total number of 10-kort she had initially. So, the difference between 38 (initial number of 10-kort) and 111 (number of baseball cards she still has) is 45. Therefore, Nell has 45 more 10-kort than baseball cards."

"Response: 43

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is that Josh had some bullets in his collection and lost 21 of them. If he has 12 bullets now, it means he started with x bullets (where x is the number of bullets he had initially). Since he lost 21 bullets, we can set up the equation:

x - 21 = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 43

Therefore, Josh had 43 bullets in his collection to start with."

"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, 10 barn got off the bus at the bus stop while some others boarded the bus. Therefore, there were 10 barn in the bus when it left the bus stop."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Fem barn var med i bussen."" - This means that 5 children were already on the bus.
* ""Vid busshållplatsen gick 63 barn av bussen medan några gick ombord på bussen."" - This means that 63 children got off the bus at the stop and some new children boarded the bus.
* ""Då var det 14 barn i bussen."" - This means that after 63 children got off and some new children boarded, there were 14 children left in the bus.

Now, let's find out how many more children took the bus than those who came off:

Total number of children who took the bus = Total number of children who came off + Number of new children who boarded
= 5 (initially on the bus) + 63 (came off) - 14 (remaining in the bus)
= 68 - 14
= 54

Therefore, the answer is 54."
"Response: 54 - 12 = 42
Question:  36 barn were in the bus when it departed from the station. When it arrived at the next stop, 68 children got off the bus while 12 more boarded. How many more children got off than boarded the bus?  Solution: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and after arrival at the next stop, 68 children got off and 12 children boarded. So, the change in number of children in the bus is given by: Change in Number of Children = 68 - 12 = 56 Now, we are asked how many more children got off than boarded the bus. To find this, we subtract the number of children who boarded from the number of children who got off: More Children Got Off = 56 - 12 = 44 Therefore, 44 more children got off the bus than boarded it."
"Response: 38
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* 22 barn were on the bus initially.
* 40 barn got off the bus at the stop.
* 2 barn remained on the bus.

So, the total number of barn that got off the bus is: 40 - 2 = 38."
"Response: 46 - 30 = 16
Explanation: If 28 children were on the bus initially and 82 children got on at the bus stop, then there are 104 children in total (28 + 82). When 30 children got off the bus, there are 74 children left (104 - 30). Therefore, the number of more children that took the bus than got off is 16 (74 - 58)."
"Response: 17
Explanation:
The number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who went on the bus minus the number of children who were already on the bus at the bus stop. Therefore, we can calculate the difference as follows:

Number of children who got off = Number of children who went on - Number of children who were already on
= 24 - 8
= 16

So, there were 16 more children who got off the bus than those who got on."

133 - 51 = 82

So, Baker produced 82 more tårtor than he sold."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Bäckaren (the baker) made 54 tårtor and sold some of them. If he has 13 tårtor left, that means he sold 41 tårtor. Therefore, Baker sold 10 tårtor."
"Response: 308

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is that Bäckaren (the baker) made some tarts and sold 145 of them. If he has 72 tarts left over, then he must have made a total of 308 tarts (145 + 72 = 308)."
"Response: 15 - 140 = 75 tårtor

Answer Explanation:
The baker made 155 tårtor in total. If his friend bought 140 tårtor from him, then the baker would have 15 - 140 = 75 tårtor left."

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* Bäckaren (the baker) made 13 tårtor (tarts).
* He sold 91 tårtor.
* He bought 154 new tårtor.

To find out how many more tårtor the baker bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of tårtor he sold from the number of new tårtor he bought:

91 - 13 = 78

So, the baker bought 78 more tårtor than he sold."
"Response: 42

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that Bäckaren (the baker) made 170 tårtor and sold 78 of them. He also bought 31 new tårtor. To find out how many more tårtors the baker sold than he bought, we need to subtract the number of tårtor he bought from the number of tårtor he sold:

Sold - Buyed = 78 - 31 = 47

So, the baker sold 47 more tårtor than he bought."
"Response: 24
Explanation:
The baker made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. This means he has 35 tarts left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made 76 more tarts, which brings the total number of tarts to 101 (35 + 76 = 101). So, the baker has 101 tarts left."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
The baker made 144 tarts initially and sold 71 of them. Then he made 111 more tarts. So, the total number of tarts he made is 144 + 111 = 255. Since he sold 71 tarts, the number of tarts he has left is 255 - 71 = 184. Therefore, the baker made more tarts than he sold by 184 - 71 = 113."
"Response: 35

Explanation:
If Bäckaren made 149 tårtor and 91 bakverk, and he sold 10 kakor, then he has 90 bakverk left (91 - 10 = 81). Therefore, Baker would have 35 kakors left (35 = 81 - 46)."

Response: 39 more kakors than bakverk.
"Response: 46

Explanation:
If Bäckaren sold 70 kakor and 88 bakverk, then he sold a total of 70 + 88 = 158 items. Since he made 131 bakverk, this means that he had 158 - 131 = 27 more bakverk than kakor. Therefore, Bäckaren has 46 more bakverk than kakor."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The number of kakors sold by the baker is given as 158. The number of bakverks sold is given as 169. Therefore, the difference between the number of kakors and bakverks sold is:

Explanation:  The question states that there are 20 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If you have not read five of them, then you have only read 5 out of 20, or 5/20 = 1/4."
"Response:  There are currently 21 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response: 8

Explanation:
If there are 22 books in the series and you have already read 12 of them, that means you have 22 - 12 = 10 more books to read. Similarly, if there are 10 films in the series and you have seen 56 films, that means you have 10 - 56 = -44 films left to watch. Therefore, you have 8 books left to read."
"Response: 5

Explanation:

"Response:  You have read eight books from ""The Crazy Silly School"" series. If there are a total of 14 different books in the series, you still have six more to read."
"Response: 28

Explanation:
If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School"", that means you have seen 34 / 4 = 8 films per book. Therefore, if there are 19 books in the series, you have 8 x 19 = 152 films left to watch. However, since you have already watched 34 of them, that means you have 152 - 34 = 118 films left to watch. So, you have 118 books left to read."

"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Razorback T-shirt-butiken tjänar $23 per sold T-shirt. Since they earned $230 during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 230 / $23 = 15 T-shirts."
Response:  $17
"Response:  $102

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* The Razorback T-shirt butikens average profit per shirt is $87.
* They sold 95 T-shirts during both Arkansas and Texas Tech matches.
* They sold 47 T-shirts during Arkansas match.

To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas match, we can use the following calculation:

Total amount of money made = Number of T-shirts sold x Average profit per shirt
= 47 T-shirts x $87
= $4,099

Therefore, the Razorback T-shirt butikens made $4,099 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas match."
"Response: 78

Explanation:
If they sold $106 per shirt during Arkansas match and sold 242 total shirts during both matches combined, then they made a total revenue of $242 x $106 = $25,320 from shirt sales. If they sold 115 shirts during Arkansas match, then they sold $106 x 115 = $12,190 from shirts sold during that match alone. Therefore, they sold $12,190 - $25,320 = $-13,130 worth of shirts during Texas Tech match."
"Response:  $89
Explanation:  If they sold 163 T-shirts in total and 89 were sold during the Arkansas match, then they made $89 in revenue from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas match."
"Response:  $304
Explanation:
If they sold 186 T-shirts during both matches and made $78 per shirt, then they made a total of $1492 ($78 x 186) in revenue from T-shirt sales. Since they sold 172 T-shirts during the Texas Tech match, they made an additional $304 ($78 x 172) in revenue from T-shirt sales during that match alone. Therefore, the answer is $304."
"Response:  $10,570

Explanation:
To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts, we need to multiply the number of T-shirts sold by the price per T-shirt. In this case, they sold 183 T-shirts at $62 each, so the total revenue from T-shirts is:

183 x $62 = $11,496

Therefore, the Razorback-butiken made $11,496 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech match."
"Response:  $165 x 74 = $12,090

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
"Response:  $68

Explanation:
To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a tröja, we need to subtract the cost of a tröja from the total revenue generated by selling t-shirts and tröjor during the match. According to the question, the total revenue was $192 for each t-shirt and $34 for each tröja. Therefore, the total revenue from selling t-shirts and tröjor during the match is:

$192 x 157 = $29,090 (t-shirts)
$34 x 19 = $656 (tröjor)
Total revenue = $29,090 + $656 = $30,746

Now, let's find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a tröja:

Cost of a t-shirt - Cost of a tröja = Total revenue - ($30,746 / 157 t-shirts)
= $30,746 - ($200.67 / 157)
= $68

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $68 more than a tröja."
"Response:  $190

Explanation:
To find out how much more a tröja costs than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a tröja. According to the information given in the question, the price of a t-shirt is $86 and the price of a tröja is $232. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a tröja and a t-shirt is:

$232 - $86 = $146

So, a tröja costs $146 more than a t-shirt."
"Response:  $692

Please explain how you arrived at this answer."
"Response:  $3580

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* Razorback-t-shirtbutiken sells each t-shirt for $201 dollars.
* During the Arkansas and Texas Tech match, they increased the price of each t-shirt by $217 dollars.
* They sold 14 t-shirts during this match.

To find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the match, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price at which they were sold before and after the increase.

Number of t-shirts sold = 14
Original price of t-shirts = $201
Increased price of t-shirts = $217 (during the match)
Total amount earned from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold x Original price of t-shirts
= 14 x $201
= $2854

However, since they sold some t-shirts at the increased price of $217 during the match, we also need to subtract that amount from the total amount earned.

Total amount earned from selling t-shirts = $2854 - ($217 x 14)
= $2854 - $2968
= -$1114

Therefore, the answer is $3580."
Response: 300 t-shirts were sold by the Razorback t-shirt store during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game if they earned $10 per shirt and made $60 in total revenue from selling t-shirts.
Response:  $42.70
Response:  $20 x 20 = $400.
"Response:  $204
Explanation: According to the passage, each tröja brings in $76 dollars and each t-shirt brings in $204 dollars. Since they sold 2 tröjor during the match, they brought in $146 ($76 x 2) dollars from those sales. Additionally, they sold 158 t-shirts, which means they brought in $31,960 ($204 x 158) dollars from those sales. Therefore, the total amount of money they made from selling tröjor and t-shirts is $32,066 ($146 + $31,960)."
"Response:  $56

Explanation:
To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a jersey. According to the passage, the price of a jersey is $240 and the price of a t-shirt is $56. Therefore, the difference between the two prices is:

$240 - $56 = $184

So, a t-shirt costs $184 more than a jersey."
"Response:  $49
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Razorback-butiken made $115 per jersey and $25 per t-shirt. Since they sold 78 jerseys and 113 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, we can calculate the difference between the cost of a jersey and a t-shirt as follows:

$115 - $25 = $90

Therefore, a Razorback jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt."

"Response:  $394
Explanation:
Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, which is equal to $45,840. If he has to pay $702 in taxes, that means he will have $394 left at the end of the harvest season."
"Response: 40689000

Question:  If Lewis works for 73 years and earns $1357 per week during each of those years, how much money does he make in total over his career?

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked by the amount earned per week. Since Lewis works for 73 years, he works a total of 73 x 52 = 3752 weeks. Therefore, his total income over his career is:

$1357/week x 3752 weeks = $40689000

So, Lewis makes a total of $40689000 over his 73-year career."

Response:  The water is 60 feet deep (5 x 12 + 3).
Response: 27 meters.
"Response: 20 meters
Explanation:
Ron's height is 4 meters and Dean is 3 meters longer than Ron, so Dean's height is 7 meters (4 + 3). Since the water is 16 times Ron's height, it would be 16 x 4 = 64 meters deep. However, since Dean is taller than Ron, he would need to add his own height of 7 meters to the depth of the water, making it 64 + 7 = 71 meters deep."
Response:  The water depth is 9 x (Ron's height) = 45 meters.

"Response: 4563

Explanation:
Melissa scored 109 points in each match and received 82 bonus points in each match. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can multiply her score per match by the number of matches she played:

"Response: 350
Explanation:
The number of classrooms in the school is given as 21. Since there are 98 students in the school and 7 buses, each bus can accommodate at most 14 students (i.e., 98 / 7 = 14). Therefore, there are 350 seats available in all 7 buses combined (14 x 7 = 98)."
Response:  The number of students in the school is 84 x 95 = 8020.
"Response: 3
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students (66 x 6 = 390) by the capacity of each bus (6). Therefore, 3 buses are needed to take the entire school on an outing."
"Response: 3
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. Since there are 58 students in the school and 2 students per bus, we can calculate that 29 buses are needed (58 / 2 = 29). However, since there are already 2 students in each bus, we only need 1 additional bus to accommodate all the students, so the final answer is 3 buses."
"Response: 36
Explanation: To find out how many students are in each class, we need to divide the total number of students (120) by the number of classes (24). This gives us an average of 5 students per class. Since there are 84 seats in each bus, we can subtract this amount from the total number of students to get the number of students who will be attending the field trip. Therefore, there will be 36 students in each class."
"Response: 3
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students (102) by the number of seats available in each bus (8). This gives us a total of 12.5 buses needed for the field trip. Since you cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number and conclude that 3 buses are needed for the field trip."
"Response: 34
Explanation: If 8 students do not want to go on the field trip and there are 102 classrooms in the school, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is:
34 = 102 - 8
Therefore, 34 students will go on the field trip."
"Response: 3
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students in the school (111) by the number of students that can fit in each bus (72). This gives us a ratio of approximately 1.56 buses needed for the trip. Since there are three seats in each bus, we round up to the nearest whole number and conclude that 3 buses are needed for the trip."
"Response: 35
Explanation: If there are 46 school buses and 92 students in the school, then each bus can hold approximately 2 students (based on rounding). Therefore, there are 35 seats available in each bus."

Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave five kulors to each of the five boys she liked playing with. Therefore, in total, she gave 5 x 5 = 25 kulors away."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, there are 4 boys who love to play marbles. If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she has 9 marbles left over. Therefore, each boy gets 9/4 = 7 marbles."
"Response: 49
Explanation: If Halleys has 26 kulors and 50 boys are playing, then each boy will get 26/50 = 0.52 kulors. Since you can't have a fraction of a kuler, each boy will get 49 kulors."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Haley has 20 balls and she divides them equally among her classmates, then each of the two boys in her class will receive 4 balls."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave two kulors to each of the boys she liked playing with. If she had 28 kulors and gave them to 14 boys, then she must have given 2 kulors to each of those 14 boys."

Explanation:
To find out how many days it took Frank to read the book, we need to divide the number of pages in the book (392) by the number of pages he reads per day (14). This gives us a total of 56 days."
Response:  The book has 22 pages.
Response:  The number of pages Frank read per day is 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day.
"Response: 16
Explanation:  If Frank took 220 days to write the book and there are 5 chapters with an equal number of pages each (555 pages total), then we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:
Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 pages / 5 chapters
= 111 pages per chapter
Therefore, there are 111 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 2.47 (rounded to one decimal place)
Explanation: To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the number of days it took him to write the book by the total number of pages in the book. Since there are 15 chapters in the book and each chapter has an equal number of pages (193), we can calculate the average number of pages per chapter as follows:
Average number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 193 / 15
= 13 pages per chapter
Now, let's calculate the number of chapters Frank read per day:
Number of chapters read per day = Total number of days / Average number of pages per chapter
= 660 / 13
= 50 chapters per day (round to nearest integer)
Therefore, Frank read approximately 50 chapters per day."
"Response: 73
Explanation:
Frank took three days to read each book, so he read a total of 3 x 249 = 747 pages. Since he read one book every day, he read 747 / 3 = 249 pages per day."

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Frank read some books.
* Each book had 66 pages.
* It took Frank 12 days to read each book.
* If it takes him 492 days to read all the books, then he has read 492 / 12 = 41 books.
Therefore, the answer is 30 (books)."
Response: 4.5 pages/day
"Response: 8 days

Explanation:
The question states that Frank read eight pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages he read by the number of pages in the book: 8 pages/day / 576 pages = 8 days."
Response: 72 pages/day

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Frank read through his favorite book.
* The book had three chapters with 594 pages each.
* It took Frank 607 days to write the book.

To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters:

Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter
= 3 x 594
= 1782 pages

Therefore, there are 1782 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it took Frank 664 days to read his favorite book. If he had two chapters with 405 pages each, then he would have read approximately 810 pages per day (2 x 405)."
Response:  Each DVD-paket costs $10.
Response: 33 x 81 = 2633 dollars.
"Response: 5
Explanation:
If each DVD pack costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 on each package, then the cost per package after the discount is $1 = $106. If you want to buy 5 packages with $93 each, you can do so because $93 > $106 (the cost after the discount). Therefore, the answer is 5."
Response: 49 dollars.
"Response: 4
Explanation: To find out how many DVD packs can be bought with $104, we need to divide the amount of money by the cost of each DVD pack. $104 / $26 = 4. So, you can buy 4 DVD packs with $104."

Response:  There are 9 groups of bananas in size two.
"Response: 3569

Explanation:
The given information can be interpreted as follows:

* ""Philipps banan samling"" means ""Philipp's banana collection"".
* ""Om bananerna är organiserade i 140 grupper av storlek 187"" means ""If the bananas are organized into 140 groups of size 187"".
* ""Hur många bananer han har i sin samling?"" means ""How many bananas he has in his collection?"".

To find the number of bananas in Philipp's collection, we need to calculate the product of the number of groups and the size of each group. Based on the information provided, there are 140 groups of bananas, and each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas in Philipp's collection is:

140 x 187 = 26,960

So, Philipp has 26,960 bananas in his collection."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Since there are 203 bananas and 63 apricots in Philip's collection, we can assume that each group of bananas contains an equal number of fruit. Therefore, if the bananas are organized into 7 groups, then each group must contain 28 bananas (203 / 7 = 28). Similarly, since the apricots are organized into 95 groups, each group must contain 6 apricots (63 / 95 = 0.66). So, the size of each group of bananas is 28, and the size of each group of apricots is approximately 0.66."
"Response: 178

Explanation:
The number of groups of bananas is given as 47, and the number of groups of apricots is given as 178. Therefore, each group of apricots has 356 / 178 = 2 apricots."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Since each group contains 392 bananas, the size of each group is 392/196 = 40 bananas."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there are 18 bananas in each group of size 18. Therefore, if there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection, there will be 180 / 18 = 10 groups of bananas."
"Response: 56

Explanation:
Let's assume that each group of bananas contains x bananas. Since there are 2 groups of bananas, the total number of bananas is 2x.
We know that the total number of bananas is equal to the sum of the number of bananas in each group, so we can write:
2x = 290

Now, let's find out how many bananas are in each group by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of groups:
2x / 2 = 56

Therefore, each group of bananas contains 56 bananas."

"Response: 420

Answer Explanation:
The question states that Brenda's mother made cookies for 14 people and each person had 30 cookies. To find out how many cookies Brenda's mother made in total, we can multiply the number of people by the number of cookies each person had. Therefore, the answer is 420 (14 x 30 = 420)."
"Response: 50

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that Brenda's mother made cookies for five people and that she made 22 cookies but had to throw away 17 of them. To find out how many cookies each person got, we can divide the total number of cookies (22) by the number of people (5):

22 / 5 = 4.4

So each person got approximately 4-5 cookies. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cookie, let's round up to 5 cookies per person. Therefore, there were 50 cookies in total (5 x 10 = 50)."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Brenda's mother made 18 kakors and each guest received an equal number of kakors. Therefore, if 9 guests did not come, that means 10 guests came, which is why Brenda's mother prepared 10 x 18 = 180 kakors in total."
"Response: 28
Explanation: According to the question, Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for two guests. If all the guests had the same number of cookies, then the total number of cookies shared among them is 14 / 2 = 7. Therefore, each guest received 7 cookies."

"Response: 1985
Explanation:
If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 246 visitors that day, then the total number of visitors over 25 days would be:
703 + (246 x 24) = 1985
Therefore, the answer is 1985."
"Response: 44
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 666 visitors the day of the question. To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day, we subtract the number of visitors the day before from the number of visitors the day of the question: 666 - 100 = 566. Therefore, 566 more people visited Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day."
"Response: 327

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* After a good meal, they went to see Buckingham Palace.
* Rachel found out that 132 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day.
* The palace has had 327 days of visits during the past 327 days.

To find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day before, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 132 / 327
= 0.40 (or 40%)

So, approximately 40% of the total number of visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day before."
"Response: 1067

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is that 45 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before and 829 people visited during the last 85 days. To find out how many people visited on the specific day mentioned in the question (the day after the good meal), we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the total number of visitors over the last 85 days. Therefore, the answer is:

1067 = 829 - 45 + 1

So, 1067 people visited Buckingham Palace on the day after the good meal."
"Response: 3600
Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
* There were 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace.
* 557 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day.
* The previous day had 188 visitors.
To find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace during 57 days, we can use the following formula:
Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors per day x Number of days
In this case, the total number of visitors is 557 + 188 = 745.
Dividing this by the number of visitors per day (which is 557/188 = 2.9) gives us the average number of visitors per day: 2.9 visitors/day.
Now, multiplying this by the number of days (57 days) gives us the total number of visitors: 2.9 x 57 = 161.3.
Therefore, there were approximately 161 visitors to Buckingham Palace every day for 57 days."
"Response: 21
Explanation:
If there were 600 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 661 visitors that day, then the difference between the two days is 661 - 600 = 61. Therefore, there were 61 more visitors to Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day."
"Response: 568

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after lunch = 92
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before = 419
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace 3 days ago = 103

Using these numbers, we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 4 days as follows:

Day 1: 419 visitors
Day 2: 92 visitors + 419 visitors = 511 visitors
Day 3: 103 visitors + 511 visitors = 614 visitors
Day 4: 92 visitors + 614 visitors = 706 visitors

Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 4 days is 706."
"Response: 363

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* On the day after their meal, Rachel and her family went to see Buckingham Palace.
* There were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day.
* The number of visitors the previous day was 471.
* The number of visitors 89 days ago was 808.

To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace during the last 89 days, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + (Number of visitors today - Number of visitors yesterday) +... + (Number of visitors 89 days ago - Number of visitors 88 days ago)

Using this formula, we get:

Number of visitors = 512 + (471 - 471) +... + (808 - 737) = 363

Therefore, there were 363 people who visited Buckingham Palace during the last 89 days."
"Response: 368
Explanation:
To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace than in the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors the day before from the current day's visitors.

Let's use the information given in the question:

* On the day after Rachel visited Buckingham Palace, there were 705 visitors.
* The day before Rachel visited Buckingham Palace, there were 191 visitors.
* 457 visitors came to Buckingham Palace the day before that (the day before the day before).

So, if we subtract the number of visitors the day before from the current day's visitors, we get:

705 - 191 = 514

This means that 514 more visitors came to Buckingham Palace than in the previous 245 days."

"Response: 106 grams
Explanation:
If he needs 22 grams of vax to cover 353 grams of feathers and he already has 106 grams of vax, then he has enough vax to cover 353 / 106 = 3.3 feathers."
Response:  He needs an additional 146 grams of wax (166 - 20 = 146).
"Response: 430 grams
Explanation:
To find out how much wax is needed to cover all of the feathers, we need to divide the total amount of wax by the number of feathers. According to the problem, there are 557 grams of wax and he needs only 17 grams in total. Therefore, each feather requires 17 / 557 = 0.0302 grams of wax. Since there are approximately 100 feathers (based on the information provided), we can calculate the total amount of wax required as follows: 0.0302 x 100 = 3.02 grams. So, fjädrarna behöver 3.02 grams av vaxen."
"Response: 560 grams

The problem states that the mail carrier sends 14 spam emails to each house in a quarter and must give two spam emails to each quarter. Therefore, if there are x houses in a quarter, the total number of spam emails sent by the mail carrier is 14x. Since the mail carrier must give two spam emails to each quarter, the total number of spam emails given out is 2(14x). Therefore, we can set up the equation: 14x = 2(14x) which simplifies to x = 7. So, there are 7 houses in a quarter."

"Response: 20
Explanation:  According to the question, each group of eleven people will have two eggs, so there are 11 groups in total. Therefore, the total number of eggs is 11 x 2 = 22 eggs. Since each person has two eggs, the total number of eggs that Rebecca has is 22 / 11 = 20 eggs."
Response: 4 groups of eggs with 2 eggs each = 8 eggs total.
Response: 3 groups of eggs = 9 eggs per group (4 kulor x 15 ägg) / 3 groups = 9 eggs per group.
"Response: 3
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, Rebecca will divide the eggs into six groups. Since she has 18 eggs, each group will contain 18/6 = 3 eggs."
"Response: 30 groups
Explanation:  To determine how many groups will be created, we need to divide the total number of items by three (the number of eggs in each group). We get:

99 bananas / 3 = 33 groups of bananas
9 eggs / 3 = 3 groups of eggs
27 kulor / 3 = 9 groups of bullets
Therefore, there will be 30 groups in total."
"Response: 5
Explanation:  According to the question, Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 bullets. If she divides the eggs into groups of five, then she will have 4 groups of eggs (20 / 5 = 4). Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than bullets by 4 - 6 = 2."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Rebecca has five kulors and twelve eggs. To determine how many eggs she has more than kulors, we can subtract the number of kulors from the total number of eggs: 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Rebecca has seven eggs more than kulors."
