Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 18 friends and they are all girls. Secondly, we know that each friend of Julia has an average of 5 male friends. Finally, we want to find out how many male friends Julia has in total. So, let's calculate it!  Number of female friends of Julia = 18 x 5 = 90 Male friends of Julia's friends = 90 x 5 = 450 Total number of male friends of Julia = 450 Therefore, the answer is 450.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has tagged 12 photos with the theme ""Travel"" and 8 photos with the theme ""Food"".  Therefore, the total number of photos tagged by Julia is 12 + 8 = 20 photos.  Now, let's calculate the average number of likes per photo based on the information provided in the question.  We know that Julia has received 350 likes on her photos, and she has posted 20 photos in total.  So, the average number of likes per photo is 350 / 20 = 17.5 likes per photo."
Response:  If there are 16 people in total and each person has to take turns being the leader for 5 minutes at a time, then how many times will each person be the leader overall?  To calculate this, we can use the formula: Total number of leaders = Number of people x Time spent as leader per person / 5 minutes per turn. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Total number of leaders = 16 x (5 minutes/person) / 5 minutes/turn = 16 x 10 / 5 = 80 times. So, each person will be the leader 80 times overall.
"Response:  If Julia has 14 friends and each friend brings 3-5 people to play cards, then the total number of people playing cards is:

14 x 3 = 42 people

So, there are 42 people playing cards in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 12 friends and they are all girls.  Secondly, we know that each friend of Julia has an average of 3 tags in their Instagram posts.  Lastly, we want to find out how many tags Julia has used in her posts.  Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Number of tags = Total number of friends x Average number of tags per friend So, the answer is: Number of tags = 12 x 3 = 36 tags.
Response:  If there are 14 days in a week and each day has 24 hours, then there are 336 hours in a week (14 x 24 = 336). Now, let's calculate how many hours are left after subtracting the number of hours spent studying from the total number of hours in a week. We know that the student spends 8 hours per day studying, so we can calculate the total number of hours spent studying in a week as follows: Total hours studying per week = Number of days studying x Hours studied per day = 7 days x 8 hours/day = 56 hours/week Now, let's compare the total number of hours spent studying with the total number of hours in a week to see how much time is left for other activities: Total hours studying per week - Total hours in a week = 56 hours/week - 336 hours/week = -280 hours/week This means that the student has more than enough time to engage in other activities such as playing sports, hanging out with friends, or pursuing their interests outside of school.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: 20th November 1975 Date of the second event: 3rd December 1975 Subtracting these two dates gives us: 30 days So, there are 30 days between the two events. Now, let's calculate the number of people who attended each event. For the first event, we have: Number of people attending = Total number of students x Percentage of students who attended  Total number of students = 18000 Percentage of students who attended = 60% (as given in the question) Therefore, the number of people who attended the first event is: Number of people attending = 18000 x 60% = 10800 people For the second event, we have: Number of people attending = Total number of students x Percentage of students who attended Total number of students = 20000 Percentage of students who attended = 40% (as given in the question) Therefore, the number of people who attended the second event is: Number of people attending = 20000 x 40% = 8000 people Finally, we need to find out how many people attended both events. To do this, we simply add the number of people who attended the first event and the number of people who attended the second event: Number of people attending both events = Number of people attending the first event + Number of people attending the second event = 10800 + 8000 = 18800 people So, there were 18800 people who attended both events.
Response:  If Julia has tagged 16 people in her post at 8 am on Monday, and 32 people have liked it, then we can calculate the number of views as follows: Number of views = (Number of likes x Number of tags) / 100  In this case, the number of views would be: Number of views = (32 x 16) / 100 = 512  So, there are approximately 512 views of Julia's post.
Response:  If Julia has 5 days off from work and she starts her vacation at 9 am on day 1, then she will have 24 hours of free time in that day (from 9 am to 9 pm). Similarly, if she takes another 3 days off after that, she will have 72 hours of free time (from 9 am to 9 pm) on those days as well. Therefore, the total number of hours of free time Julia has during her 8-day vacation is:  5 x 24 = 120 hours + 3 x 72 = 216 hours = 336 hours
Response:  If Julia has two children and they are born on different days of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday), then we can determine their birthdays as follows:  Day 1: Sunday - Julia's first child is born on this day.  Day 2: Monday - Julia's second child is born on this day.  Day 3: Tuesday - Julia's second child is born on this day.  Day 4: Wednesday - Julia's second child is born on this day.  Day 5: Thursday - Julia's second child is born on this day.  Day 6: Friday - Julia's second child is born on this day.  Day 7: Saturday - Julia's second child is born on this day. Therefore, the answer to the question is:  Yes, Julia's second child was born on one of these seven days.
Response:  If Julia has 8 friends and each friend brings 5 guests, then the total number of people at the party is:  8 x 5 = 40 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 days in a week. So, if today is Monday (day 1), then tomorrow will be Tuesday (day 2).  If we count continuously like this, we will reach Sunday (day 7) after 7 days. Now, let's come back to Monday (day 1) and count forward again for another 7 days, which will take us to Saturday (day 8). Therefore, the total number of days between Monday and Saturday is 8 days.
Response:  We know that there are 8 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we start counting from Monday (day 1), then the total number of hours in a week is: 8 x 24 = 192 hours. Now, let's count how many hours are left after subtracting the time spent studying English: 192 - 30 = 162 hours. Therefore, the remaining hours in a week for other activities are 162 hours.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 days in a week (Monday to Sunday).  Secondly, we know that Julia has tagged 3 people per day on average.  Therefore, the total number of people Julia has tagged is:

$$ \text{Total number of people tagged} = \frac{\text{Number of days}}{\text{Number of people tagged per day}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text{Total number of people tagged} = \frac{16}{\frac{3}{2}} = 8 $$

Therefore, Julia has tagged $8$ people in total."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: 2018-05-30 Date of the second event: 2019-06-04 Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is: 30 - 4 = 26 days.  Now, let's calculate the number of weeks between these two dates. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7 to get the number of weeks: 26 / 7 = 3.67 weeks. Since we cannot have a fraction of a week, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 weeks.  Finally, we multiply the number of weeks by 7 to get the total number of days: 4 x 7 = 28 days. So, the answer to the question is 28 days.
Response:  If there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours, then there are 7 x 24 = 168 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours the baby slept during that time. According to the question, the baby slept for 10 hours per night, which means it slept for 10 x 7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, the answer is 168 - 70 = 98 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 12 friends and they are all girls.  Secondly, we know that each friend of Julia has an average of 3.4 tags on their social media accounts. Finally, we want to find out how many tags Julia's friends have in total. So, let's multiply the number of friends Julia has (12) with the average number of tags per friend (3.4). Therefore, the total number of tags Julia's friends have is: 12 x 3.4 = 40.8 Tags.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 days in April and 30 days in May. So, if the last day of April is on the 30th, then the first day of May must be on the 1st.  Next, we know that the exam will take place on the 28th of May. Therefore, the number of days between the first day of May and the exam date is: $ \boxed{28 - 1 = 27} $ days.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we start counting from Sunday (day 1), then Monday will be day 2, Tuesday will be day 3, Wednesday will be day 4, Thursday will be day 5, Friday will be day 6, and Saturday will be day 7. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Yes, the fifth day of the month falls on a Friday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 18 years old and she will have her birthday party on Saturday, March 20th.  Secondly, we are given that there are 4 guests invited to the party, including herself. Thirdly, we are told that each guest will bring $5 as a gift for Julia. Finally, we are asked how much money Julia will receive in total from all the guests at her party. Based on the information provided, Julia will receive a total of $20 ($5 x 4) from all the guests at her party. Therefore, the answer is $20.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if Julia started her work at 8 am on Monday, she will finish her work at 5 pm on Tuesday (Monday + 1 day = Tuesday). Therefore, Julia worked for 36 hours (from 8 am Monday to 5 pm Tuesday).  Next, we know that there are 7 working days in a week, so Julia worked for 259 hours in total (36 hours/week x 7 weeks).  Finally, we subtract the number of hours Julia took off during the year, which is 10 days (1 month x 30 days/month) or 240 hours (10 days x 24 hours/day). Therefore, Julia worked for 235 hours in total throughout the year (259 - 240 = 235 hours).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has been working at the company for 20 years and he is currently 58 years old (from the information provided). Therefore, if he started working at the age of 38, it means he was born in 1974.  Secondly, from the given information, we can see that Bobby has worked for 20 years, which means he has worked for half of his life. So, if he works for another 10 years, he will have worked for 60% of his life. Finally, based on the information provided, Bobby will retire at the age of 65, so he has 10 years left to work before he retires.
Response:  Bobby has 28 years old and he has been working for 10 years. So, his total work experience is 28 + 10 = 38 years. Now, let's calculate how much money he has earned so far. If he earns $40,000 per year, then his total income from work is 38 x $40,000 = $1,520,000. Finally, if he saves $50,000 per year, then his total savings is 10 years x $50,000 = $500,000. Therefore, Bobby has saved $500,000 in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has been to Cambodia three times and stayed there for 30 days each time. So, in total, he has spent 90 days (3 x 30) in Cambodia.  Secondly, we are told that Bobby has visited 14 provinces in Cambodia. Therefore, the number of provinces Bobby has not visited is 14 - 7 = 7 provinces. Finally, we are asked how many days Bobby has spent in those 7 provinces that he has not visited. Since he has not visited them, the answer is zero days (0).  So, the final answer is:  Bobby has spent 90 days in Cambodia and zero days in the 7 provinces he has not visited.
Response:  Bobby has 38 teeth and he brushes them for 3 minutes each day. Therefore, he spends 38 x 3 = 114 seconds brushing his teeth every day.  Now, let's calculate how many years it takes to brush all of his teeth. There are 87,600 seconds in a year (24 hours x 365 days). So, Bobby will take approximately 114 / 87,600 = 0.013 years to brush all of his teeth.
Response:  Bobby has been working for 20 years and has saved $34,000. He wants to retire at age 65 with a monthly income of $1,800. To calculate how much he needs to save each year, we can use the following formula: Retirement savings = Monthly income x Number of years until retirement So, in this case, Bobby needs to save: Retirement savings = $1,800 x 27 (years until retirement) = $50,400 per year Now, let's check if Bobby has enough money to retire comfortably based on his current savings. If he saves $50,400 per year for 27 years, he will have: Total savings = Annual savings x Number of years saving = $50,400 x 27 = $1,309,600 By comparing the total amount he needs to save ($1,309,600) with the amount he currently has ($34,000), we can see that Bobby does not have enough money to retire comfortably. Therefore, he should continue to work and save more money to achieve his retirement goal.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has 20 cents in his pocket.  Then, he buys an ice cream cone for $1.50. So, he pays with his 20 cents and gets $1.30 change. Next, he goes to buy a toy car for $8.99. He doesn't have enough money, so he borrows $7 from his friend. Finally, he returns the borrowed money plus the remaining amount of money he had ($0.60) to his friend. Therefore, the total amount of money Bobby has after returning the borrowed money is $7 + $0.60 = $7.60.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has 22 teeth and he brushes them every day for 3 minutes each time. So, in total, he spends 66 minutes (22 x 3) brushing his teeth per day. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends brushing his teeth per week. There are 7 days in a week, so Bobby spends 66 minutes/day x 7 days/week = 452 minutes/week brushing his teeth. Finally, to convert this value into hours, we divide it by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, Bobby spends approximately 7.5 hours (452 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) brushing his teeth per week.
"Response:  We know that Bobby has 18 balls and he wants to put them in his pocket. Each ball takes up space of 0.5 cubic centimeters (cm³). So, we need to calculate how many pockets are needed to hold all the balls.

Firstly, let's convert the volume of each ball from cm³ to liters (L):

1 cm³ = 0.001 L

So, the total volume of 18 balls is:

V = 18 x 0.001 L = 0.018 L

Now, we need to divide the total volume of the balls by the volume of one pocket to find out how many pockets are needed:

Number of pockets = V / Volume of one pocket
Volume of one pocket =?

We know that Bobby wants to put all the balls in his pocket, so the volume of one pocket must be equal to or greater than the volume of one ball. Therefore, the volume of one pocket is:

Volume of one pocket = 0.5 cm³

Now, we can plug in the values we have found into the equation:

Number of pockets = V / Volume of one pocket
= 0.018 L / 0.5 cm³
= 36 pockets

Therefore, Bobby needs 36 pockets to hold all 18 balls."
Response:  We know that Bobby has 32 teeth and he brushes them twice a day for 2 minutes each time. So, in one day (24 hours), Bobby brushes his teeth 6 times (2 x 2 = 6). Now, let's calculate how many times Bobby brushes his teeth in a year (365 days): 6 times/day x 365 days/year = 2190 times/year. Therefore, Bobby brushes his teeth approximately 2190 times per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has 18 years old and he is in grade 12 ( cambodian education system). So, he will graduate from high school at age of 19.  Secondly, we know that he wants to study abroad for his bachelor degree, which means he needs to leave Cambodia after graduation. Thirdly, we are given that he will start studying abroad at the age of 20. Therefore, the number of years he will spend studying abroad is 4 years (from age 20 to 24). Finally, we are asked how many times he will return to Cambodia during those 4 years. Since he left Cambodia at age 19 to study abroad, he will return to Cambodia once when he finishes his bachelor degree at age 24. So, the answer is 1 time.
"Response:  If Bobby has 23 cats and each cat has 30 kittens, then we have:

Number of kittens = Number of cats x Number of kittens per cat
= 23 x 30
= 690 kittens

So, there are 690 kittens in total."
Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 3 balls. To find out if Allan has more or less balls than Jake, we need to compare their total number of balls. So, the total number of balls for both Allan and Jake is: 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, Allan has more balls than Jake (5 > 3).
Response:  We know that Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 3 balls. Now we need to find out how many more balls Jake has than Allan. So, let's subtract the number of balls Allan has from the number of balls Jake has:  Number of balls Jake has - Number of balls Allan has = 3 - 2 = 1  Therefore, Jake has one more ball than Allan.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three options for the number of people who have been to the beach: 0, 1, or 2.  Next, we consider the possibility that none of them (option 0) has been to the beach. If this is the case, then all of them must be at home (option 1). Therefore, the probability of option 1 occurring is 1/3.  Now let's move on to the second part of the question. We are told that among those who have been to the beach, some have gone swimming. However, we don't know how many of them have gone swimming. So, we cannot determine the probability of any particular person going swimming based on their presence at the beach alone. In other words, the probability of someone going swimming given that they have been to the beach is unknown. Thus, we assign a probability of 0.5 to each of the two remaining options (i.e., either 0.5 or 0.5), as neither of these options provides any additional information about whether a particular person went swimming or not. Finally, we multiply the probabilities of each of the four options together to get our overall answer: Option 1 x Option 0 = 0.167Option 2 x Option 0 = 0.333Option 2 x Option 1 = 0.5Option 0 x Option 1 = 0.5So, the total probability of the correct answer being 3 is: 0.167 + 0.333 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.467.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 balls and he wants to give them equally among his friends. So, we need to divide 6 balls into 4 equal parts or groups. Each group will have 1 ball each. Now, let's assume that Allan is one of Jake's friends who received 1 ball from Jake. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balls and he wants to give one of them to Jake. So, there are 5 balls left for Allan. Now, we need to find out how many balls Jake will get from Allan. From the question, we know that Jake gets 6 balls more than what Allan gives him. Therefore, the number of balls Jake will get from Allan is:

$$ \boxed{6} $$

So, the final number of balls Allan has is:

$$ \boxed{5 - 6 = -1} $$

Therefore, the answer is $-$1."
Response:  We know that Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls. If we want to find out how many balls they have in total, we need to add their numbers together. So, the total number of balls owned by Allan and Jake is: 3 + 5 = 8 balls. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 4 balls. So, in total, they have 3 + 4 = 7 balls. Now, we are asked how many more balls Allan has than Jake. To find this out, we subtract the number of balls Jake has (4) from the total number of balls Allan and Jake have (7): 7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, Allan has 3 more balls than Jake.
Response:  We know that Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 6 balls. If we want to find out how many more balls Jake has than Allan, we can simply subtract the number of balls Allan has from the number of balls Jake has: 6 - 2 = 4. So, Jake has 4 more balls than Allan.
Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 4 balls. So, in total, they have 9 balls (5 + 4). Now, we are asked how many balls Allan threw to make it so that there were 3 balls left when he stopped throwing. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of balls Allan threw from the total number of balls he had at first (5). Therefore, Allan threw 2 balls (5 - 3 = 2).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 2 balls.  Now, let's consider how many balls are left after Jake takes one ball from the pile of 8 balls (Allan's 6 + Jake's 2). So, there are 3 balls left (8 - 1 = 7). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 3 balls. When Jake throws one ball to Allan, he will have 4 balls left (since he already had 3). So, after Jake threw one ball to Allan, Jake had 3 - 1 = 2 balls left. Now, let's count how many balls Allan has after receiving the ball from Jake: Allan + Jake's remaining balls = 6 + 2 = 8 balls. Therefore, after Jake threw one ball to Allan, Allan had 8 balls in total.
Response:  According to the question, Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 6 balls. To find out how many balls Jake has after giving one ball to Allan, we need to subtract 1 from 6, which gives us 5. So, Jake has 5 balls left after giving one ball to Allan.
Response:  We know that Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls. So, in total, they have 8 balls (3 + 5). Now, we are asked how many balls Allan and Jake have together after 20 days. Since Jake has 5 more balls than Allan, Jake will have 20 - 3 = 17 additional balls. Therefore, Allan and Jake together have 8 + 17 = 25 balls after 20 days.
Response:  We know that Allan has 7 balls and Jake has 6 balls. So, if we want to find out how many balls they have in total, we can simply add their numbers together: 7 + 6 = 13. Therefore, Allan and Jake have 13 balls in total.
Response:  The number of cats that can fit in a basket is 5. Now, let's assume we have 8 baskets. So, the total number of cats that can fit in all the baskets together is 5 x 8 = 40. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 balls and he throws them equally among his friends. Since there are 4 friends including himself, each friend will get 1 ball. So, the number of balls that Jake gives to each friend is 1. Now, let's count how many balls Allan gets from Jake. Allan receives 2 balls from Jake, so the answer is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan has 6 days off from work. So, he will have 6 x 24 = 144 hours of free time during those 6 days. Now, let's assume that he spends 8 hours per day on leisure activities (watching TV, playing video games, etc.). Therefore, he will spend 144 hours / 8 hours/day = 17.5 days on leisure activities during his 6-day break. Since there are 7 days in a week, Ryan will spend 17.5 days / 7 days/week = 2.5 days on leisure activities each week.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between Ryan's birthday and his wedding day. According to the information provided in the question, Ryan was born on March 20th, and he got married on August 1st. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is 5 months (March 20th - August 1st). So, there are 5 months x 30 days per month = 150 days between Ryan's birthday and his wedding day. Now, let's count how many times Ryan has celebrated his birthday since he was born until he got married. Based on the information provided in the question, Ryan was born on March 20th, so he has celebrated 24 birthdays (March 20th - August 1st) until he got married. Finally, let's calculate how old Ryan was when he got married by subtracting the number of years he had been alive from the current year. According to the question, the current year is 2023, and Ryan was born in 1998, which means that he was 25 years old when he got married in 2023. Therefore, the answer to the question is 24 + 25 = 49.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between Ryan's birthday and today. We know that Ryan was born on March 25th, so today is (date). Therefore, the difference between their birthdays is:  March 25 - (date) = x days  Next, we need to find out how many times Ryan has celebrated his birthday since he was born. We can do this by subtracting the number of years since Ryan's birth from the current year:  Years since Ryan's birth = 2023 - 1998 = 45 years  Now, let's calculate the total number of birthdays Ryan has had:  Total number of birthdays = years since birth x number of days per year = 45 x 365 = 16,375 days  Finally, we need to divide the total number of birthdays by the number of days between Ryan's birthday and today to get the approximate number of birthdays Ryan has left:  Approximate number of birthdays left = total number of birthdays / difference between birthdays = 16,375 / x = approximately 45 years and 8 months  So, based on the calculation above, Ryan has approximately 45 years and 8 months left before he celebrates his next birthday.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between Ryan's birthday and his father's birthday. We know that Ryan was born on March 25th, and his father's birthday is on April 10th. So, there are 16 days between their birthdays. Now, let's count how many days are there between Ryan's current age and his father's current age. According to the information given in the question, Ryan is currently 3 years old, and his father is 40 years old. Therefore, there are 37 years between Ryan's current age and his father's current age (40 - 3 = 37). Finally, we need to add the number of days between Ryan's birthday and his father's birthday with the number of years between their ages to get the total number of days that Ryan has been alive. In this case, the total number of days that Ryan has been alive is 16 + 37 = 53 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between Ryan's birthday and his current age. We know that Ryan was born on March 20th, so his birthday is on day 89 of the year (March 20th - February 28th). Therefore, the difference between Ryan's birthday and his current age can be calculated as follows:  Current Age - Birthday = Current Age - 89 = x Where x represents the number of years that have passed since Ryan's birthday. Now, we need to find out how many months have passed since Ryan's last name change. According to the question, Ryan changed his last name 3 times, and each time he changed it, he added 1 month to his previous name. So, if Ryan changed his last name 3 times, then the total number of months that have passed since his last name change can be calculated as follows: Number of Months = 3 x 12 = 36 months Finally, we need to add the number of months that have passed since Ryan's last name change to the number of years that have passed since his birthday to get the total number of months that Ryan has been alive. Total Number of Months = Current Age - Birthday + Number of Months Since Last Name Change = 25 + 36 = 61 months Therefore, Ryan has been alive for 61 months since his last name change.
Response:  If Ryan has 10 days off from work and he wants to spend 5 days with his family, then he will have 5 days left for other activities.  So, the number of days that Ryan can spend on other activities is 5.
"Response:  If Ryan has 6 days off and he works for 5 days in a week, then he will have 1 day off during the week (since there are only 5 days of work). So, if he takes his days off alternately, he will take one day off every two weeks. Therefore, the number of days he will have taken off after 2 months is:

$$ \text {Number of days taken off} = \frac{\text{Total number of days off}}{2\times\text{Number of weeks in 2 months}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of days taken off} = \frac{6}{2\times 8} = 3 $$

Therefore, Ryan will have taken 3 days off after 2 months."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan has 6 days off from work.  Secondly, he wants to spend 4 of those days with his friends and family. Therefore, the number of days he can spend alone is 6 - 4 = 2 days.
Response:  If Ryan has been working for 4 months (ម៉ោង រៀនភាសាអង់គ្លេស) and he has worked every day of those 4 months (ទៅដូចហើយ), then we can calculate the total number of days he has worked as follows:  Total workdays = Number of months x Number of working days per month  Total workdays = 4 x 30 Total workdays = 120 days So, Ryan has worked for 120 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in each month of the year. There are 12 months in a year and each month has either 30 or 31 days except for February which has 28 days (in non-leap years) or 29 days (in leap years). Therefore, the total number of days in a year is:

$$ \text{Total number of days} = 12 \times \frac{\text{Number of days in each month}}{365} $$

Now, let's calculate the number of days that Ryan can spend with his family during each trip:

$$ \text{Days spent with family} = \frac{\text{Total number of days}}{\text{Number of trips}} $$

We know that Ryan takes 4 trips per year, so the number of days he spends with his family is:

$$ \text{Days spent with family} = \frac{365}{4} = 91 \text{ days} $$

Therefore, Ryan can spend approximately 91 days with his family during each year."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days in 6 months which is equal to 180 days. Then, we need to subtract the number of days that Ryan spent studying English (3 months x 30 days/month = 90 days) and the number of days he spent traveling (58 days). Therefore, the final answer is: Total number of days - Number of days spent studying English - Number of days spent traveling = 180 - 90 - 58 = 24 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days in 3 years. There are 365 days in a year, so there are:

3 x 365 = 1095 days

Now, let's count how many times Ryan can go to school in 3 years:

Ryan goes to school every day, so he can attend school for:

1095 days / 365 days per year = 3.04 years

Therefore, Ryan can attend school for approximately 3.04 years."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days in each month. There are 12 months in a year, and each month has either 30 or 31 days (except for February which has 28 days). Therefore, the total number of days in a year is:

12 x 30 = 360 days

Now, let's count how many days Ryan spent studying English during his 2-year study plan:

Year 1: Ryan studied English for 30 days per month x 12 months = 360 days
Year 2: Ryan studied English for 31 days per month x 12 months = 372 days

Therefore, Ryan spent a total of 732 days studying English over the course of two years."
Response:  If we have $3$ days to learn how to speak English fluently and correctly, then we can divide it into $2$ parts:  Day $1$: Learn basic vocabulary and grammar rules. Day $2$: Practice speaking and listening skills. So, the total number of hours needed to learn English fluently is: $3 \times 2 = 6$ hours per day $\times$ $2$ days = $12$ hours. Therefore, the total number of hours needed to learn English fluently in $3$ days is $12 \times 3 = 36$ hours.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between 20th and 30th of any month. To do this, we can use the formula: (30 - 20) = x, where x is the number of days. Therefore, the answer is 10 days. Next, we need to find out how many times the word ""រៀន"" appears in the text. We can count the number of occurrences of each word using the following formula: (Number of words - Number of spaces) / Number of letters in the word. For example, if the word ""រៀន"" appears 5 times in the text, we can calculate its frequency as follows: (5 - 1) / 4 = 1.25. Finally, we need to multiply the number of days by the frequency of the word ""រៀន"" to get the total number of appearances of the word in the given time period. So, the answer is 10 x 1.25 = 12.5 appearances of the word ""រៀន""."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany has 8 diamonds and she wants to sell them.  Secondly, we are given that the price of each diamond is $1000.  Therefore, the total value of all 8 diamonds is $8000 (8 x $1000).  Lastly, we are asked how much money Tiffany will have after selling all 8 diamonds. So, the answer is $8000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany has 3 dogs and each dog has 4 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is 3 x 4 = 12 puppies.  Next, we are asked how many puppies Tiffany will have after 2 weeks. Since it takes 60 days for a puppy to grow into an adult dog, Tiffany will have 12 x 2 = 24 puppies after 2 weeks. Finally, we are told that Tiffany already had 12 puppies before she went to bed at 8 pm. So, the correct answer is (12 + 24) = 36 puppies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany has 4 dogs and she wants to sell them for $10 each. Therefore, the total amount of money Tiffany can earn from selling her dogs is:   $4 x 10 = $40   So, Tiffany will have $40 after selling all four dogs.  Now, let's consider the second part of the question. According to the passage, Tiffany has been working at the restaurant for 2 years and 8 months. In total, she has worked there for 30 months. If she works there for another 6 months, how many months will she have worked there in total?   $30 + 6 = 36$ months   So, Tiffany will have worked at the restaurant for 36 months in total.
Response:  We know that Tiffany has 40 bracelets and she wants to give them away as gifts. She has already given 8 of them away so far. Therefore, the number of bracelets left for her to give away is:  40 - 8 = 32.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany has 10 diamonds and she wants to sell them.  Secondly, we are given that there are 3 buyers who want to purchase the diamonds. Thirdly, each buyer is willing to pay $50 for each diamond. Therefore, if all three buyers purchase one diamond each, they will collectively pay $150 (3 x $50) to Tiffany. However, since Tiffany has 10 diamonds in total, if she sells all of them to these three buyers, she will receive a total of $150 x 10 = $1,500. So, her profit is $1,500 - $150 = $1,350.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany has 8 diamonds and she wants to sell them.  Secondly, we are given that each diamond costs $1000. Therefore, the total cost of all 8 diamonds is $8000. Thirdly, we are told that Tiffany has been offered $4000 for all 8 diamonds. Finally, we need to calculate the profit or loss made by Tiffany. To do this, we subtract the amount offered ($4000) from the total cost ($8000), which gives us a profit of $4000. So, the answer is $4000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany has 3 dogs and each dog has 4 puppies. Therefore, the total number of dogs is 3 x 4 = 12 dogs.  Next, we are asked how many puppies Tiffany has in total. Since each dog has 4 puppies, the total number of puppies is 12 dogs x 4 puppies/dog = 48 puppies.  Finally, we are asked if Tiffany has any other pets besides dogs and puppies. Based on the information provided earlier, Tiffany does not have any other pets besides dogs and puppies. So, the answer to this part of the question is No.  In conclusion, the total number of dogs and puppies that Tiffany has is 12 dogs + 48 puppies = 60 pets.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 questions in total. So, we can start by counting how many questions have answers starting with ""ពោតក្រហម"" (which means ""What is your name?"" in English). There are 6 questions that start with this phrase. Therefore, the number of questions that do not start with ""ពោតក្រហម"" is 18 - 6 = 12."
Response:  We are given two numbers $x$ and $y$. We want to find out how many times larger than $x$ is $y$. So we can write: $$ \frac{y}{x} = k \Rightarrow y = xk $$ Now we are asked to find out how many times larger than $x$ is $y$. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $x$: $$ \frac{y}{x} = k \Rightarrow \frac{y}{x} = \frac{xk}{x} = k $$ Therefore, $y$ is $k$ times larger than $x$. Since $k$ is a constant, we can simplify the answer as follows: $$ y = x\times k $$ In conclusion, there are $\boxed{k}$ times more $y$ than $x$.
Response:  We know that there are 10 questions in total and each question has 4 options to choose from. So, we have a total of 40 options to choose from. Now, let's assume that you have answered all the questions correctly and got 15 marks out of 40. This means that you have scored 37.5% (15/40) of the total marks. Therefore, your score is 37.5%.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""khmer"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the word ""khmer"".  From the given text, we have:

K - 3 occurrences
H - 2 occurrences
M - 4 occurrences
E - 1 occurrence
R - 1 occurrence
Total = 10 letters
So, the word ""khmer"" appears 10 times in the given text. Now, let's count the total number of words that contain the letter combination ""kh"":

Words containing ""k"" and ""h"":

1. khmer (10 times)
Total = 10 words
Therefore, the answer is 10."
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many questions are there in total. There are 10 questions in total. Now, let's count the number of options for each question. For the first question, there are 3 options. For the second question, there are 5 options. For the third question, there are 7 options. Therefore, the total number of options is 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  The first part of the question is asking about the number of people who have been to school. We are given that there are 30 students in total and we need to find out how many of them have been to school. To do this, we can use division. So, if there are 30 students in total and 15 of them have been to school, then the number of students who have not been to school is: Number of students who haven't been to school = Total number of students - Number of students who have been to school = 30 - 15 = 15 Therefore, 15 students have not been to school. Now let's move on to the second part of the question. The second part of the question is asking about the number of teachers who teach at the school. We are given that there are 8 teachers in total and we need to find out how many of them teach at the school. To do this, we can use division again. So, if there are 8 teachers in total and 4 of them teach at the school, then the number of teachers who don't teach at the school is: Number of teachers who don't teach at the school = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers who teach at the school = 8 - 4 = 4 Therefore, 4 teachers don't teach at the school.
Response:  We have two groups of people: Group A and Group B. Each group has 6 members. The total number of people in both groups is 6 x 2 = 12. Now we add one more person to Group A, making it 7 members strong. So, the new total number of people is 12 + 1 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people in both groups combined.
Response:  We know that there are 18 questions in total and we have already answered 6 of them correctly. So, the number of remaining questions is 18 - 6 = 12. Now, let's calculate the probability of answering each question correctly based on the given information. Since there are 3 options for each question, the probability of choosing the correct option is (1/3). Therefore, the probability of answering all 12 remaining questions correctly is (1/3)^12 = 0.00000000577.
Response:  We have 6 + 90 = 96 cards in total. Then we divide it by 2 to get the number of pairs: 96 / 2 = 48 pairs. Finally, we subtract the number of pairs that are not complete (i.e., 16): 48 - 16 = 32 complete pairs. Therefore, there are 32 complete pairs of cards among the 96 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many questions are there in total. There are 18 questions in total. Now, let's count the number of options for each question. For question 18, there are 4 options. Therefore, the total number of options is 4 x 18 = 72. So, the answer is 72.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many questions are there in total. There are 5 options for each of the first 4 questions, so the total number of questions is: 5 x 4 = 20. For the last question, there are only 3 options, so the total number of questions is: 20 + 3 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 questions in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the Khmer alphabet and each letter has its own unique sound. So, if we want to count the number of sounds in Cambodian language, we need to count the number of distinct sounds for each letter.  There are 5 vowels in Cambodian language which are ""a"", ""i"", ""u"", ""e"" and ""o"". Each vowel has one or more corresponding diphthongs (combination of two vowels pronounced together). For example, ""ai"" is a diphthong consisting of the vowels ""a"" and ""i"". Similarly, ""ou"" is also a diphthong consisting of the vowels ""o"" and ""u"". Therefore, we have a total of 10 diphthongs in Cambodian language.  Now let's move on to consonants. In Cambodian language, there are 14 consonant phonemes (distinct sounds) which can be either voiced or unvoiced. These include stops, fricatives, nasals, liquids, semivowels, and approximants.  Finally, we need to consider the syllable structure of Cambodian language. A syllable in Cambodian language consists of a nucleus (vowel + consonant) followed by an optional coda (consonant + vowel). The number of syllables in a word depends on the number of syllables in the root word and any prefixes or suffixes added to it.  Based on these factors, we can estimate the number of sounds in Cambodian language as follows:  Vowels: 5 Diphthongs: 10 Consonants: 14 Syllable structure: variable Total number of sounds: approximately 39-40  Therefore, the answer to the question is around 39-40 sounds in the Cambodian language."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of people who have been vaccinated with at least one dose. According to the question, there are 105,672 people in the target group, and 80% of them have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, the total number of people who have been vaccinated with at least one dose is:

$$ \text {Total number of people vaccinated} = \frac{0.8 \times 105,672}{1} = 84,363 $$

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of people who have completed their full vaccination course. According to the question, 80% of the target group has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which means that 80% of 84,363 people (the total number of people vaccinated) have completed their full vaccination course. Therefore, the percentage of people who have completed their full vaccination course is:

$$ \text {Percentage of fully vaccinated people} = \frac{0.8 \times 84,363}{105,672} \times 100\% = 78.6\% $$"
"Response:  The question asks for the number of times "" Cambodia has won the ASEAN Football Championship"" and ""the number of times that Thailand has won it"". So we need to count the number of times each country has won the championship.  For Cambodia, they have won the championship once in 2013. Therefore, the answer is:  Cambodia - 1 Thailand - 8 (Since Thailand has won the championship 8 times)  Total: 9"
"Response:  The first part of the question is asking for the total number of balls that are blue and red. We know that there are 10 blue balls and 5 red balls in total. So, the answer to the first part of the question is:

Total number of blue balls = 10
Total number of red balls = 5

Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. It asks for the total number of balls that are either blue or red. To find this, we need to add the total number of blue balls and red balls together. Therefore, the answer to the second part of the question is:

Total number of balls that are either blue or red = Total number of blue balls + Total number of red balls = 10 + 5 = 15

So, the final answer to the question is:

Total number of balls that are blue or red = 15"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the number 4 appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the text. There are four occurrences of the digit 4 in the text: ""មានបង្អួចពោតមួយចំនួន កញ្ចប់មួយមានពោតក្រហមចំនួន ៤ និងពោតក្រហមចំនួន ៣"". Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 types of questions in this passage:  (1) How many... have you done? and (2) How many... do you want to buy?  For the first type of question, the answer is 4 because the speaker has done 4 things: watched TV, played video games, read books, and listened to music.  For the second type of question, the answer is 12 because the speaker wants to buy 12 items from the store. Therefore, the total number of answers is 4 + 12 = 16.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""ផ្លែ"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After counting, we will get a total of 12 instances of the word ""ផ្លែ"".  Next, we need to divide the total number of instances of the word ""ផ្លែ"" by the number of lines in the given text. In this case, there are 30 lines in the text. So, we will divide 12 by 30, which gives us an average of 0.4 per line. Therefore, the answer is 0.4."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 people in Group A and 4 people in Group B.  Therefore, the total number of people in both groups is:

$$ \text {Total Number of People} = \text {Number of People in Group A} + \text{Number of People in Group B} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text {Total Number of People} &= 18 + 4 \\ &= 22 \end{aligned} $$

So, there are 22 people in both groups combined."
Response:  We are given that there are 10 balls in total and we need to find out how many of them are red. So, let's assume that among these 10 balls, x are red. Now, we know that each ball has a probability of being red which is 3/5. Therefore, the number of red balls can be calculated as follows: Number of red balls = Total number of balls x Probability of a ball being red  Number of red balls = 10 x (3/5) = 6 So, there are 6 red balls out of the total 10 balls.
Response:  We are given that there are 6 circles and each circle has 60 points inside it. So, in total, we have 6 x 60 = 360 points inside the circles. Now, we need to find out how many of these points are outside the circles. To do this, we can simply subtract the number of points inside each circle from the total number of points. For example, if we take the first circle, there are 60 points inside it, so the number of points outside the first circle is 360 - 60 = 300. Similarly, for the second circle, there are 54 points inside it (since 60 - 6 = 54), so the number of points outside the second circle is 300 - 54 = 246. And so on... Therefore, the final answer is 246 points outside all six circles.
Response:  Jerry has 4 cards left in his hand and he draws another card from the deck. So now he has 5 cards in total (the one he drew plus the 4 remaining ones). Then, he discards one of those cards to get rid of it. Now he has 4 cards again. He repeats this process until he gets rid of all his cards. Therefore, the number of times Jerry draws a card from the deck is 4.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that Jerry has been working at his current job. According to the question, he started working there 3 years ago, so he has worked for 3 years \* 365 days/year = 1095 days.  Next, we need to find out how many hours Jerry works per day. The question states that he works from 8am to 5pm, which means he works for 9 hours per day (from 8am to 5pm). Therefore, the total number of hours Jerry has worked in the past 3 years is 1095 days \* 9 hours/day = 9715 hours.  Finally, we need to convert these hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes Jerry has worked in the past 3 years is 9715 hours \* 60 minutes/hour = 576,450 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of years that Jerry has worked as an engineer. According to the question, he started working as an engineer in 1985 and stopped working in 2017, which means he worked for 32 years (from 1985 to 2017). Therefore, the answer is: Total number of years Jerry worked as an engineer = 32 years.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of projects Jerry managed during his career as an engineer. According to the question, Jerry managed 4 major projects and 16 minor projects, which means he managed a total of 20 projects (4 major + 16 minor) during his career as an engineer. Therefore, the answer is: Total number of projects Jerry managed = 20 projects.
Response:  Jerry has 5 dogs and 8 cats. He wants to know how many animals he has in total. To find out, we need to add the number of dogs and cats together, which gives us 13 (5 + 8). So, Jerry has 13 animals in total.
Response:  Jerry has 2 cards and draws 10 cards from the deck. Since there are 52 cards in a standard deck of cards, the probability that he drew all hearts is (1/52)^10 = 0.000000000679348. Therefore, the probability that Jerry did not draw any hearts is 1 - 0.000000000679348 = 0.999999993306052.
"Response:  Jerry has 8 balls and he wants to put them in 9 boxes. Each box can hold at most 3 balls. So, we need to find out how many ways Jerry can divide his 8 balls into 9 boxes without exceeding the limit of each box.

There are 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320 possible ways to arrange the 8 balls.

Now, let's count the number of ways that Jerry can divide his 8 balls into 9 boxes without exceeding the limit of each box:

For the first box, Jerry can choose any 3 balls from his 8 balls, so there are 8 × 3 = 24 ways to fill the first box.

For the second box, Jerry can choose any remaining 3 balls from his 5 balls (since he already used 3 balls for the first box), so there are 5 × 3 = 15 ways to fill the second box.

For the third box, Jerry can choose any remaining 3 balls from his 4 balls (since he already used 3 balls for the first two boxes), so there are 4 × 3 = 12 ways to fill the third box.

And so on...

So, in total, there are 24 + 15 + 12 +... + 1 = 40,320 - 4 = 40,316 ways that Jerry can divide his 8 balls into 9 boxes without exceeding the limit of each box."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has 3 dogs and 2 cats.  Therefore, the total number of pets he has is 3 + 2 = 5.  Secondly, we are asked how many dogs Jerry has. Since there are 5 pets in total, and dogs account for 3 of them, Jerry has 3 dogs.  Finally, we are asked how many cats Jerry has. As there are only 2 cats among all his pets, Jerry has 2 cats.  So, to summarize, Jerry has 3 dogs and 2 cats.
Response:  Jerry has 5 dogs and 3 cats. He wants to know how many animals he has in total. To find out, we need to add the number of dogs and cats together, which gives us 8 animals (5 + 3 = 8). So, Jerry has 8 animals in total.
Response:  Jerry has 8 balls in his pocket and he takes out 4 of them to play with. After playing for some time, he puts back 3 of the same balls that he took out, leaving him with only one ball less than what he had initially (7 balls). So, the number of balls Jerry has left after playing is 7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has been working at his current job for 3 years (Year 1). In Year 2, he was promoted to a manager position and received an additional $5000 salary increase. Therefore, his total income in Year 2 is $60,000 + $5000 = $65,000.  Next, we are told that Jerry saved $10,000 of his Year 2 income. So, his remaining income after saving $10,000 is $65,000 - $10,000 = $55,000.  Now, let's move on to Year 3. We are given that Jerry earned $70,000 in Year 3, which is higher than his previous year's income ($65,000). However, we also know that he spent $8,000 on a new car, so his disposable income (i.e., money left over after paying taxes) is $70,000 - $8,000 = $62,000.  Finally, we are asked how much money Jerry has saved overall since he started working at his current job 3 years ago. To calculate this, we need to add up all the savings amounts from each year: $10,000 + $15,000 + $20,000 = $45,000.  Therefore, the answer to the question is: Jerry has saved a total of $45,000 since he started working at his current job 3 years ago.
Response:  If Jerry has 10 balls and he throws them all at once into a basket with 8 holes, then... (calculate the probability)...the probability that all of his balls go through is $\frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}$. So, the number of balls that will go through the basket is $4$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has 10 balls in his pocket.  Secondly, he throws one ball and catches it back. So, now he has 9 balls left in his pocket. Thirdly, he throws another ball and catches it back again, so now he has 8 balls remaining in his pocket. Finally, he throws the last ball and doesn't catch it back, so now he has no balls left in his pocket. Therefore, the number of balls Jerry had after throwing all the balls is zero (0).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry has 8 balls in his pocket.  He takes out one ball and throws it away.  Now he has 7 balls left.  Then, he takes out another ball and throws it away too.  So now he has 6 balls remaining.  Next, he takes out another ball and throws it away again.  Therefore, he has 5 balls left.  Finally, he takes out the last ball and throws it away, leaving him with no balls at all!
Response:  Jerry has 3 balls and he throws them into 4 boxes. Each box can hold at most 2 balls. So, after throwing all 3 balls, how many of them will be left in the boxes? The answer is 0. None of the balls will be left in the boxes because each box can only hold up to 2 balls, and Jerry threw 3 balls in total. Therefore, none of the balls will remain in the boxes.
Response:  Jerry has 3 dogs and 2 cats. He wants to know how many animals he has in total. To find out, we need to add the number of dogs and cats together, which gives us 5 animals in total that Jerry owns. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that there are 6 stages of sleep in a complete sleep cycle: N1, N2, N3, REM-1, REM-2, and REM-3. Each stage has a specific duration, as follows: N1 (5-10 minutes), N2 (20-40 minutes), N3 (20-30 minutes), REM-1 (5-7 minutes), REM-2 (5-7 minutes), and REM-3 (5-7 minutes). Therefore, if we assume that the person is experiencing a normal sleep cycle with all six stages present, then the total time spent in each stage would be: N1 + N2 + N3 + REM-1 + REM-2 + REM-3 = 6 x (5-7 minutes) = 90-120 minutes. So, the answer to the question is between 90 and 120 minutes.
Response:  We know that there are 4 options for the number of cards in the deck: 13, 14, 15, or 16.  Since we have already eliminated option 13 (there are only 3 cards of each rank), we can narrow it down to options 14, 15, or 16.  However, since we also know that there are 5 suits in the deck, and each suit has 13 ranks, we can deduce that there must be at least 5 x 13 = 65 cards in the deck. Therefore, the correct answer is option 16, which means there are 65 cards in the deck.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last time the king visited the temple. According to the information provided in the question, it has been 40 days since then. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since the king last visited the temple is 40. Next, we need to calculate the total number of days that the king will spend at the temple based on his usual visiting pattern. As per the question, the king visits the temple every 10 days, and he has already spent 4 days there. So, the total number of days that the king will spend at the temple is 4 + 10 = 14 days. Finally, we need to subtract the number of days that have passed since the king last visited the temple from the total number of days that he will spend at the temple to get the remaining number of days that he will spend there. Subtracting 40 from 14 gives us 36, which is the remaining number of days that the king will spend at the temple.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""សត្វ"" appears in the given text. We can see that the word ""សត្វ"" appears three times in the text. Next, we need to count how many times the word ""ក្បាល"" appears in the text. We can see that the word ""ក្បាល"" appears twice in the text. Finally, we need to add up the number of appearances of both words and divide it by the total number of words in the text to get the average frequency of each word. Based on this calculation, the average frequency of the word ""សត្វ"" is 3/8 = 0.375, and the average frequency of the word ""ក្បាល"" is 2/8 = 0.25. Therefore, the answer is 0.375 for the first part of the question and 0.25 for the second part."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""សត្វ"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After finding out the number of appearances of ""សត្វ"", we need to divide it by the total number of words in the text to get the average frequency of the word ""សត្វ"".  Finally, we multiply the result by 100 to convert it into percentage. So, the answer is:  (Number of appearances of ""សត្វ"") / (Total number of words) x 100 = _______________%."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""សត្វ"" appears in the text. We can see that it appears three times in total. Next, we need to count how many times the word ""ស្លាប"" appears. It appears twice in the text. Finally, we add up all these counts and get our answer of 5. Therefore, there are 5 occurrences of the words ""សត្វស្លាប"" in the given text."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""សត្វ"" appears in the given text. We can see that the word ""សត្វ"" appears twice in the text. Therefore, the answer is 2."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""សត្វ"" appears in the given text. We can see that the word ""សត្វ"" appears three times in the text. Next, we need to count how many times the word ""ស្លាប"" appears. We can see that the word ""ស្លាប"" appears four times in the text. Therefore, the total number of occurrences of both words combined is 3 + 4 = 7. So, there are seven instances of the combination of the two words in the given text."
"Response:  Firstly, there are four options for the first blank: A, B, C, and D. Each of these options has two possible answers for the second blank (A, B, C, or D). Therefore, we have a total of 4 x 2 = 8 possibilities for the answer. However, none of them is correct because they all contain errors in their reasoning. For example, option A states that ""the king"" is the one who makes decisions without consulting anyone else, which is not true since the king does not make any decisions alone but rather with the advice of his councilors and other officials. Similarly, option B claims that ""no one"" can make decisions without consulting others, which is also incorrect since even ordinary people often need to consult with others before making important decisions. Options C and D do not provide accurate information about how decisions are made in Cambodia either. In conclusion, none of the eight possible answers is correct, so the answer is None of the above."

"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group.  There are 4 groups of people in total:  Group A has 3 people, Group B has 5 people, Group C has 2 people, and Group D has 7 people.  Therefore, the total number of people in all groups is: 3 + 5 + 2 + 7 = 17 people.  Next, we need to calculate the average age of each group. The ages of the people in each group are as follows:  Group A: 25 years old, Group B: 30 years old, Group C: 28 years old, and Group D: 35 years old.  To calculate the average age of each group, we divide the age of each person by the number of people in that group:  For Group A, the average age is (25 / 3) = 8.33 years old; for Group B, the average age is (30 / 5) = 6 years old; for Group C, the average age is (28 / 2) = 14 years old; and for Group D, the average age is (35 / 7) = 5 years old.  Finally, we add up all the averages to get the overall average age of all the people: 8.33 + 6 + 14 + 5 = 33 years old."
Response:  We have two rows of teeth with 12 teeth each (for a total of 24 teeth).  Each tooth has a crown that is either gold or porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM). So there are 24 crowns in total. Therefore, the number of fillings needed for this person is 24 / 3 = 8.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many pairs of socks are there in total. We know that there are 20 pairs of socks in total, and each pair contains two socks. Therefore, the number of individual socks is:  Number of pairs = Total number of socks / Number of pairs per set = 20 / 2 = 10 So, there are 10 individual socks in total.
Response:  We know that there are two types of questions in this section: 1) How many and 2) What is the number/ quantity. Based on the question provided, we can identify that it belongs to the first type (How many). So, the correct answer is:  There are 8 roads leading to Phnom Penh.
Response:  We know that there are two types of questions in this section: 1) How many and 2) Counting or quantifying.  In this case, we have to count how many times a certain word appears in a given text. So, the type of question is (2) Counting or quantifying. Therefore, the answer is: 36
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many types of questions are there in total. There are three parts in the question: 1) How many types of questions are there? 2) How many questions are there for each type? and 3) What is the average number of questions per type? So, the total number of questions = 3 x (number of types + number of questions per type). Therefore, the total number of questions = 3 x (3 + 4) = 3 x 7 = 21 questions.
Response:  We know that there are 91 houses in total and we want to find out how many of them have at least one dog. So, let's count the number of houses with dogs. According to the passage, there are 23 houses with at least one dog, so the answer is 23/91 = 0.25 or 25%.
Response:  The first sentence of the question states that there are three types of people who have been to Phnom Penh: those who have been once, twice, and thrice.  Therefore, we can conclude that each type has a different number of times they have visited Phnom Penh.  For the first category (those who have been once), we know that they have only visited Phnom Penh once, so their number is 1.  For the second category (those who have been twice), we know that they have visited Phnom Penh twice, so their number is 2.  And for the third category (those who have been thrice), we know that they have visited Phnom Penh three times, so their number is 3.  Therefore, the total number of people who have been to Phnom Penh is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three types of questions in this passage:  (A) How many... have you had? (B) How many... do you have? and (C) How many... did you have?  Now, let's analyze each type of question separately:  Type A: How many times have you eaten at McDonald's? = 53 times  Type B: How many restaurants do you have near your house? = 75 restaurants  Type C: How many times did you eat at KFC? = 21 times  Therefore, the total number of times the speaker has eaten at any fast food restaurant is: 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 times.

Response:  We have two groups of numbers: 2 and 3.  For each group, we need to find out how many times their sum is equal to 10.  So, for Group 1 (2), the number of times their sum is equal to 10 is 2 x 2 = 4.  And for Group 2 (3), the number of times their sum is equal to 10 is 3 x 3 = 9.  Therefore, there are 4 + 9 = 13 times when the sum of two or three numbers is equal to 10.
Response:  We have two rows of blocks with 3 columns each. In total, there are 8 blocks in both rows. So, we can say that the number of blocks is 8 x 2 = 16. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  The first sentence states that there are two people who have been accused of stealing money from their respective companies.  Therefore, we can assume that each person has stolen $100 (since it is mentioned that they have been accused of stealing money).  So, in total, there are $200 worth of stolen money.
Response:  The first sentence states that there are 20 people in total, and they are divided into two groups of 10 each.  Therefore, the number of people who will be left behind is 10 (the difference between the total number of people and the number of people who went to the mountain).  Now, let's consider the second sentence. It says that among the 10 people who went to the mountain, 5 were able to climb it successfully. So, the number of people who failed to climb the mountain is 5.  Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of people who succeeded in climbing the mountain out of the total number of people who attempted to do so. To do this, we divide the number of successful climbers (5) by the total number of people who tried to climb the mountain (10), which gives us a percentage of 50%.
Response:  Firstly, there are 16 people in total.  Among them, 4 people have not been vaccinated yet. So, the number of people who have been vaccinated is 16 - 4 = 12.  Therefore, the answer is 12.
"Response:  If there are 80 students in total and 40 of them passed the exam, then the number of students who did not pass the exam is:

Number of students who did not pass the exam = Total number of students - Number of students who passed the exam
= 80 - 40
= 40

So, there were 40 students who did not pass the exam."

In Battle 2, there were 40 Cambodian soldiers who died.  And in Battle 3, there were 50 Cambodian soldiers who died.  Therefore, the total number of Cambodian soldiers who died in all three battles is:  30 + 40 + 50 = 120.
Response:  We have four options for the number of people who passed their exams:  Option A: 40 people passed their exams.  Option B: 38 people passed their exams.  Option C: 36 people passed their exams.  And Option D: 34 people passed their exams. Now let's analyze each option based on the information given in the question: Option A: 40 people passed their exams. According to the question, there are 40 people who passed their exams. So, this is the correct answer. Option B: 38 people passed their exams. According to the question, there are 38 people who passed their exams. However, this is not the correct answer as there are only 40 people in total, and 40 - 38 = 2 people who did not pass their exams. Option C: 36 people passed their exams. According to the question, there are 36 people who passed their exams. However, this is not the correct answer as there are only 40 people in total, and 40 - 36 = 4 people who did not pass their exams. Option D: 34 people passed their exams. According to the question, there are 34 people who passed their exams. However, this is not the correct answer as there are only 40 people in total, and 40 - 34 = 6 people who did not pass their exams. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 40 people passed their exams.
Response:  We have to find out how many students passed and failed in each group separately.  For Group A, there are 53 students who passed, so we can write this as A = 53.  For Group B, there are 48 students who passed, so we can write this as B = 48.  For Group C, there are 49 students who passed, so we can write this as C = 49.  Now, let's compare the number of passing students between groups: A > B (53 > 48) and A > C (53 > 49). Therefore, the answer is (A > B) AND (A > C).
Response:  Firstly, there are 34 students in total.  Secondly, they have to take a test for 10 questions. Thirdly, each student has to answer 5 questions correctly to pass the test. Fourthly, if all 34 students pass the test, then 34 x 5 = 170 questions will be answered correctly in total. Fifthly, if only 20 students out of 34 pass the test, then 20 x 5 = 100 questions will be answered correctly in total. Sixthly, if only 10 students out of 34 pass the test, then 10 x 5 = 50 questions will be answered correctly in total. Seventhly, if none of the students pass the test, then 0 x 5 = 0 questions will be answered correctly in total. Therefore, based on the given information, the answer is (D) 170 questions.
Response:  We have 18 students in total, and we want to divide them into groups of 4.  So, how many different ways can we group these 18 students?  There are 4! = 24 possible ways to group 4 students.  Therefore, there are 24 x 4 = 96 different ways to group 18 students into groups of 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 students in total, and they have to divide into two groups of 14 each.  So, the number of students who will be left out is 28 - (14 + 14) = 6.  Now, let's consider the second part of the question. There are 30 students in total, and they have to divide into three groups of 10 each.  So, the number of students who will be left out is 30 - (10 + 10 + 10) = 0. Therefore, none of the students will be left out.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people are in each group.  There are 4 people in Group A and 5 people in Group B.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of people who can meet at the same time.  For Group A, there are 4 people, so there can be up to 4 pairs of people meeting at the same time.  For Group B, there are 5 people, so there can be up to 5 pairs of people meeting at the same time.  Finally, we need to determine which pair of people from each group will meet at the same time.  Based on the information provided, it is clear that Pair 1 (A1 and B2) will meet at the same time as Pair 3 (A3 and B4).
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: January 10, 2023  Date of the second event: February 25, 2023  Subtracting these two dates gives us: 25 - 10 = 15 days So, there are 15 days between the two events.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has kicked the ball 4 times and scored 1 goal. So far so good! However, the next part of the question is a bit tricky - ""How many chances did she have to score?"" Well, if we assume that each kick of the ball gives her one chance to score (which might not be entirely accurate but it'll do for our purposes here), then we can calculate the total number of chances she had as follows:  Chance = Kick x Goal  In this case, Rachel kicked the ball 4 times and scored 1 goal, so her total number of chances would be:  Chance = 4 x 1 = 4  Therefore, Rachel had 4 chances to score in total."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel has 4 teeth missing.  If she brushes her teeth for 3 minutes, how many times will she brush her teeth in total?  Therefore, the answer is 4 x 3 = 12 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has kicked the ball 8 times and scored 4 goals.  Therefore, her shooting percentage is (4/8) x 100 = 50%.  Now, let's calculate the number of chances she had to score a goal. We are given that there were 3 chances for each player in total. So, Rachel had 3 chances to score a goal. Since she scored 4 goals, her conversion rate is (4/3) x 100 = 67%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has kicked the ball to her friend who is standing near the goalpost.  Then, we are asked if Rachel's friend can score a goal from there.  Based on the given information, it seems unlikely that Rachel's friend will be able to score a goal directly from where she received the kick because the distance between them and the goalpost is quite far.  Therefore, I would give an answer of 4 (unlikely).
Response:  According to the question, Rachel has kicked 6 balls into the goal in total.  Of those, she scored 2 goals with her left foot and 4 goals with her right foot. So, the number of goals Rachel scored with each foot is:  Left foot: 2 Right foot: 4 Therefore, the answer is: 2 + 4 = 6
Response:  According to the question, Rachel has kicked 3 balls into the goalpost 2 times, resulting in 6 points. Then, she has missed 27 shots, which means she has scored 0 points for those misses. Therefore, her total score is 6 + 0 = 6 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has kicked the ball 3 times and scored 1 goal. So, her score is 3 + 1 = 4 goals.  Now, let's consider the situation where she kicks the ball again and scores another goal. Her new score will be 4 + 1 = 5 goals. Therefore, the answer to the question is 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has two dogs and she named them Dog1 and Dog2. Then, she fed them food for four days, which means each dog got food for two days. So, the total number of days that Rachel fed her dogs is 4 + 2 = 6 days. Next, we are asked how many bones Rachel gave to her dogs in total. Since she gave one bone per day, the total number of bones Rachel gave to her dogs is 6 (days) x 1 (bone/day) = 6 bones. Finally, we are told that Rachel had three cats, and each cat got one treat per day. Therefore, the total number of treats given to all three cats is 3 (cats) x 1 (treat/cat/day) = 3 treats.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has 32 pairs of shoes and she wants to give some away as gifts.  Secondly, we are asked how many pairs of shoes she will have left after giving some away. Finally, we are told that she will have 16 pairs of shoes left. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has 3 dogs and she wants to sell them.  Secondly, each dog costs $500, so altogether they cost $1500. Thirdly, Rachel has already sold 2 dogs, leaving her with 3 dogs left to sell. Fourthly, if she sells all of her remaining dogs, she will make $800 in total ($3 x $500). Fifthly, after subtracting the amount she has already made from selling two dogs ( $800 - $400 = $400), she will have $400 left over. Therefore, the answer is $400.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel has been given 40 stamps and she wants to send them to her friend who lives far away. The distance between their houses is 8 miles. To calculate how many envelopes Rachel needs to send each stamp, we need to divide the number of stamps by the distance between their houses: Number of envelopes = Number of stamps / Distance between houses = 40 / 8 = 5 So, Rachel needs 5 envelopes to send all 40 stamps to her friend.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 students in total and they have to share their lunch boxes equally among themselves. So, we need to divide 18 into a number that will give each student an equal amount of food. Let's assume that each student gets x pieces of food. Since there are 30 lunch boxes, we can write the equation as follows:

x + (29 - x) = 30

Now, let's solve for x using substitution method. Substituting x = 18 gives us:

18 + (29 - 18) = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10 = 12

So, each student gets 12 pieces of food. Therefore, Doug got 12 pieces of food."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""គ្រាប់"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After counting, we will get 10 instances of the word ""គ្រាប់"".  Next, we need to find out how many times the word ""សិក្សា"" appears in the text. Again, we can count the number of occurrences of that word and get 5 instances.  Finally, we need to multiply the number of instances of each word to get the total number of words in the text. So, the total number of words in the text is 10 x 5 = 50 words. Therefore, the answer to the question is 50."
"Response:  We are given that there are 22 houses in the village and each house has 5 members. So, the total number of people living in the village is:

$$ \text {Total number of people} = \text{Number of houses} \times \text{Number of members per house} $$
= $22$ houses $\times$ $5$ members/house
= $110$ people

Therefore, there are $110$ people living in the village."
Response:  We are given that there are 36 bags of rice and each bag contains 50 kg of rice. So, in total, we have 36 x 50 = 1800 kg of rice. Now, we are asked how many bags of rice can be filled with 27 kg of rice. To find out, we divide the weight of rice that can be filled (27 kg) by the weight of one bag of rice (50 kg): 27 / 50 = 0.54 bags. Therefore, approximately 0.54 bags of rice can be filled with 27 kg of rice.
Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour. So, we can calculate the number of seconds in a day as follows:  There are 86,400 seconds in a day (24 x 60). Now, let's consider how many times the person has been to school since they were born. According to the question, the person has been to school for 14 years, which means they have attended school for 14 x 365 = 4,970 days. Finally, we divide the total number of seconds in a day by the number of days the person has attended school to get the approximate number of seconds the person has spent at school:  Therefore, the person has spent approximately 4,970 x 86,400 = 406,560,000 seconds at school since birth.
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in February (the month with the most days). So, if we multiply 28 by 17, we get 460 days. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since the last time the full moon occurred is 460 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 questions in total.  Secondly, each question has 4 options for answers. Therefore, the total number of possible answers is 18 x 4 = 72. Finally, we need to find out how many of these answers correspond to the correct answer (which is option A). So, the probability of getting the correct answer is 72 / 180 = 0.39.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 days in April and May combined (April has 30 days and May has 31 days). So, if we subtract the number of days in May from the total number of days in April and May, we will get the number of days left after May ends. Therefore, the answer is:

$$ \text{Number of days left after May ends} = \text{Total number of days in April and May} - \text{Number of days in May} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Number of days left after May ends} &= 30 + 31 \\ &= 61 \end{aligned} $$

So, there are 61 days left after May ends."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 questions in total.  Therefore, the number of correct answers is 20.  Now, let's count how many times each letter appears in the questions:

* The letter ""a"" appears 4 times.
* The letter ""e"" appears 3 times.
* The letter ""i"" appears 2 times.
* The letter ""o"" appears 3 times.
* The letter ""u"" appears once.

So, the total number of letters in the questions is 15 (4+3+2+3+1).  Therefore, the probability of selecting a letter at random from the questions is 1/15."

Response:  We know that there are 48 students in total who passed the exam and got into university. Among them, 30 students were able to get scholarships. So, the number of students who did not receive scholarships is: $48 - 30 = 18$ students. Therefore, the answer is $18$.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that Sofia spent in Bulgaria. According to the question, she stayed for 30 nights. Therefore, the total number of days is: 30 nights x 24 hours/night = 720 hours. Now, let's convert it to days: 720 hours / 8 hours/day = 90 days. So, Sofia spent 90 days in Bulgaria.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since Sofia was born. Based on the information provided in the question, Sofia was born on January 15th, 2008. As of today (January 14th, 2023), it has been 15 years since her birthday. Therefore, the answer is: 15 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 people in total who have been invited to the party - Sofia, Srey, Hakim, and Yara.  Secondly, we know that only 3 of them will be able to attend the party because one person (Sofia) has already cancelled their attendance. Therefore, the number of people who can attend the party is 3. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are willing to donate blood. According to the question, there are 182 people who have registered to donate blood.  Next, we need to calculate the number of times each person can donate blood in one year. Based on the information provided, each person can donate blood up to three times per year. Therefore, the total number of times the 182 people can donate blood is 3 x 182 = 546. So, the answer is 546.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who passed the examination. According to the question, out of 324 students, 280 passed the examination, which means that 280/324 = 0.875 or approximately 90% of the students passed the examination. Therefore, the answer is (A) 90%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in Bulgaria as of today (January 20, 2023). According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Bulgaria has administered 867,547 doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. Now, let's assume that all these people have received two doses each, which means they are fully vaccinated. Therefore, the total number of fully vaccinated individuals in Bulgaria is:  Number of doses = 867,547 Dose per person = 2 So, the total number of fully vaccinated individuals in Bulgaria is: Fully vaccinated individuals = Number of doses x Dose per person = 867,547 x 2 = 1,735,094 As for the second part of the question, it asks about the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated in Bulgaria. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of fully vaccinated individuals by the total population of Bulgaria. According to the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria, the country's population as of January 1, 2023, was approximately 6.9 million people. Therefore, the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated in Bulgaria is: Percentage of population vaccinated = Fully vaccinated individuals / Total population = 1,735,094 / 6,900,000 = 0.25 or 25%
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of people who have been vaccinated with two doses each. According to the information provided in the question, a total of 144 people have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, the number of people who have been vaccinated with two doses each is:  144 x 2 = 288 people.  Next, we need to calculate the number of people who have not been vaccinated yet. Based on the information provided in the question, there are 356 people who have not been vaccinated yet. Therefore, the number of people who have not been vaccinated yet is:  356 people.  So, the final answer is:  288 + 356 = 644 people.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who passed the examination and got their diplomas. According to the information provided in the question, there are 28 students who have passed the examination and received their diplomas. Therefore, the answer is 28.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who passed the examination. According to the question, out of 40 students, 32 students passed the examination, so the number of passing students is 32.  Next, we need to find out how many students did not pass the examination. From the question, it is mentioned that 8 students failed the examination, so the number of non-passing students is 8. Therefore, the total number of students who took the examination is 40, and the number of passing students is 32, while the number of non-passing students is 8.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 people in the group who went to Sofia and returned home.  Among them, 3 people were sick with COVID-19 and had to be hospitalized.  Therefore, the number of people who did not get sick is: $28 - 3 = 25$ people.  So, the percentage of people who did not get sick is: $\frac{25}{28} \times 100\% = 87.5\%$.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who passed the examination and received their certificates. According to the question, there are 280 students in total, including those who passed and failed the examination. Therefore, the number of students who passed the examination is:

Number of students who passed = Total number of students - Number of students who failed
= 280 - 36
= 244

Next, we need to calculate the number of students who did not pass the examination. According to the question, there are 36 students who failed the examination. Therefore, the number of students who did not pass the examination is:

Number of students who did not pass = Total number of students - Number of students who passed
= 280 - 244
= 36

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of students who passed the examination out of the total number of students. To do this, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

Percentage of students who passed = (Number of students who passed / Total number of students) x 100
= (244 / 280) x 100
= 85%

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, the answer to the question is 85%."
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, we can calculate the number of hours as follows:  Number of hours = Total number of days x Number of hours per day  Therefore, the total number of hours in a year is:  Total number of hours = 365 days x 24 hours/day = 8,760 hours/year Now, let's find out how many hours are left after subtracting the number of hours spent sleeping from the total number of hours in a year. To do this, we need to know how many hours a person spends sleeping per night and per year. According to various sources, an average adult sleeps for about 7-9 hours per night, which translates to around 2,592-3,168 hours per year (assuming 8 hours of sleep per night). So, if someone sleeps for 8 hours per night, they will spend approximately 2,592 hours sleeping per year. If we now subtract this amount from the total number of hours in a year, we get:  Remaining hours = Total number of hours - Sleeping hours  Therefore, the remaining hours in a year would be:  Remaining hours = 8,760 hours - 2,592 hours = 6,168 hours/year Now, let's convert these remaining hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:  Minutes = Hours x 60  Therefore, the total number of minutes in a year would be:  Minutes = 6,168 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 370,640 minutes/year Finally, let's convert these minutes back to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:  Seconds = Minutes x 60  Therefore, the total number of seconds in a year would be:  Seconds = 370,640 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 22,657,600 seconds/year And that's the answer!
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group.  There are 34 people in Group A and 84 people in Group B.  Now, let's calculate the ratio of men to women in each group.  In Group A, there are 17 men (34 x 0.5) and 17 women (34 x 0.5). Similarly, in Group B, there are 62 men (84 x 0.75) and 22 women (84 x 0.25).  Finally, we can calculate the total number of men and women as follows: Total number of men = 62 + 17 = 79 Total number of women = 22 + 17 = 39 Therefore, the ratio of men to women is 79:39 or 2:1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 48 people in total (including both men and women).  Among them, 23 men have beards, which means that 15 men do not have beards (i.e., they are clean-shaven).  Therefore, the number of men with beards is 23.  Next, we know that among the remaining 25 people (women), none of them has a beard, so the number of people with beards among women is also 0.  Finally, since there are 48 people in total, including both men and women, the sum of the numbers of men and women with beards is equal to 48.  Hence, the answer is 23 + 0 = 23.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the group of friends who went to the beach together. According to the question, there were 86 people in total, including both men and women. So, the number of male friends is 43 (86 - 43 =). Therefore, the answer is 43.
Response:  We have two quantities given in the problem: 635 and 510. To find out how many times 635 can be divided into 510, we need to divide both numbers: 635 / 510 = 1.24 (round down to the nearest whole number). Therefore, there are 124 units of the smaller quantity that can fit into each unit of the larger quantity.
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we calculate the number of hours in a year, it will be: 365 x 24 = 8760 hours/year Now, let's convert this number to years: 8760 / 24 = 365 years Therefore, there are approximately 365 years worth of hours in a year.
Response:  We know that there are 100 people in total, including 80 men and 20 women. Now, we need to find out how many of them have children. To do this, we will divide the number of children (which is 30) by the total population (which is 100). So, the proportion of people with children is:  30/100 = 0.3 or 30%. Therefore, about 30% of the people in the group have children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 106 people in the village.  Secondly, we know that 43 of them have cars.  Finally, we know that there are 223 houses in the village.  Therefore, the number of households with at least one car is:  43 x 106 = 4580.
Response:  We have 802 students in total (416 boys and 386 girls). Among them, 357 are from grade 9-12 (183 boys and 174 girls), and 445 are from kindergarten to grade 8 (233 boys and 212 girls). So, the number of male students is 416 + 183 = 599, and the number of female students is 386 + 174 = 560. Therefore, there are 599 - 560 = 39 more male students than female students.
Response:  We have 43 students in total (21 boys and 22 girls). Among them, 7 are from grade 10 (3 boys and 4 girls), 9 are from grade 11 (5 boys and 4 girls), and 27 are from grade 12 (14 boys and 13 girls). So, the number of students who are not from grade 10 is 36 (7 + 9 + 27). Now, among these non-grade 10 students, 18 are boys (14 from grade 12 and 4 from grade 11) and 18 are girls (13 from grade 12 and 5 from grade 11). Therefore, the number of male students who are not from grade 10 is 18, and the number of female students who are not from grade 10 is also 18.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 321 students in the school and they have to take the examination.  Secondly, we know that each student has to sit for 80 questions, which means that the total number of questions is 321 x 80 = 25760. Finally, we know that the school has 36 teachers who will be responsible for checking the answers, which means that the total number of checkers is 36. Therefore, the answer is (321 x 80) + (36) = 25946.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 136 people in the group of friends who went to the beach together.  Secondly, we know that among them, 40 people are men and 96 people are women. Therefore, the number of male friends is 40, and the number of female friends is 96. Finally, we know that there are 214 people in total in the group of friends, including both males and females. So, the number of male friends plus the number of female friends is equal to the total number of people in the group, which is 214. Hence, the answer is (40 + 96) = 136.
Response:  We have 308 people in the group and 218 people outside of it. So, the number of people who are not in the group is:  308 - 218 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 people who are not in the group.
Response:  We have 365 days in a year and we need to find out how many times 316 people can eat dinner together in one year. So, let's divide 316 by 365: 316 / 365 = 0.874 or approximately 9 times. Therefore, there are approximately 9 times when 316 people can eat dinner together in one year.
"Response:  We know that there are 40 students in total and they are divided into groups of 3 or 4. So, we have to find out how many groups can be formed with these 40 students. To do this, we need to divide 40 by 3 or 4 (whichever is applicable).

If we divide 40 by 3, we get 13. So, there can be 13 groups of 3 students each.

If we divide 40 by 4, we also get 10. So, there can be 10 groups of 4 students each.

Therefore, the answer is 13 + 10 = 23 groups."
Response:  We know that there are 48 students in total (Option A). Now, we need to find out how many of them have their own bicycle (Option B). From the given information, we can see that 16 students do not have their own bicycles (Option C), and 20 students have their own bicycles (Option D). Therefore, the number of students who have their own bicycles is 20. So, the answer is Option D: 20.
"Response:  We know that there are 362 people in the village and 257 of them have been infected with COVID-19. So, the number of people who have not been infected is:

Number of people who have not been infected = Total number of people - Number of infected people
= 362 - 257
= 85

Therefore, out of 362 villagers, 85 have not been infected with COVID-19."
Response:  We know that there are 18 balls in total.  If we take 4 balls out of them, then the number of remaining balls is 18 - 4 = 14.  So, the answer is 14.
Response:  We know that there are 10 people in total (5 men and 5 women).  Among them, 3 people have blue eyes, which means that among the men, 2/5 = 0.4 or 40% of them have blue eyes. Similarly, among the women, 3/5 = 0.6 or 60% of them have blue eyes. Therefore, the number of people with blue eyes is:  Number of men with blue eyes = 0.4 x 5 = 2 Men Number of women with blue eyes = 0.6 x 5 = 3 Women So, there are 2 men and 3 women with blue eyes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of people who have been vaccinated is 8000.  Then, we are asked how many people will be vaccinated in total. To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of people who have already been vaccinated (8000) by the number of additional people who will be vaccinated (16). Therefore, the total number of people who will be vaccinated is:  8000 x 16 = 128,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has 16 balls and he wants to divide them equally among 92 people. So, each person will get  $\frac{16}{92} = \boxed{0.175}$ ball. Since there are 6 decimals in total, each person will get $0.175$ balls + $0.006$ balls (which is the remaining amount after dividing $16$ by $92$). Therefore, the final answer is $0.181$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $6 in his pocket and he wants to share it equally among 4 of his friends. So, each friend will get $\frac{6}{4} = \boxed{\$1.5}$. Now, there are 12 people in total including Edward himself, so if he wants to give them all an equal amount, he will have to divide $\boxed{\$1.5}$ among 13 people, which is $\frac{\boxed{\$1.5}}{\boxed{13}} = \$0.12$. Therefore, the amount of money that each person (including Edward) will receive is $\boxed{\$0.12}$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $6 in his pocket and he wants to buy something worth $16. So, he needs to have at least $10 more than what he has in his pocket to buy the thing he wants ($16 - $6 = $10). Therefore, the answer is yes, Edward can afford it.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $4 more than twice as much money as he had before. So, if he had $3 before, then he now has $4 + $3 = $7.  Therefore, the total amount of money Edward has is $7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $10 and he wants to buy something worth $8. So, he will have $2 left after buying the item. Now, let's consider how many items of worth $3 each he can buy with his remaining money of $2. We can calculate this as follows: Number of items = Remaining amount / Cost per item = $2 / $3 = 2 items Therefore, Edward can buy 2 items worth $6 each ($3 x 2).
Response:  We know that the number of balls is 10 and each ball costs $ 8. So, the total cost of all the balls is: $$ \text {Total Cost} = 10 \times 8 = 80 $$ Therefore, the amount of money left after buying all the balls is: $$ \text{Amount Left} = 80 - 64 = 16 $$
Response:  Zachary has 44 friends and he wants to give them all gifts equally. So, we need to divide 44 by the number of gifts he wants to give (which is 14). Therefore, Zachary will have to buy 3 gifts per friend on average. Now, let's check if Zachary can afford it. He has $200 to spend, so we need to divide that amount by the total cost of the gifts he needs to buy ($6 x 3 = $18). Unfortunately, Zachary cannot afford to buy 3 gifts for each of his 44 friends with the money he has.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. So, we can say that Zachary is better than David in terms of push-ups.  Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Zachary is better than David.
Response:  We know that there are 4 days in a week and we have to count how many times Zachary has gone to school during those 4 days. So, let's count it as follows: Day 1: Zachary went to school twice (morning and afternoon). Therefore, he has gone to school once per day. Day 2: Zachary did not go to school because he was sick. Day 3: Zachary went to school again, so he has gone to school once more. Total number of times Zachary has gone to school = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 times.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since Zachary and David started their journey together. According to the question, they started their journey 10 days ago. So, the number of days that have passed is: 10 days + 6 days = 16 days. Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by each person separately. According to the question, Zachary walked for 4 miles per day, while David walked for 3 miles per day. To find out the total distance traveled by both of them, we need to multiply the number of days they walked by their respective walking distances. For Zachary, the total distance traveled is: 4 miles/day x 16 days = 64 miles For David, the total distance traveled is: 3 miles/day x 16 days = 48 miles Finally, we add the total distance traveled by both of them to get the overall distance traveled: 64 miles + 48 miles = 112 miles Therefore, the answer to the question is 112 miles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has done 38 good deeds and David has done 40 good deeds.  Therefore, the difference between their number of good deeds is 2 (David - Zachary).  So, the answer to the question is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has done 41 times of exercise and David has done 30 times of exercise. Therefore, the difference between their number of exercises is 11 (41 - 30).  So, David has exercised for 11 more times than Zachary.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has played 53 games and won 14 of them.  Now, let's calculate the percentage of wins out of total games played.  To do this, we divide the number of wins (14) by the total number of games played (53), which gives us a percentage of 26.4%.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 26.4%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches at the age of 10.  Then, we are asked how many times he repeated this action since then.  To calculate this, we need to subtract his current age from his original age (10). So, if his current age is 12 years old, he has repeated this action for 2 years (12 - 10 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has done 40 push-ups and 38 sit-ups.  Therefore, the total number of exercises he has done is 40 + 38 = 78 exercises.  Now, let's calculate the average number of exercises per day. We know that Zachary has been doing exercise for 15 days, so the total number of exercises he has done in one week is 78 x 7 = 566 exercises.  Finally, to find out how many push-ups and sit-ups Zachary has done overall, we can multiply the total number of exercises he has done by the number of push-ups and sit-ups he did each day. For push-ups, it is 40 / 15 = 2.67 push-ups per day; for sit-ups, it is 38 / 15 = 2.53 sit-ups per day. So, Zachary has done altogether 2.67 x 15 = 40 push-ups and 2.53 x 15 = 39 sit-ups overall."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has been working for 19 years and he is currently at the age of 38 (since he was born in 1984).  Therefore, his age when he started working can be calculated as follows:  Age = Year Started Working - Current Age = 1984 - 1975 = 9 years old.  Now, let's calculate how many hours he worked per day based on the information provided:  Hours Worked Per Day = Total Hours Worked / Number of Years Worked = 10,000 hours / 19 years = approximately 529 hours per year.  Finally, to calculate how much money he earned during those 9 years, we need to multiply the number of hours worked per year by the hourly wage:  Money Earned = Hours Worked Per Year x Hourly Wage = 529 hours/year x $10/hour = approximately $5,290 per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has done 51 tasks in total.  Among them, he helped 4 people (John, David, and two others). So, the number of times Zachary helped someone is 4.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary has been working for 15 days and he has worked with 3 people including himself (Zachary), John, and David.  Therefore, the total number of days Zachary has worked with each person is as follows:  With Zachary = 15 days; With John = 0 days (since John has not worked with Zachary); With David = 0 days (since David has not worked with Zachary).  So, the correct answer is 0."
Response:  We know that there are three people in total - David, Sarah, and Zachary.  Each of them has to take a test for 37 questions. So, we need to calculate the total number of tests taken by all three people. Therefore, the answer is: 3 x 37 = 111 tests taken in total.
"Response:  We know that there are three people in total - David, Zachary and the narrator (who is not mentioned by name).  The question asks how many times each of them has gone to the beach.  So, we can start by listing their names and counting how many times they have gone to the beach:

David: 38 times
Zachary: Not specified (the question does not provide any information about Zachary's trips to the beach)
Narrator: Not applicable (the narrator is not mentioned as having gone to the beach)

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

David: 38 times
Zachary: Not specified
Narrator: Not applicable"
Response:  According to the question, there are four people in total - Zachary, David, and two other people whose names are not mentioned.  We know that Zachary has studied for 34 subjects, and David has studied for 28 subjects. So, the total number of subjects studied by all five people is: 34 + 28 = 62 subjects.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 58 tasks and completed 33 of them. So, we can calculate the number of tasks he has not completed as follows:  Number of tasks not completed = Total number of tasks - Number of completed tasks = 58 - 33 = 25 tasks. Therefore, Zachary has not completed 25 tasks.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 5 tasks and completed 17 tasks. So, we can calculate the total number of tasks he has done as follows: Total tasks = Number of tasks done + Number of tasks completed = 5 + 17 = 22 tasks. Therefore, the answer is 22 tasks.

"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""សិក្សា"" appears in the given text. We can see that it appears 8 times in total. Next, we need to determine how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 4 appears in the text. Using this information, we can calculate the probability of each number appearing in the text. Here are the calculations:  Number of appearances of ""សិក្សា"": 8  Number of times ""សិក្សា"" appears in the text: 8 x 4 = 32  Probability of each number appearing in the text (based on the formula):  P(x) = Number of appearances of x / Total number of appearances of ""សិក្សា""  P(1) = 1/32 = 0.03125 P(2) = 2/32 = 0.0625 P(3) = 3/32 = 0.09375 P(4) = 4/32 = 0.125  Therefore, the probability of each number appearing in the text is as follows:  P(1) = 0.03125  P(2) = 0.0625  P(3) = 0.09375  P(4) = 0.125"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in 30 years. There are 365 days in a year, so there are:

$$ \text{Number of days in 30 years} = 30 \times 365 = 10,950 \days $$

Now, let's calculate the number of weeks in $10,950$ days:

$$ \text{Number of weeks in $10,950$ days} = 10,950 \div 7 = 1,628.57 \text{ weeks} $$

Finally, we can convert the number of weeks to months:

$$ \text{Number of months in $1628.57$ weeks} = 1628.57 \div 4.33 = 373.33 \text{ months} $$

So, there are approximately $373.33$ months in $30$ years."

$$ \text{Total number of options} = \sum_{i=1}^6 \times \text{Number of options in subject } i $$

Now, let's calculate the sum:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of options} &= 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 \\ &= 17 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, there are 17 options available for the six subjects combined."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of years that Rachel has been working as an accountant. According to the question, she started working in this field 10 years ago, so now it is 2023 (assuming she started working at the age of 25). Therefore, Rachel has been working as an accountant for 10 + 13 = 23 years.  Next, let's calculate the total number of hours she has worked as an accountant during these 23 years. Assuming she works 40 hours per week and takes 2 weeks off every year (which is a reasonable assumption), then she has worked a total of 40 x 52 = 2080 hours per year. Multiplying this by the number of years she has worked as an accountant gives us a total of 2080 x 23 = 47960 hours. Finally, dividing this number by the number of days in a year (365) gives us the approximate number of days Rachel has spent working as an accountant: 47960 / 365 ≈ 13150 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""Rachel"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each word in the text using the following formula:

Number of occurrences = Total number of words - Number of unique words

In this case, there are 10 words in the text:

1. Rachel
2. ត្រូវ
3. ធ្វើការ
4. វិភាគ
5. គណិត
6. វិទ្យា
7. និង
8. ១០
9. ទំព័រ
10. សិក្សាវិទ្យា

Therefore, the total number of words is 10. Now, let's count the number of unique words in the text:

Unique words = Number of distinct words - Duplicate words

In this case, there are 5 unique words in the text:

1. Rachel
2. ត្រូវ
3. ធ្វើការ
4. វិភាគ
5. គណិត

Now, let's calculate the number of occurrences of each unique word in the text:

Occurrences of Rachel = 3 (It appears three times in the text)
Occurrences of ត្រូវ = 1 (It appears once in the text)
Occurrences of ធ្វើការ = 1 (It appears once in the text)
Occurrences of វិភាគ = 1 (It appears once in the text)
Occurrences of គ�"
"Response:  The question asks about the number of times the word "" Cambodia"" appears in the text.  We know that there are 9 paragraphs and each paragraph has an average of 10 words. Therefore, we can estimate the total number of words in all 9 paragraphs as follows:

Number of words = Number of paragraphs x Average number of words per paragraph
= 9 x 10
= 90

Now, let's count how many times the word ""Cambodia"" appears in these 90 words:

Word ""Cambodia"": 5 appearances
Word ""Khmer"": 3 appearances
Word ""Rachel"": 2 appearances
Other words (e.g., ""the"", ""a"", etc.): 7 appearances

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Number of times the word ""Cambodia"" appears = 5

Note: This calculation is just for fun and does not reflect the actual frequency of the word ""Cambodia"" in the given text."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of years that Rachel has been working as an accountant. According to the question, she started working in this field in 2015 and has been doing so for 7 years now (in 2022). Therefore, the answer is:   Years = 2022 - 2015 = 7 years.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""ត្រូ"" appears in the text. We can see that it appears twice in the first sentence and once in the second sentence, so the total number of appearances is 3. Next, we need to count how many times ""ធ្វើ"" appears in the text. It appears once in each of the two sentences, so the total number of appearances is also 2. Then, we need to count how many times ""ការវិភាគគណិតវិទ្យា"" appears in the text. We can see that it appears once in each of the two sentences, so the total number of appearances is also 2. Finally, we need to add up all these numbers to get the total number of words that appear at least once in both sentences: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 words that appear at least once in both sentences."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times "" Cambodia"" appears in the text. We can see that it appears three times: once in the phrase ""Cambodia has been facing"", once in the phrase ""Cambodia is still facing"", and once in the phrase ""Cambodia will continue to face"". Therefore, the answer is 3."

So, the most likely answer is Combination 2: Option A and Option C, which has a probability of 2/6."
Response:  If Jack has been working for 6 months and he has worked for 2 hours per day, then he has worked a total of:  6 months x 2 hours/day = 120 days   So, in total, Jack has worked for 120 days.
Response:  If Jack has been working for 6 months and his salary is $1000 per month, then he has earned $6000 ($1000 x 6) in total during those 6 months.  Now, if we add another 2 months to that time period (i.e., from 6 months to 8 months), Jack would have worked for a total of 8 months. So, his total earnings during this additional 2-month period would be $12000 ($1000 x 8). Therefore, Jack's total earnings over the entire period of 8 months would be $18000 ($6000 + $12000).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been working at the company for 4 years and 8 months (4.5 years). Secondly, he has taken 10 days of leave in total during this period, which is equivalent to 0.23% of his total work time (4.5 years x 10 days / 1 year = 0.23%). Lastly, we are asked how many hours of leave Jack has taken per week on average. To calculate this, we divide the total number of days of leave taken by the number of weeks worked during the same period. Therefore, the answer is:  Jack has taken approximately 17.6 hours of leave per week on average over the past 4.5 years.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack has been working for 4 years and 3 months at his current job. He earns $50,000 per year, which is equivalent to $4,167 per month. Therefore, he has earned a total of:

$4,167 x 48 months = $200,000

So, Jack has earned a total of $200,000 in 4 years and 3 months."
Response:  In the first period ( Period 1), Jack had 3 apples and gave 2 to his friend. So, he has 3 - 2 = 1 apple left.  In the second period (Period 2), Jack had 0 apple because he gave all of them away. So, he doesn't have any apple in this period.  In the third period (Period 3), Jack received 5 apples as a gift from his friend. So, he now has 5 + 1 = 6 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been to Cambodia four times (4). Secondly, each time he visited Cambodia, he spent an average of $100 per day ($100/day). Therefore, the total amount of money Jack spent in Cambodia is: $$ Total = 4 \times $100/day = $400$$ So, Jack spent $400 in Cambodia.
Response:  If Jack has 3 apples in his bag and he gives 2 to his friend, then he will have 3 - 2 = 1 apple left in his bag.  Now, if he goes to the market and buys 5 more apples, he will have 1 + 5 = 6 apples in his bag.  Finally, if he gives 3 of those apples to his brother, he will be left with 6 - 3 = 3 apples in his bag. Therefore, the answer is 3 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been to Cambodia 10 times and Vietnam 3 times.  Therefore, the total number of countries he has visited is 10 + 3 = 13.  Now, let's calculate the number of days he spent in each country.  In Cambodia, he stayed for 2 weeks, which means he spent 14 days (2 weeks x 7 days/week).  In Vietnam, he stayed for 1 week, which means he spent 7 days (1 week x 7 days/week).  So, the total number of days Jack spent traveling is 14 + 7 = 21 days.
Response:  If Jack has 8 balls and he gives 4 of them to his friend, then he will have 8 - 4 = 4 balls left.  Now, if he gives another 2 balls to his other friend, he will have 4 - 2 = 2 balls left. Therefore, Jack has given away a total of 4 + 2 = 6 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been to Cambodia for 10 days and Vietnam for 5 days.  Therefore, he has spent a total of 15 days abroad (10 + 5 = 15).  Now, let's calculate how many hours he has spent in each country.  In Cambodia, he spent 10 days x 24 hours/day = 240 hours.  In Vietnam, he spent 5 days x 24 hours/day = 120 hours.  So, altogether, Jack has spent 360 hours abroad (240 + 120 = 360).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been working at his current job for 4 years (Year 1). In Year 2, he got promoted to Manager and received an additional $5000 salary increase. Then in Year 3, he was transferred to another department with a 10% pay cut. So his monthly salary decreased by $500. Finally, in Year 4, he received a bonus of $2000 which is equivalent to 10% of his annual salary. Therefore, his total income from all sources including bonuses can be calculated as follows:  Total income = Monthly salary + Bonus  Total income = ($6000 x 12) + $2000 = $72,000 per year  Based on this calculation, Jack's total income over the past 4 years can be estimated as follows:  Total income (Year 1) = $6000 x 12 = $72,000  Total income (Year 2) = $6000 x 12 + $5000 = $84,000  Total income (Year 3) = $6000 x 12 - $500 = $73,500  Total income (Year 4) = $72,000 + $2000 = $74,000  Therefore, Jack's total income over the past 4 years can be estimated to be approximately $292,500.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 3 pairs of socks and 64 socks in total.  Therefore, the number of socks he has is:

3 (pairs) x 64 (socks/pair) = 192

Now, let's calculate the number of socks he has worn out of these 192 socks:

If he has worn out 5 socks, then the remaining socks are:

192 - 5 = 187

So, Jack has worn out 5 socks."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been working for 5 years (5 និង). Then, he took a break of 2 years (2 និង), so his total work experience is 7 years (7 និង). Now, let's calculate how many months he has worked continuously: 7 years x 12 months/year = 84 months (84 និង)  Therefore, Jack has worked continuously for 84 months.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since Jack started his job. We know that he has been working for 10 years and 2 months, so the total number of days is:  10 years x 365 days/year = 3,650 days + 2 months x 30 days/month = 60 days = 3,710 days  Now, let's calculate the number of hours Jack has worked in those 3,710 days:  3,710 days x 8 hours/day = 29,440 hours  Finally, let's convert the number of hours into minutes:  29,440 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1,728,800 minutes  So, Jack has worked for 1,728,800 minutes since he started his job.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been working for 4 years and 3 months (4 + 3 = 7).  Secondly, he has taken 2 days off in total (not including today). Therefore, the number of working days until his next birthday is: 7 - 2 = 5. So, Jack will have 5 working days left before his next birthday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 6 cards in his hand and he discards 2 cards to get 4 new cards. So, the number of cards he has now is 6 - 2 = 4.  Next, we are asked how many cards Jack has after shuffling the deck again. Since the deck contains 91 cards, and Jack shuffles it twice, the number of cards he gets each time is 91 / 2 = 45-50 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards Jack has after shuffling the deck twice is 4 + (45-50) = 89 cards.
Response:  According to the question, Jack has been working for 4 years and has produced 20 products. So, he has worked for an average of 5 years (20/4 = 5). Now, let's calculate how many days he has worked in total. There are 365 days in a year, so we can multiply the number of years by the number of days to get the total number of days worked: 5 x 365 = 1825 days. Therefore, Jack has worked for 1825 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been working at the company for 8 years ( Cambodian time : បានទទួលអេឡិចត្រូនិចសរុបចំនួន ៩ ក្នុងមួយថ្ងៃ ).  Secondly, we are asked how many days Jack has worked in total ( បើសិនជាគាត់ទទួលបានអ៊ីម៉ែល ៧ នៅព្រឹក និងបន្តិចទៀតនៅល្ងាច តើលោក Jack ទទួលបានអ៊ីម៉ែលប៉ុន្មាននៅល្ងាចនោះ?). Therefore, the answer is 8 x 30 = 240 days.
Response:  If Jack has $3 in his pocket and he spends $2 on a toy, then he will have $1 left.  If he spends another $4 on a book, then he will have $0 left. Therefore, the answer is $0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has been working for 3 years and 6 months at his current job. Therefore, he has worked for a total of 3 + 6 = 9 years and 6 months.  Next, we are asked how many times Jack has received a salary increase during this period. We can see from the given information that Jack received his first salary increase after working for 2 years and 6 months, which is equivalent to 2 + 6 = 8 years ago. So, Jack has received one salary increase every 8 years on average.  Finally, we are asked how much money Jack has earned in total since he started working. Based on the fact that he receives an average salary increase every 8 years, we can calculate the total amount of money Jack has earned as follows: Total amount of money Jack has earned = Number of salary increases x Average salary increase per year x Number of years between each salary increase In this case, the number of salary increases is equal to 1 (since Jack has only received one salary increase so far), the average salary increase per year is $5000 (based on the information provided), and the number of years between each salary increase is equal to 8 years (as mentioned earlier). Therefore, the total amount of money Jack has earned since he started working can be calculated as follows: Total amount of money Jack has earned = $5000 x 1 x 8 = $40,000 This means that Jack has earned a total of $40,000 since he started working.
Response:  Firstly, we know that សត្វ (S) is equal to 8 and ស្លាប (L) is equal to 50. Therefore, សត្វស្លាប (SL) is equal to 8 + 50 = 58. Now, let's calculate the number of times សត្វ (S) appears in សត្វស្លាប (SL): 8 x 58 = 468. Finally, let's calculate the number of times ស្លាប (L) appears in សត្វស្លាប (SL): 50 x 58 = 2900. So, the answer is 468 for សត្វ (S) and 2900 for ស្លាប (L).
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since Sreyashi started her job at the company. According to the question, she has been working there for 31 days. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since she started her job is 31. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has earned so far. Based on the information provided in the question, Sreyashi has earned $35 per day. Therefore, the total amount of money she has earned so far is $35 x 31 = $1095. So, the answer to the question is $1095.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of years that Srey has been working as a teacher. According to the question, she started working in 2015 and has been working for 7 years now (in 2022). Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{7} $ years.  Next, we need to calculate the number of days that Srey has worked as a teacher since she started her job. We know that there are $ \boxed{365} $ days in a year, so we can multiply the number of years by the number of days to get the total number of days that Srey has worked as a teacher: $ \boxed{7} \times \boxed{365} = \boxed{2,595} $ days.  Finally, we need to convert the number of days into months. There are $ \boxed{30} $ days in each month, so we can divide the total number of days by the number of days in a month to get the total number of months that Srey has worked as a teacher: $ \boxed{2,595} \div \boxed{30} = \boxed{86} $ months.  Therefore, the answer to the question is: $ \boxed{7} $ years, $ \boxed{86} $ months, or approximately $ \boxed{8.6} $ years and $ \boxed{945} $ days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of boys in the class. According to the question, there are 26 students in total, and 14 of them are boys. Therefore, the number of boys in the class is 14/26 = 0.538 (approximately). Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the class. According to the question, there are 12 girls in the class. Finally, we need to determine whether the ratio of boys to girls in the class is greater than or equal to 2. Based on our calculation above, the ratio of boys to girls in the class is approximately 0.538:1. Since this value is less than 2, the answer is no.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. According to the question, the incident happened on March 20th, so it has been 19 days since then.  Next, we need to determine how many people were injured in the incident. The question states that 37 people were injured, and we need to convert this number into days. To do this, we divide the number of people injured by the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. In this case, we get 37 / 19 = 1.84 years. Therefore, there are approximately 1.84 years worth of injuries.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st) until the day when the person was born (March 20th). We can do this by subtracting March 20th from January 1st: 365 - 19 = 346 days.  Next, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the person's birthday (March 20th) until today (April 17th). We can do this by subtracting April 17th from March 20th: 346 - 17 = 329 days. Therefore, the answer is 329 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of years that Srey has been working as a teacher. According to the question, she started working as a teacher in 2015 and has been doing so for 7 years now (in 2022). Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{7} $. Next, we need to calculate the number of years that Kem has been working as an engineer. Based on the question, he started working as an engineer in 2010 and has been doing so for 12 years now (in 2022). Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{12} $. Finally, we need to calculate the total number of years that both Srey and Kem have worked together as colleagues at the same company. To do this, we simply add the number of years they have been working as teachers and engineers respectively. Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{7 + 12 = 19} $. So, the answer to the question is $ \boxed{19} $.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of boys who passed the examination. According to the question, out of 20 boys, 5 passed the examination, so the number of boys who passed is 5/20 = 0.25.  Next, we need to calculate the number of girls who passed the examination. According to the question, out of 18 girls, 9 passed the examination, so the number of girls who passed is 9/18 = 0.5.  Finally, we add the number of boys and girls who passed the examination to get the total number of students who passed. Therefore, the total number of students who passed the examination is 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times ""សត្វ"" appears in the given text. We can see that ""សត្វ"" appears three times in the text. Next, we need to count how many times ""ស្លាប"" appears. We can observe that ""ស្លាប"" appears twice in the text. Therefore, the total number of occurrences of both words is 3 + 2 = 5. Finally, we need to divide the total number of occurrences of both words by the number of letters in each word. In this case, the length of ""សត្វ"" is 4 letters and the length of ""ស្លាប"" is also 4 letters. So, the ratio of occurrence of both words is 5 / (4 + 4) = 5/8."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days that Srey has been in school. According to the question, she started school at age 6 and graduated at age 18, which means she spent 12 years in school (from age 6 to age 18). Therefore, the total number of days she spent in school is: 12 years x 365 days/year = 4370 days. Now, let's calculate the total number of hours she spent studying per day. According to the question, she studied for 4 hours every day after lunchtime. Therefore, the total number of hours she studied per day is: 4 hours/day x 4370 days = 17,480 hours. Finally, let's convert the total number of hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 17,480 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 106,960 minutes. So, the answer to the question is: Srey studied for 106,960 minutes during her 12 years in school.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st) until the day when the first student graduated (March 20th). We can do this by subtracting March 20th from January 1st:

January 1st - March 20th = 130 days

Next, we need to calculate the number of students who graduated in total during these 130 days. According to the passage, there were 45 students who started their studies at the same time as the first student, and they all graduated together with him after completing their studies within 6 months. Therefore, the number of students who graduated in total is:

45 students x 6 months = 270 days

Finally, we need to convert the number of days into years. There are 365 days in a year, so we can divide the total number of days by 365 to get the approximate number of years:

270 days / 365 days per year = approximately 0.75 years

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the answer to the question ""How many years did it take for the first student to graduate?"" is approximately 0.75 years."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st). We can do this by subtracting the current date from January 1st. For example, if today is March 20th, then the number of days passed would be: 30 - 1 = 29 days. Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the year. To do this, we subtract the number of days passed from the total number of days in the year. In this case, there are 365 days in a year, so: 29 + 365 = 394 days left in the year. Finally, we multiply the number of days left in the year by the amount of money spent by Srey and her friends during their trip to Phnom Penh. Based on the information provided earlier, they spent $38 each. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by Srey and her friends during their trip to Phnom Penh is: 394 x $38 = $14,792.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of times each letter appears in the word ""សត្វ"" (stead).  The letters appear as follows:

* S: 2 times
* T: 1 time
* E: 1 time
* A: 1 time
* D: 1 time
* B: 1 time

Next, let's count the number of times each letter appears in the word ""ស្លាប"" (steel).  The letters appear as follows:

* S: 3 times
* T: 2 times
* E: 2 times
* L: 1 time
* A: 1 time
* B: 1 time

Now, let's add up the total number of appearances of each letter in both words:

* Total for ""សត្វ"": 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
* Total for ""ស្លាប"": 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the answer is 6 + 8 = 14."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $39$ apples were given to $17$ children. So, each child received $\frac{39}{17} = 2.26$ apples on average.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. According to the question, the incident happened 8 years ago. Therefore, the number of days that have passed is: 8 years x 365 days/year = 2970 days  Next, we need to determine how many times the water level in the reservoir has risen and fallen during these 2970 days. The question states that the water level rises and falls every day, so we can assume that it has risen and fallen a total of 2970 times during this period. Finally, we need to calculate the average height of each rise and fall in meters. Based on the question, the maximum height of each rise and fall is 1 meter, and the minimum height is 0.5 meters. Therefore, the average height of each rise and fall is (1 m + 0.5 m) / 2 = 0.75 meters. Now, let's calculate the total volume of water that has been displaced during these 2970 rises and falls. Assuming that the volume of water in the reservoir is constant at 1 million cubic meters, then the total volume of water displaced during each rise and fall is: Volume = Height x Capacity of reservoir = 0.75 m x 1 million cu m = 750,000 cu m So, the total volume of water displaced during all 2970 rises and falls is: Total volume = 2970 x 750,000 cu m = 2.2 billion cubic meters.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of boys who passed the examination. According to the question, out of 140 students, 50 boys and 90 girls passed the examination. Therefore, the number of boys who passed the examination is: 50/140 = 0.357 (or 35.7%) Next, we need to find out how many boys did not pass the examination. From the given information, 140 - 50 = 90 students did not pass the examination. Among them, 37 are boys, so the number of boys who did not pass the examination is: 37/90 = 0.411 (or 41.1%) Finally, we add up the number of boys who passed and did not pass the examination to get the total number of boys in the class: 0.357 + 0.411 = 0.768 (or 76.8%) So, there are approximately 76.8% boys in the class.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  The first date is January 14, 2023, and the second date is February 28, 2023.  Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:

January 14, 2023 - February 28, 2023 = 45 days

Now, we need to calculate how many weeks are there in 45 days. There are 7 days in a week, so:

45 days / 7 days/week = 6.42 weeks

Therefore, the number of weeks that passed between the two dates given in the question is:

6.42 weeks"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 rows of teeth in total and each row has 11 teeth. So, the total number of teeth is 9 x 11 = 99 teeth. Now, let's calculate how many teeth are missing. We have been told that the girl has 40 teeth left, so we need to subtract this amount from the total number of teeth. Therefore, the answer is 99 - 40 = 59 teeth remaining in her mouth.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 8 weeks. There are 7 days in one week, so there are 7 x 8 = 56 days in 8 weeks. Now, we need to calculate how many hours are there in 56 days. There are 24 hours in one day, so there are 24 x 56 = 1304 hours in 8 weeks. Finally, we divide the total number of hours by the number of working hours per day to get the approximate answer. In this case, if the person works for 8 hours per day, then the approximate answer is 1304 / 8 = 163 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""កែវ"" appears in the given text. We can see that it appears twice in the text. Therefore, the answer is 2."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  The first date is ""ម៉ារី កំពុងតែធ្វើកែវ"" which means January 1st, 2023.  The second date is ""អង្ករ ១ កែវទៀត"" which means March 15th, 2023.  Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:

March 15th, 2023 - January 1st, 2023 = 3 months and 15 days

Now, we need to convert this time period into weeks. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

3 months x 4 weeks/month = 12 weeks
Adding the remaining days (15 days) gives us a total of:

12 weeks + 15 days = 27 weeks

Therefore, the answer to the question is 27 weeks."
"Response:  If we have 120 students in a class and each student has to take 3 exams, then the total number of exams is:

120 students x 3 exams per student = 360 exams

Now, let's assume that 50% of the exams are easy, 30% are medium difficulty, and 20% are difficult. So, the number of easy exams is:

50% of 360 exams = 180 exams
The number of medium-difficulty exams is:

30% of 360 exams = 108 exams
The number of difficult exams is:

20% of 360 exams = 72 exams

Therefore, there will be a total of 180 + 108 + 72 = 360 exams for the students to take."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 cows and 5 goats in total.  Then, we need to calculate how many days each animal has been pregnant for. For the cows, it takes 9 months (or 360 days) for them to give birth, so they have been pregnant for 360 days. However, since the baby calves were born recently, we can assume that their mothers haven't given birth yet, so they are still pregnant. Therefore, the number of days the cows have been pregnant is 360 - (the current date - the day the baby calves were born). Similarly, for the goats, it takes 150 days (or 5 months) for them to give birth, so they have been pregnant for 5 months. Now, let's calculate the total number of days each animal has been pregnant: Cows: 360 - (current date - day baby calves were born) Goats: 5 months = 180 days  Finally, we add up all these numbers to get the total number of days all the animals have been pregnant: Total: 360 - (current date - day baby calves were born) + 180 = 540 days
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the last time the girl saw her father. From the question, we know that it has been 10 days since she last saw him. So, the number of days that have passed is:  

10 days

Next, we need to determine how many times the girl has seen her father in total. According to the question, the girl has seen her father 34 times before he went missing. Therefore, the total number of times the girl has seen her father is:

"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. According to the question, the incident happened 12 years ago, and now it is 2023. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred is:

12 years = 12 x 365 days/year = 4385 days

Next, we need to calculate the number of days that the woman has been working as a nurse. According to the question, she has worked for 18 years, and now she is 60 years old. Therefore, the number of days that she has worked as a nurse is:

18 years = 18 x 365 days/year = 6795 days

Finally, we add the total number of days that the woman has worked as a nurse to the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred to get the total number of days that the woman has spent caring for patients:

Total days = 6795 days + 4385 days = 11,180 days

Therefore, the answer to the question is 11,180 days."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. According to the question, the incident happened 10 years ago, so the calculation is as follows: 10 years = 3653 days (based on a non-leap year) or 3662 days (based on a leap year).

There are two occurrences of the digit 2 in the text: ""ម៉ារី កំពុងតែធ្វើកែវ"" and ""ស្ករ ១៣កែវ"". Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 cows in total and each cow gives birth to 1 calf at a time. So, the number of calves born is 9 x 1 = 9.  Next, we know that out of these 9 calves, 4 died during the first year. Therefore, the number of surviving calves is 9 - 4 = 5.  Finally, we are asked how many calves will be born in the next year if the average age of death for a calf is 2 years. To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of calves (5) by the average age of death (2), which gives us 5 / 2 = 2.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a calf, the answer is rounded down to 2 calves.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 2 calves.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""កំពុង"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After finding out the number of appearances of ""កំពុង"", we need to divide it by 5 to get the average number of appearances per line.  Finally, we multiply the result by 100 to convert it into percentage. So, the answer is:  (Number of appearances of ""កំពុង"") / 5 x 100 = _______________%."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. According to the question, the incident happened 14 days ago. Therefore, the number of days that have passed is:

14 days = 14 x 24 hours/day = 336 hours

Next, we need to convert the number of hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

336 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 20,792 minutes

Finally, we divide the total number of minutes by the duration of the training program (which is 180 days) to get the approximate percentage of progress made so far:

20,792 minutes / 180 days = approximately 11.5%

Therefore, based on the calculation above, the approximate percentage of progress made so far is 11.5%."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 360 degrees in a full circle (360°). Now, let's calculate how many degrees are between each of the two points given in the question: Point A and Point B.  From Point A to Point B, there are 180 degrees. Therefore, if we divide 360 by 2, we get 180 as the number of degrees between Point A and Point B.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days that the baby was in the womb before birth. The question states that the baby was born after 37 weeks of gestation, which is equivalent to 260 days (37 x 7). Therefore, the total number of days from conception to birth is: 260 + 9 months = 350 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""កំពុង"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After finding out the number of appearances of ""កំពុង"", we need to divide it by 2 because there are two words ""កំពុង"" in the first line of the text. So, the result will be half of the total number of appearances of ""កំពុង"".  Now, let's calculate the number of appearances of ""កំពុង"" in the given text. There are three instances of ""កំពុង"" in the text: ម៉ារី កំពុងតែធ្វើកែវ ម្ហូបនេះមានទឹកឃ្មុំ ១១កែវ និងអង្ករ ៩កែវ ។ Therefore, the number of appearances of ""កំពុង"" is 3 / 2 = 1.5.  Finally, we multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage: 1.5 x 100 = 150%.  So, the answer to the question is 150%."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st). We can do this by subtracting the current date from January 1st. For example, if today is March 20th, then the number of days passed would be: 30 - 1 = 29 days. Next, we need to determine how many weeks are in 29 days. There are 7 days in a week, so there are: 29 / 7 = 4 weeks. Finally, we multiply the number of weeks by 7 to get the total number of days: 4 x 7 = 28 days. Therefore, the correct answer is 28 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days in 8 years. There are 365 days in a year, so there are:

$$ \text {Total number of days} = 8 \times 365 = 2920 \text{ days} $$

Now, let's find out how many times $14$ occurs in the given time period:

$$ \text {Number of occurrences of } 14 = \frac{\text {Total number of days}} {\text {Duration of each cycle }} $$

The duration of each cycle is $7$ years, so:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text {Number of occurrences of } 14 &= \frac{2920}{7} \\ &= 40 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, the answer is $40$."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st). We can do this by subtracting the current date from January 1st. For example, if today is March 20th, then the number of days that have passed since January 1st is: 30 + 60 = 90 days. Next, we need to determine how many weeks are in 90 days. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 90 by 7 to get the number of weeks: 90 / 7 = 12.5 weeks. Since there are no fractional weeks, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13 weeks. Therefore, the answer to the question is: 13 weeks.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""កែវ"" appears in the given text. We can see that it appears twice in the text. Therefore, the answer is 2."

Now, let's calculate the number of hours spent by the girl playing games per day:  She spends 4 hours playing games every day, so the total number of hours she spends playing games in a week is: 4 x 7 = 28 hours. Therefore, the answer to the question is: 28 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 10 appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of digits that are multiples of 10. In this case, there are three such digits: 10, 20, and 30. Therefore, the answer is 3.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979). According to the United Nations, it is estimated that around 1.7 million Cambodians died during this period, which accounts for about 30% of the country's population at that time. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million.  Next, we need to calculate the percentage of those deaths that occurred in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Unfortunately, there are no reliable statistics available on the exact number of deaths in Phnom Penh during this period. However, according to some estimates, around 20% of the total deaths during the Khmer Rouge regime occurred in Phnom Penh. Using this percentage and multiplying it by the total number of deaths, we can estimate that around 340,000 Cambodians died in Phnom Penh during the Khmer Rouge regime.  Finally, we need to determine whether the number of deaths in Phnom Penh is greater than or equal to 10%. Based on our calculation above, the number of deaths in Phnom Penh is approximately 340,000. When compared with the total population of Phnom Penh at that time, which was around 1.5 million, we can see that the number of deaths is indeed greater than 10%, which is 22.67% to be precise.  In conclusion, based on the calculations provided above, the answer to the question ""Is the number of deaths in Phnom Penh during the Khmer Rouge regime greater than or equal to 10% of the total population?"" is yes, as the number of deaths in Phnom Penh is greater than 10% of the total population."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979). According to the United Nations, it is estimated that around 1.7 million Cambodians died during this period, which accounts for about 30% of the country's population at that time. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million. Now, let's calculate the percentage of these deaths among the total population of Cambodia in 1979. Based on the estimates provided by the World Bank, the population of Cambodia in 1979 was around 8 million. Dividing the number of deaths (1.7 million) by the total population (8 million) gives us a percentage of around 21.25%. So, approximately 21.25% of the Cambodian population died during the Khmer Rouge regime.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979. According to the United Nations, it is estimated that around 1.7 million Cambodians died during this period, which accounts for about 30% of the country's population at that time. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million. Now, let's calculate the percentage of those who survived based on the total population of Cambodia in 1979, which was around 8 million according to the World Bank. So, the percentage of survivors can be calculated as follows: (1 - 0.2 = 0.8) x 100 = 80%. This means that about 80% of the Cambodian population survived the Khmer Rouge regime, while the remaining 20% were killed.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979). According to the United Nations, it is estimated that around 1.7 million Cambodians died during this period, which accounts for about 30% of the country's population at that time. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million.  Next, we need to determine how many of these deaths occurred in the killing fields. The term ""killing fields"" refers to the mass graves and sites where the Khmer Rouge regime executed its victims. It is estimated that there are over 20,000 such sites throughout Cambodia, with each site containing hundreds or even thousands of bodies. However, not all of these sites have been identified or excavated, so the exact number of deaths in the killing fields is difficult to determine. Nevertheless, based on available data and estimates, it is believed that tens of thousands of Cambodians were killed in the killing fields.  Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of Cambodian people who were killed in the killing fields relative to the total number of deaths during the Khmer Rouge regime. To do this, we divide the number of deaths in the killing fields by the total number of deaths during the regime, which gives us a proportion of around 10%. This means that roughly 10% of the total number of Cambodian people killed during the Khmer Rouge regime died in the killing fields.  Based on these calculations, the answer to the question is:  Approximately 10% of the total number of Cambodian people killed during the Khmer Rouge regime died in the killing fields."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime. According to the question, there were 31 Khmer Rouge leaders who were put to death after being found guilty of crimes against humanity and genocide. However, not all of these leaders were responsible for killing Cambodians directly. Some of them might have played indirect roles in the atrocities committed during that period. Therefore, let us assume that only half of these leaders (15) were directly involved in killing Cambodians. This means that the total number of Cambodians killed under their watch is 15 x 31 = 465. Next, we need to calculate the percentage of Cambodians among the total population of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge era. Unfortunately, there are no reliable statistics available on the population size of Cambodia during this time period. However, according to some estimates, the population of Cambodia was around 8 million in 1970, which increased to approximately 10 million by 1979. Assuming an average annual growth rate of 2%, the population of Cambodia would be around 10.4 million in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge took power. Now, let us apply the percentage calculated earlier to the estimated population size of Cambodia in 1975. If 465 Cambodians were killed out of every 100,000 people, then the total number of Cambodians killed during the Khmer Rouge era can be calculated as follows: Total number of Cambodians killed = Percentage of Cambodians killed x Estimated population size of Cambodia in 1975 x 100,000 So, the total number of Cambodians killed during the Khmer Rouge era is approximately 465 x 10,400,000 x 100,000 = 4,650,000. Finally, we need to convert this figure into a decimal format to get our final answer. Since there are 100,000 in one million, we can divide the total number of Cambodians killed by 100,000 to obtain the decimal equivalent: 4,6
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many types of rice are there in Cambodia. According to the question, there are 38 different types of rice in Cambodia.  Next, we need to calculate how much land is needed to grow all these types of rice. Based on the information provided, it takes 1 hectare of land to produce 47 bags of rice (which is equivalent to 160 kilograms). Therefore, to produce all 38 types of rice, we would need 38 x 1 = 38 hectares of land. Finally, we need to calculate how long it takes to harvest all these crops. According to the question, it takes 3 months to harvest rice. So, if we have 38 hectares of land and it takes 3 months to harvest all the crops, then we can harvest approximately 38 hectares x 3 = 114 bags of rice per month.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979). According to the United Nations, it is estimated that around 1.7 million Cambodians died during this period, which accounts for about 30% of the country's population at that time. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million.  Next, we need to calculate the percentage of those who survived and are still alive today. Assuming that there were 8 million Cambodians living in Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge took power, and taking into account the mortality rate during the regime, it is estimated that only around 2 million Cambodians survived. This means that around 60% of the original population did not survive the regime.  Finally, we need to determine how many Cambodian people have returned home since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 90% of Cambodia's refugees have now returned home. Based on the current population of Cambodia, which is around 16 million, we can estimate that around 14 million Cambodians have returned home since the fall of the Khmer Rouge.  In conclusion, the total number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million, while around 60% of the original population did not survive the regime. Moreover, around 14 million Cambodians have returned home since the fall of the Khmer Rouge.

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been affected by the flooding in Kampong Cham province. According to the question, there are 18,000 families or approximately 76,000 people who have been affected by the flooding. Therefore, the answer is (D) 76,000.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the Cambodian government announced its decision to build the Preah Sihanouk Expressway (PSE) in 2013. According to the article, it has been 8 years since then. Therefore, the number of days that have passed is:  8 years x 365 days/year = 29,200 days  Next, we need to calculate the total cost of building the PSE project. Based on the information provided in the article, the estimated cost of the project is around $2.7 billion. So, the total cost can be calculated as follows:  2.7 billion dollars / 100 million dollars (the cost per kilometer of the road) = 27 kilometers  Finally, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters. There are 1,000 meters in one kilometer, so:  27 kilometers x 1,000 meters/kilometer = 27,000,000 meters  In conclusion, based on the given information, the answer to the question is:  27,000,000 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have been killed during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979). According to the United Nations, it is estimated that around 1.7 million Cambodians died during this period, which accounts for about 30% of the country's population at that time. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime is approximately 1.7 million.  Next, we need to calculate the percentage of those who survived and are still alive today. Assuming that there were around 4.8 million Cambodians living in Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, and considering that some of them may have fled or been displaced during the regime, let's assume that the current population of Cambodia is around 4 million. This means that around 60% of the original population has survived, as only 60% of 4.8 million is equal to 2.88 million.  Now, let's calculate the total number of Cambodian people who have lived since the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 until present day. Based on our previous calculation, around 2.88 million Cambodians survived the genocide, and assuming that they had children and grandchildren, their descendants would increase the total number of Cambodians living today. However, due to various factors such as migration, death, and intermarriage, it is difficult to provide an exact figure. Nevertheless, based on rough estimates, the total number of Cambodians living today could be around 6-7 million.  Finally, to answer your question directly, around 1.7 million Cambodians were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime, while around 6-7 million Cambodians are currently living in Cambodia.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students passed the examination in each group (Group A and Group B). We know that there are 40 students who passed the examination in total, so the number of students passing the examination in each group can be calculated as follows: Group A: Number of students passing = Total number of students x Percentage of students passing in Group A = 40 x 70/100 = 28 Group B: Number of students passing = Total number of students x Percentage of students passing in Group B = 40 x 30/100 = 12 Therefore, there are 28 students from Group A and 12 students from Group B who passed the examination. Now, let's calculate the percentage of students passing for each group: Group A: Percentage of students passing = Number of students passing / Total number of students x 100 = 28/40 x 100 = 70% Group B: Percentage of students passing = Number of students passing / Total number of students x 100 = 12/40 x 100 = 30% So, 70% of the students from Group A passed the examination, while 30% of the students from Group B passed it.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many Cambodian people have studied abroad. According to the question, there are 300 Cambodian students who have studied in Japan and returned home. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who have studied abroad is equal to 300.  Next, we need to find out how many of them have become successful businesspeople. The question states that 20 of them have become successful businesspeople, so the number of successful businesspeople among those who have studied abroad is equal to 20.  Finally, we need to find out what percentage of successful businesspeople among those who have studied abroad are women. According to the question, there are 5 women among the 20 successful businesspeople, so the percentage of women among successful businesspeople who have studied abroad is equal to 5/20 x 100 = 25%.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event (January 1st, 2023) from the date of the second event (March 25th, 2023).  Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:

25th March - 1st January = 84 days

We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event (January 10th) from the date of the second event (February 25th).  So, the number of days between these two dates is:  January 10th - February 25th = 45 days  Next, we need to calculate how many working days are there between these two dates. A working day is defined as any day that is not a Saturday or a Sunday. Using the list of holidays provided at the end of the question, we can identify the following non-working days:  •	January 1st (New Year’s Day) •	January 3rd (Khmer New Year) •	February 18th (International Women’s Day) •	March 7th (Meak Bochea Day) •	April 13th (Choul Chnam Thmey) •	May 1st (Labour Day) •	September 9th (Independence Day) •	November 2nd (Day of the King) •	December 24th (Christmas Eve) •	December 25th (Christmas Day) •	December 31st (New Year’s Eve) Based on this list, we can count the number of non-working days between January 10th and February 25th:  •	January 1st (New Year’s Day) •	January 3rd (Khmer New Year) •	February 18th (International Women’s Day) •	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•	•
Response:  The question asks about the number of people who have been infected with COVID-19 in Cambodia as of today (April 28). To find out this information, we need to look at the latest data released by the Ministry of Health. As of April 27, the total number of confirmed cases in Cambodia was 145, and the number of recoveries was 106. So, the number of active cases in Cambodia as of April 28 is: Active cases = Total cases - Recovered cases = 145 - 106 = 39. Therefore, as of April 28, there are 39 active cases of COVID-19 in Cambodia.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since January 1st, 2022. We know that there are 365 days in a year, so if today is March 28th, 2022, then the number of days passed since January 1st, 2022 is:

Days Passed = Today's Date - January 1st, 2022 Days = 28-1 = 27

Now, let's calculate the total number of working days from January 1st, 2022 to March 28th, 2022:
Total Working Days = Total Number of Days - Non-Working Days Total Working Days = 27 + (213 - 16) = 294

So, the answer to the question is 294 working days have passed since January 1st, 2022."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the last time the person had breakfast. Based on the information provided in the question, it is mentioned that the person has not eaten anything for 38 hours. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since the last time they had breakfast is: 38 hours / 24 hours per day = 1.56 days (or 1 day and 9 hours)  Next, we need to determine how many times the person has eaten something during this period. According to the question, the person has eaten only once during this period, which was at around 8 am on the previous day. Therefore, the number of times the person has eaten something during this period is: 1 time  Finally, we need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of meals the person has missed: Total number of meals missed = Number of days passed x Number of times food has been eaten = 1.56 days x 1 time = 1.56 meals So, based on the calculation above, the person has missed approximately 1.56 meals since their last breakfast.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the person started working at the company. According to the question, the person has been working for 10 years, and they were promoted to their current position after 5 years of work. So, the total number of years that the person has worked at the company is 10 + 5 = 15 years.  Next, we need to calculate how many days there are in 15 years. There are 365 days in a year, so there are 365 x 15 = 5,475 days in 15 years.  Finally, we need to subtract the number of days that the person has worked from the total number of days in 15 years to get the number of days that the person has been working at their current position. Therefore, the answer is 5,475 - 820 (the number of days the person has worked) = 4,655 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last time the person had breakfast. According to the question, it has been 3 days since the person had breakfast last.  Next, we need to calculate how much food the person needs to eat based on their weight and activity level. Based on the information provided in the question, the person's weight is 70 kg and they are moderately active. Using an online calorie calculator, we can determine that the person needs approximately 2400-2800 calories per day for maintenance purposes. However, if the person wants to gain weight, they will need more calories than this amount. Therefore, let's assume that the person needs around 3000 calories per day to gain weight.  Now, let's calculate how much food the person needs to eat each day to achieve this goal. To do this, we divide the daily calorie requirement by the number of meals the person eats per day. Assuming the person eats 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), we can calculate the approximate amount of food the person needs to eat at each meal as follows: Breakfast: 3000 / 3 = 1000 calories per meal Lunch: 3000 / 3 = 1000 calories per meal Dinner: 3000 / 3 = 1000 calories per meal  Finally, we need to add up the total amount of food the person needs to eat each day to determine how much they should consume at each meal. In this case, the total daily calorie requirement is 3000 x 3 = 9000 calories. Therefore, the person needs to eat around 1000 calories per meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) to meet their daily calorie requirements and gain weight.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the last time the king visited the temple. According to the question, it has been 3 years and 8 months since then. So, we can calculate the number of days as follows: 3 years x 365 days/year = 1095 days + 8 months x 30 days/month = 240 days = 1335 days  Next, we need to find out how many times the king has visited the temple in total. According to the question, he has visited the temple 492 times. Therefore, we can conclude that the king has visited the temple for a total of 1335 days / 492 visits = approximately 2.7 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event (January 1, 1970) from the second date (December 31, 2022).  Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:  January 1, 1970 - December 31, 2022 = 521 days  Next, we need to calculate the total number of working days during this period. To do this, we will subtract the number of weekends and holidays from the total number of days. According to the question, there were 154 Saturdays and Sundays during this period, so we will deduct them from the total number of days. Therefore, the total number of working days during this period is:  Total number of days - Number of weekends and holidays = 521 days - 154 days = 367 days  Finally, we need to convert the number of working days into hours. There are 8 hours in a day, so we can multiply the number of working days by 8 to get the total number of hours worked during this period:  Total number of hours worked = 367 days x 8 hours/day = 2936 hours  Therefore, the answer to the question is:  The person worked for 2936 hours during the period from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 2022.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event (January 20, 1979) from the date of the second event (March 28, 1979).  Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:  January 20, 1979 - March 28, 1979 = 54 days  Next, we need to calculate how many Sundays there are within that period of 54 days. To do this, we simply count the number of Sundays that fall within those 54 days. There are 7 Sundays in a month, so if we multiply the number of days by 7, we get:  54 days x 7 Sundays/day = 388 Sundays  Finally, we need to convert the total number of Sundays into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of Sundays by 7 to get the number of weeks:  388 Sundays / 7 days/week = 56 weeks  So, there were 56 weeks between the two events mentioned in the question.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between June 25th and July 28th. We can do this by subtracting the two dates:

June 25th - July 28th = 43 days

Now, let's calculate how many times the moon is full during these 43 days:

Full Moon Days = (43 x 7) / 12 = 29 full moons

So, there are 29 full moons from June 25th to July 28th."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event (January 8, 1979) from the date of the second event (February 20, 1979).  Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:  January 8, 1979 - February 20, 1979 = 31 days So, the answer to the question is 31 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred. According to the question, the incident happened on January 20th, so it has been 38 days since then.  Next, we need to determine how many times the water level in the reservoir has risen and fallen during this period. Based on the information provided, the water level in the reservoir rises every day by an average of 1 meter, and falls back down to its original level every night. Therefore, the water level in the reservoir has risen and fallen a total of 38 x 2 = 76 times during this period.  Finally, we need to calculate the total volume of water that has flowed into the reservoir during this time. Since the water level in the reservoir rises by 1 meter every day, the total volume of water that has flowed into the reservoir is equal to the product of the number of days that have passed (38) and the daily increase in water level (1 meter). Therefore, the total volume of water that has flowed into the reservoir is 38 x 1 = 38 cubic meters.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event (January 1, 1970) from the date of the second event (December 31, 2022).  Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:  January 1, 1970 - December 31, 2022 = 523 days  So, the answer to the question is 523 days.
"Response:  If there are 12 students in total and 4 of them passed the exam, then the number of students who did not pass the exam is:

Number of students who did not pass the exam = Total number of students - Number of students who passed the exam
= 12 - 4
= 8

So, there are 8 students who did not pass the exam."
Response:  We know that there are 3 people who can speak English fluently and 4 people who cannot speak English at all. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 people. Now, let's assume that among these 7 people, 2 of them are able to understand each other perfectly without any difficulty. Therefore, the number of people who can understand each other is 2 out of 7 = 1/3.
Response:  We have 9 students who passed the exam and we want to know how many of them will get a prize. So, the number of prizes that can be given is 9. Now, there are 12 students in total, including those who got a prize and those who didn't. Therefore, the number of students who did not get a prize is 3 (12 - 9 = 3).
Response:  We have 14 people in total (including the speaker). Among them, there are 5 old men who can't hear well (the speaker is asking for their opinions). So, we need to subtract 5 from 14 to get the number of people who can hear well. Therefore, the answer is 9.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 people in total - A, B, and C.  Each of them has their own number of children, which is given as follows:
A has 2 children, B has 4 children, and C has 5 children.  Therefore, the total number of children among all three people is:
2 + 4 + 5 = 11 children."
Response:  We have 16 people in total (15 + 1). Among them, 14 are able to swim. So, the number of people who cannot swim is:  16 - 14 = 2.
Response:  We know that there are 3 people who can speak English fluently and 5 people who cannot speak English at all. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 people. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that there are 3 people who can speak English fluently and 5 people who cannot speak English at all. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 people. Now, let's assume that among these 8 people, 4 of them can speak some English but not fluently. Therefore, the number of people who can speak English fluently is 3, and the number of people who cannot speak English at all is 5.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 students in total, and we want to find out how many of them have passed the exam.  Since 4 students have failed, we can subtract their number from the total number of students to get the passing students. Therefore, the number of passing students is:

$$ \text {Passing students} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of failing students} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Passing students} &= 12 - 4 \\ &= 8 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, there are 8 passing students among the 12 students who took the exam."
Response:  We have three balls and we want to put them in two baskets. So, each basket will contain one ball. Now, let's assume that there are 10 baskets in total. Therefore, the probability of putting all three balls in one basket is (1/10) = 0.1 or 10%.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 options for the number of balls in the bag: 0, 1, 2, or 3.  For each option, we have to calculate the probability of having exactly one ball of each color.  The probabilities are as follows:

* Option 0 (no balls): P(0) = 1/5, since there is no chance of having any balls of any color.
* Option 1 (one red ball and one white ball): P(1) = 2/5, since there is a 1/5 chance of getting either a red or a white ball, and each ball has a 1/5 chance of being chosen.
* Option 2 (two red balls and one white ball): P(2) = 3/5, since there is a 1/5 chance of getting two red balls and a 1/5 chance of getting a white ball.
* Option 3 (three red balls and none white): P(3) = 1/5, since there is a 1/5 chance of getting three red balls without any white balls.

Now, let's calculate the total probability of each option:

P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) = 1

So, the final answer is:

The probability of having exactly one ball of each color in a bag with 4 balls is 1/5."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 people in total (A, B, C, and D).  Secondly, we know that A has 3 children, so the number of children for person A is 3. Thirdly, we know that B has no children, so the number of children for person B is 0. Fourthly, we know that C has 2 children, so the number of children for person C is 2. Lastly, we know that D has 5 children, so the number of children for person D is 5. Therefore, the sum of all the numbers of children for each person is: 3 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 10.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the word ""សាច់"" appears in the given text.  To do this, we count the number of occurrences of each letter in the word ""សាច់"".  The letters in the word ""សាច់"" are: s - a - c - h - o - t - l - e - b - i - d - s.  Therefore, there are 10 letters in the word ""សាច់"".  Now, let's count the number of times each letter appears in the given text:  s - 4 times; a - 2 times; c - 2 times; h - 1 time; o - 2 times; t - 1 time; l - 1 time; e - 1 time; b - 1 time; i - 1 time; d - 1 time; s - 1 time.  So, the total number of times the word ""សាច់"" appears in the given text is 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15 times.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 15."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two bags of rice and each bag contains 50 kg of rice. So, in total, there are 100 kg of rice (2 x 50 kg).  Next, we are asked how much money was spent to buy these 100 kg of rice. We know that the price of one kilogram of rice is $6, so the total cost of buying 100 kg of rice would be $6 x 100 kg = $600. Therefore, the amount of money left after buying the rice is $600 - $3 = $597.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the three items:  Cost of item A = $80 Cost of item B = $120 Cost of item C = $160 Total cost = $80 + $120 + $160 = $360 Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying these three items: Money left = Total cost - Amount spent = $360 - ($80 + $120 + $160) = $360 - $480 = $90 So, there is $90 left after buying all three items.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 options for the number of balls in the first basket (A, B, C, and D). Similarly, there are 3 options for the number of balls in the second basket (E, F, G). So, we have a total of $4 \times 3 = 12$ possible combinations. Now, let's count how many times each combination appears in the given information:

* Combination A-D: 2 balls in the first basket, 5 balls in the second basket - occurs once ($2 \times 5 = 10$).
* Combination B-D: 2 balls in the first basket, 5 balls in the second basket - occurs twice ($2 \times 5 = 10$, $2 \times 5 = 10$).
* Combination C-D: 2 balls in the first basket, 5 balls in the second basket - occurs thrice ($2 \times 5 = 10$, $2 \times 5 = 10$, $2 \times 5 = 10$).
* Combination E-G: 3 balls in the first basket, 2 balls in the second basket - occurs once ($3 \times 2 = 6$).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$$\boxed{10 + 10 + 10 + 6 = 46}$$"
Response:  We know that there are two types of people in this scenario: those who have more than $6 and those who have less than or equal to $6.  So, the probability that someone has exactly $6 is (number of people with more than $6) / (total number of people).  Since there are 4 people in total, we can calculate the probability as follows:  Probability = (2) / (4) = 0.5 or 50%  Therefore, the answer is 50%.
Response:  We know that there are 5 questions in total.  For each question, we have to choose one of the options from A, B, C or D. So, the probability of choosing the correct option for each question is 1/4. Now, let's calculate the probability of getting all 5 questions correct:  P(A) = (1/4)^5 = 0.0392 Or approximately 0.392. Therefore, the expected number of students who will get all 5 questions correct is 0.392 x 100 = 39.2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 cars in total. Then, we are asked how many of them have been sold. So, the number of cars sold is equal to 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, one car has been sold.
Response:  We know that there are 3 balls in total and we want to find out how many of them are red. So, let's assume that each ball has an equal chance of being either red or blue (or any other color). Therefore, the probability of a ball being red is also 1/3. Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to update our knowledge based on the information given in the problem: P(red|blue) = P(blue|red) \* P(red)/P(blue) = 2/3 \* 1/2 = 1/3 Since there are 4 choices for the color of the last ball (red, blue, green, yellow), the probability of it being red is 1/4. So, the final answer is: There are 3 red balls among the 4 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of buying all four cars. The price of each car is $30,000, so the total cost would be: $30,000 x 4 = $120,000. Now, let's consider how much money Sokun has saved from his job as an accountant. He has saved $30,000, which is equal to half of the total cost of buying one car. Therefore, he can afford to buy two cars with the remaining amount of $90,000 ($120,000 - $30,000). So, the answer is: 2 cars.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 boxes of chocolates with different prices as follows: Box A - $4 each; Box B - $6 each; and Box C - $8 each.  We also know that we have bought 2 boxes of chocolates so far, which cost a total of $10. Therefore, the remaining amount of money left after buying the chocolates is: $10 - $10 = $0. So, the answer is $0."
Response:  We know that there are 5 questions in total.  For each question, we have to choose one of the options from A to E. So, the number of possible answers is 5 x 5 = 25. Now, let's analyze each option carefully: Option A: This option means that all 6 people can see the same thing. However, this is not possible as everyone has their own perspective and cannot see exactly what others see. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B: This option suggests that 3 people can see something different. However, since we are dealing with 6 people here, it is impossible for only 3 people to see something different. Hence, option B is also incorrect. Option C: This option implies that 4 people can see something similar but not exactly the same. Unfortunately, this is still not possible as each person has their unique perspective. Thus, option C is incorrect too. Option D: This choice indicates that 2 people can see something completely different. While it is true that two people may have different perspectives, it is unlikely that they will both be able to see something entirely distinct from what the other sees. As such, option D is also incorrect. Finally, we come to option E, which states that none of the above options are correct. Given our analysis so far, this seems like the most plausible answer. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, the correct answer is (E) None of the above options are correct.
Response:  We know that there are 4 options for the first part of the question (the number of people who have been to Phnom Penh): A) 10, B) 20, C) 30, or D) 40.  For the second part of the question (the number of people who have visited Siem Reap), we also have 4 options: A) 5, B) 10, C) 15, or D) 20.  Therefore, the total number of people who have been to both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap is: $ \text {(A) 10} + \text{ (B) 20} + \text{ (C) 30} + \text{ (D) 40} = 80$.
Response:  We know that there are 126 students in total and they are divided into groups of 4 students each. So, we have: Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 126 / 31 = 4 groups. Therefore, there are 4 groups of students.
"Response:  We know that there are 137 people in the group and 105 of them have been infected with COVID-19. So, the number of people who haven't been infected is:

$$ \text{Number of uninfected people} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of infected people} $$

Substituting the values we know into the equation above, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Number of uninfected people} &= 137 - 105 \\ &= 32 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, out of 137 people in the group, 32 (or 23%) have not been infected with COVID-19."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 108 Cambodian students studying abroad in Japan.  Secondly, we need to calculate how many of them have returned home after completing their studies. Based on the information provided, 36 of them have returned home. Therefore, the number of Cambodian students who are still studying in Japan is 72 (108 - 36).
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and we have to divide it by 10 to get the number of months. So, 365 / 10 = 36.5 months. Now, let's calculate how many weeks are in each month. There are 4 weeks in every month, so 36.5 months x 4 weeks/month = 146 weeks. Finally, let's convert the number of weeks to years. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, 146 weeks / 52 weeks/year = 2.78 years. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2 years and 9 months.
Response:  We know that there are 20 questions in total and each question has 4 options to choose from. So, we have a total of 80 options (20 x 4). Now, let's analyze the given information carefully:  The first question asks about the number of balls that were thrown into the basket. There are 4 options for this question: 15, 20, 25, or 30. Since none of these options match the actual answer (which is 16), we can eliminate all of them.  The second question asks how many baskets were made during the game. Again, there are 4 options: 4, 7, 9, or 12. However, only one option matches the actual answer (which is 9). Therefore, we can mark this question as correct.  For the third question, we are asked to find out how many boys are playing football. There are 4 options again: 10, 15, 20, or 25. Unfortunately, none of these options match the actual answer (which is 12). So, we cannot mark any of these questions as correct.  Finally, the fourth question asks us to calculate the average score of the team based on their performance in the previous games. There are 4 options here too: 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, or 5.5. But since the actual answer is 3.8, we can mark this question as correct.  In conclusion, we have marked 2 questions as correct and eliminated the remaining 2 questions. Therefore, our final answer is:  Correct answers: 2 Incorrect answers: 2
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in total.  Among them, 4 students have scored A grade, and 8 students have scored B grade. Therefore, the number of students who have not passed is: $ \text {Not Passed} = \text{Total Students} - (\text{A Grade} + \text{B Grade}) $ $= 20 - (4 + 8) $ $= 10$ So, out of 20 students, 10 students have not passed.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 letters in the Cambodian alphabet.  Secondly, we know that the word ""ប៉ុល"" has 7 letters. Thirdly, we know that the word ""មានសៀវភៅចំនួន៧១"" has 15 letters. Fourthly, we know that the word ""ក្រោយពីលក់នៅផ្សារលក់រថយន្ត"" has 20 letters. Fifthly, we know that the phrase ""គាត់បានទិញថ្មីចំនួន"" has 18 letters. Sixthly, we know that the phrase ""បើគាត់មានសៀវភៅចំនួន"" has 14 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in all the words and phrases is: 36 + 7 + 15 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 9 + 21 = 155 letters."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul has 108 followers and 36 friends.  Secondly, we are asked about the number of people who have liked his posts. Based on the information provided earlier, we can see that Paul has posted 5 times and each post has received an average of 20 likes. Therefore, the total number of likes he has received is 5 x 20 = 100 likes. Finally, we are also asked about the number of people who have watched his videos. According to the information given in the passage, Paul has uploaded 4 videos and each video has been viewed an average of 30 times. So, the total number of views he has received is 4 x 30 = 120 views.  In conclusion, the answers to the questions are as follows: Number of followers = 108 Number of friends = 36 Number of likes on posts = 100 Total number of likes = 100 + 108 = 208 Total number of views = 120 + 108 = 228
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul has 31 years old and he has been working for 10 years in his current company. Therefore, the total number of years he has worked is 31 + 10 = 41 years.  Secondly, we are asked about the number of employees under his supervision. Based on the information provided earlier, there are 25 employees who report directly to him, and another 15 employees who report indirectly to him through their line managers. So, the total number of employees under his supervision is 25 + 15 = 40 employees. Finally, we are asked about the number of levels above him in the organizational hierarchy. According to the information given, there are 7 layers or levels above him in the organization. Therefore, the answer is 4 (levels) x 10 (employees per level) = 40 employees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 365 days in a year.  Secondly, we know that the sun rises at 06:00 and sets at 18:00 every day. Therefore, the total number of hours the sun is visible per day is 12 (from 06:00 to 18:00). Thirdly, we know that there are 24 hours in a day. So, the total number of hours the sun is visible per month is: 12 x 30 = 360 hours/month. Fourthly, we know that there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the total number of hours the sun is visible per year is: 360 x 12 = 4,320 hours/year. Finally, we know that the sun has been shining for approximately 4.6 billion years. Therefore, the total number of hours the sun has been shining since its creation is: 4,320 x 4.6 = 19,764,800 hours.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. According to the question, there are 34 classes with an average of 10 students per class, so the total number of students is:

Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Average Number of Students per Class
= 34 x 10
= 340 students

Now, let's find out how many students passed the examination. The question states that 85% of the students passed the examination, which means that the number of passing students is:

Number of Passing Students = Total Number of Students x Percentage of Passing Students
= 340 x 0.85
= 286 students

Therefore, the answer to the question is 286 students."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul has 46 cards in his deck and he draws 13 cards at a time. So, the number of cards he drew is 13.  Next, we are asked about the number of cards he has left after drawing 13 cards. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of cards he drew from the total number of cards in his deck, which is 46 - 13 = 33. Therefore, Paul has 33 cards left in his deck after drawing 13 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the group of friends who went to the beach together. According to the question, there are 42 people in total, including the narrator and their friends. So, the number of people in the group is 42.  Next, we need to calculate the number of sets of sunscreen that each person needs to bring based on the information provided in the question. The narrator mentions that they brought 10 bottles of sunscreen for themselves and their friends, which means there are 10 x 42 = 420 bottles of sunscreen in total. Therefore, each person needs to bring approximately 420 / 42 = 10 bottles of sunscreen per trip to the beach.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 3 dogs and each dog has 5 puppies. Therefore, in total, Jessica has 3 x 5 = 15 puppies.  Next, we are asked how many puppies Jessica has in total. So, we add the number of puppies she has to the number of dogs she owns, which is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, Jessica has 6 + 15 = 21 puppies in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 16 cards in her hand and she draws one card from the deck. Therefore, there are 15 cards left in the deck.  Next, we know that the drawn card is a heart, so there are now 4 hearts remaining in the deck.  Finally, we know that the total number of cards in the deck was 52, so there were originally 38 non-heart cards in the deck (52 - 16 = 36).  Therefore, the probability of drawing a non-heart card from the deck is 38/52 or 0.75.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 4 cards in her hand (Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces).  Secondly, she draws one card from the deck and gets a Jack.

Therefore, the number of cards Jessica has in her hand is 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 32 pencils in her bag.  Secondly, she needs to share them equally among 5 of her friends.  Therefore, each friend will receive 6 pencils (32/5 = 6).  Finally, we are asked if Jessica has enough pencils for all five friends. Based on our calculation, yes, Jessica does have enough pencils for all five friends (32 pencils / 5 friends = 6 pencils per friend). So, the answer is 6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 34 cards in her hand.  Secondly, she needs to draw 5 more cards from the deck to make up for the missing card. Therefore, the total number of cards Jessica will have after drawing 5 new cards is:  34 + 5 = 39 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 30 pencils in her bag.  Secondly, she gave 5 of them to her friend.  Finally, we are asked how many pencils does she have left. So, the answer is 25 (30 - 5 = 25).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 30 coins in total.  Secondly, she gives 12 coins to her friend Sokun.  Finally, we are asked how many coins Sokun has after receiving those coins from Jessica. So, the answer is 12 + 12 = 24 coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 16 cards and she draws one card at a time. Therefore, there are 16 possible outcomes for each round of drawing.  Secondly, after each round of drawing, the probability of getting a heart remains constant at $ \frac{1}{3} $. So, the probability of getting a heart in the next round is $\frac{1}{3}$.  Thirdly, since there are 8 rounds of drawing in total, the expected number of hearts obtained by Jessica is $\frac{1}{3}$ multiplied by $8$, which gives us $\boxed{\text{42}}$.  Finally, to find the actual number of hearts obtained by Jessica, we add the number of hearts obtained in each round, which is $\boxed{\text{42}}$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 12 friends and she gave each of them 3 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of chocolates given by Jessica is 12 x 3 = 36.  Next, we are asked how many chocolates each friend received from Jessica. Since there are 8 friends in total who received chocolates from Jessica, the number of chocolates each friend received is 8 / 12 = 0.67 (or approximately 7 chocolates).  Finally, we are asked how many chocolates were left after Jessica gave them away. Since Jessica had 36 chocolates initially and gave away 7, the number of chocolates left after giving them away is 36 - 7 = 29.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 5 cards in her hand and she draws one card from the deck. So, there are now 4 cards left in the deck. Then, she discards one of her cards to the ghost, so there are now 3 cards left in her hand. Next, she draws another card from the deck, which means there are now 2 cards left in the deck. Finally, she discards one more card to the ghost, leaving none in her hand or in the deck. Therefore, the number of cards left in the deck after all these actions is 0 (zero).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 3 cards in her hand and she draws another card from the deck. So, there are now 4 cards in her hand.  Next, we know that she discards one of the cards from her hand to the discard pile. Therefore, there are only 3 cards left in her hand.  Finally, we know that she takes two more cards from the deck and adds them to her hand. So, there are now 5 cards in her hand.  Based on these calculations, the number of cards Jessica has in her hand at the end is 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has been studying English for 3 years and she is now in her final year of high school.  Secondly, we are told that she has passed all her exams with good grades except for one subject which is math.

Finally, we see that she has tried different methods such as watching videos, reading books, and taking online courses but still struggles with math. Based on these pieces of information, I would say that Jessica's current level of proficiency in math is around 60-70% (or B+/A-).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 34 cards in her hand and she draws one card from the deck. Therefore, there are 35 cards left in the deck after Jessica drew her card.  Next, we know that the total number of cards in the deck is 91, so the remaining cards in the deck after Jessica drew her card are 91 - 35 = 56 cards.  Finally, we know that there are 14 hearts in the deck, so the number of hearts left in the deck after Jessica drew her card is 14 / 56 = 0.25 or 1/4.  So, the answer to the question is 1/4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 12 friends and she gave each of them 3 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of chocolates given by Jessica is 12 x 3 = 36.  Next, we are asked how many chocolates each friend received from Jessica. Since there were 36 chocolates in total, and each friend received 3 chocolates, then the number of chocolates each friend received is 36 / 12 = 3 chocolates per friend.  So, the answer to the question is 3 chocolates per friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 4 cards in her hand and she draws one card from the deck. So, there are now 52 - 1 = 51 cards left in the deck.  Next, we know that the drawn card is a heart, so there are now 3 hearts remaining in the deck.  Finally, we know that Jessica has won the game, so there are no more turns to be taken after hers. Therefore, the number of cards left in the deck at the end of the game is 51 - 3 = 48 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 8 balls and she gives 3 of them to her friend. So, now Jessica has 8 - 3 = 5 balls left.  Next, we are told that her friend has 4 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls they have between them is 5 + 4 = 9 balls.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 12 balls in total (balls 1-12).  Then, he loses 3 balls (balls 4-6 and ball 8) so he has remaining balls = 12 - 3 = 9 balls left. Finally, he finds 5 more balls (balls 13-17), so his new total number of balls is 9 + 5 = 14 balls. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 years old and he is currently working as an engineer in a company. He wants to save money for his future life. So, he decides to invest $300 per month into a savings account with an interest rate of 5% per year. How much money will Danny have after 20 years if he continues to invest $300 per month without stopping? To calculate this, we can use the formula: Total amount = Initial amount x (1 + Interest rate)^Number of years. In this case, the initial amount is $0 (since Danny already has some money saved), the interest rate is 5%, and the number of years is 20. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: Total amount = $0 x (1 + 0.05)^20 = $64,798.80. Therefore, after 20 years, Danny will have $64,798.80 if he continues to invest $300 per month without stopping.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 32 cards in his deck and he draws one card at a time from the deck.  Therefore, the probability of drawing an Ace is 1/32.  Next, we are asked to find the probability of drawing a King after drawing an Ace. Since there are only four Kings in the deck (King, Queen, Jack, and Joker), the probability of drawing a King after drawing an Ace is 4/32 = 1/8.  Finally, we need to find the probability of drawing a King or an Ace. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of drawing each event separately, i.e., 1/8 + 1/32 = 9/32.  So, the answer is 9/32.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 36 cards in his deck and he draws one card at a time.  Therefore, after drawing 20 cards, he will have 36 - 20 = 16 cards left in his deck.  Secondly, we are asked how many cards Danny can draw before running out of cards. Since there are 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards, Danny can draw up to 52 / 36 = 1.47 times the number of cards he has left in his deck (in this case, 16). So, Danny can draw approximately 16 x 1.47 = 23 cards before running out of cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 12 balls in total (3 red, 4 blue, and 5 yellow).  Secondly, he gives 2 balls to his friend (1 red and 1 blue), so now he has 9 balls left (3 red, 4 blue, and 2 yellow). Thirdly, he loses 2 balls (1 red and 1 blue) while playing with his friends, so now he has 7 balls left (2 red, 3 blue, and 2 yellow). Finally, he finds 2 new balls (1 red and 1 blue), so now he has 9 balls again (3 red, 4 blue, and 2 yellow). Therefore, the number of balls Danny has at the end is 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 16 cards in his hand and he wants to discard 3 of them. So, the number of cards he will have left after discarding is 16 - 3 = 13.  Next, we are asked how many cards Danny has in total. We can calculate this by adding the number of cards he has left after discarding (13) to the initial number of cards he had (18). Therefore, the total number of cards Danny has is 13 + 18 = 31. Finally, we are asked how many cards Danny has of each suit. To find out, we need to divide the total number of cards he has by the number of suits (4). So, the number of cards Danny has of each suit is 31 / 4 = 7-8 cards per suit.
Response:  We know that Jake has 17 years old and Steven is older than him. So, we can assume that Steven is at least 18 years old (since he is older than Jake). Therefore, the difference between their ages is at most 1 year (since Steven is older than Jake by at least 1 year).  Hence, the answer is 18.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 friends: Steven, Jill, and himself (Jake). So, the total number of people he knows is 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 friends and he is older than Steven who has 13 friends. So, Jake must be at least 18 + 13 = 31 years old.  Now we need to find out how many more friends Jill has than Jake. According to the question, Jill has 18 friends, which is equal to Jake's number of friends plus 1 (since Jake already has 18 friends). Therefore, Jill has 19 friends in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 friends: Steven, Sarah, and Emily.  We also know that Jake is older than Steven but younger than Jill. So, we can conclude that Jake is between 15 and 20 years old (inclusive). Now, let's consider the options given in the question:  Option A: Jake is older than Steven. This means that Jake is at least 16 years old (since Steven is 14 years old).  Option B: Jake is younger than Jill. This means that Jake is less than 18 years old (since Jill is 17 years old). Therefore, the correct answer is option B: Jake is younger than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 5 friends (Steven, Emily, Sarah, Jack, and Rachel).  Among them, he is closest to Steven, who has 2 friends (Jill and Tom). So, Jake is 3 steps away from Jill. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 friends - Steven, Jill, and himself (Jake). So, the total number of people he knows is 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, Jake knows 4 people.
Response:  We know that Jake has 5 friends (Steven, Emily, Sarah, Jack, and Rachel).  We also know that Jake is friends with Steven and Emily. So, there are 3 people left who Jake is not friends with. Therefore, the probability of Jake being friends with any one of them is 1/3. Now, let's calculate the probability of Jake being friends with each of these 3 people separately:  Probability of Jake being friends with Steven = 1/3  Probability of Jake being friends with Emily = 1/3  Probability of Jake being friends with Jack or Rachel = 0 (since we know that Jake is not friends with either of them)  Therefore, the total probability of Jake being friends with any one of these 3 people is:  (1/3) + (1/3) + (0) = 2/3  So, the probability of Jake being friends with any one of these 3 people is 2/3.  As for the second part of the question, since Jake is friends with only 3 out of the 5 people mentioned (Steven, Emily, and Sarah), the probability of him being friends with any one of them is again 2/5.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 friends and he is older than Steven. So, Jake must have more friends than Steven.  Now, let's count how many friends each of them has:  Jake has 8 friends, so his total number of friends is 8.  Steven has 13 friends, so his total number of friends is 13.  Therefore, the difference between their numbers of friends is: 8 - 13 = -5.  So, Steven does not have as many friends as Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 friends: Steven, Sarah, and Emily.  We also know that Jake is older than Steven. So, if Jake is 18 years old, then Steven must be younger than 18 years old.  Now, let's count how many friends Jake has:  Jake - 3 friends = 2 friends left (Steven and one other friend).  Since Jake is older than Steven, we can conclude that Jake has 2 friends who are older than him: Steven and Emily. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many friends does Jake have?"" is 2."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 5 friends, including himself and Steven.  Secondly, we know that Jill has 18 friends, including herself and Jake. Thirdly, we are asked how many friends Jake has in total, including both his direct friends (Steven) and indirect friends (Jill). Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  We know that Jake has 10 friends and he gave each of them 3 chocolates. So, the total number of chocolates given by Jake is 10 x 3 = 30. Now, we are asked how many chocolates Jill received from Jake. Since Jill received 12 chocolates, the answer is 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 friends and Steven has 79 friends. So, if we want to find out how many more friends Jake has than Steven, we need to subtract the number of friends Jake has from the number of friends Steven has. Therefore, the difference between Jake's and Steven's number of friends is:  12 - 79 = -67  So, Jake has 67 fewer friends than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 cards and Steven has 3 cards. So, the total number of cards Jake has is 13 + 3 = 16. Now, we are asked how many cards Jake has more than Steven. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of cards Steven has (9) from the total number of cards Jake has (16). Therefore, Jake has 7 more cards than Steven.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 friends and each of them can bring either 1 or 2 guests. So, the total number of people who will attend the party is:

6 (friends of Jake) x 1 (guest per friend) = 6
+ 6 (friends of Jake) x 2 (guests per friend) = 12
= Total number of people attending the party

Now, we are asked how many people will be there if Steven brings his 10 friends to the party. Since each of Steven's friends can bring either 1 or 2 guests, the total number of people who will attend the party is:

10 (friends of Steven) x 1 (guest per friend) = 10
+ 10 (friends of Steven) x 2 (guests per friend) = 20
= Total number of people attending the party

Therefore, the answer is 20."
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 apples and wants to share them equally among his friends. So, he will have 3/4 of an apple per friend. Now, we need to find out how many friends Jake has. According to the question, Jake has 10 friends. Therefore, Jake will have 3/4 x 10 = 7.5 apples left after sharing them with all his friends. However, since you cannot have a half of an apple, Jake will have 8 apples left.
Response:  We know that there are 12 pencils in total (Jake has 4 and Steven has 8). So, we need to find out how many pencils Jake has after giving some to Steven. From the problem statement, we know that Jake gave 3 pencils to Steven. Therefore, the number of pencils Jake has left is: 4 - 3 = 1.  So, Jake has 1 pencil left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has more than one friend (Steven and Jill). So, there are at least two friends of Jake.  Secondly, we know that Jill has more than one friend (Jake and Steven). So, there are at least three friends of Jill. Therefore, the total number of friends of Jake is 2 + 3 = 5.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than Steven and less than Jill. So, Jake's number must be between 18 and 32. Since Jake is not equal to either of them, his number must be odd. Therefore, Jake's number is 19.
Response:  We know that Jake has 4 friends - Steven, Sarah, Emily, and Jack.  So, the total number of people Jake knows is 4.  Now, we are asked how many more friends Jake has than Jill.  Since Jill only has 3 friends (Sarah, Emily, and Jack), Jake has more friends than Jill by 1 person (Steven). Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 pencils and gives 10 to Steven. So, Jake now has 74 pencils left (84 - 10 = 74).  Then, we are told that Steven has 13 pencils more than Jake. Therefore, Steven has 87 pencils in total (74 + 13 = 87).  Finally, we are asked how many pencils Jake has after giving some to Steven. Since Jake gave 10 pencils to Steven, Jake now has 64 pencils left (74 - 10 = 64).
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 friends and Steven has 17 friends. So, if we want to find out how many friends Jake has more than Steven, we need to subtract the number of friends Steven has from the number of friends Jake has. Therefore, the difference between Jake's number of friends and Steven's number of friends is:  13 - 17 = -4  So, Jake has 4 fewer friends than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 friends and each of them can bring 3 guests, so in total, Jake has invited 8 x 3 = 24 people to his party. Now, we need to find out how many people have brought their own guests. From the information given, we know that Steven has brought 10 guests, which means he has 10 - 3 = 7 extra guests compared to Jake. So, the total number of people who have brought their own guests is: 7 + 24 = 31 people. Therefore, there are 31 people who have brought their own guests to Jake's party.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 apples and wants to share them equally among 4 people, including himself. So, each person will get $\frac{3}{4}$ of an apple. Now, let's calculate how many apples Steven will get. Since he is one of the 4 people, he will also get $\frac{3}{4}$ of an apple, which is equal to $\frac{3}{4} \times 1 = 1$ apple. Therefore, the final answer is $Jake$ has $3$ apples and wants to share them equally among $4$ people, including himself, so each person gets $\frac{3}{4}$ of an apple, and Steven gets $1$ apple.
Response:  We know that there are 38 students in total and they have to divide into groups of 4 or 5 people each. So, we need to find out how many different ways can we group them.  To do this, we use combinatorics. The number of ways to choose 4 or 5 people from 38 is given by C(38, 4) = 276 and C(38, 5) = 1096 respectively. Therefore, the total number of different ways to group the students is: 276 + 1096 = 1372.
Response:  We know that there are 78 balls in total and we want to divide them equally among 33 people. So, each person will get 2 balls per person. Now, let's calculate the number of balls each person will have if they are divided equally among 10 people instead of 33 people. If we divide 78 balls into 10 equal parts, each part will contain 7.8 balls (since 78 / 10 = 7.8). Therefore, if we divide the remaining 45 balls (which is equivalent to 33 - 10) among 10 people, each person will receive 4.5 balls (since 45 / 10 = 4.5).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of times the girl used her ATM card was 148.  Secondly, she withdrew $100 each time, so the total amount of money she withdrew is $148 x 100 = $14,800.  Finally, we are asked how much money the girl had in her account before she started using her ATM card. Based on the information provided earlier, the girl had $15,000 in her account initially. Therefore, after withdrawing $14,800, her remaining balance would be $15,000 - $14,800 = $200.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 108 ATMs in total and each ATM has 49 slots for withdrawal. So, the total number of slots available for withdrawal is 108 x 49 = 5260. Now, let's assume that the bank manager has already withdrawn $49 from each slot, leaving only $1 behind. Therefore, the total amount of money left in all the slots is 5260 x ($1) = $5260.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of withdrawals made from an ATM is 80. Then, we are asked how many times the account holder has used their card to withdraw money from the ATM in the past 3 months. Based on the information provided earlier, the account holder has withdrawn money 80 times from the ATM in the past 3 months. Therefore, the answer is 80.
Response:  We know that there are 30 students in total and they are divided into two groups of 15 each.  So, the number of students who will be selected for the competition is 15 x 2 = 30. Therefore, the answer is 30.
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we calculate the number of hours in a year, it will be: 365 x 24 = 8760 hours/year Now, let's find out how many hours she spent studying per day: 54 hours / 8760 hours = 0.061 years (or approximately 61 days) Therefore, based on this calculation, the girl studied for approximately 61 days non-stop without any break.
Response:  We know that there are 38 students in total and they have to share their scores among themselves equally. So, we can start by dividing the total score of 120 by the number of students, which is 38. This gives us an average score per student of 3.16 (rounded). Now, let's assume that each student has scored between 0 and 10 points. Since there are 38 students, the range of possible scores is from 0 x 38 = 0 to 10 x 38 = 380. Therefore, the probability that any one student gets a score above 3.16 is (380 - 0) / (380 + 0) = 379/380 = 0.985 or approximately 0.99.
Response:  We know that Dave has 19 years old and he is currently in grade 7.  If we assume that each year of schooling takes approximately 6 months (which is a rough estimate), then Dave has spent about 114 months (or almost 9.5 years) in elementary school so far. Therefore, if he continues to study at the same rate until he graduates from high school, he will have studied for approximately 208 months (or about 17.3 years). So, the answer is 17.
"Response:  If there are 18 rows of teeth and each row has 5 teeth, then the total number of teeth is:

18 x 5 = 90 teeth

So, there are 90 teeth in total."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed the examination. According to the question, there are 100 students in the class and all of them passed the examination, so the total number of passing students is 100.  Next, we need to find out how many students got A grade. From the question, we know that 20 students got A grade, which means that the ratio of students getting A grade to total passing students is 20/100 = 0.2 or 20%.  Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of students who did not get any grade (A, B, C, D, or F). To do this, we will subtract the number of students getting A grade from the total number of passing students, which gives us 80 students (100 - 20). Then, we divide the number of students who did not get any grade by the total number of passing students, which gives us 80/100 = 0.8 or 80%. Therefore, the answer is 80%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has 24 hours in a day.  Secondly, he has been working for 8 hours per day, which means he has worked for 1/3 of his daily time (24 hours / 8 hours = 3).  Finally, we are asked how many days he has worked, and since there are 7 days in a week, Dave has worked for 3 x 7 = 21 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 people in total (including the speaker). Then, we need to find out how many of them have been vaccinated. According to the information provided, 8 people have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and among them, 5 people have completed their full vaccination course. Therefore, the number of people who have been fully vaccinated is 5. Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated compared to the total number of people in the group. We can do this by dividing the number of fully vaccinated people by the total number of people in the group, which is 16 in this case. So, the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated is 5/16 = 0.3125 or 31.25%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has 16 questions and 77 answers.  Secondly, he wants to know how many times his answers are repeated in his questions. Thirdly, we calculate the number of unique answers by subtracting the repeated answers from the total number of answers. Finally, we divide the number of unique answers by the total number of questions to get the average number of unique answers per question. Therefore, the answer is:  Average number of unique answers per question = (Number of unique answers - Repeated answers) / Total number of questions = (77 - 16) / 103 = 0.74 or approximately 3/4.
Response:  We know that there are 17 questions and 21 options for each question. So, in total, there are 17 x 21 = 367 possible answers. However, we also know that some of these answers may be repeated or similar, so let's assume that there are actually only 365 unique answers (since 2 answers are the same). Therefore, the probability of getting any particular answer is 365/367, or approximately 0.984.
Response:  We know that there are 15 questions and 24 options for each question. So, in total, there are 15 x 24 = 360 options. Now, we need to find out how many of these options have been selected correctly. From the given information, we know that Dave has answered 21 questions correctly and incorrectly answered 4 questions. Therefore, the number of correct answers is 21, and the number of incorrect answers is 4. So, the final score is 21 / 360 = 0.0611 (approximately).
"Response:  We know that there are 19 people in total and they have to divide into groups of 4 or fewer people.  So, we need to find out how many ways this can be done.  There are 3 choices for each person (Dave, John, Sarah) so the number of ways is:

$$ \frac{3!}{2!} = 6 $$

Now, let's count the number of ways to choose the leader among the remaining 15 people:

There are $ 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times... \times 7$ ways to choose the leader since there are $ 15 $ people left after Dave, John, and Sarah are removed from the group.

So, the final answer is:

$$ 6 \times 15 = 90 $$

Therefore, there are 90 possible ways to divide 19 people into groups of 4 or fewer people with one leader chosen from the remaining 15 people."
Response:  We know that Dave has 18 teeth and he wants to brush them all at once. So, we need to divide 18 by the number of times he can brush his teeth in one minute.  According to the American Dental Association (ADA), an average person can brush their teeth for 2 minutes per session. Therefore, Dave can brush his teeth for 36 seconds per tooth (18 teeth x 2 minutes).  Hence, Dave needs to brush his teeth for 648 seconds (36 seconds/tooth x 18 teeth) to clean all of them thoroughly.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of images that can be stored in the phone's gallery app. The question states that there are 12 photos and 30 videos in the album, so the total number of images is: 12 + 30 = 42 images.  Therefore, the answer is 42.
Response:  We know that Dave has 24 files and he wants to compress them into 3 groups of 8 files each. So, we need to divide 24 files equally among 3 groups, which means each group will have 8 files. Now, let's count how many files Dave can compress in total: Group 1 (8 files), Group 2 (8 files), and Group 3 (8 files). Therefore, the number of compressed files is 8 + 8 + 8 = 24.
"Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. So, if we multiply 24 x 7 = 168 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Dave has worked based on his statement: ""I have been working for 3 years and 4 months.""  If we assume that he works 8 hours per day (which is a common assumption), then he has worked for: 3 years x 8 hours/day = 2400 hours + 4 months x 8 hours/day = 160 hours Total hours worked = 2560 hours Therefore, Dave has worked for approximately 2560 hours over the past 3 years and 4 months."
Response:  We know that there are 11 people in the group and they have 3 bags of rice each, so the total number of bags of rice is 11 x 3 = 33 bags.  However, we also know that one person has 24 bags of rice, which means that there are 33 - 24 = 9 extra bags of rice left over after everyone has received their share.  Therefore, the answer is 9 bags of rice.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. So, if Nell has been working for 3 years, she would have worked for 8,640 hours (24 x 3 x 7). Now, let's calculate how many hours Jeff has worked. According to the question, Jeff has worked for 13 years, which means he has worked for 52 weeks per year (on average) x 40 hours/week = 2,080 hours/year. Therefore, Jeff has worked for 13 x 2,080 = 27,440 hours during his 13-year work experience. Finally, we need to subtract the total number of hours worked by both Nell and Jeff from their combined age. Based on the question, Nell is 30 years old + 24 years = 54 years old, and Jeff is 40 years old + 13 years = 53 years old. So, the difference between their ages is 54 - 53 = 1 year. Hence, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Jeff has 301 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his friends. Since there are 5 of them, each friend will get 60 balls (301 / 5 = 60). Now, let's check if Nell got any ball from Jeff. According to the question, Nell received 154 balls from someone else, so she didn't receive any ball from Jeff. Therefore, the final answer is:  Nell did not get any ball from Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell has 528 coins and Jeff has 11 coins. To find out how many coins Jeff has in total, we multiply the number of coins he has by 252 (the difference between the number of coins Nell has and the number of coins Jeff has). So, Jeff has 2740 coins in total.
Response:  According to the question, Nell has 535 cards in her deck and she wants to give some of them to Jeff.  Since each card has a number on it, we can assume that there are at least 535 numbers on the cards (since we don't know if there are any blank cards).  Therefore, the total number of numbers on all the cards is at least 535 x 100 = 53,500.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell has 308 bags of rice and 149 bags of sugar.  Secondly, we are asked how many bags of rice and sugar does she have in total.  Therefore, to find out the total number of bags of rice and sugar, we need to add the number of bags of each type together.  So, the total number of bags of rice is 308 + 149 = 457 bags. Similarly, the total number of bags of sugar is also 308 + 149 = 457 bags.  Hence, Nell has 457 bags of rice and 457 bags of sugar in total.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that:  * Nell has 24 dogs (not cats).  * Each dog has 3 kittens (not puppies).  Therefore, the total number of kittens Nell has is:  24 x 3 = 72 kittens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell has 365 days in her calendar. Secondly, she gave 210 days to John and kept 155 days for herself. Finally, we need to subtract the number of days given to John from the total number of days in her calendar to find out how many days are left for Nell. Therefore, the answer is 155 days.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that:  * Nell has 43 cats and dogs.  * She wants to give each of them a treat that is worth $10.  Therefore, the total amount she needs to spend is:  $43 x $10 = $430.  So, Nell needs to spend $430 on treats for her pets.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

Nell has 376 cats and 10 dogs.
Jeff has 111 cats and 10 dogs.
The total number of cats is 487 (376 + 111).
The total number of dogs is 20 (10 + 10).
So, the total number of pets Nell has is 487 + 20 = 507 pets."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between January 18th and March 20th. There are 45 days between these two dates. Now, let's calculate the number of days that have passed since February 27th. Since February 27th is in the middle of this period (January 18th - March 20th), there are 43 days that have passed since February 27th. Therefore, the answer is 43 days.
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in February and 7 days in a week. So, if we subtract 7 days from 28 days, we get 21 days left. Now, let's calculate how many weeks are left after deducting 7 days from 21 days. There are 3 weeks left. Therefore, the answer is 3 weeks.
Response:  We know that $40$ is divided into two parts: $20$ and $20$. So, we have $\frac{40}{2} = 20$. Now, we need to find out how many times $20$ can be divided into $38$. We know that $38$ is divisible by $7$, so we can divide $38$ by $7$: $38 \div 7 = 5$. Therefore, we have $\frac{20}{5} = 4$. So, there are $4$ groups of $20$ each in $40$ dollars.
Response:  We know that there are 25 days in April and 5 days in May. So, if we want to find out how many days have passed since April 25th, we need to subtract 5 days from 25 days. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since April 25th is 20 days (25 - 5 = 20).

We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the word ""ព្រឹក"". There are 7 letters in total: p, r, e, o, k, c, and h. So, the word ""ព្រឹក"" appears 7 times in the text. Finally, we need to add up the number of times both words appear in the text: 5 + 7 = 12. Therefore, the answer is 12."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last time the user visited the website. According to the question, the last visit was 16 weeks ago. Therefore, the number of days that have passed is: 16 weeks x 7 days/week = 112 days. Next, we need to calculate the total number of cookies that were stored in the browser cache at the time of the last visit. According to the question, there were 21 cookies stored in the browser cache at the time of the last visit. Finally, we need to determine whether any new cookies have been added or removed since the last visit. The question states that no new cookies have been added or removed. Therefore, the current number of cookies in the browser cache is equal to the number of cookies stored at the time of the last visit, which is 21 cookies.
Response:  We know that Paco has $22 and gives away $15 to his friend. So, he now has $22 - $15 = $7 remaining. Then, he spends another $54 on something else. Therefore, his new balance is $7 + $54 = $61.
Response:  We know that Paco has 9 pairs of shoes and he wants to give 6 pairs to his friend. So, we need to find out how many shoes are left for him after giving them away.  The total number of shoes Paco has is 9 x 2 = 18.  If he gives 6 pairs to his friend, then the remaining shoes for him will be 18 - 6 = 12.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco has 37 cookies and wants to share them equally among 11 friends. So, each friend will get 37/11 = 3 cookies per person. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We are asked how many cookies each friend will get if they are given an equal number of cookies as before but with a total of 150 cookies instead of 37. In this case, each friend will get (150/11) = 13.6364 cookies. Since we can't give fractional cookies, each friend will get 13 whole cookies in total. Therefore, the final answer is:  Friends will get 3 cookies each from Paco initially, and 13 whole cookies each after the additional 150 cookies are added.
Response:  We know that Paco has 8 big cookies and 6 small cookies.  If he eats 20 of them, then he will have 8 - 20 = 6 big cookies left and 6 + 34 = 40 small cookies left. So, the total number of cookies he will have after eating 20 is 6 + 40 = 46 cookies.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""ប៉ាកូ"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each word in the text using the following formula:

Number of occurrences = Total number of words - Number of unique words

In this case, there are 36 words in the text, and 5 of them are ""ប៉ាកូ"". Therefore, the number of occurrences of ""ប៉ាកូ"" is:

Number of occurrences = 36 - 5 = 31

Now, let's count the number of times ""ប៉ាកូ"" appears after the phrase ""ប៉ាកូ បានបរិភោគគីគី"":

First occurrence: ប៉ាកូ បានបរិភោគគី (1)
Second occurrence: ប៉ាកូ បានបរិភោគគី (2)
Third occurrence: ប៉ាកូ បានបរិភោគគី (3)
Fourth occurrence: ប៉ាកូ បានបរិភោគគី (4)

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Number of times ""ប៉ាកូ"" appears after the phrase ""ប��"
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: March 20, 1975 - February 28, 1976 = 365 days  Therefore, there are 365 days between these two dates.  Next, we need to calculate how many times the number of days between the two dates fits into the number of years given in the question.  Number of years given in the question: 36 years  Now, let's divide the number of years by the number of days between the two dates: 36 years / 365 days = approximately 101 times  So, based on the calculation above, the answer is approximately 101 times.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last time the person had breakfast. According to the question, it has been 9 hours since the person had breakfast. Therefore, the number of days that have passed is:  9 / 24 = 0.375 days (approximately)    Next, we need to calculate the number of times the person has eaten lunch today. According to the question, the person has eaten lunch 4 times today. Therefore, the total number of meals the person has eaten today is:  4 \* 1 = 4 meals   Finally, we need to determine whether the person has eaten dinner yet today. According to the question, the person has not eaten dinner yet today. Therefore, the answer is:  0 (the person has not eaten dinner yet today)
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""cookies"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of the term ""cookies"" in the text. Based on the provided text, the term ""cookies"" appears 3 times. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  We know that Paco has $97 and gives away $34 to his friend. So he has $63 left. Then, he spends $15 on something and has $48 left. Finally, he spends another $56 on something else and has $0 left. Therefore, the amount of money that Paco has after giving away some money and buying something is $0.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of years that Paco has been working as an engineer. According to the question, he started work in 1985 and stopped in 2003, so the total number of years is:  1985 - 2003 = 18 years.  Next, we need to calculate the number of projects that Paco worked on during his career as an engineer. The question states that he worked on 46 projects, but does not provide the time period over which these projects were completed. However, based on the information provided earlier, we can assume that these projects were completed during the 18 years that Paco was working as an engineer. Therefore, the number of projects that Paco worked on is:  46 projects x 18 years = 832 projects.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco has 39 years old and his wife is 6 years older than him, so she is 45 years old.  Then, we are asked how many children they have. From the information given, we know that they have two children, aged 23 and 18 years old respectively. Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{2} $.
Response:  We know that Paco has 40 cookies and wants to share them equally among 25 friends. So, each friend will get 1 cookie.  Now, let's calculate how many cookies Paco can give to his other 13 friends who are not included in the initial distribution of 25 friends. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cookies given to the first 25 friends from the total number of cookies Paco has (40). Therefore, the remaining number of cookies after distributing them to the first 25 friends is: 40 - 25 = 15.  Since there are 13 friends left to be distributed, Paco can give each of them 1 cookie, which means he will have 15 cookies left for himself.  So, the final answer is: 15.

7 years + 4 months = 7 years \* 12 months/year = 84 months

Now, we need to calculate how many days Gwen has worked in total. There are 30 days in each month, so:

84 months \* 30 days/month = 2560 days

Therefore, Gwen has worked for 2560 days."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that Gwen has been working for 8 years and has taken 6 days off. So, the total number of workdays she has had is: 8 years x 365 days/year = 2970 days Worked  Since she took 6 days off, the total number of workdays she actually worked is: 2970 days - 6 days = 2964 days worked Therefore, the number of workweeks Gwen has worked is: 2964 days / 7 days/week = 410 weeks worked
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen has been to school for 2 years and she is now in grade 3. So, her age is 3 + 2 = 5 years old.  Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  According to the question, Gwen has been working for 8 years at her current job and has taken 4 months of maternity leave. So, the total time she has worked is: 8 years + 4 months = 8 years 6 months. Now, let's calculate how many days she has worked in those 8 years 6 months: 8 years x 12 months/year = 96 months 6 months (approximately) Therefore, Gwen has worked for approximately 96 months or 7 years and 9 months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen has been working at the company for 3 years and she has received 3 bonuses during this time.  Therefore, the total amount of money she has earned from her bonuses is $3 \times 3 = $9.  However, we are also told that Gwen has spent $4 on things related to her job, such as travel expenses and equipment.  So, the net amount of money Gwen has earned from her bonuses is $9 - $4 = $5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen has been working at the company for 5 years and she is currently in her mid-30s (not specified). Secondly, we are told that she has been able to save $800 per month through her retirement plan. Lastly, we are asked how much money Gwen will have saved after 10 years if she continues to save $800 per month. To calculate this, we need to use a formula that takes into account the compounding effect of interest over time. Specifically, we can use the formula: Savings = Principal x (1 + Interest Rate)^Years Where: Savings = the total amount of money saved Principal = the initial amount of money invested Interest Rate = the annual rate of return (in this case, it is not specified but let's assume it is around 7% per year) Years = the number of years the money is invested In this case, Gwen has been saving $800 per month for 5 years, so the principal amount is $40,000 ($800/month x 5 years). If she continues to save $800 per month for another 5 years, the total amount saved would be: Savings = $40,000 x (1 + 0.07)^10 = $64,297 After 10 years, Gwen will have saved a total of $64,297.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen has been given 5 chances to guess the password correctly. If she fails to do so after all 5 attempts, then the password is revealed and her attempt will be recorded as incorrect. Therefore, the number of incorrect attempts made by Gwen is 5. Now, let's consider the situation where Gwen manages to guess the password correctly after 2 attempts. In this case, she will have used up 3 attempts (2 correct attempts + 1 incorrect attempt). So, the total number of incorrect attempts made by Gwen is 5 - 3 = 2.
Response:  We know that Josh has 9 balls in his pocket and he wants to give one of them to his friend as a gift. So, if we want to find out how many balls are left for him after giving one ball to his friend, we can subtract 1 from the total number of balls he has (9) which gives us 8. Therefore, Josh has 8 balls left in his pocket after giving one ball to his friend.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Josh has 12 balls and he wants to distribute them equally among his friends. So, each friend will get how many balls?  To find out, let's divide 12 (the total number of balls) by the number of friends Josh wants to give balls to, which is 4 (based on the question).  Therefore, each friend will get 3 balls (12 / 4 = 3).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Josh has 19 years of experience working as an engineer and he is currently working at a company called XYZ Inc. We also know that he has been promoted to a manager position after working for 10 years at the same company. Therefore, we can calculate his total work experience as follows:  Total work experience = 19 years + 10 years (time spent as an engineer) = 29 years Now, let's assume that Josh started working at XYZ Inc when he was 25 years old. So, his age now would be 44 years old (25 + 19). Finally, based on the information provided in the question, we know that Josh has been promoted to a manager position after working for 10 years at the same company. Therefore, we can conclude that he has worked as an engineer for 14 years (25 - 10 = 15 years).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of times ""Josh"" mentioned in the passage. We can see that ""Josh"" is mentioned four times in the passage:  Josh said... (line 1), Josh did... (line 2), Josh had... (line 3), and Josh wanted... (line 4). Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  We know that Josh has 7 balls in his pocket and he throws them all at once.  Each ball represents one of the 10 questions asked to him. So, we have 7 x 10 = 70 possible outcomes or answers for each question. Therefore, the total number of possibilities is 70^10 = 490,523,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh has 20 balls in his bag.  Secondly, he wants to give some of them away as gifts. Finally, he decides to give 5 balls to each of his friends. Therefore, the number of balls left with Josh after giving them away is: $ 20 - (5 \times 3) = 10$ balls. So, there are 10 balls left with Josh after giving them away.
Response:  We know that Josh has 20 marbles in his pocket and he gives 4 of them to Jack. So, after giving the marbles to Jack, Josh has 16 marbles left (20 - 4 = 16). Now we are asked how many marbles Josh has in total. To find out, we need to add the number of marbles he had before giving any to Jack (16) with the number of marbles he gave to Jack (4), which gives us a total of 20 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh has 22 marbles in total.  Then, Jack took away 5 marbles from Josh, so now Josh has 17 marbles left (22 - 5 = 17).  Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  We know that Josh has 19 balls in his bag.  Now we want to find out how many of them are red. So, if Josh has 19 balls and 5 of them are red, then the number of red balls is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Josh has 22 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of balls.  We also know that there are 5 friends in total.  Therefore, if Josh divides the 22 balls equally among his friends, each friend will get:

Number of balls per friend = Total number of balls / Number of friends
= 22 / 5
= 4.4 balls per friend (round down to nearest whole number)
So, Josh can give 4 balls to each of his 5 friends."
Response:  We know that Josh has 15 balls in his bag and he gave 9 of them to his friend. So, the number of balls left with Josh is 6 (15 - 9 = 6). Now, we are asked how many more balls Josh's friend has than Josh. Since Josh's friend has 23 balls and Josh has 6 balls left, we can say that Josh's friend has 17 more balls than Josh (23 - 6 = 17). Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  We know that Josh has 3 balls in his pocket and he gives 2 of them to his friend. So, now Josh has 1 ball left in his pocket.  Next, we are told that Josh's friend has 5 balls in total, including the 2 balls that Josh gave him. Therefore, the number of balls that Josh's friend has is 5 + 2 = 7 balls.  Finally, we are asked how many balls Josh's friend has in total after receiving all 6 balls from Josh. Since Josh's friend already had 7 balls, and then received 6 more balls from Josh, the total number of balls that Josh's friend has now is 7 + 6 = 13 balls.
Response:  We know that Marco has 19 years old and he is studying at university. He wants to know how many times his age will be multiplied by the number of years he studies at university. So, we need to calculate (19 x 4) = 76. Therefore, Marco will have $76 in total after studying for 4 years at university.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has 36 hairs on his head.  Secondly, we are asked how many hairs he will have after shaving them all off. Therefore, the answer is 0 hairs.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""ម៉ាកកូ"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each word in the text using the following formula:

Number of occurrences = Total number of words - Number of unique words

In this case, there are 105 words in the text, and after removing stopwords (such as ""the"", ""a"", etc.), we have 87 unique words. Therefore, the number of occurrences of ""ម៉ាកកូ"" is:

Number of occurrences = 105 - 87 = 18

Now, let's count the number of times ""អត្ថបទ"" appears in the text:

Number of occurrences = 24

Finally, we need to multiply the number of occurrences of ""ម៉ាកកូ"" by the number of occurrences of ""អត្ថបទ"":

Product = 18 x 24 = 432

Therefore, the answer to the question is 432."
Response:  The question asks about the number of people who have been to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.  To find out, we need to know how many people have visited these two cities.  According to the Cambodia Tourism Board, in 2019, there were approximately 6 million tourists who visited Phnom Penh, and around 2 million visitors went to Siem Reap. Therefore, the total number of people who have visited both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap is: 6,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 8,000,000 people.
Response:  We know that Marco has 8 cards in his hand and he draws one card from the deck. So, now he has 9 cards in his hand.  Next, we are asked how many cards Marco has in total after drawing three cards from the deck. Since there are 52 cards in a standard deck of cards, if Marco drew 3 cards, then he has a total of 52 + 3 = 55 cards in his possession. Therefore, the answer is 55.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has been to Cambodia and Vietnam before (Option A). Secondly, he wants to visit Thailand next (Option B). Thirdly, he has not visited Laos or Myanmar yet (Option C). Lastly, he has already seen Angkor Wat in Cambodia (Option D). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: He wants to visit Thailand next.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has 30 friends and each friend has an average of 3 children. Therefore, the total number of children is 30 x 3 = 90 children.  Next, we are asked how many children Marco has. Since he has no children himself, the answer is zero or 0. So, the final answer is 90 - 0 = 90 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has 16 kg of rice.  Secondly, we are asked how much rice he will have after giving 3 kg to his friend. Therefore, the amount of rice Marco will have left is: 16 kg - 3 kg = 13 kg. So, Marco will have 13 kg of rice left after giving 3 kg to his friend.
"Response:  Marco has 30 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his friends. If there are 17 friends, then each friend will get:

Number of balls per friend = Total number of balls / Number of friends
= 30 / 17
= 1.76 (approximately)
So, Marco's friends will get approximately 1.76 balls each."
Response:  Marco has 10 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of balls. Since there are 5 friends in total, each friend will get 2 balls (10 / 5 = 2). Now, let's consider how many balls Marco himself will have after giving away all his balls to his friends. If he gives away 26 balls (which is the total number of balls he has), then he will be left with zero balls (26 - 10 = 16). So, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Marco has 12 balls and he wants to give them equally among his friends. So, we need to divide 12 balls into 5 groups of equal size. To find out how many balls each group will have, we can use division. Division is when you divide one number by another to get a quotient (result) and remainder (amount left over). In this case, we are dividing 12 by 5, which gives us a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1. This means that each group of 5 friends will get 2 balls each, and there will be 1 ball left over for Marco. Therefore, the answer is 2 + 1 = 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in the classroom. Secondly, we know that each student has to take a test for 1 hour. Therefore, the total time required for all students to take the test is 20 x 60 = 1200 minutes. Finally, we know that the teacher has been grading papers for 4 hours. So, the remaining time after subtracting the time taken by the teacher to grade papers from the total time required for all students to take the test is 1200 - 4 = 1196 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in the classroom. Secondly, we know that 3 of them have finished their homework. Therefore, the number of students who haven't finished their homework is 20 - 3 = 17.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in total and they are divided into groups of 4. So, the number of groups is 20 / 4 = 5.  Next, each group has to take turns playing the game, so the number of times each student plays the game is 5 (groups) x 4 (students per group) = 20. Therefore, the total number of times each student plays the game is 20.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 people in total who have been infected with COVID-19 and are being treated at the hospital.  Among them, 2 people have recovered completely, leaving us with 2 infected patients remaining.  Therefore, the number of infected people left at the hospital is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 students in the classroom. Secondly, we know that each student has to take a test consisting of 18 questions. Thirdly, we know that each correct answer is worth 2 points. Finally, we want to find out how many points will be awarded if all the students get all the answers correct. So, let's calculate the total number of points as follows: Total number of points = Number of questions x Points per question x Percentage of correct answers Therefore, the total number of points for this case would be: Total number of points = 18 x 2 x 100% = 360 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in class A and they have to take a test. Secondly, we know that each student has to answer 10 questions. Thirdly, we know that there is one teacher who will grade their tests. Finally, we know that the teacher can grade up to 5 tests at a time. So, if all 20 students of class A take their test simultaneously, how many times will the teacher be able to grade tests during this period?  Solution: To calculate the number of times the teacher can grade tests, we need to divide the total number of tests (20 x 10 = 200) by the number of tests the teacher can grade at a time (5). Therefore, the teacher can grade tests 40 times (200 / 5 = 40) during this period.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 people in total who have been infected with COVID-19 at the moment (5). Next, we need to find out how many of them have recovered from the disease (recovered). According to the information provided earlier, 3 people have already recovered from COVID-19 (recovered = 3). Therefore, the number of people who are still sick or infected is equal to the total number of cases minus the number of recoveries (illnesses = Total Cases - Recovered). In this case, illnesses = 5 - 3 = 2. So, there are 2 people who are still sick or infected with COVID-19 at the moment.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 students in total and they have to take a test consisting of 12 questions.  Therefore, each student will have to answer 12/36 = 0.33 questions per person.  Since there are 4 options for each question, each student will have to choose one option from 4 = 0.25 options per question.  So, the number of options chosen by each student is 0.25 x 0.33 = 0.08 options.  Now, let's calculate the total number of options chosen by all 36 students together. The product of 0.08 options chosen by each student and the total number of students (36) gives us the total number of options chosen overall, which is 0.08 x 36 = 2.88 options.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 students in total who passed the examination and got their results. Among them, 30 students got A grade, which means they scored above 80%. Therefore, the number of students who got A grade is 30.  Next, we need to find out how many students got B grade. According to the question, among the remaining 10 students who did not get A grade, 7 students got C grade, which means they scored between 60% and 79%. So, the number of students who got B grade is 7.  Finally, we have 2 students who got D grade, which means they scored below 60%. Therefore, the total number of students who got different grades are as follows: A - 30, B - 7, and D - 2.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 students in total and they have to take a test consisting of 30 questions. Therefore, the number of questions each student has to answer is:

Number of questions per student = Total number of questions / Number of students
= 30 / 28
= 1.07 (approximately)

So, each student has to answer approximately 1.07 questions from the test."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 23 students in total, including the student who got injured (Question 1).  Since the student who got injured is not included in the count of 23 students, the number of students left after he/she got injured is 23 - 1 = 22 students.  Next, we are asked to find out how many students were absent from school that day (Question 2). Based on the information provided earlier, 4 students were absent from school that day. Therefore, the total number of students present at school that day is 22 + 4 = 26 students. Finally, we are asked to find out how many students passed the examination (Question 3). According to the information given, all 26 students present at school that day passed the examination. So, the answer to Question 3 is 26.
Response:  We know that there are 33 students in total and they have to share the cake equally among themselves. So, we can calculate the number of slices of cake each student will get as follows: Number of slices = Total number of students / Number of students per slice = 33 / 2 = 16.5 Now, since you cannot cut a cake into half or quarter pieces, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which is 17 slices of cake for all 33 students. Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  We know that there are 13 students in total and they have to share their lunch equally among themselves. So, we can start by dividing 64 (the number of lunches) by 13 (the number of students). This gives us an average of 5 lunches per student. Now, let's check if Mr. Baker has received any lunches. According to the question, he has not received any lunches yet. Therefore, the final answer is 0 lunches for Mr. Baker.
Response:  We know that the number of balls is 145 and there are 72 red balls in total. So, we can calculate the number of non-red balls as follows:  Number of non-red balls = Total number of balls - Number of red balls = 145 - 72  = 73  Therefore, Mr. Baker has thrown 73 balls.
"Response:  We know that there are 168 hours in a week and 4 weeks in a month. So, if we calculate the total number of days in a year, it will be:

168 hours/week x 7 days/week = 1201 hours/year

Now, let's convert this to minutes:

1201 hours/year x 60 minutes/hour = 72060 minutes/year

Finally, let's divide the total number of minutes by the number of minutes in a day (1440 minutes) to get the total number of days:

72060 minutes/year / 1440 minutes/day = 5003 days/year

So, the answer is 5003 days."
"Response:  We know that the number of balls given to Baker is 105 and he has returned 170 balls. So, we can calculate the difference between the two numbers as follows:

Difference = Returned balls - Given balls = 170 - 105 = 65

Therefore, the number of extra balls that Baker has kept for himself is 65."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 people in total - Baker, Cake and Customer.  Secondly, we know that Baker made the cake and gave it to the customer.  Finally, we know that the customer paid $10 for the cake.  Therefore, the answer is:  $10 / 3 = $3.33 per person.
Response:  The total number of candies in the jar is 108.  There are 31 candies that are left over after 78 candies have been eaten. So, the remaining number of candies = Total number of candies - Number of candies eaten = 108 - 31 = 77 candies. Therefore, Baker has 77 candies left in his bag.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of students in the class is 120 and they have to divide into groups of 4 people each. So, the total number of groups will be:

120 / 4 = 30 groups

Now, let's find out how many groups Mr. Baker can lead. We know that he has been teaching for 20 years, which means he has led 20 x 30 = 600 groups so far. Therefore, there are still 30 - 600 = 240 groups left for him to lead."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 44 students in total (including Baker).  Secondly, we know that each student has to take a test consisting of 50 questions (totaling 50 x 44 = 2200 questions). Lastly, we know that Baker did not attend any of the tests (so he didn't get any marks). Therefore, the final score for Baker is zero (0). So, the answer is 0.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""baker"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of appearances of the word ""baker"" in the text. Based on the provided text, we can see that the word ""baker"" appears twice - once in the phrase ""Baker 148"" and again in the phrase ""Bakers 80"". Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  We know that 7 weeks is equal to 49 days (since there are 7 days in a week). So, if we multiply 49 days by 3, we get 147 days. Now, let's add 147 days to 148 weeks, which gives us 295 weeks. Therefore, the answer is 295 weeks.
"Response:  The question is asking about the number of times the word ""baker"" appears in the text.  To find this out, we need to count the number of appearances of the word ""baker"" in the given text.  After counting, we found that the word ""baker"" appears 4 times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 4."
"Response:  The question asks about the number of times the word ""baker"" appears in the text. To find this out, we need to count the number of occurrences of the word ""baker"" in the given passage. Here is the passage again for reference:

""The baker had eight children and their names were Brian, Kevin, Jennifer, Lisa, Melissa, Sarah, Michael, and David.""

Let's start counting! There are two instances of the word ""baker"" in the passage:

1. ""The baker"" (occurs once)
2. ""their names were Brian, Kevin, Jennifer, Lisa, Melissa, Sarah, Michael, and David"" (occurs once)

So, there are two occurrences of the word ""baker"" in total. Therefore, the answer to the question is 2."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of letters in both names:  Mr. Baker - 10 letters Ms. Khmer - 9 letters Next, we need to find out how many vowels are there in each name:  Mr. Baker - A (2), E (2), I (1) Total = 5 Ms. Khmer - A (2), E (2), I (1) Total = 5 Now, we need to count the consonants in each name:  Mr. Baker - B (2), C (1), D (1), F (1), G (1), H (1), J (1), K (1), L (1), M (2), N (1), P (1), R (2), T (3), V (1), W (1) Total = 17 Ms. Khmer - C (1), D (1), G (1), H (1), J (1), K (1), L (1), M (1), N (1), P (1), S (1), T (1), V (1), Z (1) Total = 14 Finally, we add up the total number of consonants and vowels for each name:  Mr. Baker - Consonants: 17, Vowels: 5 Total = 22 Ms. Khmer - Consonants: 14, Vowels: 5 Total = 19 Therefore, the difference between the total number of consonants and vowels in Mr. Baker's name and Ms. Khmer's name is: 22 - 19 = 3 So, the answer is 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 365 days in a year (not including leap years). So, if someone has been working for 10 years, they have worked for 3650 days (10 x 365 = 3650). Now, let's calculate how many hours this person has worked. There are 24 hours in a day, so multiplying 3650 days by 24 hours per day gives us a total of 87,600 hours (3650 x 24 = 87600). Therefore, the answer is 87,600 hours.
"Response:  We know that there are 41 days in April and May combined (April has 30 days and May has 12 days). So, if Baker has been working for 48 hours per day (which is a reasonable assumption), then he would have worked for a total of:

$$ \text {Total hours worked} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Hours per day} $$

Substituting the values we know, we get:

$$ \text {Total hours worked} = 41 \times 48 = 1968 \text { hours} $$

So, Baker has worked for approximately 1968 hours during the period of time mentioned in the question."
Response:  We know that Mr. Baker has 8 balls and he wants to give them equally among his 4 friends. So, we need to divide 8 balls into 4 parts or groups. Each friend will get 2 balls each. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  The question asks about the number of times Baker has been to Cambodia.  We know that Baker has visited Cambodia 138 times.  So, the answer is 138.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mr. Baker has 33 years of experience in his field. Then, he was promoted to be the manager after working for 10 years as an engineer. Therefore, he had worked for a total of 43 years (33 + 10 = 43).
Response:  Firstly, we know that 88 people have been invited to the party and 16 of them are bakers. So, the number of cakes they can make is 88 / 16 = 5.375 (rounded off to 5). Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We know that 100 people have tasted the cakes and 32 of them liked them. So, the number of likes is 100 - 32 = 68. Therefore, the total number of likes and dislikes is 5 + 68 = 73.
Response:  The question asks about the number of cakes that Baker baked and sold. We are given two pieces of information to help us solve this problem:  Firstly, Baker baked 8 cakes in total. Secondly, out of these 8 cakes, 13 were sold. So, we need to find out how many cakes Baker did not sell. To do this, we subtract the number of cakes sold (13) from the total number of cakes baked (8):  Number of cakes not sold = Total number of cakes baked - Number of cakes sold = 8 - 13 = -5 Therefore, Baker did not sell any cakes.
Response:  We know that there are 20 questions in total and we have answered 8 of them correctly so far. Therefore, the number of remaining questions is: $ \text {Remaining questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Answered questions} = 20 - 8 = 12 $\$. Now, let's calculate the probability of answering each question correctly: $$ \text {Probability of answering correctly} = \frac{\text{Number of correct answers}}{\text{Total questions}} = \frac{8}{20} = 0.4 $$ So, the probability of answering question $ \# 144 $ correctly is: $$ \text {Probability of answering question } \# 144 \text{ correctly} = \frac{0.4}{12} = 0.033 \text{ or } 3.3\% $$
Response:  The question asks about the number of candles that were lit when Baker baked the cake. We know that Baker baked 46 cakes and each cake had 30 candles. Therefore, the total number of candles lit by Baker is: 46 x 30 = 1320 candles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that អ្នក (Baker) has made 420 loaves of bread in total. Then, we are asked how many loaves he has sold. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of loaves he has given away from the total number of loaves he has made. So, if he has given away 176 loaves, then he has sold 420 - 176 = 244 loaves of bread.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that អ្នក (Baker) has made 30 loaves of bread and sold them at $2 each. So, the total amount of money earned is:

$30 x 30 = $900

Now, let's calculate how much money he spent on ingredients for making those loaves of bread:

$15 x 30 = $450

So, the profit earned by Baker is:

Profit = Total Amount Earned - Total Amount Spent
= $900 - $450
= $450

Therefore, the answer to the question is $450."
Response:  We know that there are 10 people in total (including Baker).  Among them, 5 people have been to Phnom Penh (including Baker), and 3 people have been to Siem Reap. So, the number of people who have not been to either place is 2 (5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  The first number is 134 (the number of days since January 1st). Then we have to multiply it by 2 because there are two times in a day (morning and evening), so the result will be 268. Finally, we subtract 50 (the number of days since February 17th) from 268, which gives us 218 as the final answer. Therefore, the correct answer is 218.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 days in a week (Monday to Sunday).  Secondly, we know that Mr. Baker has worked for 30 years. Therefore, the total number of working days he has had is: 30 years x 7 days/week = 210 weeks Now, let's calculate how many hours he has worked during those 210 weeks: 210 weeks x 5 days/week = 1,050 hours Finally, let's convert those hours into minutes: 1,050 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 63,000 minutes So, to answer your question, Mr. Baker has worked for a total of 63,000 minutes as an accountant.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Kelly has 10 Nintendo games in total.  Secondly, she wants to sell them and make money from it. Thirdly, she is wondering how much she can get for each game. Finally, she asks if she can sell all of her games together and make $64. Based on these points, we can conclude that Kelly can sell each game for approximately $6.4 per unit ( $64 / 10 games).
Response:  According to the question, Kelly has been playing Super Mario Bros. for 81 hours non-stop. If we assume that each hour of gameplay is equivalent to one minute (60 seconds), then Kelly has played Super Mario Bros. for approximately 5,040 minutes (81 hours \* 60 seconds/hour). Therefore, the answer is 5,040.
Response:  According to the question, Kelly has 10 Nintendo games and 8 Sony games.  So, the total number of games she owns is 10 + 8 = 18 games.  Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  According to the question, Kelly has 42 Nintendo games and 133 Sony games. To find out how many total games she has, we can add the number of Nintendo and Sony games together: 42 + 133 = 175 games. Therefore, Kelly has 175 games in her collection.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many years old is Kelly now. According to the question, Kelly was born in 1984 and she is currently 37 years old. Therefore, her age at present is 37. Next, we need to calculate how many years have passed since Kelly was born until now. From 1984 to 2022, there are 38 years. Finally, we can determine how many times Kelly has been alive for 38 years by dividing the number of years that have passed since her birth by her current age. So, Kelly has been alive for 38 years / 37 = 105 months.
Response:  We know that Randy has 52 balls and he wants to put them in 38 boxes. So we need to find out how many balls each box can hold.  To do this, we divide the total number of balls (52) by the number of boxes (38):  Number of balls per box = Total number of balls / Number of boxes = 52 / 38 = 1.369545454545455.  Therefore, each box can hold approximately 1.4 balls.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of balls.  Since there are 72 friends in total, we can calculate the number of balls each friend will get as follows: Number of balls per friend = Total number of balls / Number of friends = 97 / 72 = 13.5 balls per friend So, Randy will have 72 - 13.5 = 58.5 balls left after dividing them among his friends.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 balls and he wants to divide them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of balls.  Therefore, we need to find out how many groups of friends Randy can make with this number of balls.  To do this, we use division.  So, we divide 79 by 14 (the number of friends Randy wants to give balls to), which gives us 5.6 (round down to the nearest whole number).  This means that Randy can make 6 groups of friends, each group getting 10 balls (since 79 divided by 14 is 5.6, and 5.6 rounded down is 6).
Response:  According to the question, Randy has 58 balls and he throws 27 of them into the basket. So, the number of balls that are not thrown into the basket is 53 (58 - 27). Now, let's consider the probability of each ball entering the basket. There are 10 baskets in total, so the probability of each ball entering any particular basket is 1/10. Therefore, the probability of all 53 balls not thrown into the basket entering the basket is (53 x 1/10) = 5.3.  So, the final answer is 5.3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has 36 balls in total.  Secondly, he throws 33 balls into the basket and misses 3 shots. Thirdly, he makes 18 baskets out of 30 attempts, which means he scores 18 points. Finally, he shoots free throws and makes 15 out of 20 attempts, scoring an additional 15 points. Therefore, Randy scores a total of 33 + 18 = 51 points.
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 balls and he throws them equally into two baskets - one with 79 balls and another with 82 balls. So, we can calculate the ratio of balls in each basket as follows:  Basket A (79 balls): 86 / 2 = 43 balls per basket Basket B (82 balls): 86 / 2 = 41 balls per basket Now, let's find out how many times Randy threw the ball to fill up Basket B:  Number of times Randy threw the ball to fill up Basket B = Total number of balls thrown / Number of balls in Basket B = 86 / 82 = 10.7% Of course, this is not a whole percentage, but close enough for our calculation purposes. Therefore, the answer is:  Randy threw the ball approximately 10.7% more times to fill up Basket B than Basket A.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 letters in ""Randy ប្រើប្រាស់ផ្លូវ"".  If we count the number of vowels in this word, we get 4 vowels (a, e, i, and o). Therefore, the number of consonants in this word is 32 (36 - 4 = 32)."
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 balls and he wants to divide them equally among 20 friends. So each friend will get 43 balls (86/20). Now let's consider the second part of the question where Randy also wants to give 50 balls to his teacher as a gift. So in total, Randy will have given away 93 balls (86 + 50). Therefore, the number of balls left with Randy is 86 - 93 = -17 balls.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 friends and he invited them to play football for 89 minutes. So, the total number of people playing football is: 90 x 89 = 7910.  Now, we need to calculate the number of people who did not play football. There are 63 people who did not play football out of the remaining 210 people (63 + 147 = 210). Therefore, the final answer is: 7910 - 210 = 7700.
"Response:  We are given that there are 20 students in a class and they have to take a test called ""Saelian Test"" which consists of 5 questions. Each question has 4 options and each correct option carries 1 mark. So, if all 20 students answer all 5 questions correctly, how many marks will they get in total?  Solution:  To calculate the total number of marks, we need to multiply the number of questions (5) with the number of correct options per question (4). Therefore, the total number of marks for all 5 questions is: 5 x 4 = 20 marks. Now, since there are 20 students, the total number of marks obtained by all students is: 20 x 20 = 400 marks."

Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has been working at his company for 5 years (Year 1 to Year 5).  In total, he has worked for 5 x 5 = 25 years.  Now, let's calculate how much money he has earned during those 25 years:  Money Earned = Salary per year x Number of years worked = $80,000 x 25 = $2,000,000 So, Dave has earned a total of $2,000,000 in his entire career at the company.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

1. Dave has 12 apples.
2. He gives 4 apples to his friend.
3. Now he has 8 apples left.

So, the number of apples Dave had after giving some to his friend is 8."
Response:  According to the question, Dave has been working for 8 years and 6 months (18 years + 6 months = 24 years). During this time, he has saved $10,000 per year ($24 years x $10,000/year = $240,000). Therefore, the total amount of money that Dave has saved is: $$ Total savings = Number of years worked x Annual salary x Years worked \text {= } 24 \times 10,000 \times 8.6 = 2,040,000$$ So, the answer is $2,040,000.
Response:  According to the question, Dave has been working for 18 years and has taken 12 days off. So, he has worked for (18 - 12) = 6 years without taking any day off.

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Haley has been working as a nurse. According to the question, she has worked for 14 years as a nurse. So, the number of days she has worked is: 14 years x 365 days/year = 5,095 days.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients Haley has taken care of during her 14-year nursing career. Based on the question, each patient takes about 3 days to recover. Therefore, the total number of patients Haley has taken care of is: 5,095 days / 3 days per patient = 1,698 patients.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley has been working as a nurse for 3 years and 6 months (18 months). Secondly, she is currently working at a hospital in Phnom Penh (city) where she earns $400 per month. Thirdly, her salary will be increased to $500 per month after 2 years of work experience (in 2 years time). Fourthly, she wants to save money to buy a house (which costs around $10,000). Fifthly, she plans to save $500 per month from her new salary ($500 - $400 = $100). Sixthly, it takes approximately 20 months to save $10,000 if you save $100 per month (20 x $100 = $2,000). Therefore, Haley will take 20 months to save enough money to buy a house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley has been working at the company for 20 years and she is currently in her mid-40s (not specified).  Secondly, we are told that she has been doing well in her job and has received positive feedback from her superiors. Thirdly, we learn that she has been offered a promotion to a higher position with more responsibilities, but she is hesitant to accept it because of her age and fear of not being able to handle the new role. Finally, we are informed that if she does not take the promotion, she will be replaced by someone younger who can do the job better. Based on these pieces of information, I would estimate that Haley's chances of getting the promotion are around 30%.
Response:  If Haley has 12 balls and she throws them all at once, then each ball will cover an area of $ \frac{1}{12} \text {of the circle}$. Since there are $\pi$ radians in a full circle, we can calculate the area covered by each ball as follows: $$ Area = \pi \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{\pi}{12}$$ Therefore, if Haley throws all the balls at once, she will cover an area of $\frac{\pi}{12}$.
"Response:  According to the question, Haley has been working as a nurse for 8 years and has taken care of 10 patients per day on average. Therefore, the total number of patients she has taken care of is:

$$ \text {Total Number of Patients} = \text{Number of Years} \times \text{Average Number of Patients Per Year} $$
= $8 \times 10$
= $80$

So, Haley has taken care of $80$ patients in her 8-year career as a nurse."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last typhoon hit Cambodia. According to the given information, the last typhoon hit Cambodia 2 years ago. So, the number of days that have passed since then is: 2 years x 365 days/year = 730 days. Now, let's calculate the probability of another typhoon hitting Cambodia within the next 14 days. We know that there are approximately 8-9 tropical cyclones forming in the Western Pacific every year, and about half of them become typhoons. Of these, around 3-4 typhoons make landfall in Cambodia each year. Therefore, the probability of another typhoon hitting Cambodia within the next 14 days can be estimated as follows: Probability = Number of typhoons making landfall in Cambodia per year / Total number of tropical cyclones forming in the Western Pacific per year x 14 days  Probability = 3/8 x 14 = 0.375 or 37.5%. Hence, the answer is 37.5%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Haley has been in Cambodia so far. According to the question, she arrived in Phnom Penh on January 10 and spent 3 days there before traveling to Siem Reap. Therefore, from January 10 to January 12 (inclusive), Haley was in Phnom Penh for 3 days. From January 13 to present (the time of asking the question), Haley has been in Siem Reap for x days. So, the total number of days Haley has been in Cambodia is: 3 + x = 16  Therefore, the answer is x = 13.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last typhoon hit Cambodia. According to the given information, the last typhoon hit Cambodia 10 days ago. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since the last typhoon is 10. Next, we need to calculate the probability of another typhoon hitting Cambodia within the next 5 days. The probability of another typhoon hitting Cambodia within the next 5 days is 0.2 or 20%. So, the final answer is 0.2 x 10 = 2.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in a year. There are 365 days in a non-leap year and 366 days in a leap year. Now, let's calculate the number of days between the two dates given in the question. The first date is January 1st, 2022, and the second date is December 31st, 2024. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is 2 years + 1 day = 366 days. So, the answer is 366 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  The date of the event is December 20, and the date for which the ticket was bought is January 3.  Therefore, there are 18 days difference between these two dates.  Now, let's calculate the number of days left for the event after buying the ticket.  We know that the ticket was bought on January 3, so there are 15 days left for the event (December 20 - January 3 = 15 days).  Finally, we need to multiply the number of days left for the event by the price of the ticket to get the total amount spent.  If we multiply 15 days by $20, we get $300 ($20 x 15 days).  So, the answer is $300.
Response:  The question is asking about the number of days that have passed since the Cambodian New Year (Choul Chnam Thmey) fell on April 14th. To find this out, we need to count forward from today until April 14th. Today is April 20th, so the number of days between now and April 14th is:  20 - 14 = 6 days. Therefore, the answer is 6 days.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 days in a week. So, if someone works for 10 hours per day, they will work for a total of 70 hours in a week (10 hours/day x 7 days/week).  Now, let's calculate how many working days someone has worked in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so if someone works for 70 hours/week, they have worked for a total of 3640 hours in a year (70 hours/week x 52 weeks/year).  Finally, to find out how much money someone has earned in a year, we need to multiply the number of working days by their hourly wage. Based on the information provided earlier, someone earns $18/hour. Therefore, the person has earned a total of $67,600 in a year ($3640 hours/year x $18/hour).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 days in a week. So, if someone works for 40 hours per week, they will work for 280 hours (40 x 7) in a month. Now, let's calculate how many working days they have in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of working days in a year is 280 x 12 = 3360 hours. Therefore, the person has worked for 3360 hours in a year.
Response:  The first sentence says that there are 40 days in a month, and the second sentence mentions that the festival falls on the 15th day of the lunar calendar. So, we can calculate the date of the festival as follows:  Date of festival = 15th day of the lunar calendar + 40 days = March 26, 2023 (based on the Gregorian calendar) Therefore, the correct answer is (B) March 26, 2023.
"Response:  If we have to calculate the number of days between two dates, we need to subtract their difference in days.  In this case, the first date is March 20, and the second date is April 15, so the difference in days is:

March 20 - April 15 = 15 days

Therefore, there are 15 days between these two dates."
Response:  The question asks about the number of days between two dates: 28th March and 14th April. To find this number, we need to subtract the date of 28th March from the date of 14th April: 14th April - 28th March = 16 days. Therefore, there are 16 days between these two dates.
Response:  The question asks about the number of days between two dates: 82 days and 61 days. So, we need to find the difference between these two numbers.  To do this, we can subtract the smaller number (61) from the larger number (82): 82 - 61 = 21 days. Therefore, there are 21 days between the two dates.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between the two dates given in the question. The first date is ""ទៅ មើល"" which means ""the day before yesterday"" and the second date is ""ស្រូវ"" which means ""yesterday"". So, the difference between these two dates is 1 day.  Next, we need to calculate the number of days between the current date (which is assumed to be today) and the date ""ស្រូវ"" which is yesterday. This gives us another 1 day. Therefore, the total number of days between today and yesterday is 2 days. Now, let's count forward from yesterday to find out how many days have passed since the incident occurred. Starting from yesterday, each day is counted as 1 day, so there are 3 days that have passed since the incident occurred. Finally, we add the number of days that have passed since the incident occurred to the number of days between today and yesterday to get the total number of days that have passed since the incident happened. In this case, the total number of days that have passed since the incident occurred is 5 days (3 + 2)."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: ពួកគេបានប្រមូល (January 10, 2023) Date of the second event: ដែលត្រូវបានប្រមូល (February 15, 2023) Subtracting the two dates gives us: 24 days So, there are 24 days between the two events.
Response:  We know that there are 5 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 5 days with 24 hours per day, we get 120 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours the person has worked in total. According to the question, the person has worked for 3 months which is equal to 90 days. If we multiply 90 days with 24 hours per day, we get 2160 hours worked in 3 months. Therefore, the answer is 2160 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days have passed since the person started working at the company. According to the question, they started working there 10 years ago, so if today is 2023, then they started working in 2013. Therefore, the number of days they have worked at the company is: 2013 - 2023 = -10 years. Next, we need to calculate how much money they have earned during those 10 years. Based on the information provided, their monthly salary is $5,000, and they work for 20 days in each month. So, their total monthly income is: $5,000 x 20 days/month = $100,000 per month. Now, let's calculate their total earnings over the past 10 years: $100,000 x 10 years = $1,000,000. Finally, we need to convert that amount from US dollars to Cambodian riel. As of March 2023, the exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = 4,000 CAD. Therefore, their total earnings over the past 10 years in Cambodian riel are: $1,000,000 / 4,000 CAD/USD = 250,000,000 CAD (approximately).
"Response:  The question asks about the number of days it takes for a person to learn how to play chess.  If we assume that the person starts learning at age 5 and learns at a rate of 10 minutes per day, then:

Age 5-6 = 1 year (learning rate: 10 min/day)
Age 6-7 = 2 years (learning rate: 10 min/day)
Age 7-8 = 3 years (learning rate: 10 min/day)
Age 8-9 = 4 years (learning rate: 10 min/day)
Age 9-10 = 5 years (learning rate: 10 min/day)
Total time = 5 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 15 years
Therefore, it will take approximately 15 years for a person to learn how to play chess from scratch if they start learning at age 5 and learn at a rate of 10 minutes per day."

Response:  If we have to calculate how many days it takes for a person to save $1000, we need to know some basic information first.  How much money does the person make per month?  Let's assume they make $5000 per month.  Now, let's calculate how long it would take to save $1000 based on their income.  To do this, we divide their monthly income by the amount they want to save:  $5000 / $1000 = 5 months  So, it would take 5 months for the person to save $1000 if they make $5000 per month and spend nothing else.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: ពួកគេបានប្រមូល (January 10, 2023) Date of the second event: ដែលហត្ថភាពធ្វើការប្រមូល (February 15, 2023) Therefore, the difference between these two dates is: February 15, 2023 - January 10, 2023 = 15 days Now, let's check if the person has worked for 40 hours per week during those 15 days. If they have worked for 40 hours per week, then the total number of working hours during that period would be: 15 days x 40 hours/week = 600 hours If they have not worked for 40 hours per week, then the total number of working hours during that period would be: 15 days x (number of hours worked/week) = (number of hours worked/week) So, based on the information provided in the question, the answer is: 600 hours
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in a year. There are 365 days in a non-leap year and 366 days in a leap year.

Now, we need to find out how many times the Razorbacks won the game. We can do this by dividing the number of points they scored (106) by their opponent's score (136):

Razorbacks won the game: 106 / 136 = 0.78

So, the Razorbacks won the game 78% of the time."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many razors are there in each pack of razors sold by Walmart. According to the question, each pack contains 10 razors, so there are 10 razors per pack. Now, let's calculate how much money Walmart has spent on buying these razors from the manufacturer. The cost price of each razor is $98, so the total cost of 10 razors would be $98 x 10 = $980. Therefore, Walmart has spent $980 on buying these razors from the manufacturer. Next, we need to find out how many packs of razors Walmart has bought from the manufacturer. According to the question, Walmart has bought 123 packs of razors, so the total number of razors Walmart has bought is 123 x 10 = 1230 razors. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walmart has spent on buying these razors including the cost of transportation and other expenses. Based on the information provided in the question, Walmart has spent $980 on buying the razors themselves, and they have also spent an additional $45 per pack for transportation and other expenses, which means they have spent a total of $980 + ($45 x 123) = $980 + $56,750 = $57,730 on buying these razors. So, the answer to the question is $57,730.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the razorback hog farrowing project in Arkansas and Texas Tech. The cost per piglet is given as $ 51, and there are 130 piglets in total. Therefore, the total cost of the project can be calculated as follows: Total Cost = Number of Piglets x Cost per Piglet = 130 x $ 51 = $ 6,430 So, the first part of the question asks how much money was invested in the project. Based on the calculation above, the investment amounted to $ 6,430. Now let's move on to the second part of the question. We are asked how many acres of land were needed for the project. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the question. However, we know that the project involved raising razorback hogs in both Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, we can assume that the land required for each location would vary depending on factors such as climate, availability of feed, and other considerations related to animal husbandry. As such, it is difficult to provide an exact answer to this portion of the question without additional context or information.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both teams during their matches in the tournament.  The distance traveled by Arkansas is given as $ 201 \text{ miles} $.  Similarly, the distance traveled by Texas Tech is also given as $ 201 \text{ miles} $.  Therefore, the total distance traveled by both teams together is equal to $ 402 \text{ miles} $.  Next, we need to find out how many games each team played in the tournament.  According to the question, Arkansas played $ 3 \text{ games} $, and Texas Tech played $ 4 \text{ games} $.  Finally, we can calculate the average distance traveled per game for each team using the following formula:

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group of friends.  There are 10 groups of friends, and each group has an average of 4 members (including the person who is asking the question). Therefore, there are 40 people in total (10 groups x 4 members per group).  Next, we need to calculate the number of times each person appears in the list of names. Since there are 40 people in total, and each person appears once in the list of names, the answer is simply 40.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of people who have been in love at least once in their lifetime. According to the question, this group consists of those who have ever loved someone and then lost that person, as well as those who are still in love with their current partner. Therefore, the total number of people in this category can be calculated as follows:  Number of people who have ever loved someone = 10 + 20 = 30  (This is based on the assumption that there are 10 people who have never been in love and 20 people who have been in love at least once.) Number of people who are still in love with their current partner = 5 + 8 = 13 (This is based on the assumption that there are 5 people who are still in love with their first love and 8 people who are still in love with their second or third partner.) Total number of people who have been in love at least once = 30 + 13 = 43 Now, let's move on to the next part of the question, which asks about the percentage of people who have been in love at least once. To calculate this percentage, we need to divide the total number of people who have been in love at least once by the total population of Cambodia. Based on the latest estimates from the National Institute of Statistics, the population of Cambodia was approximately 16 million in 2020. Therefore, the percentage of people who have been in love at least once can be calculated as follows: Percentage of people who have been in love at least once = (Number of people who have been in love at least once / Total population of Cambodia) x 100 = (43 / 16,000,000) x 100 = 0.27% So, according to our calculation, around 0.27% of the population of Cambodia has been in love at least once.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of people who have been in charge of the country for at least one year. According to the question, there are 4 people who have held this position, so their total number is 4.  Next, we need to calculate the average length of time each person has been in charge. Based on the information provided, the average length of time is 10 years. Therefore, the total number of years these people have been in charge is 4 x 10 = 40 years. Finally, we multiply the total number of years by the number of people who have held the position to get the total number of years that all four people have been in charge, which is 40 x 4 = 160 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 days in a week.  Secondly, we know that each day has 24 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours in a week is: 14 x 24 = 312 hours. So, the answer is 312 hours.
Response:  We know that Lewis received $460 for working 5 hours per day for 5 days. So, we can calculate his total earnings as follows: Total Earnings = Number of Hours worked x Rate Per Hour Total Earnings = 5 hours/day x $460/day = $2300/week Now, let's convert this amount to Cambodian Riel (KHR). Exchange rate is assumed to be 1 USD = 4,000 KHR. Therefore, Total Earnings in KHR = $2300 x 4,000 KHR/USD = 8,600,000 KHR So, the answer is 8,600,000 KHR.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mr. Lewis has been working at the company for 12 years (answer A). Secondly, he was promoted to manager after 6 years of service (answer B). Thirdly, his salary increased by $5000 per year after promotion (answer C). Finally, he earned a total of $78,000 in 12 years (answer D). Therefore, the correct answer is option D: $78,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mr. Lewis has been given two options to choose from: Option A and Option B.  If he chooses Option A, he will receive $20,000 as his reward. On the other hand, if he chooses Option B, he will not receive any reward.  Now, let's calculate the expected value of each option based on the probability of winning:  For Option A: The probability of winning is 1/3 = 0.33 (since there are three possible outcomes). Therefore, the expected value of Option A can be calculated as follows: E(A) = 0.33 x $20,000 = $6,667  For Option B: The probability of winning is also 1/3 = 0.33. So, the expected value of Option B can be calculated in the same way: E(B) = 0.33 x $0 = $0  Since both options have the same probability of winning, we can conclude that the expected value of either option is equal. Therefore, the best choice for Mr. Lewis would be Option A, which offers him a guaranteed reward of $20,000 with a probability of 1/3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has 136 cards in his deck and he draws one card at a time. Therefore, after drawing 20 cards, he will have 136 - 20 = 116 cards left in his deck.  Next, we are asked how many cards Lewis can draw before he runs out of cards. Since he has 116 cards remaining in his deck, he can draw up to 116 / 4 = 29 cards before running out of cards. So, the answer is 29 cards.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has 28 balls in his bag and he wants to put them into 1091 boxes of different sizes.  We also know that each box can hold at most 37 balls (based on the information given).  Therefore, we need to find out how many boxes Lewis needs to use to store all his balls.  To do this, we divide the total number of balls (28) by the maximum capacity of each box (37):  

$$ \frac{28}{37} = 0.76 $$  So, Lewis needs approximately 76 boxes to store all his balls."

Now, let's calculate the number of working days during this period. We know that every year, there are 260 working days in a leap year and 253 working days in a non-leap year. Since the current year is a leap year, there will be 260 working days from 9th February to 10th March. Therefore, the answer is (260 x 23) = 5860 working days.
Response:  We know that there are 10 people in total, including the two leaders.  Each leader has to give a speech for 3 minutes each, so altogether they will speak for 6 minutes (2 x 3 = 6).  Now, let's calculate how much time is left for the other eight people to speak.  There are 8 non-leader participants, and each of them can speak for 2 minutes (8 x 2 = 16).  So, the total time for all 10 participants to speak is 6 + 16 = 22 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ron has 5 balls in his pocket.  We also know that he has thrown one ball away and now he has 4 balls left.  So, the number of balls Ron has left is 4.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  The date of the event is December 20, 2019, and the date when the work will be completed is February 15, 2020. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:

December 20, 2019 - February 15, 2020 = 43 days

Now, let's convert this number into weeks:

43 days / 7 days/week = 6 weeks

Therefore, the work will take approximately 6 weeks to complete."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ron has 16 balls in his bag.  We also know that each ball has a number from 0 to 8 printed on it.  Therefore, there are a total of 16 x 8 = 128 possible numbers for the balls in Ron's bag.  So, the probability that one of the balls is the lucky number 7 is 1/128 or approximately 0.0075.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 people in total, including the bride and groom.  Among them, 3 people have not received any gifts yet (the bride, the groom, and their friend). So, the number of people who have received at least one gift is 7 (including the other 6 guests). Therefore, the probability that any particular guest has received exactly 2 gifts is $\frac{7}{10}$.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in 34 years. There are 365 days in a year, so:

$$ \text{Number of days} = 34 \times 365 = 12,070 \days $$
Now, we need to find out how many times Brian has visited his parents during these $12,070$ days. According to the question, Brian visits his parents every $2$ years, so:

$$ \text{Number of visits} = 12,070 \div 2 = 6,035 \text{ visits} $$
Therefore, the answer is $6,035$."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brian has 4 dogs and each dog has 3 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is 4 x 3 = 12 puppies.  Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We are asked how many puppies Brian's father has. Since Brian's father is not mentioned to have any puppies, the answer is zero (0) puppies. So, the final answer is 12 puppies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brian has been studying English for 2 years and 3 months. Therefore, he can speak English fluently with an accent after 2 years and 3 months of study.  Secondly, we are told that Brian is now able to communicate in English without any difficulty or hesitation when speaking with native speakers. This means that his pronunciation and grammar have improved significantly over time. Thirdly, we are informed that Brian's vocabulary consists of around 100 words, which is a relatively small number compared to a native speaker's vocabulary. However, this does not necessarily mean that Brian cannot express himself effectively in English. Fourthly, we are told that Brian's listening comprehension skills have improved dramatically since he started studying English. This suggests that he is better able to understand spoken English than before. Finally, we are given information about the duration of Brian's English classes per week, which is 2 hours. Based on these details, we can conclude that Brian has made significant progress in learning English, particularly in terms of improving his pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and listening comprehension skills.
Response:  We know that Brian has been studying for 9 months and has learned 46 words so far. Since he studies for 10 hours per day, we can calculate how many words he learns per hour as follows: Number of words learned per hour = Total number of words learned / Time spent studying In this case, the total number of words learned is 46, and the time spent studying is 9 months x 10 hours/day = 90 days. Therefore, the number of words learned per hour is: Number of words learned per hour = 46 / 90 = 0.51 or approximately 0.5 words per hour.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Brian has been to Cambodia and Vietnam twice each for 3 months. So, in total, he has spent 6 months (2 x 3) in those countries.  Next, we are asked how many times he has visited these countries during his lifetime. We can assume that ""lifetime"" means from birth until death, so we need to calculate the number of years Brian has lived. Based on the information provided earlier, Brian was born in 1985 and will turn 40 in 2025. Therefore, he has lived for approximately 37 years (from 1985 to 2025). Now, let's calculate the number of visits Brian has made to Cambodia and Vietnam during his lifetime:  Visits to Cambodia = Years lived x Months spent in Cambodia / 12  Visits to Cambodia = 37 x 6 / 12 = 10  Visits to Vietnam = Years lived x Months spent in Vietnam / 12  Visits to Vietnam = 37 x 6 / 12 = 10  Therefore, Brian has visited Cambodia and Vietnam a total of 20 times (10 + 10)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brian has 30 days to learn how to play the guitar.  Secondly, he wants to practice for 4 hours every day. Therefore, the total number of hours Brian will spend practicing is:  30 days x 4 hours/day = 120 hours  So, Brian will spend 120 hours practicing playing the guitar during his 30-day challenge.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Brian has 5 friends and each friend has 4 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils owned by Brian and his friends is:

5 friends x 4 pencils/friend = 20 pencils

Now, let's consider the additional pencils given to Brian as a gift. The question states that he received 3 more pencils, so the updated total number of pencils owned by Brian is:

20 pencils + 3 pencils = 23 pencils

Therefore, the answer to the question is 23."
Response:  If there are 10 people in total and each person has 2 children, then we have 20 people in total (including the parents).  Now, if each of these 20 people has 2 grandchildren, then we have 40 additional people (grandchildren) in total. Therefore, the total number of people including both adults and children is 60 (10 + 20 + 40 = 60).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 days in a week. So, if Carol has worked for 2 years (24 months), she would have worked for 2 x 12 = 24 weeks.  Next, we need to calculate how many working hours Carol has put in during those 24 weeks. Since each week consists of 5 working days, Carol would have worked for 5 x 24 = 120 working hours per month. Therefore, over the course of 2 years, Carol would have worked for 120 x 24 = 2880 working hours. Now, let's convert these working hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can calculate the total number of minutes Carol has worked as follows: 2880 working hours x 60 minutes/hour = 172800 minutes. Finally, since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the total number of minutes worked by Carol into seconds as follows: 172800 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 10392000 seconds.
"Response:  If we have $100 to invest in stock A and B, and each share of stock A costs $50 and each share of stock B costs $30, then we can buy:

$100 / $50 = 2 shares of stock A
$100 / $30 = 3 shares of stock B

So, if we invest all $100 in these two stocks, we will own 2 + 3 = 5 shares in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carol has 14 cats and she wants to give them away for adoption.  Secondly, we are asked how many cat owners will be able to adopt all of these cats.  Therefore, the number of cat owners who can adopt all of Carol's cats is 14 / 5 = 2.8.  So, approximately 3 cat owners will be able to adopt all of Carol's cats.
Response:  We know that the number of girls is 3 and the number of boys is 2. So, in total there are 5 children (3 girls + 2 boys). Now, we need to find out how many pairs of siblings there are among these 5 children. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of pairs of siblings = Total number of children / 2. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pairs of siblings = 5 / 2 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 pairs of siblings among the 5 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Melissa has been working at the company for 12 years (answer A). Secondly, we are told that she has been promoted to manager level (answer B). Finally, we are asked how many times her salary has increased since she started working at the company. Based on this information, we can calculate that her salary has increased 36 times (answer C) since she started working at the company. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 36 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Melissa has been working for 3 years and has taken 81 days off.  Therefore, her total work experience is:  3 years x 52 weeks/year = 168 weeks  + 81 days = 249 weeks  So, Melissa has worked for approximately 249 weeks.
"Response:  According to the question, there are 108 people in the group and they have been traveling for 32 days. So, the total number of days each person has traveled is:

$$ \text {Total days} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{(\text{Number of people}) \times (\text{Speed}) } $$

We know that the total distance is 79 kilometers, so we can plug it into the formula:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total days} &= \frac{79}{108} \times (100) \\ &= 0.74 \end{aligned} $$

So, each person has traveled for approximately $0.74$ days."
Response:  We know that Melissa has been working for 21 years and has taken 7 days off during this time. So, we can calculate the total number of workdays as follows:  Workdays = Total years of work - Number of days off  Workdays = 21 - 7  Workdays = 14  Therefore, Melissa has worked for 14 years without taking any days off.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Melissa has been working for 8 years and 3 months in her current job.  Therefore, she has worked for a total of 8 + 3 = 11 years and 3 months.  Secondly, we are told that she has received 4 bonuses during this period, which means she has earned a total of 4 x $500 = $2,000 in bonuses.  Finally, we are asked how much money Melissa has saved overall during these 11 years and 3 months. Based on the information provided, we can calculate this as follows: Total amount earned = Salary + Bonuses = $60,000 + $2,000 = $62,000. So, the answer is $62,000.
Response:  We know that there are 4 wheels on each side of the Ferris wheel, and each wheel has 2 axles (a total of 8 axles). Therefore, the number of connections between the Ferris wheel and the ground is 8 x 4 = 32. So, the answer is 32.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 wheels in total for the Ferris wheel.  Secondly, each wheel has 4 seats, so the total number of seats is 18 x 4 = 72. Thirdly, we need to subtract the number of occupied seats from the total number of seats to find out how many unoccupied seats are available. In this case, if 6 people have already sat down, then 72 - 6 = 66 unoccupied seats are left. Therefore, the answer is 66.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of Ferris wheels in the park. There are 20 Ferris wheels in the park. Next, we need to find out how many tickets each Ferris wheel can sell per hour. According to the question, each Ferris wheel can sell 18 tickets per hour. Therefore, the total number of tickets that all 20 Ferris wheels can sell per hour is: 20 x 18 = 360 tickets per hour. Finally, we need to determine how much money each ticket costs. According to the question, each ticket costs $5. So, the total amount of money that all 20 Ferris wheels can earn per hour is: 360 x $5 = $1,800 per hour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 wheels in total for the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park.  Secondly, we understand that each wheel has 4 seats, so there are 18 x 4 = 72 seats in total. Thirdly, we learn that 16 of these seats are occupied, leaving 72 - 16 = 56 unoccupied seats. Finally, we see that 10 people can fit in one car, so the number of cars needed to accommodate all the unoccupied seats is 56 / 10 = 5. Therefore, the answer is 5 cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 wheels in total for the Ferris wheel (2 at the bottom and 2 at the top). Therefore, the number of possible positions for each wheel is 8 (since there are 2 wheels at the bottom and 2 wheels at the top). Now, let's count the number of ways to arrange these 8 positions so that no two adjacent seats have the same height difference:  There are 3 seats at the bottom and 13 seats at the top, so the total number of seating positions is 3 + 13 = 16. However, as mentioned earlier, some of these seats may have the same height difference, which means they cannot be arranged in different positions. So, the actual number of unique seating arrangements is 16 - 2 = 14.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are in each class. There are 14 classes in total, and each class has 30 students, so there are 420 students in total (14 x 30 = 420). Now, let's calculate how many students can fit on the Ferris wheel at most. According to the question, the Ferris wheel can hold 80 students at once, so we divide the total number of students by 80 to get the maximum number of times the Ferris wheel can take them for a ride: 420 / 80 = 5.  Therefore, the Ferris wheel can take the students for a ride 5 times at most.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of seats in both Ferris wheels. The first wheel has 16 gondolas, and each gondola can accommodate 4 people, so the total number of passengers is 16 x 4 = 64. Similarly, the second wheel has 12 gondolas, and each gondola can accommodate 4 people, so the total number of passengers is 12 x 4 = 48. Now, let's compare the two numbers: 64 > 48, so there are more passengers in the first Ferris wheel.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 students in total, and we want to find out how many of them can fit on the Ferris wheel at most.  The Ferris wheel has 4 seats per car, so we need to divide the number of students by 4 to get the maximum number of students who can ride the Ferris wheel at once.  Therefore, the answer is:

$$ \frac{12}{4} = 3 $$

So, three students can fit on the Ferris wheel at most."
Response:  If we have $4$ coins and want to make change for $2$ dollars, then we need $1$ more coin. So, there are $5$ coins in total.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in total between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death.  Date of birth = January 12, 1945 Date of death = February 7, 2018 Subtracting these two dates gives us a total of 73 years. So, the number of days that the person lived is: 73 years x 365 days per year = 26,355 days Now, let's convert this number into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so: 26,355 days x 24 hours per day = 627,670 hours Finally, let's convert this number into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 627,670 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 37,676,400 minutes And finally, let's convert this number into seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so: 37,676,400 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 2,267,776,800 seconds Therefore, the person lived for approximately 2,267,776,800 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are two options for the number of people who have been to Phnom Penh: 0 or 18. So, the probability of someone having been to Phnom Penh is 1/3 (or 0.33). Therefore, the expected value of the number of people who have been to Phnom Penh is: E(x) = 0.33 x 2 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 18 students in total and they are divided into 4 groups of 4 students each. So, the number of students in each group is 4. Now, we need to find out how many groups can be formed using all the 18 students. To do this, we divide 18 by 4, which gives us 4.5 groups. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 groups. Therefore, there are 5 groups of 4 students each.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 out of 10 items. There are $\frac{10!}{4!3!} = 25$ possible combinations.  Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 out of 8 remaining items after choosing 4 items. There are $\frac{8!}{2!6!} = 70$ possible combinations.  Finally, we need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of ways to arrange the pizza. Therefore, the answer is $25 \times 70 = 1750$.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""គ្នា"" (kun) appears in the text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the given passage.  After counting, we will get 5 occurrences of the word ""គ្នា"".  Next, we need to find out how many times the word ""ទីក្រឹ឴"" (tie kroh) appears in the text. Again, we can count the number of occurrences of that word in the given passage and get 3 occurrences.  Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The question asks us to find out how many times the phrase ""គ្នាទីក្រឹ឴"" (kun tie kroh) appears in the text. To do this, we simply need to multiply the number of occurrences of the first word (""គ្នា"") by the number of occurrences of the second word (""ទីក្រឹ឴""). So, if we have 5 occurrences of the word ""គ្នា"", and 3 occurrences of the word ""ទីក្រឹ឴"", then the total number of occurrences of the phrase ""គ្នាទីក្រឹ឴"" is 5 x 3 = 15.  Finally, the last part of the question asks us to find out how many times the phrase ""ថ្ងៃដាច់ណា"" (thlok da) appears in the text. This time, we don't need to count the occurrences of any specific words; instead, we can simply read through the passage and identify all instances where the phrase ""ថ្ងៃដាច់ណា"" appears. In this case, there are 4 instances of the phrase ""ថ្ងៃដាច់ណា"" in"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""Paige"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the name ""Paige"".  From the given text, we have:

P - 2 occurrences A - 3 occurrences I - 1 occurrence G - 1 occurrence E - 1 occurrence Total number of letters in ""Paige"": 7

Now, let's count the total number of words that contain the letters of ""Paige"":

Words containing P: 2 (Paige and Paiges) Words containing A: 4 (Page, pages, Paige, and Paiges) Words containing I: 1 (In) Words containing G: 1 (Girl) Words containing E: 1 (Eyes) Total number of words containing letters of ""Paige"": 8

Therefore, the answer is 8."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paige has 36 cards in her deck and she draws one card at a time without replacement. Therefore, the probability of drawing any particular card is 1/36.  Now, let's consider the situation where Paige has drawn a card with a value of $50. In this case, there are 4 cards remaining in the deck with a value of $50 or more, so the probability of drawing any of these cards is also 1/36.  Finally, let's assume that Paige has drawn all four cards with values greater than $50. In this scenario, there are no cards left in the deck with a value of $50 or more, so the probability of drawing any of these cards is zero (0).  Based on these calculations, the answer to the question is:  The probability of Paige drawing a card with a value greater than $50 after drawing a card with a value of $50 is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paige has 16 dogs and she wants to train them all to sit. So, the total number of dogs she needs to train is 16.  Next, we are asked how many times Paige will repeat each training session. The answer is given as 30 times. Therefore, the total number of repetitions for each dog is 30 x 16 = 480.  Finally, we are asked how many treats Paige will give out during the training sessions. The answer is given as 60 treats per dog. So, the total number of treats Paige will give out is 60 x 16 = 960 treats.
Response:  We are given that Paige has 10 friends and each friend has an average of 60 candy bars. So, in total, Paige has 10 x 60 = 600 candy bars.  Therefore, the answer is 600.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""Paige"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the name ""Paige"".  From the given text, we have:

I - 1
G - 1
E - 2
Total = 7

So, the word ""Paige"" appears 7 times in the given text."
"Response:  According to Matthew 18:2-4, if someone has something against you, go and tell them their fault between yourself alone and God. If they listen and repent, then you have gained your brother or sister back. But if they do not listen, then take one or two others along with you to confront them about their wrongdoing. If they still refuse to listen, then tell it to the church; and if they will not listen even to the church, treat them as an outsider until they are willing to listen and be reconciled. So in this case, we can say that Matthew had gained his brother or sister back when he went and told them their fault between himself alone and God. Therefore, the answer is 1."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesus was born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1). Then, we are told that King Herod ordered all the male children in and around Bethlehem to be killed (Matthew 2:16). However, we also know that Jesus was not among those who were killed (Matthew 2:23). Therefore, if there were 100 male children in Bethlehem at the time of Jesus' birth, then the number of boys who survived would be 99 (since one boy, Jesus, did not die). So, the answer is 99.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and He has come to this world to save us from our sins.  Secondly, we see in Matthew 16:13-20 that Jesus asked His disciples who people said that He was.  Peter answered correctly saying ""You are the Christ (or Messiah) of God.""  Thirdly, we read in Matthew 17:1-8 that Jesus took Peter, James, and John up onto a mountain where they saw Jesus transfigured before them.  Lastly, we learn from Matthew 28:16-20 that Jesus gave the Great Commission to His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything He had commanded them, and surely He will be with them always even until the end of age.  Based on these passages, I believe that Jesus Christ is indeed the Son of God and He has fulfilled His mission to save humanity from their sins."
Response:  If we have $300 and want to buy something that costs $17, then we will be left with $283 ($300 - $17). So, the answer is $283.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew wrote the Gospel according to Luke (Luke 1:1-4). Therefore, if Matthew wrote his Gospel before Luke did, then Matthew must have written it after 62 AD, which is when Luke finished writing his Gospel (Acts 1:1). So, Matthew must have written his Gospel between 62 and 70 AD.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the reign of King Herod (Matthew 2:1). Then, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to take Mary as his wife, for she would give birth to a son who would be called the Son of God (Matthew 1:20-25). After this, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem looking for the child who had been born king of the Jews (Matthew 2:1-3), but they were warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, so they went to their own country by another route (Matthew 2:12). Finally, after the death of Herod, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream again and told him to take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, where they stayed until the death of Herod (Matthew 2:13-18). So, based on these events described in Matthew chapter 2, we can conclude that Jesus was born between 6 BCE and 4 BCE, which is approximately 29 or 30 years before the death of Herod in 4 BCE.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew 14:22-33 is about Jesus feeding the crowd of five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes.  Secondly, we are asked how many baskets full of leftovers were collected after Jesus fed the crowd. From the passage, we see that twelve baskets full of leftovers were collected (Matthew 14:20). Therefore, the answer to the question is 12.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many days are there between Matthew 18 and now (based on the current date). We can use the following formula to calculate this:  Number of days = Today's date - Date of event (Matthew 18) Now, let's plug in the values:  Today's date = March 27, 2023 (based on my location) Date of event (Matthew 18) = Approximately 2,000 years ago (based on the Bible) So, the number of days between Matthew 18 and today is: Number of days = March 27, 2023 - Approximately 2,000 years ago = 1993 years Therefore, as of today (March 27, 2023), it has been approximately 1993 years since Matthew 18 occurred.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people have been healed through Jesus' ministry. According to Mark 1:40-45 and Luke 9:1-6, Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons. In addition, according to John 4:46-54, Jesus healed an official's son who was at the point of death. Therefore, there are three instances where Jesus healed someone through his ministry. So, the answer is 3.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""គ្រឿង"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After counting, we will get 13 instances of the word ""គ្រឿង"".  Now, let's count the number of times each letter of the word ""គ្រឿង"" appears in the text. For example, the letter ""ឃ"" appears 4 times, and the letter ""ឌ"" appears 2 times. By doing this, we will get a total of 56 letters appearing in the word ""គ្រឿង"". Therefore, the answer is 13 x 56 = 708."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew has 32 disciples (Matthew 10:1).  Secondly, we are told that Jesus sent out his twelve apostles to preach and to heal sicknesses (Matthew 10:7-8). Thirdly, we see that Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness (Matthew 10:1). Fourthly, we learn that they went out and preached that people should repent (Matthew 10:7). Fifthly, we read that they drove out many demons (Matthew 10:8). Sixthly, we find that King Herod tried to kill Jesus but failed (Matthew 14:1-12). Seventhly, we discover that Jesus feeds five thousand men with just five loaves of bread and two fish (Matthew 14:13-21). Eighthly, we notice that Jesus walks on water and saves Peter from drowning (Matthew 14:22-33). Ninthly, we observe that Jesus teaches about the importance of faith (Matthew 15:1-20). Tenthly, we learn that Jesus heals a Canaanite woman's daughter (Matthew 15:21-28). Eleventhly, we find that Jesus cleanses lepers (Matthew 15:29-31). Twelfthly, we read that Jesus raises Jairus' daughter from the dead (Matthew 15:21-28). Thirteenthly, we see that Jesus teaches about the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 16:1-20). Fourteenthly, we learn that Jesus predicts his death and resurrection (Matthew 16:21-28). Lastly, we find that Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for Passover (Matthew 20:17-19). Based on these points, it can be concluded that Matthew recorded 32 events in which Jesus performed miracles or taught important lessons during his ministry. Therefore, the answer is 32
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many months are there between Matthew's birth and his death. According to the Bible, Matthew was born in Bethlehem during the reign of King Herod (Matthew 2:1). Later, he became one of Jesus' twelve apostles (Matthew 4:18-22) and wrote his Gospel account around AD 50-60 (Matthew 1:1). Therefore, Matthew lived for approximately 80-90 years. So, from his birth to his death, there are 80-90 years x 12 months/year = 960-1080 months. Now, let's calculate how much land did Matthew own at the time of his death. In Luke 15:22, it is written that ""the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country, where he squandered his wealth."" This means that Matthew must have owned some land or property before he left for the distant country. However, since he spent all his money there and returned home penniless (Luke 15:13), he could not have owned more than 32 kings' talents (approximately $32 million USD today) as mentioned in verse 13. Therefore, the total amount of land Matthew owned at the time of his death can be estimated as follows: Total land ownership = Number of months alive x Monthly income per month  Since Matthew lived for approximately 80-90 years, his monthly income would have been relatively low compared to modern standards. Assuming an average monthly income of $100-$200 per month ($1000-$2000 adjusted for inflation), we get: Total land ownership = 960-1080 months x $100-$200/month = $96,000 - $108,000  Finally, we subtract the amount of land Matthew gave away to the poor (verse 21): Total land ownership = $96,000 - $30,000 = $66,000 - $78,000."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days that Matthew spent in prison. According to the Bible, Matthew was imprisoned for 4 years (Matthew 27:30). Therefore, the total number of days he spent in prison is:  4 years x 365 days/year = 1,460 days  Next, we need to calculate the number of days that Jesus spent with Matthew after his release from prison. According to Mark 2:14, Jesus went to Matthew's house and stayed there with him for 2 days. So, the number of days Jesus spent with Matthew after his release from prison is:  2 days = 48 hours = 2,880 minutes = 168,000 seconds Now, let's convert these numbers into their corresponding time units. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, and 60 minutes in 1 hour. Therefore, we can convert the number of seconds Jesus spent with Matthew as follows:  168,000 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2,733 minutes  Finally, we need to convert the number of minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so we can convert the number of minutes as follows:  2,733 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 45.5 hours  Therefore, the total number of hours Jesus spent with Matthew after his release from prison is:  45.5 hours
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of boys in each group.  There are 28 boys in Group A and 16 boys in Group B.  Therefore, the total number of boys is:  Boys = 28 + 16 = 44.  Next, we need to calculate the number of girls in each group.  There are 30 girls in Group A and 17 girls in Group B.  Therefore, the total number of girls is: Girls = 30 + 17 = 47.  Now, let's find out how many pairs of siblings there are between the two groups.  Each pair of siblings consists of one boy and one girl.  Therefore, the number of pairs of siblings is: Pairs of Siblings = (Boys x Girls) / 2 = (44 x 47) / 2 = 95.  Finally, let's add up all the numbers to get the total number of students in both groups: Total Students = Boys + Girls + Pairs of Siblings = 44 + 47 + 95 = 186.
Response:  We know that Debbie has been working at the company for 10 years and she is currently 35 years old. So, if we calculate from her current age to her retirement age of 60, it will be 25 years. Now, let's assume that she works 5 days a week, which means she has worked a total of 260 weeks in 10 years (assuming no vacation or sick leaves). Therefore, the number of workweeks Debbie has left before reaching her retirement age is:  Number of workweeks = Total workweeks x Remaining workyears / Retirement age - Current age  Number of workweeks = 260 x 25 / 60 - 35 = 1700 workweeks  So, Debbie has approximately 1700 workweeks left before reaching her retirement age of 60.
Response:  We know that Debbie has been working for 153 days and she is paid every Friday. So, if today is Thursday, then Debbie will be paid next week. Therefore, the number of Fridays Debbie has worked so far is: 153 / 4 = 38  Fridays.
"Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and we have to count from January 1st to December 31st. So, the total number of days is:

365 x 24 = 8760 hours

Now, let's calculate how many hours Debbie has worked:

Debbie works for 8 hours a day, so she has worked:

8760 hours / 8 hours per day = 1090 days

Therefore, Debbie has worked for 1090 days."
Response:  We know that there are 30 days in April and May combined (April has 30 days and May has 31 days). So, if we subtract the number of days from April (30) to May (31), we get 31 - 30 = 1 day. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 day.
Response:  We know that there are 38 days in April and May combined (April has 30 days and May has 8 days). So, if we subtract 14 days from 38 days, we get 24 days left. Now, let's count how many days are left after Debbie finishes her work:  Debbie works for 3 months, which is equal to 90 days (3 x 30 = 90). Therefore, after Debbie finishes her work, she will have 66 days left (24 - 90 = -66).
Response:  We know that Debbie has 200 cats and dogs, and she wants to give them away for free.  She also knows that each cat or dog takes up 1/4 of a room in her house.  So, if we calculate how many rooms are needed for all the pets, we get: Number of rooms = Total number of pets x Room per pet / 4 = 200 x 1/4 = 50 rooms. Therefore, Debbie needs 50 rooms to accommodate all her pets.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and we have to find out how many times the word ""Debbie"" appears in the given text.  So, let's count the number of appearances of ""Debbie"" in the text:

The word ""Debbie"" appears 6 times in the given text. Therefore, the answer is (6/7) = 0.86."
Response:  We know that there are 86 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we calculate the number of hours in a year, it will be: 86 days x 24 hours/day = 2072 hours/year Now, let's find out how many hours Debbie worked during her lifetime: Debbie worked for 35 years, so the total number of hours she worked is: 35 years x 2072 hours/year = 71,960 hours Therefore, the answer to the question is: Debbie worked for 71,960 hours during her lifetime.
Response:  We know that there are 360 degrees in a full circle and 162 degrees between two points on the same meridian. So, to find out how many degrees are between two points on different meridians, we need to subtract their distance in degrees from 360. For example, if the two points are separated by 45 degrees ( half of 90), then the angle between them is 45 degrees. Similarly, if they are separated by 75 degrees (half of 162), then the angle between them is also 75 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 75 degrees.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 14 children and she wants to give each of them equal inheritance. So, we need to divide the total amount of money among her 14 children equally.  The total amount of money is $10 million. Therefore, the share of each child will be:

$10 million / 14 children = $714,285 per child

So, Faye's youngest son will inherit $714,285 from his mother."
Response:  We know that Faye has 12 balls and she wants to divide them equally among her 3 friends. So, each friend will get 4 balls (12 / 3 = 4). Now, let's consider how many balls each of Faye's friends will have after receiving their share from her. For example, if one of Faye's friends gets 4 balls from her, then that friend will have 4 + 4 = 8 balls in total. Therefore, the final number of balls each of Faye's friends will have is:  Number of balls each friend will have = Total number of balls - Number of balls received from Faye  In this case, the total number of balls is 12, and each friend receives 4 balls from Faye, so the final number of balls each friend will have is:  Number of balls each friend will have = 12 - 4 = 8  Therefore, there are 8 balls for each of Faye's 3 friends.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Faye has 16 cards in her hand and she wants to get rid of all of them.  Secondly, each card has a value from 0 to 9, so there are a total of 36 possible values for each card (since 0 + 1 +... + 9 = 36). Thirdly, since Faye has 16 cards, the total number of possible combinations is 36^16 = 274,850,625,600. Fourthly, we know that Faye has already gotten rid of 16 cards, which means that there are only 274,850,625,600 - 16 = 274,850,625,584 remaining possibilities. Fifthly, we need to find out how many of these remaining possibilities correspond to the situation where Faye gets rid of all her cards. This can be done by counting the number of times the word ""all"" appears in the given text. Finally, we divide the result by 274,850,625,584 to obtain our answer. So, the answer is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Faye has 20 cats and she wants to give them away.  Secondly, each cat needs at least 4 kg of food per month, so in total, Faye needs to buy 80 kg of food for all her cats every month (20 cats x 4 kg/cat = 80 kg). Now, let's calculate how much money Faye spends on buying food for her cats every month. If the cost of one kilogram of cat food is $10, then Faye spends $800 on buying food for her cats every month ($80 kg / $10/kg = $800). Therefore, the answer is $800.
Response:  We know that Faye has 10 balls and she wants to give them equally among her 7 friends. So, we need to divide 10 by 7, which gives us 1.42857 (approximately). Therefore, each friend will get approximately 1.42857 balls from Faye.
Response:  We know that Faye has 4 cats and 27 dogs.  So, in total, she has 31 pets (4 cats + 27 dogs).
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 balls and needs to divide them equally among 30 people. So, each person will get 1 ball per 4 people (since there are 30 / 7 = 4.29 people per ball). Now, let's calculate how many balls each of the 30 people will get: Number of balls each person gets = Total number of balls / Number of people = 7 / 30 = 0.23 balls per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 0.23 balls.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 11 pairs of shoes and 27 bags.  Each pair of shoes contains two shoes, so we have 11 x 2 = 22 shoes in total. Similarly, each bag can contain multiple items, but let's assume an average of 5 items per bag (this is just for calculation purposes; you may want to adjust this number based on your actual experience). Therefore, we have 27 x 5 = 135 items in total. So, the answer is 22 + 135 = 157 items."
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 balls and she wants to divide them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 6 balls (30/5 = 6). Now, let's consider the situation where one of the friends already has 5 balls. In this case, we need to subtract the number of balls the friend already has from the total number of balls available, which is 30 - 5 = 25. Therefore, Faye can give 25 balls to the remaining 4 friends.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 7 days with 24 hours per day, we get 168 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Fay has spent studying since she started school until now. According to the question, Fay has studied for 6 years, which is equal to 6 x 365 = 2190 days. If we divide the total number of hours Fay has studied (168 hours/day x 2190 days) by the number of days she has been studying, we get approximately 37,680 hours. Therefore, the answer is 37,680 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Faye has 36 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among her 4 children.  So, each child will get 9 bags of rice (36/4 = 9).  However, since there are 2 more children than bags of rice, each additional child will receive only half of a bag of rice (9/2 = 4.5). Therefore, the total number of bags of rice that Faye can give to her children is 9 + 4.5 = 13.5 bags.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Faye has 30 pairs of shoes and each pair contains 5 shoes. Therefore, in total, Faye has 30 x 5 = 150 shoes.  Next, we are asked how many shoes does Faye have in her wardrobe. Based on the information provided earlier, Faye's wardrobe can hold up to 180 shoes. So, the number of shoes that Faye has in her wardrobe is 180 - 150 = 30 shoes.  Finally, we are asked if Faye has any extra shoes left over after filling her wardrobe. Since Faye has 30 shoes left over after filling her wardrobe, the answer is yes.
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 years of experience and 71 kids. So, she has an average of 2.4 kids per year (30/71). Now, we need to calculate how many kids she had in total during her 30-year career. Therefore, we multiply the number of kids she had per year by the number of years she worked: 2.4 x 30 = 64 kids.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Faye has 12 balls in total (balls 1-12). Then, she gives 3 of them to her friend (balls 1-3). So, the number of balls left with Faye is 9 (balls 4-12). Next, her friend returns 2 of the balls (balls 5 and 7) to Faye. Therefore, the number of balls left with Faye now is 7 (balls 4-10). Finally, Faye loses 2 more balls (balls 8 and 10), so the number of balls left with her is 5 (balls 4-9).  Hence, the answer is 5.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. According to the question, there are 21 classrooms with an average of 40 students per classroom, so the total number of students is:

$$ \text {Total number of students} = \frac{21}{40} \times 88 = 356 $$

Now, let's find out how many students passed the examination. The question states that 88 students passed the examination, which means:

$$ \text {Number of passing students} = \frac{88}{356} \times 100 = 24.79\% $$

Therefore, the percentage of students who passed the examination is approximately $24.79\%$."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group of 10. There are 84 people in total, and they are divided into groups of 10 according to their ages as follows: Group 1 (ages 25-34): 9 people Group 2 (ages 35-44): 16 people Group 3 (ages 45-54): 17 people Group 4 (ages 55-64): 14 people Group 5 (ages 65-74): 12 people Group 6 (ages 75+): 8 people Therefore, there are 9 + 16 + 17 + 14 + 12 + 8 = 85 people in all the groups combined.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of possible answers for each part of the question.  For Part A, there are 31 letters in the Khmer alphabet, so there are 31 possible answers.  For Part B, there are 20 letters in the Khmer alphabet, so there are 20 possible answers.  For Part C, there are 5 vowels and 7 consonants in the Khmer alphabet, so there are 12 possible answers (5 vowels x 2 consonants = 10 + 7 consonants).  Therefore, the total number of possible answers is 31 x 20 x 12 = 6480.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. According to the question, there are 87 benches in the school, and each bench has 5 students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:

87 benches x 5 students/bench = 435 students

Now, let's find out how many students passed the examination. The question states that 60% of the students passed the examination. To find out the number of passing students, we can multiply the total number of students by the percentage of passing students:

Total number of students x Percentage of passing students = Number of passing students

435 students x 60% = 269 students

Therefore, 269 students passed the examination."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are in each class. There are 24 classes in total, and each class has an average of 18 students (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the number of students in each class is:

Number of students per class = Total number of classes / Number of classes with 18 students
= 24 / 3
= 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in all 24 classes:
Total number of students = Number of students per class x Number of classes
= 8 x 24
= 192

So, there are 192 students in total."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. According to the question, there are 66 classrooms with an average of 30 students per classroom, so the total number of students is:

66 classrooms x 30 students/classroom = 1980 students

Now, let's find out how many students are in each grade level. The question states that there are 22 grades levels, and each grade level has an average of 45 students per grade level. Therefore, the total number of students in each grade level is:

22 grade levels x 45 students/grade level = 990 students

Finally, we need to subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students to get the number of students who did not pass. According to the question, 70% of the students passed, so the number of students who did not pass is:

990 students - (70% x 990 students) = 221 students

Therefore, the answer to the question is 221 students."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. According to the question, there are 30 classes and each class has 40 students, so the total number of students is:

30 classes x 40 students/class = 1200 students

Next, we need to find out how many students passed the examination. The question states that 80% of the students passed the examination, so the number of passing students is:

1200 students x 0.80 (passing rate) = 960 students

Finally, we need to find out how many students did not pass the examination. Subtracting the number of passing students from the total number of students gives us the number of failing students:

1200 students - 960 students = 240 students

Therefore, the answer to the question is 240 students did not pass the examination."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many possible ways there are for the teacher to give the test to the students. There are 72 students in total, and each student can take the test once. Therefore, the number of possible ways is 72 x 1 = 72. Now, let's count the number of times the teacher needs to go around the classroom to distribute the tests. The teacher needs to go around the classroom 3 times to hand out the tests to all the students. So, the number of times the teacher goes around the classroom is 3. Finally, we multiply the number of possible ways with the number of times the teacher goes around the classroom to get the total number of tests that the teacher needs to distribute: 72 x 3 = 216.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of years that the person has worked as an employee. According to the question, the person started working at the age of 20 and stopped working at the age of 65, which means they have worked for 45 years (65 - 20 = 45).  Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money that the person saved during their working life. Based on the question, the person saved $18,000 per year, which is equal to $792,000 over 45 years ($792,000 / $18,000 = 45). Therefore, the total amount of money that the person saved during their working life is $45 + $792,000 = $837,000.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that there are 10 people in total, including Haley and her family. We also know that Haley has 3 children, so she has 4 people under her care (including herself). Therefore, the number of people who do not have children is 6 (10 - 4 = 6).
Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and gives 5 to her friend, then she has 5 balls left.  Now, if her friend also has 5 balls, then they have a total of 10 balls (Haley's original 5 + her friend's 5). Therefore, the final number of balls that Haley has is 10 - 5 = 5.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that Haley has 23 siblings and each of them has 15 friends. Therefore, the total number of people who are related to Haley is: 23 x 15 = 345. So, the answer is 345.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 30 students in total, including Haley who has 26 friends. So, the number of friends that each student has is:

Number of friends per student = Total number of students / Number of students including Haley
= 30 / 1 (since Haley has 26 friends)
= 30 / 26
= 1.153846 (approximately)
Therefore, on average, each student has approximately 1.15 friends."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley has 20 friends and she is in class 2A. So, there are 20 people in her friend circle. Now, let's consider how many of them can sit next to her at one time. Since they are all in the same class, it means they will be sitting in rows with equal number of students in each row. Therefore, the maximum number of students who can sit next to Haley at one time is 4 (since there are 5 rows in total). Hence, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley has 28 friends in total.  Among them, there are 4 boys and 7 girls. So, the number of male friends is 4, and the number of female friends is 7. Therefore, the ratio of male to female friends is 4:7 or 1:1.5 (since there are more females than males).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 38 years old (answer A). Secondly, he has been working for 14 years (answer B). Finally, his salary is $60,000 per year (answer C). So, if we calculate the total amount of money Frank has earned during his working life, it will be: Total amount = Annual salary x Number of years worked = $60,000 x 14 = $840,000 Therefore, the correct answer is option C: $840,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has been working at the company for 20 years and he is now 58 years old (according to the information provided). Therefore, if Frank started working at the age of 38, then his current age is 58 - 38 = 20 years.  Secondly, we are asked how many days Frank worked before retiring. According to the question, Frank retired after working for 20 years, which means he worked for 20 years / 365 days per year = 5790 days.  Finally, we are asked how many weeks Frank worked before retiring. To convert the number of days into weeks, we divide the total number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week), resulting in 5790 days / 7 = 819 weeks.  So, to summarize, Frank worked for 20 years before retiring and accumulated 819 weeks of service before leaving the company.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 4 dogs and each dog can bark 3 times per day. So, in total, Frank's dogs will bark 12 times per day (4 dogs x 3 barks/dog/day). Now, let's consider how many days Frank has been away from home. Based on the information provided, he has been away for 7 days. Therefore, the total number of barks his dogs have made while he was away is 7 x 12 = 84 barks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death.  Date of birth: January 8, 1930 - Date of death: February 9, 2017 = 87 years  Therefore, the number of days that Frank lived is 87 years.
Response:  We know that Frank has 193 teeth and he brushes them for 15 minutes every day at 8 am. So, we can calculate the number of times he brushes his teeth per week as follows:  Number of days in a week = 7 Days per week = 1 x 7 = 7 Therefore, Frank brushes his teeth 7 x 15 = 105 times per week. Now, let's convert this to months: Months per year = 12 Months per year = 1 x 12 = 12 Therefore, Frank brushes his teeth 105 x 12 = 1260 times per year. Finally, let's convert this to years: Years = 10 Years = 1 x 10 = 10 Therefore, Frank brushes his teeth 1260 x 10 = 12,600 times in 10 years.
Response:  We know that Frank has 318 followers and he posts every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So, in one week (Monday to Sunday), Frank will post 5 times. Therefore, the number of likes he gets per day is:  Number of likes = Total number of posts / Number of days = 5 x 318 = 1,590 likes per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 12 dogs and each dog has 3 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is 12 x 3 = 36 puppies.  Next, we are asked how many puppies Frank has now. Since he already had 36 puppies and then he got 4 more puppies, the new total number of puppies is 36 + 4 = 40 puppies. So, the answer to the question is 40.
Response:  If we have 10 days in a week and each day has 24 hours, then there are 10 x 24 = 240 hours in a week. Now, if we subtract the number of hours spent sleeping (which is not specified), we get the total number of hours available for work or other activities. So, the answer is 240 - X, where X is the number of hours spent sleeping.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 38 years old. Secondly, he is currently working as an accountant for 10 years. Thirdly, he wants to retire at the age of 60. Fourthly, his monthly salary is $4,500. Fifthly, he wants to save $20,000 per year for retirement. Sixthly, he starts saving money from this year until he reaches the age of 60. Seventhly, he calculates how much money he can save each month based on his income and expenses. Eighthly, he finds out that he can save around $1,700 per month ($20,000 / 10 years). Ninthly, he realizes that if he saves consistently every month until he reaches the age of 60, he will have enough money to support himself during his retirement. Tenthly, he feels relieved knowing that he has made a good plan for his future.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 40 days to learn how to play chess.  Secondly, he spends 3 hours per day learning how to play chess. Therefore, in total, Frank will spend 120 hours (40 days x 3 hours/day) learning how to play chess. Finally, there are 24 hours in a day, so Frank will have spent half of his time learning how to play chess, which is 60 hours (120 hours / 24 hours).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 607 days to live. Now, let's calculate how many hours he will have in total during his lifetime. There are 24 hours in a day, so we can multiply 607 days by 24 hours/day to get the total number of hours Frank will have in his lifetime: 607 days x 24 hours/day = 14,698 hours In conclusion, Frank will have 14,698 hours in his lifetime.
Response:  Firstly, we know that លោក Frank has 4 dogs (ជំពូក). Secondly, each dog can bark at most 3 times per day (ទំព័រក្នុងមួយជំពូក). Therefore, in total, លោក Frank's dogs can bark at most 12 times per day (ទំព័រក្នុងមួយជំពូក x 4 = 12). Finally, if លោក Frank is away for 5 days (សៀវភៅនេះ), then his dogs will bark at most 60 times during those 5 days (12 x 5 = 60). So, the answer to the question is 60.
"Response:  We know that $x$ is the number of days since the last time the person watched a movie.  Since the person has been watching movies for 3 years, we can say that $x \in [0,3]$.  Now, let's find out how many movies the person has watched in total. According to the question, the person has watched 120 movies in total. So, we have:

Response:  We are given that there are 16 balls in total and we need to find out how many of them are red. So, let R be the number of red balls. Since there are 4 white balls and 8 blue balls, we can write: R + 4W + 8B = 16 (total number of balls) Now, we want to find out how many red balls are there. So, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: R + 4W + 8B = 16 → R = 4 (since there are 4 white balls) Therefore, there are 4 red balls in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 25 appears in the given sequence of numbers: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 25, \ldots$  Since we are asked for the number of occurrences of $25$, we can simply count the number of times $25$ appears in the sequence: $25, 25, 25, \ldots$ Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ occurrences of $25$ in the given sequence.
Response:  We know that there are 10 balls in total and we want to find out how many of them are red. So, the probability of picking a red ball is 1/2 since there is only one red ball among the 10 balls. Now, let's calculate the number of red balls we can get after picking 5 balls: Since there are 5 balls left after picking 5 balls, the probability of picking a red ball remains the same as before (i.e., 1/2). Therefore, the number of red balls we can get after picking 5 balls is also 5/2 = 2  So, the final answer is 2 red balls out of 10 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the digit 0 appears in the number ហាង លក់ អាហារ មួយ មាន ទឹក សូដា ធម្មតា ៦៧ កញ្ចប់ និង ទឹក សូដា ឌីអេត ៩ កញ្ចប់.  The digit 0 appears once in this number. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that there are 20 questions in total.  For each question, we have to choose one of the options A, B, C, or D. So, the probability of choosing the correct option is 1/5 = 0.2. Therefore, the expected value of the number of correct answers is: E(X) = 0.2 x 20 = 4. Now, let's calculate the standard deviation of the number of correct answers: Variance(X) = P(X > k) - (E(X))^2 = (1/5)^k - ((0.2 x 20)^2) = k! / 5^k where k is a positive integer. Since we want to find the expected value and standard deviation of the number of correct answers for 20 questions, we set k = 20. Substituting k = 20 into the formula above, we get: Variance(X) = 20! / 5^(20) = 3628800. Now, we can use the normal distribution table to find the z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.2. Based on the table, if we want to find the z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.2, we need to look at the row with a probability of 0.2 and find the corresponding z-score. The z-score corresponds to a probability of 0.2 is approximately 1.96. Therefore, the estimated standard deviation of the number of correct answers for 20 questions is approximately 1.96.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times 30 goes into 120. We know that 30 goes into 120 exactly 4 times (120 / 30 = 4). So, there are 4 groups of 30 in 120. Now, let's count how many times 8 goes into each group of 30. We know that 8 goes into 30 exactly 4 times (30 / 8 = 4). Therefore, there are 4 x 4 = 16 units of 8 in total. Finally, we add the number of units of 8 to the number of units of 30 to get the total number of units of both: 16 + 4 = 20. So, there are 20 units of 30 and 8 in total.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of apples that are not rotten. We know that there are 30 apples in total and 8 of them are rotten, so the remaining apples are 30 - 8 = 22. Now, let's count how many apples are sweet. There are 18 apples that are sweet, so the ratio of sweet apples to rotten apples is 18 : 8 or 2 : 1. Therefore, for every one rotten apple, there are two sweet apples. So, if we have x rotten apples, then we have 2x sweet apples. Finally, we can find out how many apples are not rotten by subtracting the number of rotten apples from the total number of apples. In this case, there are 22 non-rotten apples.

"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""ហាង"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of that word in the text.  After finding out the number of appearances of ""ហាង"", we need to divide it by 2 because there are two syllables in each of those words. So, if the number of appearances of ""ហាង"" is x, then the number of times the word ""ហាងលក់"" appears in the text is half of x, or x/2.  Next, we need to find out how many times the word ""លក់"" appears in the text. This time, we don't have to divide anything by 2 because there is only one syllable in each of those words. Therefore, if the number of appearances of ""លក់"" is y, then the total number of times both ""ហាងលក់"" and ""លក់"" appear together in the text is y + x/2 = (x+y)/2.  Finally, we add up all these numbers to get our final answer: 80 + (30+15)/2 = 145.  Therefore, there are 145 instances of the phrase ""ហាងលក់ទំនិញមួយមានទឹកកកធម្មតាចំនួន"" in the given text."

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 32 students in total who took the examination at Buckingham University.  Among them, 16 students passed the examination and became doctors.  Therefore, the number of students who did not pass the examination is equal to the number of students who passed it minus the number of successful candidates, which is 32 - 16 = 16.  So, the answer is 16.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. The date of the event is March 10th and the date when Rachel was born is February 27th. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is 13 days. Now, let's calculate the number of people who attended the event: According to the question, 469 people attended the event. Finally, we need to add the number of attendees to the total number of birthdays that occurred during the period of time between the two dates: Based on the calculation above, the total number of birthdays that occurred during this period is 829 + 469 = 1298. So, the answer to the question is 1298.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between the two dates given in the question:  The date when Rachel gave birth to her baby is April 10, and the date when she went to the Buckingham Palace is May 28. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:  Days = (May 28 - April 10) = 38 days.  Now, let's check if there are 38 babies born at Buckingham Palace during this period:  According to the information provided in the question, there were 38 babies born at Buckingham Palace during this time. So, the answer to the question is:  Yes, there were 38 babies born at Buckingham Palace during the period of 38 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between the two dates given in the question:  The date when Rachel gave birth to her baby is March 20th, and the date when she went to the Buckingham Palace is April 1st. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:  Days = (April 1st - March 20th) = 14 days  Next, we need to determine how many babies were born on that day:  According to the information provided in the question, there were 38 babies born at the same hospital as Rachel's baby on that day. So, the probability of Rachel's baby being one of those 38 babies is:  Probability = Number of babies / Total number of babies born on that day = 38/140 = 0.2714 (approximately)  Finally, we multiply the probability by 100 to convert it into a percentage:  Percentage = x * 100 = 0.2714 * 100 = 27.14%  Therefore, the answer to the question is approximately 27.14%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 82 students in total who passed the entrance examination for Buckingham University.  Of these, 40 students were selected to study at the university.  Therefore, the number of students who did not pass the entrance examination is: $82 - 40 = 42$ students.  Now, let's find out how many students studied at the university last year. According to the passage, there were $16 \times 3 = 48$ students who studied at the university last year.  So, the difference between the number of students who studied at the university last year and the number of students who did not pass the entrance examination is: $48 - 42 = 6$ students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 120 students in total, including Rachel and her friends.  Among them, 80 students have already taken their exams, which means they have finished their exams.  Now, let's calculate how many students are left to take their exams based on the information given in the question:  If 40 students are taking their exams every day, and there are still 40 days left for the exam season (i.e., from Monday to Sunday), then the number of students who will take their exams is:  Number of students = Total number of students - Number of students who have already taken their exams  Number of students = 120 - 80  Number of students = 40 So, there are 40 students left to take their exams.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 186 students in total who took the examination at Buckingham Palace.  Among them, 30 students passed the examination and became Prince or Princess of Wales. Therefore, the number of students who did not pass the examination is: $ \text {Number of students who did not pass the examination} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of students who passed the examination} $ $ \text{Total number of students} = 186 $ $ \text{Number of students who passed the examination} = 30 $ So, the number of students who did not pass the examination is: $ \text {Number of students who did not pass the examination} = 156 $ Now, let's find out how many students were absent from the examination on that day. We know that there were 24 absences among the 186 students. Therefore, the number of students who were absent from the examination is: $ \text {Number of students who were absent from the examination} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of students who passed the examination} - $\text{Number of students who were absent from the examination}$ $ \text{Total number of students} = 186 $ $ \text{Number of students who passed the examination} = 30 $ $ \text{Number of students who were absent from the examination} = 24 $ So, the number of students who attended the examination is: $ \text {Number of students who attended the examination} = \text{Total number of students} - $\text{Number of students who passed the examination} - $\text{Number of students who were absent from the examination}$ $ \text{Total number of students} = 186 $ $ \text{Number of students who passed the examination} = 30 $ $ \text{Number of students who were absent from the examination} = 24 $ Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: $ \text {Number of students who attended the examination} = 186 - 30 - 24 $ $ = 132 $ Therefore, there were 132 students who attended
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: March 20, 1975 - Date of the second event: April 18, 1975 = 13 days  Therefore, there are 13 days between the two events.
Response:  We know that there are 14 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, we have 14 x 24 = 312 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours the person spent studying per day.

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  The date of the incident is December 24, 1979, and the date when the suspect was arrested is January 3, 1980.  Therefore, the difference between these two dates is 3 days.  Next, we need to calculate how many weeks are there between these two dates.  There are 7 days in a week, so the number of weeks between these two dates can be calculated as follows: 3 days / 7 days/week = 0.43 weeks.  Finally, we need to convert this value from weeks to months.  There are 4.33 weeks in one month, so the number of months between these two dates can be calculated as follows: 0.43 weeks / 4.33 weeks/month = 0.10 months.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 0.10 months.

Therefore, the answer is: 5 months = 183 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days that have passed since the person was born. We know that they were born on February 20th, so today is March 3rd. Therefore, the total number of days that have passed is: 23 (February 20th - March 3rd).  Next, we need to calculate the number of days that the person has been alive. Since their birthday is on February 20th, and today is March 3rd, the person has been alive for: 23 + 58 = 81 days.  Finally, we need to calculate the number of hours that the person has been awake. If it takes 24 hours for one day, then the person has been awake for: 81 days x 24 hours/day = 1972 hours.
Response:  The question asks about the number of days it took for 235 apples to ripen. We are given that the apples were picked at dawn on day 221 and it takes 10 days for them to ripe completely. So, we can calculate the number of days it took for the apples to ripen as follows: Day 221 + (10 x 7) = 231 Days Therefore, it took 231 days for the apples to ripen from the time they were picked until they were fully ripe.

Response:  We know that there are 13 shirts in total and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 3 shirts (13 / 4 = 3).
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many t-shirts can be made from one kilogram of cotton.  One kilogram of cotton is equal to 100 grams. So, if we want to make a t-shirt, we need at least 50 grams of cotton for each t-shirt (assuming that the t-shirt will have two layers). Therefore, we can produce 50 t-shirts from one kilogram of cotton.  Now, let's calculate how much cotton is needed to make 400 t-shirts. We know that 1 kilogram of cotton is equivalent to 400 grams, so we need 400 / 50 = 8 kilograms of cotton to make 400 t-shirts.

So, there are $15! = 35944$ possible combinations."
Response:  We know that there are 10 questions in total.  For each question, we have to choose one of the options A, B, C, or D. So, the probability of choosing the correct option for each question is 1/4. Therefore, the expected value of the number of correct answers is: E(X) = 10 x (1/4)^10 = 25.  Since X is a discrete random variable, its possible values are 0, 1, 2,..., 10. The probability mass function (pmf) of X is: f(x) = 10 choices out of 10 options, so f(x) = 1/10 for all x. Now, we want to find P(X = k), which is the probability that exactly k correct answers will be chosen. Using the formula for the sum of a binomial distribution, we get: P(X = k) = (10 choose k) x (1/10)^k x (9/10)^(10-k). Substituting k = 2, we get: P(X = 2) = (10 choose 2) x (1/10)^2 x (9/10)^8 = 0.375. Therefore, the probability that exactly two correct answers will be chosen is 0.375 or 37.5%.
Response:  We know that there are 4 boys and 36 girls in the class. So, the total number of students is: 4 + 36 = 40. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of friends each boy has. Since there are 4 boys, they can make 4 x 36 = 144 pairs of friends with the girls. Therefore, the number of friends each boy has is 144 / 4 = 36.
Response:  If an individual has 36 teeth and loses 2 teeth every year, how many teeth will they have after 10 years?  To calculate this, we can use the formula: Number of teeth = Initial number of teeth - (Annual loss x Number of years) In this case, the initial number of teeth is 36, and the annual loss is 2 teeth. Therefore, if the person has lost 2 teeth every year for 10 years, their final number of teeth would be: Number of teeth = 36 - (2 x 10) = 36 - 20 = 16 So, after 10 years, the person will have 16 teeth left.
Response:  We know that there are 41 people who have not received any vaccine doses and 53 people who have received at least one dose of vaccine.

So, the probability of choosing the correct option for each question is 1/4.  Now, let's calculate the probability of getting all 20 questions correct:  P(all correct) = (1/4)^20 = 1/16000. Therefore, the expected number of questions answered correctly is 1/16000.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of years that the king has reigned for. The question states that he became king at the age of 30 and reigned for 38 years. Therefore, the total number of years he has reigned for is:  38 years = 30 + 38 = 68 years  Next, we need to find out how many times the king has celebrated his birthday during his reign. According to the question, he celebrates his birthday every year, so the number of times he has celebrated his birthday is equal to the number of years he has reigned for. Hence, the number of times the king has celebrated his birthday is:  68 years x 1 = 68 times  Finally, we need to find out how many candles are on the cake that the king is blowing out. According to the question, there are 30 candles on the cake. Therefore, the answer is:  68 times x 30 = 2040 candles

Response:  We are given that there are 4 options for the number of balls in the bag: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Since we want to choose one ball from the bag randomly without looking inside, the probability of choosing each option is equal. Therefore, the probability of choosing any particular ball (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is 1/4.  Now, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from the bag:  There are 4 choices for the first ball and 3 choices for the second ball, since there are already 1 ball chosen. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls is: 4 x 3 = 12.  Finally, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 balls from the bag:  Again, there are 4 choices for the first ball, 3 choices for the second ball, and 2 choices for the third ball, since there are already 1 ball chosen. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls is: 4 x 3 x 2 = 24.  Therefore, the answer is:  The number of balls in the bag is 4.

"Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebecca has 4 friends and each friend has an average of 3.7 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets owned by Rebecca's friends is: 4 x 3.7 = 15.8. However, since you said ""at least"", so the actual number of pets owned by Rebecca's friends could be more than 15.8."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebecca is 18 years old and has been working for 72 months. Therefore, her total work experience is 72 x 12 = 864 months.  Next, we are asked how many times she has received a raise. We can calculate this by dividing the number of raises she has received (66) by the number of months she has worked (864). So, Rebecca has received a raise approximately every 13 months on average.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebecca has 3 companies under her management, which are Company A, B and C.  Each of these companies has an average of 80 employees, so there are in total 240 employees working for Rebecca (3 x 80 = 240).  Now, let's consider how many managers each company has. According to the question, each manager oversees 10 employees, so there are in total 24 managers working for Rebecca (3 x 10 = 30). Therefore, the final answer is: Number of managers working for Rebecca = 30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebecca has 20 years of work experience and she is currently 35 years old (6 + 29). Therefore, her age at the time of retirement will be 6 + 20 = 26 years old.

So, the number of people who have won the game at least 3 times is: 78 x 2 = 156  Therefore, the answer is 156.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emily has two children, and each child has three siblings. Therefore, in total, Emily has six grandchildren.  Secondly, we are asked whether Emily can take care of all her grandchildren at once. Unfortunately, it is not possible for Emily to do so because she is only one person, and there are thirty-two grandchildren in total (six grandchildren x three siblings per grandchild). So, the answer is no, Emily cannot take care of all her grandchildren at once.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emily has been working at the company for 5 years (Year 1- Year 5). Secondly, she has taken 2 months of maternity leave (Month 6 and Month 7) after giving birth to her child. Therefore, the total number of months that Emily has worked at the company is: 5 + 2 = 7 months.
Response:  We know that Emily has 8 friends and each friend has 2 pets. So, in total, Emily has 8 x 2 = 16 pets.  Therefore, Emily can take care of 16 pets at most.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emily can do 18 push-ups in total. Then, we are asked how many push-ups she can do per minute. To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of push-ups (18) by the time taken to complete them (minutes). So, if it takes her 3 minutes to complete 18 push-ups, then she can do 6 push-ups per minute (18/3 = 6).

According to the passage, 208 of these students have scholarships, which means that 106 students do not have scholarships (208 - 106 = 0). Therefore, the answer is 0.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group of friends.  There are 8 groups of friends, and each group has an average of 5 members (including the person who is asking the question). Therefore, there are 8 x 5 = 40 people in total. Next, we need to calculate the number of people who have been invited to the party. According to the question, 32 people have RSVPed ""yes,"" which means that they will definitely attend the party. However, there are also some people who have not responded yet or have declined the invitation. So, let's assume that there are 18 unresponsive people (i.e., those who have not replied or declined the invitation). Therefore, the total number of people attending the party is 32 + 18 = 50 people."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 students in total, including Lawrence and his friends.  Among them, 8 students have already taken their exams, leaving 28 students who still need to take their exams.  Now, let's calculate the number of students who will be taking their exams at the designated time.  We know that each student needs to take their exam at least once every two weeks, so the maximum number of students who can take their exams at any given time is 14 (since there are only 28 students left).  Therefore, the answer is 14.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the village of រដូវឈប់សម្រាករដូវក្តៅ (Raung). According to the question, there are 40 houses in Raung and each house has an average of 5 members per household. Therefore, the total number of people living in Raung is:

Number of households = 40
Average number of members per household = 5
Total population of Raung = Number of households x Average number of members per household
= 40 x 5
= 200

Now let's move on to the second part of the question which asks about the location of the village of ក្នុងរដូវឈប់សម្រាករដូវក្តៅ (Khmer). We know that Khmer is located near Raung because it is mentioned in the question as being ""near"" Raung. So, we can assume that Khmer is somewhere close to Raung. However, we don't have any information about the exact distance between Raung and Khmer or the direction they are from each other. Therefore, we cannot provide an accurate answer to this part of the question."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the group of friends who went to the beach together. According to the question, there were 34 people in total, including the boy and his friends. So, the number of friends is 34. Next, we need to determine how many of them are boys. The question states that there were 18 boys among the group of friends, which means that the number of boys is 18. Finally, we need to calculate the ratio of boys to girls in the group. Since there were 18 boys and 16 girls, the ratio of boys to girls is 18:16 or 3:2. Therefore, the answer is 3/2.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the group of Lawrence. According to the question, there are 28 people in total, and they all live together in one house. So, the number of people in the group of Lawrence is 28. Next, we need to calculate the average age of the people in the group. Based on the information provided, the average age of the people in the group is 30 years old. Therefore, the answer is 28 x 30 = 840.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group of friends.  Based on the information provided, there are 6 groups of friends with an average size of 10 members per group. Therefore, the total number of people in all the groups is:

$$ \text {Total number of people} = 6 \times 10 = 60 $$

Now, let's calculate the probability that exactly $x$ people from each group will go together. Since there are $60$ people in total, and each group has an average of $10$ people, the probability of exactly $x$ people going together from one group is:

$$ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose } x\text{ people from one group}}{\text{Total number of people}} $$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$ \text{Probability} = \frac{\binom{10}{x}}{60} $$

Therefore, the probability that exactly $x$ people from each group will go together is $\frac{\binom{10}{x}}{60}$."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many letters are there in each word of the sentence.  The words ""អាដាមមាន"" and ""ផ្លែប៉ោម"" contain 8 and 7 letters respectively.  Next, we need to count the number of letters that are common between these two words.  There are 5 letters which are common between them, i.e., A, E, I, O, and U.  Finally, we multiply the total number of letters in both words by the ratio of common letters to get the result.  Therefore, the answer is 5 x (8 + 7) = 49."
Response:  We have 10 balls (balls A to J). Each ball has a number from 1 to 10 printed on it. There are 20 numbers in total (1 to 10 twice). So, there are 20 possible combinations of numbers that can be printed on the balls. Now, we draw two balls without replacement. The probability of drawing any particular combination of numbers is 1/20 since there are only 20 possibilities. Therefore, the probability of drawing the same combination of numbers as before is 1/20 × 1/20 = 1/400.
Response:  We know that there are 8 balls in total and we have already counted 4 of them as belonging to Jackie (Jackie has 4 balls). So, the number of balls left is 8 - 4 = 4. Now, let's count how many balls belong to Adam. According to the question, Adam has 10 balls. Therefore, the number of balls belonging to Adam is 10. Finally, we add up all the balls owned by both Jackie and Adam to get the total number of balls they own together: 4 + 10 = 14.
Response:  We know that there are 10 balls in total (balls A to J).  Among them, ball B has been given to Jackie. So, we can say that Jackie has 1/10 of the total number of balls, which is 10%. Now, let's calculate the percentage of balls that Adam has. Since he has 3 balls out of 10, his percentage is 30% (3/10 x 100%). Therefore, the answer is 40%.
Response:  We know that there are 10 questions in total.  For each question, we have to choose one of the options A, B, C or D. So, the probability of choosing the correct option for each question is 1/4. Now, let's calculate the probability of getting all 10 questions correct:  P(correct) = (1/4)^10 = 1/16 Since there are 16 possible outcomes, the chance of getting all 10 questions correct is 1/16. Therefore, the probability of passing the test is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.

Next, we need to count how many times each letter of ""Helen"" appears in the text. The letters appear as follows: H - 2, E - 3, L - 2, E - 1, N - 2. Therefore, there are 2 H's, 3 E's, 2 L's, 1 E, and 2 N's in total. Finally, we add up all these numbers to get our answer: 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9. So, the answer is 9."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of years that have passed since Helen was born. According to the question, she was born in 1927 and is now 96 years old. Therefore, the number of years that have passed since her birth is:  1927 - 2023 = 96 years  Next, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since Helen turned 85 years old. According to the question, she turned 85 in 2018, so the number of days that have passed since then is:  2018 - 2023 = 5 years x 365 days/year = 1825 days  Finally, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since Helen reached the age of 100 years old. According to the question, she will reach this milestone in 2033, so the number of days that have passed since then is:  2033 - 2023 = 10 years x 365 days/year = 3650 days  In conclusion, the total number of days that have passed since Helen was born until present is:  96 + 1825 + 3650 = 5871 days
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""Helen"" appears in the text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of the name ""Helen"" in the given text. After counting, we will get 10 occurrences of the name ""Helen"". Now, let's count how many times each letter of the alphabet appears in the text. We can do this by dividing the total number of letters in the text by the number of letters in each word. For example, if there are 5 letters in each word, then we divide the total number of letters in the text (26) by 5 to get the number of words in the text (5). Similarly, if there are 7 letters in each word, then we divide 26 by 7 to get 3.5 words. So, based on these calculations, we have approximately 3.5 words containing the name ""Helen"". Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  The date of birth of Helen is July 28, 1904, and her age at death is 75 years old, which means she was born on July 28, 1904, and died on January 13, 1975.  Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:  July 28, 1904 - January 13, 1975 = 75 years  Next, we need to convert this difference into months.  There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide the difference by 12 to get the number of months: 75 years / 12 months/year = 6 months  Finally, we multiply the result by the number of days in a month to get the total number of days: 6 months x 30 days/month = 180 days  Therefore, the answer to the question is 180 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between 28th February and 31st March. There are 7 days in total.  Next, we need to calculate how many times Helen has taken her bath during those 7 days. According to the question, she took her bath every day, so the answer is 7.  Finally, we need to multiply the number of days (7) with the number of times Helen took her bath (7), which gives us a total of 49. Therefore, the answer to the question is 49.
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 points and her friend has 59 points. So, to find out how many more points Katie has than her friend, we subtract the number of points her friend has from the number of points Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie has 22 more points than her friend.
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 friends in her DS group and 88 of them are boys. So, the number of girls in Katie's DS group is 91 - 88 = 13.  Now, we also know that each girl in Katie's DS group has an average of 53 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends that all the girls in Katie's DS group have is 13 x 53 = 697.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 hats and 86 scarves.  Each hat takes up 3 square feet of space, and each scarf takes up 2 square feet of space. So, to find out how many items Katie can fit in her closet, we need to calculate the total volume of all the items she owns. The formula for the volume of an object is length x width x height (in cubic units). For a hat, the length and width are both 3 feet, so the volume is 3 x 3 = 9 cubic feet. For a scarf, the length and width are both 2 feet, so the volume is 2 x 2 = 4 cubic feet. Therefore, the total volume of all Katie's hats is 9 x 78 = 692 cubic feet, and the total volume of all her scarves is 4 x 86 = 332 cubic feet. Now, let's convert these volumes to square feet. There are 1,728 square feet in a cubic foot, so the total volume of Katie's hats in square feet is 692 / 1,728 = 0.405 acres, and the total volume of her scarves in square feet is 332 / 1,728 = 0.192 acres. Finally, to find out how many items Katie can fit in her closet, we divide the total volume of all her items by the volume of her closet. Based on the information provided earlier, the volume of Katie's closet is 100 cubic feet. Therefore, Katie can fit approximately 0.405 acres of hats + 0.192 acres of scarves = 0.597 acres of items in her closet.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 84 hats and 19 scarves.  Each hat takes up 3 square feet of space, so the total amount of space taken up by her hats is:

84 x 3 = 252 square feet

Similarly, each scarf takes up 0.75 square feet of space, so the total amount of space taken up by her scarves is:

19 x 0.75 = 14.25 square feet

Now, let's calculate the total amount of space taken up by all of Katie's clothes:

Total space for hats = 252 square feet
Total space for scarves = 14.25 square feet
Total space for all clothes = Total space for hats + Total space for scarves
= 252 + 14.25
= 266.25 square feet

So, Katie's clothes take up 266.25 square feet of space in her closet."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of balls that Katie has. We are given that she has 62 red balls and 80 blue balls, so the total number of balls is:

Total number of balls = 62 + 80 = 142

Next, we need to find out how many balls are in each bag. From the question, we know that there are 73 balls in one bag and 41 balls in another bag. So, the total number of balls in both bags is:

Total number of balls in both bags = 73 + 41 = 114

Finally, we need to subtract the number of balls in the smaller bag from the total number of balls to get the number of extra balls that Katie has:

Number of extra balls = Total number of balls - Number of balls in smaller bag
= 142 - 114
= 28

Therefore, Katie has 28 extra balls."
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 balls and her friend has 63 balls. So, we need to find out how many more balls Katie's friend has than Katie. To do this, we can subtract the number of balls Katie has from the number of balls her friend has: 63 - 57 = 8 Therefore, Katie's friend has 8 more balls than Katie.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 hats and 39 scarves.  Each hat is worth $10, and each scarf is worth $20. So, the total value of Katie's hats is:  57 x $10 = $570  And the total value of Katie's scarves is:  39 x $20 = $780  Therefore, the total value of Katie's clothes is: $570 + $780 = $1350
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 60 marbles and Jason has 19 marbles.  Since Jason borrowed some of Fred's marbles, let's assume he took 33 marbles from Fred.  Therefore, the total number of marbles Jason now has is:  60 (Fred's original) - 19 (Jason's original) + 33 (marbles taken from Fred) = 127 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 86 balls and Jason has 5 balls. Since Fred gave some of his balls to Jason, let's assume that he gave him 40 balls (since 86 - 40 = 46). Now, we have a total of 126 balls (Fred's original 86 + Jason's 40). Next, we are told that Jason did not return any balls to Fred. Therefore, the number of balls that Jason had after receiving them from Fred is equal to the number of balls he originally had, which is 5. So, the final answer is: 126 - 5 = 121 balls.
Response:  We know that Fred has 19 balls and Jason has 16 balls. So far, we have a total of 35 balls (19 + 16). Now, let's consider how many more balls Fred has than Jason. Since Fred has 40 balls in total, and Jason has 69 balls in total, we can calculate the difference between their number of balls as follows:  Difference = 40 - 69 = -29 balls. Therefore, the answer is -29.
Response:  We know that Fred has 114 balls and Jason has 22 balls. So, if we want to find out how many more balls Jason has than Fred, we can subtract the number of balls Fred has from the number of balls Jason has: 22 - 114 = -92. Therefore, Jason has 92 fewer balls than Fred.
Response:  We know that Fred has 111 balls and Jason has 40 balls.  Since Fred has more balls than Jason, we can say that Fred's total score is greater than Jason's total score.  Therefore, the difference between their scores is: 111 - 40 = 71 balls.  So, Fred's score is 71 balls more than Jason's score.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 49 balls and he gave 12 to Jason. So, the number of balls left with Fred is 49 - 12 = 37.  Next, we know that Jason received 63 balls from someone else. Therefore, the total number of balls possessed by Jason is 37 + 63 = 100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 78 balls and Jason has 31 balls.  Secondly, we are told that Jason won 14 balls from Fred. Therefore, the number of balls left with Fred is 78 - 14 = 64 balls. Lastly, we are asked how many balls Fred had before he lost them to Jason. So, the answer is 64 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 33 balls and Jason has 95 balls.  To find out how many more balls Jason has than Fred, we can subtract the number of balls Fred has from the number of balls Jason has:  95 - 33 = 62  So, Jason has 62 more balls than Fred.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has 47 balls and Jason has 99 balls.  Therefore, if Fred gives 1/3 of his balls to Jason, he will give 47 / 3 = 15 balls to Jason.  So, after giving these balls to Jason, Fred will have remaining 47 - 15 = 32 balls left with him.  Now, let's calculate how many balls Jason will have after receiving these 15 balls from Fred. Since Jason already had 99 balls, adding the 15 balls he received from Fred, he will have a total of 99 + 15 = 114 balls.  Therefore, the final answer is:  Fred gave 15 balls to Jason.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 23 years old and she is currently working as an accountant at a company. She earns $40,000 per year and her monthly salary is $3,333.33 (based on a 12-month calendar). Since she started working in January 2022, she has worked for approximately 23 months so far. Therefore, her total income since starting work until now can be calculated as follows: Total Income = Monthly Salary x Number of Months Worked = $3,333.33 x 23 months = $75,000 So, to answer your question, Jessie has earned around $75,000 in total since starting work in January 2022.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 20 years old and she is currently in grade 12.  Secondly, we are told that she will graduate from high school in 3 years (i.e., in 2025). Thirdly, we are given that she wants to study abroad for her bachelor's degree. Finally, we are informed that she plans to start her studies in 2026. Now, let's calculate the time difference between when Jessie graduates from high school and when she starts her studies abroad:  Graduation year: 2025 Start of studies abroad: 2026 Time difference: 1 year Therefore, the answer is A) 1 year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 36 friends and each friend has 8 followers. Therefore, the total number of people who followed Jessie is 36 x 8 = 288.  Next, we are told that Jessie gained 10 new followers every day. So, in one week (7 days), she gained 10 x 7 = 70 new followers.  Finally, we are asked how many followers Jessie had after 3 weeks (21 days). To find this out, we need to add up all the numbers of followers she gained during those three weeks: 70 + 70 + 70 = 210.  Therefore, Jessie had 210 followers after 3 weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 14 dogs and cats.  Secondly, she wants to donate $500 to each of the two animal shelters. Therefore, the total amount of money she will give away is: $\$500 \times 2 = \$1000$.  Finally, we are asked how much money Jessie will have left after making these donations. To calculate this, we need to subtract the amount she gave away ($1000) from the original amount of money she had ($1600): $\$1600 - \$1000 = \$600$. So, Jessie will have $\$600$ left after making the donations.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 days in a week and 24 hours in a day. So, if the baby was born at night (between 6 pm to 6 am), then the number of days since birth would be: $8 \times 24 = 192$ days. However, if the baby was born during the daytime ( between 6 am to 6 pm), then the number of days since birth would be: $8 \times 24 = 192$ days. Therefore, the correct answer is: $192$ days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 82 kg of rice and she wants to distribute it equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 8.2 kg of rice (82/10).  Now, let's consider the second part of the question where Jessie wants to give some extra rice to her mother-in-law. We are told that Jessie's mother-in-law is old and needs more food, so Jessie decides to give her an additional 30 kg of rice. Since there are already 8.2 kg of rice given to the 10 people earlier, now Jessie has 73.8 kg of rice left (82 - 8.2 = 73.8). Therefore, the total amount of rice Jessie has after giving some to her mother-in-law is 73.8 kg.
Response:  We know that there are 86 students in total and they have to take 40 exams. So, each student has to take an average of 2.1 exam per day (86/40). Now, let's calculate how many hours each student spends taking exams per day. There are 24 hours in a day, so each student spends ⅕ of their time taking exams (24/8 = 3). Therefore, if we assume that each exam takes 3 hours to complete, then each student completes 3 x 2.1 = 6.3 exams per day.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in total between the two dates given in the question.  We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  The difference is 30 days.  Now, let's count how many times the moon appears during these 30 days.  According to the question, the moon appears 13 times during these 30 days.  Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 3 months and 18 days. There are 30 days in one month, so there are 3 x 30 = 90 days in 3 months. Now, we add 18 days to it, which gives us a total of 90 + 18 = 108 days. Therefore, the answer is 108 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the group of friends who went to the beach together. According to the question, there were 79 people in total at the beach. Among them, 24 people had their own umbrellas and 16 people shared an umbrella. Therefore, the number of people without umbrellas is: 79 - (24 + 16) = 59 people. Now, let's calculate the probability that each person has an umbrella. There were 24 people with their own umbrellas, so the probability of having an umbrella for each person in this group is 24/59 = 0.41. Similarly, among the remaining 35 people, 16 people shared an umbrella, so the probability of having no umbrella for each person in this group is 35 / (35 - 16) = 0.69. Finally, we add these two probabilities to get the overall probability that each person has an umbrella: 0.41 + 0.69 = 0.89 or approximately 89%.
Response:  We know that there are 134 days in a year and 30 days in a month. So, if we want to calculate how many times a certain event happens every day of the year, we need to divide the number of events (134) by the number of days in a year (365). Therefore, the answer is:  Event occurs approximately once every 134/365 = 0.37 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group (A and B).  From the given information, Group A has 30 members, and Group B has 20 members.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of pairs that can be formed between these two groups.  To do this, we multiply the number of members in each group by the number of other groups they can pair with.  For Group A, there are 19 other groups they can pair with (since they have 30 members and there are 56 total groups), so the number of pairs for Group A is 30 x 19 = 570.  Similarly, for Group B, there are 41 other groups they can pair with (since they have 20 members and there are 56 total groups), so the number of pairs for Group B is 20 x 41 = 820.  Finally, we add up all the numbers of pairs for both groups to get the total number of pairs: 570 + 820 = 1,390.
Response:  We have to find out how many people can fit in a car that has 8 seats and how many cars are available for rent per day.  Based on the information provided, there are 154 people who want to go to the beach and they need to be transported in 50 cars. So, we can calculate the number of people each car can accommodate as follows: Number of people each car can accommodate = Total number of people / Number of cars available for rent per day Number of people each car can accommodate = 154 / 50 = 3.08 people per car Therefore, approximately 3.08 people can fit in each car.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates mentioned in the question.  The first date is January 16, 2023, and the second date is August 18, 2023.  Therefore, the difference between these two dates is:

January 16, 2023 - August 18, 2023 = 154 days

So, the answer to the question is:

There are 154 days between January 16, 2023, and August 18, 2023."
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people are in each group (A and B).  From the given information, Group A has 38 people, and Group B has 42 people.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of friends that can be formed between them.  For this, we multiply the number of people in each group by the number of other groups they can form pairs with.  So for Group A, there are 42 - 38 = 4 groups they cannot form pairs with, so they can form pairs with 4 x 38 = 152 people. Similarly, for Group B, there are 38 - 42 = -6 groups they cannot form pairs with, so they can form pairs with 6 x 42 = 252 people.  Therefore, the total number of pairs of friends that can be formed is 152 + 252 = 404 pairs.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of Cambodian people who have been infected with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 2023, there were 106 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Cambodia. Therefore, the number of Cambodian people who have been infected with COVID-19 is 106.  Next, we need to calculate the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in Cambodia. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any reliable data on this topic from reputable sources such as WHO or the Cambodian Ministry of Health. However, according to a report by the Cambodia Daily on February 27, 2020, there were at least six deaths related to COVID-19 in Cambodia. So, the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in Cambodia is likely between six and ten.  Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of Cambodian people who have died due to COVID-19 out of the total population of Cambodia. To do this, we divide the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 by the estimated population of Cambodia, which was around 16.5 million in 2020, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This gives us a percentage of approximately 0.0034% or 0.34%.  Therefore, based on these calculations, the answer to the question is 0.34%.

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth (January 20, 1943) from the date of death (February 15, 2016).  Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:  January 20, 1943 - February 15, 2016 = 73,333 days  Now, we need to divide the total number of days by 365 to get the approximate number of years: 73,333 days / 365 days per year = approximately 203 years  So, based on the information provided in the question, John lived for approximately 203 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: January 10, 2022  Date of the second event: March 15, 2022  Subtracting these two dates gives us:  January 10, 2022 - March 15, 2022 = 45 days  Therefore, there are 45 days between the two events.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days that John has been working at his current job. According to the question, he started working there 10 years ago, and he works for 6 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days in 10 years is:

$$ \text {Total days} = \frac{\text{Years}}{\text{Days per week}} \times \text{Number of weeks in } \text{Years} $$

In this case, $ \text{Years} = 10 $ years, $\text{Days per week} = 6 $ days/week, and $ \text{Number of weeks in } \text{Years} = 10 \times 52 = 520 $ weeks.

So, the total number of days John has worked at his current job is:

$$ \text {Total days} = \frac{10}{6} \times 520 = 31200 $$

Now, let's find out how many hours John has worked during these 31200 days. According to the question, he works for 8 hours a day, so:

$$ \text {Hours worked} = \text {Total days} \times \text {Hours per day} $$

Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:

$$ \text {Hours worked} = 31200 \times 8 = 250400 $$

Therefore, John has worked for approximately 250400 hours at his current job over the past 10 years."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many ways there are to choose one person from 5 people (John, Sarah, Emily, David, and Tom). There are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible combinations.  Next, we need to find out how many ways there are to choose two people from 16 people (including John, Sarah, Emily, David, Tom, and 12 other people). There are 16! = 16 × 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 = 378,496 possible combinations.  Therefore, the answer is 120 + 378,496 = 379,616.

"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times ""សម្រាប់"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each word in the text using the following formula:

Number of occurrences = Total number of words - Number of unique words

In this case, there are 125 words in the text, and there are 7 unique words (including ""សម្រាប់""). Therefore, the number of occurrences of ""សម្រាប់"" is:

Number of occurrences = 125 - 7 = 118

Now, let's count the number of times ""សម្រាប់"" appears after the word ""ពី"":

Number of occurrences after ""ពី"" = 118 - 30 = 88

Finally, we need to divide the total number of occurrences by the number of occurrences after ""ពី"" to get the average frequency of ""សម្រាប់"" in the given text:

Average frequency = 88 / 118 = 0.76

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Response:  We know that there are 4 years in a term of office for a member of parliament (MP). So, if Robin has been an MP for 4 terms, then he has served as an MP for a total of 4 x 4 = 16 years.  Now, we need to calculate how many times Robin has won the election. The question states that he has won the election 8 times. Therefore, we can conclude that Robin has won the election 8/16 = 0.5 times per year, on average.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin has 7 pets (cats).  Secondly, each cat has an average of 4 kittens per litter, so there are 28 kittens in total from all 7 cats. Thirdly, since each kitten grows at a rate of 0.5 kg/week, and there are 28 kittens in total, then the total weight of all kittens is 28 x 0.5 = 14 kg/week. Fourthly, since Robin feeds them twice a day, the amount of food they eat per day is 14 kg / 2 = 7 kg/day. Fifthly, since Robin feeds them for 3 months, the total amount of food he gives to his pets is 7 kg/day x 90 days = 630 kg. Lastly, since each bag of dog food costs $20, then the total cost of feeding all his pets for 3 months is 630 kg x $20/kg = $12,600. Therefore, the answer is $12,600.
Response:  We know that Robin is 28 years old and has been working for 13 years. So, he has worked for 28 + 13 = 41 years in total. Now, we need to calculate how many days he has worked. There are 365 days in a year, so we can calculate the number of days worked as follows: Number of days worked = Total work experience x Number of days in a year = 41 years x 365 days/year = 15,075 days Worked.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 cats and 45 dogs.  Each cat has 9 kittens, so we have:  21 x 9 = 189 kittens  And each dog has 9 puppies, so we have:  45 x 9 = 375 puppies  Therefore, the total number of offspring produced by Robin is:  189 + 375 = 564 offspring
Response:  We know that Robin is 28 years old and has been working for 14 years. Therefore, we can calculate his age as follows:  Age = 28 + (14 x 6) = 30 + 84 = 114 years old. So, Robin is 114 years old based on this calculation.

"Response:  We know that there are 382 days in 44 weeks, so we can calculate the number of days as follows:

Number of days = 382 days / 44 weeks = 8.5 days per week

Now, let's find out how many times the person worked for 10 hours per day during this period:

Number of times working for 10 hours/day = Total number of days / Number of days worked per day = 8.5 days/week x 52 weeks/year = 430 days/year

Finally, to find out how much money the person earned, we need to multiply the number of days worked with the hourly wage:

Total amount earned = Hourly wage x Number of days worked = $X x 430 days/year = $X/year

Since the person worked for 10 hours per day, their hourly wage is:

Hourly wage = Annual salary / Number of days worked per year = $X/year / 430 days/year = $X/hour

So, the person earned $X per hour."

Each person is mentioned once, except for one person who is mentioned twice, so the total number of mentions is 1 + 2 = 3.  Therefore, the answer is 12 / 3 = 4.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group (A and B). We know that there are 18 people in Group A and 20 people in Group B. Next, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of people who are either both in Group A or both in Group B. There are 36 such pairs (since there are 18 people in Group A and 20 people in Group B). Finally, we need to subtract the number of pairs of people who are both in the same group from the total number of pairs to get the number of pairs of people who are in different groups. Therefore, the answer is 36 - 18 = 18.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in the group of friends who went to the beach together. According to the question, there were 40 people in total, including the narrator and his/her friends. So, the number of people in the group is 40. Next, we need to calculate the number of people who have not received any gifts from their friends. The question states that only 20 people did not receive any gifts, so the number of people who have not received any gifts is 20. Therefore, the final answer is 40 - 20 = 20 people.
Response:  We are given that there are 919 students in total and we need to find out how many of them have passed the exam. So, the number of students who have passed the exam is equal to the number of students who got more than 1307 marks out of 1500. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students who passed = Total number of students - Number of students who scored less than 1307 marks Now, let's substitute the values we know into this equation: Number of students who passed = 919 - x Where x is the number of students who scored less than 1307 marks. Since there are 1307 students who scored less than 1307 marks, we can say that x = 1307. Substituting this value back into our equation, we get: Number of students who passed = 919 - 1307 = -482 Now, since the number of students who passed is negative, it means that none of the students passed the exam. Therefore, the answer is (None).
"Response:  We know that $x = 1218$ and $y = 849$.  To find the least common multiple (LCM) of $x$ and $y$, we need to list the multiples of each number and find the smallest number that is common to both lists.  The multiples of $x$ are:

$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 \times 1218 & = & 1218 \\
2 \times 1218 & = & 2436 \\
3 \times 1218 & = & 3654 \\
4 \times 1218 & = & 4872 \\
5 \times 1218 & = & 6088 \\
6 \times 1218 & = & 7296 \\
7 \times 1218 & = & 8494 \\
8 \times 1218 & = & 9692 \\
9 \times 1218 & = & 10880 \\
10 \times 1218 & = & 12072 \\
\end{array}$$
The multiples of $y$ are:

$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 \times 849 & = & 849 \\
2 \times 849 & = & 1698 \\
3 \times 849 & = & 2547 \\
4 \times 849 & = & 3396 \\
5 \times 849 & = & 4245 \\
6 \times 849 & = & 5094 \\
7 \times 849 & = & 5943 \\
8 \times 849 & = & 6792 \\
9 \times 849 & = & 7641 \\
10 \times 849 & = & 8490 \\
\end{array}$$
The least common multiple of $x$ and $y$ is the smallest number that appears in both lists, which is $849$. Therefore"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between 659 and 762. We can do this by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one:

762 - 659 = 103

So, there are 103 days difference between 659 and 762."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paige has 4 friends who are also her classmates.  Secondly, each of these friends has their own unique personality traits and characteristics. Thirdly, based on the information provided in the question, it is clear that Paige values diversity and inclusivity. Therefore, she would likely choose to spend time with each of her friends in different ways, depending on their individual personalities and interests. For example, if one of her friends is very outgoing and loves to be around people, Paige might invite them to go to a social event or party together. On the other hand, if another friend is more introverted and prefers quieter activities, Paige might suggest doing something low-key like going for a walk or having a movie night at home. By spending time with each of her friends in different ways, Paige can show appreciation and respect for their individuality while still maintaining a strong bond with all of them.
Response:  We know that Paige has 30 friends and she wants to invite them all to her birthday party. So, we need to find out how many groups of 4 people each can be formed from these 30 friends. To do this, we divide 30 by 4: 30 / 4 = 7.5. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number: 7.5 rounded up is 8. Therefore, Paige can invite 8 groups of 4 people each to her birthday party.
Response:  We know that Paige has 12 friends and each friend has an average of 3 pets. So, in total, there are 12 x 3 = 36 pets.  Now, we need to find out how many dogs among those 36 pets. Since dogs are the most common pet, let's assume that half of the pets are dogs (which is a rough estimate). Therefore, the number of dogs among the 36 pets is 36 / 2 = 18.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paige has 16 years old and she is in Grade 9.  Secondly, we are told that her height is 158 cm which is equivalent to 1.58 meters. Finally, we are asked how many times taller than Paige is the tallest tree in Cambodia, which is said to be 40 meters high. Therefore, we can calculate the number of times taller as follows: Height of tallest tree / Height of Paige = 40 m / 1.58 m = 25.3 times taller. So, the answer is 25.3.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first event from the date of the second event.  Date of the first event: ទីឡើង (January 10, 2023)  Date of the second event: ថ្ងៃទឹកណាពិភ��adin (February 28, 2023)  Subtracting the two dates gives us:  Time difference = February 28, 2023 - January 10, 2023 = 18 days  Therefore, there are 18 days between the two events.
Response:  We know that there are 38 people in total (including the person who asked the question).  Of those, 24 have not yet received their vaccination cards (so they don't have them). Therefore, the number of people who do have their vaccination cards is: $38 - 24 = 14$ So, out of the total number of people, $14/38 \times 100\% = 36.89\%$ have their vaccination cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 students in total (including the student who got 40 marks).  Then, we need to find out how many students scored above 39 marks. So, we can subtract the number of students who scored below 39 marks from the total number of students. In this case, there are 25 students who scored below 39 marks (since 25 x $1 = 25), so we have: Number of students who scored above 39 marks = Total number of students - Number of students who scored below 39 marks = 40 - 25 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 students who scored above 39 marks.
Response:  If we have $100 to invest in stock A and B, then the total value of our portfolio is: Stock A: $50 x 2 = $100 Stock B: $50 x 3 = $150 Total Value: $100 + $150 = $250 Now, if we want to buy more shares of stock A, we need to have at least $50 more to buy an additional share. So, the new total value of our portfolio would be: Total Value: $250 + ($50 / 2) = $275 Therefore, after buying one more share of stock A, the total value of our portfolio increased by $25.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in total between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the starting date from the ending date:  Date 1: January 10, 2023 - Date 2: March 15, 2023 = 73 days (rounded) Therefore, the answer is 73 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of years that Adam lived. According to the Bible, Adam lived for 930 years (Genesis 5:5). Therefore, the total number of years that Adam lived is:  930 + 800 = 1730 years.  Next, we need to calculate the average age at which Adam had his children. According to the question, Adam had Seth when he was 130 years old (Genesis 5:3). Therefore, the average age at which Adam had his children is:  130 / 3 = 43.3 years.  Finally, we need to calculate the total number of generations from Adam to Noah. According to the Bible, it took 1656 years from the birth of Adam to the flood (Genesis 7:6-10). Therefore, the total number of generations from Adam to Noah is:  1656 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of balls in the box. There are 104 balls inside the box. Next, we need to find out how many balls are in each bag. There are 32 bags, and each bag contains 3 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls in each bag is 3 x 32 = 96 balls. Finally, we add the total number of balls in each bag to get the total number of balls that are not in any bag, which is 96 + 104 = 200 balls. So, there are 200 balls that are not in any bag.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in total between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the starting date from the ending date:

Ending Date - Starting Date = 2022-04-07 - 2022-01-01 = 169 days

Now, let's calculate the number of working days between these two dates:

Total Working Days = Number of days - Non-working Days
= 169 days - 18 days (off for New Year)
= 151 days

So, there were 151 working days between January 1st, 2022 and April 7th, 2022."
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in total between the two dates given in the question.  We can do this by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death.  Date of birth is October 14, 1923 and date of death is February 10, 2018. Therefore, the difference between these two dates is 94 years. Now, let's convert it into months by dividing the difference by 12. So, there are 94 months between the two dates. Finally, we need to add 1 to get the total number of months that the person was alive for. Therefore, the answer is 95 months.
Response:  We know that there are 10 kings ( Cambodian monarchs) in total. Each king had at least one queen, so we can assume that each queen has at least one child. Therefore, the number of children born to queens is not less than 10 x 1 = 10. However, some queens may have more than one child, but let's assume an average of 2 children per queen for simplicity. So, the estimated number of offspring of all queens is 10 x 2 = 20. Now, we need to calculate the number of descendants of those offspring. Let's assume that each descendant has an average of 2 children, which is a reasonable estimate considering the size of many royal families. Therefore, the number of descendants of the original 20 offspring is 20 x 2 = 40. Finally, we add the initial 10 kings and their 10 wives to get the total number of people involved in the scenario, which is 10 + 10 = 20. So, the answer is 20.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth (January 1, 1970) from the current date (February 28, 2023).  So, the number of days between these two dates is: 4502 - 1 = 4501 days.  Therefore, the age of Steven as of today is 4501 days.
Response:  We know that there are 3840 days in 10 years (from age 20 to age 30). So, if Steven is currently 30 years old, he has been alive for 3840 / 3 = 1280 years. Therefore, the number of hairs on his head is 4950 x 1280 = 617,600.
Response:  We know that there are 896 balls in total and Steven has taken 312 balls. So, the number of balls left with Steven is 896 - 312 = 584 balls. Now, we need to find out how many groups of 4 balls each Steven can make using these remaining balls. To do this, we divide the total number of balls (584) by 4, which gives us 146 groups of 4 balls each. Therefore, the final answer is 146 groups of 4 balls each.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet.  Each letter can be either uppercase or lowercase. So, we have a total of 52 letters (26 uppercase + 26 lowercase). Now, let's count how many pairs of letters are there in the given text:  There are 10 pairs of letters in the text: ""មានសិស្សចំនួន ២៧០នាក់នៅក្នុងសាលា។""  Therefore, the number of unique letters in the text is: 52 - 10 = 42."
Response:  We know that there are 304 people in total and 75 of them have children. So, we need to find out how many children each person has. To do this, we divide the number of children (75) by the total number of people (304). Therefore, the average number of children per person is:  $ \frac{75}{304} = 0.25$ children per person.
