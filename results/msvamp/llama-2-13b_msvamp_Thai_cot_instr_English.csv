Response:  Firstly, Joo-Leia played with 4 children in the morning and 10 children in the afternoon, so she played with a total of 4 + 10 = 14 children in one day.   Therefore, if Joo-Leia played with all 16 children, she would have played with 14 children twice, which is equal to 2 x 14 = 28 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 people in total, including Jiran and her friends. Secondly, we know that Jiran played with 12 of them on Sunday. Therefore, to find out how many people Jiran played with on Sunday, we can subtract the number of people she did not play with (4) from the total number of people (16). So, the answer is:  16 - 4 = 12.  Thus, Jiran played with 12 people on Sunday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 children in total playing the game on both days (Wednesday and Sunday). On Wednesday, there were 8 children playing the game with her, so we can deduce that she played with 6 children on Wednesday (14 - 8 = 6). Therefore, on Sunday, she played with 8 children (6 + 8 = 14), since all 14 children were present to play the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 people playing the game on Sunday. Next, we know that 15 people played on Monday and 2 people played on Friday.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Joo-Leia played with 9 children in Sunday. Next, she played with 7 children in Monday and 96 children in Wednesday. So, to find out how many more people Joo-Leia played with in Sunday compared to Monday, we need to subtract 7 from 9.  9 - 7 = 2 Therefore, Joo-Leia played with 2 more children in Sunday than in Monday. Now, let's calculate how many more people Joo-Leia played with in Sunday compared to Wednesday. We can do this by subtracting 96 from 9.  9 - 96 = -87 Negative number is not possible, so there is no difference in the number of people Joo-Leia played with in Sunday and Wednesday. In conclusion, Joo-Leia played with the same number of children (9) in all three days.
Response:  We know that Joo-Lee played with 2 children on Sunday and 8 children on Monday. So, in total, she played with 2 + 8 = 10 children during the weekend (Sunday and Monday).   However, we are asked how many more children Joo-Lee played with on Saturday compared to Monday. To find out, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Saturday.  So, let's do that: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, Joo-Lee played with 2 more children on Saturday than she did on Monday.
Response:  We know that there are 8 children playing on Sunday, 11 children playing on Monday, and 9 children playing on Tuesday. To find out how many more children played on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children playing on Tuesday from the number of children playing on Monday. So, let's do that:  11 - 9 = 2 More children played on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 children playing in the park on Sunday. Next, we know that there are 18 children playing in the park on Monday. Finally, we know that there are 7 children playing in the park on Thursday. To find out how many children play in the park overall, we need to add up the number of children playing on each day. So, let's do that:  15 + 18 + 7 = 30  Therefore, there are 30 children playing in the park altogether.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 children playing on Sunday and 10 children playing on Monday. So, in total, there are 13 + 10 = 23 children playing either on Sunday or Monday. Next, we know that there are 15 children playing on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of children playing during the week is 23 + 15 = 38 children.

Next, we know that she played with 7 children on Sunday and 13 children on Monday. Therefore, the total number of children she played with is 7 + 13 = 20 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 12 children playing the game on Monday and 14 children playing the game on Wednesday. Next, we know that she spent 34 hours in total playing both games. Now, let's calculate how many hours she spent playing each game separately. Since there were 12 children playing the game on Monday, she must have spent 12/2 = 6 hours playing the game with them. Similarly, since there were 14 children playing the game on Wednesday, she must have spent 14/2 = 7 hours playing the game with them. Therefore, the total number of children she played the game with is 6 + 7 = 13 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 19 children playing with Jui in total on Sunday. Secondly, we know that she played with 18 children on Monday. Therefore, the total number of children who played with Jui over both days is 19 + 18 = 37 children.
Response:  In one day (24 hours), there are 1440 minutes. If we divide 1440 minutes into groups of 5 people, we get:  1440 / 5 = 288 groups of 5 people. Now, let's calculate how many groups of 6 people can be formed in one day:  1440 / 6 = 240 groups of 6 people. Therefore, there are more groups of 6 people than groups of 5 people in one day. Specifically, there are 240 groups of 6 people and 288 groups of 5 people.
Response:  Firstly, she played with 4 children in Sunday and another 4 children in Monday, so far we have:  4 + 4 = 8 children.  Next, she played with one child in Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, so we add 1 to 8:  8 + 1 = 9 children.  Therefore, there were 9 children that she played with in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 4 children playing with Thai in the afternoon (Wednesday). Next, we know that Thai played with 6 children on Monday and 17 children on Sunday. So, to find out how many more children Thai played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday.  6 - 4 = 2 Therefore, Thai played with 2 more children on Monday than on Wednesday. Now, let's calculate how many more children Thai played with on Sunday than on Wednesday. We can do this by subtracting the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Sunday.  17 - 4 = 13 Therefore, Thai played with 13 more children on Sunday than on Wednesday.

Response:  First, we know that Boobi ate 28 chicken pieces and then added another 42 chicken pieces to her previous amount, so she ate in total:  28 + 42 = 70 chicken pieces.  Next, we are told that she also ate 63 chicken pieces of chocky go, which is equivalent to eating an additional 63/10 = 6.3 times the original amount of chicken pieces she ate (since each piece of chokey go contains 10 chicken pieces). Therefore, Boobi ate a total of:  70 x 6.3 = 431 chicken pieces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Boobi has eaten 33 chicken pieces and 4 more pieces of chicken. So, in total, she has eaten 37 chicken pieces. Next, we need to calculate how many pieces of chicken are left for her to eat. To do this, we subtract the number of pieces she has eaten from the total number of pieces available. In this case, there are 14 pieces of chicken left after Boobi has finished eating all the chicken. Therefore, the answer is:  14 - 37 = -23 (negative because Boobi has eaten too much chicken and there are not enough pieces left for her).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Boobi eats 38 chicken pieces and then she eats another 36 chicken pieces, so in total, she has eaten 38 + 36 = 74 chicken pieces. Next, we are asked how many more chicken pieces Boobi has to eat compared to Chocky. To find out, we need to calculate how many chicken pieces Chocky has eaten. We know that Chocky has eaten 16 chicken pieces, so we can say that Boobi has eaten 74 - 16 = 58 more chicken pieces than Chocky. Therefore, the answer is 58.
Response:  First, we know that the mother bird has eaten 34 chicks in total. Next, we are told that she has eaten 18 more chicks after that. So, if we add 18 to 34, we get:  34 + 18 = 52 Now, we need to find out how many chicks the mother bird has left to eat. To do this, we subtract the number of chicks she has already eaten (52) from the total number of chicks she had (20):  20 - 52 = -32 The negative sign indicates that the mother bird has no chicks left to eat!
Response:  First, we know that Boobi has eaten 5 chicken pieces already. So, she has 21 - 5 = 16 chicken pieces left to eat. Now, she has eaten another 9 chicken pieces, so she has 16 - 9 = 7 chicken pieces left. Therefore, Boobi has eaten a total of 5 + 9 = 14 chicken pieces.
Response:  If Boobi has eaten 22 kids and then eats 5 more, how many kids have been eaten in total? Total number of kids eaten = 22 + 5 = 27 kids.
"Response:  If Boobi has eaten 2 chilies and there are 19 chilies in total, then she has not eaten all of them yet. So, if we subtract the number of chilies she has eaten from the total number of chilies, we can find out how many chilies she has left to eat.  2 (chilies eaten) + x (chilies left to eat) = 19 (total chilies)  We know that Boobi has eaten 2 chilies, so we can substitute 2 for ""x"" in the equation above.  2 + x = 19  Now solve for x.  19 - 2 = 17  Therefore, Boobi has 17 chilies left to eat."
"Response:  If Boobi has eaten 20 pieces of candy, and each piece is 32 chin (a unit of measurement), then she has eaten a total of:  

20 x 32 = 640 chin 

So, if Boobi has eaten 20 pieces of candy, she has eaten 640 chin of candy in total."
Response:  First, we know that she has 17 children and then she had 15 more children. So, in total, she has 17 + 15 = 32 children.   Next, if she starts with 36 children, she will have 36 - 32 = 4 fewer children than before. Therefore, she will have 36 - 4 = 32 children left after giving birth to 36 children.
Response:  If Boobi has 23 pieces of candy and starts eating them one by one, she will have 30 pieces left after finishing all of them. So, if Boobi has 30 pieces of candy, how many pieces does she have in total (including the ones she already ate)? Solution: To find out how many pieces Boobi has in total, we need to add the number of pieces she started with (23) to the number of pieces she finished eating (30). Therefore, the total number of pieces Boobi has is: Total = 23 + 30 = 53 pieces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 5 children and each child has 3 pets. So, in total, Alan has 5 x 3 = 15 pets. However, only 3 of those pets are in the backyard. Therefore, the number of pets Alan has in the backyard is 3.

Response:  If Alan has 5 apples and gives 2 to each of his friends, how many apples will he have left?  1. Alan has 5 apples. 2. He gives 2 apples to each of his 3 friends. 3. So, Alan gives a total of 2 x 3 = 6 apples away. 4. Now, Alan has 5 - 6 = 0 apples left. Therefore, Alan will have no apples left after giving them away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 3 children and each child has 5 toys in their room. So, the total number of toys in Alan's house is 3 x 5 = 15 toys. Next, we are told that Alan buys 2 more toys from the store. Therefore, the new total number of toys in Alan's house is 15 + 2 = 17 toys. Finally, we are asked how many toys are there in total in Alan's house, including those in his children's rooms and the ones he bought from the store. To calculate this, we need to add the number of toys in each room (3 x 5 = 15) to the number of toys Alan bought (2). So, the final answer is: Total number of toys in Alan's house = 15 + 2 = 17 toys.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 2 dogs and 4 cats at home.  Secondly, he bought 3 more dogs from the market, so now he has 2 + 3 = 5 dogs in total.  Finally, we need to find out how many more pets he has than his neighbor. To do this, we compare the number of pets he has with the number of pets his neighbor has, which is mentioned as ""3 dogs and 4 cats"" in the question. So, Alan has 5 dogs and 4 cats, while his neighbor has 3 dogs and 4 cats. Therefore, Alan has more pets than his neighbor by 2 dogs (5 - 3) and 1 cat (4 - 3). In summary, Alan has 2 more dogs and 1 more cat than his neighbor."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 2 children and each child has 6 dolls. So, in total, Alan has  2 x 6 = 12 dolls at home.  Now, if he buys 3 more dolls from the market, he will have  12 + 3 = 15 dolls at home.  Therefore, the number of dolls owned by Alan after buying 3 more dolls is 15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 5 children and he bought 3 more children from the orphanage. So, the total number of children Alan has now is:  5 + 3 = 8 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Auntie Lan has 6 children and she bought 2 more children from the orphanage. So, in total, Auntie Lan has 8 children now (6 + 2).   Next, we are told that Auntie Lan took 3 of her children to the park. Therefore, the number of children Auntie Lan has left at home is 8 - 3 = 5.  Finally, we need to find out how many children Auntie Lan has more than Uncle Joe who only has 2 children. To do this, we subtract the number of children Uncle Joe has from the number of children Auntie Lan has: 5 - 2 = 3.  So, Auntie Lan has 3 more children than Uncle Joe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 6 ducks and he wants to sell them in the market. So, if he sells all of his ducks, he will have no ducks left. Therefore, the number of ducks he can sell is equal to the number of ducks he currently has, which is 6.   Next, we are told that he buys back 3 ducks from the market. This means that after buying back the ducks, he will have 6 - 3 = 3 ducks left. Finally, we are asked how many more ducks Alan will have than before he sold any ducks. To find this out, we need to compare the number of ducks he had initially (6) with the number of ducks he has now (3). The difference between these two numbers is 6 - 3 = 3, so Alan will have 3 more ducks than he had before he sold any ducks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 children playing in the park and each child has 3 balls. So, the total number of balls is 5 x 3 = 15 balls.  Next, we know that 6 more children come to play in the park and each child brings 3 more balls. Therefore, the additional number of balls brought by the new children is 6 x 3 = 18 balls.  In total, there will be 15 + 18 = 33 balls in the park after all the children have arrived.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 children and 20 ducks in the park.  Next, we know that 5 children and 59 ducks come to the park.  So, if we subtract the original number of children from the total number of children who came to the park, we get:  3 (original) - 5 = 2 (remaining)  And if we subtract the original number of ducks from the total number of ducks who came to the park, we get:  20 (original) - 59 = -39 (remaining)  Therefore, there are 2 remaining children and -39 remaining ducks in the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 ducks in total, and 3 of them are swimming in the pond (water). Therefore, the number of ducks not swimming in the pond is 7 - 3 = 4.  Next, we know that 4 ducks are playing in the meadow (grass), so there are no ducks left to play in the sandbox (soil). Hence, the number of ducks playing in the sandbox is 0.  Finally, we can see that there are 5 ducklings playing in the sandbox, which means that all 5 ducklings are playing together!
Response:  If Alan has 5 children and each child has 2 puppies, then Alan has a total of 5 x 2 = 10 puppies.  However, if we subtract the 6 puppies that are in the backyard, Alan is left with 10 - 6 = 4 puppies.  Therefore, Alan has 4 puppies in his house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 2 kids and buys 3 more kids from the market. So, the total number of kids he has is:  2 + 3 = 5 kids.  Next, we are asked how many more kids Alan will have if he takes the 6 kids to the park. To find out, we need to subtract the original number of kids (5) from the total number of kids he has (6):  6 - 5 = 1 kid.  Therefore, if Alan takes the 6 kids to the park, he will have one more kid than he originally had.
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours spent learning English and Chinese, we need to know how many hours are spent on each subject per week.  1. English: 6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours/month 2. Chinese: 2 hours/week x 4 weeks = 8 hours/month 3. Total hours for both subjects: 24 + 8 = 32 hours/month So, the student spends 32 hours per month learning both English and Chinese.

Response:  If they study English for 6 hours and Chinese for 7 hours per week, how many hours will they spend studying both languages combined?  6 + 7 = 13 hours/week.
Response:  If they study English for 6 hours and Chinese for 5 hours per week, how many hours will they spend studying both languages combined in total if they study for 2 days?   To find out, we need to add up the number of hours they spend studying each language.  So, let's do that!  English: 6 hours x 2 days = 12 hours Chinese: 5 hours x 2 days = 10 hours Total: 12 + 10 = 22 hours Therefore, they will spend 22 hours studying both languages combined over the course of 2 days.
Response:  If they spend 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, how many days will it take for them to learn both languages if they study for 6 weeks (assuming a total of 30 days)?  1. First, let's calculate the number of days needed to learn English: 5 hours/day x 30 days = 150 hours 2. Next, let's calculate the number of days needed to learn Chinese: 4 hours/day x 30 days = 120 hours 3. Now, add up the total number of days needed to learn both languages: 150 + 120 = 270 days So, it would take them approximately 270 days (or about 9 months) to learn both English and Chinese if they study for 6 weeks with a daily schedule of 5 hours for English and 4 hours for Chinese.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 86 days in total for both English and Chinese classes. Next, we need to divide this number into two parts - one part for English classes (4 hours per day x 21 days = 84 hours) and another part for Chinese classes (6 hours per day x 35 days = 210 hours). Therefore, the total time spent learning English is 84 hours, while the total time spent learning Chinese is 210 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of hours spent learning English is 6 hours per week, which is equal to 24 hours per month (6 x 4 = 24). Secondly, we know that the total number of hours spent learning Chinese is 7 hours per week, which is also equal to 28 hours per month (7 x 4 = 28). Lastly, we know that the total number of hours spent learning Spanish is 3 hours per week, which is equal to 12 hours per month (3 x 4 = 12). Therefore, the total number of hours spent learning all three languages combined is: 24 + 28 + 12 = 64 hours per month.
Response:  To calculate how many hours are spent learning English compared to Chinese and Spanish, we need to convert all the time periods into hours.  1 hour = 60 minutes 1 minute = 60 seconds So, let's start!  First, we have 6 hours of English classes per week: 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/week  Next, we have 3 hours of Chinese classes per week: 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes/week Finally, we have 58 hours of Spanish classes per year: 58 hours / 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes/year Now, let's compare the total number of minutes spent learning each language: Total minutes for English: 360 minutes/week + 960 minutes/year = 1,320 minutes/year Total minutes for Chinese: 180 minutes/week + 960 minutes/year = 1,140 minutes/year Total minutes for Spanish: 960 minutes/year Therefore, the student spends more time learning English (1,320 minutes) than Chinese (1,140 minutes), but less time learning Spanish (960 minutes) than Chinese (1,140 minutes).
Response:  To calculate how many hours are spent learning English compared to Spanish and Chinese, we need to know the total number of hours spent studying each language.  Here is the information given in the question:  7 hours per week for English (7 x 4 = 28 hours/month) 2 hours per week for Chinese (2 x 4 = 8 hours/month) 4 hours per week for Spanish (4 x 4 = 16 hours/month) Total hours per month: English - 28 hours Chinese - 8 hours Spanish - 16 hours Now let's convert these numbers to hours per year:  English - 28 hours/month x 12 months = 336 hours/year Chinese - 8 hours/month x 12 months = 96 hours/year Spanish - 16 hours/month x 12 months = 192 hours/year So, based on this calculation, the student spends more time learning English (336 hours/year) than Chinese (96 hours/year) or Spanish (192 hours/year).
Response:  We know that we spend 2 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many hours we spend studying Chinese in total, we can multiply the number of days we study Chinese (5 days) by the number of hours we spend studying Chinese per day (5 hours). So, we spend 5 x 5 = 25 hours studying Chinese. Now, let's compare this to the number of hours we spend studying Spanish. We spend 4 hours studying Spanish per day for 4 days, so we spend a total of 4 x 4 = 16 hours studying Spanish. Therefore, we spend more time studying Chinese than studying Spanish.
"Response:  If they spend 2 hours per day learning English and 1 hour per day learning Chinese, how many hours will they spend in total each week?  

First, let's calculate the time spent learning English:  

2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week (learning English)  Next, let's calculate the time spent learning Chinese:  

1 hour/day x 7 days/week = 7 hours/week (learning Chinese)  Now, add up the total number of hours spent learning both languages:  

14 hours/week + 7 hours/week = 21 hours/week (total)"
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours spent learning English and Chinese per week, we need to know how many hours are spent on each language per day.  1. How many hours do you spend learning English per day? 2. How many hours do you spend learning Chinese per day? 3. What is the total number of hours spent learning both languages per day? 4. What is the total number of hours spent learning both languages per week?  Now let's apply these questions to your situation. You mentioned that you spend 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. So, to calculate the total number of hours spent learning both languages per day, we can add the time spent on each language: Total hours per day = 4 + 5 = 9 hours per day.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours spent learning both languages per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the total hours per day by 7: Total hours per week = 9 x 7 = 63 hours per week.  Therefore, you spend 63 hours per week learning both English and Chinese.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Thifanny has 8 socks in her drawer on Monday morning.  On Tuesday, she finds 7 more socks in her drawer, which means she now has a total of 8 + 7 = 15 socks.   Therefore, Thifanny has 15 socks in her drawer on Wednesday morning.
Response:  First, we know that there are 7 socks in the first package and 12 socks in the second package. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  7 + 12 = 19  Therefore, there are 19 socks in total.
Response: 1. The first day, she had 4 bags of rice. 2. On the second day, she bought 2 more bags of rice. So, in total, she has 4 + 2 = 6 bags of rice.  3. On the third day, she bought another 2 bags of rice. Therefore, she now has 6 + 2 = 8 bags of rice.
Response:  Firstly, she had 4 bags of rice on Monday.  On Tuesday, she bought another 4 bags of rice, so now she has in total:  4 + 4 = 8 bags of rice.
Response:  First, she had 10 bags of rice. Then, she gave 3 bags to her friend. So, she has 10 - 3 = 7 bags left. Finally, she met another friend and gave 7 more bags away. Therefore, she has 7 - 7 = 0 bags left!
Response:  First, we know that Thifanny has 8 pairs of socks on Monday.  Next day (Tuesday), she loses 2 pairs of socks and has 6 pairs left.  On Wednesday, she gains back 4 pairs of socks, making her total number of socks 10 pairs. Finally, on Thursday, she loses another 2 pairs of socks, leaving her with 8 pairs again. Therefore, the total number of socks Thifanny had throughout the week is:  8 + 6 + 10 - 2 = 22 pairs of socks.
Response:  Firstly, she had 3 bags of rice on Monday.  On Tuesday, she bought 7 more bags of rice, so now she has 3 + 7 = 10 bags of rice in total.  Then, on Wednesday, she bought another 44 bags of rice, so now she has 10 + 44 = 54 bags of rice in total.  Therefore, the total number of bags of rice that Thanit had is 54 bags.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red birds and 16 blue birds in total. To find out how many more red birds than blue birds, we need to subtract the number of blue birds from the total number of birds. Total number of birds = 17 + 16 = 33 Subtracting 16 from 33 gives us: 33 - 16 = 17 So, there are 17 more red birds than blue birds.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red birds and 11 blue birds in total. To find out how many more blue birds than red birds, we can subtract the number of red birds from the total number of birds. Total birds = 5 + 11 = 16 So, there are 16 birds in total. Now, let's subtract the number of red birds from the total number of birds to find out how many more blue birds: 16 - 5 = 11 Therefore, there are 11 more blue birds than red birds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 red birds and 5 blue birds in total.  Secondly, if each red bird lays 2 eggs, then there will be 2 x 10 = 20 eggs laid by red birds. Thirdly, since each blue bird lays 3 eggs, there will be 3 x 5 = 15 eggs laid by blue birds. Lastly, the total number of eggs laid is 20 + 15 = 35 eggs. Therefore, there will be 35 chicks in the nest.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 red birds and 2 blue birds in the tree. So, the total number of birds is 3 + 2 = 5. Next, we know that each bird lays 2 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid per day is 5 x 2 = 10 eggs per day. Finally, since there are 10 days in the period, the total number of eggs collected at the end of the period is 10 x 10 = 100 eggs.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red birds, 15 blue birds, and 8 green birds in total. So we can start by adding up all these numbers to get the total number of birds:  7 + 15 + 8 = 30  Now we need to find out how many birds are in each color group. To do this, we can use subtraction to subtract each color group from the total number of birds:  30 - 7 = 23 (red birds)  30 - 15 = 15 (blue birds)  30 - 8 = 22 (green birds)  Therefore, there are 23 red birds, 15 blue birds, and 22 green birds in the tree.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red flowers, 71 yellow flowers, and 8 blue flowers. To find out how many purple flowers there are, we need to add up all the numbers of flowers in each color category. So, we have: 7 + 71 + 8 = 86 flowers. Therefore, there are 86 purple flowers.
Response:  We know that there are 2 red birds, 6 yellow birds, and 14 blue birds in total. So, if we add up all the numbers of birds, we get:  2 + 6 + 14 = 22 birds. Therefore, there are 22 birds in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 red birds in the tree. Next, we know that there are 11 blue birds and 12 yellow birds in the tree as well. So, if we add up all these numbers together, we get:  19 + 11 + 12 = 42 birds in total. Therefore, there are 42 birds of different colors living in the tree.
Response:  First, we know that there are 6 red flowers, 90 yellow flowers, and 16 blue flowers in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers of each color are in the bouquet. To do this, we can use a pie chart or a bar graph to visualize the distribution of flower colors. Based on the information given, we have: Red flowers: 6/325 = 1/59 Yellow flowers: 90/325 = 1/4 Blue flowers: 16/325 = 1/20 So, there are 1/59 red flowers, 1/4 yellow flowers, and 1/20 blue flowers in the bouquet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 red birds, 14 blue birds, and 17 yellow birds in total. Next, we need to find out how many birds of each color are in the tree. We can start by finding the number of red birds in the tree. Since there are 18 red birds in total, and 3 trees, each tree has 18/3 = 6 red birds. Now, let's move on to the blue birds. There are 14 blue birds in total, and again, each tree has 14/3 = 4 blue birds. Finally, we have the yellow birds. There are 17 yellow birds in total, and each tree has 17/3 = 5 yellow birds. So, the final answer is: Red birds: 6 Blue birds: 4 Yellow birds: 5
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 red birds, 14 blue birds, and 6 green birds in total. Next, we need to find out how many birds of each color are in the tree. We can start by looking at the red birds. There are 5 red birds in total, so there must be 5 red birds in the tree as well. Now let's look at the blue birds. There are 14 blue birds in total, but since we already have 5 red birds, we only have 9 blue birds left to distribute among the remaining spots in the tree. Finally, we have 6 green birds left over, which means there must be 3 green birds in the tree as well (since we cannot divide 6 into two equal groups). Therefore, the number of birds in the tree is: 5 + 9 + 3 = 17 birds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each tray has 7 red cherries and 3 yellow cherries, so the total number of cherries in each tray is:  7 + 3 = 10  Now, since there are 65 trays in total, we can multiply the number of cherries per tray by the number of trays to get the total number of cherries:  10 x 65 = 650  Therefore, there are 650 cherries in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 11 trays of fruit in total. Each tray has either 10 or 18 fruits, so let's count how many fruits there are in total.  11 x 10 = 110 fruits (from the 10-fruit trays) + 11 x 18 = 198 fruits (from the 18-fruit trays) Total number of fruits = 110 + 198 = 308 fruits.  So, there are 308 fruits in total.
Response:  First, we know that each red block has 16 blue blocks inside it. Therefore, if there are 6 red blocks in total, then the number of blue blocks inside all the red blocks is:  6 x 16 = 96 blue blocks. Next, we need to find out how many green blocks there are. We know that each red block has 18 green blocks inside it. So, if there are 6 red blocks in total, then the number of green blocks inside all the red blocks is:  6 x 18 = 108 green blocks. Now, let's add up all the blue and green blocks to get the total number of blocks: 96 + 108 = 204 blocks. Therefore, there are 204 blocks in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 turtles in total and each turtle has either 10 or 2 babies. So, we can start by counting how many turtles have 10 babies.   There are 3 turtles with 10 babies (3 x 10 = 30). Now, let's count how many turtles have 2 babies. There is only one turtle with 2 babies. Therefore, the total number of baby turtles is 30 + 2 = 32.
Response:  Firstly, we have 4 red birds and 3 blue birds in total.  Next, we add 3 more blue birds to make it 6 blue birds in total. Now, let's count the number of birds in each color group: Red Birds: 4 + 0 (no change) = 4 Blue Birds: 3 + 6 = 9 Total Birds: 4 + 9 = 13 So, there will be 13 birds in the combined flock.
Response:  We know that each drawer has 4 red and 2 blue marbles.  So, in total, there are  4 x 3 = 12 red marbles and  2 x 3 = 6 blue marbles.  Therefore, if we have all 12 drawers filled with marbles, we will have  12 x 12 = 144 red marbles and  6 x 12 = 72 blue marbles.  Now, let's calculate how many purple marbles we will have in each drawer.  Since each drawer contains 4 red and 2 blue marbles, we can say that for every 4 red marbles, there is 1 blue marble.  Therefore, for every 12 red marbles (which is the number of red marbles in one drawer), there are  12 / 4 = 3 blue marbles.  So, in each drawer, we will have  3 blue marbles + 4 red marbles = 7 purple marbles.  In other words, if we fill all 12 drawers with marbles, we will have  7 x 12 = 84 purple marbles in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 children in total. Secondly, we know that there are 13 red-haired children and some number of green-haired children (not specified). So, to find out how many green-haired children there are, we need to subtract the number of red-haired children from the total number of children.  16 - 13 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 3 more green-haired children than red-haired children. Therefore, there are 3 x 2 = 6 green-haired children in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each red apple has 19 children and each green apple has 4 children. So, in total, there are 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Now, if we have 15 apples in total, we can calculate how many children each apple has as follows: 15 / 23 = 0.65 (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, each apple has approximately 7 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 children in total and each group of friends has 4 red-haired children and 6 blue-eyed children. So, the total number of red-haired children is 4 x 10 = 40, and the total number of blue-eyed children is 6 x 10 = 60. Therefore, the total number of children in each group of friends is 40 + 60 = 100.
Response:  We know that there are 6 blue birds, 60 yellow birds, and 2 red birds in the tree. To find out how many more blue birds than red birds, we need to compare their numbers.   Blue birds: 6  Red birds: 2 So, there are 4 more blue birds than red birds (6 - 2 = 4). Therefore, the number of blue birds is greater than the number of red birds by 4 birds.
Response:  Firstly, there are four acorns on the table.  Next, each acorn has eight seeds inside. Therefore, in total, there are 4 x 8 = 32 seeds on the table.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy had 3 action figures on his shelf before he added 7 more. So, the total number of action figures on his shelf is:  3 + 7 = 10  Therefore, Jeremy has 10 action figures on his shelf now.
Response:  Firstly, there are 4 books and 22 pages in each book.  Secondly, there are 6 additional books with 10 chapters each. So, we need to calculate how many pages are in total.   Total number of pages = (4 x 22) + (6 x 10) = 88 + 60 = 148 pages.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy has 5 books and 9 notebooks on his shelf.  Then he added 7 more books to the shelf. So, how many books does Jeremy have in total now?   Solution:  To find out how many books Jeremy has in total, we need to add the original number of books (5) to the new number of books (7). Therefore, the total number of books Jeremy has is:  5 + 7 = 12
Response:  Firstly, there are 2 acorns and 10 pages in the pile on the ground.  Next, there are 4 more acorns added to the pile, bringing the total number of acorns to 2 + 4 = 6 acorns.  Now, let's count the number of pages that have been added due to the additional acorns. For each acorn, there will be 1 page added, so we have 6 x 1 = 6 pages added.  Therefore, the total number of pages in the pile now is 10 + 6 = 16 pages.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy has 8 books and 9 notebooks in his bag.  Secondly, he adds 10 more notebooks to his bag, making it a total of 19 items (8 books + 9 notebooks + 10 additional notebooks).   Therefore, the number of notebooks that Jeremy has is 19.
Response:  Firstly, there are 7 books and 2 notebooks on the shelf.  Secondly, there are 4 more notebooks added to the shelf. So, in total, there are 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf.   However, we need to subtract the number of notebooks that were already there (2) from the total number of items (9), which gives us 9 - 2 = 7 items that are new additions to the shelf.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeremy has 5 books and 2 notebooks on his shelf.  Secondly, he added 9 more notebooks to the shelf. So, in total, Jeremy now has 5 + 2 = 7 books and 2 + 9 = 11 notebooks on his shelf.   Therefore, the total number of items Jeremy has is 7 (books) + 11 (notebooks) = 18 items.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy has 8 acorns in his hand.  He puts 4 of them on the ground and then takes out 5 old ones from the pile. So, how many acorns does Jeremy have left?   Solution:  To find out how many acorns Jeremy has left, we need to subtract the number of acorns he took out (5) from the total number of acorns he had (8). Therefore, Jeremy has 8 - 5 = 3 acorns left.
Response:  Firstly, there are three acorns on the first shelf, and four acorns on the second shelf. In total, there are 3 + 4 = 7 acorns on the two shelves. Next, we need to find out how many acorns are left on the third shelf. We know that there are six acorns on the third shelf in total. So, if we subtract the number of acorns on the first two shelves from the total number of acorns on the third shelf, we get:  6 - 7 = -1 acorns left on the third shelf. Therefore, there is one acorn left on the third shelf.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy has 7 acorns in his hand.  He puts them on the table and then he adds 10 more acorns to the table. So, the total number of acorns on the table is 7 + 10 = 17.   Therefore, there are 17 acorns on the table.
Response:  Firstly, there are 7 old action figures on the shelf.  If Jeremy adds 2 more new action figures to the shelf, there will be a total of 9 action figures on the shelf (7 old + 2 new).  Next, if he takes away 3 action figures from the shelf, there will be 6 action figures left (7 old - 3 new = 6).  Finally, if he has 10 action figures in total, and he already has 6 action figures on the shelf, then he must have 4 more action figures that are not on the shelf yet (10 - 6 = 4).   Therefore, the correct answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, Jeremy has 9 acorns in his hand. Then he adds 7 more acorns to his hand from the ground floor. So, the total number of acorns Jeremy has is 9 + 7 = 16. Next, if Jeremy has 10 books on the top shelf, and each book contains 5 pages with acorns, then the total number of acorns on the top shelf is 10 x 5 = 50. Therefore, the total number of acorns that Jeremy has, including those on the top shelf, is 16 + 50 = 66.
Response:  Firstly, there are 3 books and 4 cartoon characters on the shelf in front of him.  Then he adds 2 more cartoon characters to the shelf, so now there are 6 cartoon characters in total (3 + 2 = 6).   Therefore, the number of cartoon characters on each shelf is 6.
Response:  Firstly, there are 7 books on the shelf and 3 action figures on the floor. So, we have a total of 7 + 3 = 10 items in the room. Next, we add 2 more action figures to the shelf, so now we have 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 items in the room. Finally, we increase the number of books by 4, so now we have 7 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 16 items in the room. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  Firstly, we have 2 turtles sitting on the raft.  If another turtle joins them, there will be 3 turtles in total.  Now, if all 3 turtles fall off the raft, there will be no turtles left on the raft.  So, the answer is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we have 4 turtles already in the pond.  If we add another 5 turtles to the pond, how many turtles will be swimming in total?  5 + 4 = 9 turtles will be swimming in the pond.
Response:  Firstly, we have 4 groups of ducks with 13 ducks in each group, so there are 4 x 13 = 52 ducks altogether. Next, we add 6 more ducks to each group, so now we have 4 x 19 = 76 ducks in total. Therefore, the number of ducks standing on the raft is 76.
Response:  Firstly, we have three monkeys and two cats sitting on the rack.  So, there are five animals in total (3 + 2 = 5).  Next, we add five more monkeys to the group, bringing the total number of animals to ten (5 + 5 = 10).   Therefore, there are ten animals altogether - three monkeys, two cats, and five additional monkeys.
Response:  Firstly, we have 3 ducks and 4 geese in total (3 + 4 = 7). Next, we add 2 more ducks to make it 7 + 2 = 9 birds altogether. Finally, we subtract 1 goose from the total number of birds because one goose has flown away, leaving us with 9 - 1 = 8 birds remaining. Therefore, there are 8 birds left on the farm after one goose flew away.
Response:  We know that there are 2 monkeys and 6 birds sitting on the tree branch.   Moreover, we have 3 more monkeys coming to join them. So, in total, how many animals will be sitting on the branch?   To solve this problem, let's use our numbers:  2 (monkeys already there) + 3 (more monkeys joining) = 5 (total number of monkeys)  6 (birds already there) + 5 (monkeys) = 11 (total number of animals on the branch) Therefore, there will be 11 animals on the branch after all the monkeys have joined - 2 monkeys already there and 3 more monkeys joining them.
Response:  Firstly, we have 4 monkeys and 6 giraffes in total.   Secondly, there are 2 more monkeys that join the group, so now we have 4 + 2 = 6 monkeys.  Lastly, we need to subtract the number of giraffes that joined the group (2), leaving us with 6 - 2 = 4 giraffes.  Therefore, there are 6 monkeys and 4 giraffes left standing on the branch.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 monkeys and 4 giraffes in total.  
1. Monkeys: There are 3 monkeys in total. Each monkey has 2 tails, so we have 3 x 2 = 6 tails for the monkeys. 
2. Giraffes: There are 4 giraffes in total. Each giraffe has 4 necks, so we have 4 x 4 = 16 necks for the giraffes. 
Now let's add up all the body parts: 
Monkeys: 6 tails + 3 bodies = 9 body parts (since each monkey has 2 bodies) 
Giraffes: 16 necks + 4 bodies = 20 body parts (since each giraffe has 2 bodies) 
Total number of body parts: 9 + 20 = 29 body parts."
Response:  We know that there are 6 monkeys and 3 giraffes on the tree.  If we add 2 more monkeys to the group, there will be a total of 8 monkeys.  Since there are already 3 giraffes on the tree, adding 2 more monkeys means that there will be a total of 10 animals (8 monkeys + 2 giraffes) on the tree.   Therefore, the correct answer is 10.
Response:  Firstly, we have 4 monkeys and 3 giraffes standing on the ground.  Next, we add 6 more monkeys to the group, bringing the total number of monkeys to 10 (4 + 6). Now, let's count how many giraffes are still standing on the ground. We have 3 giraffes initially, and no giraffes were added or removed from the group. Therefore, there are still 3 giraffes standing on the ground after adding 6 more monkeys. So, the final answer is:  10 monkeys and 3 giraffes.
Response:  We know that there are 6 turtles sitting on the log.   If we add 4 more turtles to the log, then there will be a total of 6 + 4 = 10 turtles sitting on the log.  Now, if we add 8 more turtles to the log, then there will be a total of 10 + 8 = 18 turtles sitting on the log.  So, in total, there are 18 turtles sitting on the log.
Response:  Firstly, we have two birds sitting on a branch (2). Next, there are five more birds flying around (5), and four more birds perched on another branch (4). In total, how many birds do we have?  2 + 5 + 4 = 11 birds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 ducks sitting on the raft.  Next, we know that there are 2 more ducks swimming in the water.  Finally, we know that there are 6 more ducks coming to join the group.  So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  3 + 2 + 6 = 11  Therefore, there will be 11 ducks altogether on the raft and in the water.
Response:  We know that there are 5 monkeys in total, and 3 of them are sitting on the tree branch. This means we have 2 more monkeys somewhere else. Now, let's consider the information that 4 more monkeys will join the group soon. So, if we add 4 to the existing 2, we get a total of 6 monkeys joining the group. Therefore, the final number of monkeys in the group, including those already present and those joining later, is:  5 (existing) + 6 (joining) = 11 monkeys.
Response:  We have 6 chickens and 2 ducks in total.  3 more chickens join us, so now we have 6 + 3 = 9 chickens.  But we still have only 2 ducks, so the total number of birds is 9 (chickens) + 2 (ducks) = 11 birds.
Response:  We know that there are 3 ducks sitting on the raft and 6 more ducks swimming in the water. So, the total number of ducks is 3 + 6 = 9.   Now, we also know that there are 2 more ducks coming to join the group. Therefore, the final total number of ducks will be 9 + 2 = 11.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first essay has 48 pages. Secondly, we know that the second essay has 11 pages less than the first essay. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  48 - 11 = 37 pages. So, the second essay has 37 pages.
"Response:  First, we know that the second chapter has more pages than the first chapter because it is stated in the problem as ""บทที่สองมีหน้ามากกว่าบทแรก"". So, if the first chapter has 37 pages, then the second chapter must have at least 37 + x pages, where x is the number of additional pages needed to make the total number of pages for both chapters equal to 80. Now, let's substitute the value of x into our equation:  37 + x = 80  Simplifying the equation:  43 = 80 - 37  43 = 43   True! The second chapter has 43 pages more than the first chapter."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in both books is 93 pages. Secondly, we are given that the first book has 60 pages. Therefore, to find out how many pages the second book has, we can subtract the number of pages in the first book from the total number of pages: Total number of pages - Number of pages in the first book = Number of pages in the second book 93 - 60 = 33 pages The second book has 33 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in both books is 67 pages. Secondly, we are given that Book 1 has 36 pages. Therefore, to find out how many pages Book 2 must have, we can subtract the number of pages in Book 1 from the total number of pages:  67 - 36 = 31 pages. So, Book 2 must have 31 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the book has three parts with the following page counts: Part 1 - 66 pages, Part 2 - 35 pages, and Part 3 - 24 pages. Next, let's calculate the total number of pages in the entire book: Total pages = Part 1 + Part 2 + Part 3 Total pages = 66 + 35 + 24 Total pages = 125 pages Therefore, the book has 125 pages in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 91 pages. Secondly, the second chapter has 23 pages. Finally, the third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many pages in total, we need to add up all these page numbers. Therefore, the total number of pages is: 91 + 23 + 25 = 140 pages.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the first book has 35 pages. Secondly, the second book has more than 18 pages (since it is stated as ""more than""). Finally, the third book has only 3 pages. So, if we compare the number of pages among the three books, we can see that: Book 1 > Book 2 > Book 3 Therefore, the correct order from most to least pages is: 1st Book (35 pages) > 2nd Book (more than 18 pages) > 3rd Book (3 pages)"
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 53 pages. Secondly, the second chapter has 75 pages. Finally, the third chapter has 21 pages. To find out how many pages in total, we need to add up all these page numbers. So, the total number of pages is: 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pages. Therefore, the book has 149 pages in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 chapters in total. Secondly, each chapter has 61 pages on average. So to find out how many pages in total, we need to multiply the number of chapters by the number of pages per chapter. Therefore, the total number of pages is:  31 x 61 = 1861 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first essay has 10 pages. Secondly, we know that the second essay has 23 pages in total. Therefore, to find out how many pages are in the first essay, we can subtract 23 from 100 (the total number of pages) and divide by 2 (since there are two essays). So, the calculation is as follows:  100 - 23 = 77 77 / 2 = 38.5 Therefore, the first essay has approximately 38.5 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in both books is 81 + 68 = 159 pages. Next, we need to find out how many pages are in book two (the one with 68 pages). To do this, we can divide the total number of pages in both books by the number of pages in book two:  159 pages / 68 pages per book = 2.32 books. Therefore, there are approximately 2.32 books worth of pages in book two.
Response:  We know that there are 62 students in total and they are divided into two groups of 39 and 23 students. To find out how many more students are in the morning group than in the afternoon group, we need to subtract the number of students in the afternoon group from the total number of students. Total number of students = 62 Subtracting the number of students in the afternoon group (23) from the total number of students gives us the difference between the two groups: 62 - 23 = 39 So, there are 39 more students in the morning group than in the afternoon group.
Response:  We know that there are 52 students in the morning shift and 61 students in the afternoon shift. To find out how many more students are in the afternoon shift than in the morning shift, we need to subtract the number of students in the morning shift from the number of students in the afternoon shift.  52 - 61 = -9 So, there are 9 fewer students in the afternoon shift than in the morning shift.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 32 students in total. Secondly, we know that some of them went to the morning shift and some went to the afternoon shift. So, if we subtract the number of students who went to the morning shift from the total number of students, we will get the number of students who went to the afternoon shift.  To find out how many students went to the morning shift, let's divide the total number of students by 2 (since there are two shifts).  32 / 2 = 16  Therefore, 16 students went to the morning shift, and the remaining 32 - 16 = 16 students went to the afternoon shift.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 people who go to the beach in the morning and 60 people in total. So, if we divide 60 by 7, we get:  60 / 7 = 8 Therefore, there will be 8 groups of people going to the beach in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that there are 36 students in the morning session, and 49 students in the afternoon session, for a total of 85 students.   Therefore, the number of students who participated in all three sessions is 85.
"Response:  We know that there are 44 students in total.  

Step 1: Find out how many students went to the morning shift.  We know that 39 students went to the morning shift. So, we can subtract 39 from 44 to find out how many students did not go to the morning shift.  

44 - 39 =?  Answer:  6 

So, there were 6 students who did not go to the morning shift.  

Step 2: Find out how many students went to the afternoon shift.  We know that 31 students went to the afternoon shift. So, we can subtract 31 from 6 (the number of students who did not go to the morning shift) to find out how many students did not go to the afternoon shift.  

6 - 31 =?  Answer:  5 

So, there were 5 students who did not go to the afternoon shift.  

Therefore, the number of students who went to the morning and afternoon shifts combined is:  

39 + 31 = 70 

Answer:  70"
"Response:  We know that there are 53 students in the morning shift, and each shift has 48 students, so we can start by comparing 53 to 48.  53 is greater than 48, so we know that there are more students in the morning shift than in either of the other two shifts.  Now let's compare 53 to 49, the number of students in the afternoon shift.  Again, we can see that 53 is greater than 49, so we know that there are more students in the morning shift than in the afternoon shift as well.  Finally, let's compare 53 to 49 + 48 = 97, the total number of students in both the afternoon and evening shifts combined.  Once again, we can see that 53 is greater than 97, so we know that there are more students in the morning shift than in all three other shifts combined.  Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many more students are in the morning shift than in the other three shifts combined?"" is 53 - (49 + 48) = 53 - 97 = 44."
Response:  We know that there are 33 students who go to school in the morning and 34 students who go to school in the afternoon. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  33 + 34 = 67  Now, we need to find out how many of those students go to school in both the morning and afternoon sessions. To do this, we can use subtraction. We know that 10 students go to school in the evening session, so if we subtract 10 from our total number of students (67), we get:  67 - 10 = 57  Therefore, there are 57 students who go to school in both the morning and afternoon sessions.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 people who went to the sea and returned in the morning.  Secondly, we know that there were 59 people who went to the forest and returned in the afternoon.  Finally, we know that there were 21 people who went to the beach and returned in the evening.  To find out how many people went to all three places, we need to add up the number of people who went to each place.  13 + 59 + 21 =?  The answer is 93 people.
Response:  We know that there are 29 students in the morning shift and 66 students in the afternoon shift. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  29 + 66 = 95  Therefore, there are 95 students in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 students in total. Of those, 4 students went on the morning trip and 26 students went on the afternoon trip. Therefore, the number of students who went on both trips is:  4 + 26 = 30 students.
Response:  We know that there are 46 students in total. Of those, 43 students went on the morning trip and some students went on the afternoon trip. So, we can start by finding out how many students went on the afternoon trip. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who went on the morning trip from the total number of students.  46 - 43 =?  Now we have found out that 3 students went on the afternoon trip. Finally, we want to know how many students went on the afternoon trip. 3.
Response:  If the tree has 7 apples at the beginning and each apple is picked by one of the children, then there will be no apples left on the tree. So, the number of apples that the children can pick from the tree is 0.   Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  There are 4 children in total.  2 of them have already eaten their apples and thrown away the cores. So, there are only 2 apples left to be divided among the remaining 2 children. Each child will receive 1 apple, so the answer is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 children in total and each child has eaten either 3 or 5 apples. So, if we let X be the number of children who have eaten 3 apples, then Y = 7 - X represents the number of children who have eaten 5 apples. Now, we need to find out how many children have not eaten any apples. To do this, we can subtract the sum of X and Y from 7, like this:  7 - (X + Y) =?  Can you fill in the missing value(s)?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 suckers on the mother plant and each sucker has 3 leaves. Therefore, the total number of leaves is 2 x 3 = 6 leaves. Next, we need to find out how many suckers will be produced from the mother plant in total. We can see that there are already 7 suckers on the mother plant, so we just need to add 1 more sucker for each of the 2 existing suckers to get the total number of suckers produced. Thus, the total number of suckers produced is 2 + (2 x 1) = 2 + 2 = 4 suckers. Finally, we need to count the number of leaves on these new suckers. Each sucker has 3 leaves, so the total number of leaves is 4 x 3 = 12 leaves.
"Response:  If the tree has 6 fruits and each fruit has 2 seeds, then there are 6 x 2 = 12 seeds in total.  
If the tree produces 2 new apples every year and each apple has 2 seeds, then there will be 2 x 2 = 4 new seeds produced every year.  Therefore, after 6 years, there will be 4 x 6 = 24 new seeds produced in total.  So, the tree will have 12 + 24 = 36 seeds in total after 6 years."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 babies born from the same mother.   Secondly, each baby has 2 hands and 10 fingers (not including thumbs). Therefore, in total, there will be 60 fingers (3 x 2 x 10 = 60). Lastly, since there are 27 babies in total, we can conclude that each baby has 27/60 of the total number of fingers, which is equal to 4.5 fingers per baby (27/60 = 4.5). So, the first baby has 4.5 fingers, the second baby has 4.5 fingers, and the third baby also has 4.5 fingers.
Response:  Firstly, there were 7 apples in the basket.  After that, 2 new apples grew from the tree, so now there are 7 + 2 = 9 apples in total. However, 6 of those apples are rotten, leaving only 3 healthy apples. Therefore, the number of healthy apples is 3.
Response:  Firstly, there were 3 kids who had an apple each.  Then, 2 of them gave their apples to their mother, so now there are 3 - 2 = 1 kid with an apple left.   Finally, this last child also gives his/her apple to the mother, leaving her with a total of 3 apples.  So, the number of apples on the tree is 3.
Response:  Firstly, there are 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards. Secondly, each card has four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). Therefore, we can deduce that there are 4 x 52 = 208 cards with each suit. Now, let's focus on the question. We know that Emily took two cards from the top of the deck. So, if we subtract two cards from 208, we get: 208 - 2 = 206 cards remaining in the deck. Finally, we need to find out how many hearts Emily has left after taking two cards. To do this, we divide the number of hearts she had initially (which is half of the total number of cards) by the number of cards remaining in the deck: (26/206) x 100% = 12.5%. Therefore, Emily has 12.5% of hearts left after taking two cards from the top of the deck.
Response:  There are 3 tanks of apples in total. Each tank has 8 apples. So, there are 3 x 8 = 24 apples in total. Now, let's see how many children can get apples from each tank. Since each child can only take one apple, we need to divide the number of apples in each tank by the number of children who can take apples from that tank. We have: Tank 1: 8 apples / 3 children = 2 apples per child Tank 2: 8 apples / 3 children = 2 apples per child Tank 3: 8 apples / 3 children = 2 apples per child Therefore, in total, there are 2 x 3 = 6 apples available for each child. So, there are 6 x 9 = 54 apples available for all the children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 tigers in total and each tiger has 7 cubs. Therefore, the number of cubs is 4 x 7 = 28. However, some of these cubs may have already left their mothers to start their own families, so we need to subtract those who have left from the total number of cubs. We can assume that about half of the cubs (14) have already left, leaving us with 28 - 14 = 14 cubs still living with their mothers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 kids in total. Secondly, we know that 2 kids have been chosen to play in the game. Therefore, if we subtract 2 from 19, we get 17. So, there are 17 kids left who have not been chosen to play in the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 children in the first group and each child has 45 balls. So, the total number of balls is 10 x 45 = 450 balls.  Next, we know that there are 11 children in the second group and each child has 36 balls. So, the total number of balls is 11 x 36 = 396 balls.  Finally, we need to find out how many more balls are needed for both groups combined. To do this, we subtract the total number of balls from the second group from the total number of balls from the first group:  450 - 396 = 54 more balls are needed.  Therefore, the answer is 54 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has 6 children and each child has played soccer for 7 years. So, in total, Ed has 6 x 7 = 42 years of experience playing soccer. However, if he had 22 children instead of 6, then he would have 22 x 7 = 154 years of experience playing soccer!
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 kids in total and 5 of them are playing hide-and-seek. So, the number of kids not playing is 27 - 5 = 22. Now, if each group has 3 kids, then the number of groups is 22 / 3 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 groups of kids playing hide-and-seek.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 ducks in total.  Secondly, we know that 9 ducks were added to the pond, bringing the total number of ducks to 33.  Therefore, the number of ducks that the farmer has is 33.   So, the answer is 33.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has 29 kids and 17 of them are playing outside. So, how many kids does Ed have left inside the house? To find out, we can subtract 17 from 29:  29 - 17 =?  Yes, that's right! Ed has 12 kids left inside the house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 kids in total. Secondly, we know that 8 of them are from Ed's group. Therefore, to find out how many kids are left for the other groups, we can subtract 8 from 19. So, 19 - 8 = 11. This means that there are 11 kids left for the other groups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has 30 children in total. Secondly, he has 21 children playing soccer. Therefore, to find out how many more children Ed has who are not playing soccer, we can subtract 21 from 30:  30 - 21 = 9 So, Ed has 9 more children who are not playing soccer.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has 17 kids and each kid can play for 20 minutes. So, in total, how many minutes of playing time do all his kids have?  17 x 20 = 340 minutes Now, let's subtract the number of minutes played by each child to find out how many minutes are left for the last child to play. 340 - (12 x 20) = 340 - 240 = 100 minutes The last child will play for 100 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 408 students in total. Of those, 42 students recommended adding more beef to the menu, while 366 students recommended adding more vegetables. So, if we divide the number of students who recommended adding more beef by the total number of students, we get:  42/408 = 0.1025 or approximately 10.25% of the students recommended adding more beef.  Similarly, if we divide the number of students who recommended adding more vegetables by the total number of students, we get:  366/408 = 0.902 or approximately 90.2% of the students recommended adding more vegetables. Therefore, based on this data, it appears that a larger percentage of students recommended adding more vegetables than beef to the menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 479 students who recommended adding more vegetables to the menu, and 489 students who recommended adding more beef to the menu. Now, let's find out how many more students recommended adding more beef compared to those who recommended adding more vegetables. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who recommended adding more vegetables from the number of students who recommended adding more beef. So, if we subtract 479 from 489, we get:  489 - 479 = 10  Therefore, there are 10 more students who recommended adding more beef to the menu compared to those who recommended adding more vegetables.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 310 students recommended adding more vegetables in their meals, and 185 students recommended adding more meat. So, if we add both numbers together, we get:  310 + 185 = 495 students. Therefore, there are 495 students who recommended adding more ingredients to their meals.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 288 students in total. Of those, 264 students recommended adding more beef to the menu, and the remaining 24 students (288 - 264 = 24) recommended adding more mushrooms. Therefore, the number of students who recommended adding more mushrooms is 24.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 457 students in total. Of those, 63 students recommended adding more beef to the menu, while 457 - 63 = 394 students did not recommend adding more beef. Therefore, the percentage of students who recommended adding more beef is (63/457) x 100% = 13.8%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 182 students in total. Of those, 166 students recommended adding more beef to the menu, while 16 students did not recommend it. Therefore, the percentage of students who recommended adding more beef is:  166/182 x 100% = 91.7%  So, approximately 92% of the students recommended adding more beef to the menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 324 students in total who have recommended new menu items. Of those, 374 students have recommended adding more meat dishes, and 128 students have recommended adding more vegetarian options. Therefore, to calculate the total number of students who have recommended adding new menu items, we can add the three numbers together:  374 + 128 + 324 = 806 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 257 students in total. Of those, 120 students recommended adding more beef to the menu, and 97 students recommended adding more mushrooms. Therefore, the total number of students who recommended adding ingredients to the menu is 120 + 97 = 217 students. Now, let's find out how many students did not recommend adding any ingredients to the menu. To do this, we subtract the total number of students who recommended adding ingredients from the total number of students, like this:  257 - 217 = 40 students. So, there were 40 students who did not recommend adding any ingredients to the menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 144 students in total who recommended the menu. Secondly, we know that each student recommended an average of 467 dishes. Therefore, the total number of dishes recommended is:  144 x 467 = 65,328 dishes. Finally, we know that 79 students recommended adding more mushrooms to the menu. So, the number of mushrooms recommended is:  79 x (467 - 1) = 79 x 466 = 36,534 mushrooms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 228 students who recommended adding more vegetables to the menu. Next, we have 337 students who suggested adding more meat to the dishes. Lastly, we have 23 students who recommended adding more spices to the food. To find out how many students in total recommended adding more ingredients, let's add up all these numbers:  228 + 337 + 23 = 598 students. Therefore, 598 students in total recommended adding more ingredients to the school lunch menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 450 students in total and 38 of them recommended adding beef to the menu. Therefore, the number of students who did not recommend adding beef is:  450 - 38 = 412.  Next, we need to find out how many of these 412 students recommended adding new dishes to the menu. We know that 66 students recommended adding new dishes, so:  412 - 66 = 346.  Finally, we want to know how many students did not recommend adding any new dishes. This can be found by subtracting the number of students who recommended adding new dishes from the total number of students:  346 + 66 = 412.  So, there were 66 students who did not recommend adding any new dishes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 218 students who recommended adding more beef to the menu. Secondly, we know that there are 351 students in total. Therefore, we can calculate the percentage of students who recommended adding more beef as follows: (218/351) x 100% = 62%. So, approximately 62% of the students recommended adding more beef to the menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 269 students who recommended adding more beef to the menu. Next, we have 330 students who recommended adding more mashed potatoes. Lastly, we have 76 students who recommended adding more gravy. To find out how many students in total recommended adding more of each ingredient, we can add up the numbers:  269 + 330 + 76 = 675 students. Therefore, there are 675 students who recommended adding more of at least one of these three ingredients to the menu.
Response:  We know that there are 569 female students and 236 male students in total. To find out how many more female students than male students, we can subtract the number of male students from the number of female students.  569 - 236 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 333. Therefore, there are 333 more female students than male students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.  841 - 34 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 807 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 485 students in total. Secondly, we know that there are 232 female students. Therefore, to find out how many male students there are, we can subtract the number of female students from the total number of students. So, Male Students = Total Students - Female Students Male Students = 485 - 232 Male Students = 253 There are 253 male students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 697 students in total, and among them, there are 228 female students. So, the number of male students can be found by subtracting the number of female students from the total number of students:  697 - 228 = 469  Therefore, there are 469 male students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 635 students in total (given). Of these, 510 are female students (given), which means there are 125 male students (calculated). Therefore, the number of male students is 125.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 868 students in total, and among them, there are 281 female students. So, to find out how many male students there are, we can subtract the number of female students from the total number of students:  868 - 281 = 587 Therefore, there are 587 male students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 700 female students and 142 male students in total. So, if we add both numbers together, we get:  700 + 142 = 842  Therefore, the total number of students in this school is 842.
Response:  First, we know that there are 706 female students and 222 male students in total. Next, we know that an additional 418 female students have enrolled, bringing the total number of female students to 706 + 418 = 1124. Therefore, the total number of students in the school at this point is 706 (female) + 222 (male) + 418 (additional female) = 1346.
Response:  First, we know that there are 902 female students and 811 male students in total. Next, we know that there are 44 more female students than before. So, to find out how many female students there are altogether, we can add 44 to 902.  902 + 44 = 946 Therefore, there are 946 female students in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 632 female students and 410 male students in total. Next, we know that there are additional 465 female students enrolled in the school. So, to find out how many more female students than male students have been enrolled, we can subtract the number of male students from the total number of female students.  632 (female) - 410 (male) =?  To solve for the difference between the two numbers, we can simply subtract the smaller number from the larger number:  632 - 410 = 222. Therefore, there are 222 more female students than male students who have been enrolled in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in total. Next, we see that there are 682 more girls than boys. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we get:  732 - 761 = -39 (girls) + 682 = 643 (boys) Therefore, there are 643 boys in the school. Now, let's find out how many girls are left. We can do this by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of girls:  732 - 643 = 89 (girls) Thus, there are 89 girls left in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in total.  Next, we know that the number of girls increased by 496, so the new number of girls is 135 + 496 = 631.  Similarly, the number of boys increased by 910, so the new number of boys is 214 + 910 = 1124.  Therefore, the total number of students in the school after the increase is 631 (girls) + 1124 (boys) = 1755.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 308 female students and 318 male students in the school. Next, we know that there are 36 teachers in total. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  308 + 318 + 36 = 702 people in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 315 female students and 309 male students in the school. Next, we know that there are 772 teachers in total. Therefore, to find out how many people are in the school altogether, we need to add up the number of students and teachers. So, the total number of people in the school is:  315 + 309 + 772 = 1496  There are 1496 people in the school altogether.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 402 men in the school. Secondly, we know that there are 739 women in the school. Finally, we want to find out how many people (men + women) are in the school. So, let's add the number of men and women together:  402 + 739 =? Solution:  Therefore, there are 1141 people in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 458 men in the school. Secondly, we know that there are 692 women in total. Finally, we want to find out how many students are there in the school altogether. So, let's add the number of men and women together.  458 + 692 = 1150 Therefore, there are 1150 students in the school altogether.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 362 male students and 257 female students in total. Next, we know that there are 403 new female students joining the school. So, to find out how many more female students have joined compared to male students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of new students.   Total new students = 403   Male students already enrolled = 362   Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:   New female students = Total new students - Male students already enrolled   = 403 - 362   = 41   So, there are 41 more female students who have joined the school compared to male students.
Response:  First, we know that Ed has $18 dollars and spends $16 dollars. So, how much money does Ed have left?  We can subtract $16 from $18 to find out:  18 - 16 =?  Yes, that's right! Ed has $2 left.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has $13 dollars in total and he spends some money on certain things. So, the amount of money he has left is:  
$13 - x (where x is the amount of money he spent)  Now, we are told that Ed has $3 dollars left. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
$13 - x = $3  To solve for x, we can add $13 to both sides of the equation:  
$13 + $13 - x = $3 + $3  This simplifies to:  
26 - x = $6  Subtracting $6 from both sides gives us:  
20 = x  Therefore, Ed spent $20 on various things."
Response:  First, we know that Ed spent 9 dol-lars and then he spent 8 dol-lars more. So, in total, Ed spent 9 + 8 = 17 dol-lars. Now, if Ed has 17 dol-lars and he wants to spend 8 dol-lars more, how much money will he have left? To find out, we can subtract 8 from 17: 17 - 8 = 9. Therefore, Ed will have 9 dol-lars left after spending 8 dol-lars more.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of each book is THB 92. So if Ed wants to buy 16 books, he will have to pay for 16 x THB 92 = THB 1472. Now, let's check how much money Ed has before buying the books. We are given that Ed has THB 6000. Therefore, after subtracting the amount he needs to spend on books (THB 1472), Ed will be left with THB 6000 - THB 1472 = THB 4528.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each book costs 6 dollars. So if she buys two books, it will be 6 x 2 = 12 dollars in total.   Therefore, the cost of each book is 12/2 = 6 dollars per book.
Response:  Firstly, she spent 6 baht to buy a book and 16 baht to buy a pencil case, so in total, she spent 22 baht. Therefore, she has 19 - 22 = 7 baht left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that she has 12 dollars to spend in total. Secondly, she spends 4 dollars on books and 3 dollars on pencils. So, how much does she have left after buying both items? To find out, let's subtract the amount spent on each item from her total money.  4 dollars - 12 dollars = 8 dollars (left after buying books) 3 dollars - 12 dollars = 9 dollars (left after buying pencils) Now, add up the amounts left after buying each item to find out how much she has in total. 8 + 9 = 17 dollars Therefore, she has 17 dollars left after buying both items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of buying books is THB 16 dolla...
Response:  Firstly, Ed received $17 from his friend. Then he spent $10 to buy something. So how much money does Ed have left? We can calculate it as follows:  17 - 10 =?  The result is: 7 dollars. Therefore, Ed has $7 left after spending $10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sakhon has to make 44 copies of the project in total. Secondly, he can make each copy in 58 minutes. Therefore, if we divide 44 by 58, we get: 44 / 58 = 760 minutes  So, Sakhon needs 760 minutes or approximately 12 hours and 40 minutes to complete all 44 copies of the project.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has made 51 batches of popcorn and Davide has made 44 batches. To find out who has made more batches, we need to compare these numbers.  51 is greater than 44, so Sara has made more batches than Davide. Specifically, Sara has made 9 more batches (51 - 44 = 9) than Davide.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has done 44 push-ups in one set. Secondly, we are asked to find out how many times Sarah can do 9 push-ups. To do this, we need to divide the number of push-ups David did (44) by the number of push-ups Sarah can do (9). So, we have:  44 / 9 = 5 Therefore, Sarah can do 5 sets of 9 push-ups each.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that David has done 51 push-ups in total. Secondly, we know that he has done more than 49 push-ups because he said ""more than"". So, let's add 49 to 51 and get:  51 + 49 = 100. Therefore, David has done 100 push-ups in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sakhon has 59 crimes in total and he committed 44 crimes during his school days. So, the number of crimes he committed outside of school is:  59 - 44 = 15.  Next, we need to find out how many times Sakhon was arrested for each crime. We are given that he was arrested 19 times for one crime, but the total number of arrests is not equal to the number of crimes. Therefore, we can deduce that Sakhon was arrested more than once for some of the crimes. Let's assume that he was arrested k times for the first crime, where k is a positive integer. Then, we have:  19 x (k + 1) = 59 Since Sakhon committed 15 crimes outside of school, we can substitute 15 for 59 in the above equation:  19 x (k + 1) = 15 Now solve for k:  19k + 19 = 15 Solve for k:  k = 8 Thus, Sakhon was arrested 8 times for the first crime. Now, let's calculate the total number of times he was arrested:  19 x 8 + 19 = 44 + 19 = 63 Therefore, Sakhon was arrested 63 times in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sakhon has made 44 batches of porridge in total. Secondly, within those 44 batches, there were 17 small batches (less than 29). Therefore, to find out how many times Sakhon made small batches, we can subtract the number of large batches from the total number of batches:  44 - 29 = 15. So, Sakhon made small batches 15 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has to make 53 batches of cookies in total. She makes 14 batches per day and each batch contains 10 cookies. Therefore, she needs to make 53/14 = 3 batches per day.   Now, let's calculate how many cookies Sara needs to bake for each batch. Since there are 10 cookies in each batch, she needs to bake 3 x 10 = 30 cookies per day.  So, the final answer is 30 cookies per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has to make 35 batches of popcorn in total. She makes two batches at a time, so she needs to do this 17 times (35 / 2 = 17). Therefore, Sara will make a total of 17 x 2 = 34 batches of popcorn. However, she also needs to make one more batch, which means she will make a total of 35 batches. So, the correct answer is:  35
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has to make 46 and 58 copies of her project in total. This means she needs to make at least 46 + 58 = 104 copies of her project. However, based on the information given, Sara made only 38 copies of her project. Therefore, the difference between the number of copies Sara made and the total number of copies she needed to make is:  104 - 38 = 66 copies. So, Sara had to make an additional 66 copies of her project beyond what she initially planned to do.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sakhon has 19 times more money than Daovid. So if Daovid has 39 baht, Sakhon would have 19 x 39 = 761 baht. Next, we are told that Daovid spends 13 baht on something. Therefore, Sakhon would spend 761 - 13 = 748 baht. Finally, we want to find out how many times Daovid can buy what Sakhon buys with his money. We know that Sakhon has 748 baht and Daovid has 39 baht, so we can divide 748 by 39 to get the number of times Daovid can buy what Sakhon buys: 748 / 39 = 19. Therefore, Daovid can buy what Sakhon buys 19 times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sakhon has to make 51 papayas in total. Secondly, he already made 22 papayas, so he needs to make an additional 29 papayas. Thirdly, Daovid can make 4 papayas per day, so he will need 7 days to make all 29 papayas (29 = 4 x 7). Therefore, the number of times Daovid makes papayas is 7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has made 15 cakes in total. Secondly, we know that David has made 39 cakes in total. Thirdly, we know that John has made fewer than David (9 cakes). Therefore, to find out how many times John has made cakes, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  15 = 39 + x where x is the number of times John has made cakes. To solve for x, we subtract 39 from both sides of the equation:  15 - 39 = x - 39 16 = x - 39 Subtracting 39 from both sides gives us:  16 = x So, John has made cakes 16 times.
"Response:  If David can do 37 push-ups in one set, and he does 3 sets, then he will have done a total of 3 x 37 = 111 push-ups.  
If Sarah can do 25 push-ups in one set, and she also does 3 sets, then she will have done a total of 3 x 25 = 75 push-ups."
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has done 56 handstand push-ups in total. Secondly, we are asked to find out how many times he did 38 handstand push-ups if he did more than 38 handstand push-ups in total. To do this, we need to subtract the number of handstand push-ups David did from the total number of handstand push-ups he did. So, we can set up an equation as follows: Total Handstand Push-Ups - Number of Handstand Push-Ups = Number of Times David Did More Than 38 Handstand Push-Ups. In other words, we can write: 56 - x = 38 where x is the number of times David did more than 38 handstand push-ups. Now, let's solve for x. We can add 38 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the negative number: 56 + x = 38 + 38 This simplifies to: 2x = 76 Subtracting 38 from both sides gives us: 2x = 38 Divide both sides by 2 to find x: x = 19 Therefore, David did 19 more than 38 handstand push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has done push-ups for 40 rounds, but he only did 17 rounds today. So, to find out how many rounds David does in total, we can subtract the number of rounds he did today from the total number of rounds he has done. Total rounds = 40 - 17 = 23 Therefore, David does push-ups for 23 rounds each day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has done 36 rounds of push-ups in total. Secondly, he did 33 rounds of push-ups each time he exercised, which is less than the total number of rounds he did (36). Therefore, we can calculate the number of times David exercised as follows:  36 / 33 = 1 + 1 +... + 1 (36/33) = 4 times  So, David exercised four times, and each time he did 33 rounds of push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has done 27 push-ups in total today, and he did each set of push-ups for 7 times. So, if we calculate the total number of push-ups he did for each set, it would be:  27 x 7 = 190 push-ups.  Now, let's focus on the last part of the question. We are asked to find out how many more push-ups David needs to do to reach the same amount as Sarah, who did 5 sets of 17 push-ups each. To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the total number of push-ups Sarah did:  190 - 17 x 5 = 190 - 85 = 105 push-ups. Therefore, David needs to do an additional 105 push-ups to reach the same amount as Sarah.
Response:  If we have to do 5 pages of content and 2 pages of reading comprehension, then we need to calculate how many more pages of critical thinking are required.   To calculate this, let's use the formula: Total Pages = (Content Pages x Reading Comprehension Pages) / 2.  In our case, Total Pages = (5 x 2) / 2 = 10/2 = 5 pages.  Therefore, we need to add 5 more pages of critical thinking to the original 5 pages of content and 2 pages of reading comprehension.
"Response:  To write an article with 3 main points and 4 subpoints for each main point, we need to have a total of 3 x 4 = 12 paragraphs in the article.   Therefore, if we want to compare the number of paragraphs required for writing an article with 3 main points and 4 subpoints versus the number of paragraphs required for writing an article with 5 main points and 6 subpoints, we can say that:

Number of paragraphs required for writing an article with 3 main points and 4 subpoints = 12 paragraphs

Number of paragraphs required for writing an article with 5 main points and 6 subpoints = 15 paragraphs (since 5 x 6 = 30 subpoints)

So, there are 3 more paragraphs required for writing an article with 5 main points and 6 subpoints compared to writing an article with 3 main points and 4 subpoints."

Now, let's calculate how many pages each book has based on the given information:  Book 1 (reading comprehension): 2 pages x 4 questions per page = 8 pages Book 2 (vocabulary and grammar): 2 pages x 3 questions per page = 6 pages Book 3 (writing and speaking): 2 pages x 5 questions per page = 10 pages Therefore, we have: Book 1: 8 pages Book 2: 6 pages Book 3: 10 pages Total number of pages: 8 + 6 + 10 = 24 pages So, there are 24 pages in total for all three books."
Response:  We have 11 pages of content for the first topic (knowledge management), and we need to add 2 more pages for the second topic (reading comprehension) and 3 more pages for the third topic (critical thinking). Therefore, the total number of pages needed is:  11 + 2 + 3 = 16 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 pages of content in the first book, and each page has 11 lines of text. Therefore, the total number of lines of text in the first book is:  7 x 11 = 77 lines.  Next, we know that there are 8 pages of content in the second book, and each page has 8 lines of text. Therefore, the total number of lines of text in the second book is:  8 x 8 = 64 lines.  Finally, we need to find out how many more lines of text are in the second book compared to the first book. To do this, we can subtract the total number of lines of text in the first book from the total number of lines of text in the second book:  64 - 77 = 9 fewer lines of text in the first book.  So, the difference between the two books is 9 lines of text.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of pages for each type of homework:  1. Homework on comprehension (9 pages) + 2. Homework on analysis (11 pages) + 3. Homework on critical thinking and creativity (29 pages) = Total number of pages: 49 pages.

Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, if we add up all the emails he received, we get:  6 + 2 = 8 emails.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the total number of emails he received in the afternoon. So, if we subtract 6 from 8, we get:  8 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 1 email in the afternoon, then he received a total of 4 + 1 = 5 emails that day.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 3 + 5 = 8 emails today.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 13 emails. Next, we know that he received 72 emails in the evening. So, to find out how many emails Jack received in total, we need to add 13 + 72 = 85 emails. Therefore, Jack received 85 emails in total.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning, so he received 0 emails in the afternoon and evening (since there is no overlap). Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received during the day was 4.
"Response:  First, we know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning, so he received 0 emails in the afternoon and evening since there is no email marked as ""afternoon"" or ""evening"". Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received in the morning is 3."
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 7 emails in the afternoon, and 17 emails in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning.   So, if we subtract 7 from 10, we get:  10 - 7 = 3  Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 emails in the afternoon, and 7 emails in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, let's do that:  9 (morning) - 7 (evening) = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the evening.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails he received is 5 + 4 = 9 emails.  
Now, let's consider the distribution of these emails across the three time periods. In the morning, Jack received 5 emails, which means he received 3 more emails than he did in the evening (since there were only 4 emails in the evening). So, if we subtract 3 from 5, we get 2. This tells us that Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the evening.  Finally, to find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon, we add up all the emails he received during each time period: 9 (total) - 5 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 6 emails.  Therefore, Jack received 6 emails in the afternoon."
Response:  Firstly, Jack received 6 emails in the morning. Secondly, he received 3 emails in the afternoon. Lastly, he received other emails (not specified) in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received that day is:  6 + 3 + X = 9 + X  where X is the number of emails he received in the evening. Since we know that Jack received 10 emails that day, we can set up an equation:  9 + X = 10  Solving for X, we get:  X = 1  So, Jack received 1 email in the evening.
Response:  Firstly, Jack received 3 emails in the morning and each email had 5 attachments, so he received a total of 3 x 5 = 15 attachments in the morning.  Then, he received 5 more emails in the afternoon, and each email had 4 attachments, so he received a total of 5 x 4 = 20 attachments in the afternoon. Therefore, in total, Jack received 15 + 20 = 35 attachments that day.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 6 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 11 emails.  Next, we know that he received 9 more emails in the evening, bringing the total to 20 emails. Therefore, the correct answer is:  20
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack received 10 emails in total during the morning shift and afternoon shift combined. This means he received 5 emails in each shift (10/2 = 5).   Next, we are told that Jack received an additional 3 emails in the afternoon shift, bringing the total number of emails he received to 8 (5 + 3). Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning shift and the afternoon shift is 8 - 5 = 3. So, Jack received 3 more emails in the afternoon shift than he did in the morning shift.
Response:  Firstly, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails. Secondly, he received 8 additional emails in the morning, so he received a total of 8 + 8 = 16 emails. Therefore, Jack received a total of 16 emails.
Response:  Firstly, Jack received 6 emails in total and sent 91 emails in total during the morning shift. This means he received 6/91 = 0.065 emails per email sent (ratio of received emails to sent emails).  Next, Jack received 2 emails in total and sent 74 emails in total during the afternoon shift. This means he received 2/74 = 0.027 emails per email sent (ratio of received emails to sent emails) during the afternoon shift.  Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received throughout the day was 0.065 x 91 + 0.027 x 74 = 58.3 + 2.0 = 60.3 emails.
Response:  Firstly, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and sent 2 emails back. So, he received a total of 4 + 2 = 6 emails in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 8 more emails and sent 2 more emails back. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received that day is 6 + 8 = 14 emails.
Response:  Firstly, Jack received 7 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of emails he received is 7 + 2 = 9 emails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning, and 16 emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails he received during the day is 3 + 16 = 19 emails.   Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 6 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of emails he received is 3 + 6 = 9 emails.   Next, we are told that Jack received additional emails in the evening, but the information does not specify how many emails he received. So, let's assume that he received x additional emails in the evening. In this case, the total number of emails Jack received would be 9 + x.  Finally, we are asked to determine how many emails Jack received in total if he received 10 emails in one day. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  Total Number of Emails = 9 (morning and afternoon) + x (evening)  Substituting x with 10 (since Jack received 10 emails in the evening), we get:  Total Number of Emails = 9 + 10 = 19 emails  Therefore, Jack received 19 emails in total for that day.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many steps it takes for Tuk-Tuk to reach the destination if he goes straight without any detours.  We know that Tuk-Tuk travels at a constant speed of 9 niwat (units per hour). So, if he travels for x hours, he will cover a distance of 9x niwat. Now, let's consider the detour. If Tuk-Tuk takes a detour of 12 niwat, he will cover an additional distance of 12 niwat. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Tuk-Tuk including the detour is 9x + 12 niwat. To find out how many hours Tuk-Tuk needs to travel to reach the destination with the detour, we can divide the total distance by his constant speed: 9x + 12 / 9 = x + 1. So, Tuk-Tuk needs to travel for x + 1 hours to reach the destination with the detour. The value of x can be found by solving this equation: x + 1 = 9(3) + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39. Therefore, Tuk-Tuk needs to travel for 39 hours to reach the destination with the detour.
Response:  First, we know that the total area of the two rectangles is equal to the sum of their individual areas.  So, we can write:  Area = Length x Width.  For the first rectangle, the length is 31 and the width is 2, so the area is:  Area = 31 x 2 = 62 square inches.  For the second rectangle, the length is 35 and the width is 4, so the area is:  Area = 35 x 4 = 140 square inches.  Therefore, the total area of both rectangles is:  Total Area = 62 + 140 = 202 square inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the tiger is 36 inches (91 cm). Secondly, we know that the length of the goat is equal to the length of the tiger minus 17 inches (43 cm). Finally, we know that the length of the mouse is equal to the length of the goat minus 15 inches (38 cm). So, let's start with the length of the tiger: 36 inches (91 cm) Now, let's find the length of the goat: Goat length = Tiger length - 17 inches Goat length = 36 inches - 17 inches Goat length = 19 inches (48 cm) Next, let's find the length of the mouse: Mouse length = Goat length - 15 inches Mouse length = 19 inches - 15 inches Mouse length = 4 inches (10 cm) Therefore, the length of the tiger is 36 inches (91 cm), the length of the goat is 19 inches (48 cm), and the length of the mouse is 4 inches (10 cm).
Response:  To calculate the distance traveled by the chicken, we need to know the speed of the treadmill and the time it took for the chicken to walk that distance.  Here are some assumptions we can make based on the information given:  1. The treadmill is set at a constant speed of 5 km/h. 2. The chicken walks at a steady pace and does not stop or slow down during the experiment. 3. The chicken covers the same distance as the treadmill, so there is no slipping or sliding.  Now let's calculate the distance traveled by the chicken using the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (in this case, the speed of the treadmill), and t is the time taken to cover that distance. In this case, the distance traveled by the chicken is: d = 5 km/h x 30 min = 750 m So, the chicken has traveled 750 meters in 30 minutes while walking on the treadmill.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the two points (A and B) is equal to the sum of the distances between A and C, and between C and B. Therefore, we can write: Distance = Distance + Distance  Next, we are given that the distance between A and C is 19 units, and the distance between C and B is 10 units. So, we can substitute these values into the equation above: Distance = 19 + 10 Distance = 29 units Finally, we need to find out how many units the distance between A and B is. To do this, we can subtract the distance between A and C from the total distance: Distance between A and B = Total distance - Distance between A and C Distance between A and B = 29 - 19 Distance between A and B = 10 units Therefore, the distance between A and B is 10 units.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the tiger is 19 feet (6 meters) and its height is 39 feet (12 meters). Next, we need to find out how many elephants can fit in the tiger's body. To do this, we divide the tiger's length by the length of an elephant. According to the information provided, an elephant is 94 feet (29 meters) long. Therefore, we have: 19 ft / 94 ft = 0.204 or approximately 20% of an elephant can fit inside a tiger's body.
Response:  To calculate the distance traveled by the chicken, we need to know the speed of the treadmill and the time it took for the chicken to walk that distance.  Here are some assumptions we can make based on the information given:  1. The treadmill is set at a constant speed of 5 km/h. 2. The chicken walks at a steady pace and does not stop or slow down during the experiment. 3. The chicken covers the same distance as the treadmill, so there is no slipping or sliding.  Now let's calculate the distance traveled by the chicken using the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (in this case, the speed of the treadmill), and t is the time taken to cover that distance. In this case, the distance traveled by the chicken is: d = 5 km/h x 30 min = 750 m So, the chicken has traveled 750 meters in 30 minutes while walking on the treadmill.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the tiger is 24 inches (60 cm). Secondly, we know that the length of the turtle is 33 inches (84 cm). Thirdly, we know that the length of the mouse is 5 inches (13 cm). Now, let's compare the lengths of these three animals. We can see that the length of the tiger is greater than the length of the turtle, and the length of the turtle is greater than the length of the mouse. So, we can rank them in order from longest to shortest as follows:  Tiger > Turtle > Mouse.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total length of the two sticks is 13 inches (2 x 6.5 inches).  Now, let's find out how many inches each stick can be cut into if they are to be cut into equal parts. To do this, we need to divide the total length by the number of parts we want to make. In this case, we want to make 2 equal parts. So, we divide 13 inches by 2:  13 inches / 2 = 6.5 inches per part.  Therefore, each stick can be cut into 6.5-inch pieces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total length of the two pieces of wood is 35 inches (100 cm). We also know that one piece of wood has been cut into four equal parts, each with a length of 4 inches (10 cm). Therefore, the number of pieces of wood that have been cut is: 35 / 4 = 8.5 So, there are eight and a half pieces of wood that have been cut from the original piece.
Response:  To calculate the distance traveled by the chicken, we need to know the speed of the treadmill and the time it took for the chicken to walk that distance.  Here are some assumptions we can make based on the information given:  1. The treadmill is set at a constant speed of 5 km/h. 2. The chicken walks at a steady pace and does not stop or slow down during the experiment. 3. The chicken covers the same distance as the treadmill, so there is no slipping or sliding.  Now let's calculate the distance traveled by the chicken using the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (in this case, the speed of the treadmill), and t is the time taken to cover that distance. In this case, the distance traveled by the chicken is: d = 5 km/h x 30 min = 750 m So, the chicken has traveled 750 meters in 30 minutes while walking on the treadmill.

Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the tiger is 21 feet (ตัวตุ่นกระโดดได้ 21 นิ้ว). Secondly, we know that the length of the elephant is greater than the length of the tiger. So, we can write an inequality:  Length of elephant > Length of tiger  Thirdly, we are given that the length of the elephant is 25 feet (ตัวตุ่นกระโดดได้ไกลกว่ากบ 25 นิ้ว). Therefore, we can substitute the value into the inequality:  25 > 21 Fourthly, we can simplify the inequality:  4 > 3 Fifthly, we can solve for the difference between the two lengths:  4 - 3 = 1 Sixthly, we can find out how many feet the elephant is longer than the tiger:  1 foot Seventhly, we can convert the length from feet to inches:  1 foot x 12 inches/foot = 12 inches Eighthly, we can round down the length to the nearest inch:  12 inches rounded down to 10 inches Ninthly, we can state our final answer:  The elephant is 10 inches longer than the tiger.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the distance traveled by Tuk-Tuk A in 39 minutes. We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 600 meters, so we can use this conversion factor to find out how many kilometers Tuk-Tuk A has traveled.  

Therefore, the distance traveled by Tuk-Tuk A in 39 minutes is: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = (600 m/km) x (39 min / 60 min) Distance = 600 x 0.65 Distance = 390 km Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by Tuk-Tuk B in 17 minutes. Using the same formula as before: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = (600 m/km) x (17 min / 60 min) Distance = 600 x 0.28 Distance = 168 km Therefore, Tuk-Tuk A has traveled 390 km and Tuk-Tuk B has traveled 168 km."

Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the tiger (L) is 37 cm, and the length of the rabbit (R) is 16 cm. We also know that the length of the fox (F) is less than the length of the rabbit. So, F < R. Now, let's calculate the ratio of the lengths of the three animals. Ratio of L to R = 37/16 = 2 1/2. Since the fox is shorter than the rabbit, the ratio of F to R must be less than 2 1/2. Therefore, the length of the fox can be calculated as follows: F = R x (2 1/2 - 1) = R x 1 1/2 = 16 x 1 1/2 = 24 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry needs to add 14 cups of water to make 6 cups of rice porridge. So, she needs to add 8 cups (14 - 6) of water. Now, if she wants to make more than 6 cups of rice porridge, she will need to add more water accordingly. For example, if she wants to make 8 cups of rice porridge, she will need to add 2 cups (8 - 6) of water. Therefore, the answer is 8 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already added 4 cups of water to the mixture, so she needs to add more water to make up for the remaining 7 cups. Therefore, Merry needs to add 7 - 4 = 3 cups of water to the mixture.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 6 pegs and 13 nails. So, if she needs to add more pegs, she will need to add 8 pegs (since 8 is greater than 13). Therefore, Merry will need to hammer in 8 + 6 = 14 pegs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 11 water and 7 sugar into the mixture. If she wants to add more ingredients, she will need to add 2 more cups of water and 1 more cup of sugar. Therefore, the total amount of water added will be 11 + 2 = 13 cups, and the total amount of sugar added will be 7 + 1 = 8 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 3 pegs and needs to add another 6 pegs to make it stable. So, the total number of pegs required = 3 + 6 = 9 pegs.
Response:  Firstly, she has already put in 12 sticks of incense and 5 bowls of water. If she needs to add more incense, she will need to add 2 more sticks (since 12 + 2 = 14). Therefore, the total number of sticks of incense used is 14.
Response:  First, we know that there are 9 cups of flour in total.  We also know that Merry has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 tablespoons of water to make the dough. So, if we subtract 3 cups of flour from 9 cups, we get 6 cups of flour left. Now, let's calculate how many more tablespoons of water Merry needs to add to make up for the remaining 6 cups of flour. To do this, we can divide the number of cups of flour by the number of tablespoons per cup (which is 4). This gives us:  6 cups x 4 tablespoons/cup = 24 tablespoons Therefore, Merry needs to add 24 tablespoons more of water to complete the recipe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has 5 apples and she gives 3 to her friend. So, how many apples does Merry have left?  5 - 3 = 2  Therefore, Merry has 2 apples left. Next, we are asked how much water should be added to make it 14 apples in total. We can calculate this as follows:  2 + x = 14  Where x is the amount of water needed. Solving for x, we get:  x = 12  Therefore, Merry needs 12 cups of water to make 14 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 eggs in total.  Of those, 5 eggs were used to make an omelette, leaving us with 7 eggs remaining. Next, we added 49 grams of flour and got 11 eggs left over after making the cake. So, if we subtract the number of eggs used for the omelette from the total number of eggs, we get:  7 (remaining eggs) - 5 (eggs used for omelette) = 2 eggs left over. Therefore, we need to add 2 more eggs to the recipe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already added 7 water drops to the mixture, so she needs to add more than 7 water drops to make up for the remaining amount of 10 water drops. Secondly, since each drop of water is worth 2 points, and Merry has already earned 80 points from her previous attempts, she needs to earn at least another 40 points (10 x 2 = 20) to reach her target score of 120 points. Therefore, Merry should aim to add enough water drops to earn an additional 40 points. To do this, she can calculate how many water drops she needs to add based on the value of one drop of water. One drop of water is worth 2 points, so Merry needs to add:  40 / 2 = 20 water drops.  So, Merry should add 20 more water drops to the mixture to reach her target score of 120 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 12 water and 14 sugar into the mixture. So, if she adds 7 more sugar, she will have a total of 12 + 14 + 7 = 33 ingredients in her cake mixture. However, since she only needs to add 2 more eggs, she can simply add 2 more eggs without adding any more sugar or water. Therefore, the final number of ingredients in Merry's cake mixture is 33 + 2 = 35.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already added 5 tablespoons of flour to the mixture. Therefore, if she adds 3 more tablespoons of flour, she will have a total of 5 + 3 = 8 tablespoons of flour in the mixture. Next, we need to determine how much water she should add to the mixture to make it just right. We are given that the recipe calls for 8 tablespoons of water for every 4 tablespoons of flour. So, since Merry has 8 tablespoons of flour, she needs to add 8 / 4 = 2 cups of water to the mixture. Finally, we know that Merry has already added 7 tablespoons of sugar to the mixture, so she does not need to add any more sugar. Therefore, the complete list of ingredients that Merry needs to add to the mixture is: 8 tablespoons of flour, 2 cups of water, and 7 tablespoons of sugar.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 cups of flour and 13 cups of water in the recipe. If she has already added 2 cups of water, then she needs to add another 11 cups of water (13 - 2 = 11) to make the dough.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry needs to add 9 cups of water to make 6 cups of rice porridge. So, she needs to add 3 cups of water (9 - 6 = 3). Now, if she adds 3 cups of water and then takes out 4 cups of water, how much water is left in the pot? To find this out, we need to subtract 4 from 3: 3 - 4 = -1. Therefore, there is one cup of water left in the pot after Merry takes out 4 cups of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 6 water and 9 ice cubes into the drink. So, if she wants to make it more watery, she needs to add more water. Now, let's calculate how much water she needs to add to achieve her desired level of waterness. We can start by subtracting the amount of ice cubes (9) from the total volume of the drink (12): 12 - 9 = 3. This means that Merry needs to add 3 units of water to the drink to make it more watery. However, since she only has 2 units of water left, she cannot achieve her desired level of waterness. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 5 water and 14 sugar into the mixture. So, if she adds 11 more water, she will have added a total of 5 + 11 = 16 water. Now, let's calculate how much sugar she needs to add to make the mixture sweet enough. We know that for every 2 cups of water, she needs to add 1 cup of sugar. Therefore, for 16 cups of water, she needs to add 16 / 2 = 8 cups of sugar. So, Merry needs to add 8 cups of sugar to the mixture after adding 11 cups of water.
Response:  Firstly, she has already put in 3 water and 10 soap pieces. So, if she needs to add more than 5 water and 10 soap pieces, it means she needs to add more than 18 (3 + 10) units of liquid and solid. Therefore, the total number of units of liquid and solid that she needs to add is:  18 + x + y  where x is the number of additional water units and y is the number of additional soap pieces. Since she needs to add more than 5 water units, we know that x > 5. Similarly, since she needs to add more than 10 soap pieces, we know that y > 10. So, the total number of units of liquid and solid that she needs to add can be represented as follows:  18 + x + y > 18 + 5 + 10 = 28. Therefore, the minimum amount of liquid and solid that she needs to add is at least 28 units.
Response:  Firstly, she has already put in 5 water and 13 soap. So, if she needs to add more soap, she will need to add 12 - 5 = 7 soap bars. Therefore, the total number of soap bars needed is 5 + 7 = 12.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 pieces of cake in total. Secondly, each piece of cake is cut into 2 equal parts, so there will be 28 pieces of cake halves (14 x 2). Thirdly, to make one serving of cake, you need 3/4 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water. Therefore, to prepare 28 servings of cake, you will need:  Milk: 28 x 3/4 cup = 21 cups Water: 28 x 1/2 cup = 14 cups So, to summarize, you will need 21 cups of milk and 14 cups of water to prepare 28 servings of cake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has 11 apples and she gives 9 of them to her friends. So, how many apples does Merry have left?  11 - 9 = 2  Therefore, Merry has 2 apples left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 6 pots of water (6 x 2 = 12 liters). Next, she needs to add another 3 pots of water to make it 15 pots in total. So, how many liters does she need to add?  3 pots x 2 liters per pot = 6 liters Therefore, Merry needs to add 6 liters more to reach her target of 15 pots.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 40 water lilies and she wants to add more. So, if she adds 9 more water lilies, she will have a total of 49 water lilies (40 + 9). However, since she needs at least 14 water lilies to make a bouquet, she cannot use all 49 water lilies for her bouquet. Therefore, she must choose only 14 water lilies from the 49 she has collected. To find out how many more water lilies she needs, we can subtract the number of water lilies she has chosen (14) from the total number of water lilies she has (49): 49 - 14 = 35. So, Merry needs 35 more water lilies to complete her bouquet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 2 pots of water (2 x 9 = 18 liters). Next, she needs to add more water to make up for the shortage of 4 liters. So, she needs to add 4 liters + 7 liters (from the next pot) = 11 liters. Therefore, Merry needs to add 11 liters of water to the cauldron.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already put in 6 water drops and added 9 more. So, she has used a total of 6 + 9 = 15 water drops. Now, to make the solution as sweet as possible, she wants to add more water drops. We can let x be the number of additional water drops she adds. Since she wants the solution to be as sweet as possible, we know that she will add as many water drops as possible without going over the limit of 12 water drops. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  15 + x = 12 (since there are 12 water drops in the solution already)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 12 - 15 = -3  However, since we cannot have a negative number of water drops, we know that Merry cannot add any more water drops. Therefore, the answer is 0 water drops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry has already added 4 tablespoons of water to the mixture. So, if she adds another 3 tablespoons of water, it will bring the total amount of water used in the recipe to:  4 + 3 = 7 tablespoons of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Merry needs to add 12 cups of water and 14 cups of sugar to make 10 cups of jam. So, she has already added 12 + 14 = 26 cups of liquid (water or sugar) to her mixture. Now, if she wants to increase the amount of jam by 10 cups more, she will need to add 10 cups of sugar to her existing mixture. Therefore, the total number of cups of sugar Merry needs to add is:  26 (cups of liquid already added) + 10 (cups of sugar to be added) = 36 cups of sugar.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 crows in total.  Secondly, we know that each crow has an average of 60 pieces of food in its stomach.  Therefore, the total amount of food eaten by all the crows is:  19 x 60 = 1140 pieces of food.  Now, let's consider the scenario where some crows fly away and leave their food behind.  If we assume that half of the crows (i.e., 10 crows) fly away, then the remaining crows will have to share the food among themselves.  The number of pieces of food left for each crow can be calculated as follows:  1140 - 10 x 60 = 570 pieces of food per crow.  So, if 10 crows fly away, each crow that stays behind will get approximately 570 pieces of food.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 crows in total. Secondly, if 7 crows fly away in a group, how many crows will be left behind? To find out, we need to subtract 7 from 87. So, 87 - 7 =?  The correct answer is 80. Therefore, there will be 80 crows left behind after 7 crows fly away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 crows in total, and they have been staying in this area for a while now. Secondly, we know that 14 of these crows have migrated to another place recently. So, if we subtract 14 from 20, we get:  20 - 14 = 6 Therefore, there are currently 6 crows left in the area.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 85 crows in total. Secondly, we know that 23 crows flew away to Africa and 37 crows flew away to Europe. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Total number of crows - Number of crows flown away = Number of crows left behind.  So, 85 - (23 + 37) =?  85 - 60 = 25.  There are 25 crows left behind near the mountain.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 cats in total.   Secondly, we know that 4 of them go to Africa and 3 go to Europe. Therefore, the number of cats left behind is 8 - (4 + 3) = 8 - 7 = 1 cat left behind.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 cats in total.   Secondly, we know that 1/4 of the cats go to Africa (94 cats). Therefore, the number of cats left behind is 38 - 94 = -56. This means that no cats are left behind! All 38 cats have gone either to Asia or Europe. Now, let's calculate how many cats went to each continent. We know that 1/2 of the remaining cats go to Asia (47 cats) and 1/2 go to Europe (47 cats as well). So, the number of cats that went to Asia is 47 / 2 = 23, and the number of cats that went to Europe is also 23.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 cats in total.   Secondly, we know that 38 cats flew to Africa. Therefore, the number of cats left behind is:  18 - 38 = -20 (subtracting 38 from 18 gives us -20).  However, this result does not make sense as it indicates that there are negative cats! So, let's try again.   This time, we can subtract 80 from 18:  18 - 80 = -62 (subtracting 80 from 18 gives us -62).  But again, this result doesn't make sense as it indicates that there are negative cats! Finally, we can divide 18 by 2 to get the average number of cats per flight:  18 / 2 = 9 (dividing 18 by 2 gives us 9).  Therefore, the answer is 9 cats per flight.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 existing cats in the neighborhood. If we add 18 new cats to the group, the total number of cats will be:  87 + 18 = 105 cats. Therefore, the number of cats living near the mountain is 105.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 crows in the forest near the mountain. Secondly, 24 new crows have come to live nearby. Lastly, some crows have flown away from their nests due to strong winds and heavy rain. So, if we subtract the number of crows who have flown away from the total number of crows, we will get the correct answer. Therefore, the number of crows left in the forest is:  49 - x = 24 + x, where x is the number of crows who have flown away. Solving for x, we get: x = 25. Hence, there are 25 crows who have flown away from their nests. Now, let's add the original number of crows (49) with the number of new crows (24), and then subtract the number of crows who have flown away (25): 49 + 24 - 25 =? Solution: 49 + 24 = 73. Subtracting 25 gives us: 73 - 25 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is: There are 48 crows left in the forest after some have flown away due to strong winds and heavy rain.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 birds in total.  Secondly, we know that 41 birds have flown away from the mountain.  Therefore, to find out how many birds are left near the mountain, we can subtract 41 from 27.  27 - 41 =?  The result is... 16!  So, there are 16 birds left near the mountain.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 86 crows in total. Secondly, we know that 45 crows flew away from the mountain and settled near the village. Therefore, to find out how many crows remained on the mountain, we need to subtract 45 from 86. So, the number of crows remaining on the mountain is:  86 - 45 = 41.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 craters in total.   Secondly, if there are 35 craters in one hemisphere and 62 craters in the other hemisphere, then the number of craters in each hemisphere is:   Thirdly, to find out how many more craters there are in the second hemisphere than in the first hemisphere, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:   Therefore, there are 27 more craters in the second hemisphere than in the first hemisphere.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 groups of crows living in the mountainous area. Each group has 9 crows, so there are totally 3 x 9 = 27 crows living in the mountains.   Secondly, we know that 2 groups of crows have migrated to the lowlands, and each group has 5 crows, so there are totally 2 x 5 = 10 crows who have migrated.  Finally, we know that there are still 26 crows left in the mountains after the migration. Therefore, the total number of crows is: 27 + 10 - 26 = 8 crows.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pal received 253 dinosaurs as birthday gifts on her birthday. Secondly, she gave away 70 dinosaurs to her friends. So, how many dinosaurs does Pal have left after giving them away? To find out, we can subtract the number of dinosaurs she gave away from the total number of dinosaurs she received. In this case, we can subtract 70 from 253. Here's the calculation:  253 - 70 =? The result is: 183. Therefore, Pal has 183 dinosaurs left after giving away 70 to her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pal received 551 dinosaurs in total and had to return 177 of them. So, how many dinosaurs did Pal receive in total?  551 - 177 =?  Yes, that's right! Pal received 374 dinosaurs in total.
Response:  First, we know that Pohn received 440 dinos in total during his birthday celebration. Next, he gave 111 dinos to his friends, leaving him with 329 dinos. Finally, he lost 106 dinos, leaving him with 223 dinos. So, the number of dinos Pohn has left is 223.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Poh received 65 dinosaurs as birthday gifts from her friends in one year. Secondly, she gave 16 dinosaurs to her friend who was moving away. Finally, she had 49 dinosaurs left (16 + 49 = 65). So, the total number of dinosaurs Poh had at the end of the year was 49.
Response:  Firstly, we know that พอล (Pol) received 589 dinosaurs as a gift from his friend in one day. Secondly, he gave 571 dinosaurs to his other friend. Finally, he was left with 161 dinosaurs. To find out how many more dinosaurs Pol received than he gave away, we can subtract the number of dinosaurs he gave away from the total number of dinosaurs he received:  589 - 571 = 18 Therefore, Pol received 18 more dinosaurs than he gave away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pal received 110 dinosaurs from his birthday in one year. Secondly, he gave 90 dinosaurs to his friend. Finally, he was left with 412 dinosaurs. To find out how many more dinosaurs Pal had after giving 90 to his friend, we can subtract 90 from 412:  412 - 90 =? Solution:  412 - 90 = 322. Therefore, Pal had 322 dinosaurs more after giving 90 to his friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of days between the birthday and the day when the money was given (558 - 563) is 5 days.   Secondly, we know that the amount of money given to each friend on the birthday is 332 dinars. Therefore, if there are x friends, the total amount of money spent on them would be 332x dinars. Now, let's find out how many friends the person has. We can do this by dividing the total amount of money spent on them by the amount of money given to each friend: 332x / 332 = x So, the person has x = 5 friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Poh received 52 gifts of chocolate from her friends during her birthday celebration.  Next, we are told that she gave away 492 pieces of candy to her classmates. Therefore, the total number of candies given away by Poh is:  52 + 492 = 544 pieces of candy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Poh has received 521 din-so and 66 luuk-in (a type of Thai dessert) as gifts on her birthday. Secondly, she has given away 154 din-so to her friends. Finally, we want to find out how many more din-so she has left after giving them away. To do this, we can subtract the number of din-so she gave away from the total number of din-so she received:  521 - 154 =?  The answer is: 367 din-so.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the mountain is 531 meters and there are 38 peaks in total. Next, we need to calculate how much land has been eroded due to deforestation. To do this, we subtract the original height of the mountain (531 m) from the current height after deforestation (391 m). Therefore, the amount of land erosion can be calculated as follows:  531 - 391 = 140 meters So, approximately 140 meters of land have been eroded due to deforestation.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the mountain is 601 meters and the distance traveled along the route is 406 kilometers. Next, we need to calculate how many liters of water are needed for each kilometer traveled. To do this, we divide the total amount of water consumed (336 liters) by the number of kilometers traveled (406 km): 336 liters / 406 km = 0.825 liters/km Now, let's multiply this value by the total distance traveled to get the total amount of water needed for the entire journey: 0.825 liters/km x 406 km = 336.2 liters Therefore, approximately 336.2 liters of water would be needed for the entire journey.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the student scored 291 points in the final examination and received 315 points in total. Therefore, to find out how many points he scored in each subject, we need to subtract the total score from the final examination score.  291 - 315 =?  Next, let's calculate the number of points he scored in each subject.  We can start by finding out how many points he scored in the first subject.  To do this, we will divide the difference between the total score and the final examination score by the number of subjects.   (315 - 291) / 2 =?  Finally, we can determine the number of points he scored in each subject by multiplying the result of the previous calculation by two.  2 x? = 315 - 291  Now, let's substitute the values we have found into the equation.  2 x 140 = 315 - 291  Simplify the equation.  2 x 140 = 315 - 291 2 x 140 = 175  Therefore, the student scored 175 points in the first subject.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of days in a year is 365 (or 366 in leap years). Secondly, we are given that the number of dinosaurs received from friends during the birthday party was 308. Finally, we need to find out how many more days the dinosaur had to give away compared to the number of days it received. To do this, we subtract the number of days received from the total number of days in a year:  365 - 308 = 57 So, the dinosaur gave away 57 more days worth of dino-days than it received.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of dinosaurs is 457 + 320 = 777. Next, we know that the number of extinct dinosaurs is 523. Therefore, the number of surviving dinosaurs is 777 - 523 = 254. So there are 254 surviving dinosaurs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 employees in total, and some of them have left (we don't know how many). So, the number of remaining employees is 11 - x, where x is the number of employees who have left. Now, we are told that there are 3 new employees joining the company. Therefore, the total number of employees now is 11 - x + 3 =?  To find out the value of x, we can use the fact that the sum of all the numbers must be equal to the total number of employees. In other words, 11 - x + 3 = 11. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So, there are 4 employees who have left the company, and the total number of employees now is 11 - 4 + 3 = 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 children in total. 2 have left and 1 is still present. So, the number of children who have left is 2. Now, let's find out how many more children are coming. We are told that there will be 4 more children. Therefore, the total number of children after all the new ones arrive would be:  3 (present) + 4 (new) = 7.  So, there will be 7 children in total after all the new ones arrive.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after 9 people left, there were 12 people left in the company. So, if we subtract 9 from 12, we get:  12 - 9 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 new employees who started working at the company.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 employees in total and 5 have left. So, the number of remaining employees is:  14 - 5 = 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after some employees left, there were 13 - 4 = 9 employees left in the company. Now, if more employees have resigned, there will be fewer people left. So, if 4 new employees joined, there would be 9 + 4 = 13 employees left in total. Therefore, the number of employees who have resigned is 9 - 13 = 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 employees in the company and 15 new employees have joined. So, the total number of employees is:  12 + 15 = 27 employees. Now, we need to find out how many existing employees will be left after the new employees join. To do this, we subtract the number of new employees from the total number of employees:  27 - 15 = 12 employees. Therefore, there will be 12 existing employees left after the new employees join.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 existing employees (A, B, and C) before any new hires.  Next, we learn that after the company hired more people, there are now 8 employees in total (including A, B, C, and the newly hired ones). Finally, we are asked how many of the new hires were made. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of existing employees (3) from the total number of employees (8), which gives us:  8 - 3 = 5 New hires were made.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 8 employees in the company.  After some people left, there were only 5 employees left.  Then, the company hired new employees and now has a total of 99 employees. So, to find out how many new employees were hired, we need to subtract the original number of employees (5) from the current total number of employees (99).  5 - 99 = -94  Therefore, the company hired -94 new employees.
Response:  Firstly, after some people left, there were 12 people left in the team. Then, 14 more people joined the team, so now there are 12 + 14 = 26 people in the team. Finally, 10 more people left the team, leaving us with 26 - 10 = 16 people in the team. Therefore, there are 16 people in the team now.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Auntie spent $2 on each of her three children, so she spent a total of $6.  Next, we know that after spending $6, Auntie had $3 left over, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
$6 - $3 = $0  Simplifying the equation:  
$6 - $3 = $3  Solving for the unknown variable (in this case, the amount Auntie had left over):  
$3 = $3  Therefore, Auntie had $3 left over after spending $6 on her three children."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 4 dollars and she spends 3 dollars on toys for her children. So, how much money does Dan have left after buying toys?   To find out, we can subtract the amount of money spent (3 dollars) from the total amount of money available (4 dollars): 4 - 3 = 1 dollar. Therefore, Dan has 1 dollar left after buying toys.
Response:  First, we know that the cost of 100 grams of chicken is 3 dollars.  So, to calculate the total cost of 99 grams of chicken, we need to subtract 1 gram from 100 grams.  99 grams - 1 gram = 98 grams Therefore, the total cost of 99 grams of chicken is: 98 grams x 3 dollars/100 grams = 294 dollars Subtracting 294 dollars from 4 dollars (the original amount), we get: 4 dollars - 294 dollars = 290 dollars Therefore, the change will be 290 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of all three items is 3 x 4 = 12 dol-lars.  Next, we are told that each item costs 4 dol-lars, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  3x + 3(4) = 12  Now solve for x.  We have:  3x + 12 = 12  3x = 0  Therefore, x = 0.  So, the number of items purchased is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each doll is priced at 3 dollars. So if she buys two dolls, it will cost her 2 x 3 = 6 dollars in total. Now, if she wants to buy three dolls, it will cost her 3 x 3 = 9 dollars in total. Therefore, she needs to spend an additional 9 - 6 = 3 dollars more to buy three dolls instead of just two.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 7 dolla...
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent 4 dollars on toys and games for her children. Secondly, she bought a pair of shoes at 7 dollars each, so she paid 7 x 2 = 14 dollars for the shoes. Lastly, she used 6 dollars to buy chocolate and cookies. Therefore, in total, Dan spent 4 + 14 + 6 = 24 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of buying 1 kg of rice is 60 baht and the cost of buying 1 egg is 3 baht. So, if she bought 2 kg of rice, she would have spent 2 x 60 = 120 baht on rice. And if she bought 3 eggs, she would have spent 3 x 3 = 9 baht on eggs. Therefore, in total, she would have spent 120 + 9 = 139 baht.   However, she only paid 120 baht for the rice and eggs, so there must be some mistake or missing information. To find out where the mistake is, let's calculate the cost per unit of each item: For rice: Cost per kg = 60 baht / 2 kg = 30 baht/kg For eggs: Cost per egg = 3 baht / 3 eggs = 1 baht/egg Now, let's compare the cost per unit with the given price: Rice: Actual price = 30 baht/kg (from calculation) vs Expected price = 60 baht/kg (based on the problem) Eggs: Actual price = 1 baht/egg (from calculation) vs Expected price = 3 baht/egg (based on the problem) Based on this comparison, it seems that the actual prices are lower than the expected prices for both items. This suggests that there might be a discount or promotion for these items, which could explain why the girl only paid 120 baht instead of the expected 189 baht.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of buying a pair of shoes is 3 dollars.  Secondly, we know that the cost of buying a toy is 2 dollars.  Lastly, we know that the total amount spent by the child is 5 dollars.  So, if we subtract the cost of buying a toy from the total amount spent, we get:  5 dollars - 2 dollars = 3 dollars  Therefore, the child spent 3 dollars on buying a pair of shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 4 dollars and she spends 8 dollars to buy a toy. So, how much money does Dan have left?  4 dollars - 8 dollars =?  Yes, you are right! Dan has $0 left. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. If Dan's friend gives her 5 dollars, how much money will Dan have in total? 5 dollars + 0 dollars (what Dan already has) =?  Yes, you got it again! Dan will have $5 in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of the ring is 30% more than the original price. So if the original price was 100 baht, the cost of the ring would be:  100 x 1.3 = 130 baht. Now, we are asked to find out how much the ring would cost if the person had paid 400 baht at the beginning. To do this, we can set up an equation as follows:  130 = (400 - x) / 1.3 where x represents the amount paid at the beginning (in baht). Solving for x, we get:  130 = (400 - x) / 1.3 x = 400 / 1.3 x = 307.69 baht Therefore, the ring would have cost 307.69 baht if the person had paid 400 baht at the beginning.
Response:  First, we know that Dan has 4 dollars and spends 3 dollars on candies. So, how much money does Dan have left after buying candies? We can calculate this as follows: 4 - 3 = 1 dollar. Therefore, Dan has 1 dollar left after buying candies.
"Response:  First, we know that Dan has 3 dollars to spend in total. Second, each snack costs $1, so she can buy 3 snacks with her budget. Therefore, the total cost of all three snacks is 3 x $1 = $3.  
Now, let's say Dan wants to buy two more snacks. Since each snack still costs $1, the total cost of both additional snacks would be 2 x $1 = $2.  So, the grand total of all five snacks would be $3 + $2 = $5."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of the barber is 7 dollars.  Secondly, we know that the cost of the haircut is 3 dollars.  Therefore, the total cost of both services is 7 + 3 = 10 dollars.   Now, let's compare this to the amount of money that Dan spent on the two services. We know that he spent 5 dollars on the haircut and 3 dollars on the beard trim. So, in total, he spent 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  Since 8 dollars is less than 10 dollars, it means that Dan saved 2 dollars by getting the haircut and beard trim instead of just the haircut.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent 4 dollars on chocolate bars and 7 dollars on lollipops. So, in total, she spent $4 + $7 = $11 on candy. Next, we know that she bought 2 barrels of slime for $2 each, so she spent $2 x 2 = $4 on slime. Therefore, the total amount Dan spent is $11 + $4 = $15.  
Question: What if Dan had only bought one barrel of slime instead of two? Would her total cost be higher or lower than $15?  Answer: If Dan had only bought one barrel of slime, she would have spent $2 less, since each barrel costs $2. So, her new total cost would be $11 + $4 - $2 = $11 + $2 = $13. Therefore, if Dan had only bought one barrel of slime, her total cost would be lower than $15."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 115 pages in total and 78 pages have been sold. So, to find out how many pages are left unsold, we can subtract 78 from 115:  115 - 78 = 37 Therefore, there are 37 pages of comics left unsold in the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of books sold is 137. Next, we need to find out how many books were left unsold. To do this, we subtract the number of books sold from the total number of books available for sale. So, if there are 105 books available for sale and 137 books were sold, then the number of books left unsold would be:  105 - 137 = -32. Therefore, there are 32 books left unsold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the old price of the book was THB 108 per copy. Secondly, the seller gave away 35 copies to friends at a discounted price of THB 62 per copy. Finally, we want to find out how many more books were sold at the original price of THB 108 per copy. To do this, we can subtract the number of copies given away from the total number of books sold. So, let's calculate as follows: Total number of books sold = Number of copies given away + Number of books sold at THB 108 per copy Total number of books sold = 35 (at THB 62 per copy) + x (at THB 108 per copy) where x is the unknown number of books sold at THB 108 per copy. Now, we can substitute the values we have into the equation above: Total number of books sold = 35 (at THB 62 per copy) + x (at THB 108 per copy) 35 + x = 108 x - 62 x = 46 x = 72 Therefore, the seller sold an additional 72 books at the original price of THB 108 per copy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of books sold is 151 pages. Secondly, we know that each book has 50 pages. Therefore, to find out how many books were sold, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages in each book: 151 pages / 50 pages per book = 3 books. So, there are three books that were sold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of books sold is 150 volumes. Secondly, we are given that the old bookstore had 58 volumes of books. Therefore, to find out how many new books were sold, we can subtract the number of old books from the total number of books sold:  150 - 58 =?  The answer is 92 volumes. So, the new bookstore sold 92 new books.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the new book has 42 pages in total. Secondly, we are given that the old book had 15 pages sold out of its original 21 pages. Therefore, to calculate how many more pages the new book has than the old book, we need to subtract the number of pages sold from both books: New Book - Old Book = 42 - 15 = 27 pages. So, the new book has 27 more pages than the old book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in all three books is 116 pages.  Secondly, we know that the new book has 38 pages more than the old one. Therefore, to find out how many additional pages are in the new book, we can subtract the number of pages in the old book from the total number of pages in all three books:  116 - 71 = 45 pages.  So, the new book has 45 additional pages beyond what was sold before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the old price of the book was THB 108 per copy and there were 66 copies sold in total. Secondly, we know that the new price of the book is THB 55 per copy and there are 59 copies left after the sale. So, to find out how much money the seller made from the sale, we need to subtract the cost price (THB 55) from the revenue (THB 108 x 66 = THB 7,240). Therefore, the seller made THB 7,240 - THB 55 = THB 7,185 from the sale.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many copies of each book were sold based on the information given in the problem statement. For the first book, there are 51 pages and it was sold for THB 82. Therefore, the number of copies sold can be calculated as follows: Number of copies = Total revenue / Price per copy Number of copies = THB 82 x 106 / THB 82 Number of copies = 1060 copies For the second book, there are 106 pages and it was sold for THB 14. Therefore, the number of copies sold can be calculated as follows: Number of copies = Total revenue / Price per copy Number of copies = THB 14 x 14 / THB 14 Number of copies = 98 copies Now that we have the total number of copies sold for both books, we can calculate the total number of pages sold. To do this, we simply multiply the number of copies sold for each book by the number of pages in each book: Total number of pages sold = Number of copies x Number of pages per book Total number of pages sold = 1060 x 51 + 98 x 106 Total number of pages sold = 53,660 pages + 9,864 pages Total number of pages sold = 63,524 pages Finally, we can calculate the average price per page by dividing the total revenue by the total number of pages sold: Average price per page = Total revenue / Total number of pages sold Average price per page = THB 82 x 106 + THB 14 x 98 Average price per page = THB 8,200,000 + THB 1,376,000 Average price per page = THB 9,576,000 Total number of pages sold = 63,524 pages Average price per page = THB 9,576,000 / 63,524 pages = THB 150 per page
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of pages in the old book is 270 pages. Secondly, we know that the new book has 136 pages less than the old book. Therefore, to find out how many pages the new book has, we can subtract 136 from 270. So, the new book has 270 - 136 = 134 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol has 134 pages of books to sell. She gave 39 pages to her friend as a gift, leaving her with 95 pages (134 - 39 = 95). Next, she sold some books at a bookstore and was left with 68 pages (95 - 27 = 68), where 27 pages were sold at the bookstore. Therefore, the total number of pages of books that Pol has left is 68 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 95 books and 153 pages in total. Secondly, after selling 13 books and burning 23 pages, we have to find out how many pages are left. To do this, we need to subtract the number of books sold from the total number of pages. So, if we sell 13 books, we will have 95 - 13 = 82 books remaining. Now, let's calculate the number of pages left. We can do this by subtracting the number of pages burned (23) from the total number of pages. Therefore, the number of pages left is 82 x 153 = 12466 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many copies of the book and pamphlet were sold based on the information given in the problem statement. We know that there are 42 books and 143 pages in each book. Therefore, if we multiply 42 by 143, we get 6058 (books x pages per book). Now, let's move on to calculating the number of pamphlets sold. We know that there are 113 pages in each pamphlet, so if we multiply 113 by the number of pamphlets sold, we can find out how many pages were sold in total. Based on the problem statement, there are 19 more pamphlets than books, which means there are 19 x 113 = 2171 pages of pamphlets sold. Finally, we add up all these page counts to find out how many pages were sold in total: 6058 + 2171 = 8229 pages. So, the total number of pages sold is 8229 pages.
Response:  There are 10 flowers in the first bunch and 8 flowers in the second bunch, so there are 10 + 8 = 18 flowers in total.
Response:  There are 23 flowers in total.  If she gave 16 flowers to her friends and put 7 flowers in a vase, how many flowers did she give away?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of flowers she kept (7) from the total number of flowers (23).  So, she gave away 23 - 7 = 16 flowers.
Response:  There are 23 flowers in total.  If Jessica took 4 flowers from the bouquet and gave them to her friends, then she has 23 - 4 = 19 flowers left.  So, Jessica has 19 flowers left after giving 4 flowers away.
Response:  Firstly, she had 15 flowers in her garden before she gave some to her friends.  Next, she gave 33 flowers away, leaving her with 17 flowers left in her garden.  So, she has 17 - 15 = 2 more flowers now than she did before giving any away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 cherry blossoms in total.  Secondly, she gave 34 cherry blossoms to her friend.  Therefore, the number of cherry blossoms left for her is:  21 - 34 = 15.  So, she has 15 cherry blossoms left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 59 total flowers in the garden. Secondly, we know that 20 of those flowers have withered away. Therefore, to find out how many daisies are left, we can subtract 20 from 59: 59 - 20 =?  The answer is 39. So, there are 39 daisies left in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 flowers in total, and each flower has 12 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals is 13 x 12 = 156 petals. Now, we need to find out how many more petals will be added if we include all the flowers in the garden. To do this, we can add up the number of petals for each flower: 156 + 156 +... + 156 (for 13 flowers) = 1980 petals. So, there will be 1980 - 156 = 1824 additional petals if we include all the flowers in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 flowers in total (15 + 2). Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers are daisies and how many are sunflowers. We can start by looking at the number of daisies. There are 15 daisies in total (15 x 3 = 45 petals). Now, let's look at the number of sunflowers. There are 2 sunflowers with 62 petals each (2 x 62 = 124 petals). In total, there are 45 + 124 = 169 petals. Therefore, there are 169 petals in the bouquet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 flowers and 21 leaves in the bouquet.  If Jessica took away 2 leaves from each flower, she would have taken a total of 2 x 10 = 20 leaves.  Since there were originally 21 leaves, this means that Jessica has taken all the leaves except for one. Therefore, the number of leaves left is 21 - 20 = 1.  So, Jessica has taken 20 leaves and left only one leaf behind.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 flowers in total and 2 bunches of flowers in each jar. So, if we divide 12 by 2, we get 6 as our result. Therefore, there are 6 more flowers than bunches of flowers in the jars.
Response:  We know that there are 11 flowers in the bouquet and 20 flowers in total. So, we can start by subtracting the number of flowers in the bouquet from the total number of flowers to find out how many more flowers there are.  11 - 20 = -9 There is no whole number of flowers left after subtracting the number of flowers in the bouquet from the total number of flowers. Therefore, there are no more flowers.  However, if we want to be more precise, we can use decimals to represent the remaining flowers. Since there are 9 fewer flowers than the total number of flowers, we can say that there are approximately 0.45 (9/20) more flowers left over.
Response:  Firstly, she has 19 flowers in total. Secondly, she had 3 flowers at first. Therefore, if we subtract 3 from 19, we get:  19 - 3 = 16 So, she has 16 flowers left after giving 3 to her friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 flowers in the bouquet and 84 flowers in total. Secondly, we know that Jessica gave away 91 flowers after she took out 14 flowers from the bouquet. Therefore, to find out how many flowers Jessica gave away, we can subtract 14 from 91, which gives us 77. So, Jessica gave away 77 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 flowers in total, and Jessica has given 7 of them to her friends. So, the number of flowers left with Jessica is 16 - 7 = 9. Next, we know that Jessica has 13 daisies left. Therefore, the total number of flowers Jessica has is 9 + 13 = 22. Finally, we need to find out how many bouquets Jessica has given away. Since each bouquet contains 7 flowers, Jessica has given away 7 x 4 = 28 bouquets.
Response:  There are 21 flowers in the bouquet and 22 flowers in total (including the bouquet). So, there are 22 - 21 = 1 flower more than the bouquet. Therefore, the number of daisies in the additional bunch is 1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 flowers in total and 6 of them are in the first jar. Therefore, the number of flowers in the second jar is 9 - 6 = 3.   So, there are 3 more flowers in the second jar than in the first jar.
Response:  If Robin is 17 years old and her height is reduced by 4 inches (13 - 17 = -4), then she would be:  17 - 4 = 13 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of her hair before cutting was 20 inches (50 cm). Secondly, after cutting, her hair became 10 inches (25 cm) shorter. Therefore, the length of her hair now is:  20 - 10 = 10 inches (25 cm).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin had 16 inches of hair and she cut off 11 inches. So, how many inches of hair does Robin have left now?  16 - 11 = 5 inches. Therefore, Robin has 5 inches of hair left.
Response:  If Robin is currently 19 years old and will be 18 years old after 1 year, we can calculate her age as follows:  19 - 1 = 18 So, Robin will be 18 years old after 1 year.
Response:  If her waist is 13 inches and she wants to wear a skirt that fits perfectly, we can assume that she wants the skirt to be snug but not too tight. So, let's add 2-3 inches to her waist size for comfort. Therefore, her ideal skirt waist size would be around 15-16 inches (13 + 2-3).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's height increased by 8 inches (20 cm). So, her new height is:  

Robin's original height + 8 inches = 14 inches + 8 inches = 22 inches (56 cm) 

Therefore, Robin's current height is 22 inches (56 cm)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 12 facial expressions in total. Secondly, he has 53 additional facial expressions that are not part of his standard set. Therefore, if we add 12 and 53 together, we get:  12 + 53 = 65. So, Dan has a total of 65 facial expressions.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 flowers in the first bunch and each bunch has 53 flowers. Therefore, to find out how many more flowers there are in the second bunch, we need to subtract the number of flowers in the first bunch from the total number of flowers in the second bunch. So, if we subtract 21 from 53, we get:  53 - 21 = 32.  There are 32 more flowers in the second bunch than in the first bunch.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 63 old coins in total. Secondly, he has 51 new coins. Thirdly, he has 33 coins in his piggy bank. So, if we subtract the number of new coins from the total number of coins, we get:  63 - 51 = 12  Then, if we subtract the number of coins in the piggy bank from the remaining coins, we get:  12 - 33 = -21 Therefore, Dan has 21 fewer coins than he had before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 facial expressions in total. Secondly, we know that Dan has 35 old facial expressions. Therefore, the number of new facial expressions that Dan discovers is:  36 - 35 = 1. So, Dan discovers one new facial expression.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the old man has been living in the same house for 63 years, which means he is now 63 + 30 = 93 years old. Secondly, we know that he has been experiencing joint pain for the past 30 years, which means he started feeling it when he was 63 - 30 = 33 years old. Finally, we are told that his joint pain has been getting worse over time, so let's assume that the frequency and severity of the pain have increased linearly with his age. Therefore, if the old man is currently experiencing joint pain every 30 minutes, at the age of 93, he would have experienced approximately  93 x (30/63) = 157 episodes of joint pain per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 28 flowers in total and 63 stems. Next, we need to find out how many bunches of flowers he has. To do this, we can divide the number of flowers by the number of stems per bunch (which is given as 8). So, we have:  28 / 8 = 3 bunches of flowers. Therefore, Dan has 3 bunches of flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 coconuts in the first bunch and 30 coconuts in the second bunch.  Therefore, the total number of coconuts is 22 + 30 = 52 coconuts.   Next, we know that there are 17 coconuts in the third bunch and 57 coconuts in the fourth bunch. So, the total number of coconuts in the third and fourth bunches is 17 + 57 = 74 coconuts.  Finally, we add up all the numbers to get the total number of coconuts in the five bunches: 52 + 74 = 126 coconuts.  There are 126 coconuts in the five bunches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 30 coins in total and spends 14 coins on sweets. So, he has 30 - 14 = 16 coins left. Next, we know that Dan has 7 coins in his piggy bank and 86 coins in his savings box. Therefore, the difference between the number of coins in his piggy bank and the number of coins in his savings box is:  7 (piggy bank) - 86 (savings box) = -79 coins.  Since the answer must be positive, we can conclude that there are more coins in his savings box than in his piggy bank. The correct answer is:  86 coins.
Response:  First, we know that Dan has 68 flowers in her garden and 51 stones. Next, we need to find out how many more flowers she has than stones. To do this, we can subtract the number of stones from the total number of flowers:  68 - 51 = 17  So, Dan has 17 more flowers than stones in her garden. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. We are asked to find out how many more stones she has than flowers in the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of flowers from the total number of stones:  51 - 11 = 40  Therefore, Dan has 40 more stones than flowers in the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 71 coins in total and he spends 24 coins on sweets. So, how many coins does Dan have left?  24 + 71 = 95 coins. Therefore, Dan has 95 - 24 = 71 coins left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 boxes of chocolates and each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, in total, there are 10 x 6 = 60 pieces of chocolate. Now, let's consider the number of strawberries. We know that there are 62 strawberries in all, but some of them may be shared among the chocolate boxes. So, let's divide 62 by the number of chocolate boxes to find out how many strawberries are left for each box. There are 62 / 10 = 6.2 strawberries per box on average. Since each box has 6 pieces of chocolate, we can round up the number of strawberries per box to the nearest whole number, which is 7 strawberries per box. Finally, we need to calculate the total number of strawberries that are not accounted for in the chocolate boxes. To do this, we subtract the number of strawberries per box from the total number of strawberries: 62 - (10 x 7) = 62 - 70 = 52 strawberries remain unaccounted for. Therefore, there are 52 strawberries that are not accounted for in the chocolate boxes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 25 baht in her wallet and she spends it all at the amusement park. So, the amount of money she spent at the amusement park is 25 baht.   Secondly, we know that after spending the money at the amusement park, Dan has no more money left in her wallet. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her wallet is zero (0).  Finally, we are asked how much money Dan had before she went to the amusement park. Since she had no money left in her wallet after spending the money at the amusement park, we can conclude that she did not have any money before going to the amusement park either.  Therefore, the answer to the question ""How much money did Dan have before going to the amusement park?"" is zero (0) baht."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 32 teeth in total. Secondly, he had 25 teeth before. So, to find out how many more teeth he has now, we subtract 25 from 32:  32 - 25 = 7 Therefore, Danny has 7 more teeth now than he did before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 67 fever at the moment and he has been taking medicine for 3 days. So, if we subtract 3 from 67, we get 64 (67 - 3 = 64). Now, we need to find out how many more fever Dan will have after 2 more days of taking medicine. To do this, we can add 2 to 64, which gives us 66 (64 + 2 = 66). Therefore, Dan will have 66 fever after 2 more days of taking medicine.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 60 stomachaches in total, and he has taken 50 of them to the park. So, how many stomachaches does Dan have left? We can calculate this by subtracting 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10. Therefore, Dan has 10 stomachaches left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 54 flowers in total and he met 48 new flowers at the park. So, how many more flowers did Dan have than the ones he met at the park? To find out, subtract the number of new flowers from the total number of flowers:  54 - 48 = 6  Therefore, Dan had 6 more flowers than the ones he met at the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 42 fever and 61 coughing symptoms in total. Next, we need to find out how many of these symptoms are due to the flu. To do this, we subtract the number of symptoms that are not due to the flu from the total number of symptoms. In this case, we have 29 symptoms that are not due to the flu (82 - 53 = 29). Therefore, Dan has 42 - 29 = 13 symptoms due to the flu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 66 soongs (thai units of length) in one khlong (Thai unit of length), and there are 39 soongs in one nai (Thai unit of length). Therefore, to find out how many soongs are in 16 khlongs, we can multiply 66 by 16, which gives us:  66 x 16 = 1056 soongs  Next, we need to convert these soongs into nai. We know that there are 39 soongs in one nai, so we can divide 1056 by 39, which gives us:  1056 / 39 = 27 nai  So, there are 27 nai in 16 khlongs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 21 fever and 52 coughing episodes in total. Next, we need to find out how many times he has coughed more than his fever. To do this, we can subtract the number of fever from the number of coughing episodes. So, if we subtract 21 (fever) from 52 (coughing episodes), we get:  52 - 21 = 31 This means that Dan has coughed 31 times more than his fever. Therefore, the answer is 31.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 31 baht in his wallet and he spends 9 baht on snacks at the convenience store. So, how much money does Dan have left after buying snacks?  9 baht - 31 baht =?  Baht  Left After Buying Snacks  Answer: 22 baht.  Now, let's find out how many snacks Dan can buy with 22 baht. We know that each snack costs 5 baht, so how many snacks can Dan buy?  22 baht / 5 baht =? Number of Snacks  Answer: 4 snacks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 58 coins in total and he spent 25 coins on sweets. So, how many coins does Dan have left?  25 + 58 = 83 coins. Therefore, Dan has 83 - 25 = 58 coins left. Next, we know that Dan used 12 coins to buy sticks. So, how many coins does Dan have left now? 58 - 12 = 46 coins. Finally, we can see that Dan has 46 coins left after buying sticks and sweets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 15 socks and 18 underwear in his drawer. Secondly, he has 67 socks and 35 pairs of underwear in total. Now, let's calculate how many more socks than underwear does Dan have. To do this, subtract the number of underwear from the total number of socks:  67 - 35 = 32 So, Dan has 32 more socks than underwear.
Response:  If J has 11 children and each child has 17 children, then J has a total of 11 x 17 = 187 grandchildren.   Therefore, if S has 17 children and each child has 11 children, then S has a total of 17 x 11 = 187 grandchildren as well.  So, both J and S have the same number of grandchildren, which is 187.
Response:  If Jill has 15 children and each child has 2 pets, then Jill will have a total of 15 x 2 = 30 pets.   Therefore, Jill will have 30 pets in all (not more than 15).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jill has more children than Steve. So, if Steve has 19 children, Jill must have at least 20 children. Secondly, we know that Jill has fewer children than 30. Therefore, Jill can have only up to 29 children. Now, let's add up the number of children both Steve and Jill have:  19 + 29 = 48 children in total.  So, there are 48 children in total - 19 for Steve and 29 for Jill.
Response:  If Jill has 5 children and each child has more than 2 pets, then the total number of pets owned by Jill's family is at least 5 x 3 = 15 pets. However, we are told that Jill has more pets than her neighbor, who has 8 pets. Therefore, the number of pets owned by Jill must be greater than 8. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  If Jill has 4 children and each child has more than 3 pets, then the total number of pets owned by Jill's family is at least 4 x 3 = 12 pets. However, we are given that Jill has more pets than her neighbor, so the actual number of pets owned by Jill must be greater than 12. Therefore, the numeric answer is:  13 (since Jill has 13 pets).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jill has 7 children and each child has more than 2 pets. So, if we assume that each child has exactly 2 pets, then Jill will have 7 x 2 = 14 pets in total. However, the problem states that Jill has more than 14 pets. Therefore, we can conclude that each child must have more than 2 pets. Let's say each child has x pets, where x is a positive integer greater than 2. Then, the number of pets Jill has can be calculated as follows:  7 x (x + 2) = 7 x 3 = 21 pets.  Since the problem states that Jill has more than 14 pets, we can conclude that x > 2. Therefore, the number of pets Jill has is at least 21.  But wait! We can do better. If Jill has 9 children, then she will have 9 x 2 = 18 pets in total. This is still less than 21 pets. So, we can conclude that Jill has exactly 9 children and each child has exactly 2 pets, which means she has a total of 18 pets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that เจคมี (Jek) has 7 children and จิล (Gil) has 8 children. So, together they have 7 + 8 = 15 children.   Next, we are told that เจคมี has more grandchildren than Jil. This means that the total number of grandchildren for both families is greater than 15. Specifically, เจคมี has more than 15 - 8 = 7 grandchildren. Therefore, the total number of grandchildren for both families is 7 + 15 = 22.  Finally, we are asked how many great-grandchildren do เจคมี and Jil have in common. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of grandchildren they have in common from the total number of great-grandchildren for each family. For เจคมี, the number of great-grandchildren in common is 7 - 7 = 0, since all of their grandchildren are also her great-grandchildren. For Jil, the number of great-grandchildren in common is 8 - 7 = 1, since one of his grandchildren is not also a great-grandchild of เจคมี. Therefore, the total number of great-grandchildren that เจคมี and Jil have in common is 0 + 1 = 1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 9 cats and more than 18 cats in total. So, if we subtract 9 from 18, we get 9 - 9 = 0. Therefore, Satie has no dogs.   However, this is not what the question asks for. The question asks for how many dogs Satie has, not how many cats she has. To find out how many dogs Satie has, we need to look at the information given in the question again. It says that Satie has more than 18 cats. This means that Satie must have at least one dog because there are only 9 cats. So, the answer is 1 dog.
Response:  If Jil has 5 children and each child has 3 pets, then Jil has a total of 5 x 3 = 15 pets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jill has 18 pets and each pet has an average of 87 puppies. So, in total, Jill has 18 x 87 = 1569 puppies.   Therefore, Jack has more than 1569 puppies because he has 18 pets with an average of 87 puppies per pet, just like Jill.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jill has 16 friends in total.  Secondly, we know that Jack has more than 12 friends because he is playing with his friends and not studying like Jill. Therefore, Jack must have at least 13 friends to play with. Now let's add up all the friends of both Jill and Jack: Jill - 16 friends + Jack - 13 friends = Total number of friends = 16 + 13 = 29 friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 12 friends and each friend has an average of 79 friends. So, the total number of friends of all 12 friends is 12 x 79 = 948. Now, let's find out how many of these friends are popular (have more than 100 friends). We know that Satie has 19 popular friends and each popular friend has an average of 14 non-popular friends. Therefore, the total number of popular friends is 19 x 14 = 266. Finally, to find out how many non-popular friends Satie has, we subtract the number of popular friends from the total number of friends: 948 - 266 = 682. So, Satie has 682 non-popular friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 13 friends and each friend gives her 3 gifts on average. So, the total number of gifts Satie receives is 13 x 3 = 39 gifts. Next, we know that Satie has 9 close friends who give her 8 gifts each on average. Therefore, the total number of gifts from her close friends is 9 x 8 = 72 gifts. Lastly, we need to find out how many gifts are left after subtracting the gifts from her close friends from the total number of gifts she received. To do this, we can subtract 72 from 39, which gives us 39 - 72 = -33. Since there cannot be negative gifts, we know that there are no leftover gifts. Hence, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 6 children and each child has an average of 16 friends. So, the total number of friends for all 6 children is:  6 x 16 = 96 friends Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We know that Satie has 8 more children, and each child has an average of 17 friends. So, the total number of friends for these 8 children is:  8 x 17 = 136 friends Therefore, the total number of friends for all 14 children (6 + 8) is:  96 + 136 = 232 friends
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 3 children and each child has an average of 15 friends. So, the total number of friends for all three children is 3 x 15 = 45 friends. Next, we need to find out how many of these friends are boys. We know that Satie has 12 boys and 15 girls in her family. Therefore, the number of boy friends is 12/15 x 45 = 60 boys. Finally, we can calculate the ratio of boys to girls among Satie's children's friends as follows: 60 boys / (45 + 60) = 60 boys / 105 = 1/1.5 or approximately 2/3. So, two-thirds of Satie's children's friends are boys.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 12 children and each child has an average of 4-5 friends. So, the total number of friends of all 12 children is: 12 x 4 = 48 friends. Now, let's calculate how many of those friends are from the same family as Satie. We know that Satie has 67 grandchildren, so the number of her grandchildren who are also her children's friends (i.e., the ones who come from the same family) can be calculated as follows: 67 / 4 = 16.75 (round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, there are 17 of Satie's grandchildren who are also her children's friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 18 cats and each cat has an average of 4 kittens. So, in total, Satie has 18 x 4 = 72 kittens. Now, let's consider Jil's cats. We know that Jil has fewer cats than Satie, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's assume that Jil has x cats, where x is a positive integer less than 18 (since Jil has fewer cats than Satie). Since each cat has an average of 4 kittens, Jil has x x 4 = 4x kittens in total. Finally, we can compare the number of kittens between Satie and Jil by comparing 72 with 4x. Based on this comparison, we can determine which value of x makes sense given the information provided. Can you figure out what x might be?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 19 children and each child has more than one pet chicken. Secondly, we are told that Satie has fewer children than Jil, who has 72 children. Finally, we want to find out how many children Jil has. So let's start with what we know first. We can begin by writing down the information given in the problem as follows: 19 (Satie) < 72 (Jil) Since Satie has fewer children than Jil, we can write an inequality statement based on this information. 19 < 72 Now we need to find out how many children Jil has. To do this, we will divide both sides of the inequality statement by 19, which gives us: 72 / 19 = x + 19 x = 72 x = 4 Therefore, Jil has 4 times as many children as Satie does. This means that Jil has 4 x 19 = 76 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 14 children and among them are six boys and three girls. So, the number of boys is 6 and the number of girls is 3. Now, let's count the total number of children Satie has: 6 + 3 = 9. Therefore, Satie has nine children in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 84 children and 10 grandchildren. Therefore, the total number of descendants is 84 + 10 = 94 people. Next, we are told that Satien has 13 great-grandchildren. So, the total number of descendants including great-grandchildren is 94 + 13 = 107 people. Finally, we are asked how many great-grandchildren does Satien have? To find this out, we need to divide the total number of descendants (107) by the number of children she has (84), which gives us:  107 / 84 = 13 Great-grandchildren.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 13 kids and each kid has 8 pets, so the total number of pets is:  13 x 8 = 104 pets. Next, we know that Jake also has 17 grandkids and each grandkid has 12 pets, so the total number of pets from his grandkids is:  17 x 12 = 204 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets owned by Jake is the sum of these two numbers: 104 + 204 = 308 pets. So, Jake owns 308 pets in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that สตีเวน (Satien) has 8 children and each child has more than 10 children. So, Satien's grandchildren are at least 8 x 10 = 80.   Secondly, we know that พีช (Pich) has 18 children. Therefore, Pich's grandchildren are at least 18 x 10 = 180. Now, let's add up all the grandchildren of Satien and Pich: 80 + 180 = 260. So, the total number of grandchildren is 260.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Satie has 3 children and Pichai has 15 children.  So, if we add the number of children of both families, we get:  3 + 15 = 18  Next, we need to find out how many grandchildren do they have in total. We know that Satie has 4 grandchildren and Pichai has 19 grandchildren. Therefore, the total number of grandchildren is:  4 + 19 = 23  Now, let's compare the total number of grandchildren with the total number of children. We can see that the total number of grandchildren (23) is more than the total number of children (18).  So, the correct answer is:  More grandchildren than children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olive has 78 dollars in her purse and she spends 15 dollars at the restaurant. So, how much money does Olive have left after spending 15 dollars?   To find out, we can subtract 15 from 78: 78 - 15 =?  The result is: 63 dollars. Therefore, Olive has 63 dollars left after spending 15 dollars at the restaurant.
Response:  Firstly, we know that she has 78 dollars in her supermarket money box. If she spends 33 dollars, how much does she have left?   To find out, we can subtract 33 from 78: 78 - 33 =?  The result is: 45 dollars. So, after spending 33 dollars, she has 45 dollars left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olive received $100 from Emily and then she spent $148 more. So, in total, Olive has spent $248. Now, let's check how much money Olive has left after spending $248. We can do this by subtracting $248 from her original amount of $100. Therefore, Olive has $100 - $248 = -$148 left. 
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olive has $300 in her purse before she went to the restaurant.  After she spent $150 at the restaurant, she had $300 - $150 = $150 left in her purse.   Next, we know that she received an additional $49 from Emily after she came back from the restaurant. So, the total amount of money Olive had after receiving the $49 was $150 + $49 = $200.  Therefore, the answer is $200.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olive received $91 from her employer after working for them for 1 month.  Secondly, she spent $14 on transportation to go to the supplier meeting.  So, how much money does Olive have left after spending $14 on transportation?   To find out, we can subtract $14 from $91:  $91 - $14 =?  Can you do this subtraction and tell me the result?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olive spent $49 at the supermarket and she has $26 left after spending that money. So, if we subtract $49 from $26, we get:   $26 - $49 = -$23  This means that Olive has $23 less than what she had before she went shopping.  Next, we need to find out how much she spent at the mall. We know that she spent $49 at the supermarket, so let's assume that she spent half of that amount at the mall. Therefore, the amount she spent at the mall is:   $49 / 2 = $24.50  Now, let's add up all the amounts that Olive spent:  $24.50 + (-$23) = $24.50 - $23 = $21.50  So, in total, Olive spent $21.50 at both places.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oli has 29 dollars in her wallet and she spends 54 dollars at the store. So, how much money does Oli have left after shopping? To find out, we can subtract the amount she spent from the amount she had:  29 - 54 =?  Can you solve for the missing number?
Response:  Firstly, we know that she has 38 dollars in her supermarket money box.  If she spends all of it, she will have zero dollars left.   Secondly, if she starts with 128 dollars and spends 38 dollars, how much will she have left? To find out, subtract 38 from 128: 128 - 38 =?  The result is: 90 dollars. So, if she starts with 128 dollars and spends 38 dollars, she will have 90 dollars left.
Response:  If she has 19 apps and deletes 5 of them, then she will have 14 apps left (19 - 5 = 14).
Response:  Firstly, we know that after 18 apps were uninstalled, there were only 5 apps left on the phone. So, if we subtract 18 from 5, we get: 5 - 18 = -13. Therefore, the number of apps remaining on the phone is negative 13.
Response:  Firstly, she had 10 apps on her phone before deleting some of them. So, if we subtract the number of apps she deleted (4) from the total number of apps she had (10), we get: 10 - 4 = 6. Therefore, after deleting some of her apps, she was left with 6 apps on her phone.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps, there were 24 apps left. Now, if we add 89 new apps, how many apps will be in total?   Total number of apps = Number of remaining apps + Number of newly added apps  Total number of apps = 24 + 89  Total number of apps = 113 Therefore, there will be 113 apps in total after adding 89 new apps to the existing 24 apps.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the person had 15 apps on their phone before they deleted some of them. Then, they added 71 new apps, which means they have a total of 86 apps (15 + 71) now. Finally, they deleted 14 apps, leaving them with 72 apps (86 - 14). So, the number of apps the person has after deleting 14 apps is 72.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps and files, there were 5 apps and 23 files left on the phone.  Before deleting those apps and files, there were 16 apps and 77 files in total. Therefore, to find out how many apps were deleted, we can subtract the number of apps after deletion (5) from the number of apps before deletion (16):  16 - 5 = 11 apps were deleted. Similarly, to find out how many files were deleted, we can subtract the number of files after deletion (23) from the number of files before deletion (77):  77 - 23 = 54 files were deleted.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting apps and files, there are only three apps left (App 3, App 7, and File 7). So, if we subtract the number of apps before deletion from the total number of apps, we get:  
Total number of apps before deletion = 17 + 21 = 38 apps  
Number of apps left after deletion = 3 + 7 = 10 apps  
Therefore, the difference between the total number of apps before and after deletion is:  
Difference = Total number of apps before deletion - Number of apps left after deletion = 38 - 10 = 28 apps  
So, the user deleted 28 apps."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps and files, there were only 21 apps and 4 files left on the phone.  So, to find out how many more apps are installed compared to files, we need to subtract the number of files from the total number of apps.  

Total number of apps = 21 + 4 = 25 apps  Total number of files = 4 files  Therefore, the difference between the number of apps and the number of files is:  

Difference = Total number of apps - Total number of files = 25 - 4 = 21 apps more than files This means that there are 21 more apps installed on the phone than files."
Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps and files, there are still 6 apps and 15 files left on the phone.  Secondly, we know that before deleting anything, there were 19 apps and 18 files on the phone.  Now, let's subtract the number of apps and files before deletion from the number of apps and files after deletion to find out how many more apps and files are left on the phone.   Apps: 19 - 6 = 13 (more apps left) Files: 18 - 15 = 3 (more files left) Therefore, there are 13 more apps and 3 more files left on the phone than before deletion.
Response:  Firstly, we know that A has 17 apps and B has 18 apps. So, if A adds some more apps, we can say that A has x + 17 apps, where x is the number of additional apps added by A. Similarly, B has 18 apps. Now, let's compare the two statements:   x + 17 = 18  We can solve for x by subtracting 17 from both sides:  x = 18 - 17  x = 1  Therefore, A has 1 app more than B.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps and files, there were 15 remaining apps and 30 files.  Next, we know that 12 apps and 29 files were deleted. So, to find out how many apps were left after deletion, we need to subtract the number of apps that were deleted from the original number of apps. In this case, 15 - 12 = 3 apps were left after deletion. Similarly, to find out how many files were left after deletion, we need to subtract the number of files that were deleted from the original number of files. In this case, 30 - 29 = 1 file was left after deletion. Therefore, the final answers are:  3 apps were left after deletion.  1 file was left after deletion.
Response:  Firstly, she had 24 files and 13 apps on her phone before deleting some of them. After deleting some apps and files, she was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So, in total, she deleted (24 - 13) = 11 files and (13 - 17) = 6 apps. Therefore, the number of files she deleted is 11, and the number of apps she deleted is 6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps and files, the phone has 5 GB of free space left.  Secondly, we are given that the user has 12 apps installed on their phone.  Now, let's calculate how much storage each app takes up.  We can assume that each app takes up approximately 1 GB of storage space (this is just an estimate).   Therefore, if there are 12 apps installed, then the total storage used by all the apps would be:  12 x 1 GB = 12 GB  So, the total amount of storage used by all the apps is 12 GB.  Finally, we need to subtract the amount of free space left (5 GB) from the total storage used by all the apps to find out how much storage each app takes up individually:  12 GB - 5 GB = 7 GB  Therefore, each app takes up approximately 7 GB of storage space on the phone.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after deleting some apps and files from her phone, she had 24 apps and 2 files left.  Secondly, we know that she had 11 apps and 3 files before deleting them.  Therefore, to find out how many more files she has now than before deleting the apps and files, we need to subtract the number of files she had before deleting them from the number of files she has now.   So, let's do that:  24 - 3 = 21  Now, we can see that she has 21 files more now than before deleting the apps and files.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neal has 242 cards in total and she gave 136 cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Neal is:  242 - 136 = 106 cards.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Neil has 528 cards in total and he gives 11 cards to Jeff. So, how many cards does Neil have left after giving 11 cards to Jeff? To find out, we can subtract 11 from 528.  528 - 11 =?  Yes, you are right! Neil has 517 cards left after giving 11 cards to Jeff. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. We know that Neil gives some of his remaining cards to Jeff. The question asks us to determine how many cards Neil gives to Jeff. Based on the information given, we know that Neil gives 252 cards to Jeff. Therefore, the final answer is: Neil gives 252 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Firstly, we know that J has 566 cards in total and gives 234 cards to E. So, J has  566 - 234 = 332 cards left. Now, we need to find out how many cards J has given to E. We can do this by dividing the number of cards J has given to E by the total number of cards J has. In other words, we can divide 234 by 566. Can you tell me what the result is?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Thanom has 309 red cards and 10 blue cards. So, if she gives some of her red cards to Ben, she will have fewer red cards left.  Secondly, we know that Thanom gave Ben  356 blue cards. Therefore, after giving the cards to Ben, Thanom will have  309 - 356 = 47 fewer red cards.  Finally, we know that Thanom has 10 green cards. So, in total, Thanom has 47 + 10 = 57 fewer cards than before.  To find out how many more green cards Thanom has than blue cards, we need to subtract the number of blue cards from the total number of cards she has:  57 - 356 = 299.  Therefore, Thanom has 299 green cards more than blue cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tham has 246 sheets of A4 paper and she gives some to her friends. So, let's subtract the number of sheets given away from the total number of sheets she had:  246 - 10 = 236 sheets of A4 paper left with Tham. Next, we know that Tham has 10 packets of 214 sheets each, so let's calculate how many more sheets she needs to buy:  236 - (10 x 214) = 236 - 2140 = 180 sheets need to be bought. Therefore, Tham needs to buy 180 sheets of A4 paper in addition to the 236 sheets she already has.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 573 cards in total and 195 of them were given to J. Now, we need to find out how many cards J has left after giving 195 cards away. To do this, we subtract 195 from 573:  573 - 195 = 378 So, J has 378 cards left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tham has 10 sets of 55 cards each, which is equal to 10 x 55 = 550 cards in total.  Next, we are given that she has 178 additional cards, so the total number of cards Tham has is 550 + 178 = 728 cards.  Therefore, the answer is 728 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tham has 239 cards in total and she gave away 10 cards to her friends. So, the number of cards left with Tham is 239 - 10 = 229. Next, we are told that Tham has 10 sets of 38 cards each. Therefore, the total number of cards in each set is 38 x 10 = 380. Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Tham has after giving away some cards from each set. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards given away from each set from the total number of cards in each set. In other words, we need to subtract 38 x 10 = 380 from 229. Here's the calculation: 229 - 380 = -151. Since the result is negative, it means that Tham does not have enough cards to give away. She only has 111 cards left (229 - 151). Therefore, the correct answer is 111.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many chocolates are in each box. We know that there are 19 pieces of candy in one box and 35 pieces in another box. So, if we want to find out how many boxes of each type we need to buy, we can start by dividing the total number of candies we want to buy by the number of candies in each box. For example, if we want to buy 200 candies in total, we can divide 200 by 19 (the number of candies in one box) to get 10 boxes of the first type. Similarly, we can divide 200 by 35 (the number of candies in the second box) to get 6 boxes of the second type. Therefore, the answer is 10 + 6 = 16 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pook has eaten 28 pages of her book so far. Secondly, she has 7 pages left to eat. Now, let's calculate how many more pages Pook needs to eat in total. Total number of pages = 28 + 7 = 35 pages. Therefore, Pook needs to eat 35 pages in total.
Response:  First, we know that Paw has eaten 2 chicken pieces and bought 37 more. So, how many chicken pieces does Paw have in total? To find out, let's add 2 + 37 = 39 chicken pieces. Therefore, Paw has 39 chicken pieces in total.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Paw has eaten 12 pieces of candy and given 21 pieces to her friends. So, in total, she has consumed 12 + 21 = 33 pieces of candy.   Next, we need to find out how many more pieces of candy Paw needs to eat to reach 16 pieces. To do this, we subtract the number of candies she has already eaten (33) from the desired amount (16): 33 - 16 = 17. Therefore, Paw needs to eat 17 more pieces of candy to reach 16 pieces.
Response:  First, we know that Paw has eaten 15 chicken wings and 54 meatballs. So, in total, she has eaten 79 pieces of food (15 + 54 = 79). Now, let's check how many chicken wings she has left to eat. We know that there are 22 chicken wings in total, and Paw has already eaten 15 of them. Therefore, she has 7 chicken wings left to eat (22 - 15 = 7). Finally, we can calculate how many meatballs she has left to eat. She has eaten 54 meatballs out of 75, so she has 21 meatballs left to eat (75 - 54 = 21).
Response:  First, we know that Paw has eaten 36 chicken wings and 3 chicken drumsticks. Next, let's calculate how many chicken wings she has left to eat. We can do this by subtracting the number of drumsticks she ate (3) from the total number of wings she had (36). So, Paw has 36 - 3 = 33 chicken wings left to eat.
Response:  First, we know that Pook has eaten 5 chicken wings and 2 drumsticks. So far, she has consumed a total of 5 + 2 = 7 pieces of chicken. Next, we need to find out how many more pieces of chicken Pook needs to eat to reach her goal of 37 pieces. To do this, we subtract the number of pieces she has already eaten (7) from her goal (37): 37 - 7 = 30. Therefore, Pook needs to eat an additional 30 pieces of chicken to reach her target. However, since she only has 11 drumsticks left, she cannot reach her goal. She is short by 19 pieces of chicken (30 - 11 = 19).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of chicken wings eaten is 20 + 34 = 54 chicken wings. Secondly, we know that the number of spicy chicken wings eaten is 8 x 2 = 16 chicken wings. Finally, we can calculate the difference between the two numbers to find out how many mild chicken wings were eaten: 54 - 16 = 38 chicken wings. Therefore, the boy ate 38 mild chicken wings.
Response:  If Pao has 36 pieces of candy and starts eating them one by one, he will have 0 pieces left when he finishes eating all 36. So, Pao will not have any candy left if he starts eating them from 36. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paw has 36 chicken pieces in total. Secondly, she gave 14 chicken pieces to her friends and ate 10 herself. So, how many chicken pieces does Paw have left? We can use subtraction to find out.  36 - 14 =? (Subtracting 14 from 36)  36 - 14 = 22 (Answer: 22) Therefore, Paw has 22 chicken pieces left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pim gave 41 pieces of candy to her friends. Secondly, she kept 9 pieces for herself and gave the remaining 32 pieces (41 - 9 = 32) to her other friends. Finally, she ate 18 pieces of candy. So, the total number of candies eaten by Pim is 18 + 32 = 50 pieces. Therefore, the answer is 50.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pook has eaten 23 pieces of candy. Secondly, she gave 30 pieces to her friends. So, if we subtract the number of candies she ate from the total number of candies she had, we get:  30 - 23 = 7  Therefore, Pook has given her friends 7 pieces of candy.
Response:  First, we know that Paw has eaten 15 chicken wings and 56 chicken drumsticks. So, in total, she has eaten 71 pieces of chicken (15 + 56). Now, let's calculate how many chicken wings and drumsticks are left. We know that there are 97 chicken wings and 34 drumsticks in total. Subtracting the number of pieces Paw has eaten from the total number of pieces, we get: Chicken wings: 97 - 15 = 82 chicken wings left Drumsticks: 34 - 56 = 0 drumsticks left (Paw has eaten all the drumsticks) Therefore, there are 82 chicken wings and 0 drumsticks left for Paw to eat.
Response:  First, we know that Paw has eaten 14 chicken wings and 9 drumsticks. So, let's calculate how many pieces of chicken she has left to eat.  14 + 9 = 23 pieces of chicken left for Paw to eat.  Therefore, Paw has 23 - 9 = 14 chicken wings and 23 - 14 = 9 drumsticks left to eat.
Response:  First, we know that Pook has eaten 32 chicken wings and 23 pieces of fried chicken. So far, he has consumed a total of 55 pieces of food. Next, we need to find out how many more pieces of fried chicken Pook needs to eat to reach 60 pieces. To do this, we subtract the number of chicken wings he has already eaten (32) from the desired amount (60): 60 - 32 = 28. Therefore, Pook needs to eat an additional 28 pieces of fried chicken to reach his goal.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pawom has eaten 28 chicken pieces and 15 fish pieces. So, in total, she has eaten 28 + 15 = 43 pieces of food. Secondly, we are given that she has not eaten any shrimp or squid. Therefore, the number of shrimp and squid pieces left is equal to the total number of shrimp and squid pieces minus the number of shrimp and squid pieces that Pawom has eaten. In this case, there are 40 shrimp pieces and 25 squid pieces, so the total number of shrimp and squid pieces left is 40 + 25 = 65 pieces. Finally, we can find out how many more shrimp and squid pieces Pawom needs to eat by subtracting the number of shrimp and squid pieces she has already eaten (0) from the total number of shrimp and squid pieces left (65): 65 - 0 = 65 pieces. Therefore, Pawom needs to eat 65 more shrimp and squid pieces to finish all the food.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $7 million as her inheritance. She spent some money on various things and had $5 million left. So, we can start by subtracting the amount she spent from the total inheritance: $7 million - $5 million = $2 million. Therefore, Gwen spent $2 million after inheriting the money.

Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $8 dollars from her mother. Then, her father gave her an additional $5 dollars. In total, she received $13 dollars ($8 + $5). If she spent $4 dollars, how much money did she have left?   Solution:  To find out how much money Gwen had left, we need to subtract the amount she spent ($4) from the total amount she received ($13):   $13 - $4 = $9  Therefore, Gwen had $9 dollars left after spending $4 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $3 dollars from her mother.  Secondly, she received another $6 dollars from her father, so in total, she received $9 dollars ($3 + $6).   If she spent $4 dollars, then she has $5 dollars left ($9 - $4 = $5).
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, so she has a total of $12.  If she spends $4, then she will be left with $8.   Therefore, the amount that Gwen's mother gave her is greater than what her father gave her.
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she has a total of $7. If she spends $6, she will be left with $1. Therefore, the amount of money that Gwen will receive from her father is $1 more than what her mother gave her. In other words, Gwen's father gave her $2 more than her mother did. So the answer is $2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Choom has 9 children in total. Secondly, she has lost some of her chicks, and only 4 are left with her now. So, if Choom had 9 chicks initially and lost some, then the number of chicks she lost is equal to the difference between 9 and 4, which is 5 (9 - 4 = 5). Therefore, Choom has lost 5 chicks.
Response:  If 21 - 12 = 9, then there are 9 more children in the larger group.  So, if the smaller group has 12 children, the larger group would have 9 + 12 = 21 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jochum has 19 children in total. Secondly, he mentions that 11 of his children are boys and 5 are girls.

Response:  Firstly, we know that โจช์ (Jo) has 22 children and each child gives her 20 more children. So, in total, Jo has 22 x 20 = 440 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 children in total. Secondly, we know that 5 of them have blue eyes. So, to find out how many children have brown eyes, we need to subtract the number of children with blue eyes from the total number of children. In this case, it would be:  11 - 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 children with brown eyes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Choom has 22 children in her kindergarten class.  Secondly, she found 13 more kids playing outside.  Lastly, she saw 5 more kids hiding behind the bushes.  Therefore, the total number of kids that Choom has is:  22 + 13 + 5 = 38 kids.
Response:  Firstly, we know that โจช์ has 15 children in her collar. Then she found 9 more puppies. So, the total number of puppies she has is:  15 + 9 = 24 puppies. However, she lost 23 puppies, so the net number of puppies she has left is:  24 - 23 = 1 puppy. Therefore, โจช์ has one puppy left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three kids in the first group and six kids in the second group. So, if we add these two groups together, we get 3 + 6 = 9 kids in total. Now, we know that some of the kids from the first group have gone missing, so we need to subtract them from the total number of kids. We are told that five kids from the first group have gone missing, so we subtract 5 from 9: 9 - 5 = 4 kids left after some kids from the first group have gone missing. Therefore, the answer is 4 kids.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight of Mao's hair is 4 pounds (4 ปอนด์). Secondly, we know that the weight of his beard is 19 pounds (19 ปอนด์). Finally, we want to find out how much heavier Mao's beard is compared to his hair. To do this, we can subtract the weight of his hair from the weight of his beard:  19 - 4 = 15 pounds. So, Mao's beard is 15 pounds heavier than his hair.
Response:  First, we know that the weight of the water in the bucket is 35 pounds (35 lb). Next, we need to find out how much more weight the father has to carry compared to the mother. We can do this by subtracting the weight of the mother's load from the total weight of the father's load. So, if the weight of the mother's load is x pounds, then the weight of the father's load would be 35 + x pounds. Now, we are asked to find out how many pounds more the father has to carry than the mother. To do this, we can subtract x from 35 + x, like this:  35 + x - x = 35 + x - x = 2x + 35 = 2x + 35 pounds. Therefore, the father has to carry 2x + 35 pounds more than the mother, where x is the weight of the mother's load.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total weight of the father and son is 20 + 17 = 37 pounds.   Secondly, we are given that the weight of the mother is equal to the sum of the weights of the father and son, so we can write:   Weight of Mother = Weight of Father + Weight of Son  37 = 20 + 17  37 - 20 = 17  17 = 7   Therefore, the weight of the mother is 7 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight of the father's urine is 32 pounds (32 ปอนด์). Secondly, we are given that the weight of the son's urine is 8 pounds (8 ปอนด์) less than the father's urine. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the son's urine as follows: Weight of son's urine = Weight of father's urine - 8 pounds Weight of son's urine = 32 pounds - 8 pounds Weight of son's urine = 24 pounds So, the total weight of the two men's urine together is: Total weight of urine = Weight of father's urine + Weight of son's urine Total weight of urine = 32 pounds + 24 pounds Total weight of urine = 56 pounds
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight of one can of sardines is 24 pounds (24 x 0.5 kg = 12 kg). Secondly, we know that the total weight of all the cans of sardines is 9 pounds (9 x 0.5 kg = 4.5 kg). Thirdly, we know that each can of sardines contains three pieces of sardines. Therefore, the weight of three pieces of sardines in one can is 3 pounds (3 x 0.5 kg = 1.5 kg). Finally, since there are nine cans of sardines, the total weight of all the sardines is 9 x 1.5 kg = 13.5 kg. So, the weight of the father's share of sardines is 13.5 kg - 4.5 kg = 9 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight of the marble is 36 pounds (36 lb). Secondly, we know that the weight of the father is 8 pounds (8 lb) more than the weight of the marble. Therefore, the weight of the father is: Weight of father = Weight of marble + 8 lb Weight of father = 36 lb + 8 lb Weight of father = 44 lb Now, we need to find out how much water each person can drink based on their weights. To do this, we will use the formula: Water volume = Weight x Specific gravity x Density of water Where: Weight is the weight of the person in pounds (lb), Specific gravity is the specific gravity of the substance being used (in this case, it is water), and Density of water is the density of water, which is approximately 1 gram per milliliter (g/mL). Since the weight of the marble is given as 36 pounds, let's convert it to kilograms: Weight of marble (kg) = Weight of marble (lb) / 0.453592 kg/lb Weight of marble (kg) = 36 lb / 0.453592 kg/lb Weight of marble (kg) ≈ 79.05 kg Now, let's calculate the amount of water each person can drink based on their weights: Water volume for marble = Weight of marble x Specific gravity x Density of water Water volume for marble ≈ 79.05 kg x 1.00 g/cm³ x 1000 mL/kg ≈ 79050 mL Water volume for father = Weight of father x Specific gravity x Density of water Water volume for father ≈ 44 lb x 1.00 g/cm³ x 1000 mL/kg ≈ 44000 mL Based on the calculations above, the amount of water each person can drink is: Marble: 79050 mL Father: 44000 mL
Response:  First, we know that the weight of the water in the bucket is 22 pounds (4 x 5.5 = 22).  Next, we know that the weight of the water in the second bucket is 30 pounds (5 x 5.5 = 30). Finally, we want to find out how much the weight of the sand in both buckets combined is. To do this, we need to subtract the weight of the water in the first bucket from the weight of the water in the second bucket. So, if we subtract 22 pounds from 30 pounds, we get:  30 - 22 = 8 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the sand in both buckets combined is 8 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total weight of Margo and her father is 37 pounds (30 + 7). Now, let's calculate the weight of Margo alone. We know that she has 15 pounds of books in her backpack, so if we subtract the weight of the books from her total weight, we get:  37 - 15 = 22 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Margo alone is 22 pounds.
Response:  First, we know that the volume of water in the bucket of Margo is 30 liters.  Next, we know that the combined volume of water in both buckets is 17 + 30 = 47 liters.  Finally, we want to find out how much more water Margo has compared to her father. To do this, we subtract the volume of water in her father's bucket from the volume of water in her bucket:  30 - 17 = 13 liters.  So, Margo has 13 liters more water than her father does.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total weight of Margo and her father is 26 pounds (10 + 16). Now, let's calculate how much heavier Margo's father is compared to Margo. We can do this by subtracting Margo's weight from her father's weight. So, if we subtract 10 pounds from 26 pounds, we get:  26 - 10 = 16 pounds. Therefore, Margo's father is 16 pounds heavier than Margo.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total weight of the father and son is 11 + 30 = 41 pounds.  Secondly, we are given that the weight of the son is 30 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the father must be:  41 - 30 = 11 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, there are 5 children standing in line at the entrance of the amusement park. Each child has 3 friends with them, so there are 5 x 3 = 15 children standing in line altogether. Next, we know that each child is given a wristband after entering the park, and this wristband allows them to ride all the rides for free. So, if there were only 15 children in the line, they would be able to ride all the rides for free without any problem. However, the question states that there are more than 10 children waiting in line, which means that there must be at least 16 children in total (15 from the original line + 1 additional child). Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 26 children in the first row of the bus.  Secondly, each child in the first row has 38 children standing behind them, so altogether, there are 26 x 38 = 1048 children in the second row.  Therefore, the total number of children in both rows is 26 + 1048 = 1074 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 children in total, and 2 children are sitting on each side of the bus. Therefore, the number of children who have not yet boarded the bus is:  41 - (2 x 2) = 41 - 4 = 37.  So, there are 37 children left to board the bus.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 43 children in total. Of those, 21 children are inside the school bus (the yellow bus). So, how many children are left outside the school bus? To find out, we subtract the number of children inside the bus from the total number of children:  43 - 21 =?  The result is: 22 children are left outside the school bus.
Response:  Firstly, there are 41 children in total who are waiting for the bus.   Secondly, 18 of them have already boarded the bus, leaving 23 children still waiting.  Therefore, the number of children waiting for the bus before the bus stop is greater than 23.  The correct answer is 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 children in total who are waiting to board the bus. Secondly, we know that 10 children have already boarded the bus and left, leaving us with 11 children still waiting. Finally, we know that 4 more children will join them from another place, bringing the total number of children waiting at the bus stop to 15 (11 + 4). Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 children in the car and each child has 2 bags of candy. So, the total number of candies is 5 x 2 = 10 bags of candy. Now, let's consider the situation where some children enter the car while others leave. We can start by assuming that 14 children enter the car (since this is the given information). To determine how many children left the car, we need to subtract the number of children who entered from the original number of children in the car. In this case, we have 63 - 14 = 49 children who did not enter the car. Therefore, there are 49 children who did not enter the car.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 children in the first group and each child has 6 friends, so the total number of children in the second group is 36 x 6 = 216.  Now, let's find out how many children are left over after combining both groups. We can do this by subtracting the number of children in the second group from the total number of children. Total number of children = 36 + 216 = 252. Number of children left over = 252 - 216 = 36. Therefore, there are 36 children left over after combining both groups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 children in the school bus. Secondly, we know that 40 children get off the bus, leaving 2 children left on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 40 - 2 = 38. So, the correct answer is 38.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 children in the playground and 82 children in total. This means that there are 82 - 28 = 54 more children who have left the playground.   Secondly, we know that there are 30 children remaining in the playground. Therefore, the number of children who have left the playground is equal to the difference between the total number of children and the number of children remaining in the playground, which is:  54 = (82 - 30) So, there are 54 children who have left the playground.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 23 children in the school bus and 24 children in total, including those who got off the bus. So, if 8 children got off the bus, then there were originally 23 + 8 = 31 children on the bus.   Therefore, the number of children left on the bus after 8 got off is 31 - 8 = 23.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 133 chicken pieces in total. Secondly, we know that 51 chicken pieces were sold. So, to find out how many more chicken pieces were made, we need to subtract the number of chicken pieces sold from the total number of chicken pieces. Therefore, the formula we can use is: Total - Sold = More. In this case, it would be: 133 - 51 =? To solve for the unknown variable (More), we simply subtract 51 from 133: 133 - 51 = 82. Therefore, there are 82 more chicken pieces made than the 51 chicken pieces that were sold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 54 chairs in total and 13 of them have been sold. So, to find out how many chairs are left unsold, we can subtract 13 from 54:  54 - 13 =?  The result is 41. Therefore, there are 41 chairs left unsold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 145 people in total who have bought the product. Secondly, we know that 72 of them have not yet returned their products. Therefore, to find out how many people have returned their products, we can subtract 72 from 145: 145 - 72 = 73 So, 73 people have returned their products.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the original price of the necklace is 155 baht and her friend bought it from her for 140 baht. So, the loss of the seller (the girl) is equal to the difference between the two prices:  💰 Loss = 155 - 140 = 15 baht  Now, if the buyer (her friend) wants to return the necklace to the seller, the seller will receive back the amount she sold it for, which is 140 baht. Therefore, the gain of the seller (the girl) when her friend returns the necklace is equal to the amount she received back minus the loss she incurred earlier:  💰 Gain = 140 - 15 = 125 baht  So, the final answer is: The girl will gain 125 baht if her friend returns the necklace to her.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the old machine had 121 pieces and was sold for 105 pieces. So, the number of pieces left is:  121 - 105 = 16 pieces. Now, let's consider the new machine. We bought 170 pieces of new machines. So, the total number of machines (old + new) is:  16 + 170 = 186 pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces left after selling both machines is:  186 - 105 = 81 pieces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the old owner sold 91 pieces of land for $13 each, so the total amount received from the sale is:  91 x $13 = $1,173.  Next, we know that the new owner bought 154 pieces of land for $15 each, so the total amount paid for the purchase is:  154 x $15 = $2,260.  Finally, we need to find out how much profit the new owner made from the deal. To do this, we subtract the amount received from the amount paid: Profit = Amount Paid - Amount Received = $2,260 - $1,173 = $1,087.  So, the new owner made a profit of $1,087 from the deal.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the seller sold 78 pieces of jewelry and bought 31 new ones. So, if we subtract the number of new jewelry purchased from the total number of old jewelry sold, we get:  78 - 31 = 47  Therefore, the seller has sold more than 47 pieces of jewelry.
"Response:  First, we know that the original batch of cookies was 110 chips.  Second, we know that 75 chips were sold.  Third, we know that the remaining 35 chips (110 - 75 = 35) were remade into new cookies.  Fourth, we know that each new cookie is made from 2/3 of a original cookie (since 76 chips are made from 35 original chips).  Therefore, the number of new cookies can be calculated as follows:  
New cookies = Remaining original cookies x Number of chips in each new cookie 
= 35 x 2/3 
= 23 new cookies 
So, there will be 23 new cookies after remaking the remaining original ones."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer sold 71 chickens and kept 111 chickens. So, to find out how many more chickens were hatched, we need to subtract the number of chickens sold from the total number of chickens left with the farmer. Total number of chickens = 111 - 71 = 40 chickens. Therefore, the farmer hatched 40 more chickens.
Response:  First, we know that there are 149 chicken pieces and 91 pieces of pork.  If they sell 10 chicken pieces and 90 pieces of pork, how many more chicken pieces will be left over?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of items sold from the total number of items available.  In this case, we can subtract 10 + 90 = 100 from 149.  So, there will be 49 chicken pieces leftover (149 - 100).
Response:  First, we know that the baker has 7 chickens and 148 eggs.  If he sells 15 chickens and 103 eggs, how many more eggs will he have left?   To find out, let's subtract the number of chickens and eggs sold from the total number of chickens and eggs:   Total number of chickens = 7 + 15 = 22   Total number of eggs = 148 + 103 = 251   Now, let's subtract the number of chickens and eggs sold from the total number of chickens and eggs:   Eggs left = 251 - 103 = 148   Chickens left = 22 - 15 = 7   So, the baker will have 148 eggs and 7 chickens left after selling 15 chickens and 103 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of cans of sardines sold is 115 - 81 = 34 more than the number of cans of corn sold.  Secondly, we know that the total number of cans of both items sold is 126. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two facts:  34 + x = 126 where x represents the number of cans of corn sold. Solving for x, we get:  x = 92 So, there were 92 cans of corn sold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker has 19 pieces of cake and 131 pieces of pastry in total. If they sell 70 pieces of cake and 88 pieces of pastry, how many more pieces of pastry did they sell than cake? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes available. In this case, if they sell 70 pieces of cake, there will be 19 - 70 = 12 remaining cakes. However, the baker also sells 88 pieces of pastry, so they must have sold all 12 remaining cakes. Therefore, the baker sold 12 more pieces of pastry than cake.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total weight of all the ingredients in both recipes. For Recipe A, there are 157 chicken pieces and 169 vegetables, so the total weight is:  157 x 0.2 kg/chicken piece + 169 x 0.3 kg/vegetable = 31.4 kg + 50.7 kg = 82.1 kg For Recipe B, there are 147 chicken pieces and 169 vegetables, so the total weight is:  147 x 0.2 kg/chicken piece + 169 x 0.3 kg/vegetable = 29.4 kg + 50.7 kg = 80.1 kg Now, let's compare the weights of the two recipes:  82.1 kg (Recipe A) > 80.1 kg (Recipe B) So, based on the weight alone, it appears that Recipe A has more food than Recipe B. However, this does not take into account other factors such as portion sizes or nutritional content. Therefore, it is important to consider these additional factors when comparing the two recipes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of cans of sardines sold is 68. Secondly, we know that the number of pieces of dried fish sold is 92. Finally, we want to find out how many more cans of sardines were sold than pieces of dried fish. To do this, we subtract the number of pieces of dried fish from the number of cans of sardines:  68 - 92 =? Solution: Subtracting 92 from 68 gives us: 68 - 92 = -24 So, there are 24 fewer cans of sardines sold than pieces of dried fish. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  If we start with 44 chips and add 4 more chips (to make it 48), how many more chips do we need to add to reach 100 chips in total?   To find out, we can subtract the number of chips we already have (44) from the desired total (100): 100 - 44 = 56 So, we need to add 56 more chips to reach 100 chips in total.
"Response:  If A has 8 chips and makes 40 chips, then for every 5 chips she makes, she will have to add 1 chip from her original 8 chips. So, A needs to add 8/5 = 1.6 chips (round up to the nearest whole number) to make 40 chips. Therefore, A needs to add 2 chips to her original 8 chips to make 40 chips.  
Question: What if B has 16 chips and makes 40 chips? How many extra chips does B need to add?  Answer: Using the same logic as before, if B has 16 chips and makes 40 chips, then for every 4 chips she makes, she will have to add 1 chip from her original 16 chips. So, B needs to add 16/4 = 4 chips (round up to the nearest whole number) to make 40 chips. Therefore, B needs to add 4 chips to her original 16 chips to make 40 chips."
Response:  First, we know that the original price of the goods was 137 baht per kilogram.  If the manufacturer increases the price to 169 baht per kilogram, it means that the new price is 32 baht higher than the old price.   To find out how many kilograms of goods can be produced with the increased price, we need to divide the increase in price (32 baht) by the old price (137 baht).  Doing so gives us:  32 baht / 137 baht = 0.235 or approximately 24% increase in production.  Therefore, if the manufacturer produces 100 kilograms of goods at the old price of 137 baht per kilogram, they could produce approximately 24 more kilograms (or 100 x 0.235 = 23.5 kilograms) at the new price of 169 baht per kilogram.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker has 173 pieces of cake left. Secondly, he sold 103 new pieces of cake and only 86 old pieces were sold. So, to find out how many pieces of cake the baker still has, we need to subtract the number of new pieces sold from the total number of pieces he had. Total pieces = 173 - 103 + 86 = 173 - 103 + 86 = 70 pieces of cake. Therefore, the baker still has 70 pieces of cake left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of new shares issued is 167 - 89 = 78 shares.  Next, we need to find out how many old shares were sold. We are given that the total number of shares sold is 99. So, if we subtract the number of new shares sold (78) from the total number of shares sold (99), we get:  99 - 78 = 21 shares of old stock were sold. Therefore, the net increase in shares outstanding is:  78 + 21 = 99 shares.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer bought 139 chickens and sold 145 chickens. So, the difference between the number of chickens sold and the number of chickens bought is:  

145 - 139 = 6 
Therefore, the farmer gained 6 chickens from selling the eggs."
Response:  First, we know that the original bucket had 62 chunks of ice cream.  Next, we know that the mountain goat ate 149 - 62 = 87 chunks of ice cream. Finally, we know that the mountain goat sold 144 chunks of ice cream. So, to find out how many chunks of ice cream the mountain goat has left, we can subtract the number of chunks sold from the number of chunks eaten:  87 - 144 = -57 chunks of ice cream. Therefore, the mountain goat has -57 chunks of ice cream left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of chickens is 81 + 92 = 173 chickens. Secondly, we know that the farmer sold 46 chickens. Therefore, to find out how many more chickens the farmer has after selling 46 chickens, we need to subtract the number of chickens sold from the total number of chickens. So, 173 - 46 = 127 chickens. The correct answer is 127 chickens.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pieces of candy is 61 + 167 = 228.  Next, we know that the number of pieces of candy sold was 108. So, to find out how many more pieces of candy were left over, we subtract 108 from 228:  228 - 108 = 120. Therefore, there are 120 pieces of candy left over after selling 108 pieces.
Response:  First, we know that the baker has 56 pieces of bread and 124 pieces of cake. If they sell 104 pieces of cake and 29 pieces of bread, how many more loaves of bread will they have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes they had: 124 - 104 = 20. Now, let's subtract the number of bread rolls sold (29) from the remaining bread: 56 - 29 = 27. So, after selling 104 pieces of cake and 29 pieces of bread, the baker will have 27 loaves of bread left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 52 pieces of candy and 84 cookies in total. If they sell 102 candies and 94 cookies, we need to find out how many more candies than cookies were sold. To do this, subtract the number of cookies from the total number of candies:  102 - 84 = 18 Candies were sold more than cookies. Therefore, if they sold 102 candies and 94 cookies, they sold 18 more candies than cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of cans (k) is equal to the total weight in grams divided by the weight of one can (w). So, k = T / w, where T is the total weight in grams and w is the weight of one can in grams. We are given that T = 134 + 11 = 145 grams and w = 92 grams. Therefore, k = 145 / 92 = 16 cans.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of canned goods sold is 97 pieces. Next, we need to find out how many sets of 8 canned goods are in 97 pieces. To do this, we divide 97 by 8, which gives us: 97 / 8 = 12 So, there are 12 sets of 8 canned goods in 97 pieces. Now, let's calculate how many canned goods are not part of any set of 8. We can do this by subtracting the number of sets of 8 from 97: 97 - 12 = 85 Therefore, there are 85 canned goods that are not part of any set of 8. Finally, we add the number of sets of 8 and the number of individual canned goods not part of any set of 8 to get the total number of canned goods sold: 12 + 85 = 97 So, the total number of canned goods sold is 97.
Response:  First, we know that the number of canned goods sold is 154 - 78 = 76 more than the original amount. Next, we need to find out how many more pieces of fruit were sold. We know that the number of fruits sold is 43 + 76 = 119 more than the original amount. Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total increase in sales: 119 + 76 = 195. So, the total increase in sales was 195 items.
Response:  If she has 22 games and wants to buy more to have 140 games in total, we can start by finding out how many more games she needs to buy. To do this, we subtract the number of games she already has (22) from the desired total (140): 140 - 22 = 118. So, she needs to buy 118 more games.
"Response:  If there are 106 games in total and 64 games have been played, then the number of remaining games is:  
106 - 64 = 42 games."
Response:  If she has played 91 games and wants to know how many more games she needs to play to reach 92 games, we can calculate as follows:  92 - 91 = 1 game. So, she needs to play one more game to reach 92 games.
Response:  We have 20 games and we want to choose 12 of them for the tournament. To do this, we can use combinations. There are 20 games in total, so there are 20 choices for the first game, 19 choices for the second game (since one game has already been chosen), and so on until there are 19 choices for the twelfth game. In total, there are C(20, 12) = C(20, 8) x C(12, 4) = 2520 x 12 = 3024 possible combinations of 12 games. So, there are 3024 possible ways to choose 12 games from the pool of 20 games.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many games are there in total. Total number of games = Number of games + Number of sonic games. We know that there are 46 games and 132 sonic games, so: Total number of games = 46 + 132 = 178 games. Now, we need to find out how many games Sonic has. We know that Sonic has 31 games, so: Number of Sonic games = 31. Therefore, the answer is: 178 - 31 = 147 games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 80 games in total and 31 of them are already played, so the number of games left to be played is:  80 - 31 = 49. Now, we need to find out how many games Thai needs to play such that she has played 6 games in total. To do this, we can use the fact that Thai has already played 31 games, so the number of games she needs to play is:  49 - 31 = 18. Therefore, Thai needs to play 18 more games to have played 6 games in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 52 cards in a deck of playing cards.  Secondly, we know that each card has four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). Therefore, if we divide 52 by 4, we get 13 as our quotient. This means that there are 13 hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades in a deck of playing cards.   Now, let's consider the question. If we take away 38 cards from the deck, how many hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades will be left? To find out, we can subtract 38 from 13. Here's the calculation: 13 - 38 =? The result is 0. This means that if we take away 38 cards from a deck of playing cards, there will be no hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades left!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ran has 97 blocks in total and she uses 72 of them to build the wall. So, how many blocks does she have left after building the wall? To find out, we need to subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks available. In this case, we can do:  97 - 72 =?  The result is:  97 - 72 = 25 blocks. Therefore, Ran has 25 blocks left after building the wall.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 79 blocks in total. Secondly, we know that 14 blocks were used to build the wall and 11 blocks were used to build the house. Therefore, we can subtract the number of blocks used for building the wall and the house from the total number of blocks to find out how many blocks are left over. So, the calculation is as follows: Total blocks - Blocks used for wall - Blocks used for house = Number of blocks left over. 79 - 14 - 11 =? Solution: 79 - 14 - 11 = 54 blocks left over.
Response:  Firstly, she used 27 blocks to build the foundation of the house. Next, she used 53 blocks to build the walls of the house. In total, she used  27 + 53 = 80 blocks to build both the foundation and the walls of the house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ran has 37 blocks in total and she uses 33 blocks to build a house. Therefore, the number of blocks left for building other structures is:  37 - 33 = 4 blocks.  Next, we are told that Ran uses 13 blocks to build a fence around her property. So, the remaining number of blocks available for building other structures after constructing the fence would be:  4 - 13 = -9 blocks (since negative numbers indicate a deficit or shortage).  However, since it is not possible to have a negative number of blocks, we can conclude that Ran does not have enough blocks to build any more structures.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ran has 86 blocks in total and she used 79 blocks to build the house. Therefore, the number of blocks left for building the pond is:  86 - 79 = 7 blocks.  Secondly, we know that Ran used 82 blocks to build the pond. So, the difference between the number of blocks used to build the pond and the number of blocks left after building the house is:  82 - 7 = 75 blocks.  Finally, we can calculate the ratio of blocks used for building the pond compared to the number of blocks used for building the house by dividing the difference by the total number of blocks available:  75 / 86 = 0.875 or approximately 88%.  Therefore, Ran used about 88% of her total blocks (86) to build the pond.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ran has 36 blocks in total and she wants to build a wall with 59 blocks. So, if she uses all her blocks, how many blocks will be left over? To find out, we can subtract the number of blocks she needs (59) from the total number of blocks she has (36): 36 - 59 =? Solution: 36 - 59 = -23. Therefore, if Ran uses all her blocks to build a wall with 59 blocks, she will have 23 blocks left over.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ran has 95 blocks in total and she uses 20 blocks to build her house. Therefore, the number of blocks left for building the palace is:  95 - 20 = 75 blocks.  Next, we know that Ran uses 50 blocks to build the palace. So, the remaining number of blocks after building the palace is:  75 - 50 = 25 blocks.  Finally, we can see that Ran has 25 blocks left over after building both the house and the palace.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ran has used 89 blocks to build her house and 63 blocks to build her rabbit hutch. So, in total, she has used 89 + 63 = 152 blocks.   Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for building the house and the number of blocks used for building the rabbit hutch is:  152 - 63 = 89 blocks.
Response:  If there are 20 volumes of the novel and you have already read 5 volumes, then you still need to read 15 more volumes (20 - 5 = 15).
Response:  If there are 13 lessons in total and you have already read 8 of them, then you still need to read 5 more lessons (13 - 8 = 5).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 22. Secondly, we know that there are 10 stories in the book. Thirdly, we know that each story has an average of 12 pages (based on the fact that there are 56 pages in total). Therefore, to calculate how many more pages the reader needs to read, we can use the following formula: Total Pages - Number of Stories x Average Page Count per Story = Number of More Pages to Read. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  22 - 10 x 12 =? To find out how many more pages the reader needs to read, we need to solve for the unknown value (in this case, ""?""), which gives us:  22 - 10 x 12 = 22 - 120 = -98. Since the result is negative, it means that the reader has already read all the stories and does not have any more pages to read. So, the answer is 0."
Response:  If there are 19 volumes of manga and 7 episodes of anime, we can start by finding out how many chapters or scenes each volume/episode has. For example, if each volume has 5 chapters, then there would be 19 x 5 = 95 chapters in total. Similarly, if each episode has 3 scenes, then there would be 7 x 3 = 21 scenes in total. Now, let's calculate the number of unique scenes in both the manga and anime. To do this, we need to subtract the number of repeated scenes from the total number of scenes. In this case, since each chapter/scene is independent of the others, all 95 chapters/scenes in the manga and all 21 scenes in the anime are unique. Therefore, the final answer is: There are 95 unique scenes in the manga and 21 unique scenes in the anime.
Response:  If there are 16 volumes of manga and each volume has 10 chapters (on average), then there would be 16 x 10 = 160 chapters in total. However, if we add up all the chapters from all the volumes, we get 160 + 150 +... + 10 = 1700 chapters! This is because each volume has an average of 10 chapters, so there are 1700 chapters in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 1700.
"Response:  If there are 19 volumes of manga and each volume has 10 episodes, then there would be 19 x 10 = 190 episodes in total. However, if we add up all the episodes from both the manga and anime versions, we get:  

Manga (19 volumes x 10 episodes/volume) = 190 episodes Anime (61 episodes) + Manga = 251 episodes Therefore, there are 251 episodes in total for the ""Crazy Silly School"" series, covering both the manga and anime versions."
Response:  If we have 10 books and watch 11 movies, that means we have more movies than books. So, if we compare the number of movies to the number of books, we can say that we have watched more movies than we have read books. Specifically, we have watched 11 movies and read 10 books, so the difference is 1 movie more than the number of books. Therefore, our answer is 1.
Response:  If there are 11 volumes of manga and each volume has 7 chapters, then there would be 11 x 7 = 77 chapters in total. However, if we add up all the chapters from all the volumes, it would be 77 + 77 +... + 77 = 843 chapters (since there are 11 volumes). Therefore, the correct answer is 843 chapters.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 volumes in total for ""The Magic School Bus"" series. If we have already read 8 volumes, then we still need to read 6 more volumes to complete the entire series."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 62 pages in the first book and 19 pages in each of the other books. Therefore, if you read four books, you would have read a total of 62 + (4 x 19) = 62 + 76 = 138 pages. However, since you only read three books, you would have read a total of 62 + (3 x 19) = 62 + 57 = 119 pages. So, to complete all six books, you would need to read an additional 19 pages.
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, that means you have consumed 7 + 4 = 11 pieces of content in total. To determine how many more movies you need to watch, we can subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of items in the collection (21 - 7 = 14). Therefore, you still need to watch 14 / 4 = 3 more movies to complete the collection.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 volumes of ""โรงเรียนบ้านบิ๊กโซ่"" and each volume has 11 chapters, so the total number of chapters is:  14 x 11 = 154 chapters.  Secondly, we know that there are 40 episodes of ""โรงเรียนบ้านบิ๊กโซ่"" and each episode is based on 2-3 chapters, so the total number of episodes is:  40 / 2-3 = 13-16 episodes (depending on how many chapters are combined per episode). Therefore, if you read all 154 chapters of ""โรงเรียนบ้านบิ๊กโซ่"", you would have enough material for at least 13-16 episodes of a drama series."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. Next, we need to determine how many of these are movies and how many are books. We can do this by subtracting the number of books from the total number of items in the series. So, if we subtract 11 (books) from 17 (movies + books), we get:  17 - 11 = 6 This means that there are 6 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. Therefore, the answer is 6."
Response:  If the person has read 14 books and watched 19 movies in total, we can calculate how many more books they have read compared to the number of movies they have watched.   To do this, we need to subtract the number of movies from the total number of books and movies.  So, if the person has read 14 books and watched 19 movies, we can calculate as follows:  14 (books) - 19 (movies) =?  The difference between the number of books and the number of movies is 5 (14 - 19).  Therefore, the person has read 5 more books than movies.
Response:  If there are 19 volumes of manga and each volume has 5 stories, then there would be 19 x 5 = 95 stories in total. However, if we have already watched 16 episodes of anime adaptations, that means we have seen 16/95 or approximately 17% of the total number of stories. So, to answer your question, you have read more than 17% of the manga but less than 100%.
Response:  If the player has already received 7 rewards and wants to know how many more rewards they need to receive in total, we can calculate it as follows:  1. First, let's count the number of rewards the player has already received: 7 (reward cards) 2. Next, let's subtract the number of reward cards the player has already received from the total number of reward cards available: 2 (remaining reward cards) - 7 (already received reward cards) =? 3. Finally, we can solve for the unknown variable (the number of remaining reward cards the player needs to receive):? = 2 - 7 = -5 4. Since the result is negative, it means that the player needs to return all 5 reward cards they have already received to reach the total of 2 remaining reward cards. Therefore, the answer is -5.
Response:  If Dave has used 12 sheets of paper to make his game and he still needs to use more sheets, then he must have at least 13 sheets in total (12 + 1). Now, if he has 13 sheets and he wins the game, he will need to use 1 sheet less than before (since he already won), so he will be left with 12 sheets. Therefore, the number of sheets Dave will have after winning the game is 12.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the player has received 18 pieces of candy. Secondly, they have spent 5 pieces to buy a drink and 11 pieces to buy a snack. Therefore, the number of candies left with the player is:  18 - (5 + 11) = 18 - 16 = 2. So, the player has 2 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of t-shirts purchased is 12 + 7 = 19 t-shirts. Secondly, we know that each t-shirt costs $10. Therefore, the total cost of all t-shirts is 19 x $10 = $190. Lastly, we know that the player spent $190 on t-shirts and used $7 to buy socks. So, the amount of money left after buying t-shirts is $190 - $7 = $183.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of t-shirts purchased is 8 + 18 = 26 t-shirts.  Next, we need to find out how many more t-shirts are needed to be purchased in order to reach the goal of 30 t-shirts. To do this, we subtract the number of t-shirts already purchased (26) from the desired number of t-shirts (30):  30 - 26 = 4 t-shirts. Therefore, the player needs to purchase an additional 4 t-shirts to reach their goal.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has received 14 pieces of candy and spent 2 pieces to buy the game. So, he has 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of candy left. Now, if he spends 10 pieces of candy to play the game, he will have 12 - 10 = 2 pieces of candy left. Therefore, David can play the game for 2 rounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 14 trees in the garden of the house where she lived. After 9 years had passed, only 3 trees remained. So, how many more trees died during those 9 years? To find out, we need to subtract the number of remaining trees (3) from the initial number of trees (14). Doing so gives us:  14 - 3 = 11 Therefore, 11 more trees died during those 9 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 trees in the garden of her house after she passed away. Next, we know that each tree has 6 branches. So, how many branches do all 13 trees have in total? To calculate this, we multiply 13 (the number of trees) by 6 (the number of branches per tree):  13 x 6 = 78 branches. Therefore, there are 78 branches in the garden of her house after she passed away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 trees in the garden of her house. Secondly, after 4 years have passed, only 4 trees remain alive. Therefore, to find out how many trees died, we subtract the number of remaining trees from the initial number of trees:  20 - 4 = 16. So, 16 trees died due to old age.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 tangerines in each bunch.  If there are 12 bunches, then there will be 5 x 12 = 60 tangerines in total.   Therefore, if she has eaten 3 bunches, she has eaten 3 x 5 = 15 tangerines.
Response:  Firstly, she had 9 pots of flowers in her garden before her husband passed away. Then, after 4 years, she added 5 more pots of flowers, making it a total of 14 pots of flowers now. So, the number of pots of flowers she has now is 14.
Response:  If Helia has planted 2 trees in her garden and each tree takes 12 years to grow, then she will have 2 x 12 = 24 trees after 12 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 13 trees in the garden before Helia died.  Secondly, we are given that Helia planted 3 new trees for every tree that died. Therefore, if 13 trees died, Helia would have planted 3 x 13 = 40 new trees.  So, the total number of trees in the garden after Helia died is 13 + 40 = 53 trees.
Response:  If there are 11 trees in the first row and each tree has 2 branches, then there will be 2 x 11 = 22 branches in the first row.  Now, if we assume that each branch has 3 leaves, then there will be 3 x 22 = 66 leaves in the first row.  However, since some of the leaves may have fallen off due to the storm, let's reduce this number by half to account for the loss. So, the total number of leaves left after the storm is approximately 66 / 2 = 33 leaves.
Response:  First, we know that each bag contains 28 eggs.  Second, we know that there are 66 bags in total.  Finally, we want to find out how many eggs are collected per day. To do this, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of eggs in each bag. So, the calculation is as follows:  66 bags x 28 eggs/bag = 1840 eggs/day
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of days it takes to collect 8 baskets is 1 day (since each basket takes 1 day). Therefore, the total number of days required to collect 24 baskets would be:  24 / 8 = 3 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 56 questions in total and it takes 4 days to finish all of them. So, if they spend half a day (12 hours) per day on the exam, they will have:  12 hours/day x 4 days = 48 hours  To calculate how many questions they can answer per hour, let's divide the number of questions by the time spent per hour:  56 questions / 48 hours = 1.17 questions/hour  Therefore, if they spend half a day (12 hours) per day on the exam, they can answer approximately 1.17 questions per hour or 56 questions in 48 hours.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of cement can cover 38 square meters per day.  Second, we know that there are 42 bags of cement in total. Third, we want to find out how many days it will take to finish the project if they work for 49 days. So let's start with the first step.  38 square meters / day x 42 bags = Total area covered  We can simplify this calculation as follows:  38 x 42 = 1676 square meters Now we need to convert this result into days. To do this, we divide the total area by the daily coverage:  1676 square meters / 38 square meters/day = 44 days Therefore, it will take 44 days to complete the project if they work for 49 days.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of rice contains 25 lumps.  If there are 66 bags of rice in total, then the number of lumps is:  66 x 25 = 1650 lumps.  Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the rats to eat all the rice if they have 87 lumps per day.  We can calculate this as follows:  1650 / 87 = 19 days.  Therefore, it will take the rats 19 days to eat all the rice if they consume 87 lumps per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of eggs collected per day is 8. Secondly, each nest has an average of 35 chicks. Therefore, to calculate the total number of chicks collected per day, we can multiply the number of nests visited per day (8) by the average number of chicks in each nest (35). So, the total number of chicks collected per day would be:  8 x 35 = 280 chicks per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each jar can hold 57 eggs and there are 16 jars in total. So, to calculate how many eggs can be collected in total, we need to multiply the number of jars by the number of eggs per jar.  16 x 57 = 922 eggs.  Secondly, we know that each day, 80 eggs are needed. To find out how many days it will take to collect enough eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the daily requirement.  922 / 80 = 11.5 days. Therefore, it will take approximately 11.5 days to collect enough eggs if each jar can hold 57 eggs and there are 16 jars in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each group of crows has 12 babies. If there are 35 groups of crows in total, then the total number of babies is 35 x 12 = 420 babies.
Response:  First, we know that there are 74 + 71 = 145 units of inventory at the beginning of the period. After 51 days, the inventory will be reduced by 74 + 71 = 145 units x 0.25 (depreciation rate) = 36 units. So, after 51 days, there will be 145 - 36 = 109 units of inventory left.
Response:  First, we know that the number of eggs collected per day is 76 eggs.  Next, we know that the number of days the chickens lay eggs is 64 days. Finally, we want to find out how many eggs the chickens will lay in total. To do this, we multiply the number of eggs laid per day by the number of days the chickens lay eggs:  76 eggs/day x 64 days = 4912 eggs (rounded to the nearest whole number).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 days in February and 52 weeks in a year (since each week has 7 days). Now, let's calculate how many days there will be after 26 weeks have passed.  26 weeks x 7 days/week = 180 days So, after 26 weeks have passed, there will be 180 days left in the year. Therefore, the number of days in the remaining 4 months (March to June) can be calculated as follows:  March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) = 132 days In total, there will be 180 + 132 = 312 days left in the year after 26 weeks have passed.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 82 successful attempts out of 100 tries (82/100 x 100% = 82%). Secondly, we can calculate the number of unsuccessful attempts as follows:  100 - 82 = 18 (unsuccessful attempts). Finally, to find out how many successful attempts will be made after 25 days, we need to divide the total number of successful attempts by the number of days it took to make those attempts:  82 / 25 = 3.28 (approximately) Therefore, after 25 days, there will be approximately 3.28 successful attempts per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 days in March and 24 days in April, so the total number of days from March to April is:  31 + 24 = 55 days.  Now, since the person has been sick for 45 days, we can subtract the number of days they were sick from the total number of days from March to April to find out how many more days they will be sick:  55 - 45 = 10 days.  Therefore, the person will be sick for an additional 10 days after April.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 44 good answers and 25 bad answers in total. Secondly, we can see that the number of good answers is greater than the number of bad answers. Therefore, we can conclude that the ratio of good answers to bad answers is greater than 1:1. Specifically, if we divide the total number of answers by the number of good answers, we get:  44/25 = 1.76 This means that for every one bad answer, there are approximately 1.76 good answers. So, the probability of getting a good answer is higher than the probability of getting a bad answer.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 good habits and 74 bad habits in total. Secondly, we can see that the number of good habits is less than half of the total number of habits (5/2 = 2). Finally, we can conclude that the number of good habits is 2 times the number of bad habits (2 x 74 = 148). Therefore, the correct answer is 148.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 54 questions in total and each question takes 18 minutes to complete. Therefore, the total time taken to complete all the questions is:  54 x 18 = 972 minutes or approximately 16 hours and 32 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 56 questions in total and each question takes 2 hours to complete. Therefore, the total time required to complete all the questions is:  56 x 2 = 112 hours. Since the group has 14 days (or 112 hours) to complete all the questions, they can afford to spend approximately:  112 hours / 14 days = 8 hours per day. So, the group needs to spend about 8 hours per day to finish all the questions within the given time frame.
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 sugary drinks consumed per day and 25 unsweetened drinks consumed per day. So, in total, there are 5 + 25 = 30 drinks consumed per day. Next, we know that the person consumes these drinks for 73 days. Therefore, the total number of drinks consumed over the 73-day period is 30 x 73 = 2190 drinks. Finally, to find out how many sugary drinks will be left after 73 days, we need to subtract the number of unsweetened drinks from the total number of sugary drinks. In this case, we have 5 x 73 = 365 sugary drinks - 25 x 73 = 1825 unsweetened drinks = 365 - 1825 = -1460 sugary drinks. So, after 73 days, there will be approximately -1460 sugary drinks left (since negative numbers indicate a decrease).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 46 sore points on the first day after taking the medicine, and then there are 65 sore points on the second day. So, in total, there are 46 + 65 = 111 sore points. After taking the medicine for 6 days, there will be no more sore points, so the number of remaining sore points is 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of days with rain is 86. Next, we need to find out how many days are left without rain. To do this, we subtract the number of rainy days from the total number of days in the month, which is 30. So, the formula would be:  30 - 86 = 56 Days without rain. Therefore, there are 56 days without rain in the month.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 - 71 = 11 more unripe mangoes than ripe ones. Secondly, for every 3 ripe mangoes picked, 2 unripe mangoes become ripe. So, if we pick 3 ripe mangoes, 2 x 11 = 22 unripe mangoes will become ripe. Therefore, after picking 3 ripe mangoes, there will be 60 - 22 = 38 unripe mangoes left. Finally, we can see that there are 38 unripe mangoes left after picking 3 ripe mangoes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many feet are added when the room is extended.  We know that the length of the new room is 12 feet longer than the original one. So, if the original room has a length of x feet, then the new room will have a length of x + 12 feet.  Secondly, we need to find out how much wider the new room is compared to the original one. We know that the width of the new room is 11 feet wider than the original one. So, if the original room has a width of y feet, then the new room will have a width of y + 11 feet.  Now, let's put these two pieces of information together. If the original room has a length of x feet and a width of y feet, then the new room will have a length of x + 12 feet and a width of y + 11 feet.  To find out how many feet the new room is in total, we add the lengths and widths of both rooms: Total length = x + (x + 12) = 2x + 12 feet Total width = y + (y + 11) = 2y + 11 feet Therefore, the new room is 2x + 12 feet long and 2y + 11 feet wide, where x and y are the dimensions of the original room.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the room is 7 feet (2.13 meters). Secondly, we are given that the width of the room is 14 feet (4.27 meters) greater than the length. So, we can write an equation based on these two pieces of information: Length + Width = Total Area Where Length is 7 feet and Width is 14 feet greater than Length. To find the width, we need to add 14 feet to the length: Width = Length + 14 feet Width = 7 feet + 14 feet Width = 21 feet Now we have all the dimensions of the room: Length = 7 feet Width = 21 feet Total Area = Length x Width Total Area = 7 feet x 21 feet Total Area = 147 square feet
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the room is 7 feet (2.13 meters) and the width is 14 feet (4.27 meters). To find out the area of the room, we need to multiply the length by the width. So, Area = Length x Width = 7 x 14 = 98 square feet.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the room that needs to be painted. The length and width of the room are given as 11 feet and 15 feet respectively. So, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet Now, let's assume that the ceiling height is 8 feet (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, the volume of paint required can be calculated as follows: Volume = Area x Height = 165 x 8 = 1320 cubic feet Since the problem states that the painter has 16 tubes of paint, each containing 40 fluid ounces, we can calculate how many tubes of paint will be needed for the project: Number of tubes = Volume / Fluid Ounces per Tube = 1320 / 40 = 33 tubes
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of each floor slab based on its length and width.  The length and width of each floor slab are given as 2 feet (ft) and 12 ft respectively. Therefore, the area of one floor slab is: Area = Length x Width = 2 ft x 12 ft = 24 sq ft Now, we need to find out how many floor slabs are required to cover the total area of the room. We know that the total area of the room is 480 sq ft. So, we can divide the total area by the area of one floor slab to get the number of floor slabs required: Number of floor slabs = Total area / Area per slab = 480 sq ft / 24 sq ft = 20 floor slabs Therefore, we need 20 floor slabs to cover the entire area of the room.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of all rooms combined. We know that each room has an area of 19 feet x 18 feet = 352 square feet. Since there are 20 rooms in total, the total area is:  352 sq ft x 20 rooms = 6,040 square feet.  Next, we need to calculate how much carpeting would be needed for the entire space if it were covered entirely with carpeting. To do this, we multiply the total area by the length and width of one piece of carpeting (let's assume it's 12 feet long and 6 feet wide). So:  6,040 sq ft x 12 ft x 6 ft = 72,480 square feet of carpeting.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many feet are in 19 yards. We know that there are 3 feet in 1 yard, so:  19 yards x 3 feet/yard = 57 feet  Now, we want to know how much wider is the room than the bed. The width of the room is given as 20 feet. So, we subtract the width of the bed (57 feet) from the width of the room (20 feet):  20 feet - 57 feet = -37 feet  This means that the room is 37 feet narrower than the bed!
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the room that is available for furniture placement. The length and width of the room are given as 5 meters and 3 meters, respectively. Therefore, the area of the room = length x width = 5 x 3 = 15 square meters. Next, we need to determine how many square feet the client wants to cover with carpeting. The client has requested 10 square feet of carpeting per foot of wall length. Since there are 4 walls in the room (2 long walls and 2 short walls), the total number of square feet required for carpeting = 10 x 4 = 40 square feet. Finally, we can calculate the height of the carpet needed based on the height of the room. If the ceiling height is 3 meters, then the carpet needs to be 3 meters high. So, the answer is:  Carpet Area = 15 square meters Height = 3 meters
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the room is 2 times the width of the room. So, if the width of the room is x feet, then the length of the room will be 2x feet. Now, we are given that the area of the room is 10 square feet and the perimeter of the room is equal to the sum of the lengths of all four walls. Therefore, we can write an equation based on these facts:   Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(2x + x) = 4x + 2x = 6x  Since we want the perimeter to be equal to 10, we can set up the following equation:  6x = 10  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10/6 = 1.67 feet  Therefore, the width of the room is 1.67 feet and the length of the room is twice the width, or 3.34 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the area of the room is 18 square feet (4 feet x 20 feet). Next, we need to calculate how much additional space Jessie needs for her furniture. Since she has four pieces of furniture with different sizes, let's assume an average size of each piece as 3 square feet. Therefore, the total area required for all four pieces of furniture would be:  3 square feet x 4 pieces = 12 square feet Now, we can add this value to the original area of the room to get the total amount of space Jessie needs: Total Area = 18 square feet + 12 square feet = 30 square feet So, Jessie needs at least 30 square feet of space for her furniture.
Response:  We know that the total number of yards gained by the Razorbacks in their two games was 230 yards.  We also know that they averaged 115 yards per game. So, to find out how many yards they gained in each game, we can divide the total number of yards by 2:  230 yards / 2 = 115 yards per game.  Now, let's find out how many yards they gained in each quarter. Since there are four quarters in a football game, we can divide the total number of yards gained in each game by 4:  115 yards per game / 4 = 28.75 yards per quarter.  Therefore, the Razorbacks gained 28.75 yards in each quarter of their two games.
"Response:  We know that each shirt costs $20 and there are 3 shirts in total. So, the total cost of all three shirts is $60 (3 x $20). Now, we need to find out how much money Razorback made from selling these shirts. To do this, we subtract the cost of producing one shirt ($20) from the revenue generated by selling one shirt ($51). This gives us:  
Revenue per shirt - Cost per shirt = $51 - $20 = $31 profit per shirt. Since there were 3 shirts sold, the total profit would be:  
Total Profit = Number of Shirts Sold x Profit Per Shirt Total Profit = 3 x $31 = $93. Therefore, Razorback made a profit of $93 from selling these three shirts."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of yards gained by the Razorbacks in both games is 87 + 95 = 182 yards. Secondly, we know that they scored 4 touchdowns in each game, so the total number of touchdowns scored is 4 x 2 = 8 touchdowns. Finally, we can calculate the average gain per touchdown as follows: Average gain per touchdown = Total yards gained / Number of touchdowns scored Average gain per touchdown = 182 yards / 8 touchdowns Average gain per touchdown = 23 yards per touchdown Therefore, the Razorbacks averaged 23 yards per touchdown in their two games.
Response:  We know that the total number of yards gained by the Razorbacks in both games is 242 yards.  In the game against Arkansas, they gained 115 yards. Therefore, we can subtract 115 from 242 to find out how many yards they gained in the game against Texas Tech:  242 - 115 = 127 So, the Razorbacks gained 127 yards in the game against Texas Tech.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of shirts sold in both games is 163. We also know that the team sold 89 shirts in the game against Arkansas. Therefore, to find out how many shirts were sold in the game against Texas Tech, we can subtract the number of shirts sold in the Arkansas game from the total number of shirts sold. So, the calculation would be:  163 - 89 = 74  Therefore, the team sold 74 shirts in the game against Texas Tech.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of yards gained by the Razorbacks in both games is 186 yards. Secondly, we know that they gained 172 yards in the game against Arkansas and 154 yards in the game against Texas Tech. Therefore, to find out how much money the Razorbacks made from selling their jerseys, we need to subtract the amount they spent on producing the jerseys from the total revenue they received. Let's assume that each jersey costs $78. So, if they sold x jerseys in each game, the revenue from jersey sales would be 78x. In the game against Arkansas, they sold x jerseys and earned $78x in revenue. In the game against Texas Tech, they sold y jerseys and earned $78y in revenue. To find out how much money the Razorbacks made from selling their jerseys overall, we add the revenue from both games: 78x + 78y. Now, let's substitute the values we know: 78x = 172(78) = 13,576 78y = 154(78) = 12,096 Total revenue from jersey sales = 13,576 + 12,096 = 25,672 dollars. Therefore, the Razorbacks made approximately $25,672 from selling their jerseys in these two games.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 183 t-shirts at $62 each.  Secondly, we need to subtract the cost of producing 31 t-shirts at $99 each. Finally, we can find out how much profit they made.   Calculation for Total Revenue:  Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt  Total Revenue = 183 x $62  Total Revenue = $11,466  Calculation for Cost of Producing T-Shirts:  Cost of Producing T-Shirts = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt  Cost of Producing T-Shirts = 31 x $99  Cost of Producing T-Shirts = $3,099  Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Producing T-Shirts  Profit = $11,466 - $3,099  Profit = $8,367  Therefore, the profit that the company made from selling t-shirts and sportswear is $8,367.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of shirts sold for each team. For Arkansas, they have sold 67 dolars worth of shirts for every 100 shirts sold, and for Texas Tech, they have sold 165 dollars worth of shirts for every 100 shirts sold. Therefore, the total number of shirts sold for Arkansas is:  67 x 100 = 6700 shirts Sold for Arkansas And the total number of shirts sold for Texas Tech is:  165 x 100 = 16500 shirts Sold for Texas Tech Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from selling these shirts. For Arkansas, the total amount of money earned is:  6700 x $67 = $439,900 And for Texas Tech, the total amount of money earned is:  16500 x $165 = $2,682,500 So, the difference between the two amounts is: $2,682,500 - $439,900 = $2,242,600
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each shirt and shorts separately. For the shirts, the cost is $192 / 157 = $1.23 per shirt. For the shorts, the cost is $34 / 19 = $1.79 per pair. Now, let's find out how many pairs of shorts can be bought with the same amount of money as one shirt. We have $1.79 per pair of shorts and $1.23 per shirt. So, we can buy  1.79/1.23 = 1.46 pairs of shorts with one shirt. Therefore, if you spend $192 on shirts, you can buy  192/1.23 = 158 shirts and  158 x 1.46 = 230 pairs of shorts.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of yards gained by both teams in each game. For Arkansas vs. Texas Tech, the Razorbacks gained 254 yards and the Red Raiders gained 43 yards, so the total is:  254 + 43 = 307 yards. Next, we need to convert the total yardage into dollars based on the given conversion rate of $86 per yard. Therefore, the total value of the yards gained by both teams in the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game is:  307 x $86 = $26,192. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. We are asked how much more did the Razorbacks gain than the Red Raiders in terms of yards. To find this out, we subtract the total yardage gained by the Red Raiders (43 yards) from the total yardage gained by the Razorbacks (254 yards):  254 - 43 = 211 yards. Finally, we can calculate the cost of these additional yards gained by the Razorbacks using the same conversion rate of $86 per yard:  211 x $86 = $17,696. So, the Razorbacks gained $17,696 more in yards than the Red Raiders in their game.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each shirt sold at $51 per unit. If they sell 8 units per shirt and have 130 shirts in total, then the total revenue generated from selling all 130 shirts would be:  8 x 130 = 1,040 units x $51 per unit = $52,940 in revenue.  Next, let's subtract the cost of producing one shirt, which is $20 per unit (based on the information provided). So, the profit made from selling all 130 shirts would be:   $52,940 - $2,400 (cost of producing 130 shirts) = $50,540 in profit.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of each shirt is $201.  We also know that they sold 14 shirts in total. So, to calculate the total revenue, we can multiply the number of shirts sold by the cost per shirt:   Total Revenue = Number of Shirts Sold x Cost Per Shirt  Total Revenue = 14 x $201  Total Revenue = $2844  Next, we need to subtract the cost price from the total revenue to find out the profit:  Profit = Total Revenue - Cost Price  Profit = $2844 - $201 x 14  Profit = $2844 - $2806  Profit = $378  Therefore, the profit made by selling these 14 shirts at $201 each is $378.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue of Arkansas and Texas Tech from selling t-shirts is $60,000. Secondly, we are given that they received a discount of $10 per shirt if they bought in bulk. Therefore, to find out how many t-shirts they sold, we can set up an equation as follows: Total Revenue = (Number of T-Shirts x Price Per Shirt) + Discount Received Total Revenue = ($60,000) = (Number of T-Shirts x $10) + $10 Number of T-Shirts = $\dfrac{Total Revenue - Discount Received}{Price Per Shirt}$ = $\dfrac{$60,000 - $10}{10}$ = 600 t-shirts So, Arkansas and Texas Tech sold 600 t-shirts in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 shirts in total.  Second, we know that each shirt costs $215. Therefore, to find out how much money was made from selling all 5 shirts, we can multiply the number of shirts by the cost per shirt:  5 x $215 = $1,075.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of shirts sold for each team. For Arkansas, they have sold 20 shirts, and for Texas Tech, they have sold 64 shirts. Therefore, the total number of shirts sold is:  

Arkansas: 20 shirts x $50 per shirt = $1,000  
Texas Tech: 64 shirts x $50 per shirt = $3,200  
Total: $1,000 + $3,200 = $4,200  Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from selling jerseys. We can do this by multiplying the total number of shirts sold by the price of each shirt. So, for Arkansas:  

$1,000 / $50 per shirt = 20 shirts  
For Texas Tech:  
$3,200 / $50 per shirt = 64 shirts  
Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling jerseys is:  

Arkansas: 20 shirts x $50 per shirt = $1,000  
Texas Tech: 64 shirts x $50 per shirt = $3,200  
Total: $1,000 + $3,200 = $4,200"
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money received from selling t-shirts and hoodies. We know that the profit margin for each item is $76 for t-shirts and $204 for hoodies. Therefore, the total amount of money received can be calculated as follows: T-shirts: 158 items x $76 profit margin = $11,968 Hoodies: 2 items x $204 profit margin = $408 Total amount of money received = $12,376 Next, we need to subtract the cost price of the items sold to find out the gross profit. The cost price of t-shirts is $30 per unit, so the total cost price of 158 t-shirts is: 158 units x $30 per unit = $4,740 The cost price of hoodies is $50 per unit, so the total cost price of 2 hoodies is: 2 units x $50 per unit = $100 Gross profit = Total amount of money received - Total cost price Gross profit = $12,376 - $4,840 Gross profit = $7,536 Finally, we need to convert the gross profit into dollars per item to determine how much each item contributed to the overall gross profit. To do this, we divide the gross profit by the number of items sold: For t-shirts: Gross profit per item = $7,536 / 158 items = $47.50 per item For hoodies: Gross profit per item = $7,536 / 2 items = $3,768 per item So, the gross profit per item for t-shirts is $47.50, and the gross profit per item for hoodies is $3,768.
Response:  We know that there are 177 shirts and 23 jerseys for sale at $240 per shirt and $210 per jersey. To find out how much more it costs to buy a jersey compared to a shirt, we need to subtract the cost of a shirt from the cost of a jersey.   Cost of a jersey - Cost of a shirt = $210 - $240 = $30 less than buying a shirt So, if you want to buy a jersey instead of a shirt, you would save $30.
Response:  We know that there are 113 shirts sold for $25 each and 78 jerseys sold for $115 each. To find out how much revenue is generated from selling these items, we need to multiply the number of items sold by their respective prices. For the shirts:  113 x $25 = $2,875 For the jerseys:  78 x $115 = $9,070 Total revenue: $2,875 + $9,070 = $11,945
Response:  Firstly, we know that each set of clothes has 10 pieces. Therefore, if they have 5 sets of clothes, they will have a total of 5 x 10 = 50 pieces of clothing.   However, this is not enough to cover all their needs because they also mentioned having more than 10 pairs of socks and underwear. So let's add some extra pieces for these items as well. For example, if they need 2 pairs of socks and underwear per day, then they will need 2 x 365 = 730 pairs of socks and underwear in total (assuming they wear them every day). Adding this number to the previous total gives us: 50 + 730 = 880 pieces of clothing.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two sets of 12 eggs each in the basket.  Therefore, the total number of eggs is 2 x 12 = 24 eggs.   Now, let's consider how many eggs are left after the first set of 12 eggs is taken away.  We have 24 - 12 = 12 eggs remaining.  Finally, we need to divide these 12 eggs into two equal parts for each set of six eggs.  So, the answer is 12 / 2 = 6 eggs per set.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 chairs in total.  Secondly, each chair has 3 cushions. Therefore, the total number of cushions is 7 x 3 = 21 cushions.   However, it seems like there are too many cushions! Let's check again. We can see that some cushions have been placed twice. So, we need to subtract the doubled cushions from the total number of cushions. There are 4 pairs of identical cushions, and each pair consists of two cushions. Therefore, we can subtract 4 x 2 = 8 cushions from the total number of cushions. Now, let's calculate the final answer: 21 - 8 = 13 cushions. Finally, there are 13 cushions in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 sets of chairs in total. Each set has 13 chairs, so we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows:  11 x 13 = 143 chairs. Therefore, there are 143 chairs in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 sets of clothes in total and each set has 6 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is 10 x 6 = 60. Now, if there are 11 people sitting down, we need to find out how many sets of clothes they will wear. Since there are 11 people and each set has 6 pieces, we can divide 11 by 6 to get the number of sets: 11 / 6 = 1 remainder 5. So, 11 people will wear 1 complete set of clothes with 5 extra pieces left over.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 sets of chopsticks in total and each set has 14 sticks. Therefore, the total number of chopsticks is:  12 x 14 = 168 chopsticks. However, there are still 6 extra pairs of chopsticks left over, so the final answer would be:  168 + 6 = 174 chopsticks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four sets of clothes for each person in total, and each set has three pieces (top, bottom, and socks). Therefore, the total number of items needed is:  4 x 3 = 12  So, they need to buy 12 more pairs of socks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 chairs in total (5 for the family and 2 for the guests).  Next, we can see that each chair has a different color, so let's assign a number to each color.  1. Red - 3 chairs (the father, mother, and daughter) 2. Blue - 2 chairs (the son and the guest) 3. Green - 1 chair (the other guest) Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes each person will wear.  The father will wear 1 pair of black shoes.  The mother will wear 1 pair of brown shoes.  The daughter will wear 2 pairs of shoes (one black and one white).  The son will wear 2 pairs of shoes (one blue and one red).  The first guest will wear 1 pair of green shoes, and the second guest will wear 1 pair of yellow shoes.  Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 pairs of shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Liwis will receive per week if she receives $460 in total over 5 weeks. To do this, we can divide the total amount received ($460) by the number of weeks (5): Weekly earnings = Total amount / Number of weeks Weekly earnings = $460 / 5 Weekly earnings = $92 So, Liwis will receive $92 per week for 5 weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Liwis received 1216 baht in total for her work during the internship period. Secondly, she received 16 baht per week for her work. Therefore, to find out how many weeks Liwis worked, we can divide the total amount she received (1216) by the amount she received per week (16): 1216 / 16 = 75.83 weeks So, Liwis worked for approximately 75.83 weeks during her internship period.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Liwis received 21 dollars per week for 216 weeks, which is equal to 4,320 dollars in total (21 x 216 = 4,320). If he has to pay taxes of 702 dollars, how much money will he have left after paying the taxes?   Solution: To find out how much money Liwis will have left after paying the taxes, we need to subtract the amount of taxes from the total amount he received. Therefore, the calculation is as follows: 4,320 - 702 = 3,618. So, Liwis will have 3,618 dollars left after paying the taxes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Li will receive per month if she works for 73 months (6 years).   Monthly income = Total amount / Number of months  = 1357 dollars / 223 months  = 608 dollars per month Now, let's calculate how much money Li will receive in total if she works for 6 years (73 months):  Total amount = Monthly income x Number of months  = 608 dollars x 73 months  = 44,344 dollars So, Li will receive $44,344 if she works for 6 years (73 months) at $608 per month.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Liwis received 28 dollars per week for 1091 weeks, which is equal to 28 x 1091 = 31,568 dollars.   Secondly, we know that Liwis worked part-time during his college years and received 939 dollars per week for those 4 years, which is equal to 939 x 4 = 37,560 dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money Liwis received during his college years is 31,568 + 37,560 = 69,128 dollars.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Liwis received 403 dollars per week for 233 weeks, which is equal to:  

403 x 233 = 91,590 dollars 

Now, if he had to pay rent of 49 dollars per week for the same period, we can calculate how much he would have paid in total as follows:  

49 x 233 = 11,377 dollars 

So, the total amount Liwis would have received during those 233 weeks is:  

91,590 - 11,377 = 80,213 dollars"
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much rent he needs to pay per month based on the given information. To do this, we can use the following formula: Rent = Total amount of money received / Number of months he lived there. In this case, the total amount of money received is 368 dollars and the number of months he lived there is 1359 - 388 = 971 months (since he paid 388 dollars in rent for the first 3 months). Therefore, the rent he needs to pay per month is: Rent = 368 / 971 = approximately 0.38 dollars per month.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Liwis received 491 dollars per week for 1181 weeks, which is equal to:  

491 x 1181 = 573,091 dollars 

Now, if he had to pay rent of 216 dollars per week for 1181 weeks, we can calculate how much money he would have left as follows:  

216 x 1181 = 253,516 dollars 

So, Liwis would have 573,091 - 253,516 = 319,575 dollars left after paying rent for 1181 weeks."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Li has received 133 dollars in total over 19 weeks. So, to find out how much she receives per week, let's divide the total amount by the number of weeks: 133 / 19 = 7.00 dollars per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Liwis received 2 dollars per week for 178 weeks, so she received a total of:  2 x 178 = 356 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that the height of the water in the bucket is 10 feet (as given).  Next, we know that the boy can lift 9 feet of water with his hand (also given).  So, if we subtract the amount that the boy can lift from the total height of the water, we get:  10 - 9 = 1 foot.  Therefore, the remaining height of the water after the boy has lifted some of it is 1 foot.
Response:  First, we know that the height of the water in the bucket is 8 feet.  Second, we know that the height of the water in the well is 14 feet. Third, we want to find out how much higher the water in the well is compared to the water in the bucket. To do this, we can subtract the height of the water in the bucket from the height of the water in the well:  14 - 8 =?  The answer is 6 feet. So, the water in the well is 6 feet higher than the water in the bucket.
Response:  First, we know that the height of the water in the bucket is 11 feet (as given in the problem).  Next, we need to find out how much water is needed to fill the well if it has a diameter of 12 feet and a depth of 5 times the height of the water in the bucket.  To do this, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.  Since the diameter of the well is 12 feet, half of that is the radius: r = 6 feet.  Now we can plug in the values we have found into the formula: V = π(6)^2(11) = 33π cubic feet.  So, there are 33π cubic feet of water needed to fill the well if it has a diameter of 12 feet and a depth of 5 times the height of the water in the bucket.
Response:  First, we know that the height of the water in the bucket is 15 feet (as given in the problem).  Next, we know that the rope is 4 feet long (also given in the problem).  So, if we subtract the length of the rope from the height of the water, we get:  15 - 4 = 11 feet  Therefore, the amount of water left in the bucket after the rope has been pulled up is 11 feet.
Response:  First, we know that the height of the water in the bucket is 16 feet (as given in the problem). Next, we need to find out how much of this height is due to the depth of the well and how much is due to the height of the rock. We can do this by subtracting the depth of the well from the total height of the water in the bucket. So, if the depth of the well is 9 feet (as given in the problem), then the amount of the height due to the rock would be:  16 - 9 = 7 feet  Therefore, the height of the rock above the ground level is 7 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the water is 9 times the height of the deck. So if the height of the deck is x feet, then the height of the water is 9x feet. Secondly, we are given that the depth of the water is 15 - 6 = 9 feet. Therefore, the total volume of water in the pool is 9x x 9 = 81x cubic feet. Now, we need to find out what value of x makes the volume of water equal to 81x cubic feet. To do this, we can set up the equation:  81x = 9x x 9 = 810x. Solving for x, we get:  x = 810/9 = 90 feet. Therefore, the height of the deck is 90 feet.
Response:  If there are 34 pages in total and each book has 2 volumes, then there must be 17 pages in each volume (34 / 2 = 17).   Therefore, there are 17 pages of comics in each book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of chapters in each volume is 2. Therefore, if there are 42 volumes, the total number of chapters would be:  42 x 2 = 84 chapters.  Next, we need to find out how many levels or tiers there are in each chapter. We can deduce from the information given that there are 2 levels in each chapter. So, the total number of levels in all 84 chapters would be:  84 x 2 = 168 levels.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of pages in each volume is given as 27 for the first volume and 80 for the second volume. Next, we are told that there are 23 volumes in total. So, to find out how many pages in total, we need to multiply the number of pages in each volume by the number of volumes. Therefore, the total number of pages is:  27 x 23 = 611 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of notebooks (n) = 9 (given). Secondly, we know that the number of pages in each notebook (m) = 46 (given). Finally, we want to find out the total number of pages (T) that the person has. Therefore, we can use the formula: T = n x m = 9 x 46 = 354 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pim has 23 notebooks and each notebook contains 61 pages. So, in total, she has 23 x 61 = 1403 pages of handwritten notes. However, there are some blank pages in each notebook, so let's assume that each notebook has an average of 5 blank pages (this is just an estimate). Therefore, the total number of pages with content would be: 1403 - (23 x 5) = 1403 - 115 = 1288 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 tubes of notebooks in total. Secondly, each tube contains an equal number of notebooks, which is 28 pages per tube. Therefore, to find out how many pages of notebooks does he have in total, we need to multiply the number of tubes by the number of pages in each tube.  So, the calculation would be: Total pages = Number of tubes x Number of pages per tube  Total pages = 7 x 28  Total pages = 196 pages  There are 196 pages of notebooks in total.
Response:  If there are 38 pages in total and each page has two lines of text, then there would be 38 x 2 = 76 lines of text in total.   Therefore, if the student has all 38 pages, they have 76 lines of text to review for their exam.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many invitation cards are needed for each guest.  We can assume that each guest will receive one invitation card. Therefore, the total number of invitation cards required is equal to the number of guests attending the event. In this case, there will be 5 guests attending the event, so we need 5 invitation cards.
Response:  Firstly, there are 12 people in total who will receive invitations.  Secondly, each person will receive 3 invitations.  Therefore, the total number of invitations is 12 x 3 = 36 invitations.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 invitation cards in total. Secondly, each pack of invitation cards contains 7 cards. Therefore, to calculate how many packs of invitation cards she needs to buy, we can divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per pack: 10 / 7 = 1 pack + remainder (since 10 cannot be divided exactly by 7). The remainder is 3. So, she needs to buy 1 pack and 3 additional cards.
Response:  Firstly, she bought 14 invitation cards and 6 packs of gifts, so she has in total: 14 + 6 = 20 items.  Secondly, she bought an additional 11 packs of invitation cards, so she has in total: 20 + 11 = 31 items.  Therefore, she can invite 31 people to her party.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each invitation card costs 30 baht and there are 9 friends to be invited. So, the total cost of all invitation cards is:  9 x 30 = 270 baht.  Next, we need to calculate how many additional packs of invitation cards need to be purchased if she wants to give each friend an extra pack as a gift. Since each pack contains 2 cards, we can calculate the number of packs needed as follows:  270 / 2 = 135 packs (rounded up) Therefore, our final answer is:  135 packs of invitation cards need to be purchased in addition to the 3 packs already bought.
Response:  If she can make 12 candles in each game and play for 3 games, then she will have made a total of 12 x 3 = 36 candles.   Therefore, if she plays 4 games, she will have made a total of 36 + 36 = 72 candles.
Response:  We know that Melissa can play each game for 3 hours and she has 81 hours in total to spend playing all three games. To find out how many hours she spends on each game, we need to divide her total number of hours by the number of games she plays. So, we have:  81 hours / 3 games =?  Now, we need to simplify this fraction. Can you do it for us?
Response:  Firstly, we know that she has received bonuses of 82 coins in each game, so the total number of coins she has received is 82 x 79 = 6438 coins. Now, let's calculate how many coins she will have if she plays all 109 games. We can do this by adding the total number of coins she has received to the number of coins she started with (500). So, the final answer is:  500 + 6438 = 7038 coins.
Response:  If she can make 7 candles in each game and play 21 games in total, then she will have made a total of 7 x 21 = 147 candles.
Response:  We know that Melissa can make 91 candies in total and she has made some candies in each game. So we need to find out how many candies she has made in each game.  We are given that she has played 13 games and each game takes her 2 hours to complete. Therefore, she has spent 2 x 13 = 26 hours playing all the games. Since she makes 50 candies per hour, she has made a total of  26 x 50 = 1300 candies. But we know that she has already made 91 candies, so the number of candies she has left is  1300 - 91 = 1209.  Therefore, the average number of candies Melissa has made in each game is  1209 / 13 = 92.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four places to sit in the garden (A, B, C, and D). Secondly, each place can accommodate up to 20 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can be seated in all four places is:  4 x 20 = 80 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 people who can sit in the first row of benches.  Each person takes up one space, so there are 9 spaces available for sitting.   Secondly, we know that there are 18 people in total, including those who will be standing.  We need to find out how many people can stand in the back row of benches.  To do this, we subtract the number of people who can sit in the front row from the total number of people (18).  This gives us:  18 - 9 = 9  So, there are 9 people who can stand in the back row of benches.  In summary, there are 9 people who can sit in the front row and 9 people who can stand in the back row, making a total of 18 people who can fit in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each car can accommodate 4 people, so if there are 19 cars, it means there are 19 x 4 = 76 seats in total.  Now, we need to find out how many people can be seated in all the cars combined. Since each car can seat 4 people, we can divide the total number of seats (76) by 4 to get the maximum number of people who can be seated:  76 / 4 = 19 Therefore, up to 19 people can be seated in all the cars combined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 people in total and each group can accommodate 15 people. So, if we have x groups of people, we will have:  18 / 15 = x  To find out how many groups of people we need to make up 10 extra people, we can divide the number of extra people (10) by the number of people per group (15):  10 / 15 = x - 1 Since we want to round down to the nearest whole number, we can simply take the integer part of this result:  x - 1 = 6  Therefore, we need 6 groups of 15 people each to accommodate all 10 extra people.  In summary, we need 6 groups of 15 people each to accommodate all 18 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are six seats in total and each seat can accommodate three people. Therefore, if we have x people sitting down, then we can represent this as follows:  3x = 18 (since each seat has three people) Now, we want to find out how many more people can be seated if we add an additional four people to the current number of people. So, let's calculate:  If we add four people to x, we get: 3x + 4 =? To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: 3x + 4 - 4 = 3x - 4 Now, we have: 3x = 12 (since each seat has three people) Therefore, if we start with x people, we can seat a total of 12 people (including the original x people). However, since we added four people, the new total is 16 people (including all 12 original people and the additional four people). So, the answer is: There will be 4 more people who can be seated if we add an additional four people to the current number of people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two small tables (A and B) with a capacity of 4 people each, and one large table (C) with a capacity of 8 people.  Total number of people that can be seated at all three tables = 2 x 4 + 8 = 20 + 8 = 28 people.   Therefore, the maximum number of people who can enjoy the buffet is 28.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 small tables and 7 large tables in total.  Secondly, each small table can seat 4 people, so 3 small tables can seat 3 x 4 = 12 people. Thirdly, each large table can seat 8 people, so 7 large tables can seat 7 x 8 = 56 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can be seated in all the tables is 12 + 56 = 68 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 people in total who can fit into the amusement park. Secondly, each ride can accommodate 4 people at a time. Therefore, to determine how many rides are needed to accommodate all 16 people, we need to divide 16 by 4.  16 ÷ 4 = 4 So, 4 rides are needed to accommodate all 16 people.
Response:  We know that there are 4 people in total who can go to the amusement park together. If we divide them into groups of 2, we have:  2 + 2 = 4  Therefore, there are 4 possible combinations of two-person groups that can go to the amusement park together.
Response:  We have 7 orchards with equal areas (A). Each orchard has 14 plots of land (B). So we can write: A = B x 7 Since each plot is equal in size, we know that A = B Therefore, we can solve for B: B = A / 7 Now we can substitute values to find out how many plots are in each orchard: B = 14 / 7 = 2 plots per orchard Thus, there will be 2 plots of land in each of the 7 orchards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 chips in total. Secondly, each chip has two sides, so there are altogether 28 x 2 = 56 sides to choose from. Finally, since we want to select two chips, we need to choose two out of these 56 sides. Therefore, the number of possible combinations is C(56, 2) = 56 x 55 / 2 = 140. So, there are 140 ways to select two chips from the bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each floor has four slides. Therefore, if we have 17 floors in total, we will have 17 x 4 = 68 slides in total. Now, since there are 25 people in total, we need to divide the number of slides among them equally. One way to do this is to divide 68 by 25 to get an average of 2.72 slides per person. Since we cannot have a fraction of a slide, let's round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 3 slides per person. So, in total, there will be 3 x 25 = 75 slides available for all 25 people.
Response:  Firstly, we have 9 officers and each officer has 10 cards. So, in total, there are 9 x 10 = 90 cards. Now, if we divide these cards equally among 2 people, each person will get half of the total number of cards, which is 90 / 2 = 45 cards. Therefore, each person will have 45 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 45 rows of trees in total. Secondly, each row has 10 bottles of pesticides. Therefore, to calculate the total number of bottles of pesticides used for all rows, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of bottles per row. So, the calculation is as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of rows x Number of bottles per row Total number of bottles = 45 x 10 Total number of bottles = 450 bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 45 ml of milk in total and we need to divide it equally among 9 bottles. So, if we divide 45 ml by 9, we get approximately 5 ml per bottle (45 ml ÷ 9 = 5 ml). Therefore, each bottle will contain 5 ml of milk.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 employees in total and they will be divided into groups of 12 employees each. So, the number of groups is:  36 / 12 = 3 Therefore, there will be 3 groups of employees. Next, we need to find out how many floors each group will have to water. We know that each floor needs 58 liters of water, so we can calculate as follows:  3 x 58 = 174 liters In conclusion, all 3 groups of employees will need to water a total of 174 liters of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 55 elephants in total. Secondly, each elephant consumes 15 bags of fertilizer per day. Therefore, the total amount of fertilizer consumed daily is 55 x 15 = 825 bags. Lastly, since there are only 60 days for the elephants to consume the fertilizer before they finish their task, then the total number of bags of fertilizer needed would be 825 x 60 = 49,500 bags. So, the answer is 49,500 bags of fertilizer.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 ml of milk in each bottle. Secondly, we know that there are 60 ml of milk in total. Finally, we can calculate how many bottles of milk are needed to make up 60 ml. To do this, we divide the total amount of milk (60 ml) by the amount of milk in one bottle (10 ml): 60 ml / 10 ml = 6 bottles. Therefore, there will be 6 bottles of milk.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 rows of trees in total and each row has 4 trees.  Therefore, the total number of trees is 8 x 4 = 32 trees.   Now, let's consider how many lemons each tree can produce. We are given that the average yield per tree is 32 lemons. So, if we divide 32 by 8 (the number of rows), we get:  Each tree produces 32 / 8 = 4 lemons per tree.  Finally, to find out how many lemons each row produces, we multiply the number of trees in each row by the number of lemons each tree produces:  Row 1: 4 x 4 = 16 lemons Row 2: 4 x 4 = 16 lemons... Row 8: 4 x 4 = 16 lemons Total: 16 + 16 +... + 16 = 128 lemons
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 people in total who will receive the snacks. Secondly, each person will receive 2 snacks. Therefore, the total number of snacks needed is 11 x 2 = 22 snacks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mat has 8 pieces of candy to share among his friends. If he gives 2 pieces to each friend, how many friends can he give candy to?  2 x 8 = 16 So, Mat can give candy to 16 friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 pieces of candy in total. Secondly, we know that each friend will receive 5 pieces of candy. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy left over is:  15 - (5 x 5) = 15 - 25 = 10. So, each friend will get 5 pieces of candy, and there will be 10 pieces of candy leftover.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 pieces of candy in total. Secondly, we know that 3 friends will share the candy equally among themselves. Therefore, each friend will receive 24/3 = 8 pieces of candy. Finally, we have 24 - 8 = 16 remaining candies left over after sharing with the three friends. So, the number of candies leftover is 16.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 pieces of candy and 34 pieces in total. Secondly, we have to divide these candies equally among 11 people. So, if we divide 22 by 11, we get 2 (remainder 1). And if we divide 34 by 11, we also get 3 (remainder 1). Therefore, each person will receive 2 + 3 = 5 pieces of candy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 29 pieces of candy and 30 pieces of snacks in total. Secondly, we need to divide these candies and snacks equally among two people. Finally, we want to find out how many pieces each person will get. To do this, we can use division. So let's start with the total number of items: 29 + 30 = 69. Now, let's divide 69 by 2: 69 ÷ 2 = 34.5 (since we cannot have half a piece, we will round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, each person will receive approximately 35 pieces of candy and snacks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 types of snacks and 21 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide these snacks and chocolates equally among 7 people. To do this, we can use division.  14 (snacks) / 7 (people) = x (number of snacks per person)  Similarly, 21 (chocolates) / 7 (people) = y (number of chocolates per person) Now we have two equations: x + y = 14... 30 (since each snack has 2 chocolates) x + y = 21 We can solve these equations simultaneously to find x and y. Solving for x first, we get: x = 2 So, each person will receive 2 snacks. Now, let's solve for y: y = 19 Since each person receives 2 snacks and each snack has 2 chocolates, each person will receive 19 chocolates in total. Therefore, if you share 14 types of snacks and 21 pieces of chocolate with 7 friends, each friend will receive 2 snacks and 19 chocolates.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 people in total and each person will receive 36 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 18 x 36 = 648 cookies.  
Now, let's divide the total number of cookies among the 18 people equally. We can do this by dividing 648 by 18 to get the average number of cookies per person: 648 / 18 = 35.56 (rounded up to the nearest whole number) Therefore, each person will receive approximately 36 cookies."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each person will receive 6 types of snacks. So, if there are 36 snacks in total, and each person receives 6 snacks, then the number of people who can receive these snacks is:  36 / 6 = 6 people.
Response:  First, we know that there are 23 pieces of candy in total.  Second, we know that each person gets an equal number of candies.  Finally, we want to find out how many candies each person will get if they divide the 23 pieces equally among themselves.   To solve this problem, we can use division.  If we divide 23 by 2 (since there are two people), we get: 23 ÷ 2 = 11   So, each person will get 11 pieces of candy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 pieces of candy in total. Secondly, Matithiw has given 5 people an equal amount of candies, so each person received 6 (31/5) pieces of candy. Therefore, Matithiw has 23 pieces of candy left (31 - 5 x 6 = 23).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 32 types of snacks and each type has 98 pieces. So, in total, there are  32 x 98 = 3176 pieces of snacks. Now, let's consider how many pieces each person will get if they eat one piece from each type of snack. Since there are 4 people eating together, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4 to find out how many pieces each person will get. Therefore, each person will get  3176 / 4 = 794 pieces of snacks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 types of snacks in total.  Secondly, each type of snack has 8 servings per container.  Therefore, if we divide 10 by 8, we get 1.25 containers needed for each person to try all 10 types of snacks.   However, since we want each person to have an equal amount of each type of snack, let's round up to the nearest whole number. So, we need 2 containers (10/8 = 1.25 rounded up to 2) for each person to try all 10 types of snacks.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 people in total and each person will receive 13 types of snacks and drinks. So, the total number of items given to each person is 13 x 28 = 364 items. Now, let's consider the number of chopsticks needed for each person. Since there are 15 chopsticks per set, and each person will need one set, the total number of chopsticks required is 28 x 15 = 420 chopsticks. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many chopsticks and snacks/drinks will be given to 28 people?"" is: Chopsticks: 420 Snacks/Drinks: 364"
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of each kilogram of rice has decreased from 109 baht to 74 baht. This means that for every kilogram of rice, there is a decrease of 35 baht (109 - 74 = 35). Now, let's calculate how much rice Thanaporn can buy with her original budget of 109 baht per kilogram. We know that she wants to buy 74 kilograms of rice. So, if we multiply 74 kilograms by the old price of 109 baht per kilogram, we get: 74 kg x 109 baht/kg = 7,866 baht. Now, since the new price of rice is 74 baht per kilogram, we can calculate how much rice Thanaporn can buy with her original budget as follows: 7,866 baht / 74 baht/kg = 106 kg. Therefore, Thanaporn can buy 106 kilograms of rice with her original budget of 109 baht per kilogram.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 153 days in total and each day has 24 hours. So, if she uses the water for 17 hours per day, she will use it for 153 x 24 = 3672 hours. Now, let's calculate how many showers she can take in 17 hours. We know that a standard shower lasts around 10 minutes (assuming 2 gallons of water used per minute). So, in 17 hours, she can have  17 x 60 = 1020 showers. Therefore, she can take approximately 1020 showers in 153 days if she uses the water for 17 hours per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 264 days in the year and the price of each day is 15 baht. So, if she spends 11 days, the total cost would be:  264 x 15 = 3960 baht.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of water decreases by 301 baht per cubic meter when there is a sale. Secondly, we are given that the amount of water consumed in one day is 144 cubic meters. Thirdly, if the customer continues to consume the same amount of water for another 157 days (since the last sale), then the total amount of water consumed during this period would be:  144 x 157 = 22,696 cubic meters. Finally, we can calculate the total cost of water consumption during this period as follows:  22,696 x 301 = 68,239 baht. So, the total cost of water consumption for 157 days at the discounted price of 301 baht per cubic meter would be 68,239 baht.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 88 water droplets and 13 soap droplets in total. If 4 water droplets and 87 soap droplets were removed, we need to find out how many days it would take for the remaining droplets to fill up the container again.   To do this, we can use the formula: Total number of droplets = (Initial number of droplets - Removed droplets) / Daily increase.  In our case, the initial number of droplets is 88 + 13 = 101. The removed droplets are 4 + 87 = 91. So, the daily increase is:   Daily increase = (Total number of droplets - Initial number of droplets) / Number of days.  Substituting the values, we get:   Daily increase = (101 - 101) / 91 = 0.011111... (repeating). This means that one droplet will be added every 91 days. Therefore, if 4 water droplets and 87 soap droplets were removed, it would take approximately 91 x 4 = 364 days for the remaining droplets to fill up the container again.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 200 bottles of water and 256 cans of soda in total.  If each bottle of water costs 312 baht and each can of soda costs 4 baht, then the total cost would be:  200 x 312 = 62,400 baht + 256 x 4 = 1,024 baht = 63,424 baht.  Now, if we want to calculate how many days the money will last for, we need to divide the total cost by the daily expenditure. So, let's say we spend 400 baht per day (this is just an example). Then, we can calculate as follows:  63,424 baht / 400 baht/day = 158.56 days. Therefore, based on these calculations, our money will last for approximately 158.56 days or about 5 months and 1.5 weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that she drinks 6 glasses of water per day and each glass contains 8 ounces (250 ml) of water. So, in total, she consumes 6 x 8 = 48 ounces (1.3 liters) of water daily. Now, if she buys 12 bottles of water, each containing 1 liter of water, then she will consume 12 x 1 = 12 liters of water. Since she already consumes 1.3 liters daily, adding 12 liters from the bought water means she will have consumed a total of 1.3 + 12 = 13.3 liters of water. Therefore, based on her current consumption rate, she can last for approximately 13.3 / 48 = 2.75 days or around 3 days before running out of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 95 degrees Celsius in boiling water and 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, let's convert 15 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit:  15°C × 9/5 = 60°F Next, we need to find out how many days it would take for the water to cool down from 60°F to 54°F. We can use the formula: Time = (Temperature difference) / (Cooling rate) Here, the temperature difference is 60 - 54 = 6 degrees Fahrenheit, and the cooling rate is 1 degree per day. Therefore, Time = (6) / (1) = 6 days So, it would take 6 days for the water to cool down from 60°F to 54°F.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 360 degrees in a full circle and 162 degrees of water in the bucket. So, if we subtract the amount of water in the bucket from 360 degrees, we get:  360 - 162 = 198 degrees left to fill the bucket. Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for the water to overflow based on the daily usage of 9 buckets per day:  198 / 9 = 22 days (approximately) Therefore, it will take approximately 22 days for the water to overflow the bucket if the daily usage remains constant at 9 buckets per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 boxes in total and each box contains 11 dinosaurs. Therefore, to find out how many dinosaurs Thao has in total, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of dinosaurs in each box. So, the calculation is as follows:  14 x 11 = 154  Therefore, Thao has 154 dinosaurs in total.
"Response:  There are 12 dinosaurs in total, and they are divided into 3 groups of 4 dinosaurs each. So, there are 4 dinosaurs in each group.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 dinosaurs in each row of the array.  Secondly, we know that there are 28 rows in total.  Therefore, to calculate how many arrays Thao can make, we need to multiply the number of dinosaurs in each row by the number of rows.  So, if we multiply 16 x 28, we get... (wait for it)... 448!  That's right, Thao can make 448 arrays with her 28 rows and 16 dinosaurs per row.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 dinosaurs in each row of the toy set.  Secondly, we know that there are 6 rows in total.  Therefore, the total number of dinosaurs is:  22 x 6 = 132 dinosaurs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 types of soil in the garden, and each type has 35 plants. Therefore, the total number of plants in the garden is 5 x 35 = 175 plants.  Now, let's consider the colorful flowers. We have 7 types of colorful flowers, and each type has 35 plants as well. So, the total number of colorful flowers in the garden is 7 x 35 = 245 plants. In total, there are 175 + 245 = 420 plants in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 total wells in the area.   Secondly, we know that there are 4 deep wells and 27 shallow wells. Therefore, to find out how many deep wells there are per 19 wells, we can divide 4 (the number of deep wells) by 19 (the total number of wells): 4/19 = 0.21 or approximately 21%. So, there are 21% deep wells among the 19 wells.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 trees in total, and each tree has 30 branches. So, to find out how many branches there are in total, we can multiply 36 (trees) x 30 (branches per tree). Therefore, the total number of branches is:  36 x 30 = 1080 branches.
Response:  Firstly, we have 11 pieces of wood in total.   Secondly, there are 31 wooden sticks that are not painted and 27 painted wooden sticks. Therefore, the total number of wooden sticks is:  31 + 27 = 58 wooden sticks.
Response:  We have 30 dinosaurs in total and each swamp has 5 dinosaurs. So we can make:  30 / 5 = 6 groups of dinosaurs.
Response:  If there are 6 dinosaurs in total and 2 groups of dinosaurs, then each group has 3 dinosaurs.   Therefore, if one group has 3 dinosaurs, the other group also has 3 dinosaurs.  So, in total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 dinosaurs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each pack has 4 dinosaurs and there are 35 packs in total. Therefore, the total number of dinosaurs is 35 x 4 = 140. Now, we need to find out how many groups of 2 dinosaurs can be formed from these 140 dinosaurs. We can do this by dividing 140 by 2, which gives us: 140 / 2 = 70. So, our answer is 70. Our friend can make 70 groups of 2 dinosaurs using all the dinosaurs she has.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 packets in total and each packet has 6 dinosaurs. Therefore, the total number of dinosaurs is 31 x 6 = 186 dinosaurs. However, we also know that there are 19 dinosaurs in each row, so the total number of rows is 186 / 19 = 10 rows. Finally, we can conclude that there are 10 rows of dinosaurs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 rows in total and each row has 71 square meters of land. So, to find out how many square meters of land there are in total, we can multiply the number of rows by the area of one row: Total area = Number of rows x Area per row Total area = 30 x 71 Total area = 2130 square meters Therefore, there are 2130 square meters of land in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 boxes in total and each box contains either 6 or 21 marbles. So, let's start by finding out how many boxes contain 6 marbles. We can do this by dividing 16 by 6, which gives us: 16 / 6 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 boxes that contain 6 marbles each. Next, we need to find out how many boxes contain 21 marbles. We can do this by dividing 16 by 21, which gives us: 16 / 21 = 0 With rounding, there are 0 boxes that contain 21 marbles. So, in total, there are 2 boxes with 6 marbles each and no boxes with 21 marbles. The number of marbles that Thai has is: 2 x 6 = 12 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 98 students, so the total number of students in the school is 21 x 98 = 2088 students. Secondly, we know that there are 7 teachers in the school, so the number of teachers per classroom is 7/21 = 0.33 (or approximately 1 teacher for every 3 classrooms). Therefore, the number of teachers who will be standing in the playground at any given time is 0.33 x 21 = 6.99 (or approximately 7) teachers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 84 classrooms in total. Next, we need to find out how many students can sit in each classroom. We are given that there are 95 computers and 118 chairs in total. So, let's assume that one computer is used for every four chairs (since there are 23 chairs per row). Therefore, we can calculate the number of classes as follows:   Number of classes = Total number of classrooms / Number of classes per row  = 84 / 4  = 21 rows of classes  Now, we need to find out how many students can attend each row of classes. Since there are 118 chairs per row, we can calculate the total number of students as follows:  Total number of students = Number of chairs per row x Number of rows of classes  = 118 x 21  = 2478 students  Finally, we add up all these numbers to get the grand total:  Grand total = Total number of classes x Total number of students per class  = 21 x 2478  = 50,680 students  There are approximately 50,680 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 67 classrooms in total and each classroom has 66 students, so the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4322 students. Secondly, if there are 6 designated parking spots for cars, then the remaining 6 - 6 = 0 spots can be used for other vehicles such as buses or vans. Therefore, the maximum number of vehicles that can park in the school compound is 0 + 6 = 6 vehicles.   Finally, to calculate the minimum number of drivers needed to transport all 4322 students and 6 staff members, we need to divide the total number of passengers by the capacity of each vehicle. Since each car can accommodate 6 people, we can divide 4322 / 6 = 720 passengers by 6 = 120 trips. So, at least 120 drivers would be needed to transport everyone.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students, which is 58 people. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 87 x 58 = 5,046 people. Now, let's consider how many buses are needed to transport these students for the field trip. We need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus, which is 2 people per bus. So, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:  5,046 / 2 = 2,523 buses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 classrooms in total and each classroom has an equal number of students (120/24 = 5). Therefore, each classroom has 5 students. Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. We can do this by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom: Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Number of students per classroom Total number of students = 24 x 5 Total number of students = 120 So, there are 120 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 66 classrooms in total and each classroom has 22 students, so the total number of students is:  66 x 22 = 1432 students.  Next, we know that there are 8 buses available for transportation, and each bus can accommodate 22 students, so the total number of trips required to transport all the students is:  8 x 22 = 176 trips.  However, since some students do not want to go on the trip, we need to subtract the number of students who will not participate from the total number of trips required. In this case, if 22 students do not want to go on the trip, we need to subtract:  176 - 22 = 154 trips.  Therefore, the number of buses needed to transport all the students (including those who do not want to go) is:  154 trips.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 students in total and each student takes up one seat. Therefore, if 8 students do not want to go on the trip, then the number of students who will be going on the trip is:  11 - 8 = 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 72 classrooms in total and each classroom has three seats. Therefore, the total number of seats is 72 x 3 = 216 seats. Now, we need to find out how many buses are needed if all 111 students attend school. To do this, we can divide the total number of seats (216) by the number of students attending school (111). This gives us:  216 / 111 = 1.94 buses So, approximately 2 buses would be needed to transport all 111 students to school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 46 students, so the total number of students is 17 x 46 = 802 students.   Secondly, if there are 92 students in total, then the remaining number of students who have not been assigned to any classroom yet would be 92 - 802 = 730 students. Therefore, there will be 730 students sitting in the auditorium.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 boys in total and each boy is given 9 balls of candy. So, if we multiply 11 (boys) x 9 (balls per boy), we get:  
11 x 9 = 99 balls of candy in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 kids in total who like to play with the elephant. Secondly, the elephant gives 5 kids each a ride. Therefore, the number of kids who get a ride from the elephant is 5 x 2 = 10. So, the total number of kids who get a ride from the elephant is 10.
Response:  Firstly, there are 4 children in the group. Secondly, each child can only hold 3 balloons at most. Therefore, the total number of balloons that all four children can hold is 4 x 3 = 12. Now, we need to distribute these 12 balloons among the 23 children. Since we want each child to receive at least one balloon, we will divide the 12 balloons equally among the 23 children. So, each child will receive 12 / 23 = 1/2 balloon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 boys who like to play merry-go-round and 50 boys who like to play card games. So, in total, there are 13 + 50 = 63 boys. Now, if each boy gets to play for 26 rounds of merry-go-round, then the number of rounds each boy will get to play is 63 / 26 = 2.4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a round, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 rounds per boy. Therefore, each boy will get to play 3 rounds of merry-go-round.
Response:  Firstly, there are 20 children in the classroom, and each child has 2 friends who like to play with them. So, in total, there are 2 x 20 = 40 children who have at least one friend who likes to play with them.   However, some of these children may have more than two friends, so we need to subtract those who have only one friend from the total number of children who have at least one friend. To do this, we can use the fact that there are 19 other children in the classroom besides the speaker's two friends (since each of the speaker's friends must be different from the others). Therefore, the number of children who have only one friend is 19 x 2 = 38. Subtracting 38 from 40 gives us the final answer: 40 - 38 = 2. So, the speaker's two friends will receive how many balls? The answer is 2.
Response:  If there are 28 kids in total and each kid gets 2 helium balloons, then the number of pairs of balloons is equal to the number of kids times 2 (since each kid gets two balloons). So, we can write an equation:  28 x 2 =?  Now, let's solve for the unknown variable '?' which represents the number of pairs of balloons.  We know that 28 x 2 = 56, so the answer is 56 pairs of balloons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 392 pages in total and Frank reads 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it takes for Frank to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:  392 pages / 14 pages/day = 28 days (approximately) Therefore, Frank will spend approximately 28 days reading the entire book if he continues at his current pace of 14 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 pages in total. Secondly, we know that it takes 569 days to read all the pages. Now, let's divide the number of pages by the number of days it takes to read them:  22 pages / 569 days =?  Can you solve for the number of pages per day?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 612 pages in total and each page takes 24 minutes to read. So, if we divide 612 by 24, we get:  612 / 24 = 25 Therefore, it would take 25 days to finish reading all 612 pages of the book at a rate of one page per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 555 pages in total and each page has 14 lines of text (including headings). Therefore, to calculate the number of words per page, we need to divide the total number of words by the number of pages.  To do this, we can use the following formula: Total Words / Number of Pages = Words Per Page  Now, let's determine the total number of words in the document. The question states that the document contains 555 pages with 14 lines of text per page, so the total number of words is:  555 x 14 = 7770 words  Next, we need to divide the total number of words by the number of pages to find out the average number of words per page:  7770 / 555 = 14.13 words per page  So, the answer is approximately 14.13 words per page.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 193 pages in total and each page takes approximately 660 minutes to read (based on the given information). Therefore, to calculate how many pages Frong can read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the time he spends reading each day. We are given that Frong spends 6 hours per day reading, which is equivalent to 360 minutes (6 x 60 = 360). Now, let's calculate: Total pages / Reading time per day = 193 pages / 360 minutes = 0.53 pages/minute or 53 pages per hour. So, Frong can read approximately 53 pages per hour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 249 pages in each volume of the book and it takes 3 days to read one volume. So, if we want to calculate how many pages Frong can read in one day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spends reading each volume.  249 pages / 3 days = 83 pages per day. Therefore, Frong can read 83 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 66 pages in each volume of the book and it takes 12 days to read one volume. So, if he reads all six volumes, it will take him 12 x 6 = 72 days to finish reading all the books.   Therefore, if he spends 492 days reading all the books, he must have read 72/492 = 0.15 volumes (rounded to two decimal places).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 112 pages in total and it takes 16 days to finish reading the book. So, if we divide 112 pages by 16 days, we get approximately 7 pages per day. Therefore, the number of pages our friend reads per day is 7 pages.
Response: 1) The number of pages in the book is 576 pages. 2) The person reads 8 pages per day. To find out how many days it takes to finish reading the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the daily page count: 576 pages / 8 pages/day = 72 days Therefore, it will take 72 days to finish reading the entire book if you read 8 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has approximately 450 pages. Therefore, to calculate how many pages Frong will read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spends reading the book. So, let's do this calculation: Total pages = 41 x 450 = 18,950 pages Days spent reading = 30 days To find out how many pages Frong will read per day, we can now divide the total pages by the number of days he spends reading: Daily pages = 18,950 pages / 30 days = 631 pages per day
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three books in total and each book has 594 pages. Secondly, we know that it takes 607 days to read all three books. To find out how many pages are in each book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of books: Total pages = 594 x 3 = 1782 pages. Now, let's calculate how many pages are in each book: Book 1 = Total pages / Number of books = 1782 / 3 = 594 pages per book. Therefore, there are 594 pages in each book.
Response: 1) The book has two parts with 405 pages each. 2) Each part takes 337 days to read (664 days total). To find out how many pages Fred reads per day, we need to divide the number of pages in each part by the number of days it takes to read that part. Part 1: 405 pages / 337 days = 1.2 pages/day Part 2: 405 pages / 337 days = 1.2 pages/day Therefore, Fred reads 1.2 x 2 = 2.4 pages per day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each pack of diapers costs in Thai Baht (THB). We know that there are 3 packs of diapers in total, and each pack contains 48 diapers. So, we can calculate the cost of one pack as follows:   Cost per pack = Total amount / Number of diapers per pack = 120 THB / 48 diapers = 2.5 THB per diaper Now, let's calculate the total cost of all three packs:   Total cost = Number of packs x Cost per pack = 3 x 2.5 THB/diaper = 75 THB Therefore, the total cost of all three packs of diapers is 75 THB.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each pack of diapers. There are 81 diapers in each pack, and the price per diaper is THB 33. So, the total cost of one pack of diapers is:  81 x THB 33 = THB 2694. Now, let's calculate the total cost for 33 packs of diapers:  33 x THB 2694 = THB 87,502. Therefore, the total cost for 33 packs of diapers would be THB 87,502.
Response:  First, we know that each pack of diapers costs 107 baht and there is a discount of 106 baht per pack. So, if we buy 93 packs, we will get a total discount of 93 x 106 = 9842 baht. Therefore, the total cost of buying 93 packs of diapers will be 9842 + 107 x 93 = 107 x 93 = 10051 baht.
Response:  First, we know that each pack of diapers costs 76 baht.  If there is a discount of 25% on each pack, what price will you pay for one pack after the discount?   To find out, we need to calculate (1 - 0.25) x 76 =?  Can you do this calculation and tell me the result?
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money available for spending is 104 dollars. Secondly, each pack of diapers costs 26 dollars. Therefore, to find out how many packs of diapers can be bought with 104 dollars, we divide 104 by 26.  104 ÷ 26 =? The result is... 4! Yes, you heard it right - four packs of diapers can be purchased with 104 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of 28 DVD packs at 100 baht per pack. Total Cost = 28 x 100 = 2,800 baht. Next, we need to calculate the discount percentage for buying 2 packs. Discount Percentage = (2,800 - 2,000) / 2,800 x 100% = 35.71%. Finally, we can calculate the price of each pack after the discount. Price After Discount = 2,000 / (1 - 0.3571) = 1,349.62 baht. So, the price of each DVD pack after the discount is 1,349.62 baht.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 kids in the classroom and they will be divided into groups of 2. So, the number of groups = 18 / 2 = 9. Therefore, there will be 9 groups of 2 kids each.  

Question: What is the total number of kids in all the groups?  Answer: To find the total number of kids in all the groups, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of kids in each group. In this case, the total number of kids in all the groups = 9 x 2 = 18."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 187 pieces of candy in each bag. Secondly, we know that there are 140 bags in total. So, to find out how many candies are in all the bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of pieces of candy in each bag. Therefore, the answer is:  140 x 187 = 25,980 candies.
Response:  First, we know that there are 203 students in total and 63 of them are in Class A. So, the number of students left is 203 - 63 = 140.   Next, we know that each class has 7 or 95 students, so we can set up two equations based on these values: Equation 1: 140 / 7 = x (where x is the number of classes) Equation 2: 140 / 95 = y (where y is the number of classes) Now let's solve for x and y. Using equation 1, we have: 140 / 7 = x x = 20 Therefore, there will be 20 classes with 7 students each. Using equation 2, we have: 140 / 95 = y y = 15 Therefore, there will be 15 classes with 95 students each. Finally, to find out how many students are in each class, we need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class: For Class A (with 7 students): 20 x 7 = 140 For all other classes (with 95 students): 15 x 95 = 1425 Total number of students in all classes: 140 + 1425 = 1565
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 142 students in Class A and 356 students in Class B. Next, we know that each class is divided into groups of 47 and 178 respectively. So, to find out how many students are in each group, we can divide the total number of students in each class by the number of groups.   For Class A: 142 / 47 = 3  For Class B: 356 / 178 = 2 Therefore, there are 3 groups of 47 students in Class A and 2 groups of 178 students in Class B.
Response:  We know that there are 196 compartments in each column of the filing cabinet and we want to find out how many files can fit in each compartment.  To do this, we need to divide the total number of files (392) by the number of compartments in each column (196).  Here's the calculation:  392 / 196 = 2 So, each compartment can hold approximately 2 files.

Response:  First, we know that there are 87 students in the class and each student has 290 pencils to be packed into two boxes. So, the total number of pencils is 87 x 290 = 24,630 pencils.   Next, we need to find out how many pencils can fit in one box. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of boxes we want to make: 24,630 / 2 = 12,315 pencils per box. Finally, we can calculate the size of each box by dividing the number of pencils per box by the number of pencils in a bag: 12,315 / 100 = 123 bags per box. Therefore, each box will contain 123 bags of pencils, with 100 pencils in each bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 384 students in total and they will be divided into groups of 192 students each.   Secondly, since each group has 192 students, there will be 384/192 = 2 groups.  Thirdly, if we divide 384 by 2, we get 192 as the result. Therefore, the number of groups is 2, and the size of each group is 192 students.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 pieces of candy in total and each piece has 19 candies. So, to calculate how many pieces of candy are needed for 19 people, we can divide 19 by 19 (the number of candies in each piece). 19 / 19 = 1 Therefore, we need 1 piece of candy for each person.  
Question: What if there were 20 people instead of 19? Would you still give out only one piece of candy per person?  Answer: No, because then we would not have enough candy for everyone! If there were 20 people, we would need to distribute more than one piece of candy per person. To determine exactly how much more, let's do the same calculation as before: 20 / 19 = 1 + 1 So, we would need two pieces of candy per person."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 people in total and each person has 30 cups of rice. So, the total number of cups of rice is 14 x 30 = 420 cups of rice. Now, if we divide the total number of cups of rice among the 14 people equally, then each person will get:  420 cups of rice / 14 people = 30 cups of rice per person. Therefore, the answer is 30 cups of rice per person.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 people in total and each person has to make 22 chopsticks. So, the total number of chopsticks needed is 5 x 22 = 110 chopsticks. However, since each person can only make 17 chopsticks, we need to find out how many chopsticks each person will have after making them. We can do this by dividing the total number of chopsticks by the number of people: 110 / 5 = 22 chopsticks per person. Therefore, each person will have 22 - 17 = 5 chopsticks left over.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 pieces of candy in total and 10 people will be sharing them equally. So each person will receive 18/10 = 1.8 candies on average. However, since we have only one person who has prepared the candy, we need to adjust the number of candies for each person accordingly. Therefore, each person will receive 1.8 x (10-1) = 1.8 x 9 = 16.2 candies. Since we cannot divide candies into fractional parts, each person will receive 16 candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 pieces of candy in total. Secondly, each person will receive an equal number of candies. Therefore, if we divide 14 by 2 (the number of people), we can find out how many candies each person will receive.  14 / 2 =?  The result is... 7! Each person will receive 7 pieces of candy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 types of candy given to each person. Therefore, if there are x people receiving candies, then each person will receive 2x candies in total. Secondly, we know that the total number of candies given out is 10 chilians (10,000). So, we can set up an equation as follows:  2x = 10,000. Now, let's solve for x. We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:  x = 5,000. Therefore, if there are 5,000 people receiving candies, each person will receive 2x = 10,000 candies in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 42 pieces of candy in total. Secondly, each piece of candy is placed into one of two bags. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy in each bag is half of 42, which is 21. Now, let's consider how many pieces of candy are in each hand. Since each bag contains 21 pieces of candy, and there are two bags, there will be a total of 2 x 21 = 42 pieces of candy in both hands. So, the answer is 42 pieces of candy in both hands.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each bag contains 33 balls.  Secondly, there are 26 bags in total. Therefore, to find out how many balls in total, we multiply 26 x 33 = 858. So, there are 858 balls in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 33 chis in total and 24 of them have fallen into the hole. Therefore, the number of remaining chis is:  33 - 24 = 9  Now, we need to find out how many groups of 9 chis can be formed using all the remaining chis. We can do this by dividing 9 by the number of chis in each group. In this case, we want to divide 9 by 4 (since there are 4 chis in each group). So, we calculate:  9 / 4 = 2  Therefore, there are 2 groups of 9 chis that can be formed using all the remaining chis.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 pieces of fruit in total. Secondly, each piece of fruit has 22 chunks. Therefore, to find out how many bags are needed, we can divide the total number of fruit chunks by the number of chunks per bag. In this case, we have 11 x 22 = 242 chunks. Since each bag contains 20 chunks, we need: 242 / 20 = 12 bags. So, there will be 12 bags of fruit chunks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 bags of candy in total. Secondly, each bag contains the same number of candies, so we can say that there are x candies in each bag. Finally, we know that there are 16 candies in total, so we can set up the equation:  2x = 16. Solving for x, we get:  x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 candies in each bag. Now, let's find out how many candies are in each of the two bags: Bag 1: 8 candies Bag 2: 8 candies To summarize, there are 8 candies in each of the two bags.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 instances of each type of item (i.e., 25 x 14 = 350 items in total). Secondly, since each instance has 14 items, we need to send 350 / 14 = 25 boxes in total. Therefore, the answer is 25 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 boxes in total and each box contains 5 items. Therefore, the total number of items is 10 x 5 = 50 items.   Now, if she has to send 5 boxes, we need to find out how many items she will be sending. Since each box contains 5 items, she will be sending 5 x 5 = 25 items.
Response:  We know that there are 67 water droplets in total and 9 droplets of pure water (no impurities). To find out how many more droplets of pure water we need to add to make it equal to the number of impure water droplets, we can subtract the number of pure water droplets from the total number of water droplets:  67 - 9 = 58 Therefore, we need to add 58 more droplets of pure water to make it equal to the number of impure water droplets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 types of traditional Thai desserts in total.  Of those, 61 types have coconut milk as an ingredient.  So, to find out how many more types of Thai desserts with coconut milk there are compared to traditional ones, we need to subtract the number of traditional Thai desserts from the number of types of Thai desserts with coconut milk.  22 - 61 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 39 (61 - 22).  Therefore, there are 39 more types of Thai desserts with coconut milk than traditional ones.
Response:  Firstly, we have 30 bottles of shampoo with different scents. Each bottle contains 8 ounces (227 grams) of shampoo. Therefore, the total weight of all the shampoos is:  30 x 8 oz = 240 oz or 6.8 liters. Next, we have 41 bars of soap with different fragrances. Each bar weighs 4 ounces (113 grams). So, the total weight of all the soaps is:  41 x 4 oz = 164 oz or 4.5 liters. Finally, we need to add up the weights of both items to get the grand total. Therefore, the answer is:  6.8 + 4.5 = 11.3 liters.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of customers who purchased goods from all three channels (online, offline, and mobile app). Total number of customers = Number of online customers + Number of offline customers + Number of mobile app customers   Next, let's calculate the number of online customers. We know that there were 79 customers who made purchases through the online channel. Therefore, the number of online customers is 79.  Now, let's calculate the number of offline customers. We know that there were 53 customers who made purchases through the offline channel. Therefore, the number of offline customers is 53.  Finally, let's calculate the number of mobile app customers. We know that there were 42 customers who made purchases through the mobile app. Therefore, the number of mobile app customers is 42.  So, the total number of customers who purchased goods from all three channels is:   Total number of customers = 79 + 53 + 42 = 174 customers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 54 + 83 = 137 holes in total. Secondly, each hole can be filled with either 1 or 2 balls, so we have  137 x (1 + 2) = 274 balls in total. Finally, since there are 12 apples, we need to divide 274 by 12 to get the number of apples per hole. Therefore, the answer is:  274 / 12 = 22.83 apples per hole.
Response:  We know that there are 17 holes in total, and 9 of them are for soledad (solitude) and the remaining 8 holes are for other types of emotions.   Now, we need to find out which hole is for sadness.  To do this, we can use the process of elimination.  Since there are 8 holes left after deducting the 9 holes for solitude, we can start by assuming that each of the remaining 8 holes represents a different emotion.  Therefore, let's assign a number from 1 to 8 to each hole, respectively.  Once we have assigned numbers to all the holes, we can check if any of the numbers match the number of sadness.  If none of the numbers match, then we will have to re-examine our assumptions and try again.  So, let's begin!
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 water tanks with different capacities and 60 water tanks with standard capacity. We need to find out how many more liters of water can be stored in the non-standard capacity tanks compared to the standard capacity tanks. To do this, we will subtract the total capacity of the standard capacity tanks from the total capacity of all the tanks (non-standard + standard). Total Capacity of Standard Capacity Tanks = 60 x 500 = 30,000 Liters Total Capacity of All Tanks = 19 x Various Capacities + 60 x 500 =??? Since we don't know the exact capacities of the non-standard tanks, we cannot calculate the total capacity of all tanks directly. However, we can set up an equation based on the information given: Let C1, C2,..., C19 represent the capacities of the non-standard tanks, and let S represent the sum of their capacities. Total Capacity of All Tanks = S + 60 x 500 Therefore, our goal is to find the value of S. We know that S + 60 x 500 = Total Capacity of All Tanks Now, we have two equations: Equation 1: S + 60 x 500 =??? (given) Equation 2: S = 19 x Various Capacities + 60 x 500 Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1, we get: S + 60 x 500 = 19 x Various Capacities + 60 x 500 Combine like terms: S + 60 x 500 = 19 x Sum of Capacities + 60 x 500 Simplify: S + 60 x 500 = 19 x (Total Capacity of Non-Standard Tanks) + 60 x 500 Solve for S: S = 19 x Total Capacity of Non-Standard Tanks Now, we need to determine the value of Total Capacity of Non-Standard Tanks. Let's assume that the largest tank has
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 72 hours in 3 days. Secondly, each day has 24 hours, so there are 24 x 3 = 72 hours in total. Thirdly, since there are 32 hours of rain and 78 hours of sunshine, we can subtract 32 + 78 = 110 hours from the total number of hours, leaving us with 72 - 110 = -38 hours. Therefore, there are -38 hours of rain and 72 hours of sunshine.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 apples in the basket. Secondly, each apple has 80 calories and 54 grams of sugar. Therefore, to calculate the total number of calories and sugar content in the basket, we need to multiply the number of apples by their respective values. Calories: 36 x 80 = 2880 Sugar (grams): 36 x 54 = 1944 So, the total number of calories in the basket is 2880, and the total amount of sugar is 1944 grams.
Response:  We know that there are 30 holes in total, and 28 of them are water-filled holes (i.e., 28 holes have water level above the ground). The remaining two holes are dry wells (i.e., they do not have any water). Therefore, the number of dry wells is 2.   So, the answer is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 groups of people who have more than 79 bottles of water each. So, if we divide 79 by 4, we get:  79 / 4 = 19 2/3 bottles per group.  Therefore, there are 19 2/3 groups of people who have more than 79 bottles of water each.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 81 degrees of freedom for the first set of data (n = 81). Secondly, for the second set of data (n = 60), there are 60 - 35 = 25 degrees of freedom. Finally, for the third set of data (n = 60), there are 60 - 35 = 25 degrees of freedom as well. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom is:  81 + 25 + 25 = 131 degrees of freedom.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of water droplets in each type of liquid.  1. น้ำอัดลมปกติ (49) x 3 = 147 2. น้ำอัดลมไดเอท (40) x 3 = 120 3. น้ำอัดลมไลท์ (6) x 3 = 18 So, the total number of water droplets is: 147 + 120 + 18 = 385 Next, let's find out how many water droplets are there in all types of liquids combined. We add up all the numbers: 385 + 385 = 770 Therefore, there are 770 water droplets in all types of liquids combined.
Response:  First, we know that there were 317 people who visited the palace in one day.  Second, we know that there were 295 people who visited the palace the previous day.  So, to find out how many more people visited the palace on this day compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the total number of visitors on this day:  317 - 295 = 22.  Therefore, there were 22 more people who visited the palace on this day than on the previous day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 703 people who visited the temple in the previous day. Secondly, we are given that 246 of them visited again today. So, to find out how many people visited the temple for the first time today, we need to subtract the number of repeat visitors from the total number of visitors. Therefore, the number of first-time visitors today is:  703 - 246 = 457.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 100 people who attended the event in the previous day. Secondly, we are given that there were 666 people who attended the event in total. Finally, we want to find out how many more people attended the event in the current day compared to the previous day. To do this, we need to subtract the number of attendees in the previous day from the total number of attendees. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:  666 - 100 = 566 people. So, there were 566 more people who attended the event in the current day compared to the previous day.
Response:  First, we know that there were 132 people who visited the palace in one day. Next, we know that these visitors stayed for 327 days in total. Finally, we want to find out how many people visited the palace over the entire period of time. To do this, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of visitors per day. So, if we divide 327 by 132, we get an average of approximately 2.5 visitors per day. Therefore, the estimated number of visitors to the palace over the entire period of time is 2.5 x 406 = 1015 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 45 people who visited the palace in the previous day.  Secondly, we know that there are 829 people who have visited the palace within 85 days. So, to find out how many people visited the palace per day, we can divide the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85):  829 / 85 = 9.76  Therefore, approximately 10 people visited the palace per day.
Response:  First, we know that there were 71 photos taken during the visit to the palace. Next, we are told that after the meal, 557 people visited the palace. Finally, we are given that in the previous day, 188 people visited the palace. To find out how many people visited the palace in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, the total number of visitors to the palace is:  71 + 557 + 188 = 716 people.
Response:  First, we know that there were 661 people who visited the temple in one day.  Next, we are told that there were 600 people who visited the temple the previous day.  So, if we subtract 600 from 661, we get:  661 - 600 = 61  Therefore, the number of additional visitors to the temple on this particular day was 61 people.
Response:  First, we know that there were 92 people who visited the temple in the morning of the day before yesterday.  Next, we know that there were 419 people who visited the temple in the previous day (yesterday). Finally, we know that there were 103 people who visited the temple in the day before yesterday. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  92 + 419 + 103 = 614 people. Therefore, the total number of visitors to the temple over the three days was 614 people.
Response:  First, we know that there were 512 people who visited the palace in one day. Next, we know that there were 471 people who visited the palace the previous day. Finally, we know that there were 808 people who visited the palace two days before that. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:  512 + 471 + 808 = 1791 people. Therefore, the total number of visitors to the palace over the three days was 1791 people.
Response:  First, we know that there were 705 people who visited the palace in total. Next, we are told that there were 191 people who visited the palace the day before. Finally, we are given that there were 457 people who visited the palace on the previous day. To find out how many people visited the palace today, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous two days from the total number of visitors. Total visitors = 705 Subtracting the number of visitors from the previous two days gives us: 705 - 191 - 457 = 267 Therefore, there were 267 people who visited the palace today.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total distance of the journey is 628 kilometers.  Now, if we divide this distance by the number of people traveling together (159), we get an average distance per person of:  628 km / 159 people = 40.37 km/person.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of dye needed is 49 grams. Secondly, we know that the first dyeing process requires 288 grams of dye. Therefore, the number of times the fabric needs to be dyed in the first process is:  49 grams / 288 grams = 0.17 (or 17%)  Now, let's calculate the remaining amount of dye required for the second dyeing process. We know that the second dyeing process requires 260 grams of dye. So, the number of times the fabric needs to be dyed in the second process is:  49 grams - (260 grams x 0.17) = 49 grams - (45.2 grams) = 3.8 grams  Therefore, the fabric needs to be dyed 3 times in the second process to use up all the remaining dye.  In conclusion, the fabric needs to be dyed a total of 17 + 3 = 20 times to achieve the desired color.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of grams of dye used is 57 grams. Secondly, we know that the amount of dye used for each color is 22 grams. Therefore, to find out how many colors are used in total, we can divide the total number of grams of dye used by the amount of dye used per color: 57 grams / 22 grams =?  So, there will be 57/22 = 2 colors used in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the person has 166 cm of height and currently wears size 20 shoes. To calculate how many more centimeters they need to add to their height in order to fit into size 24 shoes, we can subtract the length of the current shoes from the desired shoe size (size 24) and then divide by 5 (since there are 5 cm in each shoe size). So, we have:  24 - 20 = 4 cm (difference between desired and current shoe sizes) 4 cm / 5 = 0.8 cm (additional height needed for size 24 shoes) Therefore, the person needs to add approximately 0.8 cm to their height in order to fit into size 24 shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of grams is 557 grams and there are 17 grams in each scoop. So, to find out how many scoops are needed, we can divide the total number of grams by the weight of one scoop:  557 g / 17 g =?  Now, we need to round up our answer to the nearest whole number since we cannot have a fraction of a scoop. Therefore, the answer is: 557 g / 17 g = 32 scoops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of rainwater collected is 492 cubic meters (cm). Next, we need to find out how much water each tank can hold. We are given that there are 11 tanks and each tank has a capacity of 45 cm. So, we can calculate the total capacity of all 11 tanks as follows: Total capacity = 11 x 45 cm = 495 cm Now, we can divide the total amount of rainwater collected (492 cm) by the total capacity of all 11 tanks (495 cm) to find out how many tanks are needed: Number of tanks = 492 cm / 495 cm = 10 tanks Therefore, the farmer needs 10 tanks to store all the rainwater collected during the rainy season.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 94 people in total and each person has 90 bottles of water. So, the total number of bottles is 94 x 90 = 8560 bottles. Now, we need to find out how many bottles will be left after 6 days. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottles used per day from the total number of bottles. Since each person uses 30 bottles per day, we can calculate the number of bottles used per day as follows:  8560 - (94 x 30) = 8560 - 2830 = 5730 bottles. Therefore, there will be 5730 bottles left after 6 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 266 people who have been trapped in the cave for 5 days. We also know that each person has 90 liters of water per day. So, to calculate how many bottles of water they need, we can use the following formula: Total amount of water needed = Number of people x Amount of water per person per day. In this case, the total amount of water needed is: Total amount of water needed = 266 people x 90 liters/day = 24,840 liters or 24,840 bottles (since one bottle contains 10 liters). Now, let's convert this number into days. Since each bottle contains 10 liters and there are 30 bottles per box, we can calculate the number of boxes needed as follows: Number of boxes needed = Total amount of water needed / Number of liters per box. In this case, the number of boxes needed is: Number of boxes needed = 24,840 liters / 30 liters/box = 830 boxes. Therefore, to supply enough water for all 266 people for 5 days, we would need 830 boxes of bottled water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 294 people in total who have been waiting for the elevator for more than 24 hours. This means that each person has waited for an average of 244/294 = approximately 0.83 days (or 19 hours and 45 minutes). Now, we need to find out how many floors the building has. The question states that the elevator stops at every floor, so we can assume that the building has at least as many floors as the number of people waiting for the elevator. Therefore, the building has 294 floors. However, this is not the final answer yet, as we still need to determine how long it takes for the elevator to stop at each floor. According to the question, the elevator stops at every floor, so it will take the same amount of time to stop at each floor. Therefore, the total time it takes for the elevator to stop at all 294 floors is 294 x 19 hours and 45 minutes = approximately 57,830 hours or approximately 2,425 days (or 6.7 years). So, the answer is 2,425 days.
Response:  First, we know that there are 235 people in total who have been infected with COVID-19. Of those, 100 people were infected with the virus for 77 days (on average). To find out how many people were infected per day, we can divide the number of infected people by the number of days they were infected: 100 / 77 = 1.304814814814815 (rounded to two decimal places) So, approximately 1.3 people were infected per day.   However, this calculation only takes into account the people who were infected for an entire period of time (i.e., 77 days). What about the others who were infected for less than 77 days? We need to calculate their contribution as well. Let's assume that these individuals were infected for x days, where x is a variable. We can add their contributions to our previous calculation: 1.3 + x * (number of people infected per day) Since we don't know the exact value of x, let's consider all possible values between 1 and 76 (since the minimum duration was 1 day and the maximum duration was 77 days): x = 1, 2,..., 76 Now, we need to calculate the number of people infected per day for each value of x: 1.3 + x * (number of people infected per day) = 1.3 + x * (100 / 77) For example, if x = 1, then: 1.3 + x * (100 / 77) = 1.3 + 1 * (100 / 77) = 1.3 + 130.4814814814815 = 141.7814814814815 If x = 76, then: 1.3 + x * (100 / 77) = 1.3 + 76 * (100 / 77) = 1.3 + 7600 = 7601.3 Now, we sum up all these calculations
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 252 people who have been caught in the trap and they will be executed one by one every day. So, if we assume that all 252 people will be executed, then the number of days it would take to execute them all is:  252 / 108 = 2.34 days (approximately)  However, as mentioned in the problem statement, the executions will stop after 57 days. Therefore, the actual number of days it would take to execute all 252 people is less than or equal to 57 days.  So, our final answer is:  57 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 people who will be taking the exam and each person needs to fill out 8 forms per day. So, in total, how many forms need to be filled out per day?  8 x 36 = 288 forms per day. Now, let's calculate how many days it would take to complete all the forms if they can only fill out 240 forms per day. 240 / 288 = 0.81 days or approximately 1 day and 5 hours. Therefore, it would take approximately 1 day and 5 hours to complete all the forms if they can only fill out 240 forms per day.
Response:  We know that there are 26 fish in each group and 52 groups in total. To find out how many fish there are altogether, we need to multiply 26 by 52.  26 x 52 = 1344 So, there are 1344 fish in all.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 fish in total. Secondly, each person can catch 2 fish at most. Therefore, if we divide 40 by 2, we get:  40 / 2 = 20 So, the remaining number of fish after both people have caught their limit is 20.
Response:  We know that there are 56 animals in total for the freshwater aquarium and 10 animals for the brackish water aquarium, so we can start by adding these two numbers together to get our grand total of animals:  56 + 10 = 66 animals.  Now, we need to subtract out the number of animals that appear in both lists (freshwater and brackish) because we don't want to double-count them.  To do this, let's look at the list of animals for each type of aquarium and see which ones overlap:   • Freshwater Aquarium: catfish, crab, lobster, shrimp, snail, squid, turtle   • Brackish Water Aquarium: catfish, shrimp, squid  There are three animals that appear in both lists: catfish, shrimp, and squid. So, if we subtract out these three animals from the grand total, we get:  66 - 3 = 63 animals.  Therefore, there are 63 different species of fish and other aquatic animals in the two aquariums combined.
Response:  We know that there are 74 fish in total and 22 fish for each type of fish. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Total number of fish = 74 (total) Number of fish per type = 22 (per type) Total number of types of fish =? (to be found out) To find out the total number of types of fish, we can divide the total number of fish by the number of fish per type: Total number of types of fish = Total number of fish / Number of fish per type Total number of types of fish = 74 / 22 Total number of types of fish = 3 (rounded to the nearest whole number) So, there are 3 types of fish in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 species of freshwater fish and 62 species of marine fish in total. Secondly, each species has multiple individuals, with an average of 19 individuals per species. Therefore, to calculate the total number of fish, we need to multiply the number of species by the number of individuals per species.  Total number of fish = (15 x 19) + (62 x 19) = 15 x 19 = 285 + 62 x 19 = 1178 = 1463  So, there are approximately 1463 fish in the aquarium.
Response:  If 13 shirts cost $39, then each shirt costs $39/13 = $3 per shirt.   Therefore, if 39 shirts are purchased, the total cost would be 3 x 39 = $117.
Response:  If each pack of detergent has 3 pieces of underwear, and she buys 66 packs, then how many pieces of underwear will she have in total?  66 x 3 = 198 pieces of underwear.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 packs of diapers in total. Secondly, each pack contains 56 diapers, so there are 28 x 56 = 1568 diapers in total. Finally, we need to find out how many white diapers are available in each pack. Since the question states ""there are 56 diapers in each pack, and among them, there are 30 white diapers"", we can calculate as follows: 30/56 = 0.54 ( fraction) or 54% (percentage). Therefore, there are 54% of white diapers in each pack, which is equal to 54/1568 = 336 white diapers in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 53 packs of white socks in total. Secondly, each pack contains 34 pairs of socks, so there are 53 x 34 = 1824 pairs of socks in total. Finally, since the mother wants to buy 57 pairs of socks, she will need to purchase an additional  57 - 1824 = 546 pairs of socks. Therefore, the answer is 546 pairs of socks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 51 pieces of white cloth in total. Secondly, each pack contains 3 pieces of cloth. Therefore, to find out how many packs can be bought with 51 pieces of cloth, we need to divide 51 by 3.  51 ÷ 3 =?  The result is... 17! So, 17 packs of white cloth can be bought with 51 pieces of cloth.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 70 pieces of white socks in total. Secondly, if each pack contains 14 pairs of socks, then there will be 70/14 = 5 packets of socks. Finally, since each packet has 14 pairs of socks, there will be 5 x 14 = 70 pairs of socks in total. Therefore, the answer is 70 pairs of white socks.
Response:  We have 4 tubes with 36 bulbs in total. Each tube has the same number of bulbs, so we can divide the total number of bulbs among the tubes equally.  36 / 4 = 9 So each tube will have 9 bulbs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 33 pieces of chocolate in total. Secondly, each piece has 11 chocolates inside.

Response:  Firstly, we know that each shelf has 41 books and there are 53 shelves in total. So, to find out how many books there are in total, we need to multiply the number of books per shelf by the number of shelves. Therefore, the total number of books is:  41 x 53 = 2193 books.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 sheets in total and each sheet has 7 pieces of paper with the same number of cucumbers. So, to find out how many cucumbers there are in total, we need to multiply the number of sheets by the number of pieces of paper per sheet.  Therefore, the answer is:  14 x 7 = 98 cucumbers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 types of cucumbers and each type has 7 chili peppers. So, in total, there are 3 x 7 = 21 chili peppers. Therefore, I have 21 chili peppers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 26 boxes of candy in total. Secondly, each box contains 52 candies, so there are 26 x 52 = 1352 candies in total. Finally, if there are 15 children and each child gets an equal number of candies, then each child will get 1352 / 15 = 90 candies. So, there are 90 candies in each box.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 14 tubes in total and each tube has 28 bulbs. Therefore, the total number of bulbs is 14 x 28 = 432 bulbs. Next, we know that there are 86 lamps in total and each lamp has 5 bulbs. So, the total number of bulbs used for lamps is 86 x 5 = 430 bulbs. Now, we can see that the total number of bulbs used for both tubes and lamps is 432 + 430 = 862 bulbs. Finally, we divide the total number of bulbs by the number of tubes to find out how many bulbs are used per tube: 862 / 14 = 61 bulbs per tube.
Response:  If there are 25 copies of each block, and each block has 5 holes, then there will be 25 x 5 = 125 holes in total for all blocks.   Therefore, if we want to fill all the holes with balls, we need at least 125 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 blocks in total and each block has 9 chambers. So, to calculate how many chambers are needed for each block, we can divide 20 by 9:  20 / 9 = 2  Therefore, each block needs 2 chambers. Now, let's calculate how many chambers are needed in total for all 20 blocks:  2 x 20 = 40 chambers  So, there will be 40 chambers needed in total for all 20 blocks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many square meters of space are needed for each block based on the given information. We know that there are 6 blocks and each block has an area of 30 square meters. So, the total area required for all six blocks is:  6 x 30 = 180 square meters. Now, let's move on to calculating the number of tiles needed for each block. Since each tile covers an area of 24 square centimeters, we can divide the total area required for each block by the area per tile to get the number of tiles needed: 180 / 24 = 7.5 tiles per block. Therefore, we need 7.5 x 6 = 45 tiles in total to cover all six blocks.
Response:  If there are 14 houses in each block and each house needs to receive 2 copies of the notice, then we need to distribute 28 notices (14 x 2) for each block.  Therefore, if there are B blocks in total, we will need to distribute 28B notices in total.
Response:  Firstly, we have 20 blocks in total.  Secondly, each block has 4 floors.  Therefore, we need to calculate how many elevator stops are required for each block.   To do this, we divide the number of floors (4) by the number of floors per building (8). This gives us:  4/8 = 0.5 or 5 elevator stops per building. Since there are 20 buildings, we multiply 5 by 20 to get:  5 x 20 = 100 elevator stops in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 78 blocks in total and each block has 19 floors. So, to calculate how many elevator trips are needed for each building, we need to divide the number of blocks by the number of floors per block. In this case, it would be:  78 blocks / 19 floors/block = 4 trips/building  Therefore, there will be 4 elevator trips needed for each building.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 blocks in total and each block has 4 houses. Therefore, the number of houses in all blocks is 8 x 4 = 32 houses. Now, if we send 32 houses to each block, we need to divide 32 by 4 to find out how many blocks we can build. So, 32 / 4 = 8 blocks. Hence, there will be 8 blocks in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 houses in each block.  Secondly, we know that each house has 4 rooms. Therefore, to calculate how many notices should be given to each block, we need to multiply the number of houses in each block by the number of rooms in each house.  12 (houses) x 4 (rooms/house) = 48 notices per block.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pieces of paper are needed for each block based on the number of houses in each block. We have 17 houses in each block, so we need 17 pieces of paper for each block. Since there are 4 blocks in total, we need 4 x 17 = 68 pieces of paper in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each rabbit can lay 10 eggs per month and each chicken lays 20 eggs per month. So, in total, they will lay 300 eggs (10 x 30). Now, let's calculate how many groups of 4 eggs each we can make with 300 eggs. We can make:  300 / 4 = 75 groups of 4 eggs each. Therefore, there will be 75 groups of 4 eggs each if we distribute the 300 eggs equally among the 4 children.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs are in each carton. There are 12 eggs in a standard carton. So, if there are 5 cartons, there will be 5 x 12 = 60 eggs in total. Next, we need to calculate how many eggs are needed for each of the three recipes. For Recipe 1, we need 10 eggs. For Recipe 2, we need 15 eggs. And for Recipe 3, we need 20 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs required is 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 eggs. Since we have already calculated that there are 60 eggs in total, we can see that we have enough eggs to make all three recipes.
Response:  First, we know that each group has 2 eggs.  So if there are 11 groups, then there will be 11 x 2 = 22 eggs in total.   Therefore, Rebecca needs to find 22 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each kilogram of eggs has 8 eggs and 6 chicks. So, if we have 4 kilograms of eggs, we will have 4 x 8 = 32 eggs in total. However, we also know that each kilogram of eggs produces 6 chicks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of chicks as follows: 32 eggs x 6 chicks per egg = 192 chicks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each kilogram of eggs contains 10-12 eggs. So, if Rebecca has 3 kilograms of eggs, she has 3 x 10 = 30 eggs in total.   Secondly, we know that each egg is divided into 4 parts. Therefore, if Rebecca has 30 eggs, she has 30 x 4 = 120 parts of eggs in total. Finally, we know that each part of an egg weighs 15 grams. Thus, the total weight of all the eggs is 120 x 15 = 1800 grams or 1.8 kilograms.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs are in each carton.  There are 6 eggs in each carton. Next, we need to calculate how many cartons of eggs there will be if we have 18 dozens of eggs. A dozen is equal to 12 eggs, so we can multiply 18 by 12 to get 216 eggs. Finally, we need to divide the total number of eggs (216) by the number of eggs per carton (6) to find out how many cartons there will be. Therefore, there will be 36 cartons of eggs.  
Question: What is the next number in the pattern: 3, 5, 9, 17,? 
Answer: The given sequence consists of consecutive odd numbers, and the next number would be one more than 17, which is 19."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many eggs are in each group.   Group 1 has 99 eggs and Group 2 has 9 eggs.  Group 3 has 27 eggs.  Next, we add up all the eggs from each group to get the total number of eggs.  So, (99 + 9 + 27) = 145 eggs.  Therefore, there will be 145 eggs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and she wants to divide them equally among her 6 children. So, if we divide 20 by 6, we get:  20 / 6 = 3  Therefore, each child will receive 3 eggs.  However, Rebecca also has 6 ducklings that need to be fed. If we add the number of ducklings to the number of children, we get:  3 (children) + 6 (ducklings) = 9  So, in total, Rebecca needs to feed 9 animals with her 20 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that there are 20 eggs in total.   Second, we know that each carton contains 6 eggs. Therefore, the number of cartons is: 20 / 6 = 3. Thirdly, since each carton has 6 eggs and there are 3 cartons, the total number of eggs is: 3 x 6 = 18. Finally, if there are 12 extra eggs, then the total number of eggs is: 18 + 12 = 30. So, there will be 30 eggs in all.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the person has played for 154 rounds and has won 11 prizes in each round. So, if we calculate the total number of rounds they have played, it would be:  154 x 11 = 1694 rounds.

"Response:  If the player has won $84 in two rounds of playing the game, and they have won the same amount of money in each round, then we can start by finding out how much they won in one round.  
We know that the player won $84 in total, so if they won the same amount of money in each round, then they must have won $84/2 = $42 in each round.  Now, let's find out how many times they played the game to win this amount.  We can do this by dividing the amount they won by the cost of playing the game per round.  Since the cost of playing the game is not given, we will assume it to be $1 for simplicity.  So, we can divide $42 by $1 to get the number of rounds they played: 
$42 ÷ $1 = 42 rounds  Therefore, the player played the game 42 rounds to win $84."

Response:  There are 4 surnames in total (Emily has 4 surnames). Each surname uses 5 stamps (total of 20 stamps). Therefore, Emily needs 20 stamps in total. So the answer is 20.
Response:  If Emily has 72 friends and each friend is given 3 gifts, then she needs to buy  72 x 3 = 216 gifts in total.  However, since some of her friends have multiple children, we need to adjust the number of gifts accordingly.  If she has 6 children herself and each child receives 3 gifts, that's an additional  6 x 3 = 18 gifts.  So, in total, Emily needs to buy  216 + 18 = 234 gifts.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 43 people in total and each person can make 20 snowflakes. So, the total number of snowflakes is 43 x 20 = 860 snowflakes. Now, we need to determine how many sticks of cotton candy are needed for each snowflake. Since Emily has 5 children and each child can make 4 snowflakes, she needs 5 x 4 = 20 sticks of cotton candy in total. Therefore, the number of sticks of cotton candy required per snowflake is 20 / 860 = 1/40 or approximately 0.025 sticks per snowflake.
Response:  There are 44 people in total, and each person has 26 strings. So, the total number of strings is 44 x 26 = 1136 strings. Now, we need to find out how many beads Emily needs in total. Each string has 2 beads, so she needs 1136 x 2 = 2272 beads in total. Therefore, Emily needs 2272 beads to make all the friendship bracelets for her friends.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 people from Lampang province who went to Bangkok for the New Year celebration, and 668278 people stayed at home. To find out how many more people traveled to Bangkok than stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of people who stayed at home from the total number of people who went to Bangkok. So, the difference is:  819058 - 668278 = 150,330 people more traveled to Bangkok than stayed at home.
Response:  First, we know that there are 202,958 students from Lorraine who went to school and 777,622 people living in their homes. Next, we need to find out how many of these people are children. To do this, we can use the fact that half of the population is under 18 years old. So, if there are 777,622 people living in their homes, then:  Half of them are under 18 = 388,811 (rounded) Children at home Therefore, there are 388,811 children living at home, not including those who have gone to school. Now let's add the number of students who have gone to school: 202,958 + 388,811 = 591,769 This means that there are approximately 591,769 children in total, including both those who have gone to school and those who are living at home.
Response:  First, we know that there are 898,051 people in the province of Lorraine during the school year. Of these, 629,424 students attend school, leaving 268,627 people who do not attend school. To find out how many children live at home, we need to subtract the number of students from the total population. So, the number of children living at home is:  268,627 - 629,424 = 360,801. Therefore, there are approximately 360,801 children living at home in Lorraine.
Response:  First, we know that there are 313,473 people in the district during the rainy season. Of these, 274,865 live at home and go to school. Therefore, the number of children who go to school is equal to 274,865 - 313,473 = 38,508.   So, there are 38,508 children going to school during the rainy season in the district.
Response:  First, we know that there are 907,611 people living in Lorraine County and 455,682 people living in other counties. So, if we subtract the number of people living in other counties from the total number of people living in Lorraine County, we can find out how many people live in Lorraine County.  907,611 - 455,682 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 451,929 people living in Lorraine County.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 800059 people from Lorraine who have gone to work in other provinces. Secondly, we know that there are 828521 people living in Lorraine. Therefore, if we subtract the number of people who have gone to work in other provinces (800059) from the total population of Lorraine (828521), we can find out how many people are left living in Lorraine.  So, the answer is:  828521 - 800059 = 288462 people.
Response:  First, we know that there are 61,619 children living in Lorrense County who did not evacuate their homes.  Next, we know that there were 91,676 children in total in Lorrense County, including those who evacuated and those who did not. Finally, we want to find out how many children from Lorrense County went to the shelter. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children who did not evacuate (61,619) from the total number of children in the county (91,676). So, the answer is:  91,676 - 61,619 = 30,057  Therefore, approximately 30,057 children from Lorrense County went to the shelter.
Response:  First, we know that there are 34,044 children from Lorraine who entered the camp, and 134,867 children from other provinces who also entered the camp. Therefore, the total number of children who entered the camp is:  34,044 + 134,867 = 168,911  Next, we need to find out how many children are staying in their homes outside the camp. We know that there are 424,944 children from other provinces who did not enter the camp. So, the number of children staying in their homes outside the camp is:  424,944 - 168,911 = 256,033  Therefore, the total number of children in the camp plus those staying in their homes outside the camp is:  168,911 + 256,033 = 424,944
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 610,769 children from Lorraine who have entered the camp, and 590,796 children living in other provinces but have joined the camp as well. Therefore, the total number of children in the camp is:  610,769 + 590,796 = 1,201,565 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 644,997 children in Lorrense County who stay at home. Secondly, there are 893,835 children who go to school outside of the county. Lastly, there are 78 children from other provinces who join the school in Lorrense County. To find out the total number of children in Lorrense County, we need to add up all these numbers. Therefore, the total number of children in Lorrense County is:  644,997 + 893,835 + 78 = 1,576,700.
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 apples and 9 children. So, if we divide the number of apples among the children equally, each child will get...
"Response:  If Adam has 10 apples and gives 2 to Jack, then Adam will have 8 apples left.  So, Adam has more apples than Jack.  

Question:  How many apples does each person have now?  Answer:  Adam has 8 apples and Jack has 2 apples."
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jack has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jack has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jack has. So, let's do that:  9 (Adam) - 10 (Jack) =?  Yes, that's right! Jack has 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 10 kids and each kid eats 8 apples. So, in total, Jack's kids eat 10 x 8 = 80 apples. Now, let's compare this number with Adam's kids. Adam has 8 kids and each kid eats 3 apples, so they eat a total of 8 x 3 = 24 apples. Therefore, Jack's kids eat more apples than Adam's kids. The difference is 80 - 24 = 56 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jack have 6 apples in total.  If we divide 6 by 2 (Adam and Jack), we get 3. So each of them has 3 apples. Now, let's look at the remaining 4 apples. If we divide 4 by 2 again, we get 2. Therefore, there are 2 apples left for the other two children.  
Question: How many apples do you think each child will get if they share these 2 apples equally among themselves?  Answer:  To find out how many apples each child will get, we need to divide 2 by 4 (the number of children). This gives us 0.5, which means each child will get half an apple."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Am has 7 children and each child has an apple. So, in total, Am has 7 apples.   Secondly, Jack has 3 apples and Jill has 4 apples. Therefore, together they have 3 + 4 = 7 apples.  Finally, we can see that all of the children combined have a total of 7 + 7 = 14 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adam has 12 kids and Jack has 9 kids. So, if we add up all the children of both families, we get:  12 + 9 = 21 children in total. Now, let's compare the number of grandchildren of each family. For Adam's family, there are 8 grandchildren, while for Jack's family, there are 3 grandchildren. Therefore, the difference between the number of grandchildren of Adam and Jack is:  8 - 3 = 5 grandchildren. Finally, we need to find out how many great-grandchildren they have in common. Since Adam has 8 grandchildren and Jack has 3 grandchildren, they have a total of:  8 + 3 = 11 great-grandchildren in common.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adam has 4 children and each child has an apple pie. So, Adam has 4 x 1 = 4 apple pies in total. Next, we know that Jack has 10 children and each child has an apple pie too. Therefore, Jack has 10 x 1 = 10 apple pies in total. Now, let's add up all the apple pies from both families. We have 4 + 10 = 14 apple pies in total. Finally, we are asked how many apple pies do Adam and Jack have in total? To find out, we need to divide the total number of apple pies by the number of children they have. In this case, we have 14 / 4 = 3 apple pies per child for Adam and 14 / 10 = 1 apple pie per child for Jack. So, Adam has 3 apple pies and Jack has 1 apple pie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 5 children and each child has $89. So, the total amount of money Jack has is:  5 x $89 = $445. Now, let's consider the apples. Each apple costs $11, so the total cost of all the apples is:  11 x 11 = $121. Therefore, the total amount of money Jack needs to buy apples is: $121. So, the number of apples Jack can buy with his money is: $445 - $121 = $324. Thus, Jack can buy 324 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has been practicing her piano for 31 minutes in the morning, 270 minutes in the afternoon, and 419 minutes in total per day. Therefore, the total number of minutes she practices every day is:  31 + 270 + 419 = 720 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen and her friends prepared 90 portions of food for the party last night. Secondly, they had 51 portions left over after the party. Finally, they sold 484 portions of food today. So, if we subtract the number of portions left over (51) from the total number of portions sold (484), we get:  484 - 51 = 433 portions of food were sold today.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has 527 pieces of chocolate and 86 pieces of melon. So, if she gives each of her friends an equal amount of chocolate and melon, how many pieces will each friend get?   To find out, let's divide the total number of chocolate pieces (527) by the number of friends (let's say there are 5 friends): 527 / 5 = 105.4 (round up to the nearest whole number, which is 106). Therefore, each friend will receive 106 pieces of chocolate.   Now, let's calculate how many pieces of melon each friend will receive. We can do this by dividing the total number of melon pieces (86) by the same number of friends as before: 86 / 5 = 17.2 (round up to the nearest whole number, which is 18). Therefore, each friend will receive 18 pieces of melon.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of cups of coffee that Helen and her friends will drink in total. To do this, we need to multiply the number of cups of coffee they will drink each day by the number of days they will be at the camp. So, for Helen, we have: 

144 cups x 2 days = 288 cups 

For her friends, we have: 

397 cups x 2 days = 794 cups 

Therefore, the total number of cups of coffee consumed by Helen and her friends is: 

288 + 794 = 1082 cups 

Now, let's calculate how much money they will spend on coffee based on the price per cup. For example, if the price per cup is THB 50, then: 

1082 cups x THB 50 = THB 54,100 

So, Helen and her friends will spend approximately THB 54,100 on coffee during their two-day camping trip."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has 19 chicken pieces and 231 duck pieces in total. Next, we need to calculate how many chicken pieces she needs to buy to make up for the missing amount of duck pieces. To do this, we can subtract the number of duck pieces from the total number of pieces:  237 - 231 = 6. So, Helen needs to buy 6 more chicken pieces. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of cups of coffee that Helen and her friends will drink based on their preferences.  For Helen, she prefers 3 cups of strong black coffee (197 ml x 3 = 591 ml).  Her friend, Hiap, likes 4 cups of weak coffee with milk (200 ml x 4 = 800 ml). Another friend, Meow, wants 5 cups of hot chocolate (150 ml x 5 = 750 ml). Finally, there are 66 cups of cold coffee left over from last night (66 x 200 ml = 13,200 ml). In total, they will consume 591 + 800 + 750 + 13,200 = 16,341 ml of coffee and hot chocolate.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of cups needed for each type of coffee.   For the first order (519 cups), we have:  519 cups x 3 types of coffee = 1557 cups  For the second order (359 cups), we have:  359 cups x 3 types of coffee = 1077 cups  Therefore, the total number of cups needed is:  1557 + 1077 = 2634 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kaitlyn has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, to find out how many more games Kaitlyn has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has.  81 - 59 =?  Yes, that's right! Kaitlyn has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the new friend has 88 games and old friends have 53 games. So, if we add both of them together, we get:  88 + 53 = 141 games in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of games played by both teams is 78 + 86 = 164 games. Next, we are told that the new team has 48 games. Therefore, the number of games left to be played by the old team is 164 - 48 = 116 games. So, the old team has 116 games left to play.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the new games have 84 games and old games have 19 games, so the total number of games is:  84 + 19 = 103 games. Next, we are told that her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so the total number of games they have is:  8 + 69 = 77 games. Therefore, the sum of all the games is:  103 + 77 = 180 games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of games played by the team is 62 + 80 = 142 games. Next, we are told that the team has won 73 games and lost 41 games. Therefore, the number of games they have left to play is 142 - (73 + 41) = 142 - 114 = 28 games. So, the team has 28 games left to play.
Response:  If my friend has games 57 and 63, that means they have 120 games in total (57 + 63).   Therefore, my friend has more than 120 games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of new games is 57. Secondly, the number of old games is 39. Thirdly, the number of games in total is 57 + 39 = 96. Finally, the number of additional games is 96 - 34 = 62. Therefore, there are 62 additional games more than the number of games played by her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $60 and Jessica has $19.  Secondly, we know that Jessica spent $33 during the week.  So, how much did Fred spend if he gave Jessica $33?   To find out, we can subtract the amount Jessica spent from her initial amount:   $19 - $33 =?  Can you solve for this equation?
Response:  Firstly, we know that A has 86 dollars and B has 5 dollars.  Secondly, we know that they spent money together during the day and had 9 dollars left over at night.  So, let's calculate how much they spent in total.  To do this, we need to add up the amount of money that each person spent.  For A, we know that they spent $86 - $9 = $77.  For B, we know that they spent $5 - $9 = $4.  Therefore, the total amount spent by both individuals is $77 + $4 = $81.  Now, we can find out how much money A has left after spending their share of the expenses.  We know that A spent $77, so they have $86 - $77 = $9 left.  Similarly, we can find out how much money B has left after spending their share of the expenses.  We know that B spent $4, so they have $5 - $4 = $1 left.  Finally, we can add up the amounts that each person has left to find out the final answer.  In this case, A has $9 left, and B has $1 left.  Therefore, the total amount of money that A and B have left is $9 + $1 = $10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emily has $19 dollars and Jessica has $16 dollars.  Secondly, we know that they spent $40 dollars in total during the week.  So, let's calculate how much each of them spent.  We can do this by dividing the total amount they spent ($40) by the number of people who spent money (2).  This gives us:  Each person spent $\$20 = \$40/2$.  Now, let's check if Emily and Jessica have enough money to cover their spending.  For Emily, she had $19 dollars and spent $\$20$, so she is short $\$1$.  For Jessica, she had $16 dollars and spent $\$20$, so she is also short $\$4$.  Therefore, neither of them has enough money to cover their spending.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 in his wallet at the beginning of the week and spent $22 during the week. So, he has $92 left ($114 - $22). Next, we know that Jessica had $22 at the end of the week and spent $78 during the week. So, she has $14 left ($22 - $78). Therefore, the total amount of money that Fred and Jessica have between them is $92 + $14 = $106.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money that A received from the sale of the house was 111 dolla...
Response:  Firstly, we know that A has lent B 49 dol-lars and C has lent D 3 dol-lars.  Secondly, we know that E has paid to A, B, and C a total of 112 dol-lars. Finally, we know that D has paid back to C 63 dol-lars. So, let's calculate how much money each person has received from E. We can start with A, since A has lent B 49 dol-lars and E has paid A 112 dol-lars, so A has received 112 - 49 = 63 dol-lars from E. Next, we can look at B, who has lent A 49 dol-lars and E has paid A 112 dol-lars, so B has received 112 - 49 = 63 dol-lars from E. Now, let's check C, who has lent D 3 dol-lars and E has paid D 63 dol-lars, so C has received 63 - 3 = 60 dol-lars from E. Lastly, we can calculate for D, who has borrowed 3 dol-lars from C and paid back 63 dol-lars to C, so D has paid back 63 - 3 = 60 dol-lars to C. Therefore, the amount of money each person has received from E is as follows: A: 63 dol-lars B: 63 dol-lars C: 60 dol-lars D: 60 dol-lars
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money that Auntie received from selling her goods was 78 dolla...
Response:  Firstly, we know that Auntie received 33 baht from her son and 95 baht from her daughter-in-law in total, which is equal to 128 baht (33 + 95). Secondly, she spent 16 baht on newspapers and 74 baht on transportation, so she has remaining money of 128 - 16 - 74 = 38 baht. Therefore, Auntie has 38 baht left after spending all the money she received during the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Auntie has 47 dollars and spends 99 dollars in one week. So, she spends $52 ($99 - $47) more than what she has.  Secondly, we know that she receives $111 dollars from her grandchildren and gives $34 dollars to her neighbor. Therefore, she receives $77 dollars more than what she spends ($111 - $34).  Finally, we can calculate how much money Auntie has after receiving the money from her grandchildren by adding the amount she spends and the amount she receives:  Total Amount = Spending Amount + Receiving Amount = $52 + $77 = $129  So, Auntie has $129 dollars after receiving the money from her grandchildren.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 20 kilograms after exercising every day for a month. So, her current weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the weight loss of the person is 101 kg. To find out how much weight they lost per day, we need to divide the total weight loss by the number of days they have been exercising. So, if they started exercising 27 days ago and lost 101 kg, then they lost approximately:  101 kg / 27 days = 3.74 kg/day (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the person lost approximately 3.74 kg or 8 lbs per day during their exercise program.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after 126 days of dieting, she had lost 66 kilograms. Therefore, her daily weight loss is:  66 kg / 126 days = approximately 0.52 kg per day.  So, if she continues to diet for another 30 days (as mentioned in the question), her estimated total weight loss would be:  0.52 kg/day x 30 days = approximately 15.6 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that after 35 days of dieting, she had lost 10 kg or 22 lbs. Secondly, before starting her diet, her weight was 69 kg or 152 lbs. Therefore, to find out how much weight she has lost in total, we need to subtract her original weight from her current weight after dieting for 35 days. So, the calculation is as follows:  69 kg - 22 lbs =?  To convert pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg), we can use the following conversion factor: 1 lb = 0.45 kg. Now, let's substitute the value of 22 lbs into the formula: 22 lbs x 0.45 kg/lb =?  Simplifying and solving for the unknown quantity, we get:? = 9.9 kg  Therefore, after dieting for 35 days, she has lost a total of 9.9 kg or approximately 21.8 lbs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie lost 50 kilograms in the first week and then lost another 60 kilograms in the second week. Therefore, the total weight loss of Jessie is:  50 kg + 60 kg = 110 kg.  However, the question asked for the current weight of Jessie after losing 114 kilograms. So, we need to add 4 kilograms to the total weight loss:  110 kg + 4 kg = 114 kg.  Therefore, the current weight of Jessie is 114 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. Therefore, her total weight loss for two weeks is:  62 kg + 140 kg = 202 kg.  Now, let's calculate how much she weighed before starting her diet. We can do this by subtracting her weight loss from her current weight:  202 kg - 9 kg (her current weight) = 193 kg.  So, Jessica weighed approximately 193 kilograms before starting her diet.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 56 kilograms in the first week and then lost an additional 99 kilograms in the second week. So, in total, she lost 155 kilograms (56 + 99). Now, let's calculate her current weight. We know that she started at 92 kilograms, so if we subtract 155 from 92, we get:  92 - 155 = -63 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 63 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 95 tigers and 61 leopards in total. Secondly, we know that there are 64 tigers who have not been vaccinated. Therefore, to find out how many leopards have not been vaccinated, we can subtract the number of vaccinated tigers from the total number of tigers. In other words, we can subtract 64 from 95. So, the number of leopards who have not been vaccinated is:  95 - 64 = 31.  Thus, there are 31 leopards who have not been vaccinated.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 93 tigers and 97 leopards in the zoo. Secondly, we know that 40 of the leopards are not spayed or neutered. Therefore, to find out how many leopards are not spayed or neutered, we can subtract 40 from 97. So, the number of leopards not spayed or neutered is:  97 - 40 = 57.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 tigers and 75 deer in the zoo. Next, we know that there are 82 monkeys and 19 birds in the zoo. Now, let's calculate how many animals are not accounted for. To do this, we subtract the number of animals we know about from the total number of animals in the zoo. Total number of animals = 3 (tigers) + 75 (deer) + 82 (monkeys) + 19 (birds) = 179 animals Not accounted for = Total number of animals - (3 + 75 + 82 + 19) = 179 - 164 = 15 animals So, there are 15 animals that are not accounted for in the zoo.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 79 animals in total, and 24 of them are monkeys. Therefore, the number of animals that are not monkeys is:  79 - 24 = 55.  So, there are 55 animals that do not have tails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 171 children in the park and 134 of them have been vaccinated today. So, the number of unvaccinated children is:  171 - 134 = 37. Now, we need to find out how many children will be left after tomorrow if 30 more children are vaccinated tomorrow. To do this, we subtract 30 from the remaining number of unvaccinated children:  37 - 30 = 7. Therefore, there will be 7 children left unvaccinated after tomorrow.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 160 ducks in total and 56 ducks were collected yesterday. Therefore, the number of ducks left today is:  
160 - 56 = 104  Next, we know that 41 ducks were collected today. So, the number of ducks left after collecting 41 ducks is:  
104 - 41 = 63  Finally, we need to find out how many ducks will be left after tomorrow's collection. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of ducks collected today (41) from the remaining ducks (63):  
63 - 41 = 22  Therefore, there will be 22 ducks left after tomorrow's collection."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 90 ducks in the pond and 154 ducklings hatched today. So, if we subtract the number of ducklings from the total number of ducks, we get:  90 - 154 =?  The result is:  90 - 154 = -64  This means that there are 64 fewer ducklings than ducks.  Now, let's consider the number of ducklings tomorrow. We know that there will be 50 more ducklings tomorrow. So, if we add 50 to the current number of ducklings, we get:  64 + 50 =?  The result is:  64 + 50 = 114  Therefore, there will be 114 ducklings tomorrow.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 175 children in the school and 77 of them are playing in the park. So, the number of children who are not playing in the park is:  175 - 77 = 98. Now, if we subtract the number of children who are playing in the park from the total number of children in the school, we get:  98 + 77 = 175. Therefore, the number of children who are left after taking away those who are playing in the park is:  175 - 77 = 98.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 177 chickens in total and 12 ducks in the pond. So, if we subtract the number of ducks from the total number of birds, we get:  177 - 12 = 165  Now, we need to find out how many chickens will be left after Khun Lek collects 53 chickens. To do this, we can subtract 53 from 165:  165 - 53 = 112  Therefore, there will be 112 chickens left after Khun Lek collects 53 chickens.
Response:  First, we know that there are 105 green frogs and 71 red frogs in the pond.  If we add both numbers together, we get 176 frogs.   Next, we know that if the frog eats all of the other frogs, he will have 137 frogs left over (since 137 is the difference between the total number of frogs and the number of green and red frogs combined).  So, to find out how many frogs the frog will have after eating all of the other frogs, we can subtract 137 from 176:  176 - 137 =?  The answer is 39.  Therefore, the frog will have 39 frogs left over after eating all of the other frogs.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four windows in total, and each window needs two pieces of plywood to cover it. Therefore, we need 4 x 2 = 8 pieces of plywood for all four windows.  
However, since we want to leave some space between each piece of plywood to ensure proper ventilation, let's assume we will use one-third of the width of each piece as space between them. So, if we divide each piece into three equal parts, we will have 8 x 3 = 24 sections for each window.  Now, we can calculate how many sheets of plywood we need based on this calculation: 24 sections per window x 4 windows = 96 sheets of plywood in total."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many square meters of land are needed for each type of tree. For large trees (13 meters tall), we need to use 17 square meters of land per tree to ensure stability and safety. Therefore, we need 17 x 5 = 85 square meters of land for five large trees. For small trees (less than 10 meters tall), we can use 8 square meters of land per tree, so we need 8 x 2 = 16 square meters of land for two small trees. In total, we need 85 + 16 = 101 square meters of land for all seven trees.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many square meters of roofing material are needed for each house. To do this, we divide the area of each house (in square meters) by the number of layers of roofing material used. So, for House A, we have: Area = 20 x 15 = 300 square meters and Number of Layers = 3 Therefore, we need 300 / 3 = 100 square meters of roofing material for House A. For House B, we have: Area = 40 x 20 = 800 square meters and Number of Layers = 4 Therefore, we need 800 / 4 = 200 square meters of roofing material for House B. Now, let's add up the total amount of roofing material needed for both houses: Total Area = 100 + 200 = 300 square meters. Since we want to use 11 different colors for each house, we will need 300 x 11 = 3,300 tiles in total.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many square meters of tiles are needed for each type of floor. For the large floor area (12 x 10 = 120 sqm), we will use 15 cm x 15 cm tiles, so we need:  120 sqm / (15 cm x 15 cm) = 800 tiles For the small floor area (10 x 5 = 50 sqm), we will use 15 cm x 15 cm tiles as well, so we need:  50 sqm / (15 cm x 15 cm) = 333 tiles In total, we need 800 + 333 = 1133 tiles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jong will use large leaves for his house.  Secondly, he needs to use 2 sheets of tarpaulin for each leaf to cover and protect it from rain. Therefore, the total number of sheets of tarpaulin needed for all the leaves is:  2 x (number of leaves) = 2 x 16 = 32 sheets of tarpaulin.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 sheets of plywood needed for the roof.  Each sheet is 4 feet wide and 8 feet long, so the total area of each sheet is 4 x 8 = 32 square feet.  Now, we need to calculate how many sheets of plywood are required for the walls.  We know that the wall height is 7 feet, and we want to cover it with 3 layers of 2x4 lumber, which means we need to cover an area of 7 x 3 = 21 square feet per layer.  Since we have 3 layers, we need a total of 21 x 3 = 63 square feet of plywood for the walls.  Therefore, the total number of sheets of plywood required for the house is  8 (roof) + 63 (walls) = 71 sheets.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many square meters of land are needed for each type of tree. For large trees, we need to use 14 square meters per tree and for small trees, we need to use 25 square meters per tree. Next, we need to determine how many trees of each size should be planted based on the total area available. The total area is 1200 square meters (12 x 100). Therefore, we can calculate as follows:   Large Trees: 1200 sqm / 14 sqm/tree = 86 trees Small Trees: 1200 sqm / 25 sqm/tree = 48 trees So, in total, there will be 86 large trees and 48 small trees that can be planted on the 1200-square meter plot of land.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin has 3 chests in each pack and altogether he has 42 chests of loot. So, if we divide 42 by 3, we get:  42 / 3 = 14 Therefore, Robin has 14 packs of loot.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 43 students in total and each group has 23 chairs. So, if we divide 43 by 23, we get:  43 / 23 = 1 With a remainder of 8. Therefore, there are 1 complete group (with 23 chairs) and 8 extra students who cannot fit into any one group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 chickens in each pack. Therefore, if there are x packs of chickens, then there will be 7x chickens in total. Additionally, we know that there are 6 extra chickens not included in any pack. So, the total number of chickens is 7x + 6. To find out how many packs of chickens there are, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. We know that the total number of chickens is 41. Therefore, our equation would be:  7x + 6 = 41 Now solve for x to find out how many packs of chickens there are. In this case, we can easily see that 7x = 35 (since 7 times 5 is equal to 35). Therefore, x = 5. This means that there are 5 packs of chickens with 7 chickens in each pack, and 6 extra chickens not included in any pack. The final answer is: There are 5 packs of chickens with 7 chickens in each pack, and 6 extra chickens not included in any pack.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 boxes in total and each box has 4 chins. Therefore, to find out how many chins Robbin has in total, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of chins per box:  28 x 4 = 112  So, Robbin has 112 chins in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 children in Robot's class and each child has 9 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys is 21 x 9 = 189 toys. Next, we know that there are 45 children in the other class and each child also has 9 toys. So, the total number of toys for this class is 45 x 9 = 405 toys. In total, there are 189 + 405 = 694 toys.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 compartments in total and each compartment has 6 chinchillas. Therefore, to find out how many chinchillas there are in total, we can multiply the number of compartments by the number of chinchillas in each compartment:  28 compartments x 6 chinchillas per compartment = 168 chinchillas.
Response: 1) The machine can make 3 shirts per hour. 2) To make 6 shirts, we need to work for 2 hours (2 x 3 = 6).   Therefore, the time required to make 6 shirts is 2 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can make 4 pieces of jewelry in 1 hour. Therefore, it can produce 4 x 60 = 240 pieces of jewelry per hour. However, the problem asks for the number of pieces of jewelry that can be made in 5 minutes, not in an hour. So, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:  5 minutes = 5 x 60 / 1 = 300 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute) Now, we can calculate the number of pieces of jewelry that can be made in 5 minutes as follows:  Number of pieces of jewelry in 5 minutes = 240 pieces/hour x 300 seconds / 60 minutes = 480 pieces of jewelry In conclusion, the machine can produce 480 pieces of jewelry in 5 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many minutes are needed for each piece of clothing based on the given information. We have 9 pieces of clothing in total and 44 minutes available for sewing. Therefore, we can calculate the time required for each piece as follows: Time per piece = Total time / Number of pieces Time per piece = 44 minutes / 9 pieces = 5 minutes per piece Now, let's move on to the second part of the question, which asks us to determine how long it would take to make 3 pieces at once. To do this, we simply need to multiply the time required for one piece by the number of pieces being made simultaneously: Time to make 3 pieces = Time per piece x Number of pieces Time to make 3 pieces = 5 minutes/piece x 3 pieces = 15 minutes So, it would take 15 minutes to make 3 pieces of clothing at once.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many minutes it takes to make one shirt. We know that each shirt requires 13 stitches and 3 tucks, so let's assume that making one shirt takes 16 minutes (13 x 2 + 3). Now, we want to find out how long it would take to make 8 shirts in total. To do this, we can simply multiply the number of shirts by the time taken to make one shirt: 8 shirts x 16 minutes/shirt = 128 minutes or 2 hours and 8 minutes. Therefore, it would take approximately 2 hours and 8 minutes to make 8 shirts.
Response:  We have 9 tasks to do in the morning and 8 tasks to do in the afternoon. To calculate how many hours it takes to complete all the tasks, we need to know how long each task takes. So, let's assume that each task takes an average of 30 minutes (this is just an assumption).  🤔 Now, let's calculate the total time required to complete all the tasks for both the morning and afternoon sessions. Morning Session: 9 tasks x 30 minutes/task = 270 minutes (or 4.5 hours) Afternoon Session: 8 tasks x 30 minutes/task = 240 minutes (or 4 hours) 📝 Total Time Required: 4.5 hours + 4 hours = 8.5 hours  Therefore, it would take approximately 8.5 hours to complete all the tasks if each task takes 30 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can make 3 shirts in 1 minute. Therefore, the speed of the machine is 3 shirts per minute. Now, let's calculate how many minutes it takes to make 4 shirts and 8 shirts.   For 4 shirts: We know that there are 4 shirts in total, so we divide the number of shirts by the speed of the machine: 4 shirts / 3 shirts/minute = 1.33 minutes (approximately) It means that the machine will take approximately 1.33 minutes to make 4 shirts.   For 8 shirts: We know that there are 8 shirts in total, so we divide the number of shirts by the speed of the machine: 8 shirts / 3 shirts/minute = 2.67 minutes (approximately) It means that the machine will take approximately 2.67 minutes to make 8 shirts.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can make 6 shirts in one hour (12 minutes). Therefore, if we want to calculate how many shirts the machine can produce in total, we need to multiply the number of hours it operates per day by the number of shirts it produces per hour.  
So, if the machine operates for 8 hours per day (as mentioned in the problem), then the total number of shirts it can produce in a day is:  
Total Shirts = Number of Hours x Number of Shirts per Hour  
= 8 hours x 12 minutes/hour  
= 960 minutes/day x 12 minutes/hour  
= 11520 shirts/day  
Therefore, the machine can produce 11520 shirts in one day."
Response:  If the machine can make 6 shirts in one hour, it means that it produces 6/hour = 0.67 shirts per minute (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Now, if we want to know how many shirts the machine can produce in 5 minutes, we multiply the number of shirts per minute by the number of minutes: 0.67 x 5 = 3.35 shirts. Therefore, the machine can produce 3.35 shirts in 5 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each day of work is worth 32,500 baht (165,000 baht / 5 days). Therefore, if they worked for 5 days, their total earnings would be:  32,500 x 5 = 162,500 baht.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 144 dolla...
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 days in the month and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a month is 30 x 24 = 720 hours.   Next, we need to calculate how many baht the group can earn from their work every hour. We know that they can earn 420 baht per hour from their game development work. Therefore, the total amount they can earn per hour is 420 baht. Now, let's multiply the total number of hours in a month (720 hours) by the amount they can earn per hour (420 baht): 720 hours x 420 baht/hour = 306,400 baht. Finally, we add the additional income they receive from other games (22,000 baht), which gives us a grand total of: 306,400 baht + 22,000 baht = 328,400 baht.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many days are in total for both periods of time (44 days and 10 days). Total number of days = 44 + 10 = 54 days. Next, we need to calculate how much work is done during each period of time. For the first period of 44 days, the amount of work done can be calculated as follows: Work done = Number of workers x Days worked x Productivity per day. In this case, the productivity per day is given as 382 dolalrs/day. Therefore, Work done = 382 x 44 x 1 = 16,992 dollars. Similarly, for the second period of 10 days, the amount of work done can be calculated as follows: Work done = Number of workers x Days worked x Productivity per day. In this case, the productivity per day is also given as 382 dolalrs/day. Therefore, Work done = 382 x 10 x 1 = 3,820 dollars. Finally, we add up the total amount of work done during both periods to get our final answer: Total work done = 16,992 + 3,820 = 20,812 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days in the first 20 working days (excluding weekends and holidays). We can do this by multiplying the number of working days per month (assuming there are 20 working days in each month) by the number of months in the period (in this case, 2 months): Total working days in the first 20 days = Number of working days per month x Number of months in the period = 20 x 2 = 40 days Next, we need to calculate the average daily income for the first 20 working days. To do this, we divide the total amount earned during that period by the total number of working days: Average daily income in the first 20 days = Total amount earned / Total working days = 120,000 / 40 = 3,000 THB per day Finally, we can calculate the total amount earned in the first 16 weeks by multiplying the average daily income by the number of working days in each week: Total amount earned in the first 16 weeks = Average daily income x Number of working days per week x Number of weeks = 3,000 x 5 x 16 = 96,000 THB Therefore, the total amount earned in the first 16 weeks is 96,000 THB.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many days are in each period of time:  154 weeks x 7 days/week = 1098 days (first period) and 57 weeks x 7 days/week = 399 days (second period). Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned during each period:  1098 days x $325/day = $361,500 (first period) and 399 days x $325/day = $128,250 (second period). Finally, we add up the two amounts to get the grand total: $361,500 + $128,250 = $489,750. So, the total amount of money earned over the entire 57-week period is $489,750.
Response:  Firstly, we know that เธอ (Thu) bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cakes. So, in total, she spent 10 x 50 = 500 baht on cookies and 4 x 200 = 800 baht on cakes. Therefore, the total amount Thu spent is 500 + 800 = 1300 baht.
Response:  Firstly, we know that เธอ (Thu) bought 4 packs of cookies. Each pack contains 22 pieces, so Thu bought 4 x 22 = 88 cookies in total. Next, we know that she also bought 16 packs of chocolate. Each pack contains 16 pieces, so Thu bought 16 x 16 = 256 pieces of chocolate in total. Therefore, the total number of items Thu bought is 88 + 256 = 344.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tham bought 23 packets of cookies and 27 packets of crackers in total. Next, we need to find out how many packets of each type she bought. We can start by dividing the total number of packets she bought by the number of packets of each type. So, for the cookies, we have:  23 / 27 = 0.85 (approximately) This means that Tham bought approximately 85% of cookies and 15% of crackers. Therefore, she bought 23 x 0.85 = 19.5 packets of cookies and 23 x 0.15 = 3.45 packets of crackers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that she bought 2 packets of cookies and 12 packs of chips. Secondly, each packet of cookies contains 8 pieces, so she bought 2 x 8 = 16 pieces of cookies. Thirdly, each pack of chips contains 12 pieces, so she bought 12 x 12 = 96 pieces of chips. Therefore, in total, she bought 16 + 96 = 112 snacks.
Response:  Firstly, there are 12 people in the room already.   Secondly, four more people enter the room, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in total.  However, since each person can only receive up to three stickers, we need to subtract the number of stickers received by each person from the total number of people.  So, if each person receives three stickers, we have:  16 - (3 x 12) = 16 - 36 = 0 people left over.  Therefore, there are zero people left over after everyone has received their stickers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 people who have not gone home yet.  Next, we know that there are 12 more people coming to join them. So, in total, how many people will be on the bus?  8 + 12 = 20 people. Therefore, there will be 20 people on the bus.
Response:  First, we know that there are 4 people in the first car.  Next, we know that there are 13 more people added to the second car.  So, if we add 13 to 4, we get:  4 + 13 = 17  Therefore, there are 17 people in the second car.
Response:  First, we know that there were 8 people in the car at first. Then, 3 more people got into the car, so now there are 8 + 3 = 11 people in the car. Therefore, there are 11 people in the car now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 people in the program and 676 people in total. So, to find out how many students joined the program, we can subtract the number of people who are not in the program from the total number of people.  676 - 22 =?  The answer is 654. Therefore, 654 students joined the program.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 73 teachers, so they cannot be included in the total number of people who have joined the program. Therefore, the total number of people who have joined the program is 724 + 744 = 1468 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 174 people in the program and 521 students in total. Next, we need to find out how many more students will be added when the program is fully subscribed. To do this, we can subtract the number of people in the program from the total number of students:  521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, when the program is fully subscribed, there will be 347 more students than there are currently in the program.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 61 people in the program and 177 students in total. Next, we need to find out how many of those students have joined the program. The problem states that 44 people have joined the program, so we can subtract that number from the total number of students to get the remaining students who haven't joined the program.  177 - 44 =?  That gives us 133 students who haven't joined the program. Therefore, the answer is 133.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between point A (919 ft) and point B (1307 ft) is 1307 - 919 = 388 ft. Secondly, since they have to walk along the path, they will not be able to go directly from point A to point B. They will have to walk around the obstacle, which means they will cover an additional distance of approximately half the circumference of the circle inscribed within the triangle formed by points A, B, and C (see diagram). The length of this additional distance can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle: Circumference = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius of the circle is half the distance between points A and B, i.e., 388/2 = 194 ft. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the group of people would be: Total Distance = Distance between A and B + Additional Distance = 388 + 194 = 582 ft. So, the group of people would need to travel approximately 582 feet to reach their destination.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the group of people is 1218 feet and they have been walking for 849 feet. So, the remaining distance to be covered is:  1218 - 849 = 369 feet. Now, if they walk at a speed of 17 feet per minute, how many minutes will it take them to cover this remaining distance? We can calculate this as follows:  369 / 17 = 21 minutes. Therefore, it will take them 21 minutes to cover the remaining distance of 369 feet.
Response:  First, we know that the height of the staircase is 659 feet (201 meters). Next, we are given that the building has 762 feet (232 meters) of usable floor space. This means that the total height of the building, including the foundation and any other features below ground level, is greater than 659 feet. To find out how much greater, we need to subtract the height of the staircase from the total height of the building. Doing so gives us: Total height of building - Height of staircase =?  Solution: We can set up an equation based on the information given: Total height of building - Height of staircase = 762 ft - 659 ft = 103 ft or 31 meters. Therefore, the building has 103 feet (31 meters) more height than the staircase.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 tigers in total and each tiger eats 8 fish per day. So, if we divide 6 by 8, we get 3/4 of a whole number. Therefore, there will be 3 tigers left with no fish to eat after one day.  
Question: How many fish will the remaining 3 tigers have to share among themselves?  Answer: If there are 3 tigers left and each tiger needs to eat 8 fish per day, then they will need to share 24 fish (8 x 3) among themselves."
Response:  There are 7 fish in the bowl and 12 ducks in the pond. If there were 15 fish altogether, then there would be 7 + 8 = 15 fish. However, since the cat only ate 3 of them, there must have been 7 + 3 = 10 fish initially. So, there are 10 - 3 = 7 fish left in the bowl now.
Response:  There are 16 pieces of fish in total (16 x 2 = 32). If there were only 2 cats eating them, each cat would have to eat 16/2 = 8 pieces of fish. However, since there are 71 pieces of fish left over after the cats finished eating, we know that the number of cats must be greater than 2. So, the correct answer is 3 cats.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 pieces of fish in total.  Secondly, we know that the cat only eats 5 pieces. So, if we subtract the number of pieces eaten by the cat from the total number of pieces, we get:  15 - 5 = 10  Therefore, there are 10 pieces of fish left after the cat finishes eating.
Response:  If the first child has 43 toys and each child gets half of them, then the second child will get half of 43, which is 21 toys.   Therefore, the second child will have 21 toys.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 58 children in total and 35 of them have already been chosen. So, to find out how many more children need to be chosen, we can subtract 35 from 58:  58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 more children who need to be chosen.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 children in the class and each child has 54 lunches. Therefore, the total number of lunches is 40 x 54 = 2160 lunches. Now, if 39 children eat 39 lunches each, then the total number of lunches eaten is 39 x 39 = 1761 lunches. So, the remaining lunches left over would be 2160 - 1761 = 409 lunches.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many books can be placed in each shelf based on the number of shelves and the height of each shelf. There are 4 shelves with a total height of 40 inches (4 x 10 = 40). Each book is 2 inches tall, so we can place 20 books per shelf (40 / 2 = 20). Now, let's calculate how many books can be placed in the entire room. We have 4 shelves with 20 books per shelf, for a total of 80 books (4 x 20 = 80)
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 acorns in total and each hole can only hold 8 acorns. So, we need to find out how many holes are needed to store all the acorns.   To do this, we divide the number of acorns by the number of acorns per hole:  10 acorns / 8 acorns per hole = 10/8 = 125 holes! Therefore, we need 125 holes to store all the acorns.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many shelves can be placed in each room based on the height of the room and the size of the shelves. We know that there are four rooms with different heights, so we will have to calculate separately for each room.   Room 1: Height = 250 cm (2.5 m) Shelf size = 80 cm x 60 cm (width x depth) Number of shelves per room = Total height / Shelf size Number of shelves per room = 250 cm / (80 cm x 60 cm) Number of shelves per room = 31.25 (or approximately 31) Room 2: Height = 300 cm (3 m) Shelf size = 80 cm x 60 cm (width x depth) Number of shelves per room = Total height / Shelf size Number of shelves per room = 300 cm / (80 cm x 60 cm) Number of shelves per room = 37.5 (or approximately 38) Room 3: Height = 350 cm (3.5 m) Shelf size = 80 cm x 60 cm (width x depth) Number of shelves per room = Total height / Shelf size Number of shelves per room = 350 cm / (80 cm x 60 cm) Number of shelves per room = 43.75 (or approximately 44) Room 4: Height = 400 cm (4 m) Shelf size = 80 cm x 60 cm (width x depth) Number of shelves per room = Total height / Shelf size Number of shelves per room = 400 cm / (80 cm x 60 cm) Number of shelves per room = 50 (or approximately 50) Now, let's add up all the numbers to find out the total number of shelves required for all four rooms: Total number of shelves = Number of shelves per room x Number of rooms Total number of shelves = 31 + 37.5 + 43.75 + 50 = 1
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 544 trees in each garden.  Secondly, we know that each tree has 32 branches. Therefore, to find out how many branches there are in total, we need to multiply the number of gardens (544) by the number of trees per garden (32). So, the calculation is as follows:  544 x 32 =?  Can you solve for the answer?
Response:  First, we know that there are 466 trees in total. Next, we know that each tree has an average of 53 branches and 181 leaves. So, to find out how many branches and leaves there are in total, we can multiply the number of trees by the average number of branches and leaves per tree.  For branches:  466 trees x 53 branches/tree = 24,978 branches For leaves:  466 trees x 181 leaves/tree = 86,066 leaves Therefore, there are 24,978 branches and 86,066 leaves in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 141 trees in total. Secondly, each tree has an average of 71 branches. Finally, each branch has an average of 91 leaves. So, to find out how many leaves there are in total, we need to multiply the number of trees by the number of branches per tree and then by the number of leaves per branch. Therefore, the total number of leaves is:  141 x 71 x 91 = 106,211 leaves.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each tree has 40 flowers. Therefore, if there are 400 trees, the total number of flowers is 40 x 400 = 16,000 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4502 students in total and each class has 4276 students. So, the number of classes is:  4502 / 4276 = 1 Now, let's find out how many groups of 154 students can be formed from these classes. We need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group (154):  4502 / 154 = 29 Therefore, there can be 29 groups of 154 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3941 students in the class and each student has 4950 books to arrange. So, the total number of books is 3941 x 4950 = 182,675 books. Now, we need to divide these books into groups of 495 books each (since there are 495 books per group). To do this, we can use division.  182,675 / 495 = 365 groups of 495 books each. Therefore, there will be 365 groups of 495 books each in the library.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 896 students in total and they are divided into 8 groups of equal size. Therefore, each group has 896/8 = 112 students. Next, we need to find out how many classes each group will have if there are 517 desks available and each class has 90 students. We can calculate this as follows:  517 / 90 = 5.74 (round up to the nearest whole number) So, each group will have approximately 6 classes. Finally, we need to determine the size of each group. Since there are 8 groups, and each group has approximately 6 classes, the total number of classes is 8 x 6 = 48 classes. Therefore, the size of each group is 896 / 48 = 18 students per group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, if we divide 270 by 5, we get:  270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 304 students in total and each grade has 75 students. So, if we divide 304 by 75, we get:  304 ÷ 75 = 4 Therefore, there are 4 classes of students in the school.
