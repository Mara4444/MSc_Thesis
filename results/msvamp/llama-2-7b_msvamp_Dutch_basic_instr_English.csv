"Response: 71

Explanation:
The passage states that ""86 vogelfamilies vlogen weg voor de winter van een berg."" If there were 45 vogelfamilies living near the mountain before they left for winter, then the number of vogelfamilies that left for winter is equal to the total number of vogelfamilies minus the number of vogefamilies living near the mountain. Therefore, the answer is 71 (86 - 45)."
Response: 62
"Response: 3

Response: 204 (177 - 55 = 204)
"Response: 28
Explanation:  According to the question, Paul gave away 111 of his 440 color pencils to his friends, which means he has 329 left (440 - 111 = 329). Then, he lost 106 of those pencils, leaving him with 28 (329 - 106 = 28) remaining."
"Response: 16

Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 213 potatoes and lost/gave away 16 potatoes, so there were 16 fewer potatoes than he started with."
"Response: 20

"Response: 412 - 90 = 322

Question:  Paul had 110 colored pencils in a box and gave 90 to his friends. How many more pencils did he have than he gave away?

Therefore, Paul had 20 more pencils than he gave away."
"Response: 104
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 563 color pencils and lost 558. This means he has 332 left. If he received 104 color pencils for his birthday, then he must have had 332 - 104 = 228 color pencils initially."
"Response: 107
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 52 potatoes and lost or gave away 535 potatoes, leaving him with 492 potatoes. Therefore, there were 107 potatoes that were either lost or given away."
"Response: 187
Explanation:
Let's call the number of color pencils Kreeg received as $x$. Since he had $x$ at the beginning of the year and $x - 154$ at the end of the year, we can write an equation:
$$x - 154 = 521 - 66 + 187$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$x = 301$$
Therefore, there were $301$ color pencils lost or given away during the year."
"Response: 391
Explanation: According to the question, Paul started with 531 color pencils and 38 gummies. At the end of the school year, he had 391 left, which means that he lost 140 (531 - 391 = 140) color pencils and all 38 gummies."
"Response: 265
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paul received 601 color pencils and 406 gummies as his gift.
* At the end of the school year, he had 336 left without losing any.

So, the number of color pencils he had at the start of the school year is:
601 - 336 = 265

Therefore, Paul has 265 color pencils left."
Response: 291
"Response: 54
Explanation:
Paul lost 231 potatoes and gave 308 to his friends. So he had 231 - 308 = -177 less potatoes than he started with. Since he gave more potatoes away than he lost, the difference between the number of potatoes he gave away and the number he lost is positive. Therefore, the answer is 54."
"Response: 107
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Paul received a box with 457 gummies and 320 colorful pencils as a gift for his birthday.
* At the end of the school year, he had 523 items left without losing any.

Now, let's calculate how many pencils Paul had at the beginning:

Number of pencils = Total number of pencils - Number of pencils lost during the school year
= 320 - 0 (since no pencils were lost)
= 320

So, Paul had 320 pencils at the beginning of the school year.

To find out how many pencils he had at the end of the school year, we can subtract the number of pencils he used during the year from the initial amount:

Number of pencils at the end of the school year = Initial number of pencils - Number of pencils used during the school year
= 320 - 0 (since no pencils were used during the year)
= 320

Therefore, Paul had 320 pencils at the end of the school year."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
The Ober had 11 customers at first and lost 3 of them after a few trips. Therefore, there are more customers left behind than those who have departed. The difference between the number of customers left behind (11) and the number of customers who have departed (3) is equal to 8. So, there are 8 more customers left behind than those who have departed."

Response: 3
"Response: 9
Explanation: The Ober has 9 customers left after 5 more customers have arrived."
"Response: 5
Explanation:
The Ober had 13 customers initially and lost some of them after a few departures. If he gained 4 new customers, then the total number of customers would be 13 + 4 = 17. Since the Ober still had 9 customers at the end, there were 17 - 9 = 8 customers remaining."
"Response: 8
Explanation: The Ober had 12 customers initially and lost 15 customers. So he has 12 - 15 = -3 customers left. Then, he gained 14 new customers, so he now has 8 customers (8 = 12 + 14)."
Response: 4 new customers.
"Response: 4
Explanation:
The Ober has 8 customers initially. After a few departures, he still has 5 customers left. Then, he gets 99 new customers. To find out how many customers are left, we need to subtract the number of departures (5) from the total number of customers (8 + 5 = 13). So, there are 13 - 5 = 8 customers remaining."

"Response: 59

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that Paul sold some books in a garage sale and made $27 from it. If he had 136 books to sell, then he must have sold 59 of them (136 - 27 = 59)."
"Response: 27

Explanation:
The statement ""Paul had 134 books"" implies that he started with a total of 134 books. The phrase ""na 39 boeken aan een vriend te hebben gegeven"" means that he gave away 39 books to a friend, leaving him with 95 books. Then, the sentence ""en een paar boeken te hebben verkocht"" indicates that he sold a few more books, reducing his remaining number of books by an unknown amount. Finally, the statement ""had hij nog 68 boeken over"" tells us that after all these transactions, he was left with 68 books. Therefore, we can conclude that Paul sold 27 books."
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul had 153 books and 95 pens before the garage sale. After selling some of his items at the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. To find out how many books he sold during the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he still has (13) from the original number of books he had (153): 153 - 13 = 140. So, Paul sold 140 books during the garage sale."

* 68 children got off the bus at the stop.
* More children got on the bus while some were getting off.
* In total, there were 12 children left in the bus.

To find out how many children got off the bus, we need to subtract the number of children who got off (68) from the initial number of children in the bus (36). This gives us 32 children who got off the bus."

"Response: 36
Explanation:
The baker made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, leaving him with 16 tarts (121 - 105 = 16). He then bought 170 new tarts, so he now has 16 + 170 = 186 tarts in total."
Response: 236 - 91 = 145 more koekjes were bought than sold by Baker.
"Response: 42

The information given in the question is as follows:
De bakker maakte 170 taarten. (He made 170 tarts)
Hij verkocht er 78 en kocht 31 nieuwe. (He sold 78 and bought 31 new ones)
To find out how many more koekens (cookies) Baker has sold than he bought, we need to subtract the number of koekens he bought from the number of koekens he sold:
Number of koekens sold = 78 - Number of koekens bought
= 78 - 31
= 47
Therefore, Baker has sold 47 more koekens than he bought."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
The first sentence states that Bakker made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. This means he has 35 unsold tarts left (110 - 75 = 35). The second sentence states that he made an additional 76 tarts after selling 75. So, in total, he now has 35 + 76 = 111 tarts. Since he sold 75 tarts, he still has 111 - 75 = 36 tarts left."
"Response: 53

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
De bakker maakte 144 taarten. Hij verkocht er 71. Toen maakte hij nog 111 taarten.
From this information, we can calculate that Baker made a total of 262 taarts (144 + 111). However, he only sold 71 tarts, which means that he made more tarts than he sold by 191 tarts (262 - 71)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, de bakker made 149 tarts and 91 pastries. If he sold 10 cakes and 90 pastries, then he would have 5 cakes left (149 - 10 = 139; 91 - 90 = 1)."

De bakker maakte 7 taarten en 148gebakjes. (He made 7 pies and 148 pastries.)
Als hij 15 cakes en 103gebakjes verkocht (As he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries.)
To find out how many pastries Baker would have left, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries made by him.
So, the number of pastries Baker would have left = Total number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold
= 148 - 15 + 103
= 96
Therefore, Baker would have 96 Gebakjes left."
Response: 39 more tarts than Gebak.
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. If he sold 70 tarts and 88 pastries, then he must have made more pastries than he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of pastries made by the baker (131) and the number of pastries sold (88) is 43."

The information provided in the question is that the Razorback t-shirt winkel verdient $23 per sold t-shirt and during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, they earned $230 from selling t-shirts. To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we can divide the amount earned by the price of each t-shirt:

$230 / $23 = 46

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt winkel sold 46 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game."
Response:  $17 each
"Response:  $362.00

Explanation:
The Razorback t-shirt store makes $87 per sold t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech games, they sold 95 t-shirts. Therefore, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they would have made $4195 ($87 x 47) in total from selling t-shirts that day."
"Response: 127
Explanation: According to the passage, the Razorback t-shirt winkel sold $106 per t-shirt. If they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold $106 x 115 = $12,340 during that game. Since they sold a total of 242 t-shirts during both games, they sold $12,340 / 2 = $6,170 during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  $89
"Response:  $1340
Explanation:
To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game (172) from the total number of T-shirts sold (186). This gives us $1340, which is the amount of money they made from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game."
Response: 4570 dollars.
Response:  $165 x 156 = $25,940
"Response:  $ 106

Explanation:
To find out how much a T-shirt costs more than a shirt, we need to subtract the price of a shirt from the price of a T-shirt. According to the passage, the price of a T-shirt is $ 192, and the price of a shirt is $ 34. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a T-shirt and a shirt is:

$ 192 - $ 34 = $ 158

So, a T-shirt costs $ 158 more than a shirt."
"Response:  $19
Explanation: According to the passage, the cost of a shirt is $86 more than the cost of a T-shirt. Therefore, if a T-shirt costs $x, then a shirt costs $x + 86. In this case, 254 T-shirts were sold for $232, so the cost of each T-shirt is $232 / 254 = $0.94 per unit. Since a shirt costs $86 more than a T-shirt, the cost of a shirt is $0.94 + $86 = $19 per unit."

Explanation: According to the question, the Razorback T-shirt shop earned $60 during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game by selling T-shirts. If they earn $10 per sold T-shirt, then they must have sold 60 T-shirts in total."
"Response:  $43

Explanation:
The total amount of money earned by the razorback T-shirt shop during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game is given as $215. If the shop sold 5 T-shirts, then the cost of each T-shirt can be found by dividing the total amount earned by the number of T-shirts sold: $215 ÷ 5 = $43 per T-shirt."
Response: 398 dollars.
Response:  $76
"Response:  $53

Explanation:
To find out how much a T-shirt costs more than a jersey, we need to subtract the price of a jersey from the price of a T-shirt. According to the question, the price of a T-shirt is $240, and the price of a jersey is $210. Therefore, the difference between the two prices is:

$240 - $210 = $30

So, a T-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey."
"Response:  $25
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the cost of each T-shirt is $25 and the cost of each trui is $115. Therefore, if a shirt costs more than a T-shirt, then the difference between the two prices must be positive. In this case, the difference is $90 ($115 - $25). So, a shirt costs $90 more than a T-shirt."

Response:  They have 78 chairs for their guests (12 sets x 14 chairs per set + 6 extra chairs).
"Response: 7
Explanation: Since there are four sets of tables and each set has three chairs, the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12. If there are 14 people attending the party, they will need an additional 2 chairs (12 + 2 = 14). Therefore, they must buy 7 more chairs."
Response: 14 x 9 = 126. Therefore, they have 126 chairs.

"Response: 30

Explanation:
Carol sent birthday invitations to 12 friends. Since she bought three packages with each containing the same number of invitations, there are 12 x 3 = 36 invitations in total. Therefore, there are 30 invitations in each package (since 36 / 3 = 30)."
"Response: 30

Response: 400 people can ride 20 giant Ferris wheels at once. Explanation: Each seat in each giant Ferris wheel can hold 15 people, so there are 19 seats in total (one for every 19 people). Therefore, if all 20 giant Ferris wheels are full of passengers, that means 380 people (19 x 15 = 295) can ride them at once. However, since we cannot have more than 400 people riding at once, the maximum number of people who can ride is 400.

Explanation: According to the question, there were 81 bottles of regular soda, 60 bottles of diet soda, and 60 bottles of light soda in the supermarket. Since there are more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we can conclude that the number of regular soda bottles is greater than the number of diet soda bottles by a margin of 31 (81 - 60 = 21). Therefore, the supermarket had 31 more bottles of regular soda than they did of diet soda."
"Response: 28 + 14 = 42

Question:  In een supermarkt waren 49 flessen gewone frisdrank 40 flessen dieet frisdrank en 6 flessen lichte frisdrank. Hoeveel flessen gewone en light frisdrank hadden ze in totaal?  
Solution:  To find out how many bottles of regular and light soda they had in total, we need to add up the number of bottles of each type. There were 49 bottles of regular soda, 40 bottles of diet soda, and 6 bottles of light soda, for a total of:

Regular soda: 49 bottles x 1 = 49
Diet soda: 40 bottles x 1 = 40
Light soda: 6 bottles x 1 = 6
Total: 49 + 40 + 6 = 95

Therefore, they had 95 bottles of soda in total, including both regular and light options."

"Response:  If there were 246 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day that Rachel visited, and there were 703 visitors the day before, then in 25 days there would have been a total of:

246 + (703 - 246) = 959 visitors to Buckingham Palace in 25 days."
"Response: 544
Explanation:
If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 666 visitors today, then there are 544 more visitors today than yesterday."
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before was 406.
"Response: 367

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday was 45.
* The total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 85 days is 829.

To find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day in question, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors on that day = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit
= 829 / 85
= 367

Therefore, the answer is 367 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day in question."
"Response: 3604
Explanation:
If there were 557 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day that Rachel visited and 188 visitors the previous day, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over 57 days is:

Total visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days
= 557 + (188 x 57)
= 3604
Therefore, the answer is 3604."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* There were 39 paintings in Buckingham Palace.
* 661 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day.
* The previous day there were 600 visitors.

To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on that day than the day before, we need to subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the current day's total:

Number of visitors on that day - Number of visitors the previous day = 661 - 600 = 41

Therefore, 41 more people visited Buckingham Palace on that day than the day before."
Response:  If there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 419 visitors the day before, then there were a total of 511 visitors to Buckingham Palace during those two days (419 + 92 = 511).
"Response: 3650

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* On the day after 512 visitors came to Buckingham Palace, there were 471 visitors the previous day.
* On the day before 808 visitors came to Buckingham Palace, there were no visitors the day before that (as stated in the problem).

Using these pieces of information, we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over an 89-day period as follows:

Day 1: 512 visitors
Day 2: 471 visitors - 512 = -61 visitors
Day 3: 808 visitors + 61 = 869 visitors
Day 4: 869 visitors + 0 = 869 visitors
...
Day 89: 869 visitors x 89 = 75,511 visitors

Therefore, the answer to the question is 75,511."
"Response: 368

Explanation:
To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (191) from the total number of visitors that day (705). This gives us:

705 - 191 = 514

So, there were 514 more visitors at Buckingham Palace that day than during the previous 245 days."

Response: 12 vaten druiven per dag.
Response: 18 vaten/day
"Response: 5380 vaten

Explanation:
To find out how many vats of wine would be filled during the harvest season, we need to multiply the number of days by the amount of grapes picked per day. The question states that there are 294 pickers who will fill 244 vats of grapes per day, and since there are 146 days in the harvest season, we can calculate the total number of vats of grapes as follows:

Number of vats = Number of days x Amount of grapes picked per day
= 146 days x 244 vats/day
= 34,960 vats

Since each vat contains 47 vats of frambroos, the total number of vats of frambroos is:

Total number of vats of frambroos = Total number of vats x Number of vats of frambroos per vat
= 34,960 vats x 47 vats/vat
= 1,629,440 vats

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, there would be 5380 vats of wine filled during the harvest season."
Response: 469 vaten druiven.
Response: 694 vaten (108 x 58 = 694)
"Response: 75 days

Explanation:
The number of druivenplukkers (36) and the amount of druiven per day (8 vaten) are given in the problem statement. To find out how many days it will take to fill 240 vaten druiven, we need to divide the total amount of druiven by the number of plukkers and their daily output:

Number of days = Total amount of druiven / Number of plukkers x Daily output
= 240 vaten / 36 plukkers x 8 vaten/dag
= 75 dagen

Therefore, it will take approximately 75 days for 36 druivenplukkers to fill 240 vaten druiven."

Response: 10 houses. Explanation: According to the question, the postman has to deliver five pieces of junk mail to each block. If he gives 25 posts at each house in a block, then there are 10 houses in a block.
"Response: 36
Explanation:
If there are 20 houses in each block and the postman needs to give nine pieces of mail to each house, then he will need to give a total of 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of mail per block. Since there are 5 blocks, the total number of pieces of mail that the postman needs to give is 180 x 5 = 900 pieces of mail."
Response: 6 / 24 = 0.5 or 1/4 of the total number of pieces of mail to be delivered to each house.
Response: 28 houses are in one block.
Response: 760 stukjes (32 x 20).
"Response: 4.5
Explanation: To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will receive, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of houses in each block. There are 78 blocks in total, and since there are 19 houses in each block, each block has 78/19 = 4.26 houses. Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 30 / 4.26 = 7.1 pieces of junk mail to each house on average."
"Response: 104 houses
Explanation:
The postman gives 32 pieces of mail to each of the 55 blocks, which means he delivers a total of 32 x 55 = 1760 pieces of mail overall. Since each block has 8 houses, there are 1760 / 8 = 220 blocks in total. Therefore, there are 55 blocks and 220 houses per block, for a total of 104 houses in all."
"Response: 32
Explanation: Since there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses, the total number of houses is 81 x 12 = 972. As the postman needs to give four pieces of mail to each house, the total number of pieces of mail he needs to deliver is 972 x 4 = 3888. Therefore, the postman needs to give 3888 pieces of junk mail in each of the 81 blocks."

Response: 20 planks are needed for the wall. Explanation: According to the question, each plank requires two spikes to be fastened, and there are four spikes used in total by John. Therefore, if each plank needs two spikes, then the number of planks required for the wall is equal to the number of spikes divided by the number of spikes per plank, which is 4 / 2 = 2. So, John needs 20 planks (2 x 10) for the wall.
"Response: 42

Explanation:
The number of spikes needed for the wall can be calculated as follows:
For the large planks (30 planks), each plank requires 17 spikes, so the total number of spikes required is:
30 planks x 17 spikes/plank = 510 spikes
For the smaller planks (8 planks), each plank requires 8 spikes, so the total number of spikes required is:
8 planks x 8 spikes/plank = 64 spikes
Therefore, in total, John needs 510 + 64 = 574 spikes to fasten all the planks for the wall."
Response: 4 planks are needed for the wall. Explanation: According to the information provided, each plank requires 3 spikes to be fastened, and there are 8 spikes left over after using them all up. Therefore, if we divide the number of remaining spikes by the number required per plank, we get 8 / 3 = 4 planks.
Response: 170 spikes are needed for the wall. Explanation: The total number of large planks used is 12 \* 15 = 180 planks. Since each large plank requires 15 spikes to be fixed, the total number of spikes required for the large planks is 180 \* 15 = 2700 spikes. Similarly, the total number of small planks used is 10 \* 5 = 50 planks. Since each small plank requires 5 spikes to be fixed, the total number of spikes required for the small planks is 50 \* 5 = 250 spikes. Therefore, the total number of spikes needed for the wall is 2700 + 250 = 170 spikes.
Response: 40 spikes (2 x 16 = 32 planks per wall x 2 spikes per plank).
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, John needs eight large wooden planks for the wall of his house. Each plank requires 74 screws to be fixed, so he will need a total of 8 x 74 = 596 screws in total."

Response:  The distance from the entrance of the cave to its end is 486 feet (1307 - 919 = 486).
Response:  The distance from the entrance of the cave to its end can be calculated as follows: Distance = Speed x Time + Initial Position = 17 km/h x (Time - 849 ft) + 849 ft = 1218 ft - 849 ft = 369 ft Therefore, it would take approximately 369 feet to reach the end of the cave if one flies at a speed of 17 kilometers per hour and starts from the entrance that is 849 feet deep.
Response:  To determine how far away from the entrance of the cave they are when they reach the end of the cave, we need to subtract the depth of the cave (762 feet) from their current height (659 feet). Therefore, they will reach the end of the cave at an altitude of 83 feet below the entrance.
