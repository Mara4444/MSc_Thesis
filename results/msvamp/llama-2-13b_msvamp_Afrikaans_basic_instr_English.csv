Response: 1 hour more (7 hours - 6 hours = 1 hour).
Response: 2 hours (Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and Chinese, so he spends 2 hours per day learning Chinese).
"Response: 
If Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 2 more hours on English than Chinese, then he spends 7 + 2 = 9 hours per day on English.
To find out how many hours he spends on Chinese, we can subtract the time spent on English from his total daily study time:
9 hours - 7 hours = 2 hours
Therefore, Ryan spends 2 hours per day on Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spent 5 hours per day learning Chinese and another couple of hours learning English. If he devoted 2 more hours to English than to Chinese, then he spent 5 + 2 = 7 hours per day learning English, and 5 - 2 = 3 hours per day learning Chinese."
Response: 30 hours (6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours).
Response: 12 hours (6 hours per day x 2 days)
Response: 24 hours x 6 days = 144 hours. If Ryan spends 4 hours per day on Chinese, then he has spent 4 x 6 = 24 hours studying Chinese over the past 6 days.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese. If he has been studying for 86 days, then he has spent:

4 hours/day x 86 days = 340 hours learning English
6 hours/day x 86 days = 510 hours learning Chinese
Total time spent learning both languages = 340 + 510 = 850 hours"
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, which is equal to 42 hours per week (6 x 7 = 42).
He spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese, which is equal to 49 hours per week (7 x 7 = 49).
He spends 3 hours per day learning Spanish, which is equal to 21 hours per week (3 x 7 = 21).
In total, Ryan spends 42 + 49 + 21 = 112 hours per week learning these three languages."
Response: 2 times more hours spent on English than Chinese.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours more on learning English than he does on learning Spanish. Therefore, if he spends x hours learning English, he spends (x + 2) hours learning Spanish."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Spanish, so he spends a total of 6 hours per day learning these two languages. He spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese, so he spends more time learning Chinese than Spanish. To calculate the exact amount of extra time he spends on Chinese, we can subtract the number of hours he spends on Spanish from the number of hours he spends on Chinese:

Chinese - Spanish = 5 hours - 4 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Ryan spends one additional hour per day learning Chinese compared to Spanish."
Response: 1 hour and 20 minutes (1hr 20min) per day.
"Response: 
Ryan learns English and Chinese for 7 days. He spends 4 hours each day learning English and 5 hours each day learning Chinese. To calculate the total number of hours he spends learning both languages, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of hours per day spent on each language. Therefore, the total number of hours Ryan spends learning English is:

7 days x 4 hours/day = 28 hours

And the total number of hours he spends learning Chinese is:

7 days x 5 hours/day = 35 hours

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 63 hours (28 + 35) learning both English and Chinese over the course of 7 days."

Response: 2 (Jerry had 2 action figures on his shelf initially).
Response: 4 + 22 = 26 action figures were in Jerry's rack initially. Then he added 6 more, so there were a total of 26 + 6 = 32 action figures in his rack.
Response: 7 (aksie figures) - 9 (boeke) = 8 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
"Response: 
Let's denote the number of books as B and the number of action figures as A. We know that Jerry had 2A + 10B books on his rack initially. Later, he added 4A more action figures, so the total number of items on the rack is:

2A + 10B + 4A = 6A + 10B

Now, we need to find out how many more books were there than action figures. To do this, we subtract the number of action figures from the total number of items:

6A + 10B - 4A = 2A + 10B

Simplifying, we get:

4A = 8B

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

B = 2A

So, there were twice as many books as action figures on Jerry's rack."
Response: 18 books were there in Jerry's rack.
Response: 7 (aksie figures) - 2 (boeke) = 5 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response: 9 - 5 = 4 more books than action figures were on Jerry's rack.
Response: 12 (8 + 4) - 5 = 12
Response: 4.
Response: 2 (two)
"Response: 
Jerry had initially placed two action figures on his shelf and later added seven more. If he has ten action figures on the shelf now, then he must have had two action figures at first."
"Response: 
There were 9 action figures on Jerry's shelf initially and he added 7 more later. So, the total number of action figures on his shelf now is:
9 + 7 = 16

Now, let's count how many books Jerry had on his shelf:
He had 10 books on his shelf.

So, there are more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf:
16 (action figures) > 10 (books)"
Response:  There were 3 books and 4 action figures on Jerry's shelf. If he added 2 more action figures to the shelf, then there would be 3 + 2 = 5 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, there were 1 more action figure than book on Jerry's shelf.
Response: 7 (books) - 3 (action figures) = 4 more books than action figures were on Jerry's shelf.

"Response: 
Ed lost 12 marbles (19 - 8 = 12)."
"Response: 
Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. If Ed lost 21 of his marbles on the playground, then he had 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left.
Since Doug had 30 marbles, Ed had 70 - 30 = 40 more marbles than Doug."
"Response: 
If Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug and lost 20 of his marbles on the playground, then:

Ed had 12 + 20 = 32 marbles initially
Ed lost 20 marbles, so he has 32 - 20 = 12 marbles left
Doug had 12 fewer marbles than Ed, so Doug has 12 marbles

Therefore, Doug has 12 marbles now."

Therefore, a total of 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in the proposals for new dishes."
"Response: 
To calculate how many more students preferred apple puree than those who preferred bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who preferred bacon from the total number of students.

Let's do that:

Total number of students = 257
Number of students who preferred bacon = 120

Now, let's subtract the number of students who preferred bacon from the total number of students:

257 - 120 =?

The result is:

257 - 120 = 137

So, 137 more students preferred apple puree than those who preferred bacon."
"Response: 
To calculate how many more students preferred apple puree than those who preferred chicken skewers, we need to subtract the number of students who preferred chicken skewers from the total number of students.

Let's do that:

Total number of students = 144 + 467 + 79 = 780

Number of students who preferred chicken skewers = 467

Therefore, the difference between the number of students who preferred apple puree and those who preferred chicken skewers is:

Difference = Total number of students - Number of students who preferred chicken skewers
= 780 - 467
= 313

So, there were 313 more students who preferred apple puree than those who preferred chicken skewers."
"Response: 
To calculate the difference in the number of students who preferred specific types of food, we need to subtract the number of students who preferred applesauce from the total number of students, then add the number of students who preferred meat and tamales.

Total number of students = 228 + 337 + 23 = 590

Number of students who preferred applesauce = 228

Difference = Total number of students - Number of students who preferred applesauce
= 590 - 228
= 362

Therefore, there were 362 more students who preferred meat and tamales combined than those who preferred applesauce."
"Response: 
Out of the 450 students who submitted proposals for new dishes, 38 students proposed adding meat to the menu, and the rest (412 students) did not propose any changes to the existing menu items."

"Response: 
To calculate the difference in the number of students who preferred aartappelpuree and those who preferred tamatiepuree, we need to subtract the number of students who preferred tamatiepuree from the number of students who preferred aartappelpuree.

Number of students who preferred aartappelpuree = 330
Number of students who preferred tamatiepuree = 76

Subtracting the two numbers gives us:

Difference = 330 - 76 = 254

Therefore, 254 more students preferred aartappelpuree than tamatiepuree."
"Response:  There are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls there are than boys, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls.

"Response:  There are 228 more girls than boys in the school. To find out how many boys there are, subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 697 (girls) + x (boys)

where x is the unknown number of boys.

Subtracting 697 from both sides gives us:

x = Total number of boys
= 697 - 228
= 469

Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school."
Response:  There are 510 more boys than girls in that school.

"Response:  There are 700 students in the school and there are 142 more boys than girls. To find out how many learners are in the school, we can add the number of boys to the number of girls. Let's do that:

Boys = 142 more than girls
Girls = 700 - 142 (since there are 142 more boys)

Therefore, the total number of learners in the school is:

Total learners = Girls + Boys
= 700 - 142 + 142
= 842

So, there are 842 learners in the school."
"Response:  There are currently 706 girls and 222 boys at the school, plus 418 more girls who have joined, for a total of:
706 + 222 + 418 = 1356 learners at the school."
Response: 902 + 44 = 946 meisies.
Response:  There are 632 girls and 410 boys in the school, so there are 632 - 410 = 222 more girls than boys in the school.

"Response: 315 + 309 = 624 (number of learners)
624 / 772 = 0.81 (fraction of people in the school)
0.81 x 100 = 81% (percentage of people in the school)"
"Response:  There are 739 girls in the school and we want to find out how many boys there are. Let's use subtraction to solve for the number of boys.

739 (girls) - x (boys) = 402 (more girls than boys)

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

x + 739 = 402 + 739

x + 739 = 1141

Subtracting 739 from both sides gives us:

x = 402

Therefore, there are 402 boys in the school."
Response: 700 learners (692 girls + 8 boys).
Response:  There are 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. If 403 more girls have joined the school, then there will be a total of 362 + 257 + 403 = 1022 students in the school. Therefore, there are 1022 - 362 = 660 more girls than boys in the school.

He had $12 left over, so he did not spend any more money on books or pens."
"Response: 
Edward spent $16 more on books than on pens. To find out how much he spent on books, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he spent:
$19 - $8 = $11
Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens."
"Response: 
Edward had $17 before he received $10 from his friend. Therefore, he had $17 - $10 = $7 before he spent any money."
"Response:  Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 more than Zachary, so together they did:

44 + 58 = 102 push-ups"
Response: 7 (Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups).
Response: 35 push-ups (9 more than Zachary's number)
"Response: 
David did 51 push-ups today at the gym. David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, together they did:
51 + 49 = 100 push-ups."
"Response: 
David has done 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups."
"Response: 
David has done 29 more push-ups than Zachary, but 13 fewer crunches. To find out how many crunches David did, we can subtract 13 from the number of crunches Zachary did:

Zachary did 17 crunches, so David did:

17 - 13 = 4 crunches

Therefore, David did 4 crunches."
Response: 53 + 14 = 67 push-ups and crunches.
"Response: 
Zachary has done 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, so his total is 35 + 3 = 38 exercises.
David has done 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so David's push-up count is:
58 + 35 = 93 push-ups

David has done 87 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David's crunch count is:
87 - 3 = 84 crunches

Therefore, Zachary has done 38 exercises (35 push-ups and 3 crunches), while David has done 93 push-ups and 84 crunches."
Response: 10 more push-ups (58 - 48 = 10).
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Zachary did 19 push-ups.
* David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary.
* John did 13 times fewer push-ups than David.

We can use this information to find out how many push-ups David did. Let's do it step by step:

Step 1: Find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that he did 19 push-ups.

Step 2: Find out how many push-ups David did by adding the number of push-ups Zachary did to the number of push-ups he did more than Zachary. So, we add 19 + 39 = 58 push-ups.

Step 3: Find out how many push-ups John did by subtracting the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups David did more than Zachary. So, we subtract 58 - 13 = 45 push-ups.

Therefore, David did 58 push-ups."
"Response: 
John did 4 fewer push-ups than David, who did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

David - John = (Zachary + 22) - 4

Solving for John's number of push-ups, we get:

John = (Zachary + 22) - 4
= 51 + 22 - 4
= 79

Therefore, John did 79 push-ups."
"Response: 
Zachary has done 15 push-ups. 
David has done 39 more than Zachary, so David has done 39 + 15 = 54 push-ups. 
John has done 9 fewer than David, so John has done 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups. 
Therefore, Zachary has done 15 more push-ups than John."
"Response: 
Zachary did 30 push-ups, so David did 37 - 30 = 7 more push-ups than Zachary."
"Response: 
David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary today at the gym. If David did 38 push-ups, how many push-ups did Zachary do?

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let Z be the number of push-ups that Zachary did. Then we can write the equation:

Z + D = 38... (1)
where D is the number of push-ups that David did.

We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write:

D = Z + 56... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how many push-ups Zachary did?"
"Response: 
David has done 40 - 17 = 23 crunches."
Response: 25 more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do today at the gym.
Response: 17 - 5 = 12 more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do today at the gym class.
Response: 3 bladsye (5 - 2 = 3).

Response: 2 more pages of mathematics homework need to be completed by Rachel if she has already finished 8 pages of it.
"Response: 
Rachel has 10 pages of math homework and needs to complete 3 more pages than her math homework. To find out how many pages she needs to complete in total, we can use subtraction.

10 - 3 = 7

Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 7 pages of math homework in total."
Response: 15 bladsye (3 + 10)
"Response: 
If Rachel had 9 pages of math homework and completed 2 pages, then she has 7 pages left to complete (9 - 2 = 7). If she also read 2 pages of her math homework, then she has 5 pages more math homework than reading homework (7 - 2 = 5)."
Response: 9 (wiskunde) - 2 (lees huiswerk) = 7 more pages of mathematics homework than biology homework.
Response: 4 more pages of biology homework than she had.
"Response: 
Rachel needs to complete 9 pages of mathematics homework (Wiskunde) and 11 pages of reading homework (Lees). To calculate how many pages she needs to complete in each subject, we can use the following formula:

Number of pages to complete = Total number of pages - Number of pages already completed

For Wiskunde:

Number of pages to complete = 9 - 11 = -2

For Lees:

Number of pages to complete = 11 - 9 = 2

Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 2 more pages of reading homework and 2 less pages of mathematics homework."
"Response: 
Rachel has to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and she has already read 7 pages. She also needs to finish 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 1 page of mathematics homework (8 - 7 = 1) and 3 pages of biology homework (3)."
"Response: 
Rachel has to complete 5 pages of mathematics homework (written as ""wiskunde"" in Afrikaans), which is equivalent to 30 minutes of work (based on an average time per page). She also needs to read 10 pages of material for her literature class (written as ""lees"" in Afrikaans) and complete 6 pages of biology homework.

To determine how long it will take Rachel to complete all her homework, we can calculate the total amount of time she needs to spend on each subject:

Mathematics (wiskunde): 5 pages x 30 minutes/page = 150 minutes
Literature (lees): 10 pages x 30 minutes/page = 300 minutes
Biology: 6 pages x 30 minutes/page = 180 minutes

Total time required: 150 + 300 + 180 = 630 minutes

Therefore, Rachel needs to spend approximately 630 minutes (or 10.5 hours) completing all her homework."

Response: 5 - 4 = 1 more email received in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response: 3 + x (where x is the number of e-mails received in the afternoon) = 10. Solving for x gives us that Jack received 7 e-mails in the afternoon.
"Response: 
Jack receives 3 emails and 64 letters every day. He received 5 emails and 54 letters today. To find out how many emails he receives per day, we need to subtract the number of emails he received today from the total number of emails he receives daily.

Total number of emails received daily = 3 + 5 = 8

Therefore, Jack receives 8 emails per day."

Dan had initially $5 and spent $2 on a chocolate stick, so he has $5 - $2 = $3 left."
Response:  The cost of the candy bar was $3. So, the child spent $3 + $4 = $7 on the candy bar and the chocolate stick.
"Response: 
There are 99 chocolates for $3, so each chocolate costs $3/99 = $0.031 per chocolate.
Dan paid $4, so he bought 4 x $0.031 = 12 chocolates."
"Response: 
Each chocolate costs $4/2 = $2."
"Response: 
Hy het 2 x $ 3 = $ 6 worth of chocolate bars."
"Response: 
There are three items that have been purchased for a total of $7. The breakdown of each item and its cost is as follows:

"Response: 
Hy het $ 2 gespandeer om 'n lekkergoed te koop, want dit was $ 6 minder as wat hy aan sjokolade gekoop het ($ 6 - $ 2 = $ 4)."
"Response: 
Hy het $ 5 gespandeer om 'n sjokoladestaaf te koop, want hy het 'n lekkergoed vir $ 2 en 'n sjokolade vir $ 3 gekoop. Dit beteken dat hy $ 1 meer gespandeer het as wat hy vir die sjokoladestaaf gepaid het."
"Response: 
There are several ways to approach this problem, but one way to do it is as follows:

Let X be the amount of money that Dan paid for the chocolate stick.
We know that X + 5 = 8 (because Dan paid $8 and his friend gave him $5).
So we can solve for X by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
X + 5 - 5 = 8 - 5
X = 3

Therefore, Dan paid $3 for the chocolate stick."
"Response: 
If Dan paid $3 for the chocolate stick after having $4 at the beginning, then he spent $1 ($3 - $4 = $1) on the snoepje."
"Response: 
There are 3 x $ 3 = $ 9 worth of chocolate in total."
"Response: 
Each chocolate costs $4/2 = $2."
"Response: 
Hy het $5 gespandeer om 'n lekkergoed te koop, want sy het 'n sjokolade vir $3 en 'n snoep vir $7 gekoop. Dit is $3 + $7 = $10. So hy het $5 gespandeer om 'n lekkergoed te koop as wat hy aan sjokolade gekoop het."

To find out how many more packagings than bottle caps Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the total number of packagings:
43 - 27 =?
So, Danny has 16 more packagings than bottle caps."
Response: 91 (66 + 25)
Response: 7 (25 - 28 = 7)
Response: 58
Response: 10 more bottle dopes did Danny find in the park than what he threw away.
Response: 6 more bottles did Danny throw away than what he found in the park.
"Response: 
Danny had initially 29 bottle dopes and 82 packagings. Therefore, he had 29 + 82 = 111 items in total."
Response: 66 (initially had)
Response: 39 more bottle caps than packaging has Danny found in the park. To calculate this, subtract the number of packagings (52) from the number of bottle caps (21), which gives us 39.
Response: 24 more packaging than bottle caps were found by Danny in the park.
"Response: 
Let's compare the number of bottle dopes and packaging that Danny has:

Number of bottle dopes = 12 (the number he currently has) + 58 (the number he found in the park) = 70

Number of packagings = 11 (the number he currently has) + 25 (the number he found in the park) = 36

Now we can see that Danny has more bottle dopes than packagings:

70 bottle dopes - 36 packagings = 34 more bottle dopes than packagings."
"Response: 
Let's compare the number of packaging and bottle caps that Danny has:

Number of packaging = 67 (given)
Number of bottle caps = 35 (given)

Now, let's find out how many more packaging than bottle caps Danny has:

Difference = Number of packaging - Number of bottle caps
= 67 - 35
= 32

So, Danny has 32 more packaging than bottle caps."
"Response: 
Steven has 11 fewer pigs than Jake. If Jake has 17 pigs, then Steven has 17 - 11 = 6 pigs."
"Response: 7 less than Jake's number of pigs is equal to 14 more than Jill's number of pigs minus 15. So we can set up an equation:
Jake's number of pigs = (14 - 15) + 7
= 9 + 7
= 16
Therefore, Jake has 16 pigs."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

Jake has 18 fewer people than Steven.
Steven has 19 people more than Jill.

We can write this as two equations:

Equation 1:
Jake has 18 fewer people than Steven:
J = S - 18... (1)

Equation 2:
Steven has 19 people more than Jill:
S = J + 19... (2)

Now we need to solve for Jill's number of people. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

S = J + 19
= (J - 18) + 19
= J + 19 + 18
= J + 37

So Jill has 37 people."
"Response: 
Jake has 3 fewer pigs than Steven, and Steven has 5 pigs. To find out how many more pigs Jake has than Jill, we need to subtract the number of pigs Jill has from the number of pigs Steven has.

Let's do that:

5 (Steven) - 3 (Jake) = 2

So Jake has 2 more pigs than Jill."
"Response: 
Jake has 12 fewer people than Steven, and Steven has 4 more people than Jill. To find out how many more people Jill has than Jake, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let J be the number of people Jake has.
Let S be the number of people Steven has.
Let Jl be the number of people Jill has.

From the problem statement, we know that:

S = J + 4 (since Steven has 4 more people than Jill)
J = 12 less than S (since Jake has 12 fewer people than Steven)

Substituting J = 12 less than S into the first equation, we get:

J = S - 12

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (J and Jl). Solving for Jl, we get:

Jl = S + 12

So Jill has 12 more people than Jake."
"Response: 
Jake has 7 fewer pigs than Steven and 9 more pigs than Jill. If Steven has 16 pigs, then Jake has 16 - 7 = 9 pigs."
"Response: 
Jake has 7 fewer pigs than Steven and 8 more pigs than Jill. If Steven has 17 pigs, then Jill has 17 + 8 = 25 pigs."
"Response: 
Steven has 16 people and Jill has x (less than 16) people. 
Jake has 9 fewer people than Steven, so Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 people. 
Since Jake has 7 people, Jill must have at least 7 + 1 = 8 people. 
Therefore, Jill has 8 people, which is 8 more than Steven."
"Response: 
Jake has 6 fewer pigs than Steven. Steven has 18 more pigs than Jill. So, if Jill has 5 pigs, then Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 pig."
"Response: 
Jake has 5 fewer pigs than Steven. Steven has 18 more pigs than Jill. To find out how many more pigs Jake has than Jill, we need to subtract the number of pigs Jill has from the number of pigs Steven has and then add the number of pigs Jake has.

Let's start by finding out how many pigs Jill has:

Steven has 18 more pigs than Jill, so if Jill has x pigs, Steven has x + 18 pigs.

We know that Jake has 5 fewer pigs than Steven, so Jake has (x + 18) - 5 pigs.

Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + 18) - 5 =?

To solve for x, we can first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

(x + 18) =? + 5

This gives us:

x + 18 =? + 5 + 18

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

x + 18 = 23

So, Jill has 23 pigs. Now we can find out how many more pigs Jake has than Jill:

Jake has 5 fewer pigs than Steven, so Jake has (23 - 5) = 18 more pigs than Jill.

Therefore, Jake has 18 more pigs than Jill."
"Response: 
Jake has 16 fewer people than Steven. Steven has 15 more people than Jill. To find out how many more people Jill has than Jake, we can subtract Jake's number from Steven's number and then subtract Jill's number from that result.

Steven has 15 more people than Jill, so:

15 = (Steven's number) - (Jill's number)

We know that Steven has 15 more people than Jill, so:

15 = (Steven's number) - (Jill's number)

Subtracting Jill's number from both sides gives us:

15 = (Steven's number) - (Jill's number) - (Jill's number)

Simplifying this equation gives us:

15 = (Steven's number) - 2(Jill's number)

Since Jill has 12 people, we can substitute that into the equation:

15 = (Steven's number) - 2(12)

Solving for Jill's number gives us:

15 = (Steven's number) - 24

Adding 24 to both sides of the equation gives us:

39 = Steven's number

Therefore, Jill has 39 + 12 = 51 more people than Jake."
"Response: 
Jake has 12 fewer people than Steven and 79 more apples. Let's start by writing an equation based on this information:

Let J have 19 - 12 = 7 people (since Steven has 19)

And let A be the number of apples Jake has:
A = 79 + 14 (since Steven has 14 apples)

Now we can solve for J using the first equation:

J = 19 - 12
J = 7

So Jake has 7 people."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven and 3 more apples.
Steven has 9 pears and 8 apples.

We can start by finding out how many pears Steven has:

9 pears

Now, we know that Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven, so Jake has:

9 - 13 =?

Subtracting 13 from 9 gives us:

6 pears

Next, we know that Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, so Jake has:

8 + 3 =?

Adding 3 to 8 gives us:

11 apples

Therefore, Jake has 6 pears and 11 apples."
"Response: 
Let's first find out how many fewer persimmons Jake has than Steven. We can do this by subtracting the number of persimmons Jake has from the number of persimmons Steven has:

17 (Steven) - 6 (Jake) = 11

So Jake has 11 fewer persimmons than Steven. Now let's find out how many more apples Steven has than Jake:

8 (Steven) - 0 (Jake) = 8

So Steven has 8 more apples than Jake. To find out how much more persimmons and apples Steven has in total, we can add the difference in persimmons to the difference in apples:

11 + 8 = 19

Therefore, Steven has 19 more persimmons and apples than Jake."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

Jake has 3 fewer people and 10 more apples than Steven.
Steven has 12 people and 15 apples.

We can let ""P"" represent the number of people and ""A"" represent the number of apples.

For Jake:
P = 12 - 3 = 9 (people)
A = 15 + 10 = 25 (apples)

For Steven:
P = 12 (people)
A = 15 (apples)

Now we can compare the number of apples Jake has to the number of people he has:

A/P = 25 / 9 = 2.78 (apples per person for Jake)

Similarly, we can compare the number of apples Steven has to the number of people he has:

A/P = 15 / 12 = 1.25 (apples per person for Steven)

So Jake has more apples per person than Steven does."
"Response: 
Jake has 4 fewer pigs than Steven, and Steven has 67 more pigs than Jill. Let's start by finding out how many pigs Steven has:
Steven has 12 + 67 = 79 pigs.
Now we can find out how many pigs Jill has:
Jill has 79 - 4 = 75 pigs.
Therefore, Jake has 4 pigs."
"Response: 
Jill has x perskets. 
Steven has 18 - 12 = 6 perskets more than Jill. 
So, we can set up an equation:
6 = x + 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
Therefore, Jill has 6 perskets."
"Response: 
Jake has 12 fewer than Steven and 72 more than Jill. To find out how many pets Jake has, we can start with what Steven has:
Steven has 19 pets.
Subtract 12 from 19 to find out how many pets Jake has:
19 - 12 =?
The result is:
19 - 12 = 7
So Jake has 7 pets."
"Response: 
Jill has 6 fewer pigs than Steven and 3 more pigs than Jake. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let S be the number of pigs Steven has:
S = 14... (1)

Let J be the number of pigs Jake has:
J = 6 less than S = 14 - 6 = 8... (2)

Let P be the number of pigs Jill has:
P = J + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11... (3)

Therefore, Jill has 11 pigs."
"Response: 
Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer pears. Steven has 13 pears and 52 apples. To find out how many pears Jake has, we can subtract the number of pears that Steven has from the total number of pears that Jake has. Let's do this:

Total number of pears Jake has = Number of apples Jake has + Number of pears Jake has
= 84 + (10 fewer)
= 84 + (-10)
= 74

Therefore, Jake has 74 pears."
"Response: 
Jake has 13 more apples than Steven and Steven has 8 persimmons and 12 apples. To find out how many apples Jake has, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say that Jake has x apples. Then, we know that Steven has 8 + x = 12 + x apples (since he has 8 persimmons and 12 apples). Solving for x gives us:
x = 20
So, Jake has 20 apples."
"Response: 
Let's first calculate how many apples and pears each person has:
Jake has 8 fewer pears than Steven, so Jake has 18 - 8 = 10 pears.
Steven has 11 apples and 18 pears, so he has a total of 11 + 18 = 29 fruits.
Now we can compare the number of apples to the number of pears for both people:
For Jake: Apples (10) / Pears (10) = 1
For Steven: Apples (11) / Pears (18) = 0.61 (or 61%) more pears than apples.
Therefore, Steven has 61% more pears than apples, while Jake has only one apple for every ten pears."
"Response: 
Steven has 19 apples and 15 pecks, which means he has 19 x 2 = 38 apples in total.
Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven, so Jake has 38 - 3 = 35 apples.
Jake also has 4 more pecks than Steven, so Jake has 4 + 15 = 19 pecks.
Therefore, for every apple that Jake has, Steven has 1.67 pecks (19 / 35)."

"Response: 
To calculate how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she had before going shopping (100 dollars) from the total amount of money she had after shopping (159 dollars). This gives us:

159 - 100 = 59 dollars

So Olivia spent 59 dollars at the supermarket."
"Response: 
To calculate how much more money Olivia collected at the OTM than what she spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent at the supermarket from the total amount of money she had in her purse.

Total amount of money = $3 + $49 = $52
Amount spent at supermarket = $49

Subtracting the amount spent at the supermarket from the total amount of money gives us:

$52 - $49 = $3

Therefore, Olivia collected $3 more at the OTM than what she spent at the supermarket."
"Response: 
To find out how much more money Olivia spent at the supermarket than what she collected from her OTM, we need to subtract the amount she collected from the OTM ($91) from the amount of money she had left after shopping at the supermarket ($14).

$14 - $91 = $-77

So, Olivia spent $77 more at the supermarket than what she collected from her OTM."
"Response: 
Let x be the amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket. Then we know that she had $106 - x dollars left after visiting both places. At the supermarket, she spent $49. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

$106 - x = $26

Subtracting $x from both sides gives us:

$106 = $26 + $x

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = $80

Therefore, Olivia spent $80 at the supermarket."
"Response: 
If there were $54 in her purse initially and she spent $29 at the supermarket, then she has $54 - $29 = $25 left in her purse."
"Response: 
If Olivia had $128 in her purse and she spent $38 at the supermarket, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90)."

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Dave had 21 programs on his phone before he added 89 new ones.
* After removing a few, he had 24 programs left.

To find out how many more programs Dave added than the ones he removed, we need to subtract the number of programs he removed from the total number of programs he had after adding the new ones:

21 (initial programs) + 89 (new programs) = 110

Subtracting the number of programs Dave removed (24):

110 - 24 = 86

So, Dave added 86 more programs than the ones he removed."
Response: 71 - 14 = 57.
Response: 16 - 5 = 11 apps were removed by Dave.
Response: 14 (17 - 3 = 14).
"Response: 
To calculate how many more apps (lêers) Dave has on his phone after he removed a few programs and lessons, we need to subtract the number of programs and lessons he had before removing them from the total number of programs and lessons he has now.

Let's do that:

Total number of programs and lessons now = 21 programs + 4 lessons = 25

Number of programs and lessons before removal = 15 programs + 24 lessons = 39

Subtracting the two numbers gives us:

25 - 39 = -14

So, Dave has 14 fewer apps (lessons) on his phone now than he did before removing a few programs and lessons."
Response: 15 - 6 = 9 more learners than programs on the phone.
Response: 18 - 17 = 1 app was added to the phone.
"Response: 
Dave had 59 lessons and 15 programs on his phone. After removing a few programs and lessons, he was left with 12 programs and 30 lessons. Therefore, Dave removed 47 items (59 - 12 = 47) from his phone."
"Response: 
To find out how many lessons Dave has removed, we need to subtract the number of lessons he had after removing some programs from the number of lessons he had before removing any programs.
Let's do that:
24 (initial number of lessons) - 17 (number of lessons after removing some programs) = 7
So, Dave has removed 7 lessons."
Response: 5 (number of lees) - 24 (total number of apps) = 19 more apps than lessons on his phone.
"Response: 
Let's compare the number of lessons (L) to the number of programs (P):

L = 24 (given)
P = 2 (given)

To find out how many more lessons than programs there are, we can subtract P from L:

L - P = 24 - 2 = 22

So, there are 22 more lessons than programs on Dave's phone."

"Response:  To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than 10 cards, we need to subtract the number of 10 cards she had from the total number of baseball cards she had. Let's do that:

178 - 10 =?

The difference is:

178 - 10 = 168

So, Nell has 168 more baseball cards than 10 cards."
"Response:  To find out how many more 10-card than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has from the total number of cards she had before giving some to Jeff. 
Let X be the number of 10-cards Nell had before giving any to Jeff. 
X + 38 = 239 (since she had 38 10-cards)

Now, let Y be the number of baseball cards she had before giving any to Jeff. 
Y + 111 = 239 (since she had 111 baseball cards)

We know that X + Y = 239 (total number of cards she had before giving any to Jeff)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

X + 38 - Y - 111 = 239 - Y - 111

Simplifying, we get:

2X + 27 = 128

Solving for X, we get:

X = 64

So, Nell had 64 10-card and 165 baseball cards before giving any to Jeff.

To find out how many more 10-card than baseball cards she has now, we subtract the number of baseball cards she has from the number of cards she had before giving any to Jeff:

"Response: 
Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. If he buys 3 more cookies, how many more cookies has he eaten than what he bought?

Let's break down the information we have:

1. Paco had 25 cookies to start with (initial amount).
2. He ate 5 cookies (subtract this from the initial amount):

25 - 5 = 20

So, Paco had 20 cookies left after eating 5 cookies.
3. Now, let's find out how many more cookies he has eaten than what he bought:

He bought 3 cookies (given in the problem), so:

20 - 3 = 17

Therefore, Paco has eaten 17 more cookies than what he bought."
"Response: 
Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. He bought more than he ate, so we can say that he bought x cookies, where x is greater than 2 (the number of cookies he ate). Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco had and the number of cookies he ate is equal to the number of cookies he bought:

11 - 2 = x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, Paco bought 9 more cookies than he ate."

To find out how much more milk (in liters) Baker sold than bread, we need to subtract the amount of bread he sold from the amount of milk he sold.
Let's do that:
158 - 147 = 11
So, Baker sold 11 more liters of milk than bread."
"Response: 
To find out how much more bread was sold than cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made and then divide by the number of cakes sold. This will give us the ratio of bread to cakes sold.

Total number of cakes made = 54 + 143 = 207
Number of cakes sold = 68

Ratio of bread to cakes sold = (207 - 68) / 68
= (139) / 68
= 2.04

So for every one cake that was sold, there were approximately 2.04 loaves of bread sold."

"Response: 
To calculate how many bags of apples they will have after 49 days of eating 38 sacks per day with 42 lemons per sack, we need to use multiplication and division.

Number of sacks per day: 38
Number of lemons per sack: 42
Total number of lemons consumed per day: 38 x 42 = 1676

Duration (in days): 49

Therefore, the total number of lemons consumed in 49 days is:
1676 x 49 = 80,524

Now, let's convert this number to bags of apples:

One bag contains: 42 lemons

So, the number of bags of apples required to consume 80,524 lemons is:
80,524 / 42 = 1912

Therefore, after 49 days of eating 38 sacks per day with 42 lemons per sack, they will have approximately 1912 bags of apples left."
"Response: 
To calculate how many lemons will be produced after 87 days of squeezing, we need to know how many lemons are in each sack and how many sacks are produced per day. We are given that there are 25 lemons in each sack and 66 sacks per day. Therefore, the number of lemons produced per day is:

66 sacks x 25 lemons/sack = 1650 lemons/day

Since there are 87 days, the total number of lemons produced would be:

1650 lemons/day x 87 days = 143,500 lemons

Therefore, after 87 days of squeezing, they will have produced approximately 143,500 lemons."
"Response: 
Hulle oes 8 x 35 = 280 lemoene per dag."
"Response: 
To determine how many days it will take to produce 80 bags of lemons, we need to divide the total number of lemons by the number of lemons in each bag. We can do this using division.

Total number of lemons = 80 x 57 = 4560 lemons

Number of lemons in each bag = 57

Therefore, we can calculate the number of bags as follows:

Number of bags = Total number of lemons / Number of lemons in each bag
= 4560 / 57
= 80 bags

So, it will take 80 days to produce 80 bags of lemons, assuming that each day they produce 16 bags and each bag contains 57 lemons."
"Response: 
To calculate how many apples are eaten in total when they eat 35 baskets of apples, we need to first find out how many apples are in each basket. We know that there are 12 lemons in each sack and 67 sacks per day, so there are:

67 x 12 = 804 lemons per day

Since each lemon contains 4 apples, there are:

804 x 4 = 3216 apples per day

Therefore, if they eat 35 baskets of apples, they will eat:

35 x 12 = 420 lemons

420 x 4 = 1680 apples"
"Response: 
If they throw away 71 sacks of apples per day and keep 3 sacks, then they will have 71 x 51 = 3611 sacks of apples after 51 days."
"Response: 
To calculate how many lemons are wasted per day, we need to know that there are 76 sacks of lemons and 64 of them are thrown away. We also know that each sack contains 50 lemons. Therefore, the number of lemons wasted per day is:

76 sacks x 64 sacks/day = 4896 lemons/day

So, approximately 4896 lemons are wasted per day."
"Response: 
If they produce 28 sacks of ripe lemons and 52 sacks of unripe lemons per day, then after 26 days, they will have produced a total of:

28 x 26 = 728 sacks of ripe lemons
52 x 26 = 1320 sacks of unripe lemons

Therefore, in total, they will have produced 728 + 1320 = 2048 sacks of lemons."
"Response: 
If they produce 82 sacks of ripe lemons and 61 sacks of unripe lemons per day, then after 25 days, they will have produced a total of:

82 x 25 = 2050 sacks of ripe lemons
61 x 25 = 1525 sacks of unripe lemons

Therefore, in 25 days, they will have a total of 3575 sacks (2050 + 1525) of lemons."
"Response: 
If they have 31 sacks of ripe lemons and 24 sacks of unripe lemons per day, and they will have 45 days of production, then they will have:

31 x 45 = 1435 sacks of ripe lemons
24 x 45 = 1080 sacks of unripe lemons

Therefore, after 45 days of production, they will have a total of 1435 + 1080 = 2515 sacks of lemons."
Response: 19 more sacks of ripe lemons are produced per day than unripe lemons (44 - 25 = 19).
"Response: 
To calculate how many more sacks of unripe lemons are produced per day than ripe lemons, we need to subtract the number of sacks of ripe lemons from the total number of sacks of lemons produced per day.

Total number of sacks of lemons produced per day = 5 sacks of ripe lemons + 74 sacks of unripe lemons

Number of sacks of ripe lemons per day = 5 sacks

Therefore, the difference between the number of sacks of ripe and unripe lemons is:

74 sacks - 5 sacks = 69 sacks

So, there are 69 more sacks of unripe lemons produced per day than ripe lemons."
"Response: 
To calculate how many days it would take to eat 54 sacks of lemons if they eat 18 sacks per day, we can use division.

54 (sacks) / 18 (sacks/day) = x (days)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 54 / 18

x = 3 days

Therefore, it would take 3 days to eat 54 sacks of lemons if they eat 18 sacks per day."

65 x 6 = 390 unripe lemons
46 x 6 = 276 ripe lemons

Therefore, they will have a total of 390 + 276 = 666 lemons after 6 days of production."
Response: 86 - 41 = 45 more sacks of ripe lemons are produced per day than unripened lemons.
"Response: 
To calculate how many more sacks of unripe lemons are produced than ripe lemons per day, we need to subtract the number of sacks of ripe lemons from the total number of sacks of lemons produced per day.

Total number of sacks of lemons produced per day = 71 + 60 = 131 sacks

Number of sacks of ripe lemons produced per day = 60 sacks

Therefore, the difference between the number of sacks of unripe and ripe lemons produced per day is:

131 - 60 = 71 sacks

So, there are 71 more sacks of unripe lemons produced per day than ripe lemons."

"Response:  To determine how much more carpeting Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we need to find out how many square feet of carpeting she has already laid down and then subtract that amount from the total area of the room. 
Let's start by finding out how many square feet of carpeting Jesse has already laid down:
11 feet x 15 feet = 165 square feet (area of the section of floor that Jesse has already covered)
Now, let's calculate the total area of the room:
11 feet x 20 feet = 220 square feet (total area of the room)
Subtracting the area that Jesse has already covered from the total area gives us the amount of carpeting needed for the rest of the room:
220 square feet - 165 square feet = 55 square feet
Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 55 square feet of carpeting to cover the entire floor."
"Response:  To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of each tile. Since each tile is 4 square feet and the room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, the total area of the room is:

Area = length x width = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet

Therefore, we need:

Number of tiles = Total area / Area per tile
= 24 / 4
= 6 tiles

So, six tiles would be needed to cover the entire floor."
"Response:  To calculate the total area of all 20 rooms, we need to multiply the length and width of each room. Since each room has a length of 19 feet and a width of 18 feet, the total area of one room would be:

So, they sold 10 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response: 
To find out the cost of each T-shirt, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold.

Total Revenue = $51 dollars
Number of T-shirts sold = 3

Cost per T-shirt = Total Revenue / Number of T-shirts sold
= $51 / 3
= $17

Therefore, the cost of each T-shirt is $17."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech games, we need to know the number of T-shirts sold during each game. The problem states that they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game. Therefore, to find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we can use the information given in the problem:

Number of T-shirts sold during Arkansas game = 47
Price per T-shirt = $87

To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we can multiply the number of T-shirts sold by the price per T-shirt:

Money made from selling T-shirts during Arkansas game = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt
= 47 x $87
= $3,969

Since they also sold 95 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we can use the same formula to find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game:

Money made from selling T-shirts during Texas Tech game = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt
= 95 x $87
= $8,295

Therefore, the total amount of money they made from selling T-shirts during both games is:

Total amount of money made from selling T-shirts = Money made from selling T-shirts during Arkansas game + Money made from selling T-shirts during Texas Tech game
= $3,969 + $8,295
= $12,264"

To find out how many T-shirts Razorback would sell during the Texas Tech game if they sold 115 during the Arkansas game, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:

Let X be the number of T-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.

We know that the price per T-shirt is $106 and that Razorback sold 242 T-shirts during both games combined:

242 = 106X + Y

where Y is the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game (we already know this to be 115).

Solving for X, we get:

X = 242 / 106

X = 23

Therefore, Razorback would sell 23 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money they made selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to know how many T-shirts they sold and at what price. Let's use the information given in the problem:

* They sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game.
* The cost of each T-shirt is $98.

"Response: 
To find out how much money the Razorbacks made from selling truis, we need to multiply the number of truis they sold (156) by the price per trui ($165).

156 truis x $165 per trui = $25,890

So, the Razorbacks made $25,890 from selling truis during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response: 
To find out how much more the T-shirts cost than the truis, we need to subtract the price of the truis from the price of the T-shirts.

$192 (T-shirts) - $34 (truis) = $158

So, the T-shirts cost $158 more than the truis."
"Response: 
To find out how much more the truis cost than the T-shirts, we need to subtract the revenue from the T-shirts from the revenue from the truis.
Revenue from T-shirts = 254 x $86 = $21,704
Revenue from truis = 43 x $232 = $9,764

To calculate how much money they made by selling the t-shirts, we need to know the number of t-shirts sold and the price at which they were sold. Let's use the information given in the problem:

* The Razorback T-hemp winkel sold each t-shirt for $51.
* During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they had an 8% discount on all t-shirts.
* They sold 130 t-shirts during the game.

First, let's find out how much they would have made if they didn't offer any discounts:

130 t-shirts x $51/t-shirt = $6,430

Now, let's subtract the amount they would have made without the discount:

$6,430 - $6,430 x 8% (discount) = $6,430 x 8% = $512.40

So, they made a total of $512.40 from selling the t-shirts during the game, after offering an 8% discount."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money they made by selling the t-shirts, we need to know the number of t-shirts sold and the price at which they were sold. Let's use the information given in the problem:

Total revenue from T-Shirts = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt
= 177 x $240
= $42,880

Now, let's find out how much more the T-Shirts cost than the Jerseys:

Difference in Revenue = Total Revenue from T-Shirts - Total Revenue from Jerseys
= $42,880 - $4,630
= $38,250

So, the T-Shirts cost $38,250 more than the Jerseys."
"Response: 
To find out how much more the truis cost than the T-shirts, we need to subtract the revenue from the T-shirts from the revenue from the truis.
Revenue from T-shirts = 115 x 113 = $12,945

Therefore, Lewis will have $3890 at the end of the season."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 seasons, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in each season. Since there are 223 weeks in each season, multiplying $1357 by 223 gives us:

$1357 x 223 = $306,941

Therefore, Lewis will earn $306,941 if he works for 73 seasons."
"Response: 
To calculate how much Lewis will earn during the season, we need to multiply his weekly earnings from both jobs.
Weekly earnings from part-time job = $939
Weekly earnings from full-time job = $28 x 4 weeks/week = $112
Total weekly earnings = $939 + $112 = $1051

Since there are 1091 weeks in the season, we can calculate the total amount Lewis will earn as follows:
Total amount earned = Total weekly earnings x Number of weeks in the season
= $1051 x 1091
= $1,136,711"

= 612 / 6
= 102

Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day."
"Response: 
There are 555 pages in the book, divided into 5 chapters. If it took Frank 220 days to read the book, then he must have spent approximately 44.8 days (220/5) reading each chapter. Therefore, there are approximately 44.8 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 
To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book. We can do this using the following calculation:

Number of chapters = Total pages / Number of days
= 193 pages / 660 days
= 0.297 chapters/day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.297 (or about 3) chapters per day."
"Response: 
To calculate how many pages Frank reads per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it takes him to read each book. We can do this using the following calculation:

Total pages / Number of days = Pages per day

In this case, the total number of pages is 249 (since each book has 249 pages), and the number of days it takes Frank to read each book is 3 (since he spends 3 days reading each book). So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank reads per day as follows:

249 / 3 = 83 pages per day

Therefore, Frank reads 83 pages per day."
Response: 80 books (492 days / 66 pages per book = 80 books)
"Response: 
To find out how many pages Frank read each day, we need to divide the number of pages in the book (112) by the number of days it took him to finish reading it (16).

112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages per day"
Response: 576 pages / 8 pages per day = 72 days
"Response: 
To calculate how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book. We can do this using the following calculation:

Total pages = 41 x 450 = 18,950 pages
Days taken = 30

Now, let's divide the total pages by the number of days:

Pages per day = Total pages / Days taken
= 18,950 / 30
= 631.67 pages per day

So, Frank read approximately 631.67 pages per day."
"Response: 
There are 594 pages in each chapter of the book that Frank read, and there were three chapters in total. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter can be calculated as follows:

594 pages per chapter x 3 chapters = 1782 pages

So, there are 1782 pages in the entire book."
"Response: 
To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the number of pages in each chapter by the total number of days it took him to finish the book. We can do this using the following calculation:

Number of chapters per day = (Total number of pages in the book) / (Total number of days it took to finish the book)

In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 810 (2 x 405), and Frank finished the book in 664 days. So, we can calculate the number of chapters per day as follows:

Number of chapters per day = (810) / (664) = 1.23 chapters per day

Therefore, Frank read approximately 1.23 chapters per day."

Response: 22 more visitors visited Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day.
"Response: 
There were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day and there were 246 visitors that day. To find out how many visitors the palace had received within 25 days, we can use the formula for finding the total of a series:

Total = (first term x number of terms) + (second term x number of terms)

In this case, the first term is 246 (the number of visitors on the current day), and the second term is 703 (the number of visitors the previous day). The number of terms is 25 (the number of days).

So, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 25 days is:

Total = (246 x 25) + (703 x 25)
= 6150 + 17575
= 23725

Therefore, the palace had received 23725 visitors within 25 days."
"Response: 340 (calculation below)

Question: How many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day if there were 666 visitors on that day and 100 visitors the previous day?

Calculation:

Let x be the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the previous day.
We know that 100 visitors visited the palace on the previous day.

So, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 340 = 666... (1)

where 340 is the difference between the total number of visitors on the current day (666) and the number of visitors on the previous day (x).

Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we can subtract 340 from both sides of equation (1):

x + 340 - 340 = 666 - 340

This simplifies to:

2x = 326

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 163

Therefore, there were 163 visitors at Buckingham Palace the previous day."
Response:  There were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day, and 406 people have visited the palace in the past 327 days. To find out how many visitors the palace had the previous day, we can divide 406 by 327 to get an average number of daily visitors, which is approximately 1.25. Therefore, there were about 1.25 x 132 = 160 visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day.
Response: 45 + 829 = 874 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day.
Response:  To find out how many visitors the Buckingham Palace had within 57 days, we need to divide the total number of visitors (557) by the number of visitors per day (188). Therefore, the Buckingham Palace had 557 / 188 = 3 visitors per day within 57 days.
Response: 661 - 600 = 61 more visitors to Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day.
"Response: 
To find out how many visitors Buckingham Palace had that day, we need to subtract the number of visitors who went there the previous day (419) and the number of visitors who went there the day before that (103), from the total number of visitors for that day (92).

"Response: 
To calculate how many bags of cement will be filled in 146 days, we need to know how many bags are filled per day and how many days there are in 146 days.

Let's start by converting the number of bags filled per day from vates (a unit of measurement used for dry goods) to bags:

244 vates = 244 / 50 = 4.88 bags/day (since 50 bags is equal to 1 vate)
47 vates = 47 / 50 = 0.94 bags/day

Now, let's calculate the total number of bags that will be filled in 146 days:

Total number of bags = 4.88 bags/day x 146 days = 693.76 bags
+ 0.94 bags/day x 146 days = 136.24 bags

Therefore, in 146 days, 829.96 bags of cement will be filled."
"Response: 
To calculate how many baskets of strawberries and raspberries will be filled in 77 days, we need to know the number of pluckers and their daily production. Let's break down the information given:

* 235 pluckers said they can fill 100 baskets of strawberries per day (on average)
* 221 pluckers said they can fill 221 baskets of raspberries per day (on average)

Now, let's assume that all 235 pluckers work every day for 77 days (which is not mentioned in the problem statement but seems reasonable). We can calculate the total number of baskets of each fruit that will be filled in 77 days as follows:

Strawberries:
235 pluckers x 100 baskets/day = 23,500 baskets/day
Total strawberries filled in 77 days = 23,500 baskets/day x 77 days = 1,846,500 baskets

Raspberries:
221 pluckers x 221 baskets/day = 49,611 baskets/day
Total raspberries filled in 77 days = 49,611 baskets/day x 77 days = 3,755,577 baskets

Therefore, in 77 days, approximately 1,846,500 baskets of strawberries and 3,755,577 baskets of raspberries will be filled by the pluckers."

"Response:  To determine how many pieces of scrap metal Posman must give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of houses in each block. There are 12 houses in each block, so we can calculate as follows:  
Total number of pieces = 4 x 81 = 324 pieces  
Number of houses per block = 12  
Therefore, Posman must give 324/12 = 27 pieces of scrap metal to each block."
"Response:  To calculate the total number of pieces of scrap metal that Postman must give away, we need to multiply the number of houses in each block by the number of blocks. Since there are 17 houses in each block and 16 blocks in total, the total number of houses is:

17 x 16 = 272 houses

Since Postman must give away 4 pieces of scrap metal to each house, the total number of pieces of scrap metal he must give away is:

272 x 4 = 1088 pieces

Therefore, Postman must give away 1088 pieces of scrap metal in total."

The difference is 1. So, Jackie has one more apple than Adam."
Response: 2 more apples does Jackie have than Adam.
"Response: 
Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together. If they have 4 more than what Adam and Jackie have together, then we can let x be the number of apples that Adam and Jackie have together.

x + 4 = 6... (1)

We know that x is the number of apples that Adam and Jackie have together, so we can substitute x for 4 in equation (1):

x + 4 = 6

Substituting x for 4 gives us:

4 + 4 = 6

Which simplifies to:

8 = 6

Therefore, Adam and Jackie have 8 apples altogether."
Response: 2 apples.
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Adam and Jackie have 12 apples together.
* Adam has 9 more apples than Jackie.

We can let A represent the number of apples that Adam has and J represent the number of apples that Jackie has. Since they have 12 apples together, we know that:

A + J = 12...3)

Now, we are told that Adam has 9 more apples than Jackie, so we can write:

A - J = 9...4)

Substituting equation 4 into equation 3, we get:

A + J = 12
A - J = 9

Solving for A, we get:

A = 12 + J
A = 12 + (J - 9)
A = 12 + J - 9

Therefore, Adam has 12 + J - 9 apples.

So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has 12 + x - 9 apples."
"Response: 
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie.
* Jackie has 10 apples.
* Adam and Jackie together have 2 apples.

We can let A represent the number of apples Adam has, and J represent the number of apples Jackie has. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, we know that A = J + 4.

Also, since Adam and Jackie together have 2 apples, we know that A + J = 2.

Now we can solve for A using the first equation:
A = J + 4
Substituting J = 10 from the second equation:
A = 10 + 4
A = 14

So Adam has 14 apples."

"Response: 
To calculate how much money Jason made by washing cars, we need to subtract the amount he spent on gas from the amount he earned.
Jason earned $19 last week and spent $33 on gas this week, so:
$19 - $33 = $-14
Jason lost $14 by washing cars."
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and spent $9 on motors this week, so he has $77 left ($86 - $9).
Jason had $5 last week and did not work this week, so he still has $5.
Together, they have $77 + $5 = $82."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money Fred earned over the past week, we need to subtract his previous earnings from his current earnings:
Fred's current earnings = $40
Fred's previous earnings = $19

Subtracting his previous earnings from his current earnings gives us:
$40 - $19 = $21

Therefore, Fred earned $21 over the past week."
"Response:  To find out how much money Jason made that week, we need to subtract the amount of money he had last week from the amount of money he has this week. Let's do that:

Jason had $22 last week and he spent $21 on motorcycles, so he has $22 - $21 = $1 left.

Therefore, Jason made $1 that week."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money Fred and Jason earned by washing cars, we need to subtract their initial amount of money from their new amounts of money.

To calculate how much money Fred and Jason earned by delivering newspapers, we need to subtract their expenses from their income.
Fred's income was $49 + $112 = $161
Jason's income was $3 + $63 = $66

Subtracting their expenses:
Fred: $161 - $49 = $112
Jason: $66 - $3 = $63

Therefore, Fred earned $112 and Jason earned $63 by delivering newspapers."
"Response: 
To calculate how much money they earned by delivering newspapers, we need to add the amount of money that Fred and Jason made.
Fred made $90 - $78 = $12 more than last week.

Fred had $47 + $111 = $158 last week and this week he spent $34, so now he has $158 - $34 = $124."
Response: 51 kg (Jessie weighed 71 kg initially and lost 20 kg, so her current weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kg)
"Response: 
Jessie lost 101 kg after starting to run every day. If she weighed 27 kg before starting to run, then she must have weighed 128 kg (27 + 101) before losing weight."
"Response: 
Jessie weighed 126 kg before she started running every day and lost 60 kg. Therefore, she weighed 66 kg now. To find out how much she weighed before starting to run, we can subtract 60 kg from her current weight of 66 kg:

66 kg - 60 kg = 6 kg

So, Jessie weighed 6 kg more before starting to run than she does now."
"Response: 
Jessie lost 35 kg or 77 lbs. Therefore, she now weighs 69 - 35 = 34 kg or 75 lbs."
"Response: 
Jessie weighs 54 kg now (50 kg less from first week + 60 kg less from second week)."
"Response: 
Jessie weighed 9 kg before she started running. She lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week. Therefore, she weighed 9 - 62 = 3 kg after the first week and 9 - 140 = 5 kg after the second week."

"Response: 
To calculate how many wooden planks John needs for the house wall, we need to know the number of nails required per plank and the total length of the wall. Let's assume that each plank is 2 meters long and requires 4 nails. The total length of the wall is given as 10 meters. Therefore, the number of planks needed can be calculated as follows:

Number of planks = Total length of wall / Length of one plank
= 10 meters / 2 meters
= 5 planks

So, John will need 5 wooden planks for the house wall, assuming he uses 4 nails per plank."
Response: 25 spykers (13 x 17 = 221 + 8)
"Response: 
To calculate how many planks John needs for the house wall, we need to determine how much wood he has available and how long each plank needs to be. Let's assume that each plank requires 3 nails (spykers) to secure it in place, and there are 8 nails left over after securing all of the planks.

We can start by dividing the total number of nails available (8) by the number of nails needed per plank (3):

8 nails / 3 nails per plank = 2 planks

So, John has enough nails to secure 2 planks. Since each plank needs to be 3 times as long as the distance between two nails, we can calculate the length of one plank as follows:

Distance between two nails = 3 x Length of one plank

We know that there are 8 nails in total, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

8 nails x 3 = 24

Now we have our first equation:

3L + 3 = 24

Simplifying the equation:

3L = 21

Solving for L (the length of one plank):

L = 7

Since each plank needs to be 3 times as long as the distance between two nails, we can triple the length of one plank to get the total length of all the planks needed for the house wall:

Total length of planks = 3 x L = 3 x 7 = 21

Therefore, John needs 21 planks of wood to build the house wall."
"Response: 
John needs 15 (groot) + 5 (klein) = 20 spykers for the house wall."
Response: 32 spykers (2 x 16)
"Response: 
To calculate how many wooden planks John will need for the house wall, we can use the following formula:

Number of planks = Total length of wall / Length of each plank

We know that the total length of the wall is 80 feet (24 meters), and each plank is 74 inches long (193 cm). So, to find out how many planks John will need, we can divide the total length of the wall by the length of each plank:

Number of planks = 80 ft / 74 in
= 109.5 planks

Therefore, John will need approximately 110 wooden planks to build the house wall."
"Response: 
To determine how many planks John needs for the house wall, we need to calculate the total number of spikes required for all the planks. Let's start by calculating the number of spikes needed for each plank:

For great planks (12 x 14 = 168 spikes)
For small planks (17 x 25 = 425 spikes)
Total number of spikes = 168 + 425 = 693 spikes

Now, let's divide the total number of spikes by the number of spikes per plank to find out how many planks are needed:

693 spikes / 14 spikes/plank (great planks) = 49 planks
693 spikes / 25 spikes/plank (small planks) = 27 planks

Therefore, John will need a total of 49 + 27 = 76 planks for the house wall."

Response: 23 x 43 = 961 + 8 = 969 stukkies kougom het Robin.
"Response: 
To find out how many packets Robin has, we need to divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each packet. We know that there are 7 pieces in each packet and Robin has 6 extra pieces, so we can calculate as follows:

Total number of pieces of gum = 41 (given)
Number of pieces in each packet = 7

Therefore, number of packets = Total number of pieces of gum / Number of pieces in each packet
= 41 / 7
= 6

So Robin has 6 packets of gum."
Response: 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of kougom.

So, the ring toss game should aim to make approximately 14 dollars per day."
"Response: 
To calculate the total amount earned by the carnival over the entire period of 54 days, we need to add the amounts earned during the first 44 days and the remaining 10 days.

First 44 days: 382 dollars x 44 days = 16,968 dollars
Remaining 10 days: 374 dollars x 10 days = 3,740 dollars
Total amount earned: 16,968 + 3,740 = 20,708 dollars"
"Response:
