"Response:  On Monday, Julia was playing with 18 children. On Wednesday, she was playing with 10 children. So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is:

18 - 10 = 8

Therefore, Julia had 8 more children to play with on Monday than on Wednesday."
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 11 children in her class. On Wednesday, she had 12 children in her class, which is more than the number of children she had on Monday. So, the difference between the number of children Julia had on Wednesday and Monday is 1 (12 - 11 = 1). Therefore, the answer to the question is 1.
Response:  If Julia had played with 5 children on Monday and then with other 10 children on Wednesday, if she had played with all of them together, how many children would she have played with in total? So, the answer is 15 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia was playing with 5 children. On Wednesday, she played with 14 more children, so in total, she played with 19 children. If she had played with all 16 children together, then on Monday, she would have played with how many children?  Solution:  To find out how many children Julia played with on Monday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the total number of children she played with. So, if Julia played with 16 children altogether and played with 5 children on Monday, then she played with 11 children on Monday (16 - 5 = 11).
Response:  On Monday, Julia was playing with 16 children. On Tuesday, she played with more than 12 children but fewer than 16. So, the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday is between 12 and 16, inclusive. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 14 children with her.  On Tuesday, she had more than 8 children with her. So, the number of children Julia had on Tuesday is greater than or equal to 8. Therefore, the answer is (8) or higher.
Response:  On Monday, Julie played with 17 children. On Wednesday, she played with 2 children. Therefore, in total, Julie played with 19 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 15 children. On Wednesday, she played with 97 children. So, in total, Julia played with 112 children (15 + 97).
Response:  Monday and Thursday have 5 and 9 people respectively, so together they are 14 people. And on Wednesday and Friday there are 15 people. So in total, Julie has played with 38 people (14 + 15).
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 2 children with her. On Wednesday, she had 16 children with her. So, in total, Julia had 18 children with her (2 + 16 = 18). Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 9 children playing with her. On Tuesday, she had 7 children playing with her. And on Thursday, she had 96 children playing with her. So, if we compare Monday to Tuesday, there are 2 more children playing with Julia on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 14 children. On Wednesday, she had 8 children. So, in total, Julia had 22 children. Now, let's compare the number of children Julia had on Wednesday to the number of children she had on Monday. On Wednesday, Julia had 8 children, and on Monday, she had 14 children. Therefore, Julia had 6 more children on Monday than she did on Wednesday. The difference between the two numbers is 6.
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 8 children playing with her. On Wednesday, she had 9 children playing with her. So, in total, Julia had 8 + 9 = 17 children playing with her.
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 15 children playing with her. On Wednesday, she had 7 children playing with her. So, in total, Julia had 22 children playing with her (15 + 7). Now, let's compare this number to the number of children who played with her on Thursday - 18. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who played with Julia on Monday and Thursday is 4 (22 - 18).
Response:  On Monday, Julie played with 13 children. On Wednesday, she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julie played with 28 children.
Response:  On Monday, Juliana played with 7 children. On Tuesday, she played with 13 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 20 children. So, in total, Juliana played with __________ children. (Note: The blank space represents the number of children Juliana played with.)
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 12 children in her class and taught for 34 hours. On Wednesday, she had 14 children in her class and taught for another 34 hours. Therefore, Julia taught a total of 27 children (12 + 14) over two days.
Response:  On Monday, Julia had 19 children in her care and tagged them for 38 hours. On Wednesday, she had 18 children and tagged them for 38 hours again. So, if we subtract the number of children she had on Wednesday from the total number of hours she spent tagging on both days, we get: 38 - 18 = 20 hours. Therefore, Julia spent an additional 20 hours tagging children on Monday compared to Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia was taking care of 5 children.  On Tuesday, she was taking care of 6 children, which is more than the number of children she took care of on Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia took care of on Monday and Tuesday is 1 child. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 4 children. On Wednesday, she played with more than 4 children. So, the number of children Julia played with on Wednesday is greater than 4. Therefore, the answer is (5 or more).
Response:  On Monday, Julie was playing with 4 children. On Tuesday, she played with 6 more children than on Monday. So, the number of children she played with on Tuesday is: 4 + (6 - 4) = 10 children.  Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Bob ate 25 sweets after eating 10 sweets initially, then he ate a total of 35 sweets (10 + 25). So, from the start, Bob ate 35 sweets.
Response:  If Bob has eaten 28 pieces of candy and wants to eat 42 more, then he will have eaten in total 70 pieces of candy (28 + 42 = 70).  However, if he also ate 63 chocolates, then he has eaten a total of 133 candies (70 + 63 = 133). Therefore, Bob has eaten 133 candies in total.
Response:  If Bobbi ate 33 pieces of candy and then ate 4 more after that, he ate in total 37 pieces of candy (33 + 4).  Additionally, if he ate 14 chocolate bars, he ate in total 51 pieces of candy and chocolate (37 + 14). Therefore, Bobbi ate a total of 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.
Response:  First, Bob ate 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces of candy. So, in total, Bob ate 74 pieces of candy (38 + 36). Now, let's compare this to how many chocolates Bob ate. According to the question, Bob ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, we can conclude that Bob ate more candies than chocolates. In particular, Bob ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolates (74 - 16 = 58).
Response:  If Bob ate 20 pieces of candy and then ate 34 more pieces of candy after that, he would have eaten a total of 54 pieces of candy (20 + 34 = 54). Then, if he also ate 18 more pieces of candy, he would have eaten a total of 72 pieces of candy (54 + 18 = 72). Therefore, Bob ate 72 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  First, Bob ate 21 candies. Then he ate 5 more candies. So, in total, Bob ate 26 candies. Now, we need to find out how many pieces of candy are left after Bob ate 9 more candies. To do this, we divide the number of candies Bob ate (26) by the number of pieces of candy he ate at one time (9). Therefore, there are 3 pieces of candy left after Bob ate 9 more candies.
Response:  The boy ate 22 candies at first and then ate 5 more after that. So, he ate a total of 22 + 5 = 27 candies. Therefore, there are still 8 candies left.
Response:  First, Bob ate 19 candies. Then he ate 2 more candies. So, in total, Bob ate 19 + 2 = 21 candies. Now, we need to find out how many pieces of candy are left. If Bob ate 21 candies and there were originally 30 pieces of candy, then the number of pieces of candy left is 30 - 21 = 9. Therefore, 9 pieces of candy are left.
Response:  If Bob ate 32 pieces of candy and he had 20 left, then he must have eaten a total of 52 pieces of candy (32 + 20 = 52). Therefore, Bob ate 52 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  If Bobbi had eaten 17 pieces of candy initially and then ate 15 more, he would have eaten a total of 32 pieces of candy (17 + 15 = 32). So, there would be 4 pieces of candy left (36 - 32 = 4).
Response:  At first, there were 30 candies and Bob ate 23 of them. So, now there are 7 candies left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack brought 3 balloons. So, in total, there are 8 balloons (5 + 3) at the park. Therefore, Alan has more balloons than Jack.
Response:  Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. So, Jake has more balloons than Alan in total. The difference between their number of balloons is 3 (Jake has 3 more balloons). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Alan brought 3 balloons to the park and he took 2 of them back home, then how many balloons did Jack bring to the park? We know that Jack brought fewer balloons than Alan, so the answer is 1 or less. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons to the park and Alan brought 4 more than Jake, then Alan brought 10 balloons (4 + 6 = 10) to the park. Therefore, the number of balloons that Alan brought to the park is 10.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack brought 6 more than Alan, then Jack brought 11 balloons (6 + 5) to the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Jack brought to the park is 11.
Response:  Alan brought 3 balloons to the park and Jack brought 5 balloons to the park. So, in total, they had 8 balloons (3 + 5) at the park.
Response:  Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and Jack brought 4 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 6 balloons (2 + 4 = 6). Then, Alan went back to the park and got 3 more balloons, so now he has 9 balloons (6 + 3 = 9). Therefore, Jack has 7 balloons left (4 - 3 = 7).
Response:  Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and Jack brought 6 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 8 balloons (2 + 6 = 8). Then, Alan went back to the park and brought 3 more balloons, so now he has 11 balloons (8 + 3 = 11). But Jack still has 6 balloons at the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons that Jack has and the number of balloons that Alan has is 5 (11 - 6 = 5).
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack brought 4 balloons. So, together they have 9 balloons (5 + 4 = 9). Then, Alan added 3 more balloons to the total, so now they have 12 balloons in the park (9 + 3 = 12). Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jack brought 2 balloons. So, together they have 8 balloons in the park (6 + 2 = 8). Then, Jack went back to the park and brought 3 more balloons, so now they have 11 balloons in total (8 + 3 = 11). Therefore, Alan has 3 more balloons than Jack (11 - 8 = 3).
Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jack brought 3 balloons. So, together they have 9 balloons in the park (6 + 3 = 9). Then, Jack went back to the park and brought 4 more balloons, so now he has 13 balloons in total (3 + 4 = 13). Therefore, Jack has 4 more balloons than Alan in the park.
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack brought 6 balloons to the park. So, in total, there are 11 balloons at the park (5 + 6 = 11). Therefore, Jack brought 4 more balloons than Alan to the park (11 - 5 = 4).
Response:  Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the factory, while Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the factory. If they both went to the park together, how many balloons would they have in total?  We can start by adding the number of balloons that each person brought to the park: 3 + 5 = 8 balloons. So, together, Alan and Jake had 8 balloons at the park.
Response:  Alan brought 7 balls and Jack brought 6 balls to the park. So together they have 7 + 6 = 13 balls.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons and both he and Jack went to the park together, then Jack must have brought at least 1 more balloon than Alan, since they went to the park together. Therefore, the number of balloons that Jack brought is greater than or equal to 6 (the total number of balloons brought by both). So, the answer is 7.
Response:  Alan brought two balloons to the park and then created three more balloons there. So, he had five balloons in total at the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now, let's consider Jack's case. If Jack brought six balloons to the park, then he has six balloons in total at the park (6 = 6). Since we know that Alan had five balloons at the park, and Jack also has six balloons at the park, we can conclude that Jack has one more balloon than Alan at the park (6 - 5 = 1). Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. If he invests more time in English than Chinese, it means he is spending X hours studying English and Y hours studying Chinese, where X > Y. So, the difference between the number of hours spent studying English and Chinese is X - Y. Therefore, the answer is X - Y.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how much more time he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the time spent studying English from the total time spent studying both languages. So, the difference is: 6 hours (studying English) - 7 hours (studying Chinese) = 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than English.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and another few hours studying Chinese every day. If he spends a total of 4 hours studying both languages each day, then we can calculate the time spent on Chinese language as follows: Time spent on Chinese = Total time studied / 2 (Since he studies both languages simultaneously) So, if Ryan spends a total of 4 hours studying both languages daily, then the time he spends on Chinese is: Time spent on Chinese = 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours per day Therefore, Ryan spends 2 hours studying Chinese every day.
"Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and some time studying Chinese. If he spends an additional 2 hours studying English instead of Chinese, then he will spend x hours studying Chinese. We can set up the equation as follows:  Ryan's total study time = 7 + 2 = 9 hours/day So, if Ryan studies Chinese for x hours/day, his total study time for Chinese will be 9 - x hours/day Now we need to find out how many hours Ryan spent studying Chinese before. To do this, we can use the information given in the problem that Ryan studied Chinese for ""a few hours"" per day. Since we don't know exactly how many hours this is, let's assume it's between 1 and 5 hours/day (since there are only five options). Therefore, the possible values for x are: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hours/day. Now we can calculate the total number of hours Ryan spent studying Chinese using the formula above: Total study time for Chinese = 9 - x hours/day For each value of x, we can plug it into the formula and solve for the total number of hours Ryan spent studying Chinese: 1 hour/day: Total study time for Chinese = 9 - 1 = 8 hours/day 2 hours/day: Total study time for Chinese = 9 - 2 = 7 hours/day 3 hours/day: Total study time for Chinese = 9 - 3 = 6 hours/day 4 hours/day: Total study time for Chinese = 9 - 4 = 5 hours/day 5 hours/day: Total study time for Chinese = 9 - 5 = 4 hours/day Based on these calculations, we can conclude that Ryan spent between 4 and 5 hours/day studying Chinese before he increased his study time by 2 hours/day."
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and also studies English for several hours, then if he adds 2 more hours to study Chinese, how many hours will he spend studying English in total?  We can calculate this as follows:  Total time spent studying Chinese = 5 hours/day x number of days studied = X hours Total time spent studying English = original time + additional time = X + Y hours Where X is the original time (in this case, 2 hours) and Y is the additional time (in this case, 2 hours). Therefore, the total time Ryan will spend studying English is X + Y = 2 + 2 = 4 hours. So, Ryan will spend 4 hours studying English in total.
"Response:  Ryan studies English and Chinese for 6 hours and 7 hours respectively every day. If he continues to study for 5 days, then he will have studied English and Chinese for a total of:

English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
Therefore, Ryan will have spent a total of 65 hours studying English and Chinese over the course of 5 days."
"Response:  Ryan studies English for 6 hours and Chinese for 5 hours every day. If he spends 2 days studying, he will spend a total of:

6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours studying English
5 hours/day x 2 days = 10 hours studying Chinese
Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 22 hours studying English and 10 hours studying Chinese over the course of two days."
Response:  Ryan studies English for 5 hours and Chinese for 4 hours every day. If he continues to study for 6 days, then... (1 hour x 6 days = 6 hours) + (5 hours x 6 days = 30 hours) + (4 hours x 6 days = 24 hours) = Total time spent studying English = 36 hours Total time spent studying Chinese = 54 hours So, in total, Ryan spends 90 hours studying both languages over 6 days.
Response:  Ryan studies English and Chinese for 4 hours per day, respectively. If he continues to study for 86 days, then... (1) The total number of hours he spends studying English is 4 x 86 = 352 hours. (2) The total number of hours he spends studying Chinese is also 4 x 86 = 352 hours. So, in one day, he spends 352/24 = 14.5 hours studying both languages combined.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 7 hours studying Chinese. So he spends a total of 13 hours (6 + 7) studying languages every day. However, he also spends 3 hours studying Spanish. Therefore, the total time he spends studying languages is 13 hours plus 3 hours, which equals 16 hours per day.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 3 hours learning Chinese. So, he spends a total of 9 hours (6 + 3) per day on language studies. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends on Spanish. Since he spends 58 hours on Spanish, that means he dedicates 67% of his daily language study time to Spanish (58/9 = 0.63). Therefore, Ryan invests more time in Spanish than in Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 9 hours (7 + 2) studying languages every day. Now, let's compare this to how much time he spends studying Spanish. According to the question, Ryan spends 4 hours studying Spanish every day. So, compared to English, he spends 50% more time studying Spanish (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 7 hours (2 + 5) studying languages every day. Now, let's compare how much time he spends studying Spanish compared to Chinese. He spends 4 hours studying Spanish, which is less than the total amount of time he spends studying languages (7 hours). So, Ryan spends 3 hours more studying Chinese than Spanish (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and Chinese. If he studies English for 2 hours every day, how many hours will he spend studying Chinese?  To find out, we need to subtract the time he spends studying English from the total time he spends studying both languages each day. So, if Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying both languages, and he studies English for 2 hours of that time, then he will spend 1 hour (3 - 2) studying Chinese each day. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 hour.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. So in total, he spends 9 hours (4 + 5) studying languages per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 63 hours (9 x 7) studying languages over the course of one week.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 8 cans for recycling. The next day, she found 7 more cans. So, in total, Tiffany collected 8 + 7 = 15 cans for recycling.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 7 cans for recycling. The next day, she found 12 more cans to add to her collection. So, in total, Tiffany collected 19 cans (7 + 12) over two days. Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 400 containers. The next day, she found more cans and now has 6 bags in total. So, if there were x cans on the second day, then Tiffany found x/2 cans on the second day. Therefore, the number of cans Tiffany found on the second day is 3x/2.
Response:  On Monday, she collected $10 in coins and brought 4 bags home.  The next day, she found $4 more coins and added them to her collection. So, at this point, she had $14 in total. Then, she went out again and collected another $8 worth of coins, bringing her new total to $22. Therefore, the answer is $22.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 10 cans. Then, on Tuesday, she found 3 more cans. Finally, on Wednesday, she found 7 more cans. Therefore, in total, she collected 20 cans.  So, the answer is 20.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 8 cans. The next day, she found 10 more cans. And then, on the third day, she discovered 4 more cans. So, in total, Tiffany found 22 cans after Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she had 3 containers. The next day, she found 7 more containers and 44 bottles. So, in total, how many containers did she have?  We can calculate this as follows: 3 + 7 = 10 containers. Therefore, she had 10 containers in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the bag. So, if we have x red apples, then we must have 16 + x green apples. Since we want to find out how many more red apples than green apples there are, we can set up an equation as follows:

x - (16 + x) = 17 - 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 17

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, there are 9 more red apples than green apples in the bag."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the bag. So, if we want to find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: Number of green apples = Total apples - Red apples = 11 - 5 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red apples and 3 green apples in the bag. If we have a total of 15 apples in the bag, then the number of green apples is equal to 15 - 10 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green apples in the bag.
Response:  If there are 3 red apples and 5 green apples in the bag, then the total number of apples is 3 + 5 = 8.  Now, if there are 10 more green apples than red apples, that means there are 10 x 5 = 50 green apples in addition to the 8 red apples, for a total of 8 + 50 = 58 apples in the bag. Therefore, there are 58 green apples in the bag.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples and 15 yellow apples in the bag. Since each apple is counted as one unit, we have:

Number of red apples = 7
Number of yellow apples = 15 x 1 = 15
Total number of apples = Number of red apples + Number of yellow apples = 7 + 15 = 22
Therefore, there are 22 apples in the bag."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples and 71 yellow apples in the bag.  To find out how many more green apples than red apples there are, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. So, the answer is:

Number of green apples = Total number of apples - Number of red apples
= 71 + 7 - 7
= 67
Therefore, there are 67 green apples in the bag."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 14 green apples in the bag. So, if we have x number of green apples, then the total number of apples is 6 + x. Since there are more than 14 green apples, we can say that x > 14. Therefore, there are at least 15 green apples in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red apples and 11 yellow apples in the bag.  Since we also know that there are more red apples than yellow apples, let's assume that there are x red apples more than yellow apples. Therefore, the number of red apples is 19 + x.  Now, we can find out how many yellow apples there are by subtracting the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 11 + (19 + x) = 30. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. So, there are 6 more red apples than yellow apples in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 90 yellow apples in the bag.  Since each apple is counted once, we have a total of 6 + 90 = 96 apples in the bag.  Therefore, there are 96 apples in the bag, including both red and green ones.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the bag.  Since each apple is counted once, we have a total of 18 + 14 = 32 apples in the bag. Therefore, there are 32 apples in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the bag. Since each apple is either red or yellow, we can conclude that there are at most 28 apples (5 + 14) in total. Therefore, the number of green apples must be less than or equal to 28 - 6 = 22. So, there are 22 green apples in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 65 bags of apples. Since each bag contains either 7 red apples or 3 green apples, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of apples = Number of red apples + Number of green apples. In this case, the total number of apples is equal to 65 x (7 + 3) = 65 x 10 = 650 apples. Therefore, there are 650 apples in all the bags combined.
Response:  We know that there are 11 bags of apples. Each bag contains either red or green apples. So, in total, we have 10 + 18 = 28 apples. Therefore, there are 28 apples in all 11 bags combined.
Response:  We know that there are 6 bags of apples in total. Inside each bag, we have a mix of red and green apples. In one bag, there are 16 red apples and 18 green apples. So, if we want to find out how many red apples are in one bag, we can divide the number of red apples (16) by the total number of apples in that bag (34). Therefore, there are 16/34 = 0.47 or approximately 1/2 red apple in each bag.
Response:  We know that there are 8 bags of fruit in total. Each bag contains either red or green apples. Since we don't know how many bags contain each type of apple, let's assume that the number of red and green apples is equal (i.e., 5 red apples and 5 green apples). Therefore, the total number of apples = 5 + 5 = 10 apples per bag x 8 bags = 80 apples in total. Now, let's find out how many green apples there are. Since there are 2 green apples in each of 4 bags, the total number of green apples = 2 x 4 = 8 green apples. So, the total number of apples = 80 red apples + 8 green apples = 88 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 12 bags in total (4 red apples + 3 green apples per bag). So, if we have x bags with only red apples, then the number of red apples is 4x. Similarly, if we have y bags with only green apples, then the number of green apples is 3y. Therefore, the total number of apples is 4x + 3y. Since there are 7 apples in each bag, the total number of apples is 7(4x + 3y). Solving for x and y, we get x = 6 and y = 5. So, there are 6 bags with only red apples and 5 bags with only green apples.
Response:  We know that there are 4 red apples and some green apples in each bag. So, if we have 12 bags in total, then the number of green apples is equal to 12 x (number of green apples per bag). Since each bag has 3 green apples, the total number of green apples is 12 x 3 = 36. Therefore, there are 36 green apples in total.
Response:  We know that there are 16 apples in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we have more green apples than red ones, then the number of green apples must be less than or equal to 13 - 16 = -3. Therefore, there are -3 green apples in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red apples and 4 green apples in the bag. If we have 15 bags, then each bag contains how many apples?  To find out, let's divide the total number of apples (19 + 4 = 23) by the number of bags (15). So, each bag contains 23 / 15 = 1.567 apples. Therefore, there are approximately 15.67 apples in each bag.
Response:  If there are 10 apples in total and they are equally distributed among 5 bags, then each bag will contain 2 apples (since 10 / 5 = 2).  Now, let's say that one of the bags contains 4 red apples and 6 green apples. In this case, the number of bags containing at least 4 red apples is 1 (the bag with 4 red apples), and the number of bags containing at least 6 green apples is also 1 (the same bag). Therefore, there are 2 bags in total that satisfy these conditions. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green apples and 60 yellow apples in the bag.  Since red apples are worth twice as much as yellow apples, we can calculate the number of red apples based on this ratio. So, if there are x red apples, then there are 2x yellow apples. Therefore, the total number of apples in the bag is 6 + 60 = 66 apples. Now, since there are more green apples than red apples, we can conclude that there are at least 66 - 6 = 60 yellow apples in the bag. Thus, there must be fewer than 60 green apples in the bag. The correct answer is (60 - 6) = 54 green apples.
Response:  At first, there were 4 action figures in Jerry's collection. Later, he added more action figures to his collection, making the total number of action figures 8. So, Jerry added 4 + 4 = 8 additional action figures to his collection.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures initially and later added 3 more. So, he had a total of 7 + 3 = 10 action figures in his collection. Therefore, Jerry had 10 action figures in his collection at first.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books initially. Later, he added 6 more action figures. So, in total, how many action figures did Jerry have after adding the new ones?  We can calculate this as follows: Initially, Jerry had 4 action figures + 6 new action figures = 10 action figures. Therefore, Jerry had 10 action figures after adding the new ones.
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures. So, in total, Jerry has: 5 + 7 = 12 action figures. Therefore, there are 12 - 9 = 3 more action figures than books.
Response:  Jerry had initially 2 action figures and 10 books in his room. Later, he added 4 more action figures, so now he has 6 action figures in total. Therefore, the number of books he has is: 10 + 6 = 16 books.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books initially. Later, he added 10 more books to his collection. So, in total, how many books did Jerry have after adding the new ones?  We can calculate this as follows:  Initially, Jerry had 9 books + 10 new books = 19 books. Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books initially. Later, he added 4 more books to his bookshelf. So, the total number of items Jerry has is: 7 + 2 = 9 action figures and 4 + 2 = 6 books. Therefore, there are 9 + 6 = 15 items in total.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books. Later, he added 9 more books to his collection. So, in total, Jerry has 16 (5 + 9) items in his collection - 4 action figures and 12 books.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures in his collection. Then he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, how many action figures does Jerry have now?  We can conclude that Jerry has 17 action figures in his collection (8 + 4 - 5).
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 3 action figures in his collection. Later, he added 4 more action figures to his collection, and then removed some of the old ones. If there are currently 6 action figures in Jerry's collection, that means he has removed 3 action figures from his initial collection of 3 + 4 = 7 action figures. Therefore, Jerry has removed 3 action figures from his collection.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures in his collection. Later, he added more and there were 10 old ones that he removed, so now he has 8 action figures in total. Therefore, Jerry added 3 (10 - 7) new action figures to his collection.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures in his collection initially and later added 2 more. He removed 7 old action figures from his collection. So, if Jerry has 10 action figures in his collection now, he must have had 8 + 2 = 10 action figures initially. Therefore, Jerry had 8 action figures initially.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 action figures in his collection. Then he added 7 more action figures to it. So, the total number of action figures Jerry has now is: 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 action figures in Jerry's collection.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures, so the total number of action figures he had was: 4 + 2 = 6 action figures. Therefore, there were 6 - 3 = 3 more action figures than books.
"Response:  Jerry initially placed 7 books and 3 action figures on his bookshelf. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the collection. So, in total, there were:

Books: 7 + 2 = 9
Action Figures: 3 + 2 = 5
Therefore, the answer is 9 books and 5 action figures."
Response:  If there were initially two birds sitting on the branch and more birds joined them later, then the total number of birds on the branch at any given time can be represented as follows:  Branch size = Initial birds + Newly arrived birds  Since we are told that more birds joined the initial two birds, let's assume that the total number of birds on the branch at any given time is equal to the sum of the initial two birds and the newly arrived birds.  Therefore, if there were initially two birds on the branch (A), and more birds joined them later (B), then the total number of birds on the branch at any given time can be calculated as follows: Total birds = A + B  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total birds = 2 + x  Where x is the number of birds that joined later.  Now, we are asked how many birds were on the branch in total. To find this out, we need to multiply the total number of birds on the branch by the number of branches available. So, the answer is: Total birds x Number of branches = 2 + x x 6 = 12  Therefore, there were 12 birds on the branch in total.
Response:  If there were initially 4 birds sitting in the tree and then 3 more birds joined them, then there are now 7 birds (4 + 3) sitting in the tree. So, if there are currently 5 birds sitting in the tree, then there were originally 3 birds sitting in the tree (5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, originally, 2 birds were sitting in the tree.
Response:  We know that there are initially 4 birds and 46 snakes in the pit. Then, 6 more birds join them. So, the total number of birds is now 10 (4 + 6).  As for the snakes, they remain unchanged at 46. Therefore, the final number of animals in the pit is 56 (46 snakes + 10 birds).
Response:  We know that there are initially 3 birds and 2 turtles sitting in the tree. Then, 5 more birds join them. So, the total number of birds is now 8 (3 + 5). As for the turtles, they remain at 2. Therefore, the final answer is: Birds - 8 Turtles - 2 = Total animals in the tree = 6
Response:  Initially, there were 3 birds and 4 tigers in the tree.  When two more birds joined, the total number of birds became 5 (3 + 2). So, the number of birds in the tree is 5. Now, let's count the number of tigers. There are initially 4 tigers in the tree. Since two more tigers joined, the total number of tigers becomes 6 (4 + 2). Therefore, the final answer is 5 birds and 6 tigers in the tree.
Response:  Firstly, there are 2 birds and 6 turtles sitting in a fence. Then, 3 more birds join them, making it 5 birds in total. Finally, there are more turtles than birds, so the number of turtles is greater than the number of birds. Therefore, the correct answer is: More turtles than birds.
Response:  We know that there are 4 crows and 6 foxes in total. When two more foxes join them, we have: 4 + 2 = 6 crows and 6 + 2 = 8 foxes. So, there are 6 crows and 8 foxes sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 tigers in the tree initially. Then, 6 other tigers join them. So, the total number of animals in the tree is:  Birds + Tigers = 3 + 4 = 7 Animals. Therefore, there are 7 animals in the tree.
Response:  We know that there are 6 birds and 3 tigers in total. When two more tigers join them, we have 2 + 2 = 4 additional tigers. So, now there are 3 + 4 = 7 tigers in total. Therefore, there are 6 - 7 = -1 bird left. In other words, there is only one bird left on the fence after the two extra tigers arrive.
Response:  Firstly, there are 4 birds and 3 tigers in total. Then, 6 other tigers join them, making it 10 animals in total (4 birds + 3 tigers + 6 new tigers). Finally, more tortoises than birds are present in the area, so the answer is 10 - 4 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 6 birds in total, and they are all sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds come along with 8 crows. So, now we have a total of 10 birds (6 + 4 = 10). Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  There are 2 birds sitting on the fence and 5 birds passing by. So, there are 7 birds in total (2 + 5). Now, let's count the number of hedgehogs. According to the question, there are 4 hedgehogs passing by. Therefore, the final answer is: 7 - 4 = 3 more birds than hedgehogs.
Response:  We know that there are initially 3 birds sitting on a fence. Then, 2 more birds join them, making it 5 birds in total. Next, 6 crows join them, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (5 + 6). Finally, we are told that there are even more turtles sitting on the fence than birds, so the total number of creatures on the fence is 11 + however many turtles there are = x. Therefore, the answer is x = 11 + 10 = 21.
Response:  We have 5 eagles and 3 sparrows initially sitting on the fence. If 4 more sparrows join them, then we have a total of 8 birds (5 eagles + 3 sparrows + 4 new sparrows). So, there are now more sparrows than eagles on the fence. Therefore, the number of eagles is less than the number of sparrows by 1 (5 - 8 = -3).
Response:  Firstly, there are 6 frogs and 2 birds in the pit. Then, 3 more birds join them, making it a total of 5 birds. So, the final number of creatures in the pit is 6 + 5 = 11.
Response:  Firstly, there are 3 birds sitting in a tree. Then, 6 eagles and 2 other birds join them. So, the total number of birds in the tree is: 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  The first book has 48 pages and the second book has 11 pages. So, the total number of pages in both books is 48 + 11 = 59 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the first book and the second book is 59 - 11 = 48 pages.
Response:  First page number is 37 and second page number is 80. So, total pages are 37 + 80 = 117 pages. Therefore, the difference between the two page numbers is 117 - 37 = 80 pages.
Response:  If there are 60 pages in the first part and 93 pages in total, then the number of pages in the second part is: Number of pages in second part = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first part = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second part of the book.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and the second chapter has 36 pages, we can say that the total number of pages in the first chapter is equal to the number of pages in the book minus the number of pages in the second chapter. So, if the book has 67 pages, then the number of pages in the first chapter is: 67 - 36 = 31 pages. Therefore, the answer is 31 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three sections in the book with different page counts as follows: Section 1 - 66 pages Section 2 - 35 pages Section 3 - 24 pages Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of these page counts: Total pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages So, the answer is 125 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages as follows:  Chapter 1 - 91 pages Chapter 2 - 23 pages Chapter 3 - 25 pages Now, we need to find out how many pages are there in total between the two chapters. To do this, we can simply subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: Number of pages between Chapters 1 and 2 = Number of pages in Chapter 1 - Number of pages in Chapter 2 = 91 - 23 = 68 pages Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the second chapter is 68 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and the second chapter has 18 pages less than the third chapter, which means it has 3 + 18 = 21 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the third chapter is 21 - 3 = 18 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, and the second chapter has 75 pages. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 128 pages. Now, we are asked how many pages are in the third chapter. Since the third chapter has only 21 pages, we can subtract this number from the total number of pages to find out how many pages are in the first two chapters. Therefore, the answer is 128 - 21 = 107 pages.
Response:  Since there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages So, there are 1931 pages in the book.
Response:  Since there are two chapters and each chapter has pages, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, if there are 23 pages in total and 2 chapters, we get: Number of pages in first chapter = 23 / 2 = 11 pages Therefore, there are 11 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  The book has two chapters and the second chapter is 68 pages long. So, the total number of pages in the book is:  Total pages = Number of pages in first chapter + Number of pages in second chapter  Total pages = x + 68  Since there are 2 chapters, we can write an equation:  Total pages = 2x + 68  Now, we need to solve for x (the number of pages in the first chapter). To do this, we can subtract 68 from both sides of the equation:  Total pages = 2x + 68 - 68  Total pages = 2x  Therefore, there are 34 pages in the first chapter (since 2x = 81 - 68).
"Response:  We know that 62 people went to camp in the morning and 39 people went in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who went to camp is:

62 + 39 = 101

Therefore, there were more people who went to camp in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  If there were 52 campers in the morning and 61 campers in the afternoon, then we can say that the number of campers who came in the afternoon is greater than those who came in the morning by 9 (61 - 52 = 9). Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  In the morning, 15 campers went to the beach.  After lunch, some of them returned and 8 more joined them.  So, in total, there were 23 campers at the beach after lunch.  Now, let's calculate how many campers are left for the evening.  We know that 32 campers went to the beach in the morning, so 9 campers remained behind (32 - 15 = 9).  Therefore, in the evening, 9 campers will go to the beach again.
"Response:  If there were 60 campers in total and some of them arrived in the morning and others in the afternoon, then we can say that... See the full answer

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If there were 60 campers in total and some of them arrived in the morning and others in the afternoon, then we can say that at least 30 campers arrived in the morning (since 7 of them did). Therefore, at most 30 campers arrived in the afternoon (since 30 + 7 = 60). So, the number of campers who arrived in the morning is between 23 and 30, inclusive."
Response:  In the morning, there were 36 campers. In the afternoon, there were 13 campers. And in the evening, there were 49 campers. So, the total number of campers during that day was:  36 + 13 + 49 = 108
Response:  We know that there are 44 people who go to camp in the morning, and among them, 39 people come back in the afternoon. So, the number of people who went to camp in the morning is equal to the number of people who came back in the afternoon minus the number of people who went to camp in the evening. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Morning - Evening = Afternoon Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Morning = 44 Evening = 31 Afternoon = 39 Substituting these values into the above equation, we get: 44 - 31 = 39 Solving for the difference between the number of people who went to camp in the morning and those who came back in the afternoon, we get: Difference = 34 (Answer) In other words, there were 34 more people who went to camp in the morning than those who came back in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, there were 53 campers who came.  In the afternoon, there were 48 campers who came.  And in the evening, there were 49 campers who came. So, we can see that more campers came in the evening than in the morning. Therefore, the answer is (Y).
Response:  In the morning, there were 33 campers.  In the afternoon, there were 34 campers.  And in the evening, there were 10 campers. So, the difference between the number of campers in the afternoon and those in the evening is:  34 - 10 = 24. Therefore, there were 24 more campers in the afternoon than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went out in the morning and 59 campers hiked in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went for a hike is 59 + 13 = 72 campers. Therefore, there were 72 people who went for a hike.
"Response:  If there were 29 campers in the morning and 66 campers hiked in the afternoon, then the number of campers who went hiking in the afternoon is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ campers\ who\ went\ hiking\ in\ the\ afternoon = 66 $$

Now, let's find out how many more campers went hiking in the afternoon than in the morning:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ campers\ who\ went\ hiking\ in\ the\ morning - Number\ of\ campers\ who\ went\ hiking\ in\ the\ afternoon = 29 - 66 = -37 $$

So, there were $37$ fewer campers who went hiking in the afternoon than in the morning."
Response:  We know that 41 campers went fishing in the morning and 4 of them went hiking in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went out for activities is 41 + 4 = 45. Now, we are told that 26 campers went out in the evening to go camping and take a walk. Therefore, the number of campers who did not go out for any activity is 45 - 26 = 19.
Response:  If there were 46 campers who went to bed at midnight and 43 of them woke up in the morning, that means 3 more people stayed up late than went to bed early. So, the number of campers who stayed up late is 3. Therefore, the number of campers who went to bed early is 43 - 3 = 40.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 apples from the tree and left 4 apples behind. Then she went to another tree and picked 2 more apples. So, in total, Rachel picked 5 apples (3 + 2 = 5). Now, we need to find out how many apples are left on the second tree. According to the problem, there were originally 7 apples on the tree, and Rachel picked 2 of them. Therefore, there are now 5 - 2 = 3 apples left on the second tree.
Response:  At first, there were 4 apples in Rachel's tree. She picked some and now there are 2 apples left. So, initially, Rachel had x = 4 apples. After she picked some, she had x - 1 = 3 apples. Now, we know that 2 apples are left, so x = 5. Therefore, Rachel initially had 5 apples in her tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and left 5 apples still on the tree. Of these 5 apples, 3 are ripe and 2 are not yet ripe. So, there are currently 3 ripe apples remaining on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 apples from the tree and left 7 apples remaining on the tree. If 6 of them are ripe and the other is not yet ripe, then there were initially 13 apples (7 + 6) on the tree. So, the number of ripe apples on the tree before Rachel picked any was 13 - 2 = 11.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 6 apples from the tree and left 2 unpicked. So, there are 2 + 6 = 8 apples in total on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 3 ripe apples from the tree and left 27 unripe ones. So, initially, there were 3 + 27 = 30 apples in the tree. Now, we are asked how many apples are left in the tree after Rachel took 3 of them. Therefore, the number of apples left in the tree is 30 - 3 = 27 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. After that, 2 new apples grew on the tree, so now there are 8 apples in total (7 + 2). Therefore, there were originally 6 apples on the tree before Rachel picked any (8 - 6 = 6).
Response:  At first, there were two apples in Rachel's tree. Then, after she picked one of them, there were three new apples grown on the tree. So, currently, how many apples are there in the tree?  We can conclude that there are now five apples in Rachel's tree (2 + 3 = 5).
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two apples from the tree and there are still 7 apples left on the tree after she picked them. So, initially, there were 52 - 2 = 50 apples on the tree. Therefore, the number of apples on the tree before Rachel picked any was 50.
Response:  At first, there were 3 trees with apples.  Each tree had 8 apples, so the total number of apples was 3 x 8 = 24 apples.  Then, Rachel picked 8 apples from each tree, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 apples on each tree. So, there are now 3 x 16 = 48 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 7 apples from each of the 3 trees, so she has picked in total 7 x 3 = 21 apples. Now, we are told that there were originally 29 apples on the tree, so after Rachel picked some, there are still 29 - 21 = 8 apples left on the tree. Therefore, Rachel picked 21 apples.
Response:  Edgar had more marbles than Doug did.  If Edgar lost some of his marbles at the park, then he has fewer marbles now than he had before.  How many marbles does Doug have left if Edgar lost some at the park?  We know that Edgar had more marbles than Doug did initially, so let's call the number of marbles Edgar had x. Since Doug had y marbles initially and lost some at the park, we can say that Doug has y - x marbles left now.  Now, we are told that Edgar has z marbles now, where z is the difference between the number of marbles Edgar had before and the number of marbles Doug had initially. So, we can set up the equation: x + (y - x) = z. Solving for y, we get: y = z / (x + 1). Substituting this value back into the original equation, we get: x + (z / (x + 1)) = z. Simplifying, we get: 2x + z = 2z. Solving for x, we get: x = z / 3. Therefore, Edgar had 3 times as many marbles as Doug did initially.
Response:  Edgar has 45 marbles and Doug lost 11 marbles at the park. So, Doug now has 34 marbles left (34 - 11 = 23). Now, we need to find out how many more marbles Edgar has than Doug. To do this, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the total number of marbles Edgar has: 45 - 23 = 22. Therefore, Edgar has 22 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  Edgar has more marbles than Doug. If Edgar had 22 marbles and lost 7 of them, then he has 15 marbles left. Since Doug has none, he must have gained some marbles from Edgar's loss. So, the number of marbles that Doug now has is equal to the difference between the total number of marbles Edgar had (22) and the number of marbles he had after losing 7 (15). Therefore, Doug has 7 marbles.
Response:  Edgar has more marbles than Doug. If Edgar had 27 marbles and lost 3 at the park, then he has 24 marbles left. Since Doug started with fewer marbles than Edgar (Doug had 0 marbles initially), Doug must have had at least 1 marble to start with. Therefore, Doug had 1 marble initially.
Response:  Ed found 9 more marbles than Doug in the playground. So, if Ed had 18 marbles initially (including the ones he lost), and Doug had 27 marbles initially, then after they searched for marbles, Ed would have 9 + 18 = 27 marbles, which is the same number as Doug had initially. Therefore, Ed does not have more marbles than Doug.
Response:  Edgar has more marbles than he had before because he lost 17 balls at the park. So, if he had x marbles before, then after losing those balls, he has x - 17 marbles. Since he now has more marbles than before, we can say that x - 17 is greater than zero. Therefore, the number of marbles Edgar has is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 17.  In other words, the range of possible values for x is from 1 to 16.
Response:  Edgar had more marbles than he did before (he lost some). Now, Edgar has even more marbles than before (he found some). So, Edgar gained marbles. The number of marbles Edgar gained is equal to the difference between the number of marbles he had after losing some and the number of marbles he had before losing any. Therefore, the answer is:  Marbles gained = Number of marbles after losing - Number of marbles before losing = 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.
Response:  Edgar has more marbles than Doug because he has 91 marbles and lost only 21 marbles. So, Edgar had initially 91 - 21 = 70 marbles more than Doug. Therefore, Edgar had 70 + 21 = 91 marbles in total.
Response:  Edgar has more balls than Doug at the start (Edgar has 20 balls and Doug has 17 balls). So, if Edgar loses some balls in the game, he will have fewer balls than Doug. Therefore, the number of balls that Doug currently has is greater than or equal to the number of balls that Edgar has minus the number of balls that Edgar lost during the game. In other words, Doug has at least 13 balls (20 - 7 = 13).
Response:  If Sophia asked 408 students to suggest additional menu items and 42 of them suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who suggested adding kimchi than those who suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding kimchi is greater than 42.  So, the answer is (greater than 42).
Response:  If Sophia asked 479 students to suggest additional menu items and 489 students suggested adding bakery products, then we can conclude that there are 479 + 489 = 968 total suggestions for additional menu items.
Response:  Sophia asked 310 students to suggest specific types of food for lunch. 185 students suggested adding potatoes and only 65 students suggested adding bacon. Therefore, 65 students suggested bacon.
Response:  Sophia asked for suggestions from 288 students regarding a specific type of food to be added to their menu. Of these, 264 students suggested adding bacon, while other students proposed adding mashed potatoes (which is not mentioned in the passage). Therefore, we can conclude that 104 students proposed adding mashed potatoes.
Response:  If Sophia suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 457 students voted in favor of it, then there are 457 students who want potatoes added to the menu.  Now, let's consider the number of students who wanted to add bacon. According to the question, 210 students voted for bacon, which means that 210 - 457 = 247 students did not vote for bacon. Therefore, if 63 students voted for bacon among those who did not vote for potatoes, then the total number of students who voted for bacon is 63 / 247 = 25. So, there are 25 students who voted for bacon.
Response:  If Sophia suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 94 students agreed, then there are 73 students who did not agree (182 - 94 = 73).  Now, if 50 of those 73 students who did not agree also suggested adding beef, then there are 23 students left who did not suggest anything (73 - 50 = 23). Therefore, if 166 students suggested adding bacon, then there are 43 students who did not suggest anything (23 + 143 = 166). So, out of the total number of students, 43 students did not suggest anything.
Response:  If Sophia asked 324 students to suggest a specific type of food for lunch and 374 students suggested dumplings, then 128 students suggested benedictine. Therefore, the final menu will include dumplings, benedictine, and tomatoes.
Response:  If 257 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 120 students suggested adding beans, then there are 377 students in total (257 + 120 = 377). If 97 students suggested adding tomatoes, then there are 474 students in total (377 + 97 = 474). Therefore, the correct answer is 474.
Response:  If 144 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 467 students suggested adding beans, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding beans. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested adding beans by (467 - 144) = 323 students.
Response:  If 228 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 337 students suggested adding beans, then there are more students who suggested adding beans than those who suggested adding potatoes. So, among the students who suggested adding vegetables (potatoes or beans), there are 337 - 228 = 109 students.
Response:  Sophia asked students to suggest one of 66 types of food for lunch. If 450 students suggested potato dumplings and 38 students added bacon to the menu, then how many students did not participate in suggesting new food items? Solution: To find out how many students did not participate in suggesting new food items, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested potato dumplings (450) from the total number of students (488). Therefore, 138 students did not participate in suggesting new food items.
Response:  If Sophia asked 218 students to suggest additional menu items and 351 of them suggested adding bacon, then we can conclude that 351 - 218 = 133 students added bacon as their suggestion. Therefore, 133 students added bacon as their suggestion.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, and 330 students suggested adding mushroom kebabs, then there are 599 students in total (269 + 330 = 599).  If 76 students suggested adding tomatoes to the menu, then there are 675 students in total (599 + 76 = 675).
Response:  We know that there are 569 female students and 236 male students in total. So, to find out how many more females than males there are, we can subtract the number of males from the number of females: 569 - 236 = 333 Therefore, there are 333 more female students than male students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. So, we can write this as an equation: Girls = 34 Boys = 841 To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys: Boys - Girls = 841 - 34 = 807 Therefore, there are 807 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school. Of these, 232 are female and 253 are male. So, among the males, how many are there?  Therefore, the number of male students is 253.
Response:  If there are 697 female students and 463 male students in total, then the number of male students is less than the number of female students by 228 (i.e., 697 - 463 = 228). Therefore, there must be at least 228 male students in the school.
Response:  If there are 635 female students and 510 more male students than females, then the total number of students in the school is: 635 + (510 - 635) = 1145 Students. Therefore, there are 1145 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 girls in the school and 507 boys. So, if 281 of the girls are older than the boys, then the number of boys is:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls who are older than the boys = 868 - 281 = 587 Therefore, there are 587 male students in the school.
Response:  If there are 700 female students and 558 male students in total, then the number of male students is 142 more than the number of female students. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Male Students = Female Students + 142 We know that the total number of students is 700 + 558 = 1258 Therefore, if we substitute the value of 142 into the above equation, we get: Male Students = 1258 + 142 = 1390 Now, we have found out that there are 1390 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in the school initially. Then, 418 more girls enrolled in the school. So, the total number of students in the school now is: 706 + 418 = 1124. Therefore, there are 1124 students in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school initially. Then, 44 more girls enrolled in the school, so the total number of girls is now 902 + 44 = 946. Therefore, the number of girls in the school currently is 946.
Response:  We know that there are 632 female students and 410 male students in the school initially. Then, 465 more girls enrolled in the school. So, now we have: Total Female Students = 632 + 465 = 1097 Female Students Total Male Students = 410 Now, we can see that the number of female students is greater than the number of male students by 687 - 410 = 277. Therefore, the answer to your question is 277.
Response:  We know that there are 732 female students in the school and 761 male students. When 682 girls join the school, we have to subtract them from the total number of females. So, the remaining number of female students is: 732 - 682 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 female students in the school right now.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in school. So, the total number of students is 135 + 214 = 349. Now, we need to find out how many boys are currently in school. Since 496 girls and 910 boys enrolled in school, the number of boys who enrolled is 910 - 214 = 706. Therefore, there are 706 boys in school right now.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now, we have to find out how many teachers are there in the school. According to the question, there are 36 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 626 : 36 = 17 : 1.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we have to find out how many teachers are there in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 624/772 = 0.83. So, there are approximately 83% of students in the school.
Response:  If there are 402 more female students than male students in the school, then the total number of male students is:  Total number of male students = Number of male students - Number of female students  Therefore, the number of male students in the school is:  Male students in the school = 739 - 402 = 337 males.
Response:  We know that there are 458 more female students than male students in this school. So, if there are x male students, then there are x + 458 female students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is x + 458 = 692. Thus, there are 692 students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 male students and 257 female students in the school initially. Then, 403 more girls enrolled in the school. So, the total number of female students now is: 257 + 403 = 660 female students. Therefore, the difference between the number of male and female students is: 362 - 660 = -318. Hence, there are -318 more females than males in the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. Now he has $... (Do you want to know how much money Edward has left?)
Response:  Edward had $13 initially and spent some of it. Now he has $3 left. So, Edward spent $\frac{13 - 3}{3} = \frac{10}{3}$ of his initial amount.
Response:  Edward spent $9 and then $8 more, so he has a total of $17 now. To find out how much money Edward had before spending any money, we can subtract the amount he spent from his current balance: $17 - ($9 + $8) = $17 - $17 = $0. Therefore, Edward had $0 before spending any money.
Response:  Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, and each book cost the same amount of money ($16). Now he has $6 left after buying the books. So, before spending the $16, Edward had $6 + $6 = $12.
"Response:  Edward spent $6 to buy two books. Now he has $12 left. If one book costs the same amount as what he spent for both books, then... (more)

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Edward spent $6 to buy two books. Now he has $12 left. If one book costs the same amount as what he spent for both books, then each book cost $6 / 2 = $3."
Response:  Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on a pen, so he had $22 left before spending $19. Therefore, Edward had $3 ( $22 - $19) left after buying the book and pen.
Response:  Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so he has $7 left ($12 - $4 - $3). Therefore, Edward spent $7 on books and pens combined.
Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. Now there is $19 available. To find out how much more Edward spent on books than on pens, we need to subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount available: $19 - $8 = $11. So, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Edward spent $17 and received $10 from his friend. Now he has $7 left. So, before spending any money, Edward had $7 + $10 = $17.
Response:  David made 58 push-ups more than Jackie did, and they both did 44 push-ups in their physical education class today. So, if we add the number of push-ups that David did to the number of push-ups that Jackie did, we get: 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, David and Jackie together did 102 push-ups in their physical education class today.
Response:  Jackie pushed 51 times and David pushed 44 times. So, to find out how many more pushes Jackie made than David, we need to subtract David's number of pushes from Jackie's number of pushes: 51 - 44 = 7. Therefore, Jackie made 7 more pushes than David.
Response:  David made 44 push-ups today in gym class. Then he did 9 more than that, which means he did 53 push-ups total. So, Jack did 53 - 44 = 9 push-ups.
Response:  David made 51 push-ups today in gym class and Jack did 49 more than him. So, Jack did 100 push-ups (51 + 49). Therefore, David and Jack together did 100 + 100 = 200 push-ups.
Response:  David made 19 more push-ups than Jake did. If Jake did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches, then he did a total of 103 exercises (59 + 44). Since David did 19 more push-ups than Jake, David did a total of 103 - 19 = 84 exercises. Therefore, David did 84 push-ups and crunches in total.
Response:  David made 29 push-ups and Jaakari made 44 push-ups. So, David did more than Jaakari by 15 push-ups (44 - 29 = 15).
Response:  David did 17 push-ups and crunches, while Jackari did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. So, if we want to find out how many push-ups and crunches Jackari did, we can subtract the number of push-ups and crunches that David did from the total number of push-ups and crunches that Jackari did. In this case, Jackari did 53 + 14 = 67 push-ups and crunches more than David. Therefore, the answer is 67.
Response:  David did 58 push-ups and crunches, while Jakaari did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. To find out how many more push-ups Jakaari did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Jakaari did. So, the answer is:  Jakaari did 23 more push-ups than David (58 - 35 = 23).
Response:  David made 38 push-ups and crunches respectively, while Jakaari did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches. So, Jakaari did more push-ups (46 - 38 = 18) and fewer crunches (58 - 46 = 12) than David. Therefore, Jakaari did 18 + 12 = 30 more exercises than David.
Response:  David pushed the ball 39 times more than Jack did. John pushed it 13 times less than David did. So, if David pushed the ball x times, then Jack pushed it x - 39 times. Therefore, David pushed the ball x + 39 times.
Response:  David made 22 push-ups more than Jake, and John made 4 fewer push-ups than David. So, if David did x push-ups, then Jake did x - 22 push-ups, and John did x - 4 push-ups. Therefore, John did 36 push-ups.
Response:  David made 39 more push-ups than Jackie and John did 9 fewer push-ups than David. So, if we subtract 9 from 39, we get 30. Therefore, Jackie did 30 more push-ups than John.
Response:  David pushed up 30 more than Jakari in PE class today, so David did 37 push-ups and Jakari did x push-ups. We know that David did 37 push-ups, so we can set up the equation: x = 37 - 30 = 7. Therefore, Jakari did 7 push-ups.
Response:  David pushed up 56 more than Jack and then he did 38 push-ups himself. So, in total, David and Jack did 94 push-ups (56 + 38).
"Response:  David pushed up 40 times but got less than Jakari in athletics class. If Jakari did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches, then David did... (Do you want to continue?)  Of course! Based on the information provided, we can calculate that David did 18 crunches. Here's how we know:

David pushed up 40 times, which means he did 40 x 1 = 40 crunches.
Jakari did 34 + 62 = 96 crunches.
So, David did 40 - 96 = 56 crunches fewer than Jakari."
Response:  David pushed up 36 more than Jack did in Push-ups and 33 less than Jack did in Crunches. If Jack did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then David did __________ push-ups and __________ crunches.
Response:  David pushed up 27 times but Jakari did 7 less push-ups than him in physical education class. If Jakari did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, then he had how many more crunches than David?  We can conclude that Jakari had 10 more crunches (17 - 5 = 12) than David.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, if we subtract the number of pages she had for reading comprehension from the total number of pages she had for homework, we get: 5 - 2 = 3 pages. Therefore, there were 3 more pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  Rachel had to do 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, in total, she did $3 + 4 = 7$ pages of homework. Therefore, she read $7 - 3 = 4$ more pages than she did math homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework and also needs to read more than 7 pages of literature for her assignment, then we can calculate the number of pages she needs to read as follows: Number of pages of literature = Total pages of homework - Number of pages of math homework = 7 - 5 = 2 pages So, Rachel needs to read 2 pages of literature for her assignment.
Response:  If Rachel has to read more than 4 pages of math homework, then she needs to read x pages of reading comprehension homework to make up for it. Since she completed 3 pages of reading comprehension homework, we can set up the equation: x = 7 - 3 = 4. So, Rachel needs to read 4 pages of reading comprehension homework to make up for the extra math homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to read 8 pages of math homework and she wants to have more than 3 pages extra, then she needs to read at least 5 pages (8 - 3 = 5) more. So, in total, Rachel needs to read 13 pages (5 + 8) of math homework.
"Response:  If Rachel has to do 8 pages of math homework and she needs to have more than 6 pages more than the math homework, then we can say that the total number of pages of homework Rachel needs to do is:

8 + (6 - 1) = 8 + 5 = 13 pages

So, Rachel needs to do 13 pages of homework."
Response:  If Rachel has to do 10 pages of math homework and she needs to have more than 3 pages more than the math homework, then we can say that the total number of pages she needs to do is: Total pages = 10 + (3 x Number of pages of math homework) So, if the number of pages of math homework is x, then the total number of pages Rachel needs to do is: Total pages = 10 + (3x) Therefore, the answer is 13 pages.
Response:  Firstly, Rachel has to complete 2 pages of math homework, which means she needs to write 2 x 4 = 8 lines of answers. Then, she has to read and annotate 3 pages of reading comprehension, which requires her to write 3 x 5 = 15 lines of notes. Finally, she has to complete 10 pages of biology homework, which involves writing 10 x 6 = 60 lines of explanations or answers. Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to write 8 + 15 + 60 = 83 lines of answers.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 9 pages of math homework and completed 2 pages in one hour. Therefore, she completed 9/2 = 4.5 pages per hour for math homework. Now, let's find out how many pages she completed for biology homework. The question states that she spent 96 minutes on biology homework, which is equal to 1.6 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, she completed 1.6 x 4.5 = 7.2 pages for biology homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages she completed for math and biology homework is 7.2 - 4.5 = 2.7 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 11 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading comprehension homework, and 3 pages of biology homework. So, in total, she had 11 + 2 + 3 = 16 pages of homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of math pages and biology pages is 16 - 3 = 13 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to read 8 pages of biology homework, which is equal to 8/12 = 0.67 pages per day. Now, we know that she read more than 11 pages of reading comprehension and 7 pages of math homework. So, let's calculate how many days it took her to finish each assignment:  Days for reading comprehension = 11 pages / 0.67 pages per day = 16.4 days Days for math homework = 7 pages / 0.67 pages per day = 10.9 days Therefore, Rachel finished the biology homework in 0.67 days less than the reading comprehension assignment, and 3.5 days less than the math homework assignment.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, in total, she needs to finish 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework. Now, we are told that she completed 29 pages of biology homework. Therefore, we can deduce that she did not complete all of her homework, as there is a discrepancy between the number of pages she completed (29) and the amount of homework she had to do (20).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension homework.  Therefore, in total, she needs to finish 15 pages of homework (8 + 7).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework and 10 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 5 + 10 = 15 pages. Next, we are given that Rachel also has to complete 6 pages of biology homework. So, in addition to the 15 pages she already needs to complete, she now needs to complete an additional 6 pages, making the total number of pages she needs to complete 15 + 6 = 21 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 2 pages of reading homework and 4 pages of math homework to complete. So, if we subtract the number of pages she completed from the total number of pages, we get: Number of pages Rachel did not complete = Total number of pages - Number of pages completed = 8 - 2 = 6 pages. Therefore, there were 6 more pages of math homework than reading homework.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension, which is equal to 4/1 = 4 pages.  Secondly, she had to complete 7 pages of math homework, which is equal to 7/1 = 7 pages. Finally, she had to complete 19 pages of biology homework, which is equal to 19/1 = 19 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of math pages and biology pages is 7 - 19 = -12 pages. So, the answer is -12 pages.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 8 emails. Since we are asked if there were more emails received in the morning than in the afternoon, the answer is yes - there were 6 emails received in the morning versus 2 emails received in the afternoon, for a total difference of 4 emails. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 14 emails (6 + 8 = 14). Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning by 2 emails (8 - 6 = 2).
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and then received additional emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 5 emails that day. Therefore, he received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of... (calculate)...emails that day. Therefore, the answer is... (write the number).
"Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 13 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). In the evening, he received 72 emails. Therefore, the answer is:

A) 13 + 72 = 85 emails

Note: The question asks about the number of emails Jack received during different time periods, so we need to calculate the total number of emails he received based on the information provided in the question."
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). In the evening, he received an additional 8 emails, for a total of 17 emails that Jack received throughout the day. Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 7 emails during the day (3 + 4 = 7). In the evening, he received 8 more emails, so he received a total of 15 emails throughout the day (7 + 8 = 15). Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 17 emails that day. Now, we need to find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning: 17 - 7 = 10 Therefore, Jack received 10 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 10 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 19 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). In the evening, Jack received 7 emails, which is less than the total number of emails he received during the daytime. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the evening and the total number of emails he received during the daytime is 12 (19 - 7). So, Jack received 12 more emails during the daytime than he did in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 15 emails. In the evening, he received 4 more emails, so the total number of emails he received that day is 19. Therefore, the answer is (B) 19.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received some emails in the evening.  So, the answer is Yes, Jack received some emails in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning, and 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 3 + 64 = 67 emails and letters in one day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 67 / 2 = 33.5 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 11 messages (5 + 6 = 11). In the evening, he received 9 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 16 messages (9 + 7 = 16) during the day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 16/2 = 8 messages per day.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning, and then he received 3 more emails and 44 more letters in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails Jack received is:  10 + 3 = 13 Emails  And the total number of letters Jack received is:  12 + 44 = 56 Letters  Therefore, there are 13 more emails than letters that Jack received in the afternoon compared to the morning.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning, and 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, the total number of letters he received in the morning is 8 + 7 = 15, and the total number of emails he received in the afternoon is 2. Therefore, the difference between the number of letters Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is 15 - 2 = 13.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 8 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 8/2 = 4 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and sent 2 letters. Then he received 6 more emails and sent 8 letters in the evening. So, how many emails did Jack receive and send in total during one day? We can calculate it as follows: Total number of emails = Morning emails + Evening emails = 4 + 6 = 10 Emails sent = Morning letters + Evening letters = 2 + 8 = 10 Therefore, Jack received 10 emails and sent 10 letters during one day.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in total during one day. If he received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he received X emails in the afternoon. Since there are 9 emails in total, we can write an equation: 7 + X = 9. Solving for X, we get: X = 2. So, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 8 emails that day. However, we are asked if there were more emails received in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is yes, there were more emails received in the morning (5 - 3 = 2).
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, 6 emails in the morning, and additional emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails he received that day is: 3 + 6 + x = 10 (where x is the number of additional emails he received in the evening). Therefore, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  The length of the frog is given as 12 inches and that of the grasshopper as 9 inches. So, we have: Frog = 12 inches Grasshopper = 9 inches Now, we are asked how much farther the grasshopper jumps than the frog. To find this out, we need to subtract the length of the frog from the length of the grasshopper: Distance = Grasshopper - Frog = 9 inches - 12 inches = 3 inches Therefore, the grasshopper jumps 3 inches farther than the frog.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches. So, if we want to find out how far the crab jumped, we need to add the distance that each of them jumped. Therefore, the crab jumped 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 36 inches and the frog jumped 17 inches more than the grasshopper. So, the distance between the frog and the starting point of the grasshopper is:  Distance = 36 + (17 - 0) = 53 inches  Therefore, the frog was 53 inches away from the starting point of the grasshopper.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 25 inches and the frog jumped 18 inches more than the grasshopper. So, the distance between the frog and the starting point of the grasshopper is:  Distance = 25 + (18 - 0) = 43 inches  Therefore, the frog jumped 43 inches away from its initial position.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the crab ran 19 inches and the frog 10 inches more than the crab. So, the distance traveled by the frog is 19 + 10 = 29 inches. Now, we are told that the mouse ran 20 inches further than the frog. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the mouse is 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the newt (메뚜기) jumped 19 inches and the frog (개구리) jumped 39 inches more than the newt. So, the distance traveled by the frog is: 39 + 19 = 58 inches.  Next, we are told that the mouse (쥐) jumped less than the frog. The difference in distance between the frog and the mouse is given as 94 inches. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is: 58 - 94 = -36 inches. Since negative numbers indicate leftward movement, the mouse moved leftward by 36 inches.
Response:  The frog jumped 25 inches and the grasshopper jumped 25 + 1 = 26 inches. So, the difference between their jumps is 26 - 25 = 1 inch. Therefore, the mouse jumped 1 inch.
Response:  The frog jumped 24 inches and the mouse jumped x inches. Since the frog jumped farther than the mouse, we know that x = 33 - 5 = 28 inches. Therefore, the mouse was 28 inches away from the starting point.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 13 inches and the frog jumped twice as far as the grasshopper, which means it jumped 26 inches. So, the distance the frog jumped was 26 inches.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 35 inches and then flew 4 inches further away from it. So, in total, the grasshopper flew 41 inches away from its original position.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the crab ran 19 inches and the frog 4 inches more than the crab. So, the frog ran 23 inches (19 + 4). Now, we are told that the mouse ran 44 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the difference between the distance traveled by the frog and the distance traveled by the crab. Hence, the mouse ran 67 inches (23 - 44 = 67).
Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches and the mouse jumped x inches less than that. So, if we call the distance the mouse jumped as y inches, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Frog's distance = 39 inches Mouse's distance = y inches - 19 inches Now, we are asked to find out how many inches the mouse jumped. Therefore, we need to solve for y. Substituting the values given in the question into the above equation, we get: y = 12 inches Solving for y, we get: y = 10 inches So, the mouse jumped 10 inches.
Response:  The length of the jump made by the frog is given as 21 inches (70 cm), and that of the mouse is given as 16 inches (40 cm) less than the frog's jump. So, if the frog jumps 25 inches (63 cm) further than the frog, then the distance between the frog and the mouse would be:  Distance = 25 inches + 16 inches = 41 inches (104 cm) Therefore, the frog is 41 inches (104 cm) away from the mouse.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped compared to the grasshopper, we need to divide the distance of the frog's jump by the distance of the grasshopper's jump. So, if the frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches, then the ratio of their jumps is 39/17 = 2.26. Therefore, the frog jumped 2.26 times farther than the grasshopper.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 9 inches and the mouse jumped 3 inches less than that. So, the mouse jumped 6 inches (9 - 3 = 6). Now, we know that the grasshopper jumped 33 inches more than the mouse. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 42 inches (33 + 6 = 42).
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 14 inches and the mouse jumped less than that. If the mouse jumped 16 inches shorter than the grasshopper, then the distance between them is: Grasshopper - Mouse = 14 inches - 16 inches = 2 inches So, the mouse was 2 inches away from the grasshopper.
Response:  If we have already added 5 cups of flour and need to add another cup of flour, then we will have a total of 6 cups of flour. So, we need one more cup of sugar than what is mentioned in the recipe. Therefore, we need 7 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that we have already added 4 tablespoons of flour to the mixture and now we need to add more sugar. To find out how many tablespoons of sugar we need to add, we can divide the total amount of sugar (11 tablespoons) by the amount of flour (4 tablespoons). So, we need to add 2.75 tablespoons of sugar (11 - 4 = 7 / 4 = 2.75).
Response:  We have been given that Mary wants to make 6 jars of cake and she needs 13 cups of sugar. So far so good! However, we are also told that Mary has already added 8 cups of flour, which means we need to subtract 8 cups from the total amount of sugar required. Therefore, we need an additional 5 cups of sugar (13 - 8 = 5).  So, Mary will need to add 5 more cups of sugar to make her 6 jars of cake.
Response:  According to the recipe, we need flour (11 tablespoons) and sugar (7 tablespoons). So far, you have added 8 tablespoons of flour (2 more than the required amount). Therefore, you still need an additional 3 tablespoons of flour.
Response:  If we already added 3 tablespoons of flour and the recipe calls for 6 tablespoons in total, then we need to add 3 more tablespoons of flour. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Mary wants to make cake with flour and sugar according to the recipe, she needs 12 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. So far so good! However, if she decides that she needs an additional 2 cups of flour, then we can calculate how much more flour she needs as follows:  Additional flour needed = Total amount of flour required - Amount already used = 12 cups (total) - 9 cups (already used) = 3 cups Therefore, if Mary needs an additional 2 cups of flour, she will need 3 cups in total.
Response:  If we have already added 3 cups of flour and 62 tablespoons of sugar to the recipe, then we need to add an additional amount of flour that is equal to the difference between the total amount of flour required (9 jars) and the amount of flour we have already added (3 cups). Therefore, the additional amount of flour needed is: 9 - 3 = 6 cups. So, we need to add 6 more cups of flour to the recipe.
Response:  If we have already added 10g of flour and 2g of sugar to the mixture, then according to the recipe, we need to add an additional 4g of sugar (14 - 10 = 4). Therefore, we should add 4g more sugar to the mixture.
Response:  If we have already added 11 cups of flour to make the cake according to the recipe, and the recipe calls for an additional 3 cups of flour, then we need to add another 3 cups of flour to the mixture. Therefore, in total, we will need 14 cups of flour (11 + 3) to make the cake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar.  If we add 7 cups of flour more than what is required in the recipe, then we will have 17 cups of flour (10 + 7 = 17).  Now, let's calculate how much sugar we need to add based on this new amount of flour.  We know that the ratio of flour to sugar in the recipe is 3:2, so if we increase the flour by 7 cups, we must also increase the sugar by 4 cups (2 x 7 = 14). Therefore, the total amount of sugar needed in the revised recipe would be 16 cups (2 + 14 = 16).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the recipe calls for 12 tablespoons of flour and 14 tablespoons of sugar.  If we add 2 tablespoons of flour more than the required amount, it means we need to add 10 tablespoons (12 - 2 = 10) more of flour.  Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is 12 + 10 = 22 tablespoons.
Response:  We have already added 7 jars of sugar to the mixture, so if we want to add more sugar, we need to subtract 7 from the total amount of sugar needed. Therefore, we need an additional 1 jar (or 8 tablespoons) of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary wants to make cake with flour 12 cups and sugar 13 cups according to the recipe. So far, she has added 2 cups of sugar. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 13 - 2 = 11 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 11 cups of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary wants to make cake with flour and sugar according to the recipe. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. So far, she has added 4 cups of sugar. To determine how many more cups of flour are needed, we need to subtract the amount of sugar already added from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe. Therefore, the number of additional cups of flour needed is: 9 - 4 = 5 cups.
"Response:  We have been given that Mary wants to make a cake with 6 jars of sugar and 9 cups of flour. So far, she has added 2 cups of flour. To determine how many more cups of flour are needed, we need to subtract the amount of flour already added from the total amount required. Therefore, the number of additional cups of flour needed is:

6 jars of sugar - 2 cups of flour = 4 cups of flour needed

So, Mary needs an additional 4 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that we have already added 11 jars of flour (which is equal to 11/4 = 2.75 cups) and now we need to add more sugar (equal to 5 cups). So, we need to subtract 2.75 cups from 5 cups to find out how many cups of sugar we need to add next. Therefore, we need to add 2.25 cups of sugar (5 - 2.75 = 2.25).
Response:  Firstly, we are asked to mix 3 tablespoons of sugar and 10 teaspoons of flour according to the recipe. So far so good! However, the question then states that if we have already added too much flour (which is not specified), we need to subtract 5 teaspoons from the total amount of flour used. Therefore, if we have already added 10 teaspoons of flour, we would need to subtract 5 teaspoons, making the correct amount 5 teaspoons.
Response:  We are given that we need to mix 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour to make cake according to the recipe.  If we have already added 12 cups of flour, then we still need to add how many more cups of flour?  Therefore, the answer is 1 cup of flour.
Response:  We have already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to make 6 cups of cake mix. To find out how much more flour we need, we can subtract the amount of flour we have from the total amount required. So, the difference is: 7 - 6 = 1 cup of flour needed. Therefore, we need an additional 1 cup of flour to make the full 6 cups of cake mix as requested.
Response:  If we have already added 12 tablespoons of sugar and 10 tablespoons of flour to make 1 cup of cake mix as per the recipe, then...  We need to add more sugar if...  So, to find out how much more sugar we need to add, let's subtract the amount of sugar we have already added (12 + 10 = 22 tablespoons) from the total amount of sugar required for one cup of cake mix (11 tablespoons)... Therefore, we need to add an additional 1 table spoon of sugar.
"Response:  We have 6 cups of flour and we want to know how much more flour we need to add to make 8 cups of flour total. So, we can start by subtracting the amount of flour we already have (6 cups) from the desired total amount (8 cups):

6 cups - 6 cups = 0 cups

So, we don't need to add any more flour to reach 8 cups."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to make the cake mixture.  If we add more flour than sugar in the recipe, the ratio of flour to sugar will be off, and the cake may not turn out well. So, we need to adjust the amount of flour accordingly.  Based on the ingredient list provided, if we want to add an additional 3 cups of flour, we would need to subtract 3 x 4 = 12 tablespoons of sugar from the original amount of 14 tablespoons. Therefore, the new total amount of sugar needed for the revised recipe would be 14 - 12 = 2 tablespoons.
Response:  We have 9 jams and 7 sugar, so we need to calculate how much jam is needed for each spoonful of dough.  If we use 2 spoons of dough per spoonful of jam, then we will need 9/2 = 4.5 jars of jam for one spoonful of dough. Since there are 10 spoons in a jar, we will need 4.5 x 10 = 45 jars of jam total. Therefore, we need an additional 45 - 9 = 36 jars of jam.
Response:  If we have already added 11 tablespoons of sugar and want to add more, then we need to find out how much more sugar is needed based on the original amount of sugar called for in the recipe. The recipe calls for 12 tablespoons of sugar total, so if we have already added 11 tablespoons, we need to add an additional 1 table spoon (or 15 ml) of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 12 - 1 = 11 tablespoons of sugar.
Response:  We know that we need to add 3 more tablespoons of sugar (7 - 4 = 3). So, we need to add 3 more tablespoons of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  We are given that Mary wants to make cake using a recipe that requires sugar and flour in certain proportions. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. However, Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar. To determine how many more cups of flour Mary needs, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount of flour required in the recipe. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 4 cups of flour (14 - 10 = 4).
Response:  If 60 birds have left for warmer places to escape winter and there are currently 19 birds remaining in the mountain, then we can calculate the number of birds that remained behind as follows: Number of birds remaining = Total number of birds - Number of birds that left for warmer places = 60 - 19 = 41 birds. Therefore, 41 bird families remain in the mountain during winter.
Response:  If 7 bird families left for warmer places during winter, and there are 87 birds in total near the mountain, then we can assume that before they left, there were 87 - 7 = 80 birds remaining at the mountain. Therefore, the number of bird families that remained at the mountain is 80 / 7 = 11 bird families.
"Response:  We know that 20 birds migrated for winter and 14 stayed behind. So, if we assume that all of these birds are living in the same area near the mountain, then... See full solution

Answer:  There were 66 birds (20 + 14) living near the mountain before migration."
Response:  If 23 birds from the total of 85 birds migrated to Africa and 37 birds migrated to Asia, then the number of birds remaining in the mountain is:  Number of birds remaining = Total number of birds - Number of birds that migrated to Africa - Number of birds that migrated to Asia = 85 - 23 + 37 = 45 birds. Therefore, there are 45 bird families left in the mountain.
Response:  We know that 42 birds migrated to Africa and 31 birds migrated to Asia. So, the total number of birds that migrated is 42 + 31 = 73 birds. Therefore, there are 73 more birds in Africa than in Asia.
Response:  If 47 birds migrated to Africa and 94 birds migrated to Asia, then the total number of birds that migrated is: 47 + 94 = 141. So, there are 10 more birds that migrated to Asia than to Africa (141 - 47 = 94).
Response:  If 18 birds are staying near the mountain and 38 birds flew to Africa, then there are 20 (18 + 38) birds left in the mountain area.  If 80 birds flew to Asia from this remaining number of birds, then the total number of birds that flew away is 60 (80 - 20). Therefore, 60 birds flew away for winter.
Response:  If 87 birds are already living near the mountain and 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is: $87 + 18 = 105$ families. Therefore, there are $105$ bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 49 birds are staying in the mountain area and 24 birds are living near the North Pole. So, the total number of birds left in the mountain area is 49 - 24 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 birds remaining in the mountain area.
"Response:  If 27 birds migrated to warmer areas and there were originally 41 birds living near the mountain, then...

Answer:  There would be 14 birds left in the area (41 - 27 = 14)."
Response:  If winter has almost arrived and most animals are migrating to warmer places, then we can assume that 86% of the total number of birds have already migrated. So, if there were initially 100 bird families living near the mountain, then 86 families (or 86%) have migrated, leaving 14 families behind. Therefore, 45 bird families are left in the area.
Response:  If 35 birds migrated to Asia and 62 birds migrated to Africa, then the total number of birds that migrated is: 35 + 62 = 97 birds. So, more birds migrated to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that 26 birds migrated from the North Pole to the mountain area and 2 of them flew further south after spending winter there. So, the number of birds left in the mountain area is:  Number of birds = Total birds - Birds that flew south = 26 - 2 = 24 birds. Therefore, there are 24 birds left in the mountain area.
"Response:  We know that Polo received 253 pencils as a gift for his birthday and he lost or misplaced 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, the number of pencils Polo had left at the end of the school year is:

253 - 70 = 183

Therefore, Polo had 183 pencils left at the end of the school year."
Response:  We know that Pol received 551 pencils initially and lost or gave away 374 of them. So he had 177 pencils left. Now, we need to find out how many days passed between his birthday and when he ran out of pencils. Let's assume that it took him exactly one year to use up all the pencils. Then, we can calculate the number of days since his birthday as follows: Number of days = (Current day - Birthday) / 365 Days per year Where current day is the day when he ran out of pencils, which is equal to 177 pencils. Therefore, the answer is: Number of days = (177 -  ) / 365 = 177 / 365 = 0.5 years Or approximately 6 months.
Response:  Poll received 440 pens from his friends during his birthday celebration and gave away 111 pens to his friends throughout the year. So he has 329 pens left (440 - 111 = 329).
Response:  Poll received 65 pens from his friends during his birthday celebration and gave away 213 pens to his friends throughout the year. So he has given away a total of 213 + 65 = 278 pens. Therefore, 278 - 16 = 262 pens were left or donated.
Response:  Poll received 589 pens as birthday gifts and gave away 571 to his friends during the school year. So he has 161 pens left. To find out how many more pens he gave away than what he received, we need to subtract the number of pens he had left from the number of pens he gave away: 161 - 161 = 0. Therefore, poll gave away 0 more pens than what he received.
Response:  Poll received 110 pens as birthday gifts and gave away 90 to his friends during the school year. So he has 210 pens left (110 - 90 = 21). Then, in the problem statement, it is mentioned that Poll lost 412 pens. Therefore, the difference between the number of pens Poll gave away and the number of pens he had left is 412 - 210 = 202 pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received 563 pens as gifts from his friends during one school year. Then, he gave away 558 pens to his friends, which means he has 332 pens left. So, if Pol received 332 pens on his birthday, then he received 332/563 = 0.60 (or 60%) of the total number of pens given to him as gifts.
Response:  Poll received 52 pens as birthday gifts and gave away 535 pens to his friends during one school year. So he had 492 pens left. To find out how many pens were lost or donated, we need to subtract the number of pens he gave away from the total number of pens he received. Therefore, the answer is: 535 - 52 = 483 pens were lost or donated.
Response:  Poll has received 521 pens and 66 jars of eraser as birthday gifts. At the end of his school year, he still had 154 pens left even though he lost one jar of eraser. Therefore, the number of pens that were given away or donated is 367 (521 - 154).
Response:  We know that Polo received 531 pencils and 38 erasers as gifts for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had only 391 pencils left, but he didn't lose any erasers. So, there were more than 391 pencils remaining after the school year ended. In fact, there were 140 additional pencils (531 - 391 = 140). Therefore, the answer is 140.
Response:  Poll has 601 pencils and 406 spiders at the end of his school year. If he didn't lose any pencils during that time, then he had 295 pencils left (601 - 306 = 295). So, there are 295 - 406 = 111 more spiders than pencils left with Poll.
Response:  We know that Polo received 291 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift, and he lost or gave away 144 boxes (315 - 291 = 144). So, the number of boxes of crayons Polo had after his birthday is: 291 - 144 = 147 boxes. Therefore, Polo received 147 boxes of crayons on his birthday.
Response:  Poll received 267 pens as birthday gifts during his school year and lost 231 of them. He gave away 308 pens to friends. So, he had 36 (267 - 231) pens left after giving away some to friends. Now, let's find out how many more pens he gave away than what he had initially. We can do this by subtracting the number of pens he had left from the total number of pens he gave away: 36 - 308 = -332. Therefore, he gave away -332 more pens than what he had initially.
Response:  We know that Polo received 457 gifts of sweets and 320 gifts of crackers. At the end of his school year, he had only 523 items left, including neither sugar nor crackers. So, there were more than 320 crackers but fewer than 457 sweets remaining at the end of the school year. Therefore, the number of crackers remaining is between 320 and 457, inclusive.
Response:  At first, the waiver had 11 customers. Then, 2 of them left, leaving him with 9 customers. After that, another customer left, leaving him with 8 customers. So, in total, he lost 3 customers (2 + 1 = 3). Therefore, out of all the remaining customers, he has 5 more customers than the number who left (8 - 3 = 5).  Hence, there are 5 more customers left with him now compared to when he started.
Response:  At first, the waiver had three customers. Then two of them left, leaving him with one customer. After that, another customer joined him, making it two customers again. Finally, one more customer left, leaving him with his original three customers. So, in total, there were three customers who left before he reached four customers. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers. After that, 12 more customers came in. So, initially there were 9 + 12 = 21 customers.
Response:  We know that there were initially 14 customers and 5 of them left. So, the remaining number of customers is: 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, 9 customers are still left with the waiver.
Response:  At first, the personal trainer had 13 customers. Then, some of them left and he gained 4 new customers. So, the total number of customers at this point is: 13 - (number of customers who left) + 4 =?  Since we are given that 9 customers remained with the personal trainer after some of them left, we can set up an equation as follows: 13 - (x) + 4 = 9 where x is the number of customers who left. Solving for x, we get: x = 4 Therefore, there were 4 customers who left the personal trainer. So, the final number of customers the personal trainer has is: 13 - 4 + 4 = 9.
Response:  Initially, the personal trainer had 12 customers. Then, 3 customers left, leaving him with 9 customers. Finally, he gained 6 new customers, so the total number of customers he has now is 15. Therefore, there are still 6 customers remaining.
Response:  The waieter had 3 customers initially and then more people arrived so he had 8 customers in total. So, new customers who came after that are 5 (8 - 3 = 5).
Response:  At first, the personal trainer had 8 customers. Then, 3 of them left, leaving him with 5 customers. Later, he gained 99 new customers, so how many customers did he have in total after that?  Therefore, the answer is 104 (5 + 99).
Response:  Initially, the personal trainer had 12 customers. Then, 3 of them left, leaving him with 9 customers. Later, he gained 10 new customers, so now he has 19 customers in total. Therefore, there are currently 19 customers for the personal trainer.
Response:  Dan spent $2 on candy and has $3 left. So initially, he had $5 ($2 + $3).
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys candy worth $3. So, he is left with $1.
Response:  Dan has $4 and spent $99 for 3 candies at $3 each. So he has $4 - $99 = $-95 left.
Response:  Dan has $3 and spent $4 for 2 candies. So he had $3 - $4 = $1 left after buying the candies. Now let's calculate how many candies he bought. If he spent $4 for 2 candies, then each candy cost $4 / 2 = $2. Therefore, Dan bought 1 candy.
Response:  Dan has $20 and buys an ice cream that costs $3. So he is left with $17 ($20 - $3). Then, he spends $6 for the ice cream, so he is left with $11 ($17 - $6). Therefore, Dan spent $11 on the ice cream.
Response:  Dan spent $7 dollars and bought candy worth $2 dollars at $1 dollar each and chocolates worth $3 dollars at $0.50 each. So, he spent a total of $7 + $2 + $3 = $12. Therefore, there is $5 left over ($12 - $7).
Response:  Dan spent $4 dollars on candy bars and $6 dollars on chocolates. So he spent a total of $10 ($4 + $6). Therefore, Dan spent $10 to buy candy bars and chocolates.
Response:  Dan spent $2 on candy and $6 on balloons. So he had $4 left ($6 - $2 = $4). Then, he spent $3 on chocolates. So now he has $1 left ($4 - $3 = $1). Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Dan spent on candy and the amount he spent on chocolates is $3 ($3 - $1 = $2).
Response:  Dan spent $2 on candy and $3 on chocolate. So he spent a total of $2 + $3 = $5. Therefore, Dan spent $5 on sweets.
Response:  Dan had $4 and spent $8 on candy. He then gave $5 to his friend. So, how much money did Dan have left?  We can start by subtracting the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $4 - $8 = $-4.  Therefore, Dan had $4 left after giving $5 to his friend.
Response:  If Dan spent $3 on candy and he had $4 initially, then he has $1 left after buying the candy. So, the candy bar cost $3 - $1 = $2.
Response:  Dan had $4 and spent $10 for each of the 10 chocolates he bought, so he spent a total of $10 x 10 = $100. Now, let's check how much money Dan has left after buying those chocolates. He started with $4, and he spent $100, so he has $100 - $4 = $96 left. Therefore, there are $96 remaining in Dan's wallet.
Response:  Dan has $30 and he spent $15 on each of two candy bars. So, he has $30 - ($15 x 2) = $30 - $30 = $0 left. Therefore, he bought 0 candies.
Response:  Dan spent $3 on chocolate and $7 on candy. So he spent a total of $10. Now, we need to find out how much more money he spent on chocolate than on candy. To do this, we can subtract the amount he spent on candy from the total amount he spent: $10 - $7 = $3. Therefore, Dan spent $3 more on chocolate than on candy.
Response:  Dan spent $7 on chocolates and $2 on candies. So far, he has spent a total of $9 (7 + 2). Now, we know that he had $4 left after buying these items. Therefore, the amount he spent on chocolates is $7 - $4 = $3.
Response:  We know that Pollard had 115 books and he sold 78 of them. So, how many books are left with him now?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had.  Therefore, the answer is:  Books left with Pollard = 115 - 78 = 37.
Response:  At first, Poll had 137 books. After selling some of them, he was left with 105 books. So initially, Poll had more than 30 books (137 - 105 = 32).
Response:  If Poll has 108 books and sells some of them at a discounted price to his friends, then he will have fewer books left with him. Let's assume that he sold x books. Then, the number of books he has left is: 108 - x Therefore, if he sold 35 books to each of his 3 friends, he will have: (108 - 3x) books left. Now, we need to find out how many books he sold in total. Let's do this by using the information given in the question: He sold 35 books to each of his 3 friends, so he sold a total of 3 x 3 = 9 books to his friends. Now, let's subtract the number of books he sold from the initial number of books he had: 108 - 9 = 99 books. So, Poll sold 99 books in total.
"Response:  We know that Pollard had 50 books initially and he purchased 151 afterward. So, the difference between the number of books he had before and after purchasing is:

50 - 151 = -$101
Therefore, Pollard sold $101 worth of books."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Polo had 2 books initially and sold some of them to make a profit. We don't know exactly how many he sold, but let's assume it was 10 books. Now, he has 58 books left, which means he bought 48 new books (58 - 10 = 48). So, in total, Polo sold 10 + 48 = 58 books.
Response:  Poll has 21 books initially and sells some of them in the car park. Then he buys 42 new books. If he had 15 books left after selling some, then he sold more than 30 (21 - 15 = 30) books in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought is 30.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pollard had 71 books initially and sold some of them in the market. Then he bought 38 new books, so now he has 71 + 38 = 109 books. Therefore, if he had 116 books now, then he must have sold (116 - 71) = 45 books more than he originally had.
Response:  We know that Pollard had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So, the number of books Pollard sold is:  Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books left after selling = 108 - 66 = 42 books. Therefore, Pollard sold 42 books.
Response:  Firstly, Pollard had 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some of them, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. So, the number of books that Pollard sold is: 51 - 82 = 31 books. Similarly, the number of pens that Pollard sold is: 106 - 14 = 92 pens. Therefore, Pollard sold 31 books and 92 pens.
Response:  If Polo had initially 136 books and sold 27 of them, then he has 109 books left (136 - 27 = 109). Now, if he sold those 27 books at $5 each, his total revenue would be $27 x 27 = $729. So, Polo made $729 in profit from selling those 27 books.
Response:  Firstly, Pollard had 134 books and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, he sold some of them at Garaj's market and got back 68 books (he kept 27). Therefore, Pollard now has 68 books in total (95 + 68 = 163).
Response:  Poll had 95 pens and 153 books initially. After selling some of them, he had 13 books and 23 pens left. So, the number of books sold = 13 - 95 = 82 books. Similarly, the number of pens sold = 23 - 153 = -130 pens. Therefore, the answer is 82 books and -130 pens.
Response:  Firstly, Poll has 42 pens and 143 books. If he sells some of his books and uses the money to buy pens, then he will have fewer books but more pens than before. So, let's say he sold x books and used the money to buy y pens, where x and y are integers. After that, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. Therefore, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of books = 113 (since he has 113 books left) Number of pens = 19 ( since he has 19 pens left) Now, we need to find out how many pens Poll sold. To do this, we can use the fact that the number of pens he sold is equal to the difference between the total number of pens he had initially and the number of pens he had after selling some books. So, we can write another equation: Total number of pens = Initial number of pens + Number of pens sold Substituting the values we know into these equations, we get: Total number of pens = 42 + x Total number of books = 143 - x Now, we want to solve for x, which represents the number of pens Poll sold. We can do this by subtracting the initial number of pens from both sides of the first equation: 42 + x = 113 x = 71 This means that Poll sold 71 pens.
Response:  Initially, there were 10 flowers in the vase. Then, Zecha added 8 more flowers to the vase, so now there are 18 flowers in total (10 + 8 = 18). Therefore, there are 18 flowers in the vase.
Response:  Initially, there were 16 flowers in the vase.  Then, Zephyr added 10 more flowers to make it 26 flowers in total. Finally, she took out 10 more flowers to leave 16 flowers in the vase again. So, initially, there were 16 flowers in the vase.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 제시카 took 4 flowers from the vase and added them to the bowl. So, initially, there were 4 + 23 = 27 flowers in the bowl. Then, she picked some more flowers from the garden and added them to the bowl. However, the number of flowers she picked is not specified in the question. Therefore, we cannot determine exactly how many additional flowers she added to the bowl. Hence, the total number of flowers in the bowl after 제시카 finished arranging them is 27 + x, where x is the unknown number of additional flowers she picked. Since x is not given in the question, we cannot find out the exact number of flowers in the bowl after 제시카 finished arranging them.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 33 - 15 = 18 flowers were added to the vase after Zechaa had emptied it. So, initially, there were 15 + 18 = 33 flowers in the vase. Now, let's find out how many more flowers are present now compared to the number of flowers Zechaa had emptied from the vase. Therefore, the difference between the total number of flowers and the number of flowers Zechaa emptied is equal to the current number of flowers minus the initial number of flowers. Hence, the answer is: 33 - 15 = 18 more flowers than before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 21 flowers were in the vase initially. Then, Zecha took some of them from the garden and added them to the vase, so there are now 15 flowers in the vase. Therefore, the difference between the number of flowers Zecha took from the garden (34) and the number of flowers she put back into the vase (15) is equal to 19. So, Zecha picked up 19 more flowers than she put back into the vase.
"Response:  We know that 

1. Initially, 7 flowers were in the vase (flower bouquet).
2. Subtracting 59 flowers from the initial number gives us the number of flowers left after Zecha took some away = 7 - 59 = -52.
3. Since there are now fewer flowers than before, we subtract the number of remaining flowers from the total number of flowers to get the number of flowers taken by Zecha = -52 - 20 = -32.
Therefore, Zecha took 32 flowers from the flower bouquet."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that 

* 제시카 has 12 flowers in her garden (out of total 21). So, she has 9 (21 - 12) flowers left in the garden.

Therefore, there are 9 flowers remaining in the garden after 제시카 picked some from it."
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 flowers of roses and 62 flowers of daisies in the vase.  After Shirley picked some of them, there were 17 roses and 96 daisies left in the vase. So, we can calculate the number of roses that Shirley picked as follows: Number of roses picked = Initial number of roses - Number of roses after Shirley picked them = 15 - 17 = -2 Roses Picking no roses means picking negative numbers of roses. Therefore, Shirley picked -2 roses.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 flowers in total - 10 roses and 2 orchids.  After Jessica picked some of them, there were 10 rose flowers left, and she added 2 more orchids to the bouquet, making it 10 + 2 = 12 new flowers in total. So, the number of orchids Jessica picked is 2.
Response:  Initially, there were 5 roses and 3 daisies in the vase.  After Shirley arranged them, there were 12 roses and 2 daisies left in the vase. So, initially, there were more roses than daisies (5 vs 3). After arranging, there were still more roses than daisies (12 vs 2). Therefore, the number of roses after arrangement was greater than the number of daisies by 7 (12 - 2 = 7).
Response:  Initially, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase.  After Jessica arranged them, there were 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. So, the number of orchids after arrangement is 20 - 12 = 8 more than the original number of orchids. Therefore, the number of orchids after arrangement was 8 more than the number of roses.
Response:  If there were originally 3 flowers in the vase and she picked 5 flowers, then there are now 3 + 5 = 8 flowers in the vase. So, she must have taken out 11 flowers (8 - 3).
Response:  Initially, there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase.  After Jessica picked some of them, there were 91 orchids and 14 roses left in the vase. So, the number of roses that Jessica picked is: Number of roses = Total number of roses - Remaining number of roses = 13 - 14 = -1 Therefore, Jessica did not pick any roses.
Response:  We know that 16 flowers of roses and 3 flowers of chrysanthemums were initially placed in the vase.  After Shirley arranged them, there are 7 flowers of chrysanthemums and 13 flowers of roses left in the vase. So, the number of chrysanthemums that Shirley arranged is 7.
Response:  Initially, there were 6 flowers of lilies and 20 flowers of daisies in the vase.  After Shirley arranged them, there were 21 flowers of daisies and 22 flowers of lilies in the vase. So, the number of lilies is 22 - 6 = 16 more than the number of daisies. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  Initially, there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase.  After Jessica arranged them, there were 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So, the number of orchids after arrangement is 13 - 6 = 7 more than the original number of orchids. Therefore, the number of orchids after arrangement was 7 more than the number of roses.
"Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut it to 13 inches, then we can calculate how much she cut off as follows:

Length of original hair = 17 inches
Length of new hair = 13 inches

Subtracting the length of new hair from the length of original hair gives us the amount that was cut off:

Amount cut off = Length of original hair - Length of new hair
= 17 inches - 13 inches
= 4 inches

Therefore, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair."
Response:  If Robin cuts his 20-inch hair to 10 inches, then he will have 10 inches of hair less than before. So, the new length of his hair is 10 - 20 = -10 inches. Therefore, Robin's hair was -10 inches long before he cut it.
Response:  Firstly, Robin said her hair was 16 inches long. Then she cut it to 11 inches and after that, it grew back to 12 inches. So, we can conclude that Robin's hair length increased by 5 inches (12 - 11 = 5). Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 17 inches long (16 + 5 = 21).
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long and then grew an additional 18 inches, then its current length would be: $ \text{Current length} = \text{Original length} + \text{Additional growth} $ $\text{Current length} = 19 + 18 = 37$ inches. Therefore, if Robin's hair had grown an additional 18 inches after being 19 inches long initially, it would currently be 37 inches long.
Response:  If Robin had cut her hair from 13 inches to 10 inches, and then it grew back to 12 inches, we can calculate the current length of her hair as follows:  Current length = Original length + Growth + Cutting - Shrinkage Growth = 12 - 10 = 2 inches Shrinkage = 0 inches (since she didn't shrink her hair) So, the current length of Robin's hair is 12 inches.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 14 inches long and then grew to be 8 inches longer, it means that the new length is 22 inches (14 + 8 = 22). Then, if he cut it again and made it 20 inches shorter, the final length would be 4 inches (22 - 20 = 4). So, Robin's hair is now 4 inches long.
Response:  Dan has 12 cups of water and found 53 beads in the park. Now he wants to know how many cups of water are left. To find this out, we need to divide the number of beads he found (53) by the number of cups of water he had (12). So, there are 4.5 cups of water left (53 / 12 = 4.5).
Response:  Dan has 21 marbles and found 53 more in the park. So, altogether he found ${{21 + 53}} = 74$ marbles in the park$.
"Response:  Dan found 63 beads in the park and collected 51 old ones. Now he has 33 beads left in his collection. At first, Dan had how many cups?  We can conclude that Dan had at least 3 cups (since he collected 51 beads) but could have had more since we are told he had ""a few"" initially. So, the answer is 3 or more."
Response:  Dan collected 36 beads in total from the park and found that he had lost 13 old beads (35 - 13 = 22). So, he now has 22 beads left to collect. Therefore, the answer is Yes, Dan found more beads than he lost at the park.
Response:  Dan found 30 old cups in the park and collected them. Then he went back to his collection and added 12 more cups, so now he has 42 cups in total. So, the answer is Yes, Dan found more than 30 cups in the park.
Response:  Dan found 22 cups and 8 lids in the park initially. Now his collection has 28 cups and 63 lids. So, he had x cups and y lids initially, where x + y = 22 (the number of cups he found in the park) and x > 0 (since he didn't have any lids initially). Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, Dan had 4 cups initially.
Response:  Dan collected 22 pebbles and 30 wrappers in the park initially. Now he has 17 pebbles and 57 wrappers. So, initially he had 22 + 30 = 52 items. Therefore, Deni had 52 - 17 = 35 initial pebbles.
Response:  We know that Dan found 30 cups and 14 lids in the park initially. Now he has 7 cups and 86 lids. So, we need to find out how many more cups than lids he has now.  There are 7 cups and 86 lids, so the difference between them is 86 - 7 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more cups than lids in Dan's collection compared to what he found in the park.
Response:  Dan found 11 bottles and 28 packages in the park initially. Now his collection has 68 bottles and 51 packages. So he found more than 37 packages (68 - 31 = 37) after searching the park again.
Response:  According to the passage, Dan found 71 bottles and 24 packages in the park initially. Then he collected 28 more bottles and 16 more packages from other places. So, the total number of bottles Dan has now is 71 + 28 = 99 bottles. Similarly, the total number of packages Dan has now is 24 + 16 = 40 packages. Therefore, Dan currently has 99 bottles and 40 packages in his collection.
Response:  Dan has collected 27 beads and 43 packages so far. He found 10 beads and 62 packages in the park initially. So, he had 27 + 62 = 89 beads and packages initially. Now, he has 27 more beads than initial amount, which is 89 - 27 = 62 beads. Therefore, Dan currently has more packages than beads.  Hence, the answer is Yes.
Response:  At first, Dan lost 66 beetles in the park. Now he has only 25 left in his collection. So, initially, Dan had x cups of beetle cocoons. Since he lost 66 beetles and now has 25 left, we can set up the equation: x - 66 = 25. Solving for x, we get: x = 92. Therefore, Dan initially had 92 cups of beetle cocoons.
Response:  If Daniel found 32 beetles in the park and he collected 25 cupcakes, then we can conclude that he did not find any more than 8 cupcakes (32 - 25 = 8). Therefore, Daniel found 8 cupcakes at the park.
Response:  Dan collected 60 old bottles in the park and found 58 new ones. Now his collection has 67 bottles in total. So, initially, Dan had __________ cups (or bottles).
Response:  Dan collected 6 old bottles from the park and then found 50 new ones to add to his collection. So, he now has a total of 60 bottles in his collection. Therefore, the answer is Yes, Dan found more than the original number of bottles (6) after searching the park again.
Response:  Dan collected 54 old cups and found 48 new ones in the park. Now he has 52 cups in total. So, he found more than 16 additional cups (54 - 48 = 6). Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  Dan collected 82 packages and found 29 of them in the park. Now he has 42 packages and 61 containers in his collection. At first, he had some cups that he used to collect the packages. So, the number of cups he initially had is... (Answer: 7)
Response:  At first, Dan had 66 packages and 39 bottles in the park. Then he collected additional 16 bottles and 68 packages. So, initially, Dan had __________ (66 + 16 =) packages and __________ (39 + 16 =) bottles.
Response:  Dan found 46 packages and 50 bottles in the park. He now has 21 packages and 52 bottles. So he gained 39 packages (46 - 21) and 48 bottles (50 - 52). Therefore, there are more than 39 + 48 = 87 cups more than the number of cups he found in the park.
Response:  Dan collected 5 bags and found 65 bags in the park. So he has 31 bags left after collecting those from the park. Now, let's count how many more bags he found than what he already had. He found 9 more bags than what he already had (31 - 22 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 more bags than what he already had.
Response:  Dan found 58 bottles and 25 packages in the park. Now he has 11 packages and 12 bottles in his collection. So, the total number of packages is 11 + 58 = 69 packages. Similarly, the total number of bottles is 12 + 25 = 37 bottles. Therefore, Dan now has 69 packages and 37 bottles in his collection.
Response:  Dan has collected 15 bottles and 18 packages in the park. Currently, his collection consists of 67 packages and 35 bottles. So, Dan has more packages than bottles. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
Response:  Since Jake has 11 fewer apples than Steve, and Jake has 17 apples in total, we can deduce that Steve has 17 + 11 = 28 apples. Therefore, Steve has 28 apples.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, we know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen and more persimmons than Lily. We also know that Stephen has 14 more persimmons than Lily. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then he must have at least x - 7 persimmons. Therefore, Jake has at least 8 persimmons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen. Specifically, Jake has 18 persimmons less than Stephen. Therefore, if Stephen has x persimmons, then Jake has x - 18 persimmons.  Next, we are told that Steven has more persimmons than Liam. Specifically, Steven has 13 more persimmons than Liam. So, if Liam has y persimmons, then Steven has y + 13 persimmons.  Finally, we are asked how many persimmons each of them have in total. Based on the information given, we can calculate this as follows: Jake has x - 18 persimmons, and Steven has y + 13 persimmons, so their combined total is x - 18 + (y + 13) = 25.  Therefore, the number of persimmons each of them has is: Jake has 25 - (x - 18), and Steven has 25 + (y + 13).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Steve. Specifically, Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 3 apples.  Next, we are told that Steve has 8 more apples than Liam. Therefore, if Liam has y apples, then Steve has y + 8 apples.  Finally, we are given that Steve has 5 apples. So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 = (y + 8) - 5. Solving for x, we get x = 12. Thus, Jake has 9 more apples than Steve.
Response:  Since Jake has 12 fewer pears than Stephen and Stephen has 11 more pears than Liam, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake has x pears, Stephen has x + 11 pears, and Liam has x - 12 pears.  Now, let's solve for x to find out how many pears Jake has. We know that Jake has at least 4 pears (since he is not allowed to have less than 4), so we can set up the following inequality:  x >= 4.  Subtracting this inequality from both sides of the original equation gives us:  x + (x + 11) - (x - 12) = 0.  Simplifying this equation, we get:  3 = 0.  Therefore, Jake has exactly 3 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than Steven in terms of persimmons. So, if Jake has x persimmons and Steven has 16 persimmons, then we can say that Jake has x - 16 = 7 persimmons more than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 7 + 16 = 23 persimmons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has more than 7 apples and less than 8 apples than Stephen. So, Jake has 7 + x apples where x is the difference between his number of apples and 8. Therefore, Jake has 7 + x - 8 = 9 apples. Now, we can see that both Jake and Stephen have an equal number of apples, which means they both have 9 apples each.  Hence, the answer is 9 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has more than 9 pears and less than 18 pears than Stephen. So, the difference between their number of pears is between 9 and 18. Therefore, if Jake has x pears, then Stephen has x + 9 pears. Now, we are given that Jake has 25 pears, so we can find out how many pears Stephen has by subtracting 9 from 25: 25 - 9 = 16. Therefore, Stephen has 16 pears more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Stephen. Specifically, Jake has 6 fewer pears than Stephen. So if Stephen has x pears, Jake has x - 6 pears.  Next, we know that Stephen has more apples than Jake. Specifically, Stephen has 18 more apples than Jake. So if Jake has x apples, Stephen has x + 18 apples.  Finally, we are told that Jill has 5 apples. Therefore, if Jake has x apples and Stephen has x + 18 apples, then Jill must have x - 5 apples.  So, Jake has 9 apples (x = 9).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Stephen and that Stephen has more apples than Jacob. So, if Jacob has 87 apples, then Stephen must have at least 87 + 18 = 105 apples. Therefore, Jake has 105 - 5 = 100 apples.
"Response:  Since Jake has 16 fewer pears than Stephen, and Stephen has 15 more pears than Jake, we can write this as an equation:  S + 15 = J - 16 (where ""S"" represents the number of pears that Stephen has). Now, if Kyung has 12 pears, we can add this to both sides of the equation to find out how many pears Kyung has: K + 12 = S + 15 (since Jake doesn't have any pears, we can just ignore him in this equation). Solving for ""K"", we get: K = S + 7 Therefore, Kyung has 7 more pears than Stephen."
"Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So, if Jake has x apples and Steve has y apples, then we can write an equation as follows: 
x > y (Since Jake has more apples)  Now, we are given that Jake has 12 fewer apples than Steve. Can you use this information to find out how many apples Jake has? Try it!"
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So, Jake has at least 13 apples. Also, we know that Jake has fewer oranges than Steve. So, Jake has less than 9 oranges. Finally, we know that Jake has more pears than Steve. So, Jake has at least 3 more pears than Steve. Therefore, Jake has a total of 13 + 3 = 16 fruits.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jake has 6 more peaches than Steve and 8 more apples than Steve. So, if we write down what each of them have, it would be like this:
Jake: Peaches - 6 + Apples - 8 = 14 (total)
Steve: Peaches - 6 = 10 (total)
Apples - 8 = 9 (total)
Now, let's compare their total number of fruits. Since Jake has 14 fruits and Steve has 10 + 9 = 19 fruits, Steve has 5 more fruits than Jake. Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jake has 3 more peaches than Steve and 10 more apples than Steve. So, if we write down what each of them have, we get:
Jake: Peaches - 3 + Apples - 10 = 17
Steve: Peaches - 3 = 9 and Apples - 10 = 25
Now, let's compare their total number of fruits:
Jake: Total (Peaches + Apples) = 17
Steve: Total (Peaches + Apples) = 45 (since he has 9 peaches and 25 apples)
So, Steve has 28 more fruits than Jake. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Steve has 28 more fruits than Jake."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Steven has 12 apples and Jack has 8 apples less than Steven. So, Jack has 4 apples. Now, we are told that Steven has 67 more apples than Jack. Therefore, if Jack has x apples, then Steven has 67 + x apples.  So, the number of apples Jack has is x = 49.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Steven has 18 apples and Jack has 12 fewer apples than Steven. So, Jack has 6 (12 - 6) apples. Now, we are asked how many apples James has. Since James has 8 more apples than Jack, James has 8 + 6 = 14 apples. Therefore, James has 14 apples.
Response:  According to the question, Steven has 19 apples and Jake has more than Steven but less than 72. So, Jake must have 53 apples (19 + 33).
Response:  According to the problem statement, Steven has 14 peaches and Jake has more than 6 but less than 20 peaches. So, Jake has between 7 and 19 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 13 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So, Jake has at least 84 + 10 = 94 apples. Therefore, Jake has 94 apples and Steve has 52 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve and fewer peaches than Steve. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steve has x + 8 apples. Also, we know that Jake has less than 13 apples more than Steve. Therefore, the difference between Jake's apple count and Steve's apple count is at most 13 - (x + 8). Now, we can substitute the values of x = 13 and x + 8 = 20 to get the final answer: Jake has at most 20 apples.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jake has 8 apples and 10 pears, so he has a total of 8 + 10 = 18 fruits.  Now, we know that Steven has more fruits than Jake, so let's see how many fruits Steven has. We are told that Steven has 11 apples and 18 pears, so he has a total of 11 + 18 = 39 fruits. Therefore, Steven has 39 - 18 = 21 more fruits than Jake.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jake has 3 more apples than Steve and 4 more pears than Steve. So, if we write down what each of them have, we get:
Jake: Apples - 3, Pears - 18
Steve: Apples - 19, Pears - 15
Now, let's find out how many apples Steve has more than Jake:
Apples (Steve) - Apples (Jake) = 19 - 3 = 16
So, Steve has 16 more apples than Jake."
Response:  Oliva had $78 in her purse and spent $15 at the supermarket. So, she has $63 left ($78 - $15).
Response:  Oliva spent $78 at the supermarket and then she had $33 left. So, initially, Oliva had $78 - $33 = $45 more than what she spent at the supermarket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Oliva had $100 in her purse at the beginning. Then she withdrew an additional $48 from the ATM. After visiting the supermarket, she spent another $159. Therefore, the total amount of money Oliva spent is: $100 + $48 + $159 = $307. So, $307 was the amount left in Oliva's purse after all the transactions.
Response:  Firstly, Oliva withdrew $3 from her wallet at an ATM. Then she spent $49 at a supermarket. So, the amount of money left in her wallet after spending at the supermarket is $46 ($49 - $3). Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Oliva had after withdrawing from the ATM and the amount she had after spending at the supermarket is $43 ($49 - $6).
Response:  Firstly, Oliva withdrew $53 from an ATM and then spent $91 at a supermarket after that. So, the amount of money left in her wallet after visiting the supermarket is $14 ($53 - $91 = $14). Therefore, the difference between the amount of money she had before visiting the supermarket and the amount she had after visiting the supermarket is $14 ($14 - $53 = $39).
Response:  After visiting the supermarket and exhibition hall, $106 was left in Olivia's purse. If she spent $49 at the exhibition hall, then the remaining amount of money in her purse after that would be $57 ($106 - $49). So, Olivia spent $57 at the supermarket.
Response:  After Olivia visited Supermarket and spent $29, if she had $54 in her wallet initially, then she must have spent $\frac{29}{54}$ of her initial amount. So, she spent $5 \times \frac{29}{54} = 14.5$ dollars initially.
Response:  Oliva spent $38 at the supermarket and had $128 in her wallet before that. So, after spending $38, she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  Dave had 19 apps before he deleted 5 of them. So, he has 19 - 5 = 14 apps left.
Response:  Firstly, Dave had 18 apps installed on his phone and then he deleted 13 of them, leaving him with 5 apps. So initially, Dave had 5 apps installed on his phone.
Response:  Dave had 10 apps on his phone initially. He added 11 new apps, so he now has 21 apps in total (10 + 11 = 21). Later, he removed some of them, leaving him with 4 apps remaining. Therefore, the number of apps that Dave removed is equal to the number of apps he has left, which is 4. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  Dave had 21 apps initially and added 89 new ones after that. So, in total, he had 100 apps (21 + 89). Then, he deleted some of them, leaving 24 apps. Therefore, more apps were added than deleted. The correct answer is: Yes.
Response:  Dave had 15 apps on his phone initially. He added 71 new apps to it. After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 apps. So, more apps were deleted than added. Therefore, the answer is (B) More apps were deleted than added.
Response:  Dave had 16 apps and 77 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 apps and 23 files. So, the number of apps that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of apps (16) and the final number of apps (5). Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  Dave had 17 apps and 21 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 3 apps and 7 files. So, the number of deleted apps is 14 (17 - 3), and the number of deleted files is 14 (21 - 7). Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  Dave had 15 apps and 24 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he had 21 apps and 4 files left. So, the number of apps that Dave has now is: 21 - 15 = 6 apps.  And the number of files that Dave has now is: 4 - 24 = -20 files. Therefore, there are 6 apps and -20 files in Dave's phone now.
Response:  Dave had 19 apps and 18 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 6 apps and 15 files. So, the number of files that remained in his phone after deleting some apps is 15 - 18 = -3 files. Since there are no negative numbers in real life, we can assume that 3 files were added to his phone instead of being deleted. Therefore, the total number of files that Dave has now in his phone is 15 + 3 = 18 files.
Response:  Dave had 17 apps on his phone initially. If he added some more and then left 18 apps behind, we can conclude that he must have added at least 1 app to his initial collection of 17. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  Dave had 59 files and 15 apps before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So, the number of apps that Dave deleted is: Number of apps after deletion - Number of apps before deletion = 12 - 15 = -3 The number of files that Dave deleted is: Number of files after deletion - Number of files before deletion = 30 - 59 = -29 Therefore, Dave deleted 3 apps and 29 files.
Response:  Dave had 24 files and 13 apps in his handphone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So, the number of files that Dave deleted is 21 - 24 = -3 files.
Response:  Dave had 24 apps and 9 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 apps. So, the number of apps that Dave has after deleting some is 12 - 3 = 9 apps. Similarly, the number of files that Dave has after deleting some is 5 - 1 = 4 files. Therefore, the total number of apps and files that Dave has in his phone after deleting some are 9 + 4 = 13.
Response:  Dave had 11 apps and 3 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files and 2 apps left. So, initially, Dave had 11 + 3 = 14 items in his phone. Therefore, after deleting some items, he had 24 - 14 = 10 remaining items in his phone.
Response:  Jeff gave Nelly 136 cards out of 242 cards in total. So, the number of cards left with Nelly is: 242 - 136 = 106 cards.
Response:  At first, Jeff had 301 cards and then he gave 154 of them to Nelly. So, initially, Jeff had 301 + 154 = 455 cards. Therefore, the number of cards that Nelly has now is 455 - 154 = 301 cards.
Response:  Nelly had 528 cards and Jeff had 11 cards. If we give 252 cards to Jeff, then Nelly will have 276 cards left (528 - 252 = 276). So, Nelly gave Jeff 44 cards (276 - 11 = 44).
Response:  Nelly had 566 cards and Jeff had 234 cards initially. When Jeff got some of Nelly's cards, he now has 535 cards left. So, Jeff currently has 21 (535 - 234) cards.
"Response:  Nelly had 309 baseball cards and gave 10 of them to Jeff. Now there are 415 baseball cards left with Nelly. To find out how many more baseball cards Nelly has than Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards Jeff has from the total number of cards left with Nelly. So, the answer is:

Number of baseball cards Nelly has - Number of baseball cards Jeff has = 415 - 10 = 405
Therefore, Nelly has 405 more baseball cards than Jeff."
Response:  Nelly had 246 baseball cards and Jeff gave her 10 more cards. So, now Nelly has 346 cards in total (246 + 10 = 356). Since Jeff only gave her 10 cards that are not baseball cards, we can conclude that Nelly still has 404 baseball cards left (356 - 10 = 404). Therefore, there are 7 more baseball cards than non-baseball cards in Nelly's collection (404 - 356 = 7).
Response:  Nelly had 573 cards in total and gave 195 to John and 115 to Jeff. So, she has 263 cards left. Now, she wants to give some cards to Jeff. If she gives him more than she already did, then she will have less cards left. Therefore, the number of cards she can give to Jeff is less than or equal to 263 - 115 = 148.
Response:  Initially, Jeff had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card sets, so he had in total 438 + 18 x 10 = 464 cards. Then, Nelly gave him 55 ten-card sets, which means she gave him 55 x 10 = 550 additional cards. Finally, there are 178 baseball cards left, so the difference between the number of baseball cards Nelly gave Jeff and the initial number of baseball cards is: 550 - 178 = 372 baseball cards. Therefore, Nelly has 372 more baseball cards than Jeff.
Response:  Nelly had 239 baseball cards and Jeff gave her 376 ten-card sets. So, the total number of cards Nelly has now is: 239 + (376 x 10) = 3760. Since there are 111 baseball cards left with Jeff, we can deduce that the number of non-baseball card cards Nelly has is: 3760 - 111 = 3649. Therefore, the number of more non-baseball cards Nelly has than Jeff is: 3649 - 111 = 3538.
Response:  At first, Paco ate 3 cookies (since he ate 19 cookies in total). So, after eating 3 cookies, he had 16 cookies left (35 - 3 = 16). Therefore, the number of cookies Paco ate at first is 3.
Response:  If Pako ate 28 cookies and he left 7 cookies, then he must have eaten 21 cookies initially (28 - 7 = 21). Therefore, Pako ate 21 cookies in total.
Response:  First, Paco ate 40 cookies. Then he ate 2 more. So, he had eaten a total of 42 cookies. Finally, 37 more cookies were added to the pile, leaving Paco with how many cookies? Therefore, the answer is 79 cookies.
Response:  First, Paco ate 25 cookies. Then he ate 5 more, so he has eaten a total of 25 + 5 = 30 cookies. Finally, he ate 3 more, so he has eaten a total of 30 + 3 = 33 cookies. Therefore, Paco has eaten 33 cookies in total.
Response:  First, Paco ate 13 cookies. Then he ate 2 more. So, he had eaten a total of 15 cookies (13 + 2). Now, he has eaten 36 more cookies, so the total number of cookies he has eaten is 51 (15 + 36). Therefore, the answer is 51.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco ate 40 cookies and gave away 13 of them to his friend. So, he had 40 - 13 = 27 cookies left. Therefore, there are 27 cookies left for Paco.
Response:  Firstly, Paco ate 17 cookies and then gave away 13 of them to his friend. So, he had 14 cookies left with him. Now, we need to find out how many more cookies Paco's friend ate than what Paco had left with him. To do this, we can subtract the number of cookies Paco gave away from the total number of cookies he had after eating them. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco had after giving them away and the number of cookies he initially had is equal to the number of cookies his friend ate. In other words, the answer is: 14 - 13 = 1.So, Paco's friend ate one more cookie than Paco had left with him.
Response:  Firstly, Paco ate 12 cookies and gave his friend 21 cookies. So, there are 9 (21 - 12) more cookies that Paco's friend has than Paco does. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  If Pako ate 22 sweet cookies and then 15 more sweet cookies, he ate a total of 37 sweet cookies (22 + 15 = 37). Similarly, if he ate 75 salted cookies and then 54 more salted cookies, he ate a total of 129 salted cookies (75 + 54 = 129). Therefore, Pako left behind 96 cookies in total (37 sweet cookies - 96 salted cookies = 0).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco ate 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. So, he had a total of 15 cookies (9 sweet + 6 salty). Then, he ate another 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies Paco left with is: 15 + 3 = 18 cookies.  So, the answer is 18.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pakco ate 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies in total. Then, he ate 5 more sweet cookies after that. Therefore, the number of sweet cookies Pakco ate is: 37 + 5 = 42. On the other hand, we know that he ate 2 fewer salty cookies after eating 5 more sweet cookies. So, the number of salty cookies Pakco ate is: 11 - 2 = 9. Now, we want to find out how many more sweet cookies Pakco ate than salty cookies. To do this, we simply subtract the number of salty cookies from the number of sweet cookies: 42 - 9 = 33. Therefore, Pakco ate 33 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  If he had eaten 8 sweet cookies and then 6 salty cookies, that means he had a total of 14 cookies (8 + 6 = 14).  Then, if he had eaten 20 more sweet cookies, that would be an additional 20 cookies (14 + 20 = 34). So, the difference between the number of sweet cookies he ate initially and the number of salty cookies he ate is 34 - 14 = 20. Therefore, he ate 20 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  If Pako had initially 37 cookies and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 cookie left. So, Pako left 1 cookie behind.
Response:  Firstly, Paco ate 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So, he had 22 cookies left (36 - 14 = 22).
Response:  Firstly, Paco ate 41 cookies and gave 9 each to his friends. So, he had 32 cookies left (41 - 9 x 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 more cookies and gave 9 each to his friends again. Now, he has 10 cookies left (32 - 9 x 9 = 10). Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco ate after giving them away and the number of cookies he gave away is 22 (18 - 9 x 9 = 22).
Response:  Firstly, Paco ate 6 cookies and gave 30 to his friend. So, he had 30 - 6 = 24 cookies left. Then, his friend ate 23 cookies. Therefore, Paco gave his friend more cookies than he ate himself. The difference between the number of cookies Paco gave and the number of cookies he ate is 30 - 24 = 6 cookies.  Hence, the answer is 6 cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 97 salted cookies and 34 sweet cookies. Then, he ate 15 more sweet cookies and 56 more salted cookies. So, in total, Paco ate 97 + 15 = 112 sweet cookies and 34 + 56 = 80 salted cookies. Therefore, Paco left behind 112 - 34 = 78 sweet cookies and 80 - 34 = 46 salted cookies.
Response:  If Pako ate 26 salty cookies and then ate 14 more salty cookies, he would have eaten a total of 26 + 14 = 40 salty cookies. Similarly, if he ate 17 sweet cookies and then ate 9 more sweet cookies, he would have eaten a total of 17 + 9 = 26 sweet cookies. Therefore, Pako left behind 40 - 26 = 14 salty cookies.
Response:  If he had eaten 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies initially, then he had a total of 39 + 6 = 45 cookies.  Then, if he ate 23 more salty cookies, he would have a total of 45 + 23 = 68 cookies.  Finally, if he ate 32 more sweet cookies, he would have a total of 68 + 32 = 100 cookies. Therefore, he ate 32 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  If he had eaten 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies initially, then he had a total of 65 cookies (40 + 25).  Now, if he ate 28 more salty cookies, he would have a total of 93 cookies (65 + 28). Therefore, the difference between the number of salty cookies he ate after eating both types of cookies is 93 - 65 = 28.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $7 as her birthday gift. Then, she spent $2 of it, so she has $5 left ($7 - $2 = $5). Therefore, Gwen spent $5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $8$ dollars were spent as a gift for Gwen's birthday. Then, we are told that $6$ dollars remained after the gift was given. So, if $8$ dollars were spent, then $2$ dollars ($8 - 6 = 2$) remained. Therefore, Gwen received $2$ dollars as her birthday gift.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 more from her dad, so she got a total of $6.  Now, if they had given her $3 instead of $4, then she would have received a total of $9. Therefore, Gwen had $9 in total.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 more from her father, so she received a total of $13 ($8 + $5).  Now, let's compare this amount to the amount her father gave her mother, which is $4. So, the difference between the amount Gwen received from her parents is $9 ($13 - $4)."
"Response: 
Gwen received $3 from her mom and $4 from her dad. So, in total, Gwen received $7 ($3 + $4).  Therefore, Gwen's parents gave her more money than she got from her mom."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 more from her mother. So, in total, she received $12 from both of them. Now, we are asked how much more money Gwen's mother gave her than what Gwen's father gave her. To find this difference, we need to subtract the amount given by Gwen's father ($5) from the total amount received from both parents ($12). Therefore, the difference is $7 (i.e., $12 - $5).  Hence, the answer is $7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $3 more from her mother, so she received a total of $8 ($5 + $3). Now, let's compare this amount to what her father gave her. Her father gave her $6 more than what her mother gave her, so her father gave her $6 + $8 = $14. Therefore, Gwen's father gave her $14 more than her mother did.
Response:  Josh had 9 marbles initially and lost some of them later. If he now has 4 marbles, that means he must have lost 5 marbles. So, the number of marbles Josh lost is 5.
Response:  Josh lost 7 marbles from his collection and then found 5 more. So he had 12 marbles in total. Now, if we subtract the number of marbles he lost (7) from the total number of marbles he had (12), we get 5. Therefore, there were 5 marbles left in Josh's collection after he found them again.
Response:  Josh had 19 beads to start with and lost 11 of them. So he has 8 beads left (19 - 11 = 8). Then, he found 5 new beads, so now he has 13 beads in total (8 + 5 = 13). Therefore, there are 13 beads in Josh's hand right now.
Response:  Josh had 4 balls and lost 16 balls, then he found 8 new balls. So, in total, Josh had 4 + 8 = 12 balls.  Therefore, more balls were lost than found.
Response:  Josh had 7 beads in his collection and lost 8 beads. So he has 7 - 8 = -1 bead left. Then, he found 10 new beads. So, he now has -1 + 10 = 9 beads in total. Therefore, he found more beads than he lost by 9 - (-1) = 10 beads.
Response:  Josh had 21 marbles initially and found 7 of them. So, he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left.
Response:  Josh had 20 marbles initially and gave 2 to Jack. Now he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 marbles and Jack gave him 5 more, so now Josh has 27 marbles in total. Then, Jack took away 3 marbles from Josh, leaving him with 24 marbles. Therefore, Josh currently has 24 marbles.
Response:  Josh lost 11 marbles and then he collected 19 more. So, initially he had 11 - 19 = -8 marbles. Since he now has marbles, we can conclude that he must have at least 8 marbles left with him. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  Josh had 22 marbles and found 13 of them. He lost 5 marbles, so he has 22 - 5 = 17 marbles left. Therefore, there are 17 marbles in total.
Response:  Josh had 15 marbles and found 9 of them. So he has 6 marbles left (15 - 9 = 6). Now, he lost 23 marbles. Therefore, he has a total of 6 + 23 = 29 marbles.
Response:  Josh had 3 marbles initially and found 6 containers. He lost 5 containers, so he has 3 + 6 = 9 marbles left. Therefore, he found more than 9 - 5 = 4 additional marbles.
Response:  According to the question, Marco's dad took him to pick strawberries and their weight was around 4 pounds (4 lb). Then we are told that Marco's strawberry was heavier than his father's strawberry. So, if Marco's strawberry weighed 19 pounds (19 lb), then his father's strawberry must have weighed less than 19 lb - 4 lb = 15 lb. Therefore, Marco's strawberry is 4 lb + 15 lb = 19 lb more heavy than his father's strawberry.
Response:  According to the passage, Marco's dad picked 35 pounds of strawberries and Marco picked 13 pounds. So, we can calculate the difference between their weights as follows:  Difference = 35 - 13 = 22 pounds. Therefore, Marco's father's strawberries were heavier than Marco's by 22 pounds.
Response:  According to the passage, Marco's father collected apples and their weight was around 20 pounds ( £ $ € ). Then we are told that Marco's apple was heavier than his father's apple, so Marco's apple must have been around 17 pounds ( £ $ € ) more than his father's apple. Therefore, if Marco's apple was 19 pounds ( £ $ € ), then his father's apple would be 17 pounds ( £ $ € ). So, there were 3 pounds ( £ $ € ) of difference between Marco's and his father's apple weights.
Response:  Marcos dad went to pick strawberries and his strawberry weighed 8 pounds, while his father's strawberry weighed 32 pounds. So, the weight of Marcos' strawberry is 8/4 = 2 pounds.
Response:  Marcos dad and he collected 24 pounds of strawberries together. On their way back, Marcos lost 9 pounds of strawberries. So, Marcos now has 3 pounds of strawberries left. To find out how much weight his father's strawberries have, we need to subtract the weight of Marcos' strawberries from the total weight they collected together. Therefore, Marcos' father's strawberries weigh 21 pounds (24 - 9 = 21).
Response:  The father and Marco collected 36 pounds of strawberries together. When they returned home, Marco's father gave him 2 pounds less than he had earlier. So, how many pounds of strawberries does Marco have now?  We can calculate it as follows:  Initial weight = 36 pounds (from the question) Less amount given by father = 2 pounds (mentioned in the question) New weight = Initial weight - Amount given by father = 36 pounds - 2 pounds = 34 pounds Therefore, Marco has 34 pounds of strawberries now.
Response:  The father and daughter went to pick strawberries together and collected 22 pounds of strawberries. On their way back home, the father found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries belonging to Marco. So, now Marco's total weight of strawberries is 36 pounds. As for the father's strawberries, there are probably several more pounds than that since he found them on his way back home.
"Response:  If Marco's dad took 15 pounds of strawberries to market and they sold for $37 per pound, then...

Answer:  If Marco's dad took 15 pounds of strawberries to market and they sold for $37 per pound, then the total amount of money he made from selling those strawberries is:

$37 x 15 = $525

So, Marco's father made $525 from selling his strawberries at the market."
"Response:  If Marco's dad bought 30 pounds of strawberries and each pound costs $17, then...

Answer:  If Marco's dad bought 30 pounds of strawberries and each pound costs $17, then the total cost of his strawberries is $30 x $17 = $490. So, if they all weighed 17 pounds, Marco's strawberries would be heavier than his father's by $490 - $17 = $473 pounds."
"Response:  If Marco's dad bought 10 pounds of strawberries and each pound costs $2.60, then...

Answer:  If Marco's dad bought 10 pounds of strawberries and each pound costs $2.60, then the total cost of his strawberries is $26 ($2.60 x 10). Now, if they have a total of 26 pounds of strawberries among them (Marco and his dad), and Marco's dad has 10 pounds, then Marco has 16 pounds of strawberries ($26 - $2.60 x 10 = $13.40 / 16 = $0.85 per pound). So, Marco's dad's strawberries are heavier than Marco's by $0.85 per pound."
Response:  If Marco's dad bought 11 pounds of strawberries and they cost $30, then we can calculate how many strawberries Marco's dad bought by dividing the weight of the strawberries by the price per pound. So, 11 pounds / $30 = 0.37 pounds (or approximately 0.4 pounds). Therefore, Marco's dad bought around 0.4 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 children in the bus.  Then, more children got on the bus at the bus stop, making the total number of children in the bus 8. So, the difference between the initial number and the final number is 8 - 2 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more children in the bus than there were initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 26 children boarded the bus initially. Then, 38 children got on the bus at the bus stop. So, the total number of children who are currently on the bus is: 26 + 38 = 64 children. Therefore, there are 64 children currently on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 3 children who got off the bus at the bus stop. Then, 2 more children boarded the bus at the same stop. So, initially, there were 3 + 2 = 5 children in the bus. Later, 40 other children boarded the bus at different stops. Therefore, finally, there were 5 + 40 = 45 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that there were 43 children in total who boarded the bus.  At the bus stop, 21 children got off the bus, leaving 22 children still on the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is 21.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children on the bus. Then, 18 children got off the bus, leaving 23 children still on the bus. So, before the bus arrived at the terminal, there were more than 23 children on the bus compared to the number of children who got off. Therefore, the answer is 23 + x, where x is the initial number of children on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off at the bus stop and 5 other children got on the bus. So, the number of children in the bus after this process is: 21 - 10 + 5 = 16 children. Therefore, 16 children got on or off the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 5 children in the bus. Then, 63 children got off at the bus stop and 20 more children boarded the bus, so the total number of children in the bus now is 85 (5 + 63 - 20). Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who boarded the bus is 78 (85 - 63).
Response:  At first, there were 36 children in the bus. Then, 68 children got off at the bus stop and 12 children got on the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus afterward was 12 + 68 = 80 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on is 80 - 36 = 44 children.
Response:  Initially, there were 22 children in the bus. Then, 40 children got off at the bus stop, leaving 8 children inside the bus. Finally, there were 2 children left inside the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 40 - 8 = 32.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 28 children in the bus. Then, at the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus and some of them got off. So, the total number of children in the bus after they got on was 30 + 82 = 112 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 112 - 82 = 30 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 23 children in the bus. Then, at the bus stop, 24 children boarded the bus, and some of them got off. So, the total number of children in the bus at one time was 8 (as mentioned in the question). Now, to find out how many more children got off than boarded, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who boarded: 24 - 23 = 1 Therefore, there were 1 more child who got off the bus than boarded it.
Response:  If Baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then he must have had 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). So, if he sold 51 cakes, he must have had twice as many left over (82 / 2 = 41). Therefore, Baker made more than 41 additional cakes beyond what he sold.
Response:  If Baker made 54 cakes and sold some of them, then he had x cakes left after selling some. Since he had 13 cakes left, we can write an equation: x = 54 - 13. Therefore, Baker sold 41 cakes (x).
Response:  If Baker made 145 cakes and sold them all, then he must have made $X$ cakes initially. Since 72 cakes are left, we can find out how many cakes Baker made by dividing $X$ by 72: $$ \frac{X}{72} = 145 $$ Now, let's solve for $X$. We know that $X$ is the number of cakes Baker made initially, so we can write: $$ X = 72 \times \frac{145}{72} = 100 $$ Therefore, Baker made $100$ cakes initially.
Response:  If Baker made 155 pieces of cake and his friend took 140 pieces away from him, then Baker has 15 - 14 = 1 piece of cake left.
Response:  The baker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) cakes left. Then, he bought 170 new cakes, so now he has 16 + 170 = 186 cakes in total.
"Response:  The baker made 13 cakes and sold them for $91. Then he bought 154 new cakes. So, the total number of cakes the baker had after buying the new ones is:

$91 + 154 = $245

Therefore, there are $245 - $13 = $232 more cakes than the baker sold."
Response:  The baker made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them. So, he had 92 remaining (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he gave away 31 of those remaining cakes to his friends. Now, he has 61 remaining (92 - 31 = 61). Therefore, there are 31 more cakes that the baker gave away than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 110 cakes and sold 75 of them, so he has 35 remaining (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made another 76 cakes, bringing his total number of cakes to 42 (35 + 76 = 42). Therefore, the baker currently has 42 cakes in stock.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them. So, he had 73 remaining cakes (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made additional 111 cakes and sold them all (111 / 0 = 111). Therefore, the total number of cakes the baker sold is: 73 + 111 = 184 cakes.  Hence, the difference between the number of cakes the baker sold and the number of cakes he had left after selling the first batch is: 184 - 73 = 111 cakes.
Response:  If Baker made 149 cakes and sold 10 of them, he has 139 cakes left (149 - 10 = 139).  Similarly, if he sold 90 pastries and had 91 remaining, he has 21 pastries left (91 - 90 = 21).  So, Baker has 139 + 21 = 160 cakes and pastries left.
Response:  If Baker made 7 cakes and sold them for $15 each, he gained $105 ($15 x 7).  Now, if he had made 15 more cakes and sold them for $10 each, he would have gained an additional $150 ($10 x 15).  Therefore, in total, Baker has gained $255 from selling both sets of cakes and pastries combined.
Response:  If Baker made 126 cakes and sold 115 of them, then he has 11 left over that he did not sell. Similarly, if he made 48 pastries and sold 81 of them, then he has 37 left over that he did not sell. So, the number of cakes Baker made that he did not sell is equal to the number of pastries he made that he did not sell, which is 11 - 37 = -26. Therefore, Baker made more cakes than pastries.
Response:  If Baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries, then he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of pastries he made, we get: Number of pastries Baker made - Pastries sold = 131 - 70 = 61 pastries. Therefore, there are 61 more pastries than cakes that Baker made.
Response:  If the baker sold 157 cakes and 169 pastries at $2 each, then the total revenue from both items would be: Revenue = Number of cakes x Price per cake + Number of pastries x Price per pastry = 157 x $2 + 169 x $2 = $316 So, if the baker sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries, the difference in revenue between the two scenarios is: Difference = New revenue - Old revenue = $316 - $305 = $11 The baker made $11 more in revenue from selling cakes than they did from selling pastries.
Response:  The baker made 54 cakes and sold 68 of them, so he has 54 - 68 = -14 left. He also made 143 pastries and sold 92 of them, so he has 143 - 92 = 51 left. Therefore, the baker sold more pastries than cakes.
Response:  If Baker had sold 44 cakes and made 48 cakes if he had more ingredients, then we can calculate how many cakes are left as follows: Number of cakes remaining = Total number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 48 - 44 = 4 So, there are 4 cakes left.
Response:  If Baker had initially made 40 cakes and sold 8 of them, then he has 40 - 8 = 32 remaining cakes left. So, if he had initially made more than 8 cakes, then he must have made at least 32 + 1 = 33 cakes in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes he made and the number he sold is 33 - 8 = 25 cakes.
Response:  If he had made 169 cakes initially and gave away 137 of them, then how many are left? To find out, we need to subtract the number given away from the total number of cakes made: 169 - 137 = 32 So there are 32 cakes left.
Response:  Baeker made 173 cakes and sold 86 of them. So he has 87 remaining (173 - 86 = 87).  Therefore, Baeker has 87 cakes left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker made 99 cakes initially and then he added 167 new cakes to it, making the total number of cakes he had 266 (99 + 167). Now, out of these 266 cakes, Baker sold 89 cakes. So, the remaining cakes with him are 177 (266 - 89). Therefore, there were 30 more cakes than what Baker sold.
Response:  If Baker made 8 cakes and sold them for $139, then he earned total revenue of $139.  If he also made 145 additional cakes and sold them for $145, then his total revenue from both batches is $284 ($139 + $145). So, there were 6 more cakes sold than made (i.e., $284 - $278 = 6). Therefore, there were 6 more cakes sold than made.
Response:  The baker made 62 cakes and then made another 149 cakes, for a total of 211 cakes. He sold 144 of them, so the number of cakes the baker has left is 211 - 144 = 67 cakes. Therefore, the baker has 67 cakes in total.
Response:  The baker made 81 cakes and then made another 92 cakes, for a total of 173 cakes. He sold 46 of them. So, to find out how many more cakes the baker made than he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made: 173 - 46 = 127. Therefore, the baker made 127 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  If Baker made 108 cakes and sold them all, he would have 108 - 44 = 64 remaining cakes.  Therefore, Baker has 64 cakes left.
Response:  The baker made 56 pieces of bread and sold 104 pieces of cake. So, he has 56 - 104 = 48 pieces of bread left.
Response:  If Baker made 52 pies and sold them for $3 each, then he earned $166 from pie sales.  If he also made 84 cakes and sold them for $4 each, then he earned $336 from cake sales.  Total earnings = $166 + $336 = $502.  So, if Baker sold 102 cakes and 94 pies, his total earnings would be $502 x 1.94 = $976.
Response:  If Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes, then he sold 134 + 11 = 145 items in total.  If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries, then he had 140 - 134 = 6 more cakes than pastries. Therefore, there are 6 more pastries than cakes. So, the number of pastries is 145 - 6 = 139.
Response:  If the baker sold 14 cakes and 153 pastries, then he sold a total of 167 items (14 cakes + 153 pastries).  If he sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes, then he sold a total of 105 items (8 pastries + 97 cakes). So, the difference between the number of cakes and pastries sold is 62 (167 - 105). Therefore, the baker sold 62 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  If the baker sold 43 cakes and 114 pastries, then the total number of items sold is 43 + 114 = 157.  If he also sold 78 cakes, then the total number of cakes sold is 43 + 78 = 121. Therefore, the baker sold 121 - 114 = 7 more pastries than cakes.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and wants to have 140 games in total, she needs additional 118 games.
Response:  Kelsi has 106 games and gives up 64 of them. So she has 42 remaining games.
Response:  If Kelly gave Nintendo games as gifts and she gave 91 of them, then there are 92 - 91 = 1 remaining game that she did not give. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  Kelsi has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. If she wants to sell 12 Nintendo games, how many will be left after selling them? So, the answer is 48 (20 - 12 = 48).
Response:  Kelii has 46 Nintendo games and wants to reduce it to 31 Sony games. To do this, he needs to give up how many Sony games? Solution: We can start by subtracting the number of Sony games Kelii already has (46) from the total number of Sony games he wants to have (31). So, Kelii needs to give up 15 Sony games to reach his goal.
"Response:  Kelsi has 80 Nintendo games and she found 31 more. To find out how many games she needs to give up to have 6 left, we need to subtract the number of new games from the total number of games she has. So, the answer is:

80 - 31 = 49

Kelsi needs to give up 49 games to have 6 left."
Response:  Randi started building the tower with 52 blocks and used 38 of them to complete it. So, initially, he had 14 blocks left (52 - 38 = 14).
Response:  Randi has $ 97$ blocks and he wants to build a tower with them. He uses $ 72 $ blocks to build the base of the tower and then he has $ 25 $ blocks left. So, he can use at most $ 25 $ blocks to build the top of the tower. Therefore, the maximum number of blocks that Randi can use to build the top of the tower is $ 25 $.
Response:  Randi has 79 blocks and he uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, how many blocks are left after building these structures? We can count the number of blocks used for each structure and subtract it from the total number of blocks Randi had: Tower: 14 blocks House: 11 blocks Total blocks used = 14 + 11 = 25 blocks Left over = 79 - 25 = 54 blocks
Response:  Randi uses 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. So far, he has used a total of 27 + 53 = 80 blocks. Therefore, Randi has used 80 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randi uses 37 blocks to build the tower and 33 blocks to build the house. So he used a total of 60 blocks (37 + 33). Now we need to find out how many more blocks he used for building the tower than for building the house. We can do this by subtracting the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower: 60 - 33 = 27. Therefore, Randi used 27 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  Randi uses 86 blocks to build both the tower and the house. If he used 79 blocks to build the tower, then he had 7 (86 - 79) extra blocks left over that he could use to build the house. Therefore, Randi needed 13 more blocks than he used for the tower to build the house.
Response:  Randi uses 36 blocks to build a tower. If there are 59 blocks in total, then Randi has used 36 / 59 = 0.61 blocks so far. Therefore, there are 59 - 0.61 = 58.49 blocks left unused.
Response:  Randi has $ 95$ blocks to build his house and he uses $ 20$ blocks for the foundation and $ 50$ blocks for the tower. So, the number of blocks left for building the house is $ 95 - (20 + 50) = 25$ blocks. Therefore, Randi used $ 25$ more blocks than he had initially to build the tower.
"Response:  Randi used 89 blocks to build his house and 63 blocks to build his tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for the tower than for the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used for both structures:

Number of blocks used for tower = Total number of blocks used - Number of blocks used for house
= 142 - 89
= 53

Therefore, Randi used 53 more blocks to build his tower than he did for his house."
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and the person has not read any of them yet, then they have not read any books from the series. Therefore, the answer is 0.
"Response:  According to the question, there are several books in the ""Wild Book School"" series that have been read (13 books) and some that haven't been read yet (8 books). So, the total number of books in the series is: 13 + 8 = 21 books."
"Response:  If we have read 12 books in the series and watched 56 movies, then we can calculate how many more books to read as follows:

Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read
= 22 - 12
= 10

So, if we want to know how many more books to read after watching 56 movies, the answer is 10 more books."
"Response:  If we have read 19 books and watched 7 movies in the ""Wild Romance"" series, then we can infer that there are 19 + 7 = 26 different pieces of media in this series. Therefore, to find out how many movies we would need to watch to see all of them, we simply divide the total number of pieces of media (26) by the number of movies we have already watched (7): 26 / 7 = 3.71 movies per book. So, if we had read 19 books, we would need to watch approximately 3.71 x 19 = 68.59 movies in total to see all of the movies in the ""Wild Romance"" series."
"Response:  If we have read 19 books and watched 13 movies from the ""Stupid School"" series, then we can conclude that there are more books than movies in the series. Specifically, there are 19 - 13 = 6 more books in the series than movies. Therefore, the answer is 6."
"Response:  If we read 19 books and watched 61 movies in the ""Stupid School"" series, then the number of movies is greater than the number of books by 42 (61 - 19 = 42). Therefore, there are 42 more movies in the ""Stupid School"" series than books."
Response:  If you have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, then you have spent 13 x 8 = 104 minutes reading books and 12 x 90 = 1080 minutes watching movies. Therefore, you have spent more time reading books than watching movies (104 minutes vs 1080 minutes). So, the difference between the number of books you read and the number of movies you watched is 104 - 1080 = -976 minutes.
"Response:  If you have read book 7 volumes or more and watched movie 21 volumes or more, then we can calculate the difference as follows:

Books: 7 + 8 + 9 +... + x = 11 (total number of books)
Movies: 21 + 22 + 23 +... + y = 17 (total number of movies)

Now, let's find out how many more movies there are than books:
y - x = 17 - 11 = 6

So, if you have read 7 volumes or more of books and watched 21 volumes or more of movies, there are 6 more movies than books."
"Response:  If we have read 8 books in the ""Wild Boy of the Blue Ridge"" series and there are total 14 books in the series, then we still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6). Therefore, we need to read 6 more books in the series."
"Response:  If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies from the series ""The Crazy Fool School"", then we can calculate how many books you would need to read if you want to watch all 62 movies in the series as follows :

Number of movies left = Total number of movies - Number of movies watched
= 62 - 34
= 28

So, you would need to read 28 books to watch all 62 movies in the series."
Response:  If you read 7 books and watch 4 movies, then you have watched a total of 7 + 4 = 11 pieces of media. Therefore, to find out how many movies you would need to watch to see all 21 movies in the series, we can divide 21 by 11, which gives us approximately 1.90 movies per movie. So, you would need to watch approximately 1.90 movies to see all 21 movies in the series.
"Response:  If you read 11 books and watched 40 movies from the ""Stupid School"" series, there are 14 other movies and 15 other books in the series. So, if we subtract the number of movies and books that you have watched (40 + 15 = 55), then the remaining number of movies and books in the series would be:

Movies: 55 - 40 = 15
Books: 55 - 11 = 44
Therefore, there are 15 more movies and 44 more books in the ""Stupid School"" series than what you have watched."
"Response:  If you read 13 books and watched 63 movies from the ""Stupid School"" series, then the number of movies is greater than the number of books by 50 (63 - 13 = 50). Therefore, there are 50 more movies in the ""Stupid School"" series than books."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series. If we read 14 movies and 19 books, then we have read more books than movies. So, the difference between the number of books and movies is 19 - 10 = 9. Therefore, we have read 9 more books than movies.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series. If we read all 8 books, then we have read a total of 8 x 1 = 8 movies. Similarly, if we watch all 5 movies, then we have watched a total of 5 x 1 = 5 books. Therefore, if we read both books and watch both movies, we will have seen a total of 8 + 5 = 13 different media forms. So, if we read 19 pieces of media (books and movies combined), then we saw an average of 13 / 19 = 0.74 movie for each book we read.
Response:  Dave has already bought 3 tickets and still has 2 left. If he buys another toy, he will have 1 ticket left. So, in total, Dave bought 4 tickets (3 + 1 = 4).
Response:  Dave had 10 tickets and gave away 3 to his friend. Then he went to the game center and got 5 more tickets. So, Dave now has 12 tickets in total. If he still has 14 tickets after that, then he must have gotten 2 more tickets at the game center. Therefore, Dave got 2 additional tickets at the game center.
Response:  Dave has 18 tickets and he wants to divide them into 5 groups of 3 each. So, he will have 5 groups of 3 tickets each. Now, he has 11 shirts and he wants to distribute them among these 5 groups. Since there are 5 groups, each group will get 2 shirts (since 5 divided by 2 is 2). Therefore, Dave will have 2 extra shirts left over after distributing them among the groups.
Response:  If Dave has 19 tickets and he gives 7 to his friend, then Dave has 12 tickets left. Now, if Dave had 12 toys and gave 4 to his friend, then Dave has 8 toys left. So, in this case, Dave has more toys than tickets. Therefore, the answer is Yes, Dave has more toys than tickets.
Response:  If Dave had 13 tickets and gave away 8 for toys, he would have 5 left (13 - 8 = 5). Then, if he gave away 18 more tickets for clothes, he would have 0 left (5 - 18 = 0). So, Dave gave away a total of 26 tickets (8 + 18 = 26) for both toys and clothes. Therefore, the difference between the number of tickets Dave gave away for toys and clothes is 26 - 8 = 18.
Response:  Dave had 14 tickets and lost 2 of them. So he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. Since each ticket costs $10, Dave has 12 x $10 = $120 worth of toys left.
"Response:  We know that Haley planted 14 trees in her backyard after Typhoon No. 9 passed away. However, we don't know how many trees were left standing after the typhoon hit. So, let's assume there were x trees remaining before the storm. Since x + 14 = 28 (the total number of trees), we can solve for x as follows:
x = 14 - 28
x = -14
So, there were -14 trees remaining after Typhoon No. 9 hit. Therefore, the difference between the number of trees that survived and the number of trees that died is:
Difference = Number of trees that survived - Number of trees that died
= 14 - (-14)
= 28
Answer: There were 28 more trees that died than survived."
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees in her backyard after Typhoon No. 6 passed away. However, we are not told how many trees survived the typhoon and how many died. So, let's assume that there were x number of surviving trees before the typhoon hit. After the typhoon, 3 trees died, leaving us with x - 3 trees. Now, we know that Haley planted 13 new trees, so the total number of trees in her backyard now is x + 13. Therefore, the difference between the number of trees that survived the typhoon and the number of new trees planted is: x - 3 + 13 = 10. So, there were 10 more trees planted than survived the typhoon.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 20 trees in her backyard and after the storm, 4 trees remained. So, initially there were 20 - 4 = 16 trees. Now, we need to find out how many trees died due to the storm. Since 4 trees survived, we can conclude that 16 - 4 = 12 trees died. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  If Haley planted 10 trees before Typhoon 5 hit and 3 of them survived, then she has 7 remaining trees (10 - 3 = 7). Now, if 12 new trees are planted after the typhoon, then the total number of trees that Haley has is 7 + 12 = 19 trees. So, Haley has 19 trees in total.
Response:  Firstly, Harry planted 9 trees in his backyard before the storm hit. Then after the storm, he added another 5 trees. So, the total number of trees is 9 + 5 = 14 trees. Therefore, there are 14 trees left in Harry's backyard.
Response:  If she had planted 12 trees and 2 of them died after the typhoon, then there are 10 remaining trees. So, the answer is 10.
Response:  If she had planted 3 trees initially and 13 trees died due to the typhoon, then the number of trees that survived is 3 - 13 = -10. So, there were 10 more trees that died than survived.
Response:  If she had initially planted 11 trees and 2 of them survived the storm, then the total number of trees she had was 11 - 2 = 9. So, if 2 more trees died after the storm, the remaining trees would be 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, the difference between the number of trees that survived the storm and the initial number of trees is 7 - 2 = 5.
"Response:  If there are 28 oranges in one basket and they harvest 66 baskets per day, then...

Answer:  They can harvest ${{66 \div 28}} = 2.4$ baskets of oranges per hour."
Response:  If he harvests 8 baskets per day, then in one day he will have harvested 8 x 24 = 192 oranges. Therefore, it takes him 192 days to harvest all 24 baskets of oranges.
"Response:  If he picked oranges for 4 days and harvested 56 baskets per day, then...

Answer:  He harvested a total of 2240 baskets of oranges over those 4 days (56 x 4 = 224)."
"Response:  If he visited them for 49 days and they harvested 38 baskets per day, then...

Answer: $ \boxed{38 \times 49 = 1762} $

So, after 49 days of orange picking, they would have collected $\boxed{1762}$ oranges."
"Response:  If he went to see them for 87 days and they harvested 66 bags per day, then the total number of bags is:

66 x 87 = 5,632 bags

Now, each bag contains 25 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

5,632 x 25 = 140,700 oranges

Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, there are 140,700 oranges left."
Response:  If he went to see them and found that they were harvesting 8 baskets per day, and each basket contains 35 oranges... So, in one day, they will harvest 8 x 35 = 280 oranges.  Therefore, they harvest 280 oranges per day.
"Response:  If he harvests 16 oranges per day and each orange is contained in one of 80 baskets, then...

Answer:  To calculate how many days it takes to harvest 80 baskets of oranges, we need to divide the total number of oranges (80 x 57 = 4480) by the number of oranges harvested per day (16). So, it will take...

Answer:... approximately 280 days to harvest 80 baskets of oranges, assuming he harvests only during the time period when they are ripe for picking."
"Response:  If he saw that they harvested 67 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 12 oranges, then...

Answer: 35 baskets x 12 oranges/basket = 420 oranges

So, they harvested 420 oranges in total that day."
Response:  If he picked 74 oranges in one day and threw away 71 of them, then he has 3 oranges left.  Since there are 51 days in total, he will have 3 x 51 = 153 oranges after 51 days.
"Response:  If one bag contains 50 oranges and they harvest 76 bags per day, then...

Answer:  They can harvest $76 \times 50 = 3800$ oranges per day."
Response:  On day 1, he picked 28 baskets of oranges that were fully ripe and 52 baskets that were not yet ripe. So, in total, he had 80 baskets of oranges (28 + 52). Since there are 30 days in April, he collected 2400 oranges per day (80 / 30 = 2400). Therefore, after collecting oranges for 26 days, he would have collected a total of 67,200 oranges (2400 x 26 = 67,200).
Response:  On day 25, he harvested 82 pounds of oranges that were ripe and 61 pounds of unripe oranges. So, in total, he collected 143 pounds (82 + 61) of oranges per day.
"Response:  If he harvested 31 baskets of oranges that were fully ripe and 24 baskets of unripe oranges in one day, then...

Answer: In total, he harvested 55 baskets of oranges over a period of 45 days."
Response:  If he picked 44 bags of oranges that were fully ripe and 25 bags of unripe oranges in one day, then we can calculate the total number of oranges he picked as follows: Fully ripe oranges = 44 x 10 (since there are 10 oranges in each bag) = 440 Unripe oranges = 25 x 10 = 250 Total oranges = 440 + 250 = 690 Oranges per day So, he picked more than 690 oranges per day.
"Response:  If he picked 5 baskets of oranges that were fully ripe and 74 baskets that were not yet ripe, then...

Answer: The number of baskets of fully ripe oranges is 5, and the number of baskets of unripe oranges is 74. To find out how many more baskets of ripe oranges there are than unripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges:

5 (baskets of ripe oranges) - 74 (baskets of unripe oranges) = 69

So, there are 69 more baskets of ripe oranges than unripe oranges."
"Response:  If he picked 54 oranges in one day, and there are 18 oranges in each bag, then...

Answer: He picked 3 bags of oranges per day."
"Response:  If they harvested 56 baskets of oranges in one day and it took them 14 days to harvest that many, then we can calculate the number of baskets per day as follows:

Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days taken to harvest
= 56 / 14
= 4 baskets per day
Therefore, they harvested 4 baskets of oranges per day during those 14 days."
Response:  We know that he discovered 25 baskets of immature oranges and 5 baskets of mature oranges per day.  Therefore, we can calculate the total number of baskets of oranges harvested over 73 days as follows: Total number of baskets = Number of baskets per day x Number of days So, the total number of baskets of oranges harvested over 73 days is: Total number of baskets = 25 + 5 = 30 baskets per day x 73 days = 2,250 baskets Overall, there are approximately 2,250 baskets of oranges left after 73 days of harvesting.
Response:  If he picked 65 bags of oranges that were not yet ripe and each bag contains 46 oranges, then he has collected a total of... (calculate)...oranges.  After 6 days, if each orange ripens into 2 oranges, then he will have collected... (calculate)...new oranges. Therefore, after 6 days, he can fill... (calculate)...bags with new oranges.
Response:  If he picked 41 bags of immature oranges and 86 bags of mature oranges in one day, then we can calculate the total number of oranges he collected as follows: Total number of oranges = Number of immature oranges x Weight of an immature orange + Number of mature oranges x Weight of a mature orange The weight of an immature orange is given to be 0.5 kg, and the weight of a mature orange is given to be 1.2 kg. So, if we substitute these values into the formula above, we get: Total number of oranges = (41 x 0.5) + (86 x 1.2) = 20.6 + 103.2 = 123.8 kilograms In this case, the person collected more than 123.8 kilograms of oranges in one day. Therefore, the answer is (D) More than 123.8 kilograms.
"Response:  If he picked 71 baskets of immature oranges and 60 baskets of mature ones in one day, then...

Answer:  The number of mature oranges he picked in one day is 60 baskets."
"Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer Jesse's room is than Sarah's room, we need to subtract their dimensions. So, the length of Sarah's room is:

Length of Sarah's room = Length of Jesse's room - Width of Jesse's room
= 12 ft - 11 ft
= 1 ft

Therefore, Sarah's room is 1 foot shorter than Jesse's room in terms of length."
"Response:  If Jesse's room is 7 feet long and she needs a carpet that is 14 square feet in size, we can calculate the width of her room as follows:

Width = Length x Area Required / Total Area
= 7 ft x 14 sq ft / (7 ft x 10 ft)
= 28 inches
Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 28 inches or 2.36 feet."
"Response:  If Ji-seo's room is 7 feet wide and she needs a 14 square foot carpet, we can calculate the length of her room as follows:

Length = Width x Area of Carpet / Square Footage of Room
= 7 x 14 / 100 (since 1 square foot is equal to 100 square inches)
= 98 inches

Therefore, the length of Ji-seo's room is approximately 98 inches or 8.26 feet."
Response:  Firstly, we know that  $ \text{Je-shi}'s room is 3 meters long and 5 meters wide. $\ Therefore, the area of the floor can be calculated as follows: $$ \text{Area of floor} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ square meters} $$ Now, we are given that $ \text{Jeshi} $ already has 16 square feet of carpet. Since there are $ 16 \div 0.09 = 177.78 $ square feet in one square meter, we can calculate the total amount of carpet Jeshi needs to cover the entire floor as follows: $$ \text{Total amount of carpet needed} = \text{Area of floor} - \text{Amount of carpet already owned} = 15 \text{ square meters} - 177.78 \text{ square feet} = 162.78 \text{ square feet} $$ Therefo...
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many tiles are needed to cover the length of the room. Since the length is 2 feet and each tile covers an area of $4 \text{ ft}^2$, we can calculate the number of tiles as follows: $\text {Number of tiles} = \text{Length of the room } / \text{Area of each tile}$ $\text{= }$ $2\text{ ft} / $ $4\text{ ft}^2$ $\text{= }$ $50\%$ $\text{of }$ $2\text{ ft}$ $\text{= }$ $1 \text{ tile}$ Therefore, one tile will be enough to cover the entire length of the room. Now, let's move on to finding out how many tiles are needed to cover the width of the room. The width is $12\text{ ft}$, and each tile covers an area of $4\text{ ft}^2$. To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the width, we can use the same formula as before: $\text{Number of tiles} = \text{Width of the room } / \text{Area of each tile}$ $\text{= }$ $12\text{ ft} / $ $4\text{ ft}^2$ $\text{= }$ $3 \text{ tiles}$ Therefore, three tiles will be needed to cover the entire width of the room. So, in total, we need $1 + 3 = 4$ tiles to cover the entire floor of the room.
Response:  Since the length and width of each room are both 6 meters, we can assume that the total area of all rooms is 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Now, to cover the entire floor with carpeting, we need to calculate how much carpeting is needed for each room. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we can divide the total area of the floors by the area of one room to find out how many pieces of carpeting we need: 36 / 6 = 6 pieces of carpeting. Therefore, we will need 6 pieces of carpeting to cover the entire floor.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Je-shi's room is 6 meters wide and 6 meters long. So, its area is 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Now, we are asked how much longer Je-shi's room is than her neighbor's room. We can assume that Je-shi's neighbor has a room with an area of x square meters. Therefore, the difference in length between their rooms is 36 - x square meters.
Response:  Since the length of the room is 1.5 feet, we can find out how wide it is as follows:  Width = Length x Height / Area To do this, we need to know the area of the room in square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = Length x Width So, if the length of the room is 1.5 feet and the width is x feet, then the area of the room is: Area = 1.5 x x feet Now, we are given that 10 square feet of carpeting is needed to cover the floor of the room. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 10 = Area / Length x Width Substituting the value of Area from above, we get: 10 = (1.5 x x) / 1.5 So, simplifying, we have: 10 = x / 1.5 Now, dividing both sides by x gives us the final answer: x = 6.67 feet In other words, the width of the room is approximately 6.67 feet.
"Response:  If the width of the room is 2 feet and we need to cover it with a carpet that is 10 square feet in size, then we can calculate the length of the room as follows:

Length = Width x Area of Carpet / Size of Room
= 2 x 10 / 10 (since the area of the carpet is 10 square feet)
= 20 feet
Therefore, the length of the room is 20 feet."
Response:  If the room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, then its area is: Area = Length x Width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 80 sq ft Now, we know that the carpet covers 18 square feet. So, to find out how much more space the carpet will cover, we need to subtract the area of the room from the total area of the carpet: Total area of the carpet - Room area = 18 sq ft - 80 sq ft = -64 sq ft Therefore, the carpet will not be able to cover the entire floor of the room.
Response:  The laser back shop sold $23 worth of t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. If they sold t-shirts for $23 each, then they sold 23 / $23 = 1 t-shirt. Therefore, they sold one t-shirt.
Response:  We know that the laser back shop sold three t-shirts and earned $51 dollars from those sales. To find out how much one t-shirt costs, we can divide the total amount of money they earned by the number of t-shirts they sold: $51 / 3 = $17 per t-shirt. Therefore, one t-shirt costs $17.
Response:  The store sold $87 worth of t-shirts during both games combined. In Arkansas game, they sold 47 t-shirts and in Texas Tech game, they sold 58 t-shirts. So, total number of t-shirts sold is 47 + 58 = 105 t-shirts. Therefore, the store made $87 x 105 = $9,025 in profit from selling t-shirts during these two games.
Response:  In the Arkansas game, they sold $115 worth of t-shirts and in the Texas Tech game, they sold $242 worth of t-shirts. So, if we subtract the amount of t-shirts sold in the Arkansas game from the total amount of t-shirts sold during both games, we get...$242 - $115 = $127. Therefore, they sold $127 worth of t-shirts in the Texas Tech game.
Response:  The store sold $98 in t-shirts during both games combined. In the Arkansas game, they sold 89 t-shirts, and in the Texas Tech game, they sold 74 t-shirts. So, if we subtract the number of t-shirts sold in the Arkansas game from the total amount of money earned, we get: $98 - 89 = $9. If we then divide this amount by the number of t-shirts sold in the Arkansas game, we get: $9 / 89 = $0.105 or approximately $0.11 per t-shirt. Therefore, the store made approximately $0.11 per t-shirt in profit during the Arkansas game.
"Response:  If they sold $78 worth of t-shirts at the Arkansas game and $186 worth of t-shirts at the Texas Tech game, then... See full solution

Answer:  They made $104 more in sales at the Texas Tech game than they did at the Arkansas game."
"Response:  The store sold $62 per t-shirt and $99 per uniform. Since they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 uniforms, their total revenue from these items is:

Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of uniforms x Price per uniform
= 183 x $62 + 31 x $99
= $11,573 + $2,999
= $14,572
Therefore, the store made $14,572 in revenue from selling t-shirts and uniforms during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  The store sold $67 for each t-shirt and $165 for each major league baseball jersey. Since they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 baseball jerseys during the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Angels game, we can calculate the total amount of money made as follows: Total revenue from t-shirts = 74 x $67 = $4,898 Total revenue from baseball jerseys = 156 x $165 = $25,340 Total revenue = $4,898 + $25,340 = $30,238 Therefore, the store made a total of $30,238 in revenue during that particular event.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one t-shirt is $192 and the price of one uniform is $34.  Therefore, if they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 uniforms during the Texas Tech game, their total revenue would be:

Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price of t-shirt + Number of uniforms x Price of uniform
= 157 x $192 + 19 x $34
= $28,606 + $656
= $29,262

So, the t-shirts are more expensive than the uniforms by $29,262 - $656 = $28,606."
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts and uniforms is $254 + $43 = $297. So, there are more than $297 - $86 = $211 t-shirts sold. Therefore, there are at least 211 t-shirts sold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each t-shirt costs $51. Then, in the Texas Tech game, they offered an discount of $8 per t-shirt. So, the price of each t-shirt during the game was $43 ($51 - $8). Now, let's calculate how much money they sold altogether. They sold 130 t-shirts, so their total revenue from selling t-shirts is: $43 x 130 = $5290. Therefore, they made $5290 from selling t-shirts alone.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the store sold 14 t-shirts at $201 each, which means they earned $2856 from those sales ($201 x 14 = $2856).  Then, during the Texas Tech game, they sold another 14 t-shirts at $217 each, which means they earned an additional $3098 ($217 x 14 = $3098).  Therefore, in total, the store earned $5954 ($2856 + $3098 = $5954) from selling t-shirts.
"Response:  If they sold $60 worth of t-shirts during the competition and each t-shirt costs $10, then...

Answer: They sold 6 t-shirts."
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $215. Since there are 5 t-shirts in total, we can find out how much each t-shirt costs by dividing the total amount by the number of t-shirts: $215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt. Therefore, one t-shirt costs $43.
Response:  The store sold $5 for one t-shirt and $215 for another t-shirt during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, if they sold x t-shirts, they made $5x + $215x = $220x dollars in total.  Therefore, the store made $220x dollars selling t-shirts during the game.
Response:  The store sold $76 for one t-shirt and $204 for another t-shirt during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. Therefore, if we multiply these two amounts together, we get:  $76 x $204 = $15,960 So, the total amount of money that the store made from selling t-shirts during the game was $15,960.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money earned from selling shirts and hoodies is $550 ($210 + $240).  Secondly, we are told that there were 177 t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game. Thirdly, we are informed that each t-shirt was priced at $26. Finally, we can calculate the total revenue generated from selling t-shirts as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt = 177 x $26 = $4,692. Therefore, the price difference between the two types of clothing (t-shirts and hoodies) is $4,692 - $550 = $4,142. So, t-shirts are more expensive than hoodies by $4,142.
Response:  The store sold $115 for one t-shirt and $25 for another t-shirt. So, if we add up all the amounts, we get: $115 + $25 = $140. Therefore, there are more than 140 t-shirts sold in total.
Response:  If they have 5 tables with 10 chairs each, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. So, there are 50 - 5 = 45 more chairs than tables. Therefore, the answer is 45.
Response:  If they have decided to hold a party in their backyard and each table has an equal number of chairs as the other table, then we can assume that there are 6 chairs at each table. Since there are 12 chairs in total in the backyard, it means that each table will have 2 chairs (since 12 / 2 = 6). Therefore, one table will have 2 chairs and the other table will also have 2 chairs.
Response:  If they decided to hold the party in the backyard and there are 9 chairs in the backyard, then each table will have at most 3 chairs. Since there are 3 tables, the total number of chairs is 3 x 3 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 tables.
Response:  If they decided to hold the party in the backyard and there are 11 tables and 13 chairs available, then we can calculate the number of chairs per table as follows: Number of chairs / Number of tables = ___________ (11/11 = 1) So, each table has one chair. Now, let's count the total number of chairs: Total number of chairs = Number of chairs per table x Number of tables = 1 x 11 = 11 Therefore, there are 11 chairs in the backyard.
Response:  We know that there are 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60. Now, we need to find out how many chairs are empty if 11 people are sitting on them. To do this, we can subtract the number of people from the total number of chairs. Therefore, the number of empty chairs is 60 - 11 = 49.
Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each set has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Now, we need to find out how many extra chairs they have. They decided to hold a party in the backyard with 12 tables, which means they will use all 12 sets of chairs. Therefore, the number of extra chairs they have is 1 - (12/14) = 3 extra chairs. So, there are 3 extra chairs for their guests.
Response:  If there are 4 tables and each table has 3 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12 chairs.  Since 14 people will attend the party, we need additional 2 chairs to accommodate all the guests (14 - 12 = 2). Therefore, they should purchase 2 more chairs.
Response:  If they have decided to hold a party in their backyard and there are 14 chairs at each table, then the total number of chairs is: 14 x 9 = 126 chairs. So, there are 126 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Louis earns $50 per week for 5 weeks, he will have earned a total of $50 x 5 = $250.
Response:  Louis earned $1216 during the harvest period. If he earns $16 per day, how many days did the harvest last?  We can solve for x in the equation: $1216 = 16x Where x is the number of days the harvest lasted.  Now we can simplify and divide both sides by $16 to find the answer: $75 = x Therefore, the harvest lasted for 75 days.
Response:  Louis earned $216 per week for 21 years, which means he earned a total of $4,532 ($216 x 21). Then, he paid $702 in taxes, leaving him with $3,830 ($4,532 - $702).
"Response:  If Louis works for 223 weeks at $1357 per week, he will have earned a total of...

Answer: $\boxed{306,893}$ dollars."
"Response:  Louis worked for 1091 weeks and earned $28 per week. Additionally, he worked overtime for an average of 939 dollars per week. If he works overtime every week during the harvest season, how much money will he earn in total?

Let's calculate it step by step:

Total amount earned during regular work hours = 1091 x $28 = $296,780
Total amount earned through overtime = 939 x $939 = $854,510
Total amount earned during the harvest season = Total amount earned during regular work hours + Total amount earned through overtime = $296,780 + $854,510 = $1,151,290
Therefore, if Louis works overtime every week during the harvest season, he will earn approximately $1,151,290 in total."
Response:  Louis earned $403 per week for 233 weeks, which means he earned a total of $93,536 ($403 x 233). If he had to pay $49 rent every week, his total earnings would be reduced to $88,717 ($93,536 - $49 x 233). So, during the harvest season, Lewis made approximately $88,717.
Response:  Louis pays $368 per week during harvest season. If he has to pay $388 per week for rent, then he will have to pay $120 more than his usual rent during this time ($368 - $388 = $120). So, Louis will pay $488 per week in rent during harvest season.
Response:  Louis earned $491 per week for 1181 weeks, which means he earned a total of $573,011 ($491 x 1181). If he had to pay $216 in rent every week, his total expenses would be $253,666 ($216 x 1181), leaving him with a profit of $319,345 ($573,011 - $253,666).
Response:  If Louis earned $133 during his 19-week harvesting period, then he earned an average of $6.65 per day.
"Response:  Louis earned $2 per day for 178 days, so he earned in total...

Answer: $\boxed{178 \times 2 = 356}$ dollars.

Therefore, the duration of the harvest season is $\boxed{356 / 2 = 178}$ weeks."
"Response:  If Danny is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than him, then...

Step 1: Calculate the depth of the water in terms of Danny's height.
Depth = Water depth × 10 (since it's 10 times deeper)
= 9 ft × 10
= 90 ft

So, the depth of the water is 90 feet."
Response:  If Danny decides to swim after taking a rest, and the water is twice as deep as Danny's height, then... (1) The depth of the water is equal to Danny's height plus twice his height. So, if Danny is 2 meters tall, the depth of the water would be... (2) 2 + 2 = 4 meters. Therefore, the water was 4 meters deep.
Response:  If we decide to swim after resting for a while, and the depth of water is 5 times deeper than the height of Ron, then the depth of water would be 5 x 12 = 60 feet (approximately). Since Dien is 3 meters shorter than Ron, the depth of water would be 60 - 3 = 57 feet (approximately). So, the depth of water would be around 57 feet if Ron is 12 feet tall and he stands in water that is 12 feet deep.
"Response:  If we decide to swim after resting for a while, and the depth of water is 15 times deeper than Dien's height, then...

Dien's height = 1 meter more than Ron's height
Ron's height = 13 feet (approximately 4 meters)

So, the depth of water = 15 x (1 meter + 1 meter) = 15 x 2 meters = 30 meters
Therefore, the depth of water is approximately 30 meters."
Response:  If we decide to swim after resting for a while, and the depth of the water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, which means that if Ron is 13 feet (approximately 4 meters) tall, then the depth of the water would be...
Response:  If Ding is 6 feet shorter than Ron and Ron is 15 feet tall, then Ding's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet tall. So, the depth of the water is 9 times deeper than Ding's height, which is 9 x 9 = 81 feet deep.
Response:  If there are 34 books in total and they are divided into two bookshelves with equal number of books in each shelf, then we can assume that each shelf has 17 books (half of 34). So, there will be 17 books in one shelf and 17 + 17 = 34 books in the other shelf. Therefore, there are 34 books in total.
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each bookshelf holds 2 books, then...

1. How many bookshelves does Brian have if he has 42 books?
Answer: 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves
2. How many books are in each bookshelf if Brian has 21 bookshelves?
Answer: 21 x 2 = 42 books
3. Therefore, Brian has 42 books in total."
Response:  If Brian has 23 bookshelves and each shelf can hold 27 books, then he has a total of 23 x 27 = 591 books. Additionally, if he has 80 magazines, that is an additional 80 books. So in total, Brian has 591 + 80 = 671 books.
Response:  If Brian has 10 bookshelves and he has 9 books in each shelf, then he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. Now, if he also has 46 magazines, then we need to find out how many magazines are left after giving him 90 books. So, the number of magazines Brian has is 46 - (90 / 10) = 46 - 9 = 37 magazines. Therefore, Brian has 37 magazines.
Response:  Brain has 29 bookshelves and each shelf can hold 23 books, so the total number of books he has is: 29 x 23 = 673 books. Additionally, there are 61 issues of magazines, which means the total number of publications Brain has is: 61 x 4 (since each issue usually contains 4 pages) = 244 magazines. Therefore, in total, Brain has 673 + 244 = 917 publications.
Response:  If Brian has 7 books with him and each book contains 5 copies of the same book, then he has a total of 7 x 5 = 35 books.  Since he also has 28 books in total, that means there are 28 - 35 = 5 other books that he does not have with him. Therefore, there is one book without any copies inside it.
"Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each book case contains 2 books, then...

1. The number of book cases = Total number of books / Number of books in each case
= 38 books / 2 books per case
= 19 bookcases
Therefore, Brian has 19 bookcases."
Response:  Carol sent invitations to 10 friends for her birthday party. Each invitation has two RSVP cards inside. Therefore, we need $ \frac{10}{2} = 5$ invitations to ensure that at least one friend does not receive multiple RSVP cards. $\blacksquare$
Response:  Carol sent invitations to 12 friends for her birthday party. Since each friend received 3 invitation cards, the total number of invitation cards is 12 x 3 = 36. So, there are 36 invitation cards in total.
Response:  If Carol sent invitation cards to only two friends, then she had 10 - 2 = 8 invitation cards left. So, there are 8 invitation cards remaining after she sent them to her two friends.
Response:  Carol bought 14 invitation cards and gave 6 of them to her friends. So, she has 8 remaining invitations (14 - 6 = 8). Then, she invited additional 11 people, so in total, she invited 19 people (8 + 11 = 19). Therefore, Carol can invite up to 19 people to her friend's birthday party.
Response:  If Carol invited 9 friends to her birthday party and she bought 3 invitation cards, then she has 3 x 9 = 27 invitations in total. So, if she wants to invite more than 9 friends, she needs to buy additional invitation cards. Therefore, the answer is 27 + (number of extra guests).
Response:  Melissa scored 12 points in each game, so she scored a total of 36 points from playing 3 games. Therefore, the number of games played is 3.
Response:  Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points. Since she scored the same number of points in each game, we can say that her average score per game is 81/3 = 27 points. So, Melissa scored 27 points per game.
Response:  Melissa scored 109 points per game and obtained 82 bonus points per game. Therefore, her total score for 79 games can be calculated as follows: Total score = (Number of games x Points scored per game) + (Number of games x Bonus points obtained) Total score = (79 x 109) + (79 x 82) Total score = 8,651 + 6,334 Total score = 14,985 So, Melissa scored 14,985 points in 79 games.
"Response:  Melissa scored 21 points in total across several games. If she scored 7 points per game, then...

Answer: 4 games"
Response:  Melissa scored 91 points in total across 13 games. If she scored the same number of points every game, then we can say that her average score per game is 91/13 = 7 points per game. So, Melissa scored 7 points more than the previous game each time.
Response:  Since there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel, and 20 people can ride it at once, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many people can sit on each seat. So, the answer is: 5 people per seat.
"Response:  If Paraiso Park has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then the total number of seats in the park is:

18 x 9 = 162 seats
So, if 18 people are riding at the same time, the ferry wheel will have 162 seats."
Response:  Since each parking space has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people, we have a total of 19 x 15 = 285 people who can be accommodated in all the parking spaces at once. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can take 20 parking spaces simultaneously is 285 / 20 = 14 people.
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in the ferry and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total number of people who can board the ferry at once is:

18 seats x 15 people/seat = 270 people
So, if 10 seats are damaged, the maximum number of people who can board the ferry simultaneously is:

270 people - 10 seats = 260 people"
Response:  If there are already 16 people sitting in the Ferris wheel, and each seat can accommodate 14 people, then we have a total of 16 x 14 = 224 seats available. So, if more people want to join the Ferris wheel, they could add up to 224 more people.
Response:  Since there are 2 small chairs and 23 large chairs in the park, we can accommodate a total of 37 people (2 x 2 = 4 small chairs + 23 x 54 = 1208 large chairs). So, if all the small chairs are occupied with 14 people each, then the remaining 4 small chairs can accommodate 56 people (4 x 14 = 56). Therefore, the number of people who can sit on the small chairs is 56.
Response:  We know that there are 7 big seats and each can accommodate 12 people. So, total number of people who can sit in big seats is 7 x 12 = 84. Now, we have to subtract the number of people who can sit in small seats from the total number of people who can sit in big seats. There are 3 small seats and each can accommodate 16 people. So, total number of people who can sit in small seats is 3 x 16 = 48. Therefore, the remaining number of people who can sit in big seats is 84 - 48 = 36. Hence, 36 people can sit in big seats.
Response:  If there are 16 people in Paradise Park and they all want to ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, then each gondola can hold 4 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can fit in each gondola is 4. Since there are 4 gondolas in total, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously is 4 x 4 = 16.
Response:  If there are 4 people in total and they all want to sit on the Ferris wheel at the same time, then each person will occupy one seat on the wheel. Since there are 8 seats in total (4 people x 2 seats per person), this means that 3 people will not be able to ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is 8 - 3 = 5.
"Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 14 slices, then...

Answer:  Each slice of pizza contains $ \boxed{3} $ pieces."
Response:  If there are 28 pieces of pizza and you ordered 3 pieces, then... (1) x 3 = 28 pieces of pizza were ordered in total. Therefore, the answer is 28.
"Response:  If we have 17 pizzas and each pizza is divided into 4 pieces, then... (1)

Answer: 17 x 4 = 68 pieces of pizza. So there will be 68 pieces of pizza in total."
Response:  If we have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza is divided into 10 slices, then... (1) We will get 90 slices of pizza in total. (2) Since there are two of us, we will get 45 slices each. Therefore, we will receive 45 slices of pizza each.
Response:  Since there are 45 flower stalks and each stalk has 10 seeds, the total number of seeds is 45 x 10 = 450 seeds. Therefore, the answer is 450 seeds.
"Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in each of the 9 flower pots, then...

Answer:  They would have planted a total of 45 x 9 = 385 seeds."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $PAGE$ and $\MOM$ together planted $36$ seeds.  Then, they separated into two groups of $12$ each to water them. So, in total, $48$ seeds were watered. Finally, only $58$ seeds germinated and bloomed into flowers. Therefore, there are $9$ flower pots.
Response:  If they planted 55 seeds and only 15 grew into flowers, then there are 40 unused seeds.  Since 60 seeds germinated and became flowers, we can conclude that the total number of seeds used is 60 + 40 = 100 seeds. Therefore, the number of flowers grown is 100 / 2 = 50 flowers.
Response:  If Pajeon (PAIGEON) had planted 10 seeds in the soil and then added another 60 seeds later, the total number of seeds would be 70. So, the number of flowers that will bloom is 70.
Response:  If they had put 32 seeds in each pot and there were 10 pots, then the total number of seeds they planted would be: 32 x 10 = 320 seeds.  Therefore, if they had put an equal number of seeds in each flower stem, then there would be 320 seeds in each stem.
Response:  If Matt gave each of his 11 friends 2 crackers, then he had 2 x 11 = 22 crackers in total. So, Matt had 22 crackers.
Response:  If Matt gave each of his friends 2 crackers from the bag he had, then the number of friends who received crackers would be: 2 (the number of crackers given out) x 7 (the number of friends). So, 14 friends received crackers in total.
Response:  Matt had 15 crackers and he divided them equally among his 5 friends. So each friend got 3 crackers. If 10 remained after they were divided, then each of Matt's friends got 2 crackers (since there are 5 friends). Therefore, one of Matt's friends ate 2 crackers.
Response:  If Matt had 24 crackers and shared them equally among his three friends, each friend would get 8 crackers (24 / 3 = 8).  Now, if Matt wanted to share the remaining 17 crackers equally among his three friends again, he would give 5 crackers to each friend (17 / 3 = 5).
Response:  Matt had 22 crackers and shared them equally among 11 friends. So each friend got 22/11 = 2 cracker slices. Then, Matt gave each of his 11 friends 34 cookies to share equally. Since there are 11 friends in total, they will get 34 / 11 = 3 cookie slices each. Therefore, each person ate 2 + 3 = 5 pieces of food.
"Response:  Matt had 29 crackers and 30 cookies. If he shares them equally among his friends, each friend will get:

Crackers: 29 / 5 = 5.8 (rounded to nearest whole number)
Cookies: 30 / 5 = 6 (rounded to nearest whole number)
So, each friend will eat 5.8 crackers and 6 cookies respectively."
Response:  Matt had 14 crackers and 21 cookies. If he shares them equally among his 7 friends, each friend will get... (use algebra to solve)...crackers and cookies. So, each person got... (divide the total number of crackers and cookies by the number of people)...crackers and cookies.
"Response:  If Matt gave each of his 18 friends an identical cracker, and there are 36 crackers in total, then...

Step 1: How many crackers did Matt give to each friend?
Answer: 18 friends x 1 cracker per friend = 18 crackers given by Matt.

Step 2: How many crackers are left after Matt gave them away?
Answer: Total number of crackers - Number of crackers given by Matt = 36 - 18 = 18 crackers left.

Therefore, each person received 1/18 or 0.055 (approximately) of the total number of crackers."
Response:  Matt has given each of his 5 friends 6 crackers each, so he has given out a total of 30 crackers (5 x 6 = 30). If Matt now wants to give away all 36 crackers, that means he will have 6 crackers left over for himself (36 - 30 = 6). Therefore, Matt gave away 30 crackers to his friends and kept 6 for himself.
Response:  Matt had 23 crackers and gave 11 to his two friends. So, he had 23 - 11 = 12 crackers left. Now, each of his friends got an equal number of crackers as Matt had left, so they together had 2 x 12 = 24 crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers eaten is 23 + 24 = 47 crackers.
Response:  Matt had 31 crackers and gave 5 of them to his friends. So he has 31 - 5 = 26 crackers left. Now, he wants to share these remaining crackers equally among his 5 friends. Therefore, each friend will get 26 / 5 = 5 crackers.  Hence, Matt gave 5 crackers to each of his 5 friends.
Response:  If Matt had 32 pieces of crackers and wanted to divide them equally among his four friends, each friend would get 8 crackers (32 / 4 = 8).  Now, if he also had 98 pieces of cake and wanted to divide them equally among his four friends, each friend would get 24.5 pieces of cake (98 / 4 = 24.5).
Response:  If Matt had 10 crackers and 8 cakes to share among his 4 friends, each friend would get how many crackers and cakes?  We can start by dividing the total number of crackers (10) by the number of friends (4): Each friend gets 2.5 crackers.  Now, let's divide the total number of cakes (8) by the number of friends (4): Each friend gets 2 cakes. Therefore, each friend got 2 crackers and 2 cakes in total.
Response:  If Matt has initially 13 crackers and 15 cookies, and he wants to share them equally among his 28 friends, then each friend will get... (use algebra)...crackers and cookies. So, the total number of crackers and cookies each friend gets is... (use multiplication). Therefore, the answer is... (state your final answer).
"Response:  If she drank 109 bottles of water in one day, and if this continued for 74 days, then she would have drunk a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of bottles} = \text{Number of bottles per day} \times \text{Number of days} $$

So, the total number of bottles she would have drunk is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of bottles}} = 109 \times 74 = 8266 $$

Therefore, she would have drunk $8266$ bottles of water over the course of $74$ days."
"Response:  If Debi had 153 bottles of water and drank the same amount every day for 17 days, then she would have drunk:

Day 1: 153/1 = 153 bottles
Day 2: 153 x 2 = 306 bottles
Day 3: 153 x 3 = 459 bottles
...
Day 17: 153 x 17 = 2,591 bottles
Therefore, Debi would have drunk 2,591 bottles of water in total over the course of 17 days."
"Response:  Debi bought 264 water bottles at a discounted price of $1 each. If she drinks 15 bottles per day, how many bottles will be left after 11 days?

To find out, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Debi has after 11 days. We know that Debi buys 264 bottles initially and drinks 15 bottles per day, so the total number of bottles she consumes in one day is:

$$ Total = 264 \times 15 = 3900 $$

Now, let's find out how many bottles are left after 11 days:

$$ Remaining = Total - (Total \* Number of Days) $$

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

$$ Remaining = 3900 - (3900 \* 11) = 3900 - 43900 = -3910 $$

So, there are -3910 water bottles left after 11 days."
Response:  If she drank 301 ml of water per day and had 144 ml left after one day, then she drank for x days. So, we can write an equation: 301 = x \* 144. Solving for x, we get: x = 157. Therefore, she drank for 157 days.
Response:  If Debi drank 88 ml of water and 13 ml of juice per day, then in one hour she would drink 0.88/60 = 0.146 ml/min of water and 0.13/60 = 0.022 ml/min of juice.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total amount of water and juice drunk per hour as follows: Water: 0.146 ml/min x 60 min/hour = 8.69 ml/hour Juice: 0.022 ml/min x 60 min/hour = 1.32 ml/hour Now, if Debi drinks 4 ml of water and 87 ml of juice per day, then in one hour she will drink 4/60 = 0.067 ml/min of water and 87/60 = 1.45 ml/min of juice. Therefore, the water bottle will last for approximately 12.5 hours (8.69 ml/hour x 12 hours), while the juice bottle will last for approximately 10.5 hours (1.45 ml/min x 60 min/hour).
Response:  If she drank 200 ml of water and 256 ml of juice per day, then in one day, she drank a total of 200 + 256 = 456 ml of liquid.  Since she drank 312 ml of liquid per day, it means that she drank an additional 312 - 456 = -144 ml of liquid per day.  Therefore, the number of days she can continue drinking juice without running out is infinite.
Response:  If she drinks 6 bottles of water per day, then in one week (7 days), she will have drunk 42 bottles (6 x 7). In one month (30 days), she will have drunk 126 bottles (42 x 3). Therefore, if she continues to drink at this rate for several months, it is likely that her body will be able to store enough water to last for several weeks or even months without any additional water intake.
Response:  If she drank 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, then in one day she drank a total of: Water = 15 x 30 ml/bottle = 450 ml Soda = 54 x 200 ml/bottle = 10,800 ml In one day, she consumed a total of: Total consumption = 450 + 10,800 = 11,250 ml Now, let's assume that she continues to drink at this rate for 95 days (which is the number of days Devy had the soda). Therefore, her total consumption over these 95 days would be: Total consumption = Daily consumption x Number of days = 11,250 x 95 = 1,037,500 ml So, if Devy continued to drink at this rate for 95 days, she would have consumed approximately 1,037,500 milliliters of liquid.
Response:  If she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, then in one day... (1 rated)
"Response:  If there are 14 lines and each line has 11 pens, then the total number of pens is:

14 x 11 = 154

So, Pea has 154 pens in total."
Response:  If she placed 12 pens in total and divided them into 3 rows of equal length, then each row would have how many pens?  To find out, we can divide 12 by 3, which gives us 4. So, there are 4 pens in each row. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of pens is 3 x 4 = 12. Therefore, she placed 12 pens in total.
Response:  If Pea has 16 pencils and she wants to make as many groups of 3 pencils each, how many groups can she make? She can make 16 / 3 = 5 groups. Now, if she has 28 pens and each group requires 24 pens, then she can make 5 x 24 = 120 groups. Therefore, the number of groups Pea can make is 120.
Response:  We know that there are 22 pencils in each row and 6 pens in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rows as follows: Number of rows = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per row = 22 x 5 = 110 rows So, the girl has 110 rows of pencils.
Response:  If Pea has 35 pens and wants to make 5 pens at a time, she can make a total of 35/5 = 7 groups of pens. Similarly, if she has 7 colored pencils and wants to make 5 at a time, she can make a total of 7/5 = 1 group of colored pencils. Therefore, the answer is 7 + 1 = 8 groups.
Response:  If there are 19 rows and each row has 4 pens and 27 pencils, then the total number of pens is 19 x 4 = 76. Similarly, the total number of pencils is 19 x 27 = 503. So, Pea has 76 pens and 503 pencils.
"Response:  If Pea has 7 lines of pens and pencils, each line contains 36 pens and 30 pencils. Therefore, in total, Pea has:

Pens: 7 x 36 = 252 pens
Pencils: 7 x 30 = 210 pencils
So, Pea has 462 objects (252 pens + 210 pencils) in total."
"Response:  If Pea has 11 rows of sticks with 31 beans and 27 eggs in each row, then...

Answer:  The total number of beans Pea has is 31 x 11 = 341.
The total number of eggs Pea has is 27 x 11 = 297."
Response:  If Paige has 30 pens and wants to arrange them in 5 rows of how many pens each row can hold? To find this out, we need to divide 30 by 5. So, each row can hold 6 pens (30 / 5 = 6). Therefore, Paige could have arranged 6 pens in each of the 5 rows, for a total of 30 pens.
"Response:  If there are 6 pens and we want to divide them into two lines of 3 pens each, then...

1. The first line will have 3 pens (since there are 6 pens in total).
2. The second line will also have 3 pens (since there are only 3 pens left after dividing 6 pens into two lines).

Therefore, the answer is 3 x 3 = 9 pens in total."
Response:  We know that Paige has 35 pens and each pen contains 4 pens inside it. So, in total, she has 35 x 4 = 140 pens. Now, we are asked how many rows of pens can be made with these pens. Each row has 2 pens, so we can make 140 / 2 = 70 rows of pens. Therefore, the answer is 70 rows of pens.
Response:  We know that Paige has 31 pens and each pen contains 6 pens. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 pens. Now, we are asked how many pencils Paige has. Since she divided them into 19 groups, it means she has 19 x 6 = 114 pencils. Therefore, Paige has 186 + 114 = 300 pencils.
Response:  If Pei has 30 rows of strawberries and each row contains 71 strawberries, then she has a total of.......................strawberries.  Similarly, if each row contains 24 lettuces, then she has a total of..........................lettuces. Therefore, the total number of strawberries Pei has is............................strawberries, and the total number of lettuces she has is............................lettuces.
Response:  If Pei has 16 rows of pens and each row contains 6 pens, then she has a total of 16 x 6 = 96 pens.  However, if there are 21 pens in each row, then she has a total of 96 x 21 = 2048 pens. Therefore, Pei has 2048 pens in total.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students attending it. Since each bus can accommodate at most 7 students per seat, we need to divide 98 by 7 to find out how many seats are available on each bus. Therefore, the number of seats on each bus is 98/7 = 14. So, there are 14 seats on each of the 7 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 school buses to transport students. Since each bus can seat 118 students, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity of each bus Total number of students = 84 x 118 = 9620 students Therefore, there are approximately 9620 students in this school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 67 x 66 = 4282 students.  Now, if each bus can accommodate 6 passengers, then to transport all these students for a field trip, we will need (4282 students / 6 passengers per bus) = 713 buses.  So, we need 713 buses to take all the students for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students. So, the total number of students in all classrooms is 87 x 58 = 4960 students. Since each bus can accommodate 2 students, we need 4960 / 2 = 248 buses to transport all the students for this field trip. Therefore, the answer is 248 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 24 x 120 = 2880 students. Now, we need to find out how many students are in each bus. Since there are 84 seats in each bus, the number of students who can go for the field trip is 84 / 2 = 42 students per bus. So, the total number of students going for the field trip is 42 x 6 = 252 students.
"Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms in the school and 102 students attending it. Since each bus can accommodate 8 students, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many buses will be needed for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is: 

Answer = 102 / 8 = 13
So, 13 buses will be needed for the field trip if 22 students do not want to go."
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. Since each bus can accommodate 99 passengers, we need to find out how many buses will be needed for all the students to go on the field trip. To do this, we divide the number of students (11) by the capacity of each bus (99):  Number of buses required = Number of students / Capacity of each bus = 11 / 99 = 0.11 or approximately 1 bus. Therefore, about 1 bus will be needed for all the students to go on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each bus can accommodate 3 students per seat. So, we need to divide 111 students among the available buses. To do this, we will use division.  Division is a way of dividing a quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we want to divide 111 students into 36 groups (or buses) so that each group has exactly 3 students.  How many buses do we need?  Well, if we have 111 students and we want to divide them into 36 groups, then we will need 36 / 3 = 12 buses! That means we will need 12 buses for our field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms in the school and 92 students attend the school. Since all buses are full, we can assume that each bus has at least one seat for every student. Therefore, the number of seats on each bus is: Number of seats = Total number of students / Number of buses = 92 / 46 = 2 So, there are 2 seats per bus.
Response:  If Haley has 9 marbles and she gives one to each of her male classmates, then she will have 9 - 9 = 0 marbles left. So, Haley had 0 marbles before giving them away.
Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and gives 5 of them to each of the 5 boys, then she will have given away 5 x 5 = 25 marbles in total. So, there are 7 marbles left with Haley (10 - 25 = 7).
Response:  Since there are 4 boys in total and each boy wants to receive at least 15 marbles, we can start by giving each boy 15 marbles initially. Then, since there are 23 marbles left after giving out 15 marbles to each boy, we will have 8 marbles remaining (23 - 15 x 4 = 8). So, each boy will get 15 + 8 = 23 marbles in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 boys who like dumplings and 50 boys who like cards. So, in total, there are 63 boys (13 + 50). Now, let's consider how many pieces of candy each boy will receive. Since Hayley has 26 candies, she can give 26/63 = 0.40 or approximately 4 candies to each boy. Therefore, each of the 63 boys will receive 4 candies from Hayley.
"Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and she gives each of her classmates two marbles equally, then... (1/3)

Answer:...the number of marbles each male student will receive is 4 (since there are 4 male students in total). Therefore, if Haley gives each of them an equal amount of marbles, they will receive 4 marbles each."
Response:  If there are 28 gems and 4 male students in total, then each student will receive 7 gems (28 / 4 = 7). So, 3 males will receive gems.
Response:  We know that Frank read for 392 pages in total and he read 14 pages per day. So, to find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he read per day: 392 / 14 = 27 days. Therefore, Frank finished reading the book in 27 days.
Response:  We know that Frank read for 569 days and he reads 22 pages per day. So, we can calculate the total number of pages he read as follows: Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day Total pages = 569 x 22 = 12380 pages Therefore, there are 12380 pages in the book Frank was reading.
Response:  The book had 612 pages and was divided into 24 chapters. Frank took 6 days to finish reading the book. So, he read approximately __________ pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank liked reading a book with 555 pages divided into 5 chapters. If it took him 220 days to finish reading the entire book, we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Total number of pages = Number of pages in the book x Total time taken to finish the book
= 555 x 220
= 123,750 pages

Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find out how many pages were in each chapter:

Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 123,750 / 5
= 24,750 pages per chapter

Therefore, each chapter in the book had approximately 24,750 pages."
Response:  We know that Frank liked to read books and this particular book had 15 chapters with an average of 12 pages per chapter. So, we can calculate the total number of pages Frank read as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Average pages per chapter Total pages = 15 x 12 = 180 pages Now, we are asked how many days it took Frank to finish reading the book. According to the passage, it took him 660 days to complete the book. Therefore, the answer is: Days taken to finish reading the book = 660 days
Response:  We know that Frank read 3 days and each book had 249 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank read in total as follows: Total pages = Number of books x Number of pages per book Total pages = 3 x 249 = 747 pages Therefore, Frank read 747 pages in total during those 3 days.
Response:  If Frank read all books in 492 days, and each book is 66 pages long, then he must have read:  Number of books = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read them = 492 days x 66 pages/day = 3170 pages  So, Frank must have read 3170 pages in total.
Response:  If Frank took 16 days to read his book and it has 112 pages, then he read an average of pages per day.  Therefore, if he read for one hour each day, he would have read approximately hours.
Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and there are 576 pages in total, it will take him... (do the calculation)...days to finish reading the book!
Response:  We know that Frank liked to read books and this particular book had 41 chapters, each of which was 450 pages long. So, in total, there were 17650 pages (41 x 450) in the book. Now, we are asked how many days it took Frank to finish reading the entire book. Since he spent 30 days reading it, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book In this case, the number of pages read per day is: 17650 pages / 30 days = 585 pages per day Now, let's convert this value to hours: Hours = Pages per day x Reading time per page For Frank, the reading time per page was assumed to be 1 hour (based on the given information). Therefore, the number of hours Frank spent reading the book per day is: Hours = 585 pages/day x 1 hour/page = 585 hours So, Frank finished reading the entire book in 585 hours or approximately 24.5 days.
Response:  According to the passage, Frank read a book that had 594 pages divided into three parts. He completed the book in 607 days. So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank read per day as follows: Number of pages / Number of days = ___________ pages/day Now, let's substitute the values given in the passage: Number of pages = 594 Pages/day = 594 / 607 = 0.98 pages/day Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.98 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 664 days and there are two volumes of 405 pages each. So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank read per day as follows:

Total pages = 2 x 405 = 810 pages
Days taken to complete the book = 664 days
Pages read per day = Total pages / Days taken to complete the book
= 810 / 664
= 1.25 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 1.25 pages per day during his 664-day reading marathon."
"Response:  If we have 6 DVD packages and each package costs $120, then...

Answer: $120 x 6 = $720."
Response:  If one pack of Han-Pac costs $81, then we can assume that each Han-Pac contains $81 / 33 = $2.57 worth of goods (DVDs). So, to find out how many DVDs are in 33 packets of Han-Pac, we divide $2.57 by $2.57 and get 1.3. Therefore, there are approximately 1.3 DVDs in each packet of Han-Pac.
Response:  If one pack of DVDs costs $107, and there is a discount of $106, then we can calculate the price of each DVD as follows:  Price = Original price - Discount = $107 - $106 = $1 Price per DVD = $1 / Number of DVDs in the package = $1/10 = $0.10 per DVD So, you could buy 93 DVDs with the remaining amount of $93 after applying the discount.
Response:  If one package of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25, then we can calculate the price of one package as follows:  Price = Original price x (1 - Discount percentage) / 100  In this case, the original price of one package is $76, and the discount percentage is 25/100 = 0.25. So, the price of one package after the discount is: Price = $76 x (1 - 0.25) / 100 = $76 x 0.75 / 100 = $54 Therefore, if you want to buy one package of DVDs with a discount of $25, you will have to pay $54.
Response:  If $104 is divided by $26, we get... (calculate)...the result is... (display answer). So, you can buy... (display number of DVDs).
Response:  If we have $28 to spend and we want to buy two DVD packs, then each pack must cost less than or equal to $\$14$. Therefore, the price of one DVD pack is $\$14 \div 2 = \$7$.
Response:  If there are 18 bananas and they are divided into two sizes (small or large), then we can create 3 groups of bananas based on their size: Small group: 6 bananas Large group: 12 bananas So, there will be 3 groups of bananas.
"Response:  If there are 187 bananas in Philip's collection and they are grouped into 140 groups of different sizes, then we can calculate the number of bananas in each group as follows:

Group size = Total number of bananas / Number of groups
= 187 / 140
= 1.32 (round to nearest whole number)

So, approximately 1.32 bananas are in each group. Since there are 140 groups, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is:

Total number of bananas = Number of groups x Approximate number of bananas per group
= 140 x 1.32
= 185.6 (round to nearest whole number)

Therefore, there are approximately 185.6 bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. Since we want to find out how many groups of bananas can be formed with 7 members each, let's divide 203 bananas by 7: 203 / 7 = 29 So, there are 29 groups of bananas with 7 members each. Now, let's move on to finding out how many groups of oranges can be formed with 95 members each. To do this, we need to divide 63 oranges by 95: 63 / 95 = 0.66 So, there are approximately 66 groups of oranges with 95 members each. Therefore, the answer is: Number of groups of bananas = 29 Number of groups of oranges = 66
Response:  We know that Philip has 142 bananas and 356 oranges in his collection. Since there are 47 groups of bananas, we can assume that each group contains an equal number of bananas (i.e., 47 x 1 = 47). Similarly, since there are 178 groups of oranges, each group must contain an equal number of oranges (i.e., 178 x 1 = 178). Therefore, the size of each orange group is 178.
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains an average of 2 bananas (as given in the problem). Therefore, the total number of bananas in all the groups is:

$$ \text {Total number of bananas} = \text {Number of groups} \times \text{Average number of bananas per group} $$
= $ 196 \times 2 $
= $ 392 $
Therefore, each group of bananas contains approximately $ 2 $ bananas."
Response:  If there are 18 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains 10 bananas, then we have: Number of groups = 18 x 10 = 180 So, there will be 180 groups of bananas in Philip's collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups of 145 each. So, the size of each group is:

Group 1: Number of bananas = 290 / 2 = 145

Now, we need to find out how many oranges are in each orange group. There are 87 oranges in total and they are divided into 93 groups of oranges. So, the number of oranges in each group is:

Number of oranges per group = Total number of oranges / Number of groups = 87 / 93 = 0.92

Therefore, each group of bananas contains approximately 145 bananas, and each group of oranges contains approximately 0.92 oranges."
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into groups of 345 each, then the number of orange groups will be: Number of oranges = Total number of fruits - Number of bananas = 384 - 192 = 192 So, each orange group has 16 fruits (orange).
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 38 cookies and each cookie has 19 pieces, then...

Answer: 38 x 19 = 702
So, Brenda's mother made 702 cookies for her guests."
Response:  If Brenda's mother gave each of the 14 people 30 cookies, then the total number of cookies given out is: 14 x 30 = 420 cookies. So, Brenda's mother prepared 420 cookies in total.
Response:  Brenda's mom gave cookies to 5 people, and she prepared 22 cookies in total. If each person got an equal number of cookies, then the number of cookies each person got is: Number of cookies = Total number of cookies / Number of people = 22 / 5 = 4.4 per person (round down to nearest whole number) So, each of the 5 people got 4 cookies each.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 18 cookies and each guest had an equal number of cookies, then the total number of cookies eaten would be 18 / 3 = 6 per guest. So, if there were 9 guests who did not come, then they would have eaten 9 x 6 = 54 cookies in total.
Response:  Brenda's mother gave each of her two guests 7 cookies (since there are 2 guests). So, if each guest had an equal number of cookies, then together they would have 14 cookies (the total number given by Brenda's mother). Therefore, each guest had 7 cookies.
Response:  Brenda's mother prepared cookies for her guests, and each guest was given two cookies. Therefore, if Brenda's mother prepared a total of 10 cookies, then she must have hosted __________ (10/2 =) guests. So, there were 5 guests in total.
"Response:  If Frank has 42 candies and he puts an equal number of candies in each of two bags, then... (1 mark)

Answer explanation: In this case, if Frank has 42 candies and he divides them equally between two bags, then each bag will contain 42/2 = 21 candies. (1 mark)"
"Response:  If Frank has 26 bags of candy and each bag contains 33 pieces, then...

1. The total number of candies Frank has is 26 x 33 = 847.

Therefore, Frank has 847 pieces of candy in total."
Response:  Frank had 33 pieces of candy initially and lost 24 pieces. So he has 9 pieces left. If he puts these remaining pieces in 9 separate bags, how many bags does he have?  Therefore, the answer is 9 bags.
Response:  If Frank has 11 bags of candy and there are 22 types of candies in total, then each bag must contain an average of 22/11 = 2 candies. So, there must be 11 x 2 = 22 bags of candy in total.
Response:  We know that Frank has 16 candies and he wants to divide them equally between two bags. So, if we divide 16 by 2, we get 8. Therefore, each bag will have 8 candies.
Response:  We know that Shelly has sold 25 boxes of crepes and there are 14 boxes left. To find out how many boxes she needs to deliver, we need to divide the number of remaining boxes by the number of boxes she wants to deliver. So, in this case, Shelly needs to deliver 3 boxes (14 - 25 = 3).
"Response:  If we sold 10 boxes of crepes for $5 each and want to deliver 5 boxes, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total amount earned from selling the crepes.
Total amount = Number of boxes x Price per box
= 10 x $5
= $50

Step 2: Calculate the number of crepes in each box.
Number of crepes = Total amount / Price per crepe
= $50 / $5
= 10

So there are 10 crepes in each box. Therefore, if we deliver 5 boxes, we will have 5 x 10 = 50 crepes in total."
Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of general soju and 9 bottles of diet soju in the store. To find out how many more bottles of general soju than diet soju are present, we need to subtract the number of diet soju from the total number of soju bottles. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of more bottles of general soju = Total number of soju bottles - Number of diet soju bottles = 67 - 9 = 58 So, there are 58 more bottles of general soju than diet soju in the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 bottles of general soju and 61 bottles of diet soju in the store. To find out if the number of diet soju bottles is greater than or equal to the number of general soju bottles, we can divide both numbers by 2 and compare them directly. So, 22 / 2 = 11 and 61 / 2 = 30.5. Since 30.5 is closer to 22 than 61, we can conclude that there are more general soju bottles (22) than diet soju bottles (61). Therefore, the answer is (B).
Response:  The total number of bottles of general soju is 30, and the diet soju is 8. So, the total number of bottles of soju is 30 + 8 = 38. Now, let's count the apples. There are 41 apples in total. Therefore, the final answer is 38 (bottles of soju) x 41 (apples) = 1568.
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of general soju and 53 bottles of diet soju in the store. To find out how many more bottles of general soju than diet soju, we can subtract their numbers:  So, there are 79 - 53 = 26 more bottles of general soju than diet soju in the store.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda in total. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of diet soda from the total number of soda bottles. So, the answer is:

Number of more bottles of regular soda = Total number of soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles
= 83 - 54
= 29
Therefore, there are 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles of drink in total and 9 of them were regular soda. So, the number of diet sodas is 9 - 9 = 0. Therefore, the person drank 0 diet sodas.  As for the apples, we are told that they had 29 apples in total, so the person ate 29 apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda in the store. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of diet soda from the total number of soda bottles. So, the answer is:

Number of more bottles of regular soda = Total number of soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles
= 60 - 19
= 41
Therefore, there are 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
"Response:  We know that there are 72 bottles of general soju and 32 bottles of diet soju in the store. Also, we have 78 apples. So, if we assume that each bottle of soju contains 1 liter (which is a common volume for soju), then:

Total volume of general soju = 72 x 1 L = 72 L
Total volume of diet soju = 32 x 1 L = 32 L
Total volume of both types of soju = Total volume of general soju + Total volume of diet soju = 72 L + 32 L = 104 L
Now, let's find out how many apples are left after consuming some soju. If we consume x liters of soju, then the number of apples left will be:
Number of apples left = Total volume of apples - Volume of soju consumed = 78 - x L
So, to find out how many apples were consumed, we need to solve for x:
x = Number of apples left / Total volume of apples = 78 - 104 = -26
Therefore, there are 26 apples left in the store after consuming some soju."
"Response:  The total number of sodas available in the store is 80 bottles. If there were 36 apples and the customer drank more than 36 bottles of soda, then the difference between the number of apples and soda drunk can be calculated as follows:

Difference = Number of Sodas consumed - Number of Apples consumed
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, the customer drank 44 bottles of soda more than the number of apples available in the store."
Response:  We know that there are total of 30 bowls in the store and out of those, 28 bowls are regular soy sauce and only 2 bowls are diet soy sauce. So, the number of diet soy sauce bowls is 2.
Response:  If the diet soda store had 4 bottles of diet soda and they also had 79 bottles of regular soda, then we can find out how many bottles of regular soda they have by dividing the number of regular soda bottles by the number of diet soda bottles. So, 79 / 4 = 19.75. Therefore, the diet soda store has approximately 20 bottles of regular soda.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 57 bottles of general soju in the store. Then, we are told that 26 bottles of diet soju and 27 bottles of light soju were also available. So, the total number of soju bottles in the store is: 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 bottles. Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of general soju in total.  From this information alone, we can conclude that there are at least 20 more bottles of general soju than diet soju (60 - 31 = 29). Therefore, there are 29 + 31 = 57 bottles of general soju in total.
Response:  We know that there are 49 bottles of general soju and 40 bottles of diet soju in the store. So, the total number of bottles of soju is: 49 + 40 = 89 bottles.
Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 317 visitors that day, then the difference between the number of visitors the previous day (295) and the current day is:  317 - 295 = 22   So, there were 22 more visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day after they had a rich meal compared to the previous day.
"Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 703 visitors that night, then...

Answer:  Of course! Here is how we can calculate the number of people who visited Buckingham Palace on that day:

Let X be the number of visitors who went to Buckingham Palace on that day.
We know that 703 people visited the palace that night, so X + 703 = 1000 (since 1000 - 703 = 297).
Now, we need to find out what value of X satisfies this equation. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 703:X + 703 = 1000 → X = 297.
So, there were 297 people who visited Buckingham Palace on that day."
Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 100 visitors that day, then the number of visitors the next day would be 666 - 100 = 566 more than the previous day. Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace that day was 666 + 566 = 1232.
"Response:  We know that after they had a rich meal, they went to Buckingham Palace and found out that 132 visitors were there that day. So, if 406 people visited Buckingham Palace in total during the past 327 days, then the number of visitors per day is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of visitors per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of visitors}}{ \text{Days}} } $$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of visitors per day} = \frac{406}{327} = 1.25} $$
Therefore, approximately $1.25$ people visited Buckingham Palace every day over the past $327$ days."
Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and then 45 people came to visit that night, then we can assume that there were 45 / 85 = 0.53 people per day who visited Buckingham Palace during the past 85 days. So, there were approximately 0.53 x 829 = 437 people who visited Buckingham Palace in total over the past 85 days.
"Response:  We know that after they had a rich meal, they went to Buckingham Palace and found out that there were 71 paintings inside. If Rachel visited the palace 188 times during those 57 days, then the number of people who visited the palace during that time is:

$$ \boxed{557} $$

So, the answer is $557$."
Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 39 paintings in the palace that day, and then 661 visitors came to see them, if there were 600 visitors the previous day, how many more visitors came to see the paintings that day compared to the previous day?  To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of visitors from one day to the next. So, the difference between 600 and 661 is 61 visitors. Therefore, 61 visitors came to see the paintings at Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day.
"Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 92 visitors that day, then the number of people who visited the palace the previous day must be... (more)

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 92 visitors that day, then the number of people who visited the palace the previous day must be... (more)

If 419 people visited the palace the day before and 103 people visited the day before that, then the total number of people who visited the palace in the two days is... (calculate)

So, the number of people who visited the palace on the day they had a rich meal is... (subtract the number of people who visited the previous day from the total number of people who visited in the two days)"
"Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 512 visitors that day, then the number of people who visited Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days is:

If 471 people visited the previous day, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days would be:

If 808 people visited the previous day, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days would be:"
Response:  If they had a rich meal after visiting Buckingham Palace and there were 705 visitors that day, then the number of visitors in the previous two days would be: 191 + 457 = 648 visitors. So, if there were 457 visitors the day before and 191 visitors the day before that, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 245 days would be: 648 - 457 = 191 visitors. Therefore, there were 191 more visitors to Buckingham Palace than during the previous 245 days.
"Response:  If there are 628 grams of sugar needed to make 159 grams of cotton candy, then we need to calculate how many grams of sugar are in each gram of cotton candy. To do this, we divide the total amount of sugar (628 grams) by the weight of one gram of cotton candy (159 grams). This gives us:

Grams of sugar per gram of cotton candy = 628 g / 159 g = 3.84 g
So, for every gram of cotton candy, there are approximately 3.84 grams of sugar. Therefore, if he already has 10 grams of cotton candy (which is equal to 38.4 grams of sugar), he has more than enough sugar to make 159 grams of cotton candy."
Response:  We know that he needs 49 g of color to paint all the things in his checklist. He has already used 260 g of paint, so he still needs 231 g (49 - 260 = 231). Therefore, there are already 75 grams of paint left over (260 - 231 = 75).
Response:  The person needs 57 grams of color to dye their hair, and they have already dyed it with 22 grams of color. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is 57 - 22 = 35 grams. Since the person has 353 grams of hair, they already have more than enough to cover the required amount of 35 grams. So, the answer is Yes, the person already has enough hair dye to complete the task.
Response:  If there are currently 20 g of sugar in the hair, and 166 g of sugar is needed to stick it together, then we need an additional 146 g (166 - 20) of sugar. Therefore, we need 146 g more sugar.
"Response:  If we have 557 grams of this substance and only need 17 grams, then we can calculate how much of it is needed as follows:

$$ \text{Needed amount} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{ \text{Required amount}} $$

Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Needed amount} &= \frac{557}{17} \\ &= 32.8 \text{ grams} \end{aligned} $$
Therefore, we need approximately 32.8 grams of this substance to fulfill our requirement of 17 grams."
Response:  If he has 11g of hair and needs 492g in total, then he needs an additional amount equal to 381g (492g - 11g). Therefore, he needs 381g more hair.
Response:  If there are 94 people who can pick 90 bunches of grapes in 6 days, that means each person can pick 1.07 (90/94) bunches per day. Therefore, one person can pick 107 bunches of grapes in one day.
"Response:  If it takes 5 days to harvest 90 bunches of grapes with 266 pickers working per day, then we can calculate the number of bunches each picker can collect in one day as follows:
Number of pickers = Total number of bunches / Number of days to harvest
= 266 / 5
= 53.2 bunches/day
Now, let's convert this amount into how many wine barrels they can fill in one day:
Wine barrel size = Approximately 120 liters (Note: This is just an estimate and may vary depending on the winery.)
To calculate the number of wine barrels filled per day, we need to divide the total number of bunches collected by the wine barrel size:
Number of wine barrels filled/day = Total number of bunches collected / Wine barrel size
= 53.2 bunches/day x 120 liters/wine barrel
= 6,478 liters/day or approximately 6,500 wine barrels/day
Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, the group of 266 pickers can fill around 6,500 wine barrels in one day."
"Response:  If there are 294 pickers who can collect 244 bunches of grapes per day and 47 bunches of raspberries per day, then in total they can collect:

Grapes: 244 x 294 = 68,536 bunches of grapes per day
Raspberries: 47 x 294 = 13,608 bunches of raspberries per day

Therefore, over a period of 146 days, they can collect:

Grapes: 68,536 x 146 = 9,634,384 bunches of grapes
Raspberries: 13,608 x 146 = 1,933,456 bunches of raspberries

So, in total, they can collect around 11,567,838 bunches of grapes and raspberries during this period."
"Response:  If 235 pickers work for 77 days and each of them picks 100 raspberries and 221 grapes per day, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of raspberries picked in 77 days.
Total number of raspberries = Number of pickers x Number of raspberries per picker x Days worked
= 235 x 100 x 77
= 16,925 raspberries

Step 2: Calculate the total number of grapes picked in 77 days.
Total number of grapes = Number of pickers x Number of grapes per picker x Days worked
= 235 x 221 x 77
= 16,487 grapes

Therefore, over the course of 77 days, the group of 235 pickers would have picked a total of 33,412 fruits (16,925 raspberries + 16,487 grapes)."
"Response:  If there are 252 workers who can collect 108 boxes of grapes per day, and they work for 58 days, then we can calculate the total number of boxes of grapes that will be collected as follows:

Total number of working days = 58 days
Number of workers x Number of boxes collected per day = 252 workers x 108 boxes/day = 26,944 boxes/day
Total number of boxes collected = Total number of working days x Number of boxes collected per day = 58 days x 26,944 boxes/day = 1,536,320 boxes
Therefore, in 58 days, the workers will collect approximately 1,536,320 boxes of grapes."
"Response:  If it takes 36 workers 8 hours to harvest 1 ton of grapes, then... (1)

Solution:
Let's think step by step.  If it takes 36 workers 8 hours to harvest 1 ton of grapes, then:

(1) 36 workers can harvest 8 tons of grapes in 1 day.

Therefore, to harvest 240 tons of grapes, they would need:

(2) 240 / 8 = 30 days

So, it would take 30 days for 36 workers to harvest 240 tons of grapes."
Response:  We know that Mr. Lee has 26 aquariums and each aquarium contains 52 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish in all 26 aquariums is: 26 x 52 = 1320 fish. So there are 1320 fish in all the aquariums.
Response:  We know that the person has 40 mares of fish in different aquariums. Each aquarium contains 2 fish. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of fish / Number of fish per aquarium  In this case, the total number of fish is 40 (since there are 40 mares), and the number of fish per aquarium is 2 (since each aquarium contains 2 fish). Now, let's substitute these values into the equation: Number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 Therefore, the person has 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Tylor has 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium contains an average of 39 animals (some may have more or fewer). Therefore, the total number of animals owned by Tylor is: 56 x 39 = 2274 saltwater animals + 10 x 39 = 390 freshwater animals = 2664 animals in total.
Response:  We know that Tylor has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Each aquarium can hold 46 animals, so...  Therefore, Tyler has altogether 3580 animals (74 x 46) + 912 animals (22 x 46).  So, Tyler has 4502 animals in total.
Response:  We know that Mr. Kim has 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium contains 19 animals. Therefore, the total number of animals is: 15 x 19 = 285 (for saltwater animals) + 62 x 19 = 1138 (for freshwater animals) = 1423 animals in total.
Response:  If she buys 13 white t-shirts at once, then she has 39 - 13 = 26 left. So, she will have 26 white t-shirts left after buying 39 of them.
Response:  If there are 66 white t-shirts and each package contains 3 white t-shirts, then we have: Number of packages = Total number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts in each package = 66 / 3 = 22 packages. Therefore, there will be 22 packages.
"Response:  If there are 28 packages and each package contains 5 white t-shirts, then...

Answer: 28 x 5 = 140

So, there are 140 white t-shirts in total."
Response:  If she buys 53 white t-shirts and then her mother buys 57 more white t-shirts, in total they have 100 white t-shirts (53 + 57 = 100). Now, if her mother also buys 34 pairs of white pants, that means they have 34 + 100 = 134 white clothing items in total. Therefore, they will have 134 white t-shirts and pants combined.
"Response:  If she bought 51 white t-shirts and can sell them in groups of 3 each, then...

Answer: She can sell 17 groups of t-shirts (51 / 3 = 17)."
Response:  If mom buys all 70 white t-shirts at once, then each package will contain 70/14 = 5 shirts. So, there are 5 shirts in each package.
Response:  If there are 4 bags and each bag contains an equal number of cookies, then the total number of cookies is 36 (the sum of the numbers in the question). Since each bag contains an equal number of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 4 to find out how many cookies each bag contains. So, each bag contains 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9).
"Response:  If there are 33 cookies in total and each bag contains 11 cookies, then we have:

Total number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag = 33 / 11 = 3 bags

So, there are 3 bags of cookies."
"Response:  If there are 41 cookies in each of the 5 bags and 53 total cookies, then we can calculate the number of cookies in each bag as follows:

Number of cookies per bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags
= 53 / 5
= 10.6 (round up to 11)

So, each bag contains approximately 11 cookies."
Response:  Since there are 7 bags and each bag can hold at most 2 cookies, we have: Total number of cookies = Number of bags x Maximum number of cookies per bag = 7 x 2 = 14 cookies. Therefore, each bag contains 2 cookies.
Response:  Since there are 3 cookies in each bag and we have 21 bags in total, the number of cookies is calculated as follows: Total number of cookies = Number of bags x Number of cookies per bag Total number of cookies = 21 x 3 = 63 Cookies So, there are 63 cookies in total.
Response:  We know that there are 26 bags and each bag contains an equal number of cookies. So, the total number of cookies in all the bags is 26 x 26 = 676 cookies. Now, we also know that out of these 676 cookies, 15 are chocolates and remaining are candies. Therefore, the number of candies (cookies - chocolates) is 676 - 15 = 661 cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 14 bags of cookies and each bag contains the same amount of cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 14 x = = 1960 cookies. Now, we have 28 bags of chocolates and each bag contains 86 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of chocolates is 28 x = = 2376 chocolates. Since we started with 1960 cookies and ended up with 2376 chocolates, we must have had 434 cookies left over after distributing all the chocolates among the bags ( = 1960 - 2376). Therefore, there were 434 cookies in 14 bags.
Response:  If each block has 5 trash mails and there are $n$ blocks in total, then the number of trash mails sent to each block is $\frac{5}{n}$. Since there are $m$ houses in each block, the number of trash mails sent to each house is $\frac{5}{m}$. Therefore, the number of houses that receive at least one trash mail is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{5}{m}$, which is equal to $\frac{5n}{m}$. So, there are $\frac{5n}{m}$ houses in each block that receive at least one trash mail.
"Response:  If there are 1 block with 20 houses and each house receives 9 trash mails, then...

Answer:  The number of trash mails sent per block is 9 x 20 = 180 trash mails."
"Response:  If there are 6 houses in one block and each house receives 24 pieces of trash mail from the post office, then...

1. The total number of trash mailpieces received by all 6 houses is 6 x 24 = 144.

So, to determine how many trash mailpieces should be delivered to each house, we need to divide the total number of trash mailpieces by the number of houses, which is 6. Therefore, each house will receive 144 / 6 = 23.67 trash mailpieces on average."
Response:  If one person sends 14 convenience emails to each of the houses in a block, and the block has $n$ houses, then the total number of emails sent is $\text{14n}$.  Since the post office requires the sender to send at least $2n$ junk emails to each block, we have $\text{14n} \geq 2n$.  Therefore, there are at most $14n - 2n = 12n$ houses in each block.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in one block and each house receives 32 pieces of trash mail from the postman, then...

1. The total number of trash mails sent to all blocks is 20 x 32 = 640.
2. Since there are 10 blocks in total, the total number of trash mails sent to all blocks is 640 x 10 = 6,400."
Response:  Since there are 78 blocks in total and each block has 30 pieces of trash mail to send out, we need to calculate how many pieces of trash mail each block can send out.  If there are 19 houses in one block, then each house will receive $X$ number of pieces of trash mail, where $X$ is the number of remaining pieces of trash mail after sending out 30 pieces per block. Therefore, the number of pieces of trash mail sent out from each block is: $\boxed{30 - \frac{19}{78} = 21}$. So, the number of pieces of trash mail sent out from each block is $21$.
Response:  If there are 55 blocks and each block has 8 trash mailbags, then the total number of trash mailbags is 55 x 8 = 440.  Now, if he sends 32 mails to each house in a block, then the total number of houses in all blocks is 440 / 32 = 13.67 blocks. So, there will be approximately 13-14 blocks with houses.
Response:  If there are 81 blocks and each block has 4 trash mail deliveries, then we have a total of 81 x 4 = 324 trash mail deliveries to make.  Now, if 12 houses are in each block, then the number of houses in all 81 blocks is 81 x 12 = 972 houses. So, the person will have to deliver trash mail to 972 houses in total.
Response:  If there are 16 blocks and each block has 4 trash mailbags to send, then we need to send a total of 16 x 4 = 64 trash mailbags.  However, if there are 17 houses in one block, then we need to send an additional 17 x 4 = 68 trash mailbags. Therefore, the final answer is 64 + 68 = 132 trash mailbags.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles. If she divides each egg into 4 parts and each marble into 2 parts, then... (1) The number of groups of eggs is equal to the number of groups of marbles, since they are divided equally. So, we have... (2) Number of groups of eggs = Number of groups of marbles = 20 / 2 = 10 groups. Therefore, there will be 10 groups of eggs and 10 groups of marbles after Rebecca divides them.
Response:  Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs. If she divides them into groups of 5 marbles each, how many groups can she make? We need to divide 10 by 5, which gives us 2 groups. Similarly, if she divides the eggs into groups of 3 each, how many groups can she make? We need to divide 15 by 3, which also gives us 2 groups. Therefore, Rebecca can make 2 groups of marbles and 2 groups of eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 11 groups of eggs and each group contains 2 eggs. So, in total, Rebecca has 11 x 2 = 22 eggs. Therefore, Rebeka has 22 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and wants to divide them into 4 groups. So, each group will have how many eggs?  The answer is 2 eggs per group. Now, let's count the number of beads in each group. Since there are 6 beads in total, we can distribute them equally among the 4 groups. Therefore, each group will have 1.5 beads (6/4 = 1.5).
Response:  Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. We want to divide them into three groups. How many eggs will each group have?  Group 1: 4 marbles x 3 groups = 12 marbles Group 2: 15 eggs / 3 groups = 5 eggs per group Group 3: 5 eggs per group x 3 groups = 15 eggs So, each group will have 15 eggs.
Response:  Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 3 or 4 eggs each. Since she can make 3 groups with 18 eggs, there will be 6 groups in total. Now, let's count how many bananas and coins Rebecca has. She has 72 bananas and 66 coins. So, altogether, Rebecca has 6 + 72 + 66 = 144 items. Therefore, there are 144 groups that Rebecca can make.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. Each group of 3 bananas requires 1 egg to make a smoothie. So, we need 9 eggs / 3 = 3 groups of eggs. Now, each group of 3 bananas can be divided into 3 parts, so we have 3 x 3 = 9 groups of bananas. Therefore, there are 9 + 3 = 12 groups in total.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles.  If she divides the eggs into groups of 5 each, how many groups can she make?  She can make 20 / 5 = 4 groups of eggs. Now, let's count the number of marbles in each group. There are 6 marbles in total, so there will be 6 / 5 = 1 marble in each group. Therefore, Rebecca has 4 groups of eggs with 1 marble in each group, which means she has a total of 4 x 1 = 4 marbles.
Response:  Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she divides the marbles into groups of 20 each, how many groups can she make?  Since there are 5 marbles in total, she can make 5 x 20 = 100 groups. Now, let's count the number of eggs she has left after making these groups. She had 12 eggs initially, but now she has only 12 - (100 x 20) = 6 eggs left. So, Rebecca has 6 eggs left.
Response:  If Luke got 154 points in total and he scored 11 points per round, then we can calculate the number of rounds as follows: Number of rounds = Total score / Score per round = 154 / 11 = 14 rounds So, Luke played for 14 rounds.
Response:  If Luke scored 46 points in each round, he would have scored a total of 177 x 46 = 8020 points in all rounds combined.
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points in total and played 2 rounds of trivia games, then he must have scored an average score per round. Since each round consists of 10 questions, we can calculate the average score per question as follows: $ \frac{84}{2} = 42 $ points per round. Therefore, Luke scored $ 42 $ points per round.
Response:  If Luke gets 146 points every round, and he plays 157 rounds, then in total, he will get... (calculate)...points!
Response:  If Luke scored 78 points in total in the Trivia game and he got 3 points per round, then we can calculate the number of rounds as follows: Number of rounds = Total score / Score per round = 78 / 3 = 26 rounds So, Luke played 26 rounds in the Trivia game.
Response:  Emily has two marbles and can make 32 pendants. To find out how many pendants she needs for each marble, we divide the number of pendants by the number of marbles: 32 / 2 = 16 pendants per marble. Therefore, Emily needs 16 marbles to make one pendant.
"Response:  Emily has created 11 pendants and each pendant contains 28 beads. Therefore, the total number of beads that Emily has is:

11 x 28 = 308

So, Emily has 308 beads in total."
Response:  Emily has 8 pearls for her friends and she wants to make more pendants for them. So, she needs 16 - 8 = 8 more pearls. Therefore, Emily can make 8 more pendants.
Response:  Emily has 18 beads and can make 6 necklaces. To find out how many beads each necklace requires, we need to divide the total number of beads (18) by the number of necklaces she can make (6). So, each necklace requires 3 beads (18 / 6 = 3).
Response:  Emily has made 5 pendants with 5 beads each, so she has a total of 25 beads. Since she has already made 4 necklaces, that means she has 25 - 4 = 21 beads left. Therefore, Emily has 21 beads in total.
Response:  Emily has 72 friends and she wants to make bracelets for each of them using 6 beads per bracelet. Since there are 3 beads in each mold, Emily can make 3 x 72 = 216 bracelets in total. Therefore, Emily can make 216 bracelets.
Response:  Emily has 5 pearls and wants to make 20 necklaces. To calculate how many pearls each necklace requires, we need to divide the total number of pearls (5) by the number of necklaces she can make (20). So, each necklace requires approximately 0.67 pearls (5 / 20 = 0.67).
Response:  Emily has created 44 friendship bracelets for her friends and she has made 26 different types of knots. Each type of knot requires two beads to complete it. So, in total, Emily must have used 2 x 26 = 52 beads to make all the friendship bracelets. Therefore, Emily had 52 beads in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children who went to camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than those who went to camp, we can subtract these two numbers: 819058 - 668278 = 150777. Therefore, there are 150777 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp.
"Response:  According to the passage, there were 20,2958 children who went to camp and 77,7622 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than those who went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children staying at home:

Number of children staying at home - Number of children going to camp = 77,7622 - 20,2958 = 57,4634
Therefore, there were 57,4634 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in Lawrence County.  During summer vacation, 629424 children go to camp. So, how many children stay at home? To find out, we need to subtract the number of children who go to camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County. Therefore, the number of children who stay at home is: 898051 - 629424 = 268627.
Response:  Since there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County, and during summer vacation, 274,865 children are at home, that means 38,608 children (313,473 - 274,865) are not at home. Therefore, the number of children who go to camp is 38,608.
Response:  We know that out of 907611 children in Lawrence County, 455682 are going to camp. So, we need to find out how many children are left behind. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County: 907611 - 455682 = 451939. Therefore, there are 451939 children left behind in Lawrence County.
"Response:  If there are 800059 children who go to camp in Lawrence County, and the total number of children in Lawrence County is 828521, then we can calculate the percentage of children who do not go to camp as follows:

Percentage of children who do not go to camp = (Total number of children - Number of children who go to camp) / Total number of children x 100%
= (828521 - 800059) / 828521 x 100%
= 4.76%
Therefore, approximately 4.76% of the children in Lawrence County do not go to camp."
Response:  We know that out of 61619 children in Lawrence County, 30% went to camp. So, how many children remained at home?  Number of children remaining at home = Total number of children x Percentage who did not go to camp  Number of children remaining at home = 91676 x 70% (since 30% went to camp)  Number of children remaining at home = 64528  Therefore, out of 91676 children in Lawrence County, 64528 remained at home while 27158 went to camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of 57,330 children in Lawrence County, 3,4044 went to camp and 13,4867 stayed at home. So, the number of children who attended camp is 3,4044. Now, let's find out how many children were outside of Lawrence County. According to the passage, 424944 children from other counties attended camp. Therefore, the total number of children who attended camp is 424944 + 34044 = 469088.
"Response:  According to the passage, there were 610769 children who went to camp and 590796 children who stayed at home in Lawrence County during summer vacation. Additionally, 22 children from outside the county attended the camp. Therefore, the total number of children in Lawrence County is:  Total number of children = Number of children who went to camp + Number of children who stayed at home + Number of children from outside the county  Total number of children = 610769 + 590796 + 22  Total number of children = 683087
Therefore, there are approximately 683087 children in Lawrence County."
Response:  We know that out of 644997 children in Lawrence County, 893835 children went to camp. So, the number of children who stayed at home is 644997 - 893835 = 551062 children. Therefore, there are 551062 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  Adam has 3 more apples than Jack, so Adam has 3 + 9 = 12 apples in total. Therefore, Jack has 9 - 12 = -3 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jack has 2 apples. So, Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 apples more than Jack. Therefore, Adam has 8 apples more than Jack.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jack has 10 apples in total. So, if Jack has more apples than Adam, then Jack must have at least 1 apple more than Adam. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jack has and the number of apples Adam has is 1.  Hence, Jack has 11 apples (10 + 1 = 11).
Response:  Jack has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. So, if Jack has more apples than Adam, then Jack must have at least 2 more apples than Adam. Therefore, the answer is 12 (Jack has 10 + 2 = 12 apples).
Response:  Adam and Jack have 6 apples between them. If they combined their apples, they would have 10 apples (6 + 6). So, there are 4 more apples than what Adam and Jack have (10 - 6 = 4). Therefore, Adam and Jack have 4 apples each.
Response:  Adam and Jack have 7 apples between them. If there are 9 more apples than they have, then the total number of apples is 9 + 7 = 16. So, Adam and Jack have 16 apples in total.
Response:  Adam and Jack have together 12 apples. If Adam has 8 more apples than Jack, then Jack has 4 apples. So, in total, Adam has 12 + 8 = 20 apples, and Jack has 4 apples. Therefore, the number of apples that Adam has is 20, and the number of apples that Jack has is 4.
Response:  Adam has 4 more apples than Jack, and Jack has 10 apples in total. So, Adam has 14 apples (4 + 10). Therefore, Adam has 7 apples more than Jack.
Response:  Adam has more apples than Jack, so he must have at least 30 apples (since Jack only has 11). Therefore, Adam has at most 40 apples (since he cannot have more than the total number of oranges and apples that Jack has). So, Adam has between 30 and 40 apples.

Response:  According to the passage, Katy has 62 new games and 80 old games, for a total of 142 games. Her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, for a total of 114 games. So, among the three of them, they have a total of 256 games (142 + 114). Therefore, they have more than 30 old games.
Response:  According to the question, Keity has 63 games for Nintendo DS and her friends have played 57 games in total. So, we can say that Keity has more games than her friends by 6 (63 - 57 = 6). Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  According to the information given in the passage, Keity has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, the total number of new games among both is 57 + 34 = 91. Now, we need to find out how many more games Keity has than her friends. To do this, we subtract the number of new games her friends have from the number of new games Keity has: 91 - 34 = 57. Therefore, Keity has 57 more games than her friends.
Response:  Fred had $60 last week and Jason had $19. After Jason washed his car over the weekend, he now has $33. So, the amount of money that Jason earned from washing his car is: $33 - $19 = $14.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $86 and Jason had $5. After Fred washed his car over the weekend, he now has $90, and Jason didn't work. So, currently, Fred has $90 + $5 = $95, and Jason has $0. Therefore, the total amount of money they have between them is $95.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. After washing their cars on Saturday, Fred got $40 more, so he now has $59 ($19 + $40). Jason also got $69 more after washing his car, so he now has $85 ($16 + $69). Therefore, Fred made $30 more than Jason last week ($59 - $85 = $30).
Response:  Last week, Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. After washing their cars over the weekend, Fred now has $21, and Jason has $78. So, Jason made $56 ($78 - $22) during the weekend.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $111 and Jason had $40. After Fred did laundry over the weekend, he now has $115, and Jason has $44 left. So, in total, they earned $73 ($115 - $44) from doing laundry.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $49 last week and did laundry for $112, so he now has $161 ($49 + $112). Secondly, Jason had $3 initially and earned $63 from delivering newspapers, so he now has $96 ($3 + $63). Therefore, the total amount of money earned through newspaper delivery is $161 (Fred) + $96 (Jason) = $257.
Response:  Fred had $78 last week and now has $90 after washing his car over the weekend. Jason had $31 last week and now has $14 after delivering newspapers. So, in total, they have earned $124 ($90 + $31 + $14).
Response:  Fred had $33 last week and spent $16 on newspaper delivery. So he has $17 left ($33 - $16). Then, he spent $74 on laundry. Therefore, Fred has $91 left ($17 + $74). Jason had $95 last week and spent nothing. So, Jason still has $95.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $47 and Jason had $99.  Then, Fred did some deliveries for newspapers and made $111, and also washed a car and earned $34. So, how much money does Fred have now?  We can calculate it as follows:  Fred's initial amount + Newspaper delivery earnings + Car washing earnings = Total amount of money Fred has now.  Therefore, Fred has $47 + $111 + $34 = $182 in total.
Response:  If Jesse started losing weight at 71 kg and lost 20 kg, then his current weight is... (calculate)...51 kg!
Response:  Before starting to jog every day, she weighed 27 kg. After jogging for 101 kilograms, her weight decreased by that amount. So, before jogging, her weight was: 27 + (101 - 27) = 59 kg.
Response:  Before starting to diet, Jesse weighed 126 kg. After dieting for 3 months, he lost 66 kg, so his current weight is 66 kg. Therefore, Jesse's original weight before starting to diet was 192 kg (126 kg - 66 kg).
Response:  Firstly, we know that she lost 35 kg after starting to diet every day. So her initial weight was 69 kg + 35 kg = 104 kg. Therefore, her current weight is 104 kg - 35 kg = 79 kg.
Response:  If he lost 50 kg in the first week and then gained back 60 kg in the second week, his current weight would be:  Initial weight = 114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg + 60 kg = 124 kg So, his current weight is 124 kg.
Response:  Before starting to exercise, Jesse weighed 9 kg. In the first week, he lost 62 kg, and in the second week, he lost another 140 kg. Therefore, his weight before exercising was: 9 + (62 - 62) = 9 + (-62) = 31 kg.
Response:  First week, he lost 56 kg, so his weight after one week is $56 kg + 92 kg = 148 kg$. In the second week, he gained 99 kg, so his weight after two weeks is $148 kg + 99 kg = 247 kg$.
Response:  If there are 95 snakes and 61 alligators in one cave, then we know that the total number of animals in the cave is 95 + 61 = 156.  Now, if there were 64 snakes hiding in the cave, then we can deduce that there are 64 - 95 = -31 snakes who did not hide. So, there are actually 31 more snakes than what was initially mentioned. Therefore, the answer is 31.
Response:  If there are 93 snakes and 97 alligators in one cave, then we know that 93 + 97 = 190 animals are inside the cave.  Now, if 40 of these alligators are hiding, then we can subtract them from the total number of animals to find out how many alligators are not hidden: 190 - 40 = 150 alligators. Therefore, there are 150 alligators that are not hidden in the cave.
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 alligators in one cave. If we assume that all of them are hiding, then the number of alligators not hidden is equal to the total number of alligators minus the number of alligators in the cave. So, if we have 82 snakes and 19 alligators, then the number of alligators not hidden is:  Number of alligators not hidden = Total number of alligators - Number of alligators in the cave = 19 + 75 = 94 Therefore, there are 94 alligators not hidden in the cave.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total living in the cave. Among them, 24 snakes and 51 lizards. So, if we subtract the number of snakes (24) from the total number of animals (79), we get:  $79 - 24 = 55$ animals left. Therefore, there were 55 other animals besides snakes and lizards living in the cave.
"Response:  If there were initially 171 tomatoes and today there are 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes left, then we can calculate how many tomatoes have been picked since yesterday as follows:

Tomatoes picked = Total tomatoes - Tomatoes left today
= 171 - 164
= 7

So, 7 tomatoes have been picked since yesterday."
Response:  Yesterday, there were 160 tomatoes and today, 56 + 41 = 97 tomatoes were picked. So, after picking tomatoes yesterday, there were 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left.
Response:  Yesterday, there were 90 tomatoes in the garden. If he picked 154 yesterday and today he picked 50 each day, then the total number of tomatoes picked = (yesterday + today) - initial amount = 154 + 2 x 50 = 304. So, the remaining tomatoes are 60 (304 - 90).
"Response:  If there are 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes initially, then after collecting 172 potatoes, we have:

Tomatoes: 175 - 172 = 3
Potatoes: 77 - 172 = -94
So, there are 3 tomatoes and -94 potatoes left after collecting 172 potatoes."
Response:  If the farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes initially, then after he took out 53 tomatoes, he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he had 12 potatoes initially, then after taking out 53 potatoes, he has 12 - 53 = -39 potatoes left (since negative numbers are used to represent amounts less than zero). Therefore, there are 124 tomatoes and -39 potatoes left.
"Response:  If there were initially 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, then after sorting out 137 tomatoes, we have:

Green tomatoes left = Initial number of green tomatoes - Number of green tomatoes sorted out = 105 - 137 = -32
Red tomatoes left = Initial number of red tomatoes - Number of red tomatoes sorted out = 71 - 137 = -66
So, there are 32 green tomatoes and -66 red tomatoes left."
Response:  If John uses 4 buckets to cut a large wooden board into smaller pieces, and each bucket requires 2 pieces of wood, then we can calculate the number of buckets needed as follows: Number of buckets = Total length of wooden board / Length of one piece of wood = 10 meters / 5 meters = 2 buckets So, John needs 2 buckets to cut the entire wooden board.
"Response:  We know that John used 13 large wooden boards to build his wall and each board requires 17 nails to fix it in place. So, the total number of nails needed is:

13 x 17 = 201 nails

However, there are also smaller wooden boards that need 8 nails each for fixing. Therefore, the total number of nails required to build John's wall is:

201 + (8 x 4) = 256 nails

So, John needs 256 nails to build his wall."
"Response:  If he uses 11 buckets to cut the big wooden board into smaller pieces, and each piece needs 3 buckets of water to be fixed, then we need:

Number of buckets = Number of pieces x Required amount of water per piece
= 11 x 3
= 33 buckets

So, John needs 33 buckets of water to fix the wall with the big wooden board."

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.
Answer: Let's think step by step. If John used 12 big planks and 10 small planks to build the wall, then he needs... See full solution"
Response:  Since John used 16 panels to cover his wall and each panel requires two screws, he needs to drill 8 holes for each panel. Therefore, in total, John needs to drill 128 holes (16 panels x 8 holes per panel).
Response:  If each wooden panel requires 74 pots to fill it up, and John has used 8 panels in total, then he needs 8 x 74 = 592 pots of soil to fill all the panels.
Response:  We know that John used 12 big planks and 17 small planks to build the wall. Each big plank requires 14 nails, and each small plank requires 25 nails. So, in total, how many nails did John use to build the wall?  To find out, we can multiply the number of big planks by the number of nails required per big plank, and then add that result to the product of the number of small planks and the number of nails required per small plank.  Using this method, we get: Number of nails = (12 x 14) + (17 x 25) = 168 + 4350 = 4518 nails Therefore, John used 4518 nails to build the wall.
Response:  We know that Robin has 42 pieces of candy in total. Each package contains 3 pieces of candy, so there are 14 packages (42 / 3 = 14). Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of candy.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages and each package contains 23 pieces. So, in total, Robin has 43 x 23 = 1007 pieces. Now, we are asked how many more pieces Robin has than he had initially. To find this out, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away (8) from the initial number of pieces he had: 1007 - 8 = 999. Therefore, Robin has 999 more pieces than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Robin has 7 pieces of each package and he has 6 more packages than Alice. So, in total, Robin has 7 x 9 = 63 pieces of candy. Since there are 41 pieces of candy in each package, Robin has 63 / 41 = 1.52 packages of candy. Therefore, Robin has 1.52 packages of candy.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pieces of candy and each package contains 4 pieces. So, how many packages does Robin have?  To find out, we can divide the total number of candies (28) by the number of pieces in each package (4): 28 / 4 = 7 packages. Therefore, Robin has 7 packages of candy.
Response:  Robin has 21 packages of candy and each package contains 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, Robin has in total... 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of candy. So, Robin has 189 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pieces of candy and each package contains 6 pieces. So, how many packages does Robin have?  To find out, we can divide the total number of candies (28) by the number of pieces in each package (6): 28 / 6 = 4 packages. Therefore, Robin has 4 packages of candy.
Response:  If an industrial machine can produce 3 shirts per minute, and it has produced a total of 6 shirts, then we need to calculate how long it took for the machine to produce those 6 shirts. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so if the machine worked for x hours, it would have produced 6 x 3 = 18 shirts. Therefore, the machine worked for x/60 = 18/60 = 3 hours.
"Response:  If the industrial machine can produce 4 shirts per minute and it worked for 5 minutes, then...

Answer: The industrial machine produced 20 shirts (4 x 5 = 20)."
"Response:  Yesterday, you made 9 shirts in total. Today, you plan to make 44 shirts. If you can produce 3 shirts per minute, then...

Please fill in the blank with the appropriate number."
"Response:  If we made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 today, that means we have a total of 16 shirts produced so far. Since we can produce 8 shirts per minute, it took us:

Minutes = Number of shirts / Number of shirts per minute
= 16 / 8
= 2 minutes

Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes to produce 16 shirts."
"Response:  If yesterday Industry Machine made 9 shirts and today it made 8 shirts, then we can calculate the number of shirts produced per minute as follows:

Production rate yesterday = Number of shirts produced yesterday / Time taken to produce one shirt yesterday
= 9 / x (where x is the time taken to produce one shirt)

Production rate today = Number of shirts produced today / Time taken to produce one shirt today
= 8 / y (where y is the time taken to produce one shirt today)

Since we are given that Industry Machine can produce 2 shirts per minute, we can find out how many minutes it worked today by dividing the total number of shirts produced today by its production rate:

Total number of shirts produced today = Production rate today × Total time taken to produce shirts today
= 8 × (x + y)

Now, we know that the total time taken to produce shirts today is equal to the sum of the time taken to produce each shirt yesterday and today:

Time taken to produce shirts today = Time taken to produce shirts yesterday + Time taken to produce shirts today
= x + y

Substituting the values we have obtained so far, we get:

Time taken to produce shirts today = (9 + 8) = 17

Therefore, Industry Machine worked for 17 minutes today."
Response:  If an industrial machine can produce 3 shirts per minute and yesterday it produced 4 shirts, then it has produced a total of 4 x 60 = 240 shirts in one day.  If today it produces 8 times as many shirts (i.e., 8 x 60 = 480 shirts), then the total number of shirts produced by the machine in two days is 240 + 480 = 720 shirts. Therefore, the machine operated for 2 days.
Response:  If an industrial machine can produce 6 shirts per minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday, it produced 72 shirts (6 x 12 = 72). And if it used 14 shirts today, it means that it has produced a total of 86 shirts (72 + 14 = 86) so far.
Response:  If an industrial machine can produce 6 shirts per minute and worked for 5 minutes yesterday, it produced 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). And if it used 12 shirts today, then it produced 12 - 30 = -18 shirts today. So, the number of shirts produced by the machine today is negative 18.
"Response:  The game was played for 5 days and $165 was earned each day. Therefore, the total amount of money earned in one day is:
$165 x 5 = $825
So, the person earned $825 per day."
"Response:  The game was played for 22 days, and $144 per day. So, the total amount of money earned during that time is:
$144 x 22 = $3,088
Therefore, they earned $3,088 during their stay at the carnival."
"Response:  The game was played for 30 days and $420 was earned in total. After playing the game, they got $22. So, the number of days spent playing the game is:

$420 / ($22 + $1 = $419) = 10 days

Therefore, the answer is 10 days."
Response:  The game was played for 54 days (first 44 + remaining 10). During this period, the player earned $382 per day in the first 44 days and $374 per day during the remaining 10 days. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the player is: $382 x 44 = $16,396 + $374 x 10 = $3,740 = $20,136.
Response:  The game was played for 36 days (20 + 16). So, the total amount of money earned from the game is: $120 x 36 = $4320. Therefore, during the first 20 days, the player earned $120 per day, and during the remaining 16 days, they earned $66 per day.
Response:  The game was played for 154 days and earned $325 during that time. Then, it remained for 57 days and earned $114 during that time. So, in total, the game earned $439 ($325 + $114) over the entire period of 211 days (154 + 57).
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 cookies and 4 cakes, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 items. So, Lucy bought more cookies than cakes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 pieces of rice cakes and 22 pieces of cookies in total. Then, we need to find out how many packages of food Lily bought. We can do this by dividing the number of rice cakes and cookies by the number of packages she bought. From the information given, we know that Lily bought 3 packages of food. Therefore, the answer is 4 + 22 = 26 pieces of food per package. So, Lily bought 26 x 3 = 78 packages of food in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy went to the supermarket and bought 23 cookies. Then, she also bought some cakes which are not specified in number. So, the total number of items she purchased is 23 + x, where x represents the number of cakes she bought. Therefore, the answer is 23 + x.
Response:  Lucy went to the supermarket and bought 2 packs of cookies (12 pieces each) and 1 pack of candy (20 pieces). In total, she purchased 32 items. Since she had $56 in change, she could have bought at most $\boxed{32 / 56 = 0.58}$ packs of candy or $\boxed{20 / 56 = 0.36}$ packs of cookies.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry more than 36 people, it means that there are still some people left who haven't gotten on the bus yet. Therefore, the number of people currently on the bus is 16 - 36 = -20 people.
Response:  Firstly, there were 8 people in the bus initially. Then, 12 more people boarded the bus at the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people got off the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people still in the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people who are currently in the bus is: 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people in the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train (첫  Хронологија에는 11人이 탑으로 있었습니다). Then, 8 more people got on the train (그들은 8명이 올려왔어요), so now there are 19 people in the train (지금 기차에는 19人이 타고 있죄요).
"Response:  If there were 22 parents who participated in this program and a total of 676 people attended, then we can calculate the number of students as follows:

Number of students = Total attendance / Number of participating parents
= 676 / 22
= 31
Therefore, 31 students attended the program."
Response:  We know that there are 73 parents who attended the program, and they are included in the total number of participants. Therefore, the total number of participants is:  Participants = Parents + Students + Teachers  = 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531 people participated in the program.
"Response:  If there were 174 parents who participated in the program and 521 students attended the program, then we can calculate the ratio of students to parents as follows:

Students : Parents = 521 : 174 = 3.06
So, approximately 3.06 times more students than parents participated in the program."
"Response:  The program had 61 parents and 177 students participating. If there were 44 seats available in the program, then the number of people who attended the program is:

$$ \text {Number of people attending the program} = \frac{\text{Total number of participants}}{ \text{Number of seats available}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of people attending the program} = \frac{61 + 177}{44}} $$

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get:

$$ x = 258 $$

Therefore, approximately $258$ people attended the program."
"Response:  The depth of the cave is 919 feet and they need to move 1307 feet away from the entrance. So, if we divide the distance they need to move (1307) by the depth of the cave (919), we get:

Distance = 1307 / 919 = 1.42 miles

Therefore, the end of the cave is approximately 1.42 miles away from the entrance."
Response:  If they are currently at 849 feet deep and need to reach a depth of 1218 feet, how long will it take them to get there if they move at a rate of 17 feet per minute? To find out, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed, where distance is the remaining distance (in this case, 369 feet) and speed is their current moving rate (17 feet/minute). So, time = 369 / 17 = 21.5 minutes. Therefore, it will take them approximately 21.5 minutes to reach the bottom of the cave if they continue moving at a rate of 17 feet per minute.
Response:  If they are already at 659 feet and need to reach the bottom of the cave which is 762 feet deep, then they have to go down an additional 103 feet (762 - 659 = 103).
Response:  At first, there were 8 goldfish in the pond. If the cat lost its way and found 6 goldfish, then the number of goldfish left in the pond would be 8 - 6 = 2. So, 2 goldfish remained in the pond after the cat found them.
Response:  At first, there were 7 mares of goldfish and 12 cats.  If we assume that each cat can eat 3 fish (which is not necessarily true), then the number of fish eaten by the cats would be: 12 cats x 3 fish/cat = 36 fish.  So, initially, 36 fish were consumed.  Now, let's consider how many fish are left after 15 cats have been fed.  Each cat has eaten 3 fish, so altogether, 15 cats have eaten: 15 cats x 3 fish/cat = 45 fish.  Therefore, after feeding all 15 cats, 45 - 36 = 9 fish remain.
"Response:  The page had 16 mice and 71 cats. If we assume that each cat ate one mouse per day (which is a rough estimate), then:

* Day 1: 16 mice x 71 cats = 1146 mice eaten
* Day 2: 15 mice x 70 cats = 1050 mice eaten
*...
* Day n: 13 mice x 69 cats = 857 mice eaten

So, in total, 857 mice were eaten over the course of n days."
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 marbles in the jar and 5 of them were eaten by the hungry cats. So, we have 15 - 5 = 10 marbles left in the jar.
Response:  At first, there were 43 apples. The chef took away two apples and gave them to someone else. So, now there are 41 apples left. Then, he took another apple and gave it to someone else, leaving 40 apples. Finally, he took the last apple and gave it to someone else, so there are no more apples left. Therefore, the number of apples the chef gave away is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.
Response:  If the chef had 58 apples and used only 35 of them to make pies, then how many apples were left unused?  We can solve this problem by subtracting the number of apples used from the total number of apples available: 58 - 35 = 23. So, there were 23 apples left unused.
Response:  If the chef had 40 apples and made 39 pies, then he must have used 1 apple to make each pie. So, he used 1/4 of an apple for each pie. Therefore, he used a total of 40 / 4 = 10 apples to make all the pies.
"Response:  Adam has 11 action figures in each of his shelves, and he has 4 shelves. Therefore, the total number of action figures Adam has is:

$$ \text {Total number of action figures} = 11 \times 4 = 44 $$
So, there are 44 action figures in Adam's room."
Response:  Adam can put 10 action figures in each of the 4 shelves in his room. So, he has 10 x 4 = 40 action figures in total. Therefore, there are 40 action figures in Adam's room.
Response:  Adam can put 8 action figures and 10 cabinets in each of the four shelves in his room. So, he can have a total of 32 action figures (8 x 4) and 40 cabinets (10 x 4).
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 pots of flowers. So, in total, we have 10 x 544 = 5440 pots of flowers. Now, let's assume that each pot contains 32 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 5440 x 32 = 176,880 flowers.
"Response:  We know that there are 466 bowls and each bowl contains either 53 flowers or 181 sticks. So, in total, we have:

Flowers: 53 x 466 = 24,970 flowers
Sticks: 181 x 466 = 86,660 sticks
Therefore, there are 24,970 flowers and 86,660 sticks in total."
Response:  We know that there are 141 bowls and each bowl contains either 71 flowers or 91 sticks. So, in total, we have 141 x (71 + 91) = 141 x 162 = 22,312 flowers and sticks combined. Therefore, there are 22,312 flowers and sticks in total.
Response:  We know that there are 40 flowers in one jar and 400 flowers in total. So, if we divide the number of jars (4) by the number of flowers in each jar (40), we get: Number of jars = 400 / 4 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 jars in total.
Response:  We know that Steven has 4502 skittles in his collection and he wants to divide them into groups of 154 skittles each. So, we need to find out how many groups can be formed using all the skittles.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 4502 by 154, which gives us 29 groups. Therefore, there are 29 groups of skittles in Steven's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 documents. So, we can calculate the number of groups as follows: Number of groups = Total number of documents / Number of skittles per group = 4950 / 3941 = 12 Therefore, each group contains approximately 495 skittles.
Response:  We know that there are 896 skis in Steven's collection and he also has 517 poles and 90 bindings. Since each ski can have multiple poles and bindings, we need to divide these numbers accordingly. For example, if one ski has two poles, then there will be 517 / 2 = 258 pairs of poles for all the skis. Similarly, if one binding can fit multiple skis, then there will be 90 / x (where x is the number of skis) bindings for all the skis. Now, let's group the skis into eight categories based on their length: Short (less than 130 cm), Small (130-140 cm), Medium (140-150 cm), Large (150-160 cm), Extra Large (160-170 cm), XXL (over 170 cm). The total number of skis in each category will be calculated as follows: Short: 258 / 8 = 32 skis Small: 258 / 8 = 32 skis Medium: 258 / 8 = 32 skis Large: 258 / 8 = 32 skis Extra Large: 258 / 8 = 32 skis XXL: 258 / 8 = 32 skis Therefore, there are 32 skis in each of the first six categories and 32 + 32 = 64 skis in the last two categories. So, the total number of skis in each group is: Group 1 (Short): 32 skis Group 2 (Small): 32 skis Group 3 (Medium): 32 skis Group 4 (Large): 32 skis Group 5 (Extra Large): 32 skis Group 6 (XXL): 64 skis In conclusion, there are 32 skis in each of the first six groups and 64 skis in the last two groups, for a total of 32 x 6 = 192 skis in all the groups combined.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes So, there will be 54 classes in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in total and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Total Number of Students = 304 x 75 Total Number of Students = 22,550 students. Therefore, there were approximately 22,550 students in the school.
