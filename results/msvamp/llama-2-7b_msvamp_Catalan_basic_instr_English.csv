Explanation: The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference is:
48 - 11 = 37
Therefore, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter."
Response: 43
"Response: 43
Explanation:
Let's assume that the total number of pages in the book is x. Since the first chapter has 60 pages, we can write:
x = 60 + 93
Now, we know that the second chapter has y pages, where y is the difference between the total number of pages and the number of pages in the first chapter. Therefore, we can write:
y = x - 60
Substituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get:
y = 93 - 60
y = 33
Therefore, the second chapter has 33 pages."
"Response: 29
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of pages in each chapter is x and y respectively. According to the problem statement, the sum of the number of pages of both chapters is equal to the total number of pages of the book which is given as 67. Therefore we can write the equation: x + y = 67. Now since the second chapter has 36 pages, we can substitute this value in the above equation to get x = 31. So the first chapter has 31 pages."

"Response: 40
Explanation:
The first chapter has 53 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:
53 - 21 = 32
So, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter."

Response:  The tree had 74 pomes at the beginning.
"Response: 27
Explanation:  According to the question, Rachel collected 8 pomes from each of her three trees, for a total of 8 x 3 = 24 pomes collected. Since the trees had a total of 9 pomes initially, that means there were 9 - 24 = -15 pomes left on the trees after Rachel collected them. Therefore, there were originally 27 pomes on all three trees (9 + (-15) = 27)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel collected 7 pomes from each of her 4 apple trees, which means she collected a total of 7 x 4 = 28 pomes. Additionally, the question states that after collecting these pomes, the trees still have a total of 29 pomes left on them. Therefore, in total, Rachel collected 28 + 29 = 57 pomes."

Explanation: Let's assume that there are x number of boys in the school. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, the number of girls is x + 281 = 868 (since the total number of students is 868). Therefore, the number of boys is x = 587."
"Response: 558
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x noises and y girls in the school. Since there are 700 students in total, we can write the equation: x + y = 700. We know that there are 142 more boys than girls, so we can write an additional equation: x - y = 142. Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving them simultaneously, we get: x = 358 and y = 192. Therefore, there are 558 students in the school, including both boys and girls."
Response:  There are currently 938 students in the school (706 + 418).
Response:  There are now 946 girls at the school (902 + 44).
Response:  The number of girls in the school is 632 + 465 = 1097. Therefore, there are more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  There are currently 790 girls in the school (732 + 68).
Response:  There are 135 boys and 135 girls in the school initially. When 496 more girls and 910 more boys join the school, there will be a total of 725 boys (including the initial 135) and 525 girls (including the initial 135). So, there are 290 boys in the school now.

Response: 4961 people (315 girls + 309 boys + 772 teachers)
Response:  There are 337 boys at the school.
"Response: 1370
Explanation:
Let's assume that there are x number of boys in the school. Since there are 458 more girls than boys, the total number of students in the school is x + 458 = 1370."

Response:  The Edward has $2 left.
Response:  $10
"Response:  $23
Explanation:
L'Edward va tenir 23 dollars abans de gastar els diners (9 + 8 = 17)."
"Response:  $84
Explanation:
Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, each book costing him the same amount of money. After buying the books, he had $6 left. To find out how much Edward had before spending the money, we can set up an equation using the information given in the question:

$16 = x (where x is the amount Edward had before spending)

We know that after spending $16, Edward had $6 left, so we can write:

x - $16 = $6

Solving for x, we get:

x = $84

Therefore, Edward had $84 before spending the money."

Response: 28
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, Zachary did 58 flexions and 33 agafadas. If David did 36 more flexions than Zachary, then David did 58 + 36 = 94 flexions. However, David also did 33 fewer agafadas than Zachary, so David did 33 - 33 = 0 agafadas. Therefore, the difference between the number of flexions that Zachary did and the number of agafadas that Zachary did is 58 - 33 = 25."
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the question, Zachary did 5 flexions and 17 agafadas in class today. If David made 27 more flexions than Zachary, then David made 27 + 5 = 32 flexions. However, David also made 7 fewer agafadas than Zachary, so David made 17 - 7 = 10 agafadas. Therefore, the difference between the number of flexions and agafadas that Zachary made is 32 - 10 = 22."

Response: 3 feet (or 90 inches)
"Response: 46
Question:  La muntanya més alta del món és...?
Answer: Mount Everest"
Response: 48 inches
Response:  The ratolín has jumped 30 inches (76 cm) beyond the frog's jump of 25 inches (63 cm). So the rat has jumped 30 - 25 = 5 inches (13 cm) further than the frog.
Response:  The ratolí salted 40 inches beyond the saltell.
"Response: 52 feet

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

* Saltarroca (S) jumped 19 inches.
* Granota (G) jumped 39 inches more than S.
* Ratolí (R) jumped 94 inches less than G.

From this information, we can calculate the distance traveled by the granola as follows:

Distance = Height of Saltarroca + (Height of Granota - Height of Ratolí)
= 19 inches + (39 inches - 94 inches)
= 52 inches

Therefore, the granola jumped 52 inches."
"Response: 10 inches
Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Salt length = 25 + 32 - 26 = 79 inches
Since the ratolí salted less than the granja, we know that the distance traveled by the ratolí is less than 79 inches. Therefore, the answer is 10 inches (since 79 - 10 = 69)."
"Response: 10 inches

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* The saltarroca (El Saltarroca) jumped 24 inches.
* La granota (The Frog) jumped 33 inches more than El Saltarroca.
* El ratolí (The Mouse) jumped 5 inches less than La Granota.

So, if El Saltarroca jumped 24 inches, La Granota jumped 33 + 24 = 57 inches. And if La Granota jumped 57 inches and El Ratolí jumped 5 inches less, then El Ratolí jumped 52 inches.

Therefore, the distance that El Ratolín (The Mouse) jumped was 52 inches."
Response:  The farm jumped 18 feet (4.5 meters).
Response: 79 inches (or 196 cm)

"Response: 9 tasses
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added some farina and needs 8 more tasses of farina than sugar. Since she needs 8 more tasses of farina than sugar, and there are 13 tasses of sugar required in the recipe, we can deduce that Mary needs to add 9 more tasses of farina (13 - 8 = 5)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already put 4 tasses of flour (not specified if it's farina or all-purpose flour) and she needs 2 more tasses of flour than sugar. So, if she needs 7 tasses of sugar, then she will need 5 tasses of flour (7 - 2 = 5)."

"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the passage, ""la majoria"" (most) of the animals are migrating to warmer countries during winter. If 60 families of birds flew away for winter and there were originally 19 families living near the mountain, then the number of families that stayed behind is equal to 19 - 60 = -41. Therefore, 34 families of birds more than those who left migrated to warmer climates for winter."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the passage, ""L'hivern és el moment en què els animals migren cap a països més càlids."" This means that all of the 87 families of birds mentioned in the passage will migrate to warmer climates for the winter. Therefore, none of the 7 families of birds that are mentioned as having flown south for the winter will be left behind. So, the answer is 0 (or 13, since there are 13 families of birds that stayed behind)."
Response: 5 families of birds lived near the mountain at the beginning.
Response: 16 families of birds remained near the mountain.
"Response: 59
Explanation:
The passage states that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain and that 42 families of birds flew to Africa. It also states that 31 families of birds flew to Asia. To find out how many more families of birds flew to Africa than to Asia, we need to subtract the number of families that flew to Asia from the total number of families that flew away (42 - 31 = 11). Therefore, 11 more families of birds flew to Africa than to Asia."
"Response: 156
Explanation:
The passage states that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain and that 47 families of birds flew to Africa. Therefore, the number of families of birds that flew to Asia is equal to the number of families that did not fly to Africa minus the number of families that lived near the mountain. This can be expressed mathematically as:
Number of families that flew to Asia = Number of families that did not fly to Africa - Number of families that lived near the mountain
= 94 - 38
= 56
Therefore, 56 families of birds flew to Asia."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 18 families of birds that live near the mountain. If 38 families of birds flew to Africa and 80 families flew to Asia, then the total number of families of birds that did not fly south for the winter is 18 - (38 + 80) = 24."
Response: 95 families of birds live near the mountain.
Response: 30 families of birds stayed near the mountain.
Response: 34 families of birds remained near the mountain.
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the passage, 86 families of birds flew south for the winter from near a mountain. If there were initially 45 families of birds living near the mountain, then the number of families that flew south for the winter is equal to the number of families that remained behind (45 - 86 = -41). Therefore, 21 more families of birds flew south for the winter than stayed behind."
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 41 families of birds that live near the mountain. If 35 families of birds flew to Asia and 62 families flew to Africa, then the total number of families of birds that flew to Africa is 62 + 35 = 97. Therefore, there are 97 - 41 = 56 more families of birds that flew to Africa than to Asia."
Response: 40 families of birds stayed near the mountain. Explanation: According to the passage, 26 new families of birds moved in from the Arctic while 2 families of birds flew further south for the winter. Therefore, there are 40 families of birds staying near the mountain (26 + 2 = 40).

"Response: 400

Explanation:
According to the question, Paul had 531 llapis of color and 38 goms at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, he only lost 39 goms, which means that he still has 38 goms. Therefore, the number of llapis he had left is:

531 - 39 = 492

So, Paul had 492 llapis of color left at the end of the year."
"Response: 268

Explanation:
Let X be the number of gomes of gum that Paul had at the end of the year. Since he did not lose any gomets, we know that X = 336 - 406 = -70. Therefore, Paul had 70 fewer gomes of gum than crayons at the end of the year."

"Response: 9
Explanation: Let X be the number of clients that the cashier had initially. Since 15 clients left, there are now X - 15 clients. Meanwhile, the cashier gained 14 new clients, so the total number of clients is X + 14 = 9."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 3 customers, and then ""uns quants"" (a few) more customers arrived, bringing the total number of customers to 8. Therefore, 4 new customers have arrived."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
The number of clients initially was 8. After some left, there were 5 clients remaining. Then, the cashier acquired 99 new clients, so the total number of clients now is:
8 + 5 = 13
New clients acquired = 99
Total number of clients = 13

"Response: 23
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had initially two books (2 x 10 = 20). He sold some of them in a garage sale and bought 150 new ones, so he now has 58 books (20 + 150 - 20 = 58). Therefore, he vended 20 books during the garage sale."
"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul initially had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling some, he bought 42 new books, which brings the total number of books he has to 73 (21 + 42).

"Response:  The length of Robin's hair before it was cut is given as 13 inches (or 13 polzades). If it was then cut by some number of centimeters, and we are told that it is now 17 inches long, then we can deduce that the number of centimeters cut from his hair is equal to the difference between the original length and the new length, divided by the original length. In other words:

Number of centimeters cut = (New length - Original length) / Original length
= (17 - 13) / 13
= 4 cm
Therefore, Robin's barber cut 4 centimeters off of his hair."
"Response: 5 feet
Explanation: According to the question, Robin's hair was originally 10 inches long before he cut it by 20 inches. To find out how long his hair was before he cut it, we can divide the original length of his hair (10 inches) by the amount he cut it (20 inches). This gives us a ratio of 10/20 = 0.5 or 5 feet. Therefore, Robin's hair was 5 feet long before he cut it."

"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 5 children on the bus. When they reached the stop number 63, 5 children got off the bus while 2 more got on. Therefore, the total number of children on the bus after reaching the stop was 14 (5 + 2). So, 7 children got on the bus while 7 children got off, resulting in no change in the total number of children on the bus."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 36 children on the bus, and then 68 children got off at the stop while some more got on. Therefore, the number of children left on the bus is 12 (the difference between the initial number of children and the number that got off). So, 9 more children got off the bus than got on."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
Let the number of children who got off the bus be x. Since there were initially 22 children in the bus and 40 children got on the bus while some got off, we can write the equation:
22 + x = 40 - 4
Now, we know that 2 children got off the bus, so we can substitute x = 18 to get:
22 + 18 = 40 - 4
Simplifying, we get:
30 = 36
Therefore, 16 children got off the bus at the stop."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 28 children in the bus. When they reached stop number 82, 4 more children got on the bus while some got off. Therefore, the final number of children in the bus was 30, which is equal to the number that got on the bus minus the number that got off (4)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: Let X be the number of children who got off the bus. Since there were 23 children on the bus initially and 24 children got on at the stop, we have:
X + 23 = 24... (1)
Now, 8 children got off the bus, so the number of children left on the bus is:
X - 8 = 20... (2)
Subtracting (2) from (1), we get:
23 = 20 + 5
So, 5 children got off the bus."

"Response: 33
Explanation: Let x be the number of additional pastries made by the baker after selling 71. Then, the total number of pastries made = 144 + x. The number of pastries sold = 71. So, we can set up the equation: Total number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 33. Therefore, the baker made 33 more pastries than he sold."

Response: 27 more pastries were sold than were bought by the baker.
Response:  The baker still has 7 pastries left (62 + 149 - 144 = 7).
"Response: 55

Explanation:
Let the number of pastries made by the baker be x. Since he has sold 46 pastries, the difference between the number of pastries made and the number of pastries sold is equal to the number of pastries that the baker still has (x - 46).

We are also given that the baker made 81 pastries initially, plus an additional 92 pastries later, for a total of 173 pastries made (81 + 92 = 173). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 46 = 173

"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the question, the panadère made 14 + 153 = 167 pastries. If he sold 8 + 97 = 105 pastries more than he made, then he sold 167 - 105 = 62 pastries."

Therefore, Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response: 11
Explanation: According to the question, Randy used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: 89 - 63 = 26.

Explanation: According to the question, Dave had won 12 entries and used them to buy toys. This means he has 14 - 12 = 7 remaining entries."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Dave had 18 entries and used 5 of them to buy games. This means he has 13 entries left (18 - 5 = 13). Then, he used 11 more entries to buy clothes, which leaves him with 2 entries (13 - 11 = 2) remaining. Therefore, Dave has 2 entries left after buying both games and clothes."
Response: 3
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the passage, Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys and 18 more tickets to buy clothes. Therefore, he used 26 tickets in total for buying both toys and clothes. Since he had 13 tickets initially, he has 13 - 26 = -13 tickets left after buying both toys and clothes."

"Response: 10 - 4 = 6
Explanation:
Haley had 9 trees in her garden before the hurricane. After she died, 4 trees were destroyed by the hurricane. Then, she planted 5 more trees. So, the total number of trees left in her garden is 9 - 4 + 5 = 6."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, after the hurricane, two trees died, leaving six trees alive in Haley's garden. Therefore, the answer is six."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the passage, after the hurricane, 13 trees in Haley's garden died. Initially, 3 trees were planted, so the number of trees that died as a result of the hurricane is 10 (13 - 3)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, after the hurricane, two trees in Haley's garden died. Initially, there were 11 trees planted. Therefore, the number of surviving trees is equal to the number of trees initially planted minus the number of trees that died during the hurricane. In this case, 4 trees survived (11 - 2 = 4)."
"Response: 170

Explanation:
Desprès visits the orange grove and discovers that they collect 66 bags per day. If each bag contains 28 oranges, then the total number of oranges collected per day is:

66 bags/day × 28 oranges/bag = 170 oranges/day"
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: According to the passage, Desprès collects 8 sacs of oranges per day. To collect 24 sacs of oranges, it will take him 3 days, since he needs to collect 3 times 8 = 24 sacs."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the passage, the collection of oranges will last for 4 days. If they collect 56 bags of oranges in total, then they must have collected 14 bags per day (56 / 4 = 14)."
Response:  After 49 days of collection, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1762 sacs of oranges.
Response:  After 87 days of collection, they will have collected 66 x 87 = 5639 taronges.
"Response: 240

Based on the question, what is the approximate number of taronges collected per day?  Approximate answer: 240"
"Response: 2 days
Explanation: According to the passage, Desprès collects 16 sacs of oranges per day, and each sac contains 57 oranges. To calculate how many days it will take to collect 80 sacs of oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges in one sac:

80 sacs / 57 oranges per sac = 14 days
Therefore, it will take Desprès 2 days to collect 80 sacs of oranges."
Response: 35 x 12 = 420
Response:  After 51 days of collection, they will have collected 3690 sacs (74 x 51).
"Response: 120
Explanation:
Desprès visited the place where they were collecting oranges and found out that they collected 76 bags per day and discarded 64 bags. If each bag contains 50 oranges, then the number of oranges collected per day is:
120 (answer) = 76 x 50 / 64
Therefore, the correct answer is 120."
Response:  After 26 days of collection, they will have collected 1304 sacs of oranges (28 x 26 = 728 + 52 x 26 = 1304).
Response:  After 25 days of collection, Desprès will have collected 3079 sacs of mature oranges (82 x 25 = 2050 + 61 x 25 = 1529).
Response:  After 45 days of collection, desprès will have collected 24 x 45 = 1080 sacs of unripe oranges.
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the passage, 44 sacs of mature oranges and 25 sacs of unripe oranges are collected per day. Therefore, the number of more mature than immature oranges collected is:

44 - 25 = 19
So, 19 more mature than immature oranges are collected per day."
"Response: 74
Explanation: According to the passage, 74 sacs of oranges were collected that were not yet ripe. Since it is mentioned that they collect 5 sacs of mature oranges per day, we can conclude that they collect 74 - 5 = 69 more sacs of unripe oranges per day."
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: According to the passage, it took them 3 days to collect 54 bags of oranges. If they collected 18 bags per day, then it would have taken them 54/18 = 3 days to collect all 54 bags."
"Response: 380 bags
Explanation:
To find out how many bags they collected in one day, we need to divide the total number of bags by the number of days they collected them. Since they collected for 14 days, and they collected 56 bags per day, we can calculate the daily bag collection as follows:

56 bags/day × 14 days = 792 bags/week
So, they collected 380 bags in total (792 bags/week x 14 weeks)."
Response:  After 73 days of collection, they will have collected 3650 sacs of mature tomatoes (since they collect 5 sacs per day).
"Response: 290
Explanation:
After 6 days of collection, there will be 290 sacs of unripe tomatoes left, since they collected 65 x 6 = 390 sacs in total and there are already 46 ripe tomatoes collected."
"Response: 57

Explanation:
According to the passage, 86 sacs of mature tomatoes are collected per day. To find out how many more mature tomatoes are collected than immature ones, we need to subtract the number of immature tomatoes collected (41) from the number of mature tomatoes collected. Therefore, the difference between the number of mature and immature tomatoes collected is 86 - 41 = 45. So, 45 more mature tomatoes are collected than immature ones per day."
Response: 71 + 60 = 131 sacs of oranges collected per day.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 4 meters and its width is 3 meters. Therefore, the ratio of the length to the width is 4:3 or 1.33. So, Jesse's room is longer than it is wide by a factor of 1.33.
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is 2 meters = 6 feet = 72 inches. Therefore, the area of the carpet needed is 14 square feet x 72 inches/square foot = 972 square inches.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 8 feet (2 meters x 2 = 4 meters). Therefore, the area of the carpet needed to cover the floor of his room is 14 square feet / 0.125 square meters = 112 square meters.
Response: 12 meters squared.
"Response: 16
Explanation:
The room is 3 meters long and 2.5 meters wide (9 square meters). Since each tile covers 4 square feet, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of one tile to find out how many tiles are needed:
9 square meters / 4 square feet = 2.25 tiles
Since there are 0.25 tiles left over after dividing the area of the room by the area of one tile, we can round up to the nearest whole number of tiles, which is 16. Therefore, Jesse needs 16 tiles to cover the entire floor."
Response: 120 square meters. Explanation: To calculate the total area of all floors in Jesse's house, we need to multiply the length and width of each floor by the number of floors. Since there are 20 floors, the total area is: 6 meters x 6 meters x 20 = 120 square meters.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 6 meters longer than its width, so the ratio of the length to the width is $ \frac{6}{3} = 2$. Therefore, for every meter that the room is wide, it is $ 2$ meters long.
Response:  The width of La Jesse's room is 2 meters.
Response:  The length of La Jesse's room is 2 meters.
"Response: 7 meters squared
Explanation: To determine how much carpeting Jess needs to cover the entire floor, we need to calculate the area of the room. The length of the room is 1 meter and the width is 6 meters, so the area of the room is 1 x 6 = 6 square meters. Since Jess has 6 meters squared of carpeting, he will have enough to cover the entire floor since 6 > 6."
"Response: 467
Explanation: According to the passage, Razorbacks earned $23 for each t-shirt sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. If they sold 230 t-shirts during the game, then they earned a total of $5,190 ($23 x 230). However, since the passage states that Razorbacks earned $23 for each t-shirt sold, we can deduce that there were 467 t-shirts sold in total (5,190 / 23 = 467)."
Response: 51 dollars / 3 samarretes = 17 dollars per samarreta
Response:  The Razorbacks store made $87 per each shirt sold during the game. If they sold a total of 95 shirts during both the Arkansas and Texas Tech games, and sold 47 shirts during the Arkansas game, then they made $409 in revenue from shirt sales ($87 x 95 = $8,325).
"Response: 78
Explanation: According to the passage, Razorbacks sold 106 dollars for each shirt they sold during the game. Therefore, if they sold 115 shirts during the Arkansas game, they sold 115 x 106 = 12,390 dollars worth of shirts during that game. Since the total number of shirts sold during both games was 242, and the Arkansas game accounted for 115 of those shirts, then the remaining 127 shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  $98 x 89 = $8720
"Response: 44$
Explanation: According to the passage, Razorbacks earned $78 for each t-shirt sold during the game. Since they sold 186 t-shirts in total, they earned $78 x 186 = $14,304. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, they earned $78 x 172 = $13,056 less than what they earned during the Arkansas game. Therefore, the amount of money they earned selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is $14,304 - $13,056 = $948."

Each pack contains 2 invitations, so 5 packs will give her a total of 10 invitations (2 x 5 = 10). This means that each friend will receive two invitations, and there will be one extra invitation left over in case any additional friends want to come to the party."
Response: 48 invitations.
"Response: 35
Explanation: If Carol bought 7 packs of invitations and each pack has 10 invitations, then she has purchased a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she only wants to send invitations to two friends, she will have 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over."
"Response: 75
Explanation: According to the passage, Carol bought 6 packs of invitations, each containing 14 invitations, for a total of 84 invitations. Then, she purchased additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number of invitations to 95. Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends to her party."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Since each pack of invitations contains 3 invitations and Carol bought 2 packs, she has a total of 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To convidate 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 4."

Explanation: According to the question, La Melissa scored 12 points in each of the 4 games she played. Therefore, her total score was 4 x 12 = 48 points."
Response: 42
Response: 456 points. Explanation: If La Melissa scored 109 points in each match and also received 82 bonus points for each match, then she would have scored a total of 109 + 82 = 191 points per match. Since there were 79 matches played, La Melissa would have scored a total of 191 x 79 = 14,339 points.

Explanation: According to the question, if 20 people can drive at the same time in the Fortune Wheel in Paradise Park, and there are 4 seats in the wheel, then each seat can accommodate 5 people."
"Response: 5 seats
Explanation: According to the question, the Ferris wheel in the heavenly park has 9 seats per rotation. If 18 people can rotate at the same time, then the number of rotations required for all 18 people to ride is:

18 people / 9 seats per rotation = 2 rotations per person
Therefore, there are 2 x 9 = 18 seats in total on the Ferris wheel."
Response: 400 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at the same time. Explanation: Each Ferris wheel has 19 seats, and each seat can hold 15 people, so the total number of people that can ride on one Ferris wheel is 19 x 15 = 285 people. Since there are 20 Ferris wheels, the total number of people who can ride on them all at once is 285 x 20 = 5700 people.
Response: 70 people can climb the wheel of fortune at the same time. Explanation: The park has 18 seats in total, and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Since 10 seats are broken, there are only 8 seats available for use (18 - 10 = 8). Therefore, 8 x 15 = 120 people can climb the wheel of fortune at most. However, since some people may not be able to fit on certain seats due to their size or other factors, we will round up the number of people who can climb the wheel at once to 70.
Response: 3 more people can join the wheel.
Response: 70 people can ride the Ferris wheel in small seats. Explanation: The total number of small seats is 2 x 2 = 4, and each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so the total number of people who can ride in small seats is 4 x 14 = 56 people. Since there are also 23 large seats, we add that to the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel, giving us a grand total of 56 + 23 = 79 people. However, since we were asked how many people could fit in small seats only, our final answer is 70 people.
Response: 48 people can make the wheel of fortune in large seats.
Response: 4 people can sit at each seat of the wheel of fortune in Paradise Park at the same time. Therefore, there are 4 people per seat.
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, four people can play roulette in Paradise Park at the same time.

"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the question, La Paige and her mother planted 55 llavors of flowers. They put 15 llavors in each flower, so they planted a total of 55 x 15 = 825 llavors of flowers. Since only 60 llavors of flowers grew in each flower, the total number of flowers that grew was 825 / 60 = 13.75. Therefore, there were 13 + 7 = 20 flors that grew."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, La Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each flower bed. If they plant 60 seeds, then they will have 60 / 10 = 6 flower beds. Therefore, they have 6 llits of flowers."

Response: 5
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave an equal number of galets and pastries to his four friends. If he had 32 galets initially, then each friend got 8 galets (32/4 = 8). Similarly, if he had 98 pastries initially, then each friend got 24 pastries (98/4 = 24)."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave an equal number of galets and pastries to his four friends. If he had 10 galets initially, then each friend got 5 galets (since there are 4 friends). Since there were 8 pastries initially, each friend got 2 pastries (since there are 4 friends)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Matthew had 13 galetes and 15 pastissos initially. If he gave the same number of galetes and pastissos to his 28 friends, then each friend received 4 galetes and 4 pastissos (since 28 / 2 = 14).

Explanation:
There are 7 buses and each bus can seat 8 students, so there are 7 x 8 = 56 seats in total."
"Response: 84 x 95 = 8020
Explanation: The number of classes in the school is given as 84, and each bus can seat 118 students, so the total number of students who will go on the field trip is calculated by multiplying the number of classes by the number of buses."
"Response: 10
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available on each bus. In this case, there are 66 students in each class and 6 classes in total, so the total number of students is 66 x 6 = 396. Since there are only 6 seats available on each bus, we need 396 / 6 = 10 buses for the trip."
Response: 14 buses are needed for the trip. Explanation: Let X be the number of classes in the school. Since each class has the same number of students, we can assume that there are X students in total. Therefore, the total number of students who will go on the field trip is 58X. Since there are 2 seats available on each bus, we need at least (58X)/(2) = 29 buses to accommodate all the students. However, since we want to leave some extra space for safety and comfort, let's round up to 14 buses.
"Response: 36
Explanation: Let X be the number of students in each class. Since there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students, we can write:
X × 12 = 120
Now, since there are 84 seats available in each bus, we have:
X × 84 = 84
Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
X = 36
Therefore, there are 36 students in each class."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available on each bus. Since there are 102 students in the school and 8 seats available on each bus, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:

Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus
= 102 students / 8 seats/bus
= 4 buses
Therefore, 4 buses are needed for the field trip."
"Response: 45
Explanation: Let X be the number of students who will go on the trip. Since there are 102 classes in the school and 11 students in total, we can write the equation:
X + (102 - 99) = 11
Solving for X, we get:
X = 45
Therefore, 45 students from the school will go on the trip."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the number of students by the number of seats available in each bus. Since there are 3 seats available in each bus and there are 111 students in total, we can calculate that 4 buses are needed for the trip."
"Response: 50
Explanation:

"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, if 13 children like playing with hair and 50 children like playing cards, then Haley will have 26 hairs. Since there are 13 children who like playing with hair, each child will receive 26/13 = 2 hairs. Therefore, Haley will give 7 hairs to each of the 50 children who like playing cards."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If there are 20 pearls and 6 boys in the class who like to play with them, then each boy will receive 5 pearls if they are distributed equally."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave two bullets to each of the boys in her class. If she had 28 balls in total and there were X boys in the class, then we can set up the equation: 28 = 2X. Solving for X gives us X = 14. Therefore, Haley gave 2 bullets to 14 boys in her class."

Explanation:
Let's assume that the cost of each DVD is $107. If there is a discount of $106 for each DVD, then the new price of each DVD would be:
$107 - ($106 x number of DVDs) = $107 - $106^n
where n is the number of DVDs you want to buy.
Given that you can buy 4 DVDs with $93, we have:
$107 - $106^4 = $93
Solving for n, we get:
$106^n = 93
n = log10(93)/log10(106) = 4
Therefore, you can buy 4 DVDs with $93."

Response:  There are 28 plátanos in each group. Therefore, there are 28 x 7 = 196 plátanos in total.
Response:  The weight of each group of tangerines is 2.09 kg. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 356 tangerines and 142 bananas in Philip's collection. If we organize the tangerines into groups of 178, then the weight of each group of tangerines would be: Weight of group = Number of tangerines x Mass of one tangerine Where mass of one tangerine is given as 2.09 kg in the problem statement. Therefore, the weight of each group of tangerines is: Weight of group = 2.09 kg x 178 groups = 367.63 kg So, the weight of each group of tangerines is approximately 368 kg.
Response:  The number of groups is 196 and each group has 2 plátanos, so there are in total 196 x 2 = 392 plátanos in Philip's collection.
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there are 180 plátanos in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 18. Therefore, there will be 180 / 18 = 10 groups of plátanos."
Response:  There are 16 plátanos in each group. Therefore, there are 16 x 2 = 32 plátanos in total.
Response:  There are 10 tangerines in each group of plantains, so there are 10/345 = 0.029 groups with tangerines and 345 - 0.029 = 343.971 groups without tangerines. Therefore, there are 343971 / 16 = 2166.31 tangerines in each group of plantains.

Response: 420 galetes (14 x 30 = 420)
"Response: 3/5
Explanation: Let X be the number of galetes that each person got. Since there were 5 people in total and the mother made 22 galetes, we can write an equation: 5X = 22. Now, we are told that the mother had to throw away 17 galetes, so we subtract this amount from both sides of the equation: 5X - 17 = 22. Simplifying, we get X = 3/5. Therefore, each person got 3/5 of the total number of galetes."

Response: 40 more ampolles of apple than of pome.
Response:  The supermarket had more than 36 apples.
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, there were a total of 30 ampolles, and 28 of them were regular refreshments. Therefore, the number of dietetic refreshment ampolles is 30 - 28 = 2. So, 2 ampolles of dietetic refreshment were consumed."
"Response: 320
Explanation: Let's assume that each supermarket has 4 dietetic drinks and 79 regular drinks. So, in total, they have 83 (4 + 79) drinks. Since there are 4 dietetic drinks, we can say that for every 4 dietetic drinks, there are 7 regular drinks. Therefore, if the supermarket had 320 regular drinks, then it would mean that they had 320 / 4 = 80 regular drinks per 4 dietetic drinks."

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, there were 317 visitors at the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel had lunch there. If there were 295 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the number of visitors on those two days is:

317 - 295 = 22
Therefore, 22 more people visited the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel had lunch there than visited it the previous day."
"Response: 1890
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* The number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham yesterday was 703.
* There were 246 visitors to the palace that day.
To find out how many visitors went to the palace over 25 days, we need to use the following formula:
Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors per day
In this case, the total number of visitors is 703 (from the previous day), and the number of visitors per day is 246 (based on the information provided). Therefore, the number of visitors to the palace over 25 days can be calculated as follows:
Number of visitors = 703 / 246 = 1890
So, there were approximately 1890 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham over 25 days."
"Response: 344
Explanation:
According to the question, there were 100 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before and 666 visitors that day. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors the previous day and the current day is:

100 - 666 = -566

So, there were 566 more visitors to the palace on the day in question than there were the day before."
"Response: 584

Explanation:
The information given in the question is:

* 132 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after lunch (despite not being explicitly stated, we can assume this means the same day as the previous statement)
* 406 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham over the last 327 days

To find out how many visitors went to the palace the day before, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the day after lunch from the total number of visitors over the last 327 days:

Number of visitors the day before = Total number of visitors - Number of visitors on the day after lunch
= 406 - 132
= 274

Therefore, there were 274 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before."
"Response: 3710

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* The number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in the last 85 days is 829.
* There were 45 visitors to the palace the day before.

To find out how many visitors visited the palace that particular day, we need to multiply the total number of visitors by the number of days since the previous day:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors x Number of days since previous day
= 829 x 85
= 69,710

Therefore, there were 69,710 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham that particular day."
"Response: 3064
Explanation:
Let X be the number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in one day. Since there were 557 visitors on the day after Rachel and her friend had lunch there, we can write:
X + 1 = 557... (1)
Similarly, since there were 188 visitors the previous day, we can write:
X - 1 = 188... (2)
Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously:
Subtracting (1) from (2), we get:
2X = 745
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
X = 372
Therefore, the total number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in 57 days is:
X × 57 = 372 × 57 = 21,344
So, the answer is 21,344."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
Let X be the number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the previous day (i.e., the day before the day described in the passage). Since there were 600 visitors that day, we can write:
X + 6 = 600
Now, let Y be the number of visitors to the palace on the day described in the passage. We are told that there were 39 paintings at the palace on this day, and Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the palace on this day. So, we can write:
Y = 661 - 39
Substituting Y into the equation above, we get:
X + Y = 600 + (661 - 39)
= 600 + 582
= 1182
Therefore, there were 1182 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day described in the passage, which is 41 more than the previous day."
"Response: 568

Explanation:
We are given that there were 92 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day in question. We also know that there were 419 visitors the day before and 103 visitors the day before that. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

92 + 419 + 103 = x

Where ""x"" represents the total number of visitors to the palace over the three days.

Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 568

Therefore, the answer is 568 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham over the three days."
"Response: 363
Explanation:
The information given in the question is:
* 512 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel had lunch there.
* 471 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before.
* 808 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham two days ago.
To find out how many people visited the palace in the last 89 days, we can use the following formula:
Number of visitors = (512 - 471) + (471 - 808) +... + (-808)
= 41 + 398 + 499 + 808
= 1666
Therefore, 1666 people visited the Palace of Buckingham in the last 89 days."
"Response: 368
Explanation:
The information given in the question is:
* On the day after they had lunch, 705 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace.
* There were 191 visitors the day before.
* There were 457 visitors the day before that.
To find out how many more visitors came to the palace on the day after lunch compared to the previous days, we can subtract the number of visitors from each of those days and add them up:
191 - 457 + 705 = 368
Therefore, there were 368 more visitors at the Buckingham Palace on the day after lunch than there were on the previous 245 days combined."

Response:  There are 5 houses in each block, so if he gives 25 letters to each house, there will be a total of 125 letters given to all the houses in one block.
Response: 36 pieces of mail (9 x 4 blocks).
Response:  Each block has 6 houses, so each house will receive 24/6 = 4 pieces of mail.
Response:  There are 7 houses in each block, so there are 7 x 7 = 49 houses in total.
Response:  Each block will receive 32 pieces of mail from the carrier, so to find out how many pieces of mail each block will receive in total, we need to multiply the number of blocks by 32. Therefore, the answer is: 20 blocks x 32 pieces/block = 640 pieces of mail.
Response: 240 pieces of mail. Explanation: To determine how many pieces of mail each house in a block will receive, we need to divide the total number of pieces of mail by the number of houses in that block. In this case, there are 19 houses per block, so if the carrier has to give 30 pieces of mail to each block, then he will have to give 560 pieces of mail (30 x 19 = 560) to all the blocks together. Therefore, each house will receive 240/560 = 0.42 or approximately 24 pieces of mail.
Response:  There are 6 houses in each block, so there are 6 x 55 = 330 houses in total.
"Response: 36
Explanation:
Since there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses, the number of pieces of mail that the carrier needs to deliver is 81 x 12 = 972 pieces of mail. Therefore, the remaining 4 pieces of mail will be left over after delivery, which means that each block will have 972 / 81 = 12 trossos of undelivered mail."
Response: 320 pieces of mail. Explanation: If there are 17 houses in each block and 4 pieces of mail per house, then the total number of pieces of mail donated is 17 x 4 = 68. Since there are 16 blocks, the total number of pieces of mail donated is 68 x 16 = 1056. However, since the question states that the carrier has to give 4 extra pieces of mail to each house, the total number of pieces of mail donated is actually 1056 + (16 x 4) = 1056 + 64 = 1120.

* Adam has 4 apples more than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 10 apples, Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples.
* Jackie has 2 apples more than Adam. So, if Adam has 14 apples, Jackie has 14 - 2 = 12 apples.
* Together, Adam and Jackie have 6 apples more than they have individually. So, if Adam has 14 apples and Jackie has 12 apples, together they have 14 + 12 = 26 apples.
* Therefore, Adam has 8 apples (14 - 6)."
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, which means she has a total of 90 fruits (89 + 11 = 90). Since Adam has more than Jackie, he must have at least 90 apples as well. Therefore, Adam has 70 apples (90 - 20 = 70)."
