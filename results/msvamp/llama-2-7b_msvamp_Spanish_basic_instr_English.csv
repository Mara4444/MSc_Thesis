"Response: 14 hours
Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day studying these two languages.

"Response: 3 hours
Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese and some additional time learning English. If he spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, that means he spends 7 hours (5 + 2) learning Chinese and 3 hours (7 - 4) learning English."
"Response: 30 hours
Explanation:
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. If he studies for 5 days, he will spend a total of 6 x 5 = 30 hours studying English and 7 x 5 = 35 hours studying Chinese."
"Response: 30 hours
Explanation:
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. If he studies for 2 days, he will spend a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours studying English and 5 + 5 = 10 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, in total, Ryan will have spent 11 + 10 = 21 hours studying both languages combined."
"Response: 24 hours
Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 5 + 4 = 9 hours per day studying. Since he studies for 6 days, he spends a total of 9 hours/day x 6 days = 54 hours studying Chinese in one week."
"Response: 30/2 = 15
Explanation:
Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese. If he learns for 86 days, then he will have spent a total of 86 x 4 = 337 hours learning English and 86 x 6 = 504 hours learning Chinese. Since he learns both languages every day, we can divide the total number of hours by the number of days to find out how many hours he spends on each language per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 337/86 = 15 hours per day learning English and 504/86 = 15 hours per day learning Chinese."
"Response: 15 hours
Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 7 hours per day learning Chinese, and 3 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many hours he spends in total learning these three languages, we can simply multiply the number of days by the number of hours spent each day: 6 x 7 = 42 hours for Chinese, 7 x 3 = 21 hours for Spanish, and 6 x 7 = 42 hours for English, for a total of 15 hours (42 + 21 + 42)."
"Response: 120 hours
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 3 hours per day learning Chinese, and 58 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than learning Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning Chinese from the total number of hours he spends learning both languages. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 6 - 3 = 3 hours per day, or 210 hours per week (since there are 7 days in a week). So, Ryan spends 210 hours more per week learning English than he does learning Chinese."
"Response: 5 hours
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. Therefore, he spends a total of 11 hours (7 + 4) per day learning both languages combined. Since he spends more time learning English than Spanish, he spends 5 hours more per day learning English than Spanish."

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 12
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 6
So, there are 6 duraznos verdes in each cesta."
"Response: 3

Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 19 more canicas than Doug initially. If Ed lost some of his canicas in the park and now has 8 more than Doug, that means he had 19 - 8 = 11 canicas fewer after losing them. Therefore, Ed lost 11 canicas in the park."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 30 more cans than Doug. So, if Ed had 91 cans and lost 21 of them in the park, he would have 70 cans left (91 - 21 = 70). Since Ed had 30 more cans than Doug, Doug must have had 40 cans (70 - 30 = 40)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 12 more cans than Doug. So, if Ed had 17 cans and lost 20 of his own, then he must have started with 17 - 20 = 5 cans. Therefore, Doug has 5 + 12 = 17 cans now."

"Response: 24
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
La langosta saltó 36 pulgadas. (Given)
La rana saltó 17 pulgadas más que la langosta. (Given)
El ratón saltó 15 pulgadas más que la rana. (Given)
Now, let's find out how much the rana salted:
Rana salted = Langosta + Ratón - Rana
= 36 + 15 - 17
= 24
Therefore, the rana salted 24 pulgadas."
Response: 30 pulgadas.
"Response: 5 feet
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
La langosta saltó 19 pulgadas (or 76 inches).
La rana saltó 10 pulgadas más que la langosta (or 46 + 19 = 65 inches).
El ratón saltó 20 pulgadas más que la rana (or 65 + 20 = 85 inches).
Now, we need to convert these measurements from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:
76 inches = 6.375 feet (for the langosta)
65 inches = 5.375 feet (for the rana)
85 inches = 7 feet (for the ratón)
Therefore, the answer is 5 feet more than the length of the langosta's jump."
Response: 58 pulgadas
"Response: 10 inches
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that the raton salted 26 pulgadas less than the rana. Since the rana salted 32 pulgadas more than the langosta, and the langosta salted 25 pulgadas, we can set up the following equation:
Ratón = Rana - (Langosta x 32) + 26
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Ratón = 32 - (25 x 32) + 26
= 32 - 792 + 26
= -846
Therefore, the ratón salted 846 inches or 215 cm."
"Response: 19
Explanation:  The raton saltó 5 pulgadas menos que la rana, which means it saltó 38 pulgadas (33 + 5). Therefore, the ratón saltó 19 pulgadas more than the langosta."
Response: 15 pulgadas
Response: 40 pulgadas
Response: 50 pulgadas
Response:  Ratón saltó 40 - 12 = 28 pulgadas.
"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
La langosta saltó 21 pulgadas. (1)
La langosta saltó 25 pulgadas más que la rana. (2)
El ratón saltó 16 pulgadas menos que la rana. (3)
From equation (1), we know that the distance Langosta = 21 pulgadas.
From equation (2), we know that the distance Langosta - Rana = 25 pulgadas.
Substituting the value of 21 from equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
Langosta - Rana = 25 - 21 = 4 pulgadas.
Now, let's use equation (3):
Ratón - Rana = 16 pulgadas.
Substituting the value of 4 from equation (4) into equation (3), we get:
Ratón - Rana = 16 - 4 = 12 pulgadas.
Therefore, the difference between the distance Langosta and Ratón is 40 pulgadas (4 + 12). So, the answer is 40."
Response: 22 pulgadas (39 - 17 = 22)
Response: 27 pulgadas
"Response: 5
Explanation:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:
La langosta saltó 14 pulgadas. (distance = 14)
El ratón saltó 16 pulgadas menos que la rana, quien saltó 37 pulgadas más que la langosta. (ratio = 37/16 - 14/16)
So, the difference between the distance covered by the raton and the langosta is:
Ratón - Langosta = 37 - 14 = 23 pulgadas
Therefore, the ratón saltó 23 pulgadas more than the langosta."

Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 90 crayons and lost 412 crayons during the year. Therefore, he had 110 - 90 = 20 crayons left at the end of the year. Since he lost 412 crayons, he had 412 - 20 = 536 more crayons than he gave away to his friends."
"Response: 100
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 100 crayons in his birthday box. This is because he gave away 563 crayons during the school year and lost 558 crayons, leaving him with only 332 crayons. Therefore, he must have started with 100 crayons in the first place."
Response: 403 crayons (535 - 52 = 403)
"Response: 387 (crayons)
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Paul received a total of 521 crayons and 66 sketchpads at his birthday party. At the end of the school year, he had only 154 crayons left, which means that 387 crayons were either lost or given away."

Response: 291
"Response: 359 - 231 = 128
Explanation: According to the question, Paul lost 231 crayons and gave away 308 crayons during the school year. Therefore, he had 128 more crayons after giving them away than he did at the beginning of the year."
Response: 169 more crayons than borradors.
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The camarero had 11 clients initially.
* After some clients left, he still had 3 clients.
* So, the number of clients who left = 11 - 3 = 8.
Therefore, 8 clients more left than remained behind."
"Response: 1
Explanation: The number of customers who remained is equal to the number of customers who left minus the total number of customers initially. In this case, 3 - 2 = 1 customer remained."
"Response: 5 clients
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Un camarero tenía algunos clientes."" - This means that the bartender had some customers at first.
* ""Después de que 9 clientes se fueran,"" - After 9 customers left.
* ""todavía había 12 clientes."" - There were still 12 customers left.

So, if there were initially 5 customers (as stated in the question), and 9 of them left, then the total number of customers the bartender had at one point was 5 + 12 = 17."
"Response: 9
Explanation: The original number of customers was 14. If 5 customers left, then there are 14 - 5 = 9 customers remaining."
Response: 5 clients went away.
"Response: 10 clients
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The bartender had 12 customers initially.
* 15 customers left, so the number of customers decreased by 15.
* 14 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers increased by 14.

Therefore, the final number of customers the bartender has is:

12 - 15 + 14 = 10

So, the bartender currently has 10 customers."
Response: 5 new clients arrived.
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The camarero had 8 clients initially.
* After some clients left, he still had 5 clients.
* Then, 99 new customers arrived.

So, if the camarero had 8 clients to start with and 5 remained after some clients left, that means 3 clients left (since 8 - 5 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response: 26 clients.
Response: 5 dollars (Dan had $5 initially)
Response: 75 cents ($.75)
Response: 1 dollar (or $1)
"Response:  $8
Explanation: According to the question, Dan spent $3 on two bars of candy that cost him the same amount of money. Therefore, each bar of candy cost him half of his initial amount, which is $3 / 2 = $8 per bar."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Dan spent $6 x 4 = $24 on the bars of candy. Since he had only $2 initially, this means that he bought 4 bars of candy."
"Response: 2 + 3 = 5
Dan has $5 left after buying the candy bars."
"Response: 
Dan spent $13 ($7 + $6) buying the bar of caramel and the chocolate."
"Response: 4/7
Explanation: To find out how much Dan spent on buying the bar of caramel compared to the chocolate, we need to divide the cost of the bar of caramel by the cost of the chocolate. In this case, the cost of the bar of caramel is $6 and the cost of the chocolate is $3, so we can calculate the ratio as follows:
$6 / $3 = 4/7
Therefore, Dan spent four-sevenths (or 4/7) of his total money on buying the bar of caramel compared to one-third (or 1/3) of his total money on buying the chocolate."
"Response: 
Dan spent $3 more to buy the chocolate than he did to buy the bar of caramel. Therefore, the cost of the chocolate is $3 greater than the cost of the bar of caramel."
"Response: 12 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, Dan had $4 before buying the bar of candy for $8. Therefore, he spent $8 - $4 = $4 on the candy. After his friend gave him $5, he now has $4 + $5 = $9."
"Response: 2 dollars (or $2)
Explanation: According to the question, Dan had $3 left after buying a bar of caramel. If he started with $4, then the cost of the bar of caramel is $4 - $3 = $1."
"Response:  $1
Explanation: According to the question, Dan spent a total of $3 on 10 bars of candy, which means he has $4 - $3 = $1 left."
"Response: ₡1.50 (or $1.50)
Explanation: To find out how much each bar of candy costs, we need to divide the amount Dan spent ($4) by the number of bars he bought (2). So, each bar of candy costs ₡1.50 or $1.50."
"Response: 
Dan spent $7 to buy the bar of caramels and $3 to buy the chocolate. So, he spent more money on the bar of caramels than on the chocolate. The ratio of the amount spent on the bar of caramels to the amount spent on the chocolate is 7:3 or 2:1."
"Response: 3/4
Explanation: To find out how much Dan spent on buying the chocolate compared to the bar of candy, we need to divide the cost of the chocolate by the total amount he had ($4). So, if Dan spent $7 on the chocolate, that means he spent 3/4 of his money (or $7 / $4 = 3/4) on it."

Response: 200 (books)
Response: 72 books were sold at the yard sale.
"Response: 101
Explanation: According to the question, after buying some books at a garage sale, Paul had 151 books left. If he started with 50 books, that means he bought 101 books at the garage sale."
Response: 73 books were sold at the yard sale.
"Response: 27
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. After selling those books, he bought 42 new ones, which brought his total number of books to 63 (21 + 42). Now, if he has 15 books left, that means he sold 48 more books than he bought (63 - 15 = 48). Therefore, the answer is 27."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some of his books at a garage sale, Paul had 71 books left. Then he bought 38 new books, so he now has 116 books in total (71 + 38 = 116). To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought: 40 (new books) - 38 (books sold) = 40."
Response: 42 books were sold at the yard sale.
"Response: 64
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books and pens at a garage sale, Paul had 82 books and 14 pens left. If he started with 106 pens, then he sold 64 pens at the garage sale."
"Response: 99
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Paul initially had 136 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling some books, he was left with 27 books. To find out how many books Paul sold, we can use the following equation:
Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books left after sale
= 136 - 27
= 109
Therefore, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale."
"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the question, after giving 39 books to his friend and selling some at a garage sale, Paul had 68 books left. If he sold 25 books at the garage sale, then he must have sold 25 - 39 = 25 books in total."
Response: 40 books were sold at the yard sale.
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books and pens at a garage sale, Paul had 113 books and 19 pens left. If he sold 30 pens at the garage sale, then he must have sold 30 - 19 = 11 pens before he had 113 books left. Therefore, he sold 30 bolígrafos in the garage sale."

Response: 4 (twenty-three minus sixteen)
Response: 10 rosas cortadas (or 10 new roses added to the vase).
"Response: 6 more roses cut from those she threw away. 
Explanation: According to the question, Jessica took 33 roses out of the vase and then cut some new roses from her garden to add to it. This means that there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she cut than she threw away, we can subtract the number of roses she threw away (33) from the total number of roses in the vase after she added new ones (17). Therefore, the answer is 6 more roses cut from those she threw away."
"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the question, Jessica took 34 rosas from the vase and cut some new roses from her garden to add to it. This means she took a total of 34 + 19 = 53 rosas from the jar. Since there were originally 21 rosas in the vase, this means that after taking out 53 rosas, there are now 21 - 53 = -32 rosas left in the vase. Therefore, Jessica took 19 more rosas from her garden than she put into the vase."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 7 rosas in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses from her garden that had a total of 59 roses. This means she cut 52 roses (59 - 7 = 52). Therefore, there are now 20 roses in the vase. So, Jessica cut 39 roses (20 - 52 = 39)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 12 roses in Jessica's garden. If she cut some more from her garden and added them to the vase with the 13 roses already there, then there are now 21 roses in the vase. Therefore, there must be 9 roses left in Jessica's garden."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the passage, there were originally 15 rosas and 62 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, then there are now 17 rosas and 96 orquídeas in the vase. This means that Jessica cut 3 additional roses (from 15 to 17)."

Response: 5 more orquídeas than roses are in the vase now.
Response: 16 (19 - 3 = 16)
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, there were originally 13 rosas and 84 orquídeas in the vase. If Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden, then there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. This means that Jessica cut 7 roses (14 - 7 =)."
"Response: 4 orquídeas
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 3 orchids in the vase. Since Jessica cut some more from her garden of flowers, there are now 7 orchids in the vase. Therefore, she must have cut 4 orchids."
Response: 4 more roses than orchids are in the vase now.
Response: 6 more orquídeas than roses are in the vase now.

Response: 65 (12 + 53)
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 21 tapas of bottles in his collection before he found some more in the park. If he now has 53 tapas of bottles, that means he found 32 additional tapas of bottles in the park (53 - 21 = 32)."
Response: 94 (found by subtracting the number of old bottle caps he found from the total number of new bottle caps he collected)
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 36 tapas de botellas in the park and threw away 35 old ones. This means he gained 14 new tapas de botellas."
"Response: 30 - 63 = -33
Danny threw away 33 more tapas than he found in the park."
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 22 tapas of bottles in the park initially. Therefore, he had 22 tapas of bottles at the beginning."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 30 envelopes in the park and now he has 57 envelopes in his collection. This means that he had 30 envelopes at first."
Response: 22 (tapas - envoltorios)
"Response: 33
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 28 envelopes in the park and already had 11 tapas of bottles. So he now has 68 taps of bottle + 28 envelopes = 96. Then, he found additional 51 envelopes, so he now has 96 + 51 = 147 envelopes. Therefore, Danny found 33 more envelopes than bottle caps in the park."
Response: 10 (tapas de botellas) - 8 (envoltorios) = 2 more tapas of bottles than envelopes.
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 62 envelopes before he found 10 more tapas of bottles in the park. So, he now has 62 + 10 = 72 envelopes. Then, he found 27 more tapas of bottles and collected them. Therefore, he now has 72 envelopes (the total number of envelopes he already had) plus 27 new tapas of bottles, which is equal to 99 envelopes."
"Response: 41
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Danny collected 66 tapas de botellas in the park. (This is the total number of tapas he had at first.)
* He lost 66 tapas de botellas in the park. (So, now he has fewer tapas than he did initially.)
* Now, he has 25 tapas de botellas in his collection. (This is the current number of tapas he has.)

To find out how many tapas Danny had at first, we can subtract the number he lost from the current number he has:

41 = 66 - 66

Therefore, Danny had 41 tapas de botellas at the beginning."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 25 tapas de botellas in his collection before he found some more in the park. Then, he found 7 additional tapas de botellas in the park, bringing his total number of tapas de botellas to 32."
"Response: 60
Explanation: According to the question, Danny collected 60 old bottle caps in the park and found 58 new ones. Therefore, he had 60 + 58 = 118 bottle caps at first."
"Response: 48
Explanation: According to the question, Danny collected 6 old bottle caps in the park and found 50 new ones. Therefore, he found a total of 50 + 6 = 56 new bottle caps in the park. Since he already had 6 old bottle caps, his total collection is now 56 + 6 = 62 bottle caps. So, Danny found 48 more bottle caps than he threw away in the park."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Danny collected 54 old bottle caps in the park and found 48 new ones. So he has a total of 52 bottle caps in his collection now. To find out how many more he threw away, we subtract the number he found from the total number he had: 52 - 48 = 6. Therefore, Danny threw away 6 bottle caps."
"Response: 40 taps of bottles
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 40 taps of bottles at the beginning and collected 42 more after searching the park. Therefore, Danny initially had 40 taps of bottles."
"Response: 68
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 68 envelopes in the park and now he has 68 envelopes in his collection. Therefore, Danny had 68 envelopes at the beginning of the story."
Response: 39 (tapas de botellas) - 52 (envoltorios) = 13 more tapas of bottles than envelopes found in the park by Danny.
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 65 envelopes and 5 bottle caps in the park. This means he found 65 - 5 = 60 envelopes more than bottle caps. So, Danny found 60 + 31 = 91 envelopes in total."
Response: 10 (tapas de botellas) - 7 (envoltorios) = 3 more tapas of bottles than envelopes.
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, Danny has 67 envelopes and 35 bottle caps in his collection. If he found 15 bottle caps and 18 envelope in the park, then he had 0 envelopes and 0 bottle caps before finding them. Therefore, the number of envelopes he found is 67 - 0 = 67, and the number of bottle caps he found is 35 + 15 = 50. So, Danny now has 67 more envelopes than bottle caps."
"Response: 49
Explanation: According to the question, Jake has 11 fewer duraznos than Steven. So if Jake has 17 duraznos, then Steven must have 49 duraznos (17 - 11 = 49)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 7 less than Steven, which means Jake has x = 7 + 14 = 21 duraznos.
Steven has 15 duraznos more than Jill, which means Steven has x = 15 - 7 = 8 duraznos.
So, Jake has 21 - 8 = 13 duraznos."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Steven has 19 duraznos and Jill has 20 duraznos. Therefore, Jill has 20 - 19 = 1 more durazno than Steven."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 3 fewer melons than Steven. So, if Steven has x melons, then Jake has x - 3 melons.
Steven has 8 more melons than Jill. So, if Jill has y melons, then Steven has y + 8 melons.
We know that Steven has 5 melons, so we can write an equation:
x + 8 = y + 5
Solving for y (the number of melons Jill has), we get:
y = 12
So, Jill has 12 melons.
Now, let's find out how many more melons Jake has than Jill:
Jake has 3 fewer melons than Jill, so he has:
Jake's melons = Jill's melons - 3
Jake's melons = 12 - 3
Jake's melons = 9
Therefore, Jake has 9 more melons than Jill."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 12 duraznos less than Steven. This means that Jake has 12 + X duraznos, where X is the number of duraznos that Steven has. Since Steven has 11 more duraznos than Jill, we can write:
Jake = 12 + X
Steven = Jill + 11
Now, we are told that Steven has 4 duraznos. So, we can substitute this value into the equation for Steven:
Steven = Jill + 11
Substituting the value of Jill (which is 12 + X), we get:
Steven = 12 + X + 11
Simplifying and solving for X (the number of duraznos that Jill has), we get:
X = 3
Therefore, Jill has 3 more duraznos than Jake."
Response: 23
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Steven has 17 duraznos and Jake has 7 less than Steven, so Jake has 10 duraznos (17 - 7 = 10). Additionally, Jill has 8 more than Jake, so Jill has 18 duraznos (10 + 8 = 18). Therefore, Jill has 9 duraznos."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Steven has 16 duraznos and Jill has 9 duraznos less than him, so Jill has 7 duraznos. Additionally, Steven has 18 more duraznos than Jill, so he has 25 duraznos (16 + 18). Therefore, Steven has 4 more duraznos than Jill."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 18 more duraznos than Jill and Jake has 6 less duraznos than Jill. So, if Jill has 5 duraznos, then Jake has 9 duraznos (5 - 6 = 9)."
"Response: 29
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 5 less than Steven. So, if Steven has x duraznos, Jake has x - 5 duraznos.
Steven has 18 more than Jill. So, if Jill has y duraznos, Steven has y + 18 duraznos.
The total number of duraznos that Jill has is 87. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
y + (y + 18) = 87
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2y + 18 = 87
Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us:
2y = 69
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
y = 34
So, Jill has 34 duraznos.
Now, let's find out how many more duraznos Jake has than Jill:
If Jake has x duraznos and Jill has 34 duraznos, then Jake has x - 34 duraznos.
Therefore, Jake has 34 more duraznos than Jill."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Steven has 15 more duraznos than Jill. So, if Jill has 12 duraznos, then Steven has 15 + 12 = 27 duraznos. Therefore, Jill has 4 more duraznos than Jake (since Jake has 16 less duraznos than Steven)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 12 less duraznos than Steven, so Jake has 30 - 12 = 18 duraznos.
Additionally, Jake has 79 more manzanas than Steven, so Jake has 18 + 79 = 97 manzanas.
Since Steven has 19 duraznos and 14 manzanas, we can conclude that Jake has 18 (duraznos) + 97 (manzanas) = 115 fruit. Therefore, Jake has 30 duraznos."
"Response: 5 manzanas
Explanation: According to the question, Steven has 9 duraznos and 8 manzanas, so he has a total of 17 fruit (9 + 8 = 17). Since Jake has 3 more manzanas than Steven, Jake must have 17 + 3 = 20 manzanas. Therefore, Jake has 5 manzanas."
Response: 4 more manzanas than duraznos.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 12 melocotones and 15 manzanas, which means he has a total of 27 fruit (12 + 15 = 27). On the other hand, Jake has 3 melocotones fewer than Steven, which means Jake has 24 fruit (10 + 3 = 24). Therefore, Steven has 5 more manzanas than melocotones (27 - 24 = 3)."
"Response: 35
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Steven has 12 duraznos.
Jake has 4 less than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 duraznos.
Steven has 67 more than Jill, so Steven has 67 + 0 = 67 duraznos.
Therefore, Jake has 8 duraznos."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 18 duraznos. Jake has 12 less than Steven, so Jake has 6 duraznos (18 - 12 = 6). Additionally, Steven has 8 more than Jill, so Jill has 4 duraznos (8 - 0 = 4). Therefore, Jill has 4 duraznos."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Steven has 19 duraznos.
Jake has 12 less than Steven and 72 more than Jill.
So, if Steven has x duraznos, Jake has x - 12 duraznos.
Since Jill has 0 duraznos (since she is not mentioned in the question), Jake has 72 + (x - 12) = 84 duraznos.
Therefore, Jake has 84 duraznos."
Response: 7
"Response: 7
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 84 more manzanas than Steven, which means Jake has 84 + 52 = 136 manzanas.
Steven has 10 less duraznos than Jake, which means Steven has 13 - 10 = 3 duraznos.
Therefore, Jake has 7 duraznos (since he has 136 manzanas and 3 duraznos)."
"Response: 25
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 13 more manzanas than Steven, which means that if Steven has x manzanas, then Jake has 13 + x manzanas.
Additionally, Steven has 17 fewer duraznos than Jake, which means that if Jake has y duraznos, then Steven has 17 - y duraznos.
We know that Steven has 8 duraznos and 12 manzanas, so we can set up the equation:
17 - y = 8 (duraznos)
y = 9 (manzanas)
Therefore, Jake has 25 manzanas."
Response: 2 more manzanas than duraznos.
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 19 manzanas and 15 duraznos, which means he has a total of 34 fruit (19 + 15 = 34). On the other hand, Jake has 3 duraznos less than Steven, which means Jake has 34 - 3 = 31 fruit. Therefore, Steven has 6 more manzanas than duraznos (34 - 3 = 31)."
Response: 63 dollars (78 - 15 = 63)
Response: 100 dollars (initial amount)
"Response: 39 dollars (or $39)
Explanation: According to the passage, after visiting the supermarket, Olivia had $159 left in her wallet. If she spent $148 at an ATM, that means she had $159 - $148 = $11 more than she started with ($11 + $100 = $110). So, she did not spend any money at the supermarket."
"Response: 52 dollars 
Explanation: According to the question, Olivia had $3 in her wallet and collected $49 from an ATM. After visiting the grocery store, she was left with $49. Therefore, she must have collected $52 more than she spent at the grocery store."
Response: 78 dollars 
"Response: 23 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, after visiting the supermarket and the exhibition hall, Oliva had $26 left in her wallet. If she spent $49 at the exhibition hall, then she must have spent $23 at the supermarket."
"Response: 26 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, after Olivia visited the grocery store and spent money there, she was left with $29 in her wallet. Initially, she had $54 in her wallet, so the amount she spent at the store is $29 - $54 = -$25. Since it's not possible to spend negative amounts of money, we can conclude that Olivia did not actually spend any money at the store. Therefore, the correct answer is $0 (or no money)."
"Response: 90 dollars
Explanation: To find out how much money Olivia has left after spending $38 at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial balance in her wallet. So, if she initially had $128 and spent $38, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90)."

"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Dave had 10 applications in his phone initially and then added 11 new ones. After removing some of them, he was left with 4 applications. Therefore, he eliminated 7 applications (10 - 4 = 7)."
Response: 67 (Dave added 89 - 21 = 67 applications)
"Response: 56 - 7 = 49
Explanation: The original number of applications was 15. After adding 71 new applications, he had a total of 86 (15 + 71). Then, he deleted some applications and ended up with 14. So, the difference between the number of applications added and the number of applications deleted is 49 (86 - 14)."
Response: 9 (eliminated applications)
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 3 applications and 7 files left in his phone. This means that he deleted 4 archives (7 - 3 = 4)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: The number of applications that Dave had in his phone before deleting some is given as 15. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 21 applications. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of applications and the final number of applications is 15 - 21 = -6. Since there are no negative numbers of applications, the answer must be positive. So, the number of applications that Dave has in his phone after deleting some is 7 (21 - 15)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 6 applications left in his phone. Since he also deleted some files, he now has 15 files remaining. Therefore, there are 9 more files than applications (6 apps - 6 apps = 9 files)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Dave had 17 applications in his phone before adding some more. Therefore, he added 3 applications to have 18 applications in total."
Response: 4 applications.
"Response: 7

"Response: 20
Explanation: The number of files left in Dave's phone after he deleted some applications and files is 24 (files) + 2 (applications) = 26. Since there are more files than applications, the number of files minus the number of applications equals 20."
"Response: 106
Explanation: The problem states that Nell had 242 baseball cards and gave 136 to Jeff. This means that she has 106 cards left for herself."
"Response: 301
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 301 baseball cards initially and gave 301 of them to Jeff. This means that she has 154 baseball cards left after giving some away. So, the initial number of baseball cards owned by Nell is 301."
"Response: 396
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 528 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she was left with 252 cards. So, the number of cards that Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of cards (528) and her current number of cards (252), which is 276. Since Jeff already had 11 cards, Nell must have given him 276 - 11 = 395 cards."
"Response: 301
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. After giving him some of her cards, she has 535 cards left. So, Jeff must have received 31 (566 - 535 = 31) cards from Nell. Therefore, he now has 234 + 31 = 305 cards."
Response: 28 more baseball cards than ten cards. 
"Response: 378
Explanation:
Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 number cards before giving some to Jeff. After giving them away, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 number cards in total. So, the number of number cards Nell has now is:
495 - 214 = 281
Therefore, Nell has 378 more number cards than baseball cards."
"Response: 46
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 573 baseball cards and gave some to John and Jeff. After giving some to John, she had 210 cards left. If she gave some more to Jeff, then the total number of cards she gave him is equal to the number of cards she had left minus the number of cards she gave to John. Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is 210 - 195 = 46."
"Response: 260
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has 178 baseball cards left and 55 cards of the type that Jeff received from her (since he got some of her baseball cards). Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nell has more than cards of 10 is 260 (438 - 178 + 55 = 260)."
"Response: 145
Explanation:
Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 376 ten-card sets and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more ten-card sets Nell has than baseball cards, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of ten-card sets:
376 - 111 = 265
So Nell has 265 more ten-card sets than baseball cards."

Explanation: According to the question, Paco had 28 galletas initially and he consumed some of them, leaving him with 7 galletas. To find out how many galletas Paco consumed, we can subtract the number of galletas he had left (7) from the initial amount (28), which gives us 21. Therefore, Paco consumed 21 galletas."
"Response: 15
Explanation: Initially, Paco had 40 galletaes and he ate 2 of them, so he had 38 left. Then, he bought 37 more, so he has a total of 75 galletaes (40 + 37 = 75). Therefore, Paco has 75 - 2 = 73 galletaes left."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Paco had 25 galletaes initially and he consumed 5 of them. Then, he bought 3 more galletas. So, the total number of galletas that Paco has after buying is 25 + 3 = 28. Therefore, he consumed 5 + 3 = 8 galletas more than the ones he bought."
"Response: 15
Explanation: The total number of galletas that Paco had was 13 + 36 = 49. Since he already consumed 2 galletas, the remaining number of galletas he bought is 49 - 2 = 47. Therefore, Paco bought 15 more galletas than the ones he consumed."
"Response: 22
Explanation: If Paco had 40 galletas and he ate 5, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 galletas left. He gave his friend 13 galletas, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 galletas left."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Paco had 17 galletas (cookies). He ate 14 of them, leaving him with 3 galletas. Then, he gave 13 galletas to his friend, which means that he has 3 more galletas than the ones he gave away. Therefore, the correct answer is 3."
"Response: 5 (more)
Explanation: According to the question, Paco had 12 cookies and ate 16 of them, leaving him with 12 - 16 = -4 cookies. Then, he gave his friend 21 cookies, which is more than the number of cookies he ate (-4), so the difference between the number of cookies given away and the number of cookies eaten is 21 - (-4) = 25 cookies. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 25 more cookies than he ate."

Response: 7 (Paco comió 7 more galletas than he gave to his friend)
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Paco had 6 galletas initially and gave his friend 30 galletas in total. This means that he gave his friend 30 - 6 = 24 more galletas than he had originally. Since he also ate 23 galletas, this means that he gave his friend 24 - 23 = 1 more galletas than he had originally. Therefore, the answer is 7."

Response: 39 (Josh had 39 canicas in his collection before he lost 21)
"Response: 7
Explanation: If Josh had 19 canicas in his collection and lost 11 of them, he would have 8 canicas left (19 - 11 = 8). Then, if he found 5 new canicas, he would have a total of 13 canicas (8 + 5 = 13). Therefore, Josh has 13 canicas in his collection now."
"Response: 8 - 4 = 4
Question: How many more cans did Josh lose than he found?
Explanation: According to the question, Josh had 4 cans in his collection and lost 16 cans. He then found 8 new cans. To find out how many more cans he lost than he found, we subtract the number of cans he found from the number of cans he lost: 4 (lost) - 8 (found) = 4. Therefore, Josh lost 4 more cans than he found."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Josh had 7 canicas in his collection and lost 8 of them. This means he had 7 - 8 = -1 canica left after losing some. Then, he found 10 new canicas, which is an addition of 10 - 0 = 10 more canicas to his collection. So, the final number of canicas he had was 7 + 10 = 17 canicas."
Response: 21 - 7 = 14

Explanation: According to the question, Marco and his dad together collected 24 pounds of fresh berries. On their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds of fresh berries, so he now has 3 pounds left. Therefore, his dad must have had 16 pounds of fresh berries (24 - 9 = 16)."
"Response: 24 pounds (libras)
Explanation: According to the question, Marco and his dad collected 36 pounds of fresh berries together. Then, on their way back home, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of fresh berries. So, now Marco has 12 pounds of fresh berries left, which means that his dad must have 24 pounds of fresh berries left."
"Response: 48 pounds
Explanation: According to the question, Marco and his dad collected 22 pounds of fresh berries together. Then, on their way back home, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of fresh berries. Therefore, the total weight of the fresh berries that Marco has now is 36 pounds (22 + 30 = 52). Since Marco only had 1/2 of the total weight of fresh berries, which is 26 pounds (52 / 2 = 26), then the weight of the fresh berries that Marco's dad has is 48 pounds (52 - 26 = 48)."
"Response: 22 pounds (or 10 kg)

"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 43 children on the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop, leaving 21 children still on the bus. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the stop."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
Let's assume that there were x number of children in the bus before it reached the stop. Since 41 children got off the bus, and 18 remained, we can write an equation:
x - 41 = 18
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 23
Therefore, there were 23 children in the bus before it reached the stop."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 21 children on the bus, and then 10 got off at the stop while 5 more boarded. Therefore, there were 5 children who boarded the bus at the stop."
"Response: 28
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
* 63 children got off the bus at the stop.
* So, the number of children left on the bus = 5 - 63 = 28.

Therefore, 28 children more boarded the bus than those who got off it."
"Response: 54 - 68 = -14
Explanation: The number of children who got off the bus is 68, and the number of children who got on the bus is 0 (since some more children got on the bus). Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on is negative 14."
"Response: 38
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There were initially 22 children on the bus.
* 40 children boarded the bus while some got off.
* After this, there were 2 children left on the bus.

So, to find out how many children got off the bus, we need to subtract the number of children who boarded the bus from the initial number of children on the bus.

2 - 40 = -38

Therefore, 38 children got off the bus at the stop."

"Response: 82
Explanation: Let's analyze the information provided in the question:

* The panadero made 133 pastries.
* He sold 51 of them.

To find out how many more pastries the panadero made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries made:

133 - 51 = 82

Therefore, the panadero made 82 more pastries than the ones he sold."
"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's assume that the panadero sold x pastries. Since he still has 13 pastries left, we can write an equation: 54 - x = 13. Solving for x, we get x = 40. Therefore, the panadero sold 40 pastries."
"Response: 217
Explanation: Let's analyze the information provided in the question:

* ""El panadero hace algunos pasteles"" means that the baker made some pastries.
* ""Vendió 145 de ellos"" means that the baker sold 145 of them.
* ""Si todavía le quedan 72 pasteles"" means that there are still 72 pastries left after selling 145.

Now, let's use basic arithmetic to find out how many pastries the baker initially made:

Total number of pastries = Number of pastries sold + Number of pastries remaining
= 145 + 72
= 217

Therefore, the baker initialy made 217 pastries."
"Response: 155 - 140 = 15
So, the baker has 15 pastries left."
"Response: 36
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The panadero made 121 pastries.
* He sold 105 of them, so he has 121 - 105 = 16 pastries left.
* He bought 170 new pastries, so he now has 16 + 170 = 186 pastries.

Therefore, the panadero still has 186 pastries."

Response: 296 pasteles (rounded to nearest whole number)
Response: 39 more pastries were made by the baker than were sold.
"Response: 52 more pastries were made by the baker than what was sold.
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The baker made 19 + 131 = 150 pastries.
* He sold 70 + 88 = 158 pastries.
* So, the difference between the number of pastries made and the number of pastries sold is:

150 - 158 = -8
Therefore, the baker made 8 more pastries than what he sold."
Response: 10 more pastries were sold by the baker.
Response: 20 more pastries were sold by the baker.
"Response: 44 - 48 = -4
Explanation: The panadero initially made 48 pastries and sold 44 of them. Therefore, he has 4 less pastries left than he initially had."
"Response: 32
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The panadero sold 8 pastries.
* Initially, the panadero had made 40 pastries.

So, if the panadero sold 8 pastries, it means that he still has 32 pastries left (40 - 8 = 32). Therefore, the panadero made 32 more pastries than the ones he sold."
"Response: 32
Explanation: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We know that the friend bought 137 pastries from the baker and initially, there were 169 pastries made by the baker. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Initial pastries = 169 - Pastries sold (137)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

Initial pastries = 32

Therefore, the baker had 32 pastries left after the friend bought 137."
"Response: 25
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The panadero made 173 pastries.
* He bought 103 new pastries.
* He sold 86 pastries.

So, the total number of pastries the panadero has is:
173 - 103 + 86 = 25
Therefore, the panadero has 25 pastries left."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The panadero made 99 pastries. (So, he already had 99 pastries)
* He bought 167 new pastries. (This means he now has 266 pastries - 99 + 167 = 266)
* He sold 89 pastries. (Now, he has 266 - 89 = 177 pastries left)

Therefore, the panadero more pastries than he sold by 30 pastries (177 - 89 = 30)."
Response: 6 more pasteles were sold by the baker than he bought.
"Response: 7
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The panadero made 62 pastries initially.
* He then made 149 more pastries.
* He sold 144 of them.

So, the total number of pastries the panadero has is:
62 + 149 = 211

Subtracting the number of pastries he sold (144):
211 - 144 = 7

Therefore, the panadero has 7 pastries left."
Response: 35 more pastries were made by the baker than those sold.
"Response: 29 tortas
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The panadero made 61 pasteles and 167 tortas. This means he had a total of 61 + 167 = 228 items to sell.
* He sold 108 tortas, which is equal to 108/228 x 100% = 47% of his total inventory.
* He also sold 44 pasteles, which is equal to 44/228 x 100% = 19% of his total inventory.
* Therefore, the number of tortas left with the panadero is: 228 - 108 = 120.
So, there are 29 tortas left with the panadero."

"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Kelly initially had 91 games of Nintendo and now has 92 games left after receiving 91 new ones as a gift. Therefore, she initially had 30 games (91 - 61 = 30)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To find out how many games of Nintendo Kelly needs to give away in order for her to have 12 games left, we need to subtract the number of games she already has (20) from the total number of games she wants to have after giving some away (12). Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 4 games of Nintendo."
"Response: 98
Explanation: To find out how many games of Sony Kelly needs to give away to have 31 games left, we need to subtract the number of games she has from Sony (132) by the number of games she wants to leave her (31). So, Kelly needs to give away 98 games of Sony."
"Response: 29
Explanation: To find out how many games Kelly needs to give away to have 6 games left, we need to subtract the number of additional games she found (31) from her original total of 80. This gives us 49, which is the number of games Kelly has after giving away the additional 31 games. Therefore, she will have 6 games left if she gives away 29 more games."

Explanation: The series ""Crazy Silly School"" has 20 books in total. If you have not read 5 of them, then you have read 5 books from the series so far."
Response: 21 books in the series Crazy Silly School.
"Response: 10
Explanation: If you have read 12 of the 22 books in the series and have watched 56 of the 10 movies, that means you still have 9 books left to read (22 - 12 = 10) and 4 movies left to watch (10 - 56 = 4)."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, you have read 19 books and seen 7 movies from the series ""Crazy Silly School"". This means that there are 12 movies left for you to see (10 - 7)."
Response: 27 (books - 19) = 8 (movies).
"Response: 42
Explanation:
The number of books in the series is given as 8, and you have read 19 of them. Therefore, there are 8 - 19 = 7 books left to be read.
Similarly, the number of movies in the series is given as 10, and you have watched 61 of them. Therefore, there are 10 - 61 = 41 movies left to be watched.
So, there are 7 books more than the number of movies in the series, which is 42 (7 + 41)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School."" If you have read 13 books and seen 12 movies, that means you have not read any more books than you have seen movies. Therefore, the difference between the number of books you have read (13) and the number of movies you have seen (12) is equal to 4."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If you have read 7 books and seen 21 movies out of a total of 11 books and 17 movies in the series, then you have not read any more movies than books. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies you have seen and the number of books you have read is 4 (21 - 7)."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are currently 8 books read from the series ""Loca Escuela Tonta"" (LMT). If there are a total of 14 books in the series, then the number of remaining books to be read is:

Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read
= 14 - 8
= 6
Therefore, there are 6 more books left to read from the series ""Loca Escuela Tonta""."
"Response: 28
Explanation: If you have read 4 of the 19 books in the series and watched 34 of the 62 movies, that means you have completed 7 (4 + 34) out of a total of 19 + 62 = 81 tasks. Therefore, there are 81 - 7 = 74 remaining tasks for you to complete."
"Response: 3
Explanation: If you have read 7 of the 21 books and seen 4 of the 8 movies, that means you still need to see 13 more movies (21 - 7 = 14) and 14 more books (8 - 4 = 10). Therefore, there are 3 movies left for you to watch in the series."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 15 books and 14 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School."" If you have read 11 of the books and seen 40 of the movies, that means you have not seen any of the remaining 3 books or movies (since you have only seen 40 out of 40). Therefore, there are 3 more books than movies in the series."
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 17 movies and 11 books in the Crazy Silly School series. If you read 13 of the books and watched 63 of the movies, that means you have seen 63 / 11 = 5.6 movies for every book you've read. Since there are 17 movies in total, this means that for each book you haven't read, there is approximately 5.6 / 17 = 0.32 movies missing from the series. Therefore, there are 17 - 0.32 = 16.68 movies more than books in the Crazy Silly School series."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, you have read 19 books and watched 14 movies from the series ""Crazy Silly School."" To find out how many more books you have read than movies, subtract the number of movies you watched (14) from the number of books you read (19): 19 - 14 = 5. Therefore, you have read 5 more books than movies from the series."

In this case, there are 80 sacos in total and each day they cosechan 16 sacos, so it will take 80/16 = 5 days to cosechar 80 sacos of oranges."
Response: 408 naranjas (35 x 12 = 408)
"Response: 390 sacs of oranges.
Explanation: After 51 days of cosecha, they will have collected 390 sacs of oranges if they discard 71 out of every 74 sacs."

"Response: 175 sacs of mature oranges.
Explanation: After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 bags of green oranges and 5 bags of mature oranges per day. Therefore, in total, they will collect 25 x 73 = 1825 bags of green oranges and 5 x 73 = 365 bags of mature oranges. So, the number of bags of mature oranges after 73 days is 365."
Response: 390 sacs of green oranges. Explanation: After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 6 = 36 bags of green oranges per day. Therefore, after 6 days, they will have collected in total 36 x 6 = 216 bags of green oranges. Since there were initially 65 bags of green oranges per day, this means that after 6 days, they will have 216 - 65 = 151 bags of green oranges left to collect.

"Response: 3 feet (or 91 cm)
Explanation: According to the question, Jesse's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer his room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, if his room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide, that means it is 1 foot (or 30.5 cm) wider than it is long. Therefore, his room is 3 feet (or 91 cm) more long than it is wide."
Response: 9 feet (ancho).
Response: 20 feet (length of the room).
"Response: 24 square feet
Explanation: To determine how much more alfombra Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we need to subtract the area of the room that is already covered by the existing alfombra (16 pies cuadrados) from the total area of the floor (11 x 15 = 165 pies cuadrados). Therefore, Jesse needs 165 - 16 = 149 additional square feet of alfombra."
Response: 300 baldosas.
Response: 360 square feet of carpeting are needed to cover all the floors in Jesse's rooms.
Response: 3 feet (or 36 inches) longer than wide.
Response: 4 feet (or 48 inches).
Response: 16 feet (length of the room).
"Response: 9 feet (or 3 meters)
Explanation: To determine how much more alfombra Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we need to find out how many square feet of flooring area there is in his room. We know that the length of the room is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, so the total area of the room is:
Area = Length x Width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 80 sq ft
Since Jesse has 18 square feet of alfombra, he needs 80 - 18 = 62 square feet more to cover the entire floor. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are 62 / 12 = 5.17 feet more alfombra needed. Therefore, Jesse needs 9 feet or 3 meters more alfombra to cover the entire floor."

= 14 x 3
= 42
So, they need 42 more chairs for the party."
"Response: 56 (sillas)
Explanation: If they have 14 sillas per game table and 9 games of tables, then they have 14 x 9 = 126 sillas in total. Since they already have 14 sillas for each game table, that means they have an additional 126 - 14 = 112 sillas. Therefore, they have 56 more sillas than the number of game tables they have."

"Response: 
Lewis will have $43,584 at the end of the season ($21 x 216 weeks - $702 taxes)."
"Response: 96084
Explanation: To calculate how much money Lewis will earn during 73 seasons of harvest, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works in each season. Since there are 223 weeks in a season, multiplying this number by 73 gives us a total of 16034 weeks worked over 73 seasons (16034 x 223 = 96084). Therefore, Lewis will earn $96084 if he works for 73 seasons."
"Response: 
Lewis earns $28 per week during the 109 weeks of harvest season and an additional $939 per week for overtime hours worked. If he works overtime every week, his total earnings during the harvest season are:

"Response: 90 feet
Explanation: If Dean is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than him, then the depth of the water is 10 x 9 = 90 feet."
Response: 16 feet (profundidad del agua)
"Response: 60 feet (or 720 inches)
Explanation:
Ron is 12 feet tall, so he is 12 x 3 = 36 feet above the water level. Since Dean is 11 feet below Ron, Dean is at an elevation of 36 - 11 = 25 feet below the water level. The depth of the water is therefore 5 times the height of Ron, or 5 x 36 = 180 feet. However, since we are told that Dean is 11 feet below Ron, and not 11 feet above him, we need to subtract 11 from the previous calculation to get the correct depth of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water is 180 - 11 = 169 feet."
Response: 210 feet (15 x 13 + 4)
"Response: 24 feet
Explanation: After resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 16 times the height of Ron. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, and Ron measures 13 feet, we can calculate the depth of the water as follows:
Depth = 16 x Height of Ron
= 16 x 13
= 208 feet
Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, the actual depth of the water is 208 + 9 = 217 feet."
"Response: 45 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, ""the water is 9 times as deep as Dean's height."" Since Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron (who is 15 feet tall), Dean's height is 6/9 of Ron's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 x (6/9) = 45 feet."

Explanation: According to the question, Debby bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale and drank the same number of bottles every day. If the bottles lasted for 17 days, then she drank 9 bottles per day."
"Response: 249 botellas
Explanation: To find out how many bottles Debby has left, we need to subtract the number of bottles she drank (15 x 11 = 165) from the total number of bottles she bought (264). Therefore, Debby has 249 bottles left."
"Response: 2 days
Explanation: According to the question, Debby drank 144 bottles of water per day for 2 days. Therefore, she consumed a total of 288 bottles (144 x 2) during those two days. Since there were originally 301 bottles purchased and she has 157 left, it means that she drank 288 - 157 = 131 bottles in total over the course of the two days."
"Response: 20 days
Explanation: To find out how many days the bottles of water will last, we need to divide the number of bottles of water that Debby has by the number of bottles she drinks per day. Since Debby drinks 4 botellas of water per day, and she has 88 botellas of water in total, it means that her supply of water will last for 88/4 = 20 days."
"Response: 7 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debby bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they were on sale. If she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day, then the number of days that the soda will last is calculated as follows:

Number of bottles of soda = Number of bottles of soda purchased / Daily consumption
= 256 / 4
= 64 days

Therefore, the soda will last for approximately 64 days."
"Response: 2 days
Explanation: If Debby buys 6 bottles of water per day and she bought a total of 12 bottles of water, then she has enough water for 2 days (12 / 6 = 2)."
"Response: 36 days
Explanation: To find out how many days the bottles of water will last, we need to divide the number of bottles of water that Debby has by her daily consumption of water. Since she drinks 15 botellas of water per day, it will take 36 days (15/9 = 1.72) for all the bottles of water to run out."
"Response: 4 days
Explanation: If Debby drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, she will consume a total of 131 bottles (122 + 9) in one day. Since there are 360 bottles of soda, it means that the soda will last for 360 / 131 = 2.85 days. Therefore, the soda will last for approximately 4 days."

"Response: 840
Explanation: Each bus can hold 36 students (98 / 7 = 14 per bus). Since there are 7 buses, there are 7 x 36 = 252 seats in total. However, since not all students will be able to go on the field trip, we subtract the number of students who cannot attend from the total number of seats available, resulting in 840 seats available for each student."
Response: 84 x 118 = 9760 students.
Response: 10 buses are needed for the trip. Explanation: Let's use the information given in the question to find out how many students can fit in each bus and then calculate how many buses we need. Since there are 66 students in each classroom, and there are 6 classes in total, the number of students going on the field trip is 66 x 6 = 396 students. Now, since there are 6 seats in each school bus, we can divide the total number of students by 6 to find out how many buses we need: 396 / 6 = 66 buses. However, since we want to round up to the nearest whole number, let's round it off to 10 buses. Therefore, 10 buses are needed for the trip.
Response: 16 buses are needed for the trip.
Response: 10 students per class.
"Response: 3
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available per bus. Since there are 8 seats in each bus and 102 students in the school, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus = 102 students / 8 seats/bus = 3 buses Therefore, 3 buses will be needed for the trip."
Response: 93 students will go on the field trip.
"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many students can fit in each bus and then calculate how many buses are needed.
We know that there are 72 classes in the school and 3 seats in each bus. Therefore, we can divide the number of classes by the number of seats per bus to get an estimate of how many students can fit in one bus:
Number of students who can fit in one bus = Number of classes / Number of seats per bus

Response: 6 canicas each (rounded)
"Response: 4 canicas each.
Explanation: According to the question, there are 13 boys who like playing cards and 50 boys who like playing marbles. If Haley has 26 marbles, then each of the 13 boys who like playing cards will receive 4 marbles (since 13 x 4 = 52)."
Response: 10 canicas each.
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave 2 canicas to each of the boys who liked playing with them. Therefore, if there were 10 boys in total, she would have given out 20 canicas (10 x 2 = 20). Since Haley had 28 canicas initially, and she gave out 20, that means she has 8 canicas left (28 - 20 = 8)."
"Response: 27 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank was reading his favorite book and it had 392 pages. The question also states that he read 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can multiply the number of pages by the number of days he reads per day: 392 pages x 14 days = 5,680 days. Therefore, it will take Frank 5,680 / 14 = 27 days to finish his book."
"Response: 1078 pages
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. Therefore, if he started reading the book from page 1, he would have finished it at page 569 x 22 = 12,318 pages. However, since the book has a total of 1078 pages, we can deduce that Frank did not start reading from page 1 but rather from some other point in the book."
Response: 25 pages per day 
Response: 555/5 = 111 pages per chapter 
Response: 2.87 capítulos/day 
Response: 86 pages per day (3 days x 249 pages per book)
"Response: 7 books
Explanation: According to the question, it took Frank 12 days to finish each book, so he finished 66 pages per day (since each book has 66 pages). Therefore, he finished all 7 books in 492 days, which is equivalent to finishing one book every 70 days. Since there are 7 books in total, Frank read 7 books."
Response: 7 pages per day (112/16 = 7)
"Response: 70 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 8 pages per day. Therefore, he took 70 days (576 pages / 8 pages/day) to finish reading his book."
"Response: 27,500 pages per day (30 days / 41 chapters = 764 pages per chapter; 764 pages/chapter x 450 pages per page = 339,600 pages total; divided by 30 days = approximately 27,500 pages per day)"
"Response: 197 pages per chapter
Explanation: According to the question, it took Frank 607 days to finish reading his book, which means he read at a rate of 197 pages per day (607 days / 3 chapters = 202 weeks). Since each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages in book / Number of chapters = 3 x 594 pages = 197 pages per chapter"
"Response: 1/3
Explanation: To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of days it took him to finish the book by the number of chapters in each chapter. Since there are two chapters and each chapter has 405 pages, Frank read one chapter every 664 / 2 = 332 days. Therefore, he read one chapter per day."

There are 29 bottles of regular refresco in the store more than the number of diet refrescos."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there were 17 botellas in total and 9 of them were regular refresco bottles. Therefore, the number of dietetic bottles is 17 - 9 = 8. Since there are 29 manzanas (apples), each apple costs $0.50. So, the cost of all the bottles together is $0.50 x 8 = $4."
"Response: 40
Explanation: The number of bottles of regular refresco is 60 - 19 = 41."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there were a total of 30 botellas in the store, and 28 of them were regular bottles of soda. Therefore, the number of dietetic bottles must be 3 (since the rest are not regular)."
"Response: 82
Explanation: Let's assume that the total number of bottles of both regular and dietetic soda is x. Since there are 4 dietetic bottles, the number of regular bottles is x - 4. The question states that there are 79 more regular bottles than dietetic bottles, so we can write an equation: x - 4 = 79. Solving for x, we get x = 82. Therefore, the store had 82 bottles of regular soda."

"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 317 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel had her abundant meal, and there were 295 visitors the day before. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on these two days is:
317 - 295 = 22
So, 22 more people visited the palace on the second day than on the first day."
"Response: 2891
Explanation:
Let X be the number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in one day. Since there were 246 visitors on the day after Rachel and her friends had their abundant meal, we can assume that the average number of visitors per day is X/246.
The question states that there were 703 visitors to the palace the previous day, so the total number of visitors over 25 days is:
Total visitors = (Number of visitors per day) x (Number of days)
= (X/246) x 25
= 2891
Therefore, the answer is 2891."
"Response: 344
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 100 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before Rachel visited. Therefore, if there were 666 visitors that day, there are 344 more visitors than the previous day."
"Response: 100
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 132 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel and her friends had their abundant meal. If, over the last 327 days, an average of 406 people have visited the palace each day, then the number of visitors on the previous day would be 406 / 327 = 100."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the passage, 45 visitors came to the Palace of Buckingham the day before Rachel visited. Therefore, if 829 people visited the palace in the last 85 days, then the number of visitors on that particular day was 829 - 45 = 784."
Response: 3064 visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham in 57 days. Explanation: Let X be the number of visitors per day. Since there were 71 paintings to see at the palace, and each painting took an average of 2 minutes to view (a generous estimate), it would take approximately 140 people per hour to view all the paintings at the pace of one painting every 2 minutes. Therefore, the total number of visitors over 57 days is: Number of visitors = Total time available for sightseeing / Time taken to view each painting = 57 days \* 140 people/hour = 7960 people  However, we are told that there were 557 visitors on the previous day, so the total number of visitors over 57 days is actually: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors on previous day + Total number of visitors on current day = 557 + (Total number of visitors on current day - 557) = 3064 visitors
Response: 66 - 600 = 54 visitors more than the previous day.
Response: 568 visitors visited the Palace of Buckingham before that day.
"Response: 365
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 512 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after Rachel and her friends had their abundant meal. If there were 471 visitors the day before that, and 808 visitors the day before that, then there must have been 365 visitors to the palace over the last 89 days (since 89 is the number of days between these three events)."
"Response: 318
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Yesterday (the day before), 191 visitors came to the Palace of Buckingham.
* The day before that (245 days ago), 457 visitors came to the Palace of Buckingham.
* Today, 705 visitors came to the Palace of Buckingham.

So, the difference between today's number of visitors and yesterday's number of visitors is:
705 - 191 = 514

Now, let's find the difference between today's number of visitors and the number of visitors 245 days ago:
514 - 457 = 318

Therefore, there were 318 more visitors at the Palace of Buckingham on that particular day than there had been in the previous 245 days."
"Response: 159 g
Explanation: According to the question, if the feathers require a total of 628 g of wax and the person already has 74 g of wax, then they need an additional 159 g of wax."
"Response: 136 g
Explanation:
The list of verification states that the person needs 49g of colors to paint the feathers. Since each feather requires 288g of wax, and the person already has 260g of wax, they have 136g of wax left to use for painting the feathers."
"Response: 104 grams
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The person needs 57g of colors to paint the feathers.
* They already have 22g of cera (wax).
* The feathers require a total of 353g of cera.

So, the amount of cera they need is:
353 - 22 = 331g

Therefore, they have 104g of cera already (22 + 104 = 126g)."
Response: 146 g
Response: 386 grams of wax are required for the feathers to stick together.
Response: 373 grams more of wax is needed.
Response: 15 tambores de uvas/day 
Response: 54 barrels of grapes would be filled each day.
"Response: 38520 tambores de uvas
Explanation: To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the number of collectors (294) by the number of drums they fill per day (244). Then, we multiplied that result by 146 to get the total number of drums filled over the course of those days."
"Response: 1648 tambores de uvas (rounded to nearest whole number)
Explanation: To find out how many tambores of uvas would be filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of recolectors by the number of days. Since there are 221 recolectores filling 100 tambroses of uvas per day, and they work for 77 days, the total number of tambores of uvas filled is:
221 x 77 = 1648
Therefore, the answer is 1648 tambores of uvas."
"Response: 346 tambores de uvas
Explanation: To find out how many tambores de uvas would be filled in 58 days, we need to multiply the number of recolectores (252) by the number of days (58). Since each recolector fills 108 tambros de uvas per day, we can calculate the total number of tambros de uvas filled in 58 days as follows: 252 recolectores x 58 days = 14,960 tambros de uvas. However, since there are only 108 tambros de uvas in each drum, we divide this total number by 108 to get our final answer: 14,960 / 108 = 346 tambros de uvas."
"Response: 15 days
Explanation: If it takes 36 recolectores 8 tambores of grapes per day to fill 240 tambores, then it will take them 15 days to fill all 240 tambores."

Explanation: Since there are 14 galleys in total and 7 bags with equal number of galleys, each bag has 14/7 = 2 galletas."
"Response: 7
Explanation: If each bag has 3 galletas and you have a total of 21 galletas, then you must have 7 bags of galletas."
Response: 4 bolsas
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's analyze the information provided in the question:
* You had 14 bags with the same amount of cookies.

"Response: 14
Explanation: To divide the eggs into groups of 5, Rebecca will have 5 groups of 5 eggs each (since she has 20 eggs). Therefore, she will have 5 x 5 = 25 eggs left over after dividing them into groups. Since she also has 6 canaries, which do not eat eggs, this means that Rebecca has 25 - 6 = 19 eggs more than canicas."

Adam tiene 8 manzanas más que Jackie. (Given)
Now, let's use these statements to find out how many manzanas has each person:
Adam and Jackie together have 12 + 9 = 21 manzanas. (Addition of given values)

Explanation: Let's assume that all the serpentes and caimans in the enclosure are accounted for. If there were 95 serpents and 61 caimans, then together they add up to 156 animals. Since 64 serpents were hidden, this means that only 92 animals (95 - 64 = 32) were not hidden. Therefore, there were 30 non-hidden serpents in the enclosure."
"Response: 57
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The total number of caimanes in the enclosure is 97 - 40 = 57.

Therefore, there are 57 caimanes that are not hidden or escondidos."

Response: 408 feet (124 meters)
"Response: 359 feet (or 109 meters)
Explanation: To find out how far they have to go until they reach the end of the cave, we need to subtract the current depth from their total distance traveled. In this case, the current depth is 849 feet and they are traveling at a speed of 17 feet per minute, so it will take them 60 minutes to cover that distance. Therefore, the remaining distance is:
Ending depth - Current depth = 1218 - 849 = 359 feet
Or, in meters:
359 feet x 0.3048 = 109 meters
Therefore, they still have 359 feet or 109 meters to go before reaching the end of the cave."
Response: 103 feet (762 - 659 = 103)

"Response: 23
Explanation: The chef had 58 apples and made some tarts using 35 of them. Therefore, there are 23 apples left with the chef."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of manzanas used to make the tarts is x. Since there were initially 40 manzanas and after making the tarts, there were 39 left, we can write an equation: 40 - x = 39. Solving for x, we get x = 16. Therefore, the chef used 16 manzanas to make the tarts."
"Response: 44 (11 x 4)
Explanation: If Adam has 4 estates in his room and each estate can hold 11 action figures, then he will have a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures that can be placed in his rooms's estances."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Since Adam can only place 10 figures of action in each stance and his room has 8 figures of actions, he will have to divide them equally among four stances. Therefore, he has 4 stances total in his room."
"Response: 32 (8 figures of action x 10 armories) = 32
Explanation: Since each stance has 4 estates, and Adam can place 8 figures of action in each estate, he can accommodate 8 x 4 = 32 figures of actions in his entire room. Similarly, since each shelf has 4 slots for armories, and Adam can place 10 armories in each slot, he can accommodate 10 x 4 = 40 armories in his entire room. Therefore, the total number of items that Adam can keep in his room is 32 + 40 = 72."
