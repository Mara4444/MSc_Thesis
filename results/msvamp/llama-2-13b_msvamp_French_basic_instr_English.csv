Response: 253 (number of boys in the school).
"Response: 475 boys (calculation below)

Explanation: Let X be the number of girls in the school. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can write an equation based on this information:
X + 228 = total number of students
We know that the total number of students is 697, so we can substitute X + 228 for 697:
X + 228 = 697
Subtracting 228 from both sides gives us:
X = 475
Therefore, there are 475 girls in the school. To find out how many boys there are, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:
Total number of students - Number of girls = Number of boys
697 - 475 = 222
Therefore, there are 222 boys in the school."

Response: 3 pêches (Jill has 3 more peaches than Jake).
"Response: 
Jake has 7 less than Steven and 9 more than Jill. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Let S be the number of peaches that Steven has.
Jake has 7 fewer than Steven, so Jake's number of peaches is:

J = S - 7... (1)

Jill has 9 fewer than Jake, so Jill's number of peaches is:

Jill = J - 9... (2)

We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute this value into equation (1):

J = 16 - 7
J = 9

Now we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find Jill's number of peaches:

Jill = 9 - 9
Jill = 0

So, Jake has 9 peaches, and Jill has 0 peaches."
"Response: 
Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 17 peaches, then Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 peaches. Since Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill, Jill has 10 + 8 = 18 peaches."

"Response: 89 pêches (calculation below)

Question: If Jill has 67 more peaches than Jake and Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, how many peaches does Jake have?

Formula to solve this problem is as follows:
Let X be the number of peaches that Jake has.
Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, we can write an equation based on that fact:
X = S - 4
where S is the number of peaches that Steven has.
We know that Jill has 67 more peaches than Jake, so we can write another equation based on that fact:
X + 67 = J
where J is the number of peaches that Jill has.
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (X and J). We can use substitution or elimination method to find out the value of X. Let's use substitution method.
Solving the first equation for X, we get:
X = S - 4
Substituting S = 12 (since Steven has 12 peaches), we get:
X = 12 - 4
X = 8
Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches."

So, it will take 5 days to collect 80 bags of oranges."
"Response: 420 oranges (67 x 12 = 804; 804 - 35 = 420)."
"Response: 3628 sacs of oranges (calculation below).

Explanation:
To calculate the total number of sacs of oranges after 51 days of harvesting, we need to know the daily production and the percentage that is thrown away.

Daily Production = 74 sacs/day
Percentage Thrown Away = 71%

Since they throw away 71% of the produced oranges, we can calculate the actual number of sacs kept for sale by multiplying the daily production by the remaining percentage:

Actual Number of Sacs Kept = Daily Production x Remaining Percentage
= 74 x 29%
= 21

Now, we can calculate the total number of sacs of oranges after 51 days of harvesting by multiplying the actual number of sacs kept per day by the number of days:

Total Number of Sacs = Actual Number of Sacs Kept x Number of Days
= 21 x 51
= 1051

Therefore, after 51 days of harvesting, they will have 1051 sacs of oranges."
Response: 1200 oranges per day.

"Response: 43 buses are needed to transport all 58 students.  
Explanation: Since there are 87 classrooms and each room has two seats available in the school bus, we can calculate the total number of seats required as follows:
Total Seats = Number of Classrooms x Number of Students per Room
= 87 x 2
= 174 seats
Since there are 58 students in the school, we need to divide the total number of seats by the number of students to determine how many buses are required:
Number of Buses = Total Seats / Number of Students
= 174 / 58
= 3
Therefore, 3 buses are needed to transport all 58 students."

"Response: 40 buses are necessary for the school trip.  
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed, we need to divide the number of students by the number of seats in each bus. In this case, there are 111 students and 3 seats per bus, so we can calculate as follows:

111 students / 3 seats per bus = 37 buses
Since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 40 buses. Therefore, 40 buses are necessary for the school trip."

"Response: 
To determine how many planches John needs for the wall of the house, we need to divide the number of clous by the number of clous required per planche. In this case, there are 4 clous and each planche requires 2 clous, so:

4 clous / 2 clous per planche = 2 planches
Therefore, John needs 2 planches for the wall of the house."

"Response: 
To determine how many planches John needs for the wall of the house, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for all the great and small planches combined. Then, dividing that number by the number of nails per planche will give us the total number of planches needed.

Total number of nails = (12 x 14) + (17 x 25)
= 168 + 425
= 693

Number of planches = Total number of nails / Number of nails per planche
= 693 / 14
= 50

Therefore, John needs 50 planches for the wall of the house."
