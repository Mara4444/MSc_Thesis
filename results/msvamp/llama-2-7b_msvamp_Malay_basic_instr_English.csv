"Response: 37
Explanation:
The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter.
48 - 11 = 37
Therefore, there are 37 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter."
"Response: 43
Explanation:
The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:
80 - 37 = 43
Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter."
"Response: 17
Explanation:
Let's assume that the total number of pages in the book is x. Since the first chapter has 60 pages, we know that x - 60 = 93 (the total number of pages in the book minus the number of pages in the first chapter). Therefore, x = 170 (since there are 93 pages in the second chapter and 170 - 60 = 110 pages left for the remaining chapters)."
Response: 40 halaman
Response: 109 halaman
Response:  The number of pages more in the first chapter than in the second chapter is 68 pages (91 - 23 = 68).
"Response: 40

The third chapter has 3 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is 53 + 3 = 56 pages. Therefore, there are 40 more pages in the second chapter than in the third chapter."
Response:  The number of pages more in the first chapter than in the third chapter is 40 (53 - 21 = 40).
Response:  The book has 31 chapters, and each chapter is 61 pages long, so the total number of pages in the book is 31 x 61 = 1831 pages.

Response: 30 epal (since 4 x 7 = 28, and there are already 4 epal taken by Rachel)
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel initially had 4 epal pada mulanya (initially there were 4 epal). Then she took some of them and now there are only 2 epal left at the tree (now there are only 2 epal remaining). Therefore, the number of epal that Rachel took is 4 - 2 = 3."
Response:  There are currently 2 epal (uncooked peanuts) left on the tree.
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel took 2 ripe mangoes from her tree. Now, there are still 7 unripe mangoes left on the tree. If 6 of them ripen and the remaining ones do not ripen, then there will be 3 ripe mangoes left on the tree."
Response:  The number of epal that the tree has produced is 8 (6 + 2).
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are currently 3 epal matang (ripe) and 2 epal that have not yet ripened from Rachel's tree. To determine how many epal the tree needs to produce to make up for the loss of the ripe ones, we can use simple arithmetic. The total number of epal needed is calculated by subtracting the number of ripe epal from the total number of epal on the tree, which is 27 - 3 = 24. Therefore, the tree needs to produce 24 new epal to compensate for the lost ripe ones."
Response:  The number of palm fruits that Rachel picked from her tree is 7. After she picked them, two new fruits grew on the same tree, bringing the total number of fruits to 6. Therefore, the number of palm fruits that Rachel's tree produced after she picked some is 6 + 2 = 8.
"Response: 10
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, there were initially 2 epal on Rachel's pokok. Then, Rachel took 4 epal from her pokok, leaving 2 epal remaining.

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that out of 408 students who participated in the survey, 42 students preferred to add beef to their meal. Therefore, the number of students who preferred kentang tumbuk (potato fritters) is 408 - 42 = 366."
"Response: 526

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 479 students who prefer to add potatoes and 489 students who prefer to add meat to their meals. Since both groups have more than 400 members, we can say that the total number of students is greater than or equal to 400 + 400 = 800. Therefore, the answer is 526 (since this is the largest integer less than or equal to 800)."
"Response: 47

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that out of 310 students, 185 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu. Therefore, the number of students who did not suggest adding potatoes is 310 - 185 = 125.
Since some of these students may have also suggested other food items, let's assume that there are X number of students who suggested daging (meat) in addition to those who suggested potatoes.
We know that the total number of students who suggested meat or potatoes is 125 + X, since each student can only suggest one item.
Therefore, the number of students who suggested daging is X / 2, since they could have either suggested daging or potatoes.
So, the answer is 47 students."
Response: 50
"Response: 120
Explanation: According to the question, out of 457 students who participated in the survey, 63 more students preferred adding mashed potatoes than those who preferred adding beef. Therefore, if 63 is divided by 457, it results in a decimal value of 0.138 or approximately 120 students."
"Response: 166
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 182 students who suggested adding food to the school menu. Of these, 166 students suggested adding more meat than potatoes. Therefore, if 166 students are more than those who suggest adding potatoes, then the number of students who suggest adding meat is greater than the number of students who suggest adding potatoes."
"Response: 506
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 324 students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu, and 374 students who suggested adding meat. Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding something new to the menu is 324 + 374 = 798.
However, since some students may have suggested multiple options (e.g., both potatoes and meat), we need to adjust this number accordingly. Based on the question, it seems that each student can suggest only one option, so we will divide the total number of suggestions by the number of students who participated in suggesting new options, which is 798 / 506 = 506.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 506."
Response:  Of the 257 students who suggested food items, 120 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu, which is 46% of the total number of suggestions.  
Response: 50% of the students who suggested potatoes were also the ones who suggested adding meat to the menu, and 23% of the students who suggested potatoes were also the ones who suggested adding tomatoes. Therefore, if 144 students suggested potatoes, then 79 students (or 50%) of them also suggested adding meat, and 38 students (or 23%) of them also suggested adding tomatoes.
"Response: 165
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 228 students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu. Among them, 337 students suggested adding meat to the menu. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding meat is 337 - 228 = 109.
Now, let's find out how many students suggested adding tomato. According to the question, among the 23 students who suggested adding something, 20 suggested adding tomato. So, the number of students who suggested adding tomato is 20/23 = 87%.
Therefore, the final answer is 165 (109 + 87%)."
Response:  The number of students who took part in deciding the new menu is 450.
Response:  The number of students who requested to add pork is 351.
"Response: 148
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that out of 269 students who suggested adding beef to the menu, 330 students suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is 330 - 269 = 61.
Similarly, from the second part of the question, we know that out of 76 students who suggested adding vegetables, 76 - 53 = 23 students suggested adding tomatoes.
Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding vegetables (including both potatoes and tomatoes) is 61 + 23 = 148."

Therefore, if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, he must have done 25 crunches less than the number of push-ups he did (58 - 33 = 25). So, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches is 25."

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain. If 60 families of birds fly away for winter, then the number of families remaining behind is 19 - 60 = -41. Therefore, there are 41 fewer families of birds flying away for winter than those who live behind the mountain."
"Response: 109
Explanation:
If there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 7 families fly away for winter, then there are 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds left behind. Therefore, there are 109 families of birds living in the area (80 families left behind + 27 families that flew away)."
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 20 families of birds that fly away for winter while 14 families stay behind in the mountains. Therefore, the number of families of birds that stay near the mountain is 8 (20 - 14)."
Response:  There are 26 keluarga burung that remain near the mountain.
"Response: 53
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 8 families of birds living near a mountain. If 42 families fly to Africa and 31 families fly to Asia, then the number of families flying to Africa is 42, and the number of families flying to Asia is 31. Therefore, the difference between the number of families flying to Africa and the number of families flying to Asia is 42 - 31 = 9. So, 9 families flew to Africa from the original 8 families living near the mountain."
"Response: 102
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 38 families of birds living near a mountain. If 47 families of birds fly to Africa and 94 families of birds fly to Asia, then the total number of families of birds flying to Asia is 94 - 47 = 47 families. Therefore, the number of families of birds flying to Asia is 102 (38 + 47)."
Response:  There are 122 families of birds that migrate to warmer countries during winter (38 x 3 = 122).
"Response: 59
Explanation:
The passage states that there are currently 87 families of birds living near the mountain. If 18 more families join them, then the total number of families would be 87 + 18 = 105 families of birds living near the mountain."
"Response: 73

Explanation:
The total number of families of birds that live near the mountain is given by the equation:
Total = Number of families that stay + Number of families that fly in for winter
= 49 + 59
= 108

Since 24 new families of birds arrived from the Arctic, the total number of families of birds living near the mountain now is:
Total = 108 + 24
= 132

Therefore, there are 73 families of birds living near the mountain."
Response:  There are 68 families of birds that live near the mountain initially.
"Response: 139
Explanation:
The total number of families of birds that fly away for winter is given as 86. Since there are 45 families of birds that live near the mountain initially, and they all fly away for winter, the total number of families of birds that fly away for winter is 86 + 45 = 131. Therefore, the answer is 131."
"Response: 79
Explanation:
If 35 families of birds flew to Asia and 62 families flew to Africa, then there are 79 families that flew to Africa more than those who flew to Asia."
"Response: 54
Explanation:
According to the passage, there are currently 3 families of birds living near the mountain. When winter arrives and many animals migrate to warmer areas, 26 new families of birds come to live near the mountain from the Arctic while 2 families fly far south for the winter. Therefore, there are a total of 54 families of birds living near the mountain (3 + 26 = 54)."

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Paul received 551 pensils and only kept 177 of them. Therefore, the number of pensils he has left is 551 - 177 = 374. Since he only needs 100 pensils for his birthday, the number of pensils he will have left after giving some to his friends is 374 - 100 = 274."
"Response: 28

Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 90 pensils and lost 412 pensils. So, the difference between the number of pensils he gave away and the number he lost is 90 - 412 = -322. Therefore, the number of additional pensils that Paul lost is 322."
"Response: 109
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 563 pensils during his school year while he lost 558 pensils. Therefore, if he only has 332 colored pensils left, then he must have had at least 109 pensils for his birthday (the number of pensils he gave away minus the number of pensils he lost)."
Response:  There are 108 pensils that have been given away or lost.
"Response: 307
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 521 pensils and used 66 of them. This means that he has 455 pensils left (521 - 66 = 455). Since he did not lose any pensils, the number of pensils he has at the end of the year is 455. Therefore, the answer is 307."

Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 2 books initially and sold some of them at his garage sale. After selling some, he bought 150 new books, leaving him with 58 books now. Therefore, he has sold 92 books (2 - 58 = 92)."
"Response: 39
Explanation:
If Paul has 21 books and sells some of them, then he will have fewer books left. Let's assume that he sold x books. Since he bought 42 new books after selling some, the total number of books he now has is 21 + 42 = 63. Therefore, the number of books he sold is equal to the number of books he bought, which is 42 - x. So, x = 39."
"Response: 45
Explanation:
If Paul has 71 books and sells some of them, he will have fewer books left. Let's say he sold x books. Then, he has (71 - x) books left. If he then buys 38 new books, he will have (71 - x + 38) books in total. Since he already had x books, the number of books he bought is equal to the number of books he sold. Therefore, the ratio of the number of books he bought to the number of books he sold is 38:x."

Response: 36
Response: 21
Response:  For every 4 biskut masin that Paco eats, he eats 1 less biskit manis. So if he eats 5 biskot manis and 2 biskot masin, he will eat 3 more biskot manis than biskot masin. Therefore, the number of biskot manis that Paco eats is 3 x 5 = 15, and the number of biskot masin that he eats is 2.  Thus, the ratio of the number of biskot manis to the number of biskot masin that Paco eats is 15 : 2 or 7.5 : 1.
Response:  For every 1 biskut manis that Paco eats, he eats 1.5 times as many biskut masin. Therefore, if Paco eats 8 biskut manis, he will eat 12 (8 x 1.5) biskut masin. If he eats 6 biskut masin, he will eat 9 (6 x 1.5) biskut manis. So the number of biskut masin that Paco eats is 9 more than the number of biskut manis that he eats.

Response:  For every 4 biskut manis that Paco eats, he eats 3 biskut masin. Therefore, if Paco eats 40 biskut manis and 25 biskut masin, he will eat 4 x 3 = 12 biskut masin more than he eats biskut manis. So the number of biskut masin that Paco eats is 25 + 12 = 37 biskut masin.

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Tukang roti (baker) made 54 pieces of roti.
* He sold some of them.
* Now he has 13 pieces of roti left.

To find out how many pieces of roti were sold by the baker, we can use the following equation:

Sold roti = Total roti - Remaining roti

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Sold roti = 54 - 13 = 41

Therefore, the baker sold 41 pieces of roti."
"Response: 330

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Tukang roti (baker) has sold 145 of his total 217 rotis.
* The remaining number of rotis he has is 72.

To find out how many rotis the baker made initially, we can use the following equation:

Number of rotis made = Remaining number of rotis / Number sold

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of rotis made = 72 / 145 = 330

Therefore, the baker made 330 rotis initially."

"Response: 26
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Pembakar made 14 cakes and 153 pastries. If he sold 8 cakes and 97 cakes, then the number of cakes he sold is 8/14 = 0.57 (approximately).
Now, let's find out how many more cakes Pembakar sold than Baker:
Number of cakes sold by Pembakar - Number of cakes sold by Baker = 0.57 - x
where x is the number of cakes sold by Baker.
We know that Baker sold 8 kek, so the number of cakes sold by Baker is 8/14 = 0.57 (approximately) as well.
Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes sold by Pembakar and Baker is:
0.57 - 0.57 = 0
So, Pembakar sold exactly the same number of cakes as Baker."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the passage, Tukang Roti made 43 keks and 114 pastries. If he sold 154 keks and 78 keks, then the number of keks that are more than those sold by Baker is 26 (154 - 78 = 76)."

Response: 8 people can sit in each seat. Therefore, 8 x 4 = 32 people can sit in total at the four seats of the Ferris wheel in Taman Paradise.
"Response: 36
Explanation:
The number of seats available on each bench in Taman Paradise is 9. Since there are 18 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, and each bench can accommodate 9 people, then the total number of benches needed to accommodate all 18 people is:
9 (number of seats per bench) x 18 (total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel) = 162
Since each bench has 9 seats, then the total number of benches needed is:
162 / 9 = 36
Therefore, there are 36 benches in total that can accommodate all 18 people who want to ride the Ferris wheel in Taman Paradise."
Response: 450 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at the same time. Explanation: Each Ferris wheel in Taman Paradise has 19 seats, and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on one Ferris wheel is 19 x 15 = 285 people. Since there are 20 Ferris wheels in total, the maximum number of people who can ride on them simultaneously is 20 x 285 = 5,700 people.
"Response: 720
Explanation:
To determine how many people can fit in the Ferris wheel at once, we need to multiply the number of seats by the capacity per seat. In this case, there are 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people, so the total capacity is:
18 x 15 = 270
If 10 broken chairs (which means 10 less seats) are available for use during the same time period, then the reduced capacity would be:
270 - 10 = 260
Therefore, 260 people can fit in the Ferris wheel at any given time."
"Response: 20
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, there are 6 places for sitting on the Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise, and each place can accommodate 14 people. Therefore, if there are currently 16 people on the Ferris wheel, there is room for an additional 20 people to join (6 x 14 = 84, so 84 - 16 = 20)."
Response:  The number of people who can fit in the small seats is 14 per seat, so the total number of people who can fit in the small seats is 14 x 2 = 28.
"Response: 48
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 7 places for big chairs and each can accommodate 12 people, so the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the large seats is 7 x 12 = 84 people. Additionally, there are 3 small seats that can accommodate 16 people each, so the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 84 + 3 x 16 = 48 people. Therefore, the answer is 48 people."

* Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds.
* They put 15 seeds in each pot.
* Only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each pot.

So, if they planted 55 seeds and only 60 grew, that means there were 95 remaining seeds (55 - 60 = 95).

Now, let's calculate how many flowers grew:
95 seeds x 60% growth rate = 57 flowers

Therefore, there are 57 flowers growing in total."
Response: 3
"Response: 40

Response: 4
Response: 2.5 (keropok)
"Response: 5
Explanation: If Matthew has 24 keropok and gives an equal number to each of his 3 friends, then he will have 24 / 3 = 8 keropok left over after giving them out."
Response:  For each of the 11 friends, Matthew gave out an equal amount of both keropok and kek. So if Matthew gave out 22 keropok and 34 kek in total, then he gave out 22/11 = 2 keropok and 34/11 = 3 kek to each friend.
Response: 15
Response:  For each of the 7 friends, Matthew gave an equal amount of crackers and cookies. Therefore, if Matthew gave 14 crackers and 21 cookies to himself, he gave 14/7 = 2 crackers and 21/7 = 3 cookies to each of his 7 friends. So, in total, Matthew's 7 friends ate 2 x 7 = 14 crackers and 3 x 7 = 21 cookies.
Response: 36/18 = 2
Response: 36 x 6 = 216
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew has 23 keropok and he gives an equal amount to 2 friends. Therefore, each friend will get 11 keropok. So, the number of keropok that each friend will eat is 5 (11 / 2 = 5)."

If he had 32 keropok and 98 kek initially, then each friend would have received 32/4 = 8 keropok and 98/4 = 24 kek. Therefore, there are 16 keropok and 24 kek left after everyone has eaten their share."
"Response: 32
Explanation:
Matthew has 10 kek to share among 4 friends, so each friend will get 2.5 kek (10 / 4 = 2.5). Since there are also 8 kek that Matthew had initially, each friend will get a total of 3.5 kek (2.5 + 8 = 3.5). Therefore, 32 kek will be consumed in total."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
Matthew has 13 keropok and 15 kek to share among his 28 friends. Since each friend will get an equal amount of both keropok and kek, the total number of keropok and kek that each friend will receive is 13/28 = 0.467 (or rounding it up to 46). Therefore, the total number of keropok and kek that all 28 friends will eat together is 46 x 2 = 92."

From the question, we know that Faye has 36 pensils in each of the 7 rows. Therefore, the total number of pensils she has is:
36 x 7 = 252
Since there are 30 krayons in each row, the total number of krayons Faye has is:
30 x 7 = 210
So, the total number of pensils and krayons Faye has is:
252 + 210 = 462
Therefore, the answer to the question is 48."

"Response: 234
Explanation:
If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day and 666 visitors on the current day, then the increase in number of visitors is 234 (666 - 100)."
Response: 589 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday. Explanation: According to the passage, 132 people visited the palace today and there were 406 visitors in total over 327 days ago. Therefore, the number of visitors yesterday was 589 (132 + 406).
Response: 1067 people visited the Buckingham Palace on that day. Explanation: According to the passage, 45 people visited the palace the day before, and if 829 people visited in total over an 85-day period, then the average number of visitors per day is: (829 / 85) = 1067 people.
"Response: 3064
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on each day is represented by X. Since there were 71 paintings in the palace, and Rachel knew that 557 people visited the palace on that particular day, we can write an equation as follows:
X + 557 = 71 (Since 557 is the total number of visitors on that day)
Now, let's find out how many visitors went to the palace during the previous 57 days:
If X represents the number of visitors on Day n, then we have:
X + (n-1) × 188 = 71 (Since there are 71 paintings in the palace, and 188 visitors came on each of the previous 57 days)
Substituting X with the value obtained from the first equation:
557 = X + (n-1) × 188
Solving for X:
X = 3064 (Rounded to the nearest integer)
Therefore, the answer is 3064."
"Response: 425
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to the palace on the previous day was x. Since Rachel knew 661 people came to the palace on the current day, we can write an equation:
x + 661 = 39 (total number of paintings in the palace)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 39 - 661
x = -622
So, there were 622 fewer visitors to the palace on the current day compared to the previous day."
Response:  There were 524 visitors to Buckingham Palace before the day of the event (Rachel's group included).
Response: 365 people visited the Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days. Explanation: According to the information provided, there were 512 visitors on the day of the examination, and 471 visitors the day before that. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days is: 512 + 471 = 365.
"Response: 368

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* On the day of their visit to Buckingham Palace, Selepas and Rachel saw 705 visitors.
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace was 191 on the previous day (day -1) and 457 on the day before that (-2 days ago).

Now, let's find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day of Selepas and Rachel's visit compared to the previous day:

More visitors = New visitors - Old visitors
= 705 - 191
= 514

So, there were 514 more visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day of Selepas and Rachel's visit compared to the previous day."

Response: 12 tong anggur/day
Response: 30 tong anggur will be filled each day.
"Response: 3085

Explanation:
To find out how many tongs of anggur will be filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the number of tongs filled each day by the number of days.

According to the question, 294 pemungut fill 244 tongs of anggur each day, so the total number of tongs filled in one day is 244.

Now, let's calculate the total number of tongs filled in 146 days:

146 days × 244 tongs/day = 3085 tongs

Therefore, there will be 3085 tongs of anggur filled in 146 days."
Response: 468 tongs of grapes will be filled during 77 days.
Response: 3640
"Response: 15 days
Explanation:
If it takes 36 workers 8 tongs of grapes per day to fill one container, and there are 240 tongs in total, then we can calculate the number of days required to fill all the containers as follows:

Number of days = Total number of tongs / Number of tongs filled per day
= 240 tongs / 8 tongs per day
= 30 days

However, since the last container is being filled at the end, we need to add an extra day for that (since the workers will not be able to work on the last day). Therefore, the final answer is 15 days."

"Response: 16

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Adam and Jackie have 7 epal together, and they are not alone in their house. Therefore, there must be at least 9 people (including Adam and Jackie) who have epal in the house. So, the total number of epal in the house is 9 + 7 = 16."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
From the given information, we can deduce that:
Adam has 12 epal and Jackie has 9 epal.
So, together they have 12 + 9 = 21 epal.
Adam has 8 more epal than Jackie, so Adam has 21 - 8 = 13 epal.
Therefore, there are 36 epal in total (12 from Adam and 13 from Jackie)."
