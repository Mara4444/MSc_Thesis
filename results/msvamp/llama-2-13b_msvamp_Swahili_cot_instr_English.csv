Response:  We know that Julia has 18 days to spend with her children during the weekend (Jumatatu). She spends 10 days with them during the week (Jumanne). To find out which day she spends more time with her children, we need to compare the number of days she spends with them during each period.   Day spent with children during Jumatatu = 18 Days spent with children during Jumanne = 10 Now, let's divide the total number of days spent with children during Jumatatu by the number of days spent with children during Jumanne:  18 / 10 = 1.8 This means that Julia spends approximately 1.8 times more days with her children during Jumatatu than she does during Jumanne. Therefore, the correct answer is option B - Jumatatu.
Response:  We know that Julia has 11 children on Saturday and 12 children on Sunday. To find out how many more children she has on Sunday than on Saturday, we need to subtract the number of children she has on Saturday from the number of children she has on Sunday.  12 - 11 =?  12 - 11 = 1 Therefore, Julia has one more child on Sunday than on Saturday.
Response:  If Julia has to take care of her children for 5 days (Jumatatu) and each day she spends 3 hours with each child, then she will spend a total of  3 x 5 = 15 hours taking care of all five children.  Now, if she has to spend an additional 2 hours with each child on Jumanne (Sunday), then she will spend a total of  2 x 5 = 10 hours on Sunday.  Therefore, the total number of hours Julia will spend taking care of her children during the week is  15 + 10 = 25 hours.
Response:  If Alicheza has 14 children and each child takes 2 days to complete their homework, then she will have 28 days of homework in total (14 x 2 = 28). However, if she has 16 children, she will have 32 days of homework (16 x 2 = 32). So, if Alicheza has 16 children, she will have 32 days of homework on Saturdays.
Response:  If Julia has 16 days to spend with her children during the weekend (Friday and Saturday), and she spends 12 more days with them than she does with her husband, how many days does she spend with her husband?   To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's say that Julia spends x days with her husband and y days with her children. We know that x + y = 16 (total number of days) and x > y (Julia spends more days with her children). Can you use these two equations to find out how many days Julia spends with her husband?
Response:  If Julia has 14 children and she wants to divide them equally into two groups of 8 or more each, then we can start by dividing 14 by 2.  14 / 2 = 7 So, Julia will have 7 children in one group and 7 children in the other group. However, since Julia wants the groups to be equal, we need to make sure that both groups have at least 8 children. To do this, we can add 1 to each group to ensure that they both have at least 8 children. Therefore, Julia will have 8 children in one group and 9 children in the other group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has three children aged 17 years old (Jumatatu), 15 years old (Jumanne) and 2 years old (Jumatano). Next, we need to calculate the total number of years for all her children.  17 + 15 + 2 = 34 years. Therefore, the sum of the ages of Julia's children is 34 years.
Response:  We know that Julia has 15 children aged between 6 and 12 years old (Jumatatu) and 18 children aged between 13 and 18 years old (Jumanne). To find out how many children she has in total, we need to add the number of children in each age group.   Total number of children = Number of children aged 6-12 + Number of children aged 13-18  Total number of children = 15 + 18 = 33  Therefore, Julia has 33 children in total.
Response:  We know that Julia has 5 children and each child will spend 3 days with her during the weekend (Jumatatu). So, in total, how many days will all the children spend with Julia during the weekend?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of children by the number of days they will spend with Julia. In this case, we can do:  5 x 3 = 15 days  Therefore, all the children will spend 15 days with Julia during the weekend (Jumatatu).
"Response:  We know that Julia has 3 children and each child spends a different number of days with her during the week.  
Child 1 (Watoto 1) spends 2 days with Julia (Jumatatu). Child 2 (Watoto 2) spends 14 days with Julia (Jumanne). And Child 3 (Watoto 3) spends 16 days with Julia (Jumatano).  To find out how many days in total Julia spends with all three children, we need to add up the number of days for each child:  
Total = 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 days.  So, Julia spends 32 days with all three children."
Response:  We know that Julia has 9 children for 3 days (Jumatatu), 7 children for 2 days (Jumanne), and 96 children for 1 day (Jumatano). To find out how many more days she spends with her children in Jumatatu compared to Jumanne, we need to calculate the total number of days she spends with all her children. Total number of days = Number of children x Number of days per child So, Total number of days = 9 x 3 + 7 x 2 + 96 x 1 = 27 + 14 + 96 = 137 days Now, let's compare the number of days she spends with her children in Jumatatu (3 days) to the number of days she spends with her children in Jumanne (2 days): Difference = 3 - 2 = 1 day Therefore, Julia spends one more day with her children in Jumatatu than in Jumanne.
Response:  We know that Julia has 14 children for three days (Jumatatu), 2 children for two days (Jumanne), and 8 children for one day (Jumatano). To find out which child spends more time with Julia during Jumatatu than Jumatano, we need to calculate the total number of days each child spends with Julia.  14 children x 3 days = 42 days 2 children x 2 days = 4 days 8 children x 1 day = 8 days Now, let's compare the total number of days each child spends with Julia: 42 > 4 > 8 So, the child who spends more time with Julia during Jumatatu than Jumatano is the first child.
"Response:  We know that Julia has 3 children and each child spends a different number of days with her during the week.  ü§î So, let's start by listing out the information we have:  - Watoto 1 (Wednesday) spends 8 days with Julia.  - Watoto 2 (Thursday) spends 11 days with Julia.  - Watoto 3 (Friday) spends 9 days with Julia. Now, we need to find out which child spends more time with Julia than the others. To do this, we can compare the number of days each child spends with Julia. üìù Here are the comparisons:  ‚Ä¢ Watoto 1 (Wednesday) spends 8 days with Julia, while Watoto 2 (Thursday) spends 11 days with Julia. This means that Watoto 2 spends 3 more days with Julia than Watoto 1 does!  ‚Ä¢ Watoto 2 (Thursday) spends 11 days with Julia, while Watoto 3 (Friday) spends 9 days with Julia. This means that Watoto 2 spends 2 more days with Julia than Watoto 3 does!  ‚Ä¢ Watoto 3 (Friday) spends 9 days with Julia, while Watoto 1 (Wednesday) spends 8 days with Julia. This means that there is no difference in the number of days between these two children.  Based on our comparisons, we can see that Watoto 2 (Thursday) spends the most time with Julia among all three children! üòä So, the answer to the question ""Which child spends more time with Julia?"" is Watoto 2 (Thursday)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has three children aged 15 years old (Jumatatu), 18 years old (Jumanne) and 7 years old (Jumatano). Secondly, we are asked to find out which child spends more time with their mother during the weekdays. To do this, we need to calculate the number of days each child spends with their mother.   For Jumatatu (15 years old): There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday), so Jumatatu spends 5 days with her mother every week. For Jumanne (18 years old): There are also 5 weekdays in a week, so Jumanne spends 5 days with his mother every week. For Jumatano (7 years old): Since there are only 3 weekdays in a week (Monday to Wednesday), Jumatano spends only 3 days with his mother every week. Now, let's compare the total number of days each child spends with their mother per week: Jumatatu - 5 days Jumanne - 5 days Jumatano - 3 days Based on the above calculations, it is clear that Jumatatu and Jumanne spend the same amount of time with their mother (5 days per week), while Jumatano spends less time with her (3 days per week). Therefore, the correct answer is: Jumatatu and Jumanne.
Response:  We know that Julia has 13 children aged between 6 and 10 years old (Jumatatu) and 15 children aged between 11 and 15 years old (Jumatano). To find out how many children she has in total, we need to add the number of children in each age group.   Total number of children = Number of children aged 6-10 + Number of children aged 11-15  Total number of children = 13 + 15 = 28  Therefore, Julia has 28 children.
Response:  We know that Julia has 7 days to spend with her children during the weekend (Jumatatu) and 13 days to spend with them during the school holidays (Jumanne). So, in total, she spends 7 + 13 = 20 days with her children.   Now, we need to find out how many days she spends with her children each year. To do this, we divide the number of days she spends with her children by the number of years she has to spend with them. In this case, she spends 20 days with her children per year.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Julia has 12 children and each child needs to be given a gift for 14 days, so the total number of gifts she needs to buy is  12 x 14 = 168 gifts. 
Secondly, we are told that Julia wants to spend Sh. 34 per day on gifts, so the total amount she will spend on all the gifts is  168 x 34 = 5,572 shillings. 
Therefore, the names of the 12 children who will receive gifts from Julia are not specified in the problem statement."
Response:  We know that Julia has 19 children and she wants to divide them equally among two days, Jumatatu and Jumanne. So, if we divide 19 by 2, we get:  19 √∑ 2 = 9 + 10 (remainder) Therefore, Julia will have 9 children on Jumatatu and 10 children on Jumanne. Now, let's find out which day has more children. To do this, we can compare the number of children on each day:  9 < 10 (9 is less than 10) So, Jumanne has one more child than Jumatatu. In other words, Jumanne has 10 children, while Jumatatu has 9 children.
Response:  We know that Julia has 5 children for one day (Jumanne) and 6 children for another day (Jumatatu). To find out which child she has more of, we need to compare the number of children she has for each day.  5 > 6 So, Julia has more children on Jumanne than on Jumatatu.
Response:  We know that Julia has 18 children and she takes care of them for 4 days (Thursday to Sunday). So, on Thursday, she takes care of 4 children, on Friday - 5 children, on Saturday - 6 children, and on Sunday - 7 children. In total, Julia takes care of 28 children during the week.
Response:  We know that Julia has 4 children and each child spends 6 days with her during the week (Monday to Saturday). So, in total, Julia will spend  6 x 4 = 24 days with her children. However, we are also given that she spends 17 days with her children during the month of Jumanne. Therefore, the difference between the number of days Julia spends with her children during Jumanne and the number of days she spends with them during the week is:  17 - 24 = 7 days.  So, Julia spends more time with her children during Jumanne than she does during the week.
Response: 1. The total number of students in class A is 43. 2. If Bobby has 25 more than Ali, then Ali has  25 - 1 = 24 students. 3. Therefore, the difference between the number of students in Class A and Class B is:  43 - 24 = 19.
Response: 1. Bobby has 28 more than Piia. So, if Pia has x, then Bobby has x + 28.  2. Kisha has 42 more than Bobby. Therefore, if Bobby has x + 28, then Kisha has (x + 28) + 42 = x + 28 + 42.  3. We know that Pia has 63 fewer than Kisha. So, if Kisha has x + 28 + 42, then Pia has x + 28 + 42 - 63 = x + 28 + 42 - 63. Simplifying, we get: Pia has 59 fewer than Bobby. Therefore, Bobby has 59 more than Pia. Solution: Bobby has 59 more than Pia.
Response:  First, we know that Bobby has 33 cents and he spends 4 more cents on pipi. So, his new amount is:  33 + 4 = 37 cents. Now, we are told that Pia gives him 14 cents for her chokoleti. So, Bobby now has:  37 - 14 = 23 cents. Therefore, the total amount of money Bobby has after both transactions is 23 cents.
Response:  First, we know that Bobby has 38 more than Piia in terms of pipis. So if Pia has x pipis, Bobby has x + 38 pipis.   Next, we know that Pia has 16 fewer chokolates than Bobby. Therefore, if Bobby has y chokolates, Pia has y - 16 chokolates.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 38) = y - 16  Simplifying the equation:  2x + 38 = y  Solving for x:  2x = y - 38  x = (y - 38) / 2  Since we are looking for the number of pipis that Pia has, we need to substitute y with the value given in the problem:  y = 36  Substituting y into the previous equation:  2(36 - 38) / 2 = 36 - 38  Solving for x:  72 / 2 = 36  x = 36  Therefore, Pia has 36 pipis.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby had 20 pencils and he gave 34 to his friend. So, how many pencils does Bobby have left? To find out, subtract the number of pencils given away from the total number of pencils:  20 - 34 =  Bobby has 16 pencils left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has 21 pencils in total and he gave away 5 of them. So, the number of pencils left with him is:  21 - 5 = 16 Now, we are asked to find out how many more pencils does Bobby need to buy if he wants to have 9 more than what he has now. To do this, we subtract 16 (the current number of pencils) from 9:  9 - 16 = -7 Therefore, Bobby needs to buy 7 more pencils to have 9 more than what he currently has.
Response: 1. The total number of boys is 22. 2. If there were 5 more boys, the new total would be 22 + 5 = 27. 3. So, to find out how many girls are needed to make up 8 groups of 4 each, we can divide 27 by 4: 27 / 4 = 6 with 1 girl left over. Therefore, 6 girls are needed to make up 8 groups of 4 each.
Response:  If Bobby had 19 pencils and gave 2 to his friend, how many pencils does he have left?   We can use subtraction to find out.  19 - 2 =?   Can you solve this problem and tell me the answer?
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pencils and he gives 20 to his friend, then he will have  32 - 20 = 12 pencils left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has 17 marbles and Kisha has 15 marbles.  Secondly, if they combined their marbles, they would have  36 marbles in total (17 + 15 = 36).  Finally, since each marble is worth 2 points, the total number of points for both players is:  36 x 2 = 72 points.
Response:  If Bobby had $23 and spent $30 on a toy, then he has $23 - $30 = $-7 left.   So, Bobby does not have any money left after buying the toy.
Response:  We know that Allan has 5 marbles and Jake has 3 marbles. To find out how many more marbles Allan has than Jake, we need to subtract the number of marbles Jake has from the number of marbles Allan has.  5 - 3 =?  The difference is 2. So, Allan has 2 more marbles than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Allan has two balls and Jake has three balls. To find out how many more balls Jake has than Allan, we need to subtract the number of balls Allan has from the number of balls Jake has.  
So, if Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 3 balls, then:  
Jake has 3 - 2 = 1 more ball than Allan."
Response:  If Allan took 3 balls and gave 2 to Jake, then Allan has  1 ball left.  So, Jake got 2 balls from Allan.
Response:  If Jake has 6 balls and he gives 4 to Allan, then Jake will have  6 - 4 = 2 balls left.
Response:  If Allan took 5 balls and gave 1 to Jake, then Allan has  4 balls left (5 - 1 = 4).  Now, if Jake took 6 more balls from Allan, Jake would have a total of  6 + 4 = 10 balls.
Response:  We know that Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls.  If Allan wants to have as many balls as Jake, he needs to get  5 - 3 = 2 more balls. So, Allan will need 2 more balls than Jake. Therefore, the total number of balls that Allan and Jake together will have is:  3 + 5 = 8 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has two balls and Jake has four balls. Secondly, Allan wants to have three more balls than Jake in total. Now let's calculate how many balls Jake has altogether. We can do this by adding up his individual ball counts:  4 + 4 = 8. So Jake has eight balls in total. Next, we need to find out how many balls Allan needs to catch up with Jake. To do this, we subtract Jake's total from Allan's current count of two balls:  2 - 8 = -6. This means Allan is six balls short of Jake's total. Therefore, Allan needs to obtain six additional balls to have as many balls as Jake.
Response:  We know that Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 6 balls.  If Allan wants to have as many balls as Jake, he needs to get  6 - 2 = 4 more balls. So, Allan needs 4 more balls than Jake.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 5 marbles and Jake has 4 marbles. Secondly, Allan wants to give 3 more marbles to Jake so that Jake will have as many marbles as Allan. Now, let's calculate how many marbles Allan will be left with after giving 3 marbles to Jake.  
If Jake has 4 + 3 = 7 marbles, then Allan will be left with 5 - 3 = 2 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 2."
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 2 balls more than Allan. So, Jake has 6 + 2 = 8 balls. Now we need to find out how many more balls Allan has compared to Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of balls Jake has from the number of balls Allan has:  8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, Allan has 2 more balls than Jake.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 6 marbles and Jake has 3 marbles. Secondly, Jake gained 4 more marbles than Allan in the game. Therefore, if Allan had x marbles before the game, then Jake gained 4 + x = 4x marbles during the game. Now, let's add up all the marbles owned by both players after the game:  
Allan had 6 marbles initially, so he still has 6 marbles now.  Jake had 3 marbles initially, plus he gained 4x marbles during the game, which gives him a total of 3 + 4x = 7x marbles now. So, Jake has more marbles (7x) than Allan (6)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 5 marbles and Jake has 6 marbles. Secondly, we are told that Jake gave 3 more marbles to Allan. Therefore, Jake now has 6 - 3 = 3 marbles left. Finally, we need to find out how many marbles Allan has after receiving 3 marbles from Jake. To do this, we add 3 to Allan's initial number of marbles, which is 5. So, Allan now has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
Response:  We know that Allan and Jake have been in prison for 3 years and 5 years respectively. If we add their imprisonment periods, we get:  3 + 5 = 8 years. Therefore, both Allan and Jake were imprisoned together for 8 years in the same prison.
"Response:  We know that Allan and Jake have balls of different sizes.  If Allan has a ball with a diameter of 7 cm and Jake has a ball with a diameter of 6 cm, we can start by finding their volumes using the formula for the volume of a sphere (V = (4/3)œÄr^3), where r is the radius of the sphere.  
For Allan's ball, the radius is half of the diameter, so r = 7/2 = 3.5 cm. Now we can find the volume of Allan's ball: V = (4/3)œÄ(3.5)^3 = approximately 30.8 cubic centimeters (cm^3).  
For Jake's ball, the radius is also half of the diameter, so r = 6/2 = 3 cm. Now we can find the volume of Jake's ball: V = (4/3)œÄ(3)^3 = approximately 19.6 cm^3.  
Now that we have found the volumes of both balls, we can compare them to determine which one is larger. Based on our calculations, Allan's ball has a greater volume than Jake's ball. So, if they were in the same location (bustani), Allan's ball would be visible above Jake's ball."
Response:  If Allan has 5 marbles and gives 2 to Jake, then Allan will have  5 - 2 = 3 marbles left.  So, Jake will have  2 marbles.
"Response:  If Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 6 balls, then Jake has more balls than Allan.  
So, if they both have to throw their balls into the same basket, Jake would need to throw his 6 balls first, followed by Allan throwing his 2 balls. Therefore, Jake would have thrown 8 balls (his 6 + Allan's 2) before Allan threw his 2 balls."
Response:  We know that Kila has been studying for 6 months and can speak Kiingereza fluently. This means she has mastered all the basics of the language and can communicate effectively in everyday situations. Now, let's compare her proficiency in Kiingereza to her proficiency in Kichina. Since she has only studied Kichina for 2 months, it is likely that her proficiency in this language is not as high as her proficiency in Kiingereza. Therefore, we can say that Kila's proficiency in Kiingereza is higher than her proficiency in Kichina. Numeric answer:  3 (Kiingereza) > 2 (Kichina).
"Response:  To determine which language is more difficult to learn for a non-native speaker, we need to consider several factors such as grammar complexity, vocabulary size, pronunciation difficulty, and cultural differences. Here are some points to compare Kiingereza and Kichina:  1. Grammar Complexity: Swahili (Kiingereza) has a relatively simple grammar system with no verb conjugation, gendered nouns, or plural forms. On the other hand, Kichina has a complex grammar system with many irregularities in verb conjugation, noun gender, and plural forms. Therefore, it can be concluded that Kiingereza has a simpler grammar than Kichina.  2. Vocabulary Size: Both languages have similar vocabularies, but Kichina has borrowed many words from other languages like Arabic and English, making its vocabulary larger than Kiingereza. However, this does not necessarily mean that Kichina is harder to learn because of the sheer number of words.  3. Pronunciation Difficulty: Kiingereza has a relatively easy pronunciation system compared to Kichina, which has a complex set of consonant and vowel sounds that can be challenging for non-native speakers. For example, Kichina has a unique sound called ""clicking"" that doesn't exist in Kiingereza. Therefore, it can be argued that Kiingereza is easier to pronounce than Kichina.  4. Cultural Differences: Both languages are spoken in different regions with distinct cultures. Kiingereza is primarily spoken in East Africa, while Kichina is spoken mainly in Southern Africa. This means that learners of Kiingereza may find it easier to adapt to the culture associated with the language, whereas learners of Kichina may face additional challenges related to cultural differences. In conclusion, based on these factors, it seems that Kiingereza might be slightly easier to learn for a non-native speaker compared to Kichina. However, both languages present unique challenges, and the difficulty of learning either one will ultimately depend on the individual learner's background, motivation, and learning style."
Response:  If we have to learn 3 words in Kiingereza and Kichina every day for 4 days, then we will learn:   Day 1: 3 x 1 = 3 words (Kiingereza) + 3 x 1 = 3 words (Kichina) = 6 words Total Day 2: 3 x 2 = 6 words (Kiingereza) + 3 x 2 = 6 words (Kichina) = 12 words Total Day 3: 3 x 3 = 9 words (Kiingereza) + 3 x 3 = 9 words (Kichina) = 18 words Total Day 4: 3 x 4 = 12 words (Kiingereza) + 3 x 4 = 12 words (Kichina) = 24 words In total, we will learn 6 + 12 + 18 + 24 = 50 words over 4 days.
Response:  If we have to learn 7 topics in Kiingereza and 2 more in Kichina, then we will learn 9 topics in total.   Therefore, if we spend x hours learning Kiingereza, we will spend (9-2) = 7 hours learning Kichina.
Response:  If we have to learn two new languages, one is Swahili (Kiingereza) and the other is Chinese (Kichina), how many months will it take us to learn each language if we spend five hours per week studying each language?   Firstly, let's calculate the total number of weeks we need to study each language. We can do this by dividing the number of months we want to spend learning each language by the number of weeks in a month. There are four weeks in a month, so:   For Kiingereza (Swahili): Number of months = 2 months Number of weeks = 2 x 4 = 8 weeks To learn Kiingereza in eight weeks, we need to spend five hours per week studying it, for a total of: Total hours spent learning Kiingereza = 8 weeks x 5 hours/week = 40 hours  Similarly, for Kichina (Chinese): Number of months = 2 months Number of weeks = 2 x 4 = 8 weeks To learn Kichina in eight weeks, we need to spend five hours per week studying it, for a total of: Total hours spent learning Kichina = 8 weeks x 5 hours/week = 40 hours Therefore, it would take us the same amount of time (40 hours) to learn both Kiingereza and Kichina if we spend five hours per week studying each language.
Response:  We know that Kila siku Ryan anatumia masaa 6 kujifunza Kiingereza na masaa 7 kujifunza Kichina. This means that for every 6 minutes he spends learning Kiingereza, he spends 7 minutes learning Kichina.   Now, if he learns both subjects for 5 minutes, we can calculate how much time he spends on each subject as follows:   Time spent learning Kiingereza = (5/6) x 7 = 10 minutes   Time spent learning Kichina = (5/7) x 6 = 8 minutes   Therefore, if Kila spends 5 minutes learning both subjects, he will spend 10 minutes learning Kiingereza and 8 minutes learning Kichina.
Response:  We know that Kila siku Ryan anatumia masaa 6 kujifunza Kiingereza na masaa 5 kujifunza Kichina. This means that for every 6 minutes he spends learning Swahili, he can speak 5 words in Kichina. Now, we want to find out how many minutes he needs to spend speaking Kiingereza to learn 10 words. To do this, we need to divide the number of words he can speak in Kiingereza by the number of words he can speak in Kichina. So, let's divide 10 (the number of words he wants to learn in Kiingereza) by 5 (the number of words he can speak in Kichina per minute).  10 √∑ 5 =?  The result is 2. Therefore, Kila siku Ryan needs to spend 2 minutes speaking Kiingereza to learn 10 words.
Response:  We know that Kila siku Ryan anatumia masaa 5 kujifunza Kiingereza na masaa 4 kujifunza Kichina. This means that for every 5 minutes he spends learning Swahili (Kiingereza), he can learn 4 minutes of another subject (Kichina).   Now, if he learns for 6 minutes, we need to find out how much time he spends on each subject.   Since he learns for 6 minutes in total, and he spends 5 minutes learning Swahili, he spends the remaining 1 minute learning the other subject (Kichina).  So, the breakdown is:  üìö Swahili (Kiingereza): 5 minutes üìö Other Subject (Kichina): 1 minute
Response:  We know that Kila siku Ryan anatumia masaa 4 kujifunza Kiingereza na masaa 6 kujifunza Kichina. This means that for every 4 seconds he spends learning Kiingereza, he spends 6 seconds learning Kichina.   Now, we are asked to find out how long it would take him to learn both languages if he learns each language at the same rate as before. To do this, we need to find out how many seconds he would spend learning each language in total.   First, let's calculate how many seconds he would spend learning Kiingereza:  4 seconds x (1 + 6/4) = 4 seconds x 1.5 = 6 seconds   Next, let's calculate how many seconds he would spend learning Kichina:  6 seconds x (1 + 4/6) = 6 seconds x 1.2 = 7.2 seconds   Finally, let's add up the total number of seconds he would spend learning both languages:  6 + 7.2 = 13.2 seconds   So, if Kila siku Ryan learns both Kiingereza and Kichina at the same rate as before, it would take him approximately 13.2 seconds to learn both languages.
Response:  We know that Kila siku Ryan has studied for 6 months in Kiingereza, 7 months in Kichina, and 3 months in Kihispania. To find out how long he has studied overall, we need to add up these three periods of study. So, the total number of months that Kila siku Ryan has studied is:  6 + 7 + 3 = 16 months.
Response:  We know that Kila has studied for 6 months in Kiingereza, 3 months in Kichina and 58 months in Kihispania. To find out how much more time she spent studying Kiingereza compared to Kichina, we need to subtract the amount of time she spent studying Kichina from the amount of time she spent studying Kiingereza.  6 months - 3 months =?  6 - 3 = 3 So, Kila spent 3 more months studying Kiingereza than Kichina.
Response:  We know that Kila has studied for 7 years in English (Kiingereza), 2 years in Chinese (Kichina), and 4 years in Spanish (Kihispania). To find out how many more years she needs to study in order to be fluent in all three languages, we need to subtract the number of years she has already studied from the total number of years required to become fluent in each language.  1. Kiingereza: According to the question, Kila has studied for 7 years, but to become fluent in Kiingereza, she needs to study for 8 years. So, she still needs to study for 1 year more.  2. Kichina: Kila has studied for 2 years, but to become fluent in Kichina, she needs to study for 3 years. So, she still needs to study for 1 year more.  3. Kihispania: Kila has studied for 4 years, but to become fluent in Kihispania, she needs to study for 5 years. So, she still needs to study for 1 year more. Therefore, in total, Kila needs to study for 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 more years to become fluent in all three languages.
Response:  We know that Kila siku Ryan has studied for 2 years in Kiingereza, 5 years in Kichina and 4 years in Kihispania. To find out which language he has studied for the longest period of time, we need to compare the number of years he has studied each language.  1. Kiingereza - 2 years 2. Kichina - 5 years 3. Kihispania - 4 years Now, let's arrange these numbers from least to greatest: 2, 4, 5 So, based on the information given, Kichina is the language that Kila siku Ryan has studied for the longest period of time (5 years), followed by Kihispania (4 years) and then Kiingereza (2 years).
Response:  If Ryan can learn 3 words in Kiingereza every day and he learns 2 words in Kichina every day, then we need to find out how many days it will take for him to learn all the words in both languages.  1. Kiingereza: To learn 3 words per day, it will take = 3 x 30 = 90 days to learn all the words in Kiingereza.  2. Kichina: To learn 2 words per day, it will take = 2 x 30 = 60 days to learn all the words in Kichina. Since Ryan has to spend more time learning Kiingereza than Kichina, it means that he will finish learning Kichina before he finishes learning Kiingereza. Therefore, the total number of days required to learn both languages is: Total days = 90 + 60 = 150 days.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 days learning Kiingereza and 5 days learning Kichina. So, if we divide the total number of days he spent learning both languages by the number of days he spent learning each language separately, we get:  
Total days = 7 + 5 = 12 days  Days spent learning Kiingereza = 7 days  Days spent learning Kichina = 5 days  Now, let's calculate the ratio of the time spent learning Kiingereza to the time spent learning Kichina:  
Ratio = (Days spent learning Kiingereza) / (Days spent learning Kichina) = 7 / 5 = 1.4 This means that for every one day Ryan spent learning Kichina, he spent approximately 1.4 days learning Kiingereza."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jumatatu had 8 marbles and lost 3. So, he has 8 - 3 = 5 marbles left. Now, let's compare this with what Ali had before and after his turn. Before his turn, Ali had 7 marbles. After his turn, he gained 3 marbles from Jumatatu, so now he has 7 + 3 = 10 marbles. Therefore, Ali had more marbles than Jumatatu after their respective turns.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jumatatu had 7 macaroons and she gained 5 more macaroons. Therefore, the total number of macaroons Jumatatu has is:  7 + 5 = 12.  So, Jumatatu now has 12 macaroons.
Response: 1) If Tiffany had 4 macarons and she gave 2 to her friend, how many would she have left?  2) If she had 4 macarons left and she received 6 more, how many would she have in total? Solution:  1) If Tiffany had 4 macarons and she gave 2 to her friend, she would have 4 - 2 = 2 macarons left.  2) If she had 2 macarons left and she received 6 more, she would have 2 + 6 = 8 macarons in total.
Response: 1) If Tiffany had 8 pieces of candy and gave 4 to her friend Jumatatu, how many pieces would she have left?  2) How many pieces did Jumatatu receive from Tiffany? 3) What was the total number of candies that Jumatatu received from both sources (Tiffany and her mother)? Solution: 1) Tiffany has 8 pieces of candy and gives 4 to Jumatatu, so she has 8 - 4 = 4 pieces left. 2) Jumatatu receives 4 pieces of candy from Tiffany. 3) Jumatatu receives 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of candy in total (from both Tiffany and her mother).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany had 10 cookies and she gave 3 to her friend. So, how many cookies does Tiffany have left?  10 - 3 = 7 That means Tiffany has 7 cookies left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jumatatu had 8 cows and she gave 2 to her daughter. So, how many cows does Jumatatu have now?  8 - 2 = 6   Now, let's consider what happened after Jumatatu gave 2 cows to her daughter. We are told that after some time, Jumatatu got 10 more cows. So, if we add the number of cows Jumatatu had before (6) with the additional 10 cows, we get:  6 + 10 = 16   Therefore, Jumatatu has 16 cows in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiffany had $3 in her piggy bank and she spent $2 on candy. So, how much money does she have left?  3 - 2 =?  3 - 2 = $1  Now, let's look at the next part of the problem. Tiffany bought 7 more candies with the remaining $1. How many candies did she buy in total?  1 x 7 =?  1 x 7 = 7 candies  Finally, we need to find out how many chups Tiffany has. We are given that she has 44 chups. So, if she has 7 candies and each candy costs $0.50, then how much is 7 x $0.50 =?  7 x $0.50 = $3.50  Therefore, the jumla ya mifuko ya makopo aliyokuwa nayo ni $3.50.
Response:  We know that there are 17 pechis of Nyekundu and 16 pechis of Kijani in one kipa pu.   To find out how many more pechis of Nyekundu than Kijani, we need to subtract the number of pechis of Kijani from the number of pechis of Nyekundu.   So, we can say that there are 17 - 16 = 1 more pechi of Nyekundu than Kijani.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in a basket.  To find out how many more green apples than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples.   Total number of apples = 5 + 11 = 16  So, there are 16 apples in the basket. Now, let's compare the number of red apples to the number of green apples: Number of red apples = 5 Number of green apples = 11 Subtracting the number of red apples from the total number of apples gives us the number of green apples: 16 - 5 = 11 Therefore, there are 11 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 peaches in one basket and each basket has 15 peaches. So if we have 10 baskets of peaches, how many peaches will we have altogether?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of baskets (10) by the number of peaches in each basket (15):  10 x 15 = 150  Therefore, we will have 150 peaches altogether if we have 10 baskets of peaches with 15 peaches in each basket.
Response:  If there are 10 more yellow fruits in the basket than red fruits, and each yellow fruit has 5 more seeds than the corresponding red fruit, then we can start by finding out how many red fruits have 5 seeds.  5 x 2 = 10 So, there are 10 red fruits with 5 seeds each in the basket. Now, let's find out how many yellow fruits there are. Since there are 10 more yellow fruits than red fruits, if there are x red fruits, then there will be x + 10 yellow fruits.  We know that each yellow fruit has 5 more seeds than the corresponding red fruit, so the number of seeds in the basket is:  (x + 10) x 5 = 5x + 50  Simplifying, we get:  5x + 50 = 10x + 50  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  4x = 50  Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:  x = 12  Therefore, there are 12 red fruits in the basket with 5 seeds each, and since there are 10 more yellow fruits than red fruits, there will be 12 + 10 = 22 yellow fruits in the basket with 5 seeds each.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples, 15 green apples, and 8 yellow bananas in the basket. To find out how many fruits are in the basket altogether, we need to add up all these numbers. So, if we add 7 + 15 + 8, we get:  7 + 15 + 8 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 fruits in the basket altogether.
"Response:  We know that:  
Matunda 7 ya rangi nyekundu = 7 x 3 = 21  
Matunda 71 ya rangi ya manjano = 71 x 3 = 213  
Matunda 8 ya rangi ya kijani = 8 x 3 = 24  
To find out which one is greater, we can compare each pair of numbers:  
21 vs. 213: 21 is less than 213.  
24 vs. 213: 24 is less than 213.  
Therefore, matunda ya rangi ya kijani (24) is the smallest, followed by matunda 7 ya rangi nyekundu (21), and then matunda 71 ya rangi ya manjano (213)."
Response:  We know that there are 6 yellow oranges and 14 green oranges in the box.  To find out how many more green oranges than yellow oranges, we need to subtract the number of yellow oranges from the total number of oranges.  6 + 14 = 20 Total Number of Oranges So, there are 20 oranges in the box.  6 - 14 = -8 Subtracting 6 from 14 gives us -8. This means that there are 8 fewer green oranges than yellow oranges.  Therefore, there are 8 more yellow oranges than green oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red apples in total.  11 of them are ripe and ready to eat, while 12 are still green and not yet ripe.  So, if we subtract the number of green apples (12) from the total number of red apples (19), we get:  19 - 12 = 7  Therefore, there are 7 red apples left after removing the green ones.
Response:  We know that there are 90 yellow oranges in the box and each contains 4 pieces of fruit (kijani). Therefore, we can calculate how many pieces of fruit are in the box as follows:  90 x 4 = 360 pieces of fruit in the box.
Response:  We know that there are  18 yellow mangoes, 14 red mangoes and 17 green mangoes in the basket. To find out how many mangoes of each color are in the basket, we can use subtraction. First, let's subtract the number of red mangoes from the total number of mangoes to find out how many yellow mangoes are left:  18 - 14 = 4. So, there are 4 yellow mangoes left. Next, let's subtract the number of green mangoes from the total number of mangoes to find out how many yellow mangoes are left:  18 - 17 = 1. So, there is one yellow mango left. Therefore, there are 4 yellow mangoes, 1 red mango and 1 green mango in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 14 green apples in the basket.  Of these, 6 red apples and 14 green apples are rotten. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  5 red apples - 6 = 9 (number of healthy red apples)  14 green apples - 14 = 0 (no healthy green apples) So, there are 9 healthy red apples and no healthy green apples in the basket.
Response: 1st step is to calculate the total cost of all items (peaches) = 65 x 7 = 490 2nd step is to subtract the discount for 3 kilos of peaches = 490 - 3 x 18 = 490 - 54 = 436 So, the final price of 7 kilos of peaches after a 15% discount is 436.
Response:  We know that there are 11 pieces of fruit in total and each piece weighs between 10-18 grams. So, let's start by finding out how many pieces weigh 10 grams each.  11 x 10 = 110 grams Now, let's find out how many pieces weigh 18 grams each. 11 x 18 = 198 grams In total, there are 110 + 198 = 308 grams of fruit.
Response:  We know that there are 6 pieces of fruit in each pack (vika pu).   Each piece of fruit is either a peach or an apple. So, if there are 16 peaches and 18 apples, we can start by adding these numbers together to find out how many pieces of fruit there are in total:  16 + 18 = 34  Now, we know that there are 34 pieces of fruit in total. But we also know that there are 6 pieces of fruit in each pack, so we can divide the total number of pieces of fruit by 6 to find out how many packs there are:  34 / 6 = 5  Therefore, there are 5 packs of fruit in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 baskets of peaches and each basket has 10 pieces of peach. So, in total, we have 7 x 10 = 70 pieces of peach. Now, if we want to find out how many peaches are left after giving 2 pieces to each of the 3 children, we can calculate as follows:  2 x 3 = 6 pieces of peach will be given away. Therefore, the number of peaches left after giving away 2 pieces to each child is: 70 - 6 = 64 pieces of peach.
Response:  We know that there are 4 parachis in every kilogram of coffee beans and each parachi contains 3 kijani. Therefore, to find out how many kijani are in one kilogram of coffee beans, we can multiply the number of parachis by the number of kijani in each parachi. So, if we have 4 parachis, we multiply 4 x 3 = 12 kijani per kilogram of coffee beans.
Response:  We know that there are 12 peaches in each pack (vikapu).   If we have 2 packs of peaches, then we have a total of 2 x 12 = 24 peaches.  Now, if we want to distribute these peaches equally among 4 people, we can give each person 24/4 = 6 peaches.  So, each person will get 6 peaches.
Response:  We know that there are 16 beads in the rosary and 13 beads of the same color as the big bead at the end of the rosary. If we subtract the number of small beads from the total number of beads, we get:  16 - 13 = 3  So, the number of beads of the same color as the big bead is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 19 peaches in total and 4 of them are not ripe (kina). So, we can subtract 4 from 19 to get the number of ripe peaches:  19 - 4 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 ripe peaches.
Response:  We know that each parachichi has 4 and 6 pieces of beads, so we can start by listing out all possible combinations of beads for each parachichi: Parachichi 4: 4-piece combination = ABAB or ABAA or BAAB or BAAB Parachichi 6: 6-piece combination = ABCDE or ACDEB or BACDE or BACEF Now, let's look at how these combinations can be used to create a vikapu (bracelet) with 10 beads. For a vikapu with 10 beads, we need to use two parachichis. We can use one parachichi 4 and one parachichi 6, as shown below: Parachichi 4: 4 beads + 6 beads from Parachichi 6 = 10 beads Vikapu: ABAB + ACDEB = ABCDEFG The above combination uses all the beads from both parachichis and creates a vikapu with 10 beads. Therefore, the answer is ABCDEFG.
Response:  We know that there are 6 matundas of rangi ya kijani and each one has 60 rangis of manjano. So, in total, we have 6 x 60 = 360 rangis of manjano for all six matundas. Now, let's compare this to the number of rangis of manjano in one matunda of rangi ya kijani. One matunda has 60 rangis of manjano, so we can say that:  1 matunda = 60 rangis of manjano. Therefore, if we want to find out how many matundas of rangi ya kijani we need to get 2 ya rangi nyekundu katika kikapu, we can divide the number of rangis of manjano in 2 ya rangi nyekundu katika kikapu by the number of rangis of manjano in one matunda of rangi ya kijani:  2 ya rangi nyekundu katika kikapu =? x 60 rangis of manjano (where? is the number of matundas needed) To solve for?, we can divide 2 ya rangi nyekundu katika kikapu by 60 rangis of manjano:  2 ya rangi nyekundu katika kikapu = 2 / 60 = 1/30 = 3 matundas of rangi ya kijani.  So, we need three matundas of rangi ya kijani to get 2 ya rangi nyekundu katika kikapu.
"Response:  If Jerry had 4 items in his room that needed to be put away, and he put them all away, then there are no more items left in the room.  
So, if we start with 0 items (which is the same as saying ""no items""), and add 4 items (the number of items Jerry had), we get 4 items in total.  Now, if we take away 4 items (the number of items Jerry put away), we are left with... zero!  So, the final answer is 0 items."
"Response:  If Jerry had $7 in his wallet and spent $3 on something, he would have $4 left.  
So, if Jerry had $10 in his wallet initially, he would have $6 left after spending $3."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 4 items in his room and each item took up 22 square feet of space. So, the total area covered by all four items is:  4 x 22 = 88 square feet Now, if Jerry added six more items, each taking up the same amount of space as the previous items, the new total area would be:  6 x 22 = 132 square feet Therefore, the increase in the total area due to adding six more items is:  132 - 88 = 44 square feet
Response:  If Jerry had 5 items and each item weighed 9 kg, then he had a total weight of 5 x 9 = 45 kg.  Now, if he added 7 more items that also weigh 9 kg each, the total weight would be:  45 + (7 x 9) = 45 + 63 = 108 kg.  So, the additional weight of the 7 new items is 108 - 45 = 63 kg.
Response:  If Jerry had 2 items that each took up 10 space in his room and he added 4 more items, how much space would the new items take up in total?   First, let's calculate the total space taken up by the original 2 items:  2 x 10 = 20 spaces  Now, let's add the space taken up by the new 4 items:  4 x (10 - 2) = 4 x 8 = 32 spaces  So, the total space taken up by all 6 items is:  20 + 32 = 52 spaces
Response:  We know that Jerry had 8 books and he added 9 more books to make a total of 17 books. Now, if we subtract the original 8 books from the new total of 17 books, we get:  17 - 8 = 9 So, there are 9 extra books in addition to the original 8 books.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 items and each item took up 2 spaces in his room, then he had 7 x 2 = 14 spaces used up. Now, if he added 4 more items that also take up 2 spaces each, then he would have 4 x 2 = 8 additional spaces used up. In total, Jerry has used up  14 + 8 = 22 spaces in his room.
Response: 1st, we know that Jerry had 5 books and 2 more than 5 is 7. So he had 7 books in total. Now, if he added 9 more books to his collection, then the new total would be 7 + 9 = 16 books. Therefore, the number of additional books Jerry added was 9 - 5 = 4 books.
"Response: 
1. Jerry had 8 pencils in his bag. 2. He gave away 4 pencils to his friends. 3. So he has 8 - 4 = 4 pencils left. 4. Later, he found 5 more pencils. 5. Now he has 4 + 5 = 9 pencils in total.  Therefore, the total number of pencils Jerry has is 9."
Response:  If Jerry had 3 things in his room and he added 4 more things, then he has a total of 3 + 4 = 7 things in his room now.  If he removed 2 things from his room, then he is left with 7 - 2 = 5 things in his room.   So, if Jerry currently has 6 things in his room, he should remove 1 thing to match the number of things he had before adding 4 new things.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 items in his room and he kept them for 10 years, then he has 7 x 10 = 70 items now. But if he still has 8 items left, then he must have gotten rid of 70 - 8 = 62 items over the past 10 years. So, Jerry threw away 62 items during the past decade.
"Response:  If Jerry had $2 in his wallet and spent $1 on snacks, he would have $1 left.  
If Jerry then spent another $3 on toys, he would be left with $1 - $3 = -$2.  So, Jerry did not have any money left after buying the toys."
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 9 items to pack in his suitcase and he left out 7 of them. This means that he has  2 items remaining (9 - 7 = 2). Now, if he also has 10 other items that he wants to pack in the same suitcase, we need to subtract the number of items he already has (2) from the total number of items he wants to pack (10), which gives us:  8 items remaining to be packed (10 - 2 = 8). Therefore, Jerry can fit 8 more items in his suitcase.
Response: 1st, we have to calculate how many books (vitabu) can fit in the shelf (chumba). We know that each book takes up 1/3 of the space on the shelf. So, if there are 4 books on the shelf, they will take up 4 x 1/3 = 1 1/3 spaces. Since Jerry has 2 more books than the number of books on the shelf, he needs 2 + 1 1/3 = 3 1/3 spaces for his books. Therefore, the total number of books that can be placed on the shelf is 3 1/3.
Response: 1st, we know that Jerry had $7 and spent $3 on things in his room. That means he has $4 left ($7 - $3 = $4). Now, he bought two more things that cost $2 each. So, how much money does Jerry have now?  2 x $2 = $4 + $4 = $8. Therefore, Jerry has $8 now.
Response:  If there are currently 6 chicks in the nest and we want to know how many more will fit in the nest if each chick takes up 1 square unit of space, then we can start by finding out how many total squares are available in the nest.   The nest is shaped like a cube with sides of length 2 units. Therefore, the volume of the nest is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 cubic units. Since each chick takes up 1 square unit of space, we can fit 8/1 = 8 chicks in the nest. So, if there are already 6 chicks in the nest, then we can fit an additional 2 chicks in the nest (8 - 6 = 2).
Response:  If there are 4 birds in total and we want to know how many more birds will be added if we add 5 more birds, then we can start by finding out how many birds are already present in the group. So, let's count the number of birds mentioned in the problem:  1 bird + 2 birds + 3 birds = 6 birds. Therefore, there are currently 6 birds in the group. Now, if we add 5 more birds, the total number of birds will become: 6 + 5 = 11 birds. So, if we add 5 more birds to the current group of 6 birds, then there will be a total of 11 birds in the new group.
Response:  We know that there are 46 students in class and 6 more will be joining them. So, the total number of students will be:  46 + 6 = 52  Therefore, the answer is 52.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds (marabus) in the first nest and each bird lays 2 eggs. So, there will be 6 eggs in total in the first nest.   Now, we have 5 more birds (ndeges) coming to lay their eggs. Each of these birds will also lay 2 eggs. Therefore, there will be 10 eggs in total in both nests.
Response:  We know that there are 3 chickens in the first coop and each lays 4 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs laid by the chickens in the first coop is 3 x 4 = 12 eggs per day. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs the second coop needs to lay so that the total number of eggs produced daily is equal to 16 (the desired output). To do this, we subtract the number of eggs laid by the first coop from the desired output of 16:  16 - 12 = 4. Therefore, the second coop needs to lay 4 more eggs per day to meet the desired output of 16 eggs per day.
Response:  We know that there are 2 marabus and each has 6 cows. So together they have 2 x 6 = 12 cows. Now we need to find out how many more cows Ndeg√© 3 will bring if he brings fewer than 12 cows. To do this, we subtract 12 from 3 to get:  12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, Ndeg√© 3 will bring 9 cows less than what the two marabus have.
Response:  We know that there are 4 kunas and each has 6 marabus. So, in total, there are  4 x 6 = 24 marabus. Now, we are told that 2 more marabus will be added to the existing ones. Therefore, the new total of marabus will be: 24 + 2 = 26 marabus.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many bees (ndege) can fit in each hive (marabu). We know that there are 3 hives and each one has 4 compartments. So, we have 3 x 4 = 12 compartments in total. Now, let's calculate how many bees can fit in each compartment. We know that there are 6 more bees than the number of compartments. So, if there are 6 more bees, then the total number of bees will be 6 + 12 = 18 bees per compartment. Therefore, the total number of bees that can fit in all three hives is 18 x 3 = 54 bees.
Response:  We know that there are 6 chickens and each chicken lays an average of 3 eggs per day. So, in total, how many eggs do all the chickens lay in one day?   To find out, we multiply the number of chickens (6) by the number of eggs laid per chicken (3):  6 x 3 = 18 eggs   Therefore, all the chickens lay 18 eggs in one day.
Response:  We know that there are 4 dogs and each dog has eaten 3 bones. So, in total, 4 x 3 = 12 bones have been eaten. Now, we need to find out how many more bones the additional 6 dogs will eat. Since each dog eats 3 bones, 6 dogs will eat 6 x 3 = 18 bones. Therefore, the total number of bones eaten by all the dogs is 12 + 18 = 30 bones.
Response:  We know that there are 6 chickens in total and 4 of them have already been chosen for the market. So, we need to find out how many chickens are left.   To do this, we can subtract the number of chickens chosen from the total number of chickens: Total number of chickens - Number of chickens chosen = 6 - 4 = 2 Chickens left. Therefore, there are 2 chickens left in the farm.
Response:  We know that there are 5 birds in total and they have to share 4 seeds among themselves. So each bird will get 4/5 of a seed. Now we need to find out how many seeds the marabou got. To do this, we can use division.  4 / 5 = 0.8 (remember to simplify your answer)  Since each bird gets 0.8 seeds, the marabou got 0.8 x 4 = 3.2 seeds.
Response:  We know that there are 3 chickens in the first coop and 6 chickens in the second coop. If we add 2 more chickens to each coop, then:  1st Coop (3 + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5 Chickens 2nd Coop (6 + 2) = 6 + 2 = 8 Chickens So, the total number of chickens after adding 2 chickens to each coop is 5 + 8 = 13 chickens.
Response:  We know that there are five birds (A, B, C, D, and E) in the tree, and three of them (A, B, and C) have flown away. So, there are two birds left in the tree (D and E).   Now, we need to find out which bird is the fourth one that has not flown away. Since there are only two birds left in the tree, it means that neither of them has flown away yet. Therefore, both D and E are still in the tree.   So, the answer is: There are no birds that have flown away. All four birds (A, B, C, and D) are still in the tree.
Response: 1st, we know that there are two birds in the tree, and each bird has eaten one fruit. So, together they have eaten two fruits. Now, if we add another bird to the tree, it will eat one more fruit, making a total of three fruits eaten by all three birds. Therefore, the difference between the number of fruits eaten by two birds and the number of fruits eaten by three birds is three - two = one fruit.
Response:  We know that there are 3 chickens in the first coop and 6 chickens in the second coop. If we add 2 more chickens to each coop, then:  1st Coop (3 + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5 Chickens 2nd Coop (6 + 2) = 6 + 2 = 8 Chickens So, there will be 5 chickens in the first coop and 8 chickens in the second coop.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first surah has 48 verses and the second surah has 11 verses. So, if we subtract the number of verses in the first surah from the total number of verses, we get:   Total number of verses - Number of verses in the first surah = 11 + 48 = 59  Therefore, the difference between the two surahs is 59.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two suras (chapters) given in the question: Surah Kwanza and Surah Pili.  Secondly, we know that Surah Kwanza has 37 verses, while Surah Pili has 80 verses.  So, to find out which sura has more verses, we need to compare 37 with 80.   Clearly, 80 is greater than 37, so Surah Pili has more verses than Surah Kwanza.  Therefore, the numeric answer is:  Surah Pili has 80 verses, while Surah Kwanza has 37 verses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first sura has 60 verses and the total number of verses in the book is 93. Therefore, the second sura must have 33 verses (93 - 60 = 33).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 67 verses in Surah Al-Furqan (Chapter 2). Secondly, we need to find out which chapter has 67 verses. We can do this by looking at the list of chapters and their corresponding number of verses given in the question. Here is the list of chapters and their number of verses based on the information provided: Chapter 1 - 7 Verses Chapter 2 - 67 Verses Chapter 3 - 40 Verses Based on the above information, we can see that only Surah Al-Furqan (Chapter 2) has 67 verses. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Which chapter has 67 verses?"" is Surah Al-Furqan (Chapter 2)."
"Response:  Firstly, we have three suras (chapters) given in the question: Surat Al-Furqan (Chapter 2), Surat Al-Naba (Chapter 7), and Surat Al-Insan (Chapter 75). Next, we need to find out how many verses are there in each of these chapters. We can do this by counting the number of ayahs (verses) in each chapter. Here is the information about the number of ayahs in each chapter based on my knowledge of the Quran:  
Surat Al-Furqan has 10 ayahs (verses). Surat Al-Naba has 98 ayahs. Surat Al-Insan has 68 ayahs. Now that we know the total number of ayahs in each chapter, let's add them up to get the total number of ayahs for all three chapters combined: 10 + 98 + 68 = 176 ayahs. Therefore, the sum of the number of ayahs in the three chapters mentioned in the question is 176."
"Response:  To determine which sura has more verses than sura ya pili (surah al-Furqan), we need to compare their number of verses.  
Sura ya kwanza (surah al-Fatihah) has 91 verses, while sura ya pili (surah al-Furqan) has 23 verses. Therefore, sura ya kwanza has more verses than sura ya pili."
Response:  Firstly, we know that sura ya pili has 18 verses and sura ya tatu has 3 verses. So, if we subtract the number of verses in sura ya tatu from those in sura ya pili, we get:  18 - 3 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 more verses in sura ya pili than in sura ya tatu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three suras in total.  Secondly, we know that the first sura has 53 verses, the second sura has 75 verses, and the third sura has 21 verses.  So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  53 + 75 + 21 = 149.  Therefore, the total number of verses in the three suras is 149.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 chapters in the Quran. Secondly, we know that chapter 61 is the last chapter of the Quran. Therefore, to find out how many verses are in the entire Quran, we need to add up all the verses in each chapter from chapter 1 to chapter 31.   Verse count for each chapter: Chapter 1: 7 Verses Chapter 2: 280 Verses Chapter 3: 73 Verses Chapter 4: 54 Verses Chapter 5: 72 Verses... and so on until Chapter 31 with 6 verses. Total verse count: 280 + 73 + 54 +... + 6 = 2958 Verses So, the total number of verses in the entire Quran is 2958.
Response:  The first step is to identify the book and chapter numbers mentioned in the question.  Book number = 2 (Kitabu) Chapter number = 3 (Kurasa 23). Now we need to find out which verse is mentioned in this chapter. Verse number = 10. So the numeric answer would be:  2 x 23 x 10 = 460.
Response:  Firstly, we need to identify the chapter (surah) that has verse number 81 and find out which verses come before it.  Based on my knowledge of the Quran, Surah Al-Anbiya is the chapter with verse number 81. Now, let's count the verses before verse 81 in Surah Al-Anbiya.  Here are the verses before verse 81:   Verses 1 - 68. Therefore, the verse before verse 81 in Surah Al-Anbiya is verse 68.
"Response:  We know that; 
Watu 62 walikwenda kuchota asubuhi = 62 x 5 = 310 
Watu 39 walikwenda kuchota mchana = 39 x 4 = 156  
Now, we compare the two amounts; 
310 > 156 (true) 
So, more people walked to school in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that:  
Wapiga kambi 52 walikwenda kuchota maji asubuhi. This means that if we have 52 cows in the morning, we will have 52 x 2 = 104 cows at noon.  And if we have 104 cows at noon, we will have 104 x 3 = 312 cows in the evening. So, the number of cows we will have in the evening is 312. Therefore, the difference between the number of cows we will have in the evening and the number of cows we had in the morning is:  
312 - 52 = 260."
"Response:  If there are 15 children who go to school in the morning and each child drinks 1 cup of water before leaving for school, then together they would need 15 cups of water (15 x 1 = 15).  
Now, if 32 children come back home in the afternoon and each one of them also drinks 1 cup of water, then together they would need 32 cups of water (32 x 1 = 32).  
So, in total, we have 15 + 32 = 47 cups of water needed for all the children to drink."
Response:  We know that if we have 60 cents and we spend 1 cent every day for 60 days, we will be left with zero cents. So, if we start with 60 cents and spend 1 cent each day for 7 days, how much money will we have after 7 days?   To find out, let's use subtraction.  60 - 7 =?  Answer: 60 - 7 = 53  Therefore, if you start with 60 cents and spend 1 cent each day for 7 days, you will have 53 cents left.
Response:  We know that there are 36 people who go to work early in the morning (asubuhi), and 13 people who go to work late in the afternoon (mchana).  So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, the total number of people who go to work is 49.
"Response:  We know that there are 44 campers in total and they can be divided into three groups based on when they woke up: 
Group 1 (asubuhi): 39 campers  Group 2 (mchana): 31 campers  Group 3 (jioni): 4 campers  To find out how many more campers woke up early (asubuhi) compared to those who woke up late (mchana), we need to subtract the number of campers in group 2 from the number of campers in group 1:  39 - 31 = 8 So, there are 8 more campers who woke up early (asubuhi) than those who woke up late (mchana)."
Response:  We know that there are 53 campers in total and they have different amounts of water to drink.  Firstly, we can see that 48 campers have either 2 or 3 liters of water each. So let's add up their amounts:  2 liters x 48 = 96 liters + 3 liters x 48 = 144 liters = 240 liters. Now, we need to find out how much more water the remaining 5 campers have compared to the total amount of water the other 48 campers have. To do this, we subtract the total amount of water the other 48 campers have from the total amount of water all 53 campers have:  240 - 240 = 0 liters. Therefore, all 53 campers have the same amount of water to drink!
Response:  We know that watembezaji 33 and watembezaji 34 have 5 buckets of water each, so together they have  33 + 34 = 67 buckets of water.  Now we are told that watembezaji 10 has 2 buckets of water, so in total, watembezaji 10, 33, and 34 have  10 + 33 + 34 = 77 buckets of water.  Therefore, there is a difference of  77 - 67 = 10 more buckets of water for watembezaji 10 than for watembezaji 33 and 34 combined.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students who attended school that day. We can do this by adding up all the numbers in each group:  
Wapiga kambi 13 walioenda kuvua = 13 + 21 = 34  Wapiga kambi 59 walioenda kusafiri asubuhi = 59 + 34 = 93  Therefore, the total number of students who attended school that day is 93."
Response:  We know that there are 29 wapiga kambi walikwenda kuvua and they will be going on a safari in the morning. This means that each of them will need to bring 66 items with them for the safari. However, we also know that 26 of these wapiga kambi walikwenda kuvua will not be bringing any extra items with them. So, how many more items will the remaining 3 wapiga kambi walikwenda kuvua need to bring compared to the 26 who are not bringing anything extra? To find out, we can subtract the number of items brought by the 26 wapiga kambi from the total number of items needed for the safari: Total items needed = 66 Items brought by 26 wapiga kambi = 0 Therefore, the remaining 3 wapiga kambi must bring an additional 66 - 0 = 66 items. In other words, each of the remaining 3 wapiga kambi needs to bring 66 items for the safari.
Response:  We know that watembezaji 41 has 4 walikwenda (parts) and each part has 10 items. So, we can start by finding out how many items are in all of watembezaji 41's parts combined:  4 x 10 = 40  Now, we need to find out how many items are in watembezaji 26. Since it has 26 parts, we can multiply 26 by 10 to get:  26 x 10 = 260  Finally, we add up all the items from both watembezajis to get our total:  40 + 260 = 300  Therefore, the total number of items in watembezaji 41 and watembezaji 26 is 300.
Response:  We know that there are 46 campers in total and they have consumed water from three sources - A, B, and C. Source A has provided 10 liters of water, source B has provided 25 liters of water, and source C has provided 15 liters of water. Now we need to find out how much water each camper has consumed based on their distribution among the sources. Since there are 43 campers who have consumed water from all three sources, let's distribute the total amount of water (10 + 25 + 15 = 50) equally among them. So each camper has consumed 50/43 = 1.16 liters of water. However, since some campers have only consumed water from one or two sources, we need to adjust the calculation accordingly. For example, if a camper has only consumed water from source A, then they would have consumed 10 liters / 43 campers = 0.23 liters per camper. Similarly, if a camper has only consumed water from source B, then they would have consumed 25 liters / 43 campers = 0.58 liters per camper. And if a camper has only consumed water from source C, then they would have consumed 15 liters / 43 campers = 0.35 liters per camper. Therefore, the average amount of water consumed by each camper is: (0.23 + 0.58 + 0.35) / 3 = 1.16 liters.
Response:  If Rachel has 4 apples and each apple weighs 0.5 kg, then she has a total weight of 2 kg (4 x 0.5). Now, if the tree produces 7 fruits with the same weight as one apple, then the total weight of all the fruits produced by the tree would be 7 x 0.5 = 3.5 kg. So, the remaining weight that the tree needs to produce is 2 - 3.5 = 0.5 kg. Therefore, the number of fruits required to fill the basket is 1 (since 0.5 kg is equal to 1 fruit).
Response:  If Rachel had 4 cookies and she gave 2 to her friend, then she has  2 cookies left.  So, if she eats one more cookie, she will have no cookies left. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response: 1st, we know that Rachel has 7 cows and she sold  3 of them. So now she has 7 - 3 = 4 cows left. Now, if she has 4 cows and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, then in total, she will have 4 x 5 = 20 liters of milk per day.
Response: 1st, we know that Rachel has 2 cats now and each cat gives birth to 3 kittens. So, in total, Rachel has 2 x 3 = 6 kittens.  2nd, after some time, each of her cats will give birth to another litter of 3 kittens. So, she will have 6 + (2 x 3) = 6 + 6 = 12 more kittens. In all, Rachel will have 6 + 12 = 18 kittens.
Response: 1) The tree had 6 fruits (matofaa).  2) Now it has 2 fewer fruits because 2 fruits fell off (yaliyokomaa). Therefore, the current number of fruits is:  6 - 2 = 4. So, there are 4 fruits left on the tree.
Response: 1) The tree has 3 branches (matofaa).  2) Each branch has 2 leaves (yaliyokomaa). Therefore, we have 3 x 2 = 6 leaves in total.  3) However, there are also 27 small leaves (yasiyokomaa). So, the total number of leaves is 6 + 27 = 33 leaves.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many apples were in the tree initially. We know that there were 7 apples in the tree initially. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after 2 apples were picked. So, if 2 apples were picked, then there would be 7 - 2 = 5 apples left in the tree. Next, we need to find out how many apples were added to the tree later. According to the problem, 6 more apples were added to the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples in the tree now is 5 + 6 = 11 apples. Finally, we can see that the tree has 11 apples in it.
"Response: 
1. Rachel had 2 apples.  
2. She gave 2 apples to her friend.   
Now, Rachel has no apples left.  
So, there are no more apples in the tree. The correct answer is 0."
Response: 1) Rachel had 52 apples and gave two to her friend.  2) Now she has 50 apples left (52 - 2 = 50). 3) She now has 7 more apples than before (50 + 7 = 57). So, Rachel has 57 apples in total.
Response: 1st, we know that Rachel has 3 apples and she gave 8 to each of her friends, so she has no more apples left.  2nd, if she had 9 apples altogether, then after giving 8 to each friend, she would have 0 apples left. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response: 1) Rachel has 7 apples and she gives 3 to her friend. So, now she has 7 - 3 = 4 apples left.  2) Her friend has 3 apples given by Rachel, so together they have 4 + 3 = 7 apples.  3) Now, if we add the remaining apples that Rachel has (4), we get a total of 7 + 4 = 11 apples. Therefore, the sum of all the apples is 11.
Response:  If Ed has 19 more books than Doug, and Doug has 2 books, then we can start by finding out how many books Doug has.  2 + 2 = 4 So Doug has 4 books. Now let's find out how many books Ed has. Ed has 19 more books than Doug, so if Doug has 4 books, Ed must have 4 + 19 = 23 books. Therefore, Ed has 23 books and Doug has 4 books.
Response:  If Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, and Doug had 11 marbles, then Ed would have had  10 + 11 = 21 marbles.  Now, if Ed lost 45 marbles, he would be left with  21 - 45 = -24 marbles.  So, Ed would have negative 24 marbles.
Response:  If Ed had 22 marbles and gave 6 to Doug, then Ed would have  22 - 6 = 16 marbles left.  Since Doug has 7 marbles already, he would now have 7 + 6 = 13 marbles in total.
Response:  If Ed had 5 more than Doug, and Doug had 3 less than Ed, we can start by finding out how many more points Ed had than Doug.  5 - 3 = 2 So Ed had 2 more points than Doug. Now let's find out how many points Ed had in total. Since he had 2 more points than Doug, Ed had 2 + 3 = 5 points. Therefore, Ed had 5 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 24 marbles and lost 9. Therefore, he has 24 - 9 = 15 marbles now.   Secondly, we know that Doug had 27 marbles and gained 3. So, he has 27 + 3 = 30 marbles now. Finally, we need to find out how many more marbles does Doug have than Ed. To do this, we subtract Ed's current number of marbles (15) from Doug's current number of marbles (30): 30 - 15 = 15. Therefore, Doug has 15 more marbles than Ed.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 points before the game started and he scored 17 points during the game. So, if we subtract 17 from 29, we get:  29 - 17 = 12. Therefore, Ed has 12 points left after the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 19 marbles before and now he has 8 more than Doug. So, if Doug has x marbles, then Ed has x + 8 marbles. Secondly, we are told that Doug has 5 marbles. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:   x + (x+8) = 19 + 5  2x + 8 = 24  2x = 16   x = 8   Now, we know that Ed has 8 + 8 = 16 marbles.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 30 more points than Doug in the game. This means that if Doug scored x points, Ed scored x + 30 points. Secondly, we are given that Ed scored 21 points less than his total score. So, if Ed's total score was x + 30, he scored 21 points less, which is (x + 30) - 21. Finally, we want to find out how many points Ed would have scored if he had played with Doug when he was 91 years old. We can do this by substituting x = 91 into the equation (x + 30) - 21. Therefore, the number of points Ed would have scored if he had played with Doug at age 91 is:  
(91 + 30) - 21 =?"
Response:  If Ed had 12 marbles and lost 3, he would have  12 - 3 = 9 marbles left.  Now, if he gained 20 more marbles, he would have  9 + 20 = 29 marbles in total.  So, Doug has 29 - 3 = 26 marbles now.
Response:  We have 408 students who can eat 42 portions of food in one sitting. That means each student can eat approximately  408/42 = 9.67 portions of food. However, we are looking for the number of students who can eat more than 10 portions of food. To find this number, we need to subtract the number of students who can eat exactly 10 portions (which is 42/10 = 4) from the total number of students. So, the number of students who can eat more than 10 portions of food is:  408 - 4 = 394.
"Response:  We know that there are 479 students who have eaten lunch and 489 students who have not eaten lunch. So, if we subtract the number of students who have eaten lunch (479) from the total number of students (489), we get:  
489 - 479 = 10  Therefore, only 10 students have not eaten lunch."
Response:  We know that Sofia has 310 students in her class and she wants to divide them into groups of 4-6 students each. To do this, we need to find out how many groups of 4-6 students Sofia can make with 310 students.   First, let's find out how many groups of 4 students Sofia can make. If we divide 310 by 4, we get:  310 / 4 = 77 groups of 4 students   Now, let's find out how many groups of 6 students Sofia can make. If we divide 310 by 6, we get:  310 / 6 = 51 groups of 6 students   So, in total, Sofia can make 77 + 51 = 128 groups of either 4 or 6 students.
"Response: 
1st step: The total number of students who passed the exam is 288.  
2nd step: We know that 264 students passed the exam in the morning session.  
3rd step: Therefore, the number of students who passed the exam in the afternoon session is = Total - Morning passers (288 - 264) = 288 - 264 = 24.  
So, 24 students passed the exam in the afternoon session."
Response:  We know that there are 457 students in total and they have to share  100 pieces of meat equally among themselves. If we divide 100 by 457, we get approximately 0.22 pieces of meat per student. So each student will receive 0.22 pieces of meat. However, if some students do not eat beef, we need to adjust the number of pieces accordingly. If 63 students do not eat beef, then we have 457 - 63 = 394 students who will receive meat. Therefore, each of these students will receive approximately 0.22 x 394 = 83.68 pieces of meat.
Response:  We know that there are 182 students who have eaten lunch and 166 students who have not eaten lunch. To find out how many students have eaten nyama ya nguruwe, we need to subtract the number of students who have not eaten lunch from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 166 from 182, we get:  182 - 166 = 16 Therefore, 16 students have eaten nyama ya nguruwe.
"Response:  We know that in total, 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in the competition.  
Now, we need to find out how many students chose each of the three options.  From the problem statement, we can see that: 
* 324 students chose option A (chakula). 
* 374 students chose option B (nyama ya nguruwe). 
* 128 students chose option C (nyanya). 
So, if we subtract the number of students who chose option A from the total number of participants, we get:  
826 - 324 = 502 
This means that 502 students did not choose option A (chakula). 
Similarly, if we subtract the number of students who chose option B from the total number of participants, we get:  
826 - 374 = 452 
This means that 452 students did not choose option B (nyama ya nguruwe). 
Finally, if we subtract the number of students who chose option C from the total number of participants, we get:  
826 - 128 = 708 
This means that 708 students did not choose option C (nyanya). 
Therefore, the number of students who chose each of the three options is as follows:  
Option A (chakula): 324 students  
Option B (nyama ya nguruwe): 374 students  
Option C (nyanya): 128 students"
Response:  We have 257 students who are eating lunch in the school cafeteria. Of these, 120 are eating beef, 97 are eating chicken, and the remaining 30 are eating vegetables. How many more students are eating beef than those eating chicken? To solve this problem, we can use subtraction.  120 - 97 =? The difference between 120 and 97 is 23. Therefore, there are 23 more students eating beef than those eating chicken.
Response:  We have 144 students who are eating rice, and each student is eating an average of 467 grams of rice. That means that in total, they are consuming  144 x 467 = 65,828 grams of rice. Now, we have 79 students who are not eating rice but instead eating beef. Each student is eating an average of 300 grams of beef. So, the total amount of beef consumed by these students would be  79 x 300 = 23,700 grams. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed by all 223 students is  65,828 + 23,700 = 89,528 grams.
"Response:  We have 228 students who did not eat breakfast, and we want to know how many more students ate lunch than those who did not eat breakfast. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who did not eat breakfast from the total number of students. So, if there are 337 students in all, then:  

337 - 228 =? 

Answer: 109. Therefore, 109 more students ate lunch than those who did not eat breakfast."
Response:  We know that there are 450 students in total and 38 of them have chosen to eat bacon for breakfast. This means that 450 - 38 = 412 students have not chosen to eat bacon. Now, we need to find out how many of these 412 students have chosen to eat eggs for breakfast. Since there are 66 choices for each student, we can multiply 412 by 66 to get the total number of egg choices. Therefore, the answer is:  412 x 66 = 27992.
Response:  We know that there are 218 students who have eaten bacon and 351 students who have not eaten bacon. To find out how many students have eaten bacon, we can add 218 + 351 = 569. Therefore, 569 students have eaten bacon.
Response:  We know that there are 269 students who did not eat bacon, and 330 students who did not eat vegetables. Therefore, the total number of students who did not eat either bacon or vegetables is  269 + 330 = 609. Now, we need to find out how many students ate only one type of food. To do this, we subtract the number of students who ate both bacon and vegetables from the total number of students who did not eat either bacon or vegetables. The number of students who ate both bacon and vegetables is given as 76. So, we have:  609 - 76 = 533. Therefore, there were 533 students who ate only one type of food (either bacon or vegetables).
Response:  We know that Shuleni has 569 coins and Wavulana has 236 coins. To find out how many more coins Shuleni has than Wavulana, we need to subtract the number of coins Wavulana has from the number of coins Shuleni has.  569 - 236 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 333. So, Shuleni has 333 more coins than Wavulana.
Response:  We know that there are 34 students in class 841 and we want to find out how many more students are in class 841 than in class 34. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students in class 34 from the number of students in class 841. So, let's start by writing down the two numbers:  34 (class 34) + 841 =? (class 841) Now, let's subtract 34 from 841: 841 - 34 =? The difference between the two classes is:? - 34 = 807 Therefore, there are 807 students in class 841, which is 763 more than the number of students in class 34.
Response:  We have 485 students and 232 girls. To find out how many boys are there, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.  485 - 232 =?   Solution: Subtracting 232 from 485 gives us:  485 - 232 = 253.  So, there are 253 boys in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 697 people in total and 228 more than the number of women. So, if we subtract 228 from 697, we get the number of men:  
Men = 697 - 228 = 469."
Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total and 510 of them passed the examination. Therefore, the number of students who did not pass is:  635 - 510 = 125.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and 281 of them have laptops. So, we can start by subtracting 281 from 868 to find out how many students do not have laptops:  868 - 281 = 587   Therefore, there are 587 students who do not have laptops.
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in total and 142 more girls than boys. So, if we subtract 142 from 700, we get the number of boys.   Boys = 700 - 142 = 558. Therefore, there are 558 boys and 142 + 558 = 690 girls in school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in total and 222 of them have passed. So, to find out how many students failed, we subtract the number of passers from the total number of students:  706 - 222 = 484. Therefore, 484 students failed.
Response:  We know that there are 902 students in total and 811 of them passed the exam. So, the number of students who did not pass is:  902 - 811 = 91. Therefore, 91 students did not pass the exam.
Response:  We know that there are 632 students in total and 410 of them attend school daily. This means there are  632 - 410 = 222 students who do not attend school daily. Now we need to find out how many more students attend school than those who don't attend. To do this, we subtract the number of students who don't attend from the total number of students:  222 > 465. So, there are 465 - 222 = 243 students who attend school. Therefore, there are 243 more students who attend school than those who don't attend.
Response:  We know that wasichana 682 is less than wasichana 732 by 50 (732 - 682 = 50).   Now we need to find out how much wasichana 761 is greater than wasichana 732. To do this, subtract 732 from 761: 761 - 732 = 29. So, wasichana 761 is 29 more than wasichana 732. Therefore, wasichana 682 + 29 = 711.
Response:  We know that there are 135 students in class 214. If we subtract 496 (the number of students who transferred to another school) from 135, we get:  135 - 496 = -361 So, there are 361 fewer students in class 214 than there were originally. Now, let's find out how many students are left in class 214 after the transfer:  135 - 361 = 79 Students left in class 214 after the transfer.
"Response:  We know that there are 308 students in class 308 and 318 students in class 318.  If we subtract the number of students in class 308 from the number of students in class 318, we get:  
318 - 308 = 10  So, there are 10 more students in class 318 than in class 308. Now, let's find out how many teachers are needed for both classes. We know that each teacher can handle 36 students. Since there are 10 more students in class 318, we need one more teacher to teach those extra students. Therefore, we need a total of:  
308 / 36 = 9 teachers for class 308 + 1 teacher for class 318 = 10 teachers  So, there will be 10 teachers in total to teach both classes."
Response:  We know that Shuleni has 315 friends and she wants to add 309 more friends. So, if we add 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we have a total of 624 friends. But then we are asked how many teachers will be needed for this number of students. If there are 772 teachers available, and each teacher can handle 8 students, then we can divide 772 by 8 to get the number of classes required.  772 / 8 = 96 classes. Therefore, 96 classes will be required for Shuleni's 624 friends.
Response:  If there were 402 students in class and 739 students in total, how many classes would that be?   To find out, we need to divide the total number of students (739) by the number of students in each class (402).  739 / 402 =?  The result is... 1.83! That means there would be approximately 2 classes with 402 students each.
Response:  If there were 458 students in class and 692 students in total, then the number of students not in class is:  692 - 458 = 234.
Response:  We know that there are 362 students in total and 257 of them attend school daily. This means there are  362 - 257 = 105 students who do not attend school daily. Now we need to find out how many more students attend school than those who don't attend. To do this, we subtract the number of students who don't attend from the total number of students:  105 + 257 = 362. So, 362 is the correct answer.
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $2, he would have $18 - $2 = $16 left. So, Edward has $16 now.
"Response: 
Edward had $13 and spent $4. 
So he has $13 - $4 = $9 left.  
Now, Edward has $9 and spends another $2. 
So he has $9 - $2 = $7 left."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward had $9 and spent $8 more. So he spent in total of $9 + $8 = $17. Now, if he had $9 before spending any money, then after spending $8, he would have $9 - $8 = $1. Therefore, Edward had $1 before spending any money.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent Ksh. 92 on books and he had Ksh. 16 before buying the books. So, how much money did Edward have after buying the books? To find out, we subtract the amount he spent (Ksh. 92) from the money he had (Ksh.  16). Therefore,  Edward had Ksh. 6 left after buying the books.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $6 on 2 kilograms of sugar. So, the cost per kilogram of sugar is $6/2 = $3 per kilogram. Now, if he wants to buy 5 kilograms of flour, the total cost will be $3 x 5 = $15. Therefore, the remaining amount Edward has is $12 - $15 = $0.
Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $6 on 4 units of a good at $1.50 each. So he spent $6 x 4 = $24 on those goods. Next, we know that he spent $16 on 3 units of another good at $5 each. So he spent $16 x 3 = $48 on those goods. In total, Edward spent $24 + $48 = $72.
Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $4 on vitabu and $3 on kalamu, so he spent in total:  4 + 3 = 7 dollars.  Now, if he has $12, we can say that he has:  12 - 7 = 5 dollars left.
Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $16 on vitabu and $8 on kalamu, so he has spent in total $24.  Now, if he wants to buy more books or pens, he will have to spend $19 - $24 = $5 less than what he has already spent. Therefore, Edward can buy  5 units of either books or pens.
"Response: 
1. Edward had $17 and spent $10 to buy something from his friend. 
2. So he has $7 left.  3. But before spending the money, he had some change (coins) in his pocket. 
4. Since he bought something worth $10, he must have had at least $10 in coins. 
5. Therefore, Edward had $17 + $10 = $27 in total."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 more than Zachary. So we can start by finding out how many push-ups David did:  58 = 50 + 8 (since 50 is the number of push-ups Zachary did) Therefore, David did 50 + 8 = 58 push-ups. Now we need to find out the total number of push-ups done by both Zachary and David: Total = 44 + 58 = 102 push-ups. 
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did.  51 - 44 =?  The difference is 7. So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response: 1) David did 44 push-ups in class today.  2) Zachary did more than David because he did 9 more push-ups. So we can write an equation to represent this information as follows:  44 + 9 =? Solution: We add 44 and 9 to get our solution: 53 Therefore, Zachary did 53 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 push-ups. To find out who did more push-ups, we need to subtract the number of push-ups done by Zachary from the number of push-ups done by David.  51 - 49 = 2 So, David did 2 more push-ups than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches, while David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary but the same number of crunches as Zachary.   To find out how many push-ups David did, we can start with what Zachary did:  59 push-ups. If David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, then David did:  59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. So, David did 78 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches, while David did 29 push-ups and 13 crunches. To find out how many more crunches Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of crunches David did from the number of crunches Zachary did.  44 - 17 = 27 So, Zachary did 27 more crunches than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches, while David did 17 push-ups and 10 crunches. To find out who did more in total, we need to add up the number of push-ups and crunches for both individuals.   Push-ups: Zachary - 53, David - 17 Total = 70 Crunches: Zachary - 14, David - 10 Total = 24 Now, let's calculate the total score for each individual: Zachary - 70 + 24 = 94 David - 70 + 24 = 94 Both Zachary and David scored 94 points. Therefore, neither of them won or lost.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did more push-ups than David (35 vs. 58), but fewer crunches than David (3 vs. 87). So we can say that Zachary had more push-up strength than David, but less core strength.  
Numeric answer: The ratio of push-ups to crunches for Zachary is 35/3 = 11, while for David it is 58/87 = 0.67. Therefore, Zachary had an advantage in push-ups but a disadvantage in crunches compared to David."
Response:  We know that Zachary did more crunches than push-ups and David did fewer crunches than push-ups. So we can start by comparing their crunches and push-ups numbers.   Crunches: Zachary - 58, David - 62. Since both are positive integers, we can compare them directly. Therefore, David did more crunches than Zachary (62 > 58). Push-ups: Zachary - 46, David - 38. Comparing these two numbers, we see that Zachary did more push-ups than David (46 > 38). Now let's find out how many more crunches David did compared to push-ups. To do this, subtract David's push-up number from his crunches number: 62 - 38 = 24. So David did 24 more crunches than push-ups. Finally, we need to determine if Zachary did more crunches or push-ups. Based on our previous analysis, we know that David did more crunches than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary did fewer crunches than David. As for push-ups, Zachary did more push-ups than David. In summary, Zachary did more push-ups but fewer crunches than David. Numeric answer:  Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches, while David did 38 push-ups and 62 crunches.
"Response:  We know that:  
Zachary did 19 push-ups.  David did more than Zachary, so David did at least 19 push-ups.  John did fewer push-ups than David, so John did fewer than 39 push-ups.  Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let D be the number of push-ups done by David. Since David did more than Zachary, we know that D > 19.  Also, since John did fewer push-ups than David, we know that J < D.  Now we have two equations:  
D > 19... (1)  
J < D... (2)  Can you solve for D using these two equations?"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in class today. Next, we are told that David did more than Zachary, so let's say David did 51 + x push-ups where x is the difference between David and Zachary's number of push-ups. We also know that John did fewer push-ups than David, so John did 51 + x - 4 = 47 push-ups. Therefore, John did 47 push-ups.
"Response:  We know that:  
Zachary did 15 push-ups in class today.  David did 39 more than Zachary.  John did 9 more than David. So we can start by finding out how many push-ups David did:  
David did 39 more than Zachary, so:  
David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups Today, John did 9 more than David, so:  
John did 54 + 9 = 63 push-ups Today. Therefore, Zachary did fewer push-ups than John by:  
63 - 15 = 48 push-ups."
Response:  If David did 30 push-ups and then Zachary did 37 push-ups, we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David by subtracting the number of push-ups David did from the total number of push-ups Zachary did.  37 - 30 = 7 So Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
"Response:  If David did 38 push-ups and Zachary did 56 push-ups, we can start by finding out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David. To do this, we subtract the number of push-ups that David did from the number of push-ups that Zachary did:  
Zachary did 56 push-ups - David did 38 push-ups =?  We can fill in the blank with the correct number:  
56 - 38 = 18  So, Zachary did 18 more push-ups than David."
"Response:  We know that David did 40 push-ups and Zachary did 34 push-ups. So, if we subtract the number of push-ups done by Zachary from the number of push-ups done by David, we get:  
David - Zachary =?  
40 - 34 = 6  
Therefore, David did 6 more push-ups than Zachary. Now let's look at the crunches. We know that David did 17 crunches and Zachary did 62 crunches. So, if we subtract the number of crunches done by Zachary from the number of crunches done by David, we get:  
David - Zachary =?  
17 - 62 = -45  
This means that David did 45 fewer crunches than Zachary."
Response:  We know that David did 36 push-ups and 33 crunches, while Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did:  58 - 36 = 22  So, Zachary did 22 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David did 27 push-ups and Zachary did 5 push-ups. To compare these numbers, we need to find out how many times 5 is greater than 27.  5 x 5 = 25 (5 squared) 27 - 25 = 2 (27 minus 25) So, Zachary did 2 more push-ups than David. However, we are also given that Zachary did 17 crunches while David did 7. To compare these numbers, we can use the same method as before: 7 x 7 = 49 (7 squared) 17 - 49 = -32 (17 minus 49) Since -32 is less than 2, we can conclude that Zachary did fewer crunches than David. Therefore, the correct answer is: Zachary did fewer crunches than David.
Response:  We know that Rachel has 5 tasks for her class and 2 tasks for her teacher. So we can start by writing down these numbers:  5 (class tasks) + 2 (teacher tasks) = 7 total tasks.  Now, let's look at each task and determine how long it will take Rachel to complete each one. For example, maybe she can finish all 5 class tasks in 30 minutes, and both teacher tasks in 20 minutes. So we can write down our estimate like this:  30 min (class tasks) + 20 min (teacher tasks) = 50 min total time.  Therefore, Rachel needs 50 minutes to complete all 7 tasks.
Response:  If Rachel had work experience as an accountant for 3 years and then worked as a teacher for 4 years, we can calculate the total number of years she has worked as follows:  3 + 4 = 7 years.  Therefore, Rachel has worked for a total of 7 years.
Response:  If Rachel had 5 tasks for grading and her workload was increased to 7 tasks, then she would have 2 additional tasks (7 - 5 = 2).   Therefore, Rachel would have 2 extra tasks for marking.
Response:  If Rachel had 7 tasks for grading and she completed 4 more tasks than the number of tasks for reading, then we can start by finding out how many tasks she did for reading.   To do this, we need to subtract the number of tasks she completed (4) from the total number of tasks she had (7).   So, if we subtract 4 from 7, we get:  7 - 4 = 3  Therefore, Rachel did 3 tasks for reading.
Response:  If Rachel had 8 tasks to complete and she completed 3 more than the number of tasks she was given (kasi ya kusoma), then she completed 8 + 3 = 11 tasks in total.
Response:  If Rachel had 8 jobs as an accountant and she did more than 6 jobs for calculating salaries, then she must have done at least 7 jobs (since 6 + 1 = 7). So, the number of jobs Rachel did for calculating salaries is 7.
Response:  If Rachel had 10 jobs as an accountant and each job took her 3 hours to complete, then she spent a total of  10 x 3 = 30 hours working as an accountant.  However, if she spent 3 more hours reviewing the work done by others, then she spent a total of  3 + 30 = 33 hours working in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel has three jobs: job 2, job 3, and biology (job 10). To calculate the total number of hours she works per week, we need to add up the hours for each job.   Job 2: 5 hours/week x 4 weeks = 20 hours/month Job 3: 6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours/month Biology (job 10): 8 hours/week x 4 weeks = 32 hours/month Total hours worked per month: 20 + 24 + 32 = 76 hours/month Now let's convert this to an annual salary based on a 12-month year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can multiply the monthly hours by 12: Annual hours worked: 76 hours/month x 12 months = 912 hours/year Based on the information provided, Rachel works approximately 912 hours per year across her three jobs.
Response:  We know that Rachel had work experience in three subjects: mathematics (kurasa 9), English (kurasa 2), and biology (kurasa 96). To find out how much more experience she has in mathematics than in English, we need to subtract the number of years she spent in English from the number of years she spent in mathematics.   Mathematics: 9 years Biology: 96 years - 2 years = 94 years So, Rachel has 94 more years of experience in mathematics than in English.
Response:  We know that Rachel had 11 classes in total, and she taught 2 classes of mathematics and 3 classes of biology. So, how many classes did she have left for other subjects?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of classes she taught from the total number of classes she had. Total number of classes = 11 Classes taught = 2 + 3 = 5 Subtracting the number of classes taught from the total number of classes gives us: 11 - 5 = 6 Therefore, Rachel had 6 classes left for other subjects.
"Response:  We know that Rachel had work experience in class 7, class 11, and biology class 8. To determine which subject she was more experienced in, we need to compare the number of classes she taught for each subject.  
Class 7: Rachel taught for 1 class (herself). Class 11: Rachel taught for 0 classes (no experience). Biology class 8: Rachel taught for 1 class (herself).  Based on this information, it appears that Rachel has more experience teaching class 7 than either class 11 or biology class 8. So, if we had to choose one subject for her to teach based solely on her past experience, it would be class 7."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel had work experience in three subjects: Biology (subject 29), Mathematics (subject 9), and Chemistry (subject 11). Secondly, we are asked if she had any experience in teaching or tutoring. So, let's assign a value of 1 to each subject where she has teaching or tutoring experience, and a value of 0 otherwise. Finally, we add up all the values to get our total score.  
Total Score = (1 x Subject 9) + (1 x Subject 11) + (0 x Subject 29) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel had 8 tasks for her accounting class, and she completed 7 of them. So, the number of tasks left for her to complete is:  8 - 7 = 1 task. Secondly, we know that she had 3 tasks for her biology class, and she finished all of them. Therefore, the total number of tasks Rachel completed is:  1 + 3 = 4 tasks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to teach five classes for each subject, so she will have 5 x 3 = 15 classes in total.   Secondly, we know that she needs to spend twice as much time teaching Biology and Kiswahili as she does for other subjects, so she will spend 2 x 6 = 12 hours teaching these two subjects.   Finally, we know that she needs to spend 10 hours teaching Mathematics, which means she will have 10 - 12 = 2 hours left for other activities.   Therefore, the number of hours Rachel spends on her job is 2 hours.
"Response: 1st we need to find out how many times ""kusoma"" appears in the text. We can do this by counting the number of appearances of each word in the text.  2nd, we need to find out how many times ""hesabu"" appears in the text. Once we have these two numbers, we can compare them to determine which word is used more frequently. To count the number of appearances of each word, we can use a simple formula: (number of occurrences) = (total words) x (frequency of word). For example, if there are 50 total words and ""kusoma"" appears three times, then (number of occurrences of ""kusoma"") = (50) x (3/50) = 6. So ""kusoma"" appears six times in the text. Similarly, if ""hesabu"" appears five times, then (number of occurrences of ""hesabu"") = (50) x (5/50) = 10. Therefore, based on our calculation, ""hesabu"" appears more frequently than ""kusoma""."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had work experience in class 4 (kusoma), class 7 (hesabu), and class 19 (biology). To determine which job was more challenging for her, we need to compare the difficulty levels of these classes.  
Class 4 (Kusoma): This is a basic subject that focuses on reading and writing skills. It may not be as challenging as other subjects like math or science. Level of difficulty: Low.  Class 7 (Hesabu): This subject involves mathematical calculations and problem-solving, which can be quite challenging for some students. Level of difficulty: Medium to High.  Class 19 (Biology): Biology is a complex scientific subject that requires a deep understanding of living organisms and their interactions. It can be very demanding, especially for those who are not interested in the subject. Level of difficulty: High.  Based on the above analysis, it appears that Rachel found the work in class 19 (biology) more challenging than the work in class 4 (kusoma) or class 7 (hesabu). Therefore, the correct answer is:  C. Biology (class 19) was the most challenging subject for Rachel."
Response:  We know that jack has 6 apples in the morning and 2 more in the afternoon. So, if we add 2 to 6, we get... 8! That means Jack has 8 apples altogether.
Response:  We know that Jack has $6 in the morning and spends $2 on breakfast, so he has $6 - $2 = $4 left. Then, he spends another $2 on lunch, so he has $4 - $2 = $2 left. Finally, he spends $1 on snacks, so he has $2 - $1 = $1 left. Therefore, Jack has $1 left after spending all his money.
Response:  If we have 4 apples in the morning and each apple is divided into 5 pieces, then we will have 4 x 5 = 20 pieces of apple altogether. So, if we want to know how many apples we will have after dividing them into 5 pieces each, the answer is 20.
Response:  We know that Jack has 6 apples in the morning, and he eats 3 of them at noon. So, how many apples does Jack have left after lunch?   To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of apples Jack eats (3) from the total number of apples he had (6). Here's the calculation:  6 - 3 =?  The answer is:  6 - 3 = 3  Therefore, Jack has 3 apples left after lunch.
"Response:  We know that Jack has $5 in the morning and spends $8 at noon. Then he receives $72 later in the day. So we can start by listing what Jack has at each time of day:  
Morning (8am): $5  Noon (12pm): $0 (he spent all his money) Evening (8pm): $72  Now we need to find out how much Jack has after each transaction.  At noon, Jack spends $8, so he has $5 - $8 = $(-3).  Later in the evening, Jack receives $72, so he has $(-3) + $72 = $69.  Therefore, Jack has $69 in the evening."
"Response:  We know that Jack has $4 in the morning, $5 at noon, and $8 in the evening. So we can list his daily expenses like this:  
$4 (morning) + $5 (noon) + $8 (evening) =?  Now let's add up all of these amounts to find out how much money Jack has in total for the day:  
$4 + $5 + $8 = $17  Therefore, Jack has $17 for the entire day."
Response:  We know that Jack has $3 in his pocket in the morning and spends $4 at lunchtime. So he has $3 - $4 = $-1 left in his pocket after lunch. Then, we know that he has $8 in his pocket in the evening. So, he must have received $8 + (-$1) = $7 more in the evening. Therefore, the total amount of money Jack had throughout the day was $3 + $7 = $10.
"Response:  We know that Jack has $10 in the morning and spends $7 at lunchtime. So he has $10 - $7 = $3 left after lunch. Then he spends another $17 in the evening, so he has $3 - $17 = -$14 left at night. Therefore, Jack has less money at night than he did in the morning.  

Question: Jack alipokea barua pepe 10 asubuhi, barua pepe 7 mchana na barua pepe 17 jioni. Ni barua pepe ngapi zaidi alizopokea Jack asubuhi kuliko mchana? 
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that Jack has $10 in the morning and spends $7 at lunchtime. So he has $10 - $7 = $3 left after lunch. Then he spends another $17 in the evening, so he has $3 - $17 = -$14 left at night. Therefore, Jack has less money at night than he did in the morning."
"Response:  We know that Jack has $9 in his pocket in the morning and spends $3 on lunch, leaving him with $6. Then he finds $4 more, so now he has $6 + $4 = $10. Finally, he spends $2 on dinner, leaving him with $10 - $2 = $8. So, Jack has $8 left after dinner.  
Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Jack had at night ($8) and what he had in the morning ($9) is: 
$8 - $9 = $-1 (or negative one)."
Response:  We know that Jack has $10 in his pocket and he spends $5 on breakfast. So, how much money does Jack have left after breakfast?  ü§î $10 - $5 = $5 üí∞ Yes! Jack has $5 left after breakfast.
Response:  If we have  6 + 3 = 9 breakfasts and each breakfast has 2 chapatis, then we have 9 x 2 = 18 chapatis in total. Now, if we want to know how many chapatis we will have after eating for 10 days (i.e., consuming 10 x 2 = 20 chapatis), we can subtract the number of chapatis consumed from the total number of chapatis available. Therefore, the answer is:  18 - 20 = -2 chapatis.
Response:  We know that Jack has $3$ dollars in his pocket and he spends $54$ cents on breakfast. So, how much money does Jack have left after buying breakfast?   First, let's calculate how much money Jack spent on breakfast: $54$ cents = $\$0.54$. Now, we subtract the amount Jack spent from the amount of money he had: $\$3.00 - \$0.54 = \$2.46$. Therefore, Jack has $\$2.46$ left after buying breakfast.
Response:  We know that Jack has $5 in his pocket in the morning and spends $2 on breakfast, so he has $5 - $2 = $3 left. Then, we know that he spends another $2 on lunch, so he has $3 - $2 = $1 left. Finally, we know that he spends $1 on dinner, so he has $1 - $1 = $0 left at night. Therefore, Jack has $0 in his pocket at night.
Response:  We know that Jack has $10 at 8 am and spends $3 at 3 pm. So, how much does he have left after spending $3?   To find out, we can subtract $3 from $10:   $10 - $3 = $7   Therefore, Jack has $7 left after spending $3 at 3 pm.
"Response:  We know that Jack has $6 in his pocket in the morning and spends $2 on breakfast, leaving him with $4. Then he receives $7 from his mother, so now he has a total of $11. Therefore, Jack has $5 more in the afternoon than he did in the morning.  
So, the answer is 5."
Response:  We know that Jack has $6 in his wallet and he spent $2 on breakfast, so he has $6 - $2 = $4 left.   He also has $74 in his savings account, so together he has $4 + $74 = $78.
Response:  We know that Jack has $4 in his pocket in the morning and spends $2 on breakfast. So he has $4 - $2 = $2 left in his pocket after breakfast.   Now we are told that Jack has $6 in his pocket at noon and spends $8 on lunch. So he has $6 - $8 = $0 left in his pocket after lunch.  Therefore, Jack has $2 left in his pocket in the afternoon.
Response:  If Jack has J = 9 pieces of candy and he gives 7 pieces to his friends in the morning, then he has J - 7 = 2 pieces left in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack has $3 in his pocket in the morning and spends $5 at noon. So he has $3 - $5 = -$2 left in his pocket after noon. Then, he receives $16 in the evening, so he now has $16 + (-$2) = $14.   Therefore, Jack has $14 in his pocket in the evening.
"Response:  If we have  3 mchana of rice and each mchana has 6 asubuhi (units), then we have in total:  
3 x 6 = 18 units of rice.  Now, if we want to know how many days this amount of rice can last for, assuming one unit per day, we need to divide the total number of units by the number of units per day:  
18 / 1 = 18 days.  So, the amount of rice can last for 18 days if consumed at a rate of one unit per day."
Response:  We know that Panzi had 9 churros and gave 3 to his friend, so he has 9 - 3 = 6 churros left.   His friend has 3 churros. So together they have 6 + 3 = 9 churros.
Response:  We know that Panzi had 31 coins and gave 4 coins to Chura. So, now Panzi has  31 - 4 = 27 coins.  Next, we know that Chura received 4 coins from Panzi and already had  35 coins, so Chura now has  35 + 4 = 39 coins.  Therefore, the total number of coins is  27 + 39 = 66 coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nzige has 36 inches and Panya has 17 inches more than Nzige. So, Panya has 36 + 17 = 53 inches.   Next, we are told that Chura has 15 inches less than Panya. Therefore, Chura has 53 - 15 = 38 inches.  Finally, we need to find out how many inches Umbali is shorter than Chura. We can do this by subtracting Chura's length from Umbali's length. Since Umbali has 38 inches, and Chura has 38 - 15 = 23 inches, therefore Umbali is shorter than Chura by 23 - 38 = -15 inches.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Panzi has 25 years and Chura has 18 years. So, if they have a child together, the age of the child will be between 25 and 18, which is 21 years old (middle value).  
Now, let's consider how many years older or younger than the child must be to make it possible for Panzi and Chura to have a child together. We can do this by subtracting their ages from the age of the child.  For Panzi, the difference would be:  
Panzi's age - Child's age = 25 - 21 = 4 years older  
For Chura, the difference would be:  
Chura's age - Child's age = 18 - 21 = -3 years younger  
So, the youngest Chura could have been when she was 18 - 3 = 15 years old, and the oldest Panzi could have been when he was 25 + 4 = 29 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nzige has 19 points and Chura has 20 points. So, if we compare their scores directly, Chura has more points than Nzige.   However, the question also states that Panya has 10 points less than Nzige. Therefore, to find out how many points Panya is behind Nzige, we can subtract 10 from 19:  19 - 10 = 9  So, Panya is 9 points behind Nzige.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Nzige has 19 years and Panya has 39 years. So if we subtract Nzige's age from Panya's age, we get:  
39 - 19 = 20  Secondly, we are told that Chura is 94 years old. If we subtract Chura's age from Panya's age (which we just calculated), we get:  
20 - 94 = -74  Therefore, Chura is 74 years older than Nzige."
Response: 1. Panzi had 25 shillings and spent 6 shillings on something.  2. She then received 32 shillings more.  3. After receiving the additional amount, she now has a total of 26 shillings. So, the difference between what Panzi had before spending any money (25) and what she had after receiving the additional amount (26) is: 26 - 25 = 1 shilling. Therefore, Panzi spent 1 shilling on something.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Nzige has been away for 24 hours and Panya has been away for 33 hours. Next, we are told that Nzige was away for 5 days less than Panya. So, if Panya was away for x days, then Nzige was away for (x - 5) days. Now, let's convert both numbers to years:  
Nzige was away for (x - 5) days \* 24 hours/day = (x - 5) * 24 years  
Panya was away for x days \* 24 hours/day = x * 24 years  
Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  
(x - 5) * 24 = x * 24 + 5  
Simplifying the equation:  
24x - 120 = 24x + 5  
Solving for x:  
-120 = 5  
x = 24  
So, Panya was away for 24 years and Nzige was away for 19 years (since they were away for the same amount of time, but Nzige missed 5 days)."
"Response: 
1. Panzi had 13 cows and she lost one cow (chura) to Kuruka.  
2. Now, Panzi has 12 cows left. 
3. Chura took two more cows from Panzi, so Panzi now has 12 - 2 = 10 cows left. 
Therefore, Umbali gani? (What is left?) Answer: Panzi has 10 cows left."
Response: 1st, we know that Pankaj has Rs. 35 and he spent Rs. 4 more than Panzi. So, Panzi spent Rs. 4 + 35 = Rs. 39. Now, let's find out how much money Panzi has.  39 - 35 = Rs. 4. Therefore, Panzi has Rs. 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nzige has 19 points and needs to gain 4 more points to reach Panya's score of 23. So, Nzige needs to win 4 games against Panya.   Secondly, we know that Panya has 44 points and needs to lose 4 games to Nzige to reach her score of 40. Therefore, Panya needs to lose 4 games against Nzige.   Finally, we can see that if Nzige wins all her games against Panya, she will have 19 + 4 = 23 points, while Panya will have 44 - 4 = 40 points.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that panzi has 39 teeth and each tooth is worth 19 shillings. So, if panzi had 39 teeth, he would have earned 39 x 19 = 761 shillings. However, it's written that panzi aliruka inchi 12 chini ya chura, which means he spent 12 shillings on something. Therefore, the amount of money panzi has left is 761 - 12 = 749 shillings.  
So, the answer is 749 shillings."
Response:  Firstly, we know that nzige has 21 points and needs to gain 9 more points to reach 25 points. Secondly, we are given that panya has 16 points. So, if nzige were to play against panya, they would need to win at least 3 games (16 + 9 = 25). Therefore, the difference between nzige and panya is 9 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Chura has 39 points and Panzi has 17 points. Now, we need to find out how many more points does Chura have than Panzi. To do this, we can subtract the number of points that Panzi has from the number of points that Chura has:  39 - 17 = 22 So, Chura has 22 more points than Panzi.
Response: 1st, we know that Panzi has 9 coins and Chura has 3 coins.  2nd, We are told that Chura gave 3 coins to Panzi. Therefore, Panzi now has 9 + 3 = 12 coins. 3rd, We are asked how many coins Chura has after giving 3 coins to Panzi. Since Chura had 3 coins initially, she still has 3 coins. So, Chura has 3 coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Panzi has 14 coins and Chura has 16 coins.   Secondly, we are told that Chura gave 37 coins to Panzi. Therefore, we can start by subtracting 37 from 16 to find out how many coins Chura had before giving any to Panzi.  16 - 37 =?   Answer: 16 - 37 = 0 So, Chura had no coins left after giving all of them to Panzi. Now, let's check if this makes sense. We know that Panzi started with 14 coins and received 37 coins from Chura. Therefore, the total number of coins Panzi has now is: 14 + 37 =?  Answer: 14 + 37 = 51 So, Panzi has 51 coins now.
Response:  We know that Mary has 14 beads in her necklace and she gives 6 of them to her friend. So, how many beads does Mary have left?   To find out, we can subtract 6 from 14:  14 - 6 =?   The answer is:  8  Now, if Mary gives 5 more beads to her friend, how many beads will she have left?   To find out, we can subtract 5 from 8:   8 - 5 =?   The answer is:  3  Therefore, after giving 5 more beads to her friend, Mary will have 3 beads left in her necklace.
Response:  We know that Mary has 9 apples and she gives  2 to her friend. So, after giving 2 apples, Mary will have 9 - 2 = 7 apples left. Now, if we add the number of apples she has (7) with the number of apples her friend has (2), we get: 7 + 2 = 9. Therefore, the total number of apples Mary and her friend have is 9.
Response:  We know that Mary has eaten 6 pieces of sugar and she still needs to eat 7 more pieces to reach her target of 13 pieces. If we subtract  6 from 13, we get 7. So, Mary needs to eat 7 more pieces of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has eaten 11 pieces of unga and 7 pieces of sukari. If she had eaten 2 more pieces of sukari, she would have eaten a total of 9 pieces of sukari (2 + 7). Therefore, the number of pieces of unga Mary needs to eat to reach her target of 10 pieces is 10 - 9 = 1 piece of unga.
Response:  We know that Mary has 11 sweets and she gives 3 to her friend. So, Mary is left with  11 - 3 = 8 sweets. Now, if she wants to share these remaining 8 sweets equally among 6 of her friends, each friend will get  8 / 6 = 1 sweet.
Response:  We know that Mary has 12 pieces of candy and she gives 5 to her friend Sukari. So, Mary is left with  12 - 5 = 7 pieces of candy. If she wants to give 2 more pieces to her friend, she will have  7 - 2 = 5 pieces of candy left. Therefore, the correct answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Mary has $9$ dollars and she spends $5$ dollars on sweets. So, she has $9 - 5 = 4$ dollars left.   Next, we know that Mary spends $3$ dollars on another thing, so she has $4 - 3 = 1$ dollar left. Finally, we know that Mary has $1$ dollar left and she gives it to her friend as a gift. Therefore, the answer is $1$.
Response:  We are given that Mary has $5$ coins of one type and $14$ coins of another type. She also has $10$ coins of a third type and $2$ coins of a fourth type. We need to find out how many coins of each type she has in total.   First, let's count the number of coins of each type that Mary has:   Type 1 (5 coins): 5 x $1 = $5   Type 2 (14 coins): 14 x $1 = $14   Type 3 (10 coins): 10 x $1 = $10   Type 4 (2 coins): 2 x $1 = $2   Now, add up all the amounts to get the total amount of money that Mary has: Total = $5 + $14 + $10 + $2 = $31 So, Mary has $31$ in total.
Response:  We know that Mary has 12 pieces of candy in total and she wants to divide them equally among her friends. She gives 5 pieces to Sukari and 49 pieces to Chumvi. That means she has 11 pieces left for herself.   So, if we subtract the number of pieces she gave away (5 + 49 = 54) from the total number of pieces she had (12), we get:  12 - 54 = -42   Therefore, Mary has -42 pieces of candy left for herself.
Response:  We know that Mary has $10 in her wallet and she spends $2 on sweets. So, she has $10 - $2 = $8 left.   Now, if she buys 7 apples at $1 each, how much will she have to pay in total?   Total cost = 7 x $1 = $7.   Since she has $8 left, she can afford to buy the apples without going over her budget.   Therefore, after buying the apples, Mary will have $8 - $7 = $1 left in her wallet.
Response:  We are given that Mary has 12 pieces of candy in her bag and she gives 2 to her friend. So, after giving 2 candies away, Mary will have  12 - 2 = 10 pieces of candy left in her bag. Now, we need to find out how many more pieces of candy Mary needs to buy so that she can have as much candy as her friends who have 14, 14, and 7 pieces of candy respectively. To do this, we compare the number of pieces of candy each person has with what Mary has left after giving 2 candies away.  14 > 10 (Mary has fewer pieces of candy than her first friend) 14 > 10 (Mary still has fewer pieces of candy than her second friend) 7 > 10 (Mary has even fewer pieces of candy than her third friend) Therefore, Mary needs to buy at least 7 + 14 + 14 = 35 pieces of candy to catch up with her friends. However, since Mary already has 10 pieces of candy left, she only needs to buy 35 - 10 = 25 additional pieces of candy.
Response:  We are given that Mary has $6$ dollars and she spends $2$ dollars on sugar and $3$ dollars on charcoal. So, after buying these items, Mary will have $6 - 2 = 4$ dollars left and $6 - 3 = 3$ dollars left respectively. Now, we need to find out how much money Mary will have in total if she buys all three items. To do this, we add the amount of money she has left for each item:  4 + 3 = 7 dollars. Therefore, Mary will have $7$ dollars in total if she buys all three items.
Response:  To get from Vikombe 12 to Vikombe 13, we need to add  1 to Vikombe 12. So, Vikombe 13 = Vikombe 12 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.  Now, to get from Vikombe 13 to Vikombe 2, we need to subtract 11 from Vikombe 13. So, Vikombe 2 = Vikombe 13 - 11 = 13 - 11 = 2.
Response: 1st step is to calculate the total number of bricks required for the wall using Vikombe 9 and Vikombe 6. Total = (Vikombe 9 x 2) + (Vikombe 6 x 3) = 18 + 9 = 27 bricks.  2nd step is to subtract the number of bricks already used in the foundation from the total number of bricks required. Subtracting 4 bricks used in the foundation gives us the remaining number of bricks needed for the wall. Remaining = Total - 4 = 27 - 4 = 23 bricks. Therefore, we need 23 bricks more to complete the wall.
Response:  We know that Mary has eaten six pieces of sugar and nine pieces of bread. If she has eaten two more pieces of bread, how many pieces of bread will she have in total?   To find out how many pieces of bread Mary will have if she eats two more, we need to add two to the number of pieces she already has (nine). So, Mary will have:  9 + 2 = 11 pieces of bread.
Response:  We are given that Mary has $5$ dollars and she spends $2$ dollars on candy. So, how much money does Mary have left?   To find out, we can subtract $2$ from $5$, like this: $$5 - 2 =?$$ Do you know what the result is?  It looks like Mary has $\boxed{3}$ dollars left after buying candy! Now, let's move on to the next part of the problem.  We are also told that Mary spends $1$ dollar on a toy. So, how much money does Mary have left now?  Can you use subtraction again to find out? Remember to be careful when you calculate!
Response:  We know that Mary has $3$ dollars in her pocket and she wants to buy sweets with it. She can buy $3$ packets of sweets each costing $1$. So, she will have $3\times 1 = 3$ dollars left after buying the sweets. Now, if she wants to buy more sweets with the remaining amount, she needs to find out how many more packets she can buy. To do this, we need to divide the remaining amount by the cost of one packet of sweets. So, we divide $3$ by $1$ to get $\frac{3}{1} = 3$. This means Mary can buy $3$ more packets of sweets with the remaining amount of $3$ dollars. Therefore, the total number of packets of sweets Mary can buy is $3 + 3 = 6$.
Response:  We know that Mary has eaten 5 pieces of sugar and 13 pieces of bread. If she had eaten 12 more pieces of bread, she would have eaten a total of 13 + 12 = 25 pieces of bread. However, we are asked if she could have eaten 12 more pieces of bread and still have some left over. To determine this, we need to find out how many pieces of bread she would have been left with after eating 12 more.   So, let's subtract the number of pieces of bread she ate (13) from the total number of pieces she would have eaten (25): 25 - 13 = 12. Therefore, if Mary had eaten 12 more pieces of bread, she would have been left with 12 pieces.
Response:  We know that Mary has $6$ dollars and she spends $14$ dollars on sugar. So, how much money does Mary have left after buying sugar?   To find out, we can subtract the amount spent on sugar from the initial amount of money Mary had:   $6 - 14 =?$   Can you solve for the missing number?
Response:  We know that Mary has 11 sweets in her bag and she gives 9 of them to her friend. So, how many sweets does Mary have left?   To find out, we can subtract 9 from 11:  11 - 9 =?   Yes, that's right! Mary has 2 sweets left.
Response:  We know that Mary has $3$ pieces of candy and she gives $2$ to her friend. So, she is left with $3 - 2 = 1$ piece of candy.   Now, if she eats $6$ more candies, she will have $1 + 6 = 7$ pieces of candy in total. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) $7$.
Response:  We know that Mary has $9 in her savings account and she wants to buy a toy that costs $14. She also has $40 in her piggy bank and she wants to save some money for later. If she spends all of her savings account money on the toy, how much will she have left in her piggy bank after buying the toy?   To find out how much Mary will have left in her piggy bank, we need to subtract the cost of the toy from the amount of money she has in her piggy bank. So, if we subtract $14 from $40, we get: $40 - $14 = $26  Therefore, after buying the toy, Mary will have $26 left in her piggy bank.
Response: 1st priority is to give preference to those with higher marks in KCSE. So we will start by comparing Vikombe 9 and Vikombe 7. Since Vikombe 9 has a higher mark than Vikombe 7, we will assign Vikombe 9 to Unga. Now let's compare Vikombe 7 and Vikombe 4. Since Vikombe 7 has a higher mark than Vikombe 4, we will assign Vikombe 7 to Unga. Next, we will compare Vikombe 4 and Vikombe 2. Since Vikombe 4 has a lower mark than Vikombe 2, we will assign Vikombe 2 to Chumvi. Therefore, the final allocation of students to Unga and Chumvi based on their KCSE marks is as follows: Vikombe 9 - Unga Vikombe 7 - Unga Vikombe 4 - Chumvi Vikombe 2 - Chumvi
Response:  We know that Mary has 11 sweets in her bag and she gives 6 to her friend Unga.  üç≠üëß Now, Mary is left with 5 sweets (11 - 6 = 5).  If she gives 3 more sweets to Chumvi, she will have no sweets left! üò± So, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Mary has 7 sweets and she gives  2 to her friend. So, how many sweets does Mary have left?  7 - 2 = 5   Therefore, Mary has 5 sweets left.
Response:  We are given that Mary has $12$ dollars from her grandmother and $14$ dollars from her uncle. She wants to buy candy with these funds. If she buys $10$ dollars worth of candy, how much will she have left after buying the candy?   First, let's calculate how much candy Mary can buy with each amount of money:  With $12$ dollars, she can buy $\$12 \div 5 = 2$ bags of candy ($5$ dollars per bag).  With $14$ dollars, she can buy $\$14 \div 5 = 2 + 1 = 3$ bags of candy ($5$ dollars per bag plus $1$ dollar remaining).  Now, let's find out how much Mary will have left after buying the candy:  If she buys $2$ bags of candy with the $12$ dollars, she will be left with $\$12 - 2 \times 5 = \$12 - 10 = \$2$.  If she buys $3$ bags of candy with the $14$ dollars, she will be left with $\$14 - 3 \times 5 = \$14 - 15 = \$9$.  Therefore, if Mary buys $10$ dollars worth of candy, she will have $\$9$ left after buying the candy.
Response:  If there are 19 cows in total and 6 of them will be given away for free, then we can subtract 6 from 19 to find out how many cows will remain with the family.  19 - 6 = 13 So, 13 cows will remain with the family after giving away 6 cows for free.
Response:  If there are 87 chickens in total and 7 of them will be sent to the market, how many chickens will remain on the farm?   To find out, we can subtract 7 from 87:   87 - 7 =?   The answer is:  80 chickens will remain on the farm.
Response:  We know that there are 20 goats in total and 14 of them belong to family A. So, the number of goats belonging to family B is  20 - 14 = 6.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 85 birds in total and 23 of them will go to Africa while 37 will go to Asia. So, if we subtract 23 from 85, we get 62. Therefore, the number of birds left behind is 62.  
Now, let's consider the distribution of birds among the two continents. If 23 birds go to Africa and 37 birds go to Asia, then the number of birds going to each continent can be represented as follows:
Africa - 23 birds
Asia - 37 birds
Therefore, the remaining 62 birds will be distributed equally between the two continents, with 31 birds going to each continent."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 sheep in total and they will be divided into two groups of 42 and 31 respectively. Now, let's calculate how many more sheep will go to Africa than to Asia. To do this, we need to subtract the number of sheep going to Asia from the total number of sheep. Total number of sheep = 8 So, the number of sheep going to Asia = 31 (since there are 31 sheep going to Asia) Number of sheep going to Africa = 8 - 31 = 5 (Since there are 5 sheep less going to Asia compared to Africa) Therefore, there will be 5 more sheep going to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 birds in total and they will be divided into two groups of 47 and 94 respectively. Now, let's calculate how many birds will be left for each group if all the birds were to go to either Africa or Asia.   For the first group (47), we have:  47 - 38 = 9 birds left over For the second group (94), we have:  94 - 38 = 56 birds left over Therefore, the number of birds going to Africa is 9, while the number of birds going to Asia is 56.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 chickens in total and they will be divided into two groups of 38 each for Africa and Asia respectively.  
Now, let's calculate how many chickens will go to Africa and Asia: 
Africa - 38 chickens x 2 groups = 76 chickens 
Asia - 38 chickens x 2 groups = 76 chickens 
Therefore, the number of chickens going to Africa is 76 and the number of chickens going to Asia is also 76."
Response:  We know that there are 87 goats in total and 18 of them will be left behind if the family moves to the new place. So, we can start by subtracting 18 from 87:  87 - 18 = 69. Therefore, there will be 69 goats remaining with the family after they move to the new place.
Response:  We know that there are 49 goats in total and they belong to two families. The first family has 24 goats and the second family has 25 goats. So, if we subtract 24 from 49, we get 25 as the number of goats left over for the second family. Therefore, the second family has 25 goats.
"Response:  If there are 27 goats in total and each family has an average of 41 goats (6 x 7), then how many families will have fewer than 7 goats?  
To find out, we need to divide 27 by 7. 
27 / 7 =? 
Answer:  4 
So, four families will have fewer than 7 goats."
Response:  We know that there are 86 people in total who have been affected by the drought and have come to seek water from the well. Of those 86 people, 45 of them have already received water and have gone back home. That means there are 41 people left who still need water (86 - 45 = 41).   So, if we want to distribute the remaining water equally among these 41 people, each person would receive approximately  41/45 = 0.91 liters of water.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 birds in total and they belong to two families - Family A with 35 birds and Family B with 62 birds. Now, we need to find out which family has more birds going to Africa or Asia. To do this, we can use subtraction.  
Family A is going to Africa and Asia, so let's subtract the number of birds going to Africa from the total number of birds in Family A:  
35 - 20 (birds going to Africa) = 15 (birds remaining in Asia) 
Now, let's do the same for Family B:  
62 - 40 (birds going to Africa) = 22 (birds remaining in Asia) 
So, Family B has more birds remaining in Asia than Family A. Therefore, the answer is Family B."
Response:  We know that there are three families with 10 goats each (3 x 10 = 30 goats). Additionally, two families have 5 goats each (2 x 5 = 10 goats), and one family has 4 goats (1 x 4 = 4 goats). In total, we have 30 + 10 + 4 = 44 goats. Therefore, the number of goats that will be left after all the families have sent their goats to the market is 44 - 26 = 18 goats.
"Response:  We know that Paul had $253 in his savings account at the beginning of the school year and he spent $70 during the year. So, to find out how much money Paul has left in his savings account now, we need to subtract $70 from $253.  
$253 - $70 =?

"Response:  We know that Paul has $551 and he wants to divide it equally among 177 people. So, if we divide $551 by 177, we get:  
$551 √∑ 177 =?  
To find out what each person will receive, we can multiply the result of our division by 100 (since there are 100 cents in one dollar):  
$551 √∑ 177 x 100 =?  
So, each person will receive:  
$551 √∑ 177 x 100 = $3.24  
Therefore, Paul will have $3.24 left after dividing the money equally among 177 people."
"Response:  We know that Paul has $440 and he wants to divide it equally among his 111 friends. So, if we divide $440 by 111, we get:  
$440 √∑ 111 =?  
We can simplify this division by using long multiplication:  
$440 x 1/111 =?  
Now, we can see that 1/111 is equal to 0.0090909... (repeating). So, we have:  
$440 x 0.0090909... =?  
To find out what number multiplied by 0.0090909... gives us $440, we can use our calculator:  
$440 x 0.0090909... ‚âà 3658.72  
Therefore, Paul will give each of his 111 friends $3658.72."
Response:  We know that Paul has $65 for the week and he spends $16 on groceries every day. So, how much will he have left after one week?   First, let's calculate how much he spends in one week:  1 week x $16 per day = $16 x 7 days = $112   Now, let's subtract what he spends from what he has:   $65 - $112 = $43   Therefore, Paul will be left with $43 after one week.
"Response:  We know that Paul has $589 in his savings account and he wants to divide it equally among his 5 friends. So, if we divide $589 by 5, we get:  
$589 √∑ 5 =?  
We can simplify this division problem as follows:  
$589 √∑ 5 = $117  
So, each of Paul's 5 friends will receive $117 from his savings account."
"Response:  We know that Paul has $110 in his savings account and he wants to divide it equally among his 90 friends. So, if we divide $110 by 90, we get:  
$110 √∑ 90 =?  
We can simplify this division problem as follows:  
$110 √∑ 90 = 110 x 1/90 = 110 / 90 = 1 1/9  
So, each friend will receive $1 1/9 of the total amount, which is $110. Therefore, the answer is:  
Each friend will receive $1 1/9 or $110 / 90 = $1.22 per friend."
Response:  We know that Paul had $563 at the beginning of the year and he spent $558 during the year. So, how much money did Paul have left after spending $558? To find out, we can subtract $558 from $563:  563 - 558 =?   Answer:  $563 - $558 = $7. Therefore, Paul had $7 left after spending $558.
"Response:  If we have $52$ weeks in a year and each week has $7$ days, then there are $52 \times 7 = 364$ days in a year. Now, if we subtract the number of days in a leap year ($366$) from the total number of days in a year, we get:  

$$364 - 366 = 2$$

So, there is a difference of $2$ days between a common year and a leap year. Therefore, if we start with $492$ days (which is the number of days in a leap year), we can subtract $2$ to get the number of days in a common year:  

$$492 - 2 = 490$$

Therefore, the number of days in a common year starting on Monday is $490$."
"Response:  We know that Paul has $521 and wants to buy 66 items at $66 each. So he needs to calculate how much money he will have after buying all these items. To do this, we can use subtraction.   First, let's find out how much money Paul will spend on all the items:  66 x $66 =? (Answer: $4,396) Now, let's subtract the amount spent from the total amount of money Paul has: $521 - $4,396 =? (Answer: -$3,875) Since Paul spends more than what he has, he won't be able to buy all the items. Therefore, the correct answer is ""he won't be able to buy any item."""
"Response:  We know that Paul has $531 and he needs to buy 38 items. So we can start by dividing $531 by 38 to find out how much each item costs.  
We can do this using long division or by rounding up to the nearest dollar. For simplicity, let's use long division.  
$531 √∑ 38 =?  
First, we divide 5 by 38:  
5 √∑ 38 = 0 remainder 5 (5 x 38 = 190)  
Next, we add 5 to the quotient:  
0 + 5 = 5  
So, $531 divided by 38 is equal to 5 with a remainder of 5. This means that each item costs $5 plus $5 remaining, for a total of $10 per item."
Response:  We know that Paul has $601 and he wants to divide it among his friends so that each one gets an equal share. If there are 406 people in total, how much will each person get if they split the money equally?   To find out, we can use division. In this case, we have:  601 (total amount of money) √∑ 406 (number of people) =? (amount each person gets)  Now let's calculate:  601 √∑ 406 = 1.5 (answer)  So each person will get $1.50 from the $601.
"Response:  We know that Paul had $291 at the beginning of the school year and he spent $315. So, we can start by subtracting $315 from $291 to find out how much money Paul had left after spending $315.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Mhudumu had 11 cows and he sold 8 of them. So, how many cows does he have left?  2ndly, We are told that after selling 8 cows, he was left with 3 cows. Therefore, the number of cows he has now is 3. Finally, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to buy so that he can have as many cows as he had before (11). To do this, we subtract the number of cows he has now (3) from the total number of cows he had before (11): 11 - 3 = 8.  So, Mhudumu needs to buy 8 more cows to have as many cows as he had before.
Response: 1. The first person had three watermelons. 2. After sharing one watermelon with two people, they were left with three - three minus two equals one. So, the first person was left with one watermelon.  3. Now, let's look at the second person. They started with four watermelons and shared one with two people. Four minus two is equal to two. Therefore, the second person has two watermelons.
Response:  We know that after 9 years, the child will be 9 + 3 = 12 years old. So, the person who was 3 years old at birth will be 12 - 3 = 9 years old after 9 years. Therefore, the person who was 3 years old at birth is now 9 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mhudumu had 14 cows and he sold 5 of them. So, how many cows does Mhudumu have left?   To find out, let's subtract 5 from 14.  14 - 5 =?   Can you do this subtraction in your head or on paper?   The answer is... 9!  Yes, Mhudumu has 9 cows left.
Response:  If Mhudumu had 13 marbles and gave 4 to Wengine, then she would have  13 - 4 = 9 marbles left.  So, if she had 9 marbles and took away 4 more, she would be left with  9 - 4 = 5 marbles.
Response:  First, we know that Mhudumu had 12 cows when he was 12 years old.  Next, we are told that when he was 15 years old, he sold 3 cows. So, at age 15, Mhudumu had 12 - 3 = 9 cows. Finally, we are asked how many cows Mhudumu would have if he were 14 years old. To find this, we need to subtract the number of cows he sold (3) from the number of cows he had at age 15 (9):  9 - 3 = 6  Therefore, Mhudumu would have 6 cows if he were 14 years old.
Response:  If Mhudumu had 3 cows and each cow gave birth to one calf, then he would have 3 + 3 = 6 cows in total. However, it is given that after some time, Mhudumu had 8 cows. So, if we subtract 3 (the original number of cows) from 8, we get:  8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, Mhudumu's 5 cows are the result of his initial 3 cows giving birth to new calves.
Response: 1. The difference between 8 and 5 is 3. 2. The product of 3 and 99 is 300. Therefore, the missing number is 300.
Response:  If Mhudumu had 12 years old and now she is 14 years old, then she has added 2 years.   Therefore, if Mhudumu was 12 years old and now she is 14 years old, she has been alive for 12 + 2 = 14 years.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $3 on ice cream and he has $2 left. So, if we subtract $3 from $2, we get:  
$2 - $3 = $2 - 3 = $0  
Therefore, Dan has no money left after buying ice cream."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent Ksh. 3 on something and then he had Ksh. 4 left. So, if we subtract Ksh. 3 from Ksh. 4, we get:   Ksh. 4 - Ksh. 3 = Ksh. 1 Therefore, Dan has Ksh. 1 left after spending Ksh. 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $4 on something and he has $3 left. So, if we subtract $4 from $3, we get:   $3 - $4 = $-1 This means that Dan does not have any money left! However, the problem states that he has $3 left, so there must be some mistake in our calculation. Let's check again. We know that Dan spent $4 on something, and he had $3 left, so we can write this as an equation:   $3 - $4 = -$1 Now, let's add $4 to both sides of the equation to fix the mistake:   $3 + $4 = $7 Now we have $7, which is the correct amount of money that Dan has left after spending $4. Therefore, the answer is $7.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he wants to buy two pieces of candy for $4 each. So, we can start by calculating how much money Dan needs in total to buy both pieces of candy.   Total amount = 2 x $4 = $8   Since Dan only has $3, he doesn't have enough money to buy both pieces of candy. Therefore, the value of one piece of candy is more than $3.   Value of one piece of candy = $8 / 2 = $4   Now, let's calculate the cost of one piece of candy in terms of the number of pips (small round objects) it takes to equal its value.   Cost of one pip = Value of one piece of candy / Number of pips = $4 /?   To find out the number of pips needed to equal the value of one piece of candy, we need to divide the value of one piece of candy by the cost of one pip.   Number of pips = Value of one piece of candy / Cost of one pip = $4 /?   Solving for the number of pips, we get:   Number of pips = $4 /? = $4 / $1 = 4   Therefore, one piece of candy costs four pips.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $2 on something and he has $6 left. So, if we subtract $2 from $6, we get:  
$6 - $2 = $4  Now, we are told that he spent $3 on something else. So, if we subtract $3 from $4, we get:  
$4 - $3 = $1  Therefore, Dan has $1 left after spending $2 and $3."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $7 on something and he has $2 left. So, if we subtract $2 from $7, we get:  
$7 - $2 = $5  
Now, we know that Dan spent $5 on chocolate because he has $3 left after buying it. Therefore, if we subtract $3 from $5, we get:  
$5 - $3 = $2  
So, the amount of money Dan has left is $2."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $4 on alicha kwa $7 and $6 on chokoleti. So, in total he spent $4 + $6 = $10.   Now, if he had not bought the two items, how much money would he have saved?  We can calculate this by subtracting the amount he spent from the initial amount of money he had.  So, $10 - $4 = $6. Therefore, Dan would have saved $6 if he had not bought the two items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $2 on alcohol and $6 on food. Therefore, his total expenses are: Total Expenses = $2 + $6 = $8 Now, if he wants to buy a chocolate worth $3, he will have to spend more money. So, the amount of money he needs to spend is: Amount Needed = $3 - $8 = -$5 Yes, you read it right! Dan needs to spend negative $5 to buy a chocolate worth $3 because he already spent all his money on alcohol and food.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $5 on something and he has $2 left. So, if we subtract $2 from $5, we get:  
$5 - $2 = $3 Now, we know that Dan spent $3 on chocolate. Therefore, the amount of money Dan has left is:  
$2 - $3 = $-1 This means that Dan does not have enough money to buy chocolate. "
Response: 1st step is to calculate how much money Dan has after buying the item for $4. 2nd step is to find out how much money Ana has after spending $8. Finally, we need to determine how much money Rafiki has after receiving $5 from his friend.   Calculation: Step 1: Dan pays $4 for the item. So, he has $4 - $4 = $0 left. Step 2: Ana pays $8 for her item. So, she has $8 - $8 = $0 left. Step 3: Rafiki receives $5 from his friend. So, he has $5 + $0 = $5 left. Therefore, the amount of money each person has is as follows: Dan: $0 Ana: $0 Rafiki: $5
"Response:  If Daniel had $3 and spent $1 on candy, how much money does he have left?  
$3 - $1 = $2  So, Daniel has $2 left.  Now, if Daniel had $4 and spent $2 on candy, how much money does he have left?  $4 - $2 = $2  So, Daniel has $2 left again!  It looks like no matter how much money Daniel spends on candy, he always has $2 left over."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $4 and he wants to buy 10 pens at $3 each. So, if he buys all the pens, how much money will he spend in total?   To find out, we can multiply the number of pens (10) by the price of one pen ($3):  10 x $3 = $30  Therefore, Dan will spend $30 if he buys all the pens.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he wants to buy 2 bags of potatoes at $4 each. So, we can start by calculating how much money Dan will spend in total if he buys both bags of potatoes.   To calculate this, we multiply the cost of one bag of potatoes ($4) by the number of bags Dan wants to buy (2):  4 x 2 = 8 Now we know that Dan will spend $8 in total if he buys both bags of potatoes.  But wait! Dan only has $3, so he doesn't have enough money to buy both bags of potatoes. He needs an additional $5 to buy both bags.  So, the missing amount that Dan needs is:  5 - 3 = 2
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $5 on chocolate and $3 on a drink. So, in total he spent $8. Secondly, we are asked to find out whether it is better for him to buy a pipe or not. To do this, we need to compare the cost of the pipe with what he has already spent. The cost of the pipe is $7. Therefore, if we subtract the amount he has already spent ($8) from the cost of the pipe ($7), we get:  
$7 - $8 = -$1 This means that buying the pipe would be more expensive than what he has already spent, so it is not advisable for him to buy it. In other words, it is better for him to spend his money on something else rather than buying the pipe."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the cost of one chocolate and one bottle of soda separately.  1 chocolate = $4 1 bottle of soda = $7 Total cost = $4 + $7 = $11 Now, let's compare the total cost of buying one chocolate and one bottle of soda with the cost of buying only one chocolate. Cost of one chocolate = $4 Cost of one bottle of soda = $7 Total cost of both = $11 Cost of one chocolate alone = $4 So, it is cheaper to buy one chocolate and one bottle of soda than to buy only one chocolate.
Response:  First, we know that Paul has 115 pages in total. Secondly, he has used 78 pages for his garage plan. So, to find out how many pages are left, we can subtract 78 from 115: 115 - 78 =?   The result is 37 pages left. Therefore, Paul has 37 pages remaining after using 78 pages for his garage plan.
Response:  We know that Paul had 137 pages in his book and he burned 105 of them. So, how many pages are left in the book after burning 105 pages? To find out, we need to subtract the number of pages burned (105) from the total number of pages (137). Here's the calculation:  137 - 105 =? The result is: 32 pages are left in the book after burning 105 pages.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and he gave 35 of them to his friend as a gift. So, how many books does Paul have left?   To find out, we can subtract 35 from 108:  108 - 35 =?   The result is:  73   Therefore, Paul has 73 books left after giving 35 to his friend.
Response:  If Paul had 50 words and he used 151 words in his speech, then he spoke for:  151 - 50 = 101 words more than he was supposed to speak.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul has 150 books in total and he has already read 58 of them. So, to find out how many more books he needs to read, we can subtract the number of books he has read from the total number of books he has:  150 - 58 =?  The answer is 92. Therefore, Paul needs to read 92 more books.
Response:  If Paul had 21 books and he gave away 42 books, then he has no more books left (21 - 42 = 0). So, if he has no books left, it means that he doesn't have any book with him now. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul had $71 and he spent $38 on groceries. So, how much does he have left?  
$71 - $38 = $33  
Therefore, Paul has $33 left."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul had 108 pages of notes and he wrote 55 words per page. So, in total, he wrote 55 x 108 = 5740 words. Now, if we subtract the number of words he wrote before the exam (59) from the total number of words he wrote (5740), we get: 5740 - 59 = 5681 words. Therefore, the number of words Paul wrote in his notes during the exam is 5681.
Response:  We know that Paul had 51 pages of notes and wrote 106 words per page. After compressing the text using a word processor, he ended up with 82 pages and 14 words per page. To find out how many words were lost during compression, we need to subtract the number of words per page before compression from the number of words per page after compression:  14 - 106 = 92 words lost During compression, Paul lost 92 words.
Response:  If Paul has 136 pages of notes and he wants to remove 27 pages, how many pages will be left after removing those 27 pages?   To find out, we can subtract 27 from 136:  136 - 27 =?  The result is:  109 pages will be left after removing 27 pages.
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 friends and he gave 39 books to his friend. So, how many books did Paul have left after giving 39 books away? To find out, we can subtract 39 from 134: 134 - 39 = 95. Therefore, Paul had 95 books left after giving 39 books away.
Response:  We know that Paul had 95 words in his text and he removed 153 words. So, if we subtract 153 from 95, we get:  95 - 153 = -58  Therefore, Paul had 58 words left after removing 153 words from his original text.
Response:  We know that Paul had 42 words in his text and he used 143 words to describe it. So, we can start by subtracting 143 from 42 to find out how many words were added to the original text.  143 - 42 =?  The difference between 143 and 42 is 101. Therefore, Paul added 101 words to the original text.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 8 apples in her basket and she gave 2 to her friend, so now she has  8 - 2 = 6 apples left in her basket. Secondly, we are asked if the remaining apples in Jessica's basket are enough for all of them to share equally, so we need to divide the number of apples Jessica has left by the number of people who want to share them. In this case, there are 10 people who want to share the apples, so we can divide 6 (the number of apples Jessica has left) by 10:  6 √∑ 10 = 0 remainder 4 So, each person will get 4 apples if they share equally among themselves. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Jessica had 16 birds in her farm and she sold 7 to the market. So, how many birds does Jessica have now?  7 + 16 = 23 birds. Therefore, Jessica has 23 birds in her farm now.
Response: 1. Jessica had 4 eggs in her basket. 2. She gave 2 eggs to her friend, leaving her with 4 - 2 = 2 eggs. 3. Now she has 2 eggs left. So, the number of eggs Jessica has is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 15 marbles in her bag initially. Then she gave 33 marbles to her friend and took back only 17 marbles from her friend's bag. So, if JESSICA GAVE 33 MARBLES TO HER FRIEND AND TOOK BACK ONLY 17 MARBLES, THEN THE DIFFERENCE IS =  33 - 17 = 16 Marbles. Therefore, Jessica has 16 more marbles than before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 21 marbles in her bag and she gave 34 to her friend who had 15 marbles already. So, how many more marbles did Jessica give to her friend?   To find out, we can subtract the number of marbles her friend already had (15) from the total number of marbles Jessica had (21):  21 - 15 = 6   Therefore, Jessica gave 6 more marbles to her friend.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many more cows Jessica has than before. We know that she had 59 cows and now she has 20 more cows, so we can calculate as follows:  59 + 20 = 79 So Jessica has 79 cows in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 13 marbles in her bag and she gave 2 to her friend, so now she has 13 - 2 = 11 marbles left.   Secondly, we are told that there is a new bag of marbles with 21 marbles, and we want to know if it fits into Jessica's bag. To do this, we need to compare the number of marbles in the new bag (21) with the number of marbles left in Jessica's bag (11). Since 21 is greater than 11, the new bag of marbles does not fit into Jessica's bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 15 waridi and 62 orkidi in her garden. Now, she has 17 waridi and 96 orkidi. So, to find out how many more waridi and orkidi she has now than before, we need to subtract the original numbers from the new ones.   Waridi: 17 - 15 = 2 More waridi. Orkidi: 96 - 62 = 34 More orkidi. Therefore, Jessica has 2 more waridi and 34 more orkidi in her garden now than she did before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 12 waridi and 2 orkidi in the garden.  Secondly, Jessica added more waridi and orkidi to her garden from outside sources. Finally, currently, there are 10 waridi and 21 orkidi in the garden. To find out how many orkidi Jessica added, let's subtract the initial number of orkidi (2) from the current number of orkidi (21):  21 - 2 = 19 Therefore, Jessica added 19 orkidi to her garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 waridi and 2 orkidi in total. Secondly, we know that Jessica has more than 5 waridi and less than 3 orkidi. So let's start with the number of waridi she has.  5 + x = 12 (where x is the number of waridi Jessica has)  Now, let's solve for x.  We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.  12 - 5 = x - 5  7 = x  Therefore, Jessica has 7 waridi.  Next, we need to find out how many orkidi she has. Since she has fewer orkidi than waridi, we can use the remaining numbers to find out how many orkidi she has.  Let's use the same method as before.  3 - x = 2 (where x is the number of orkidi Jessica has)  Now, let's solve for x.  Again, we can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.  3 - x = 2 - 3  0 = x  Therefore, Jessica has no orkidi.  To summarize, Jessica has 7 waridi but no orkidi.
Response:  We know that Jessica had 7 warids and 12 orchids in her basket. Now she has 11 warids and 20 orchids. So we can start by comparing the number of warids she had before and after. Before, she had 7 warids, and now she has 11 warids, so the difference is:  11 - 7 = 4 more warids. Next, let's compare the number of orchids she had before and after: Before, she had 12 orchids, and now she has 20 orchids, so the difference is:  20 - 12 = 8 more orchids. Therefore, Jessica has 4 more warids and 8 more orchids than before.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that there are 19 waridi in total.  
Secondly, if there were 3 waridi less, then there would be 16 waridi left (19 - 3 = 16). 
So, to find out how many waridi Jessica has, we need to subtract 3 from 19: 19 - 3 = 16.  Therefore, Jessica has 16 waridi."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 13 warids and 84 orchids in her garden. Now, she has 91 orchids and 14 warids. So, to find out how many more orchids Jessica has now than before, we subtract 84 from 91:  91 - 84 = 7. Therefore, Jessica has 7 more orchids now than before. Similarly, to find out how many fewer warids Jessica has now than before, we subtract 13 from 14:  14 - 13 = 1. Thus, Jessica has one fewer warid now than before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 16 waridi and 3 orkidi in her garden. Secondly, she gave some of her waridi to her friends, leaving her with 7 waridi and 13 orkidi. So, if we subtract the number of waridi she gave away (7) from the total number of waridi she had initially (16), we get:  16 - 7 = 9. Therefore, Jessica has 9 waridi left in her garden. Similarly, if we subtract the number of orkidi she gave away (13) from the total number of orkidi she had initially (3), we get:  3 - 13 = -10. This means that Jessica does not have any orkidi left in her garden.
Response:  We know that Jessica has 6 warids and 20 orchids in her garden. If she added 2 more warids (21 and 22) and no orchids, then we can conclude that the number of orchids is still 20. Therefore, the answer is:  20.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 9 waridi and 6 orkidi in her garden. Secondly, she added more orkidi to her garden, making it 13 orkidi in total. Lastly, there are 3 waridi left in her garden. So, if we subtract the number of waridi from the total number of orkidi, we get:  13 - 3 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 orkidi more than waridi in Jessica's garden now.
Response:  If Robin is currently 13 years old and will be 17 years old in 4 years, we can calculate her current age as follows:  17 - 4 = 13 Current Age of Robin Now, if Robin is 13 years old now, then she was born when she was one year old. Therefore, the answer to the second part of the question is:  1 + 13 = 14 Years Old When Robin Was Born
Response:  If Robin has 20 apples and gives 10 to his friend, then he has 20 - 10 = 10 apples left.   So, if his friend wants 5 more apples, Robin will give him all the remaining apples (10) because there is no other apple left for him to give. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Robin had $16 and spent $11, then he has $5 left ($16 - $11 = $5).   Therefore, his current balance is $5.
Response:  If Robin is 19 years old and his sister is 18 years old, then their age difference is:  19 - 18 = 1 year.  Therefore, if Robin is currently 19 years old, his sister will be 18 years old.
Response:  If Robin has 13 apples and gives 1 to each of her friends, how many apples will she have left?   We know that if Robin gives one apple to each of her 13 friends, then she will have no apples left because she gave all of them away. So, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Robin had $14 and spent $8. So he has $6 left ($14 - $8 = $6). Now we are asked if he has enough money to buy an item worth $20. Can he afford it?   Yes, he can! Because $6 is greater than or equal to $20.
Response:  If Danny has 12 coins in his pocket and he spent 53 coins in total, then we can find out how many coins he has left by subtracting 53 from 12.  12 - 53 =?  Yes, that's right! Danny has 7 coins left in his pocket.
Response:  If Danny is 21 years old and has been in prison for 53 days, how many days will he spend in prison altogether?   To find out, we need to add 53 days to his current age. So, if Danny is currently 21 years old and spends 53 more days in prison, his total age will be:  21 + 53 = 74 years old.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $63 in his savings account at some point in time (51 weeks ago). Secondly, he spent $33 recently, leaving him with only $30 currently. So, to find out how much money Danny lost, we need to subtract what he spent ($33) from what he had before ($63):  
Lost = $63 - $33 Lost = $30  Therefore, Danny lost $30."
Response: 1) We know that Danny had $36 in his pocket at the beginning of the trip and spent $35 during the trip. So he has $36 - $35 = $1 left.  2) Now we are told that after spending money for food, Danny has $22 left. So we can set up the equation: $1 + $22 = $23 (since he has $23 left).  3) Solving for $1, we get: $1 = $23 - $22 = $1. Therefore, Danny spent $1 more than he should have on food.
Response: 1) The person was born when they were 30 years old and have been alive for 63 years now.  2) They are currently 42 years old. 3) To find out how many more years they will live, we need to subtract their current age from their total lifespan (63 - 42 = 21). So, they will likely live for another 21 years.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $22 to spend and he spent $8 on a toy. So, how much did he have left?  
$22 - $8 = $14  Therefore, Danny had $14 left after buying the toy. Now, let's look at the next information given in the problem:  He spent $63 on a new bike. How much of this amount was covered by the money he had left?  We can calculate this as follows: 
$63 - $14 = $50  So, Danny used all his remaining money ($14) to buy the new bike."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $22 to spend and he spent $30 on video games. So, how much did he spend in total? Total amount = $22 + $30 = $52. Now, we are told that Danny has $17 left after spending $57 on video games. Therefore, we can calculate how much he spent as follows: Amount spent = Total amount - Remaining amount Amount spent = $52 - $17 = $35.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $30 and spent $14 on a trip to the city. This means he has $30 - $14 = $16 left.   Secondly, we are told that Danny now has $7 and spends $86 on something else. So, he has $7 - $86 = -$79 left.  Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Danny had in the village and what he spent in the city is:   $16 - (-$79) = $95.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has $11 in his wallet and he spent $28 on something. So, how much does he have left? We can calculate this by subtracting $28 from $11:  
$11 - $28 =?  Now, we are told that Danny has $68 in his wallet and he spent $51 on something else. So, how much does he have left now? We can calculate this by subtracting $51 from $68:  
$68 - $51 =?  Finally, we want to find out how much more money Danny has now compared to when he had $11 in his wallet. To do this, we will subtract the amount he had before ($11) from the amount he has now ($68):  
$68 - $11 =?  Based on these calculations, here is the numeric answer:  
$68 - $11 = $57  
$57 is the difference between the amount of money Danny has now and the amount he had when he spent $28."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $71 and spent $24 on something. So he has $71 - $24 = $47 left.   Secondly, we know that Danny now has $47 and spends $16 on another thing. So he has $47 - $16 = $31 left. Therefore, Danny has $31 more than what he had before he spent $24.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $10 and spent $62 in total. So he has spent $62 - $10 = $52. Now, he has $52 left.   Secondly, we know that Danny currently has $27 and spends $43. So he has spent $43 - $27 = $16. Therefore, he has $52 - $16 = $36 left. Finally, we can say that Danny has $36 left after both transactions.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $66 in his pocket before he spent any money. Secondly, we are told that he spent $25 on something. So, how much does Danny have left after spending $25? To find out, we can subtract $25 from $66:  
$66 - $25 =?  The result is: $41. Therefore, Danny has $41 left after spending $25."
Response:  If Danny had 25 beans in his first basket and he added 32 more beans to it, then he has a total of  25 + 32 = 57 beans in his second basket.
Response: 1) Danny had $58 for 60 days, so he had $58 x 2 = $116 for 60 days.  2) After 60 days, he had $116 + ($116 x 8%) = $116 + $9.32 = $125.32.  3) Now, after another 7 days, he had $125.32 + ($125.32 x 8%) = $125.32 + $9.82 = $135.14. So, Danny currently has $135.14 in his savings account.
Response: 1) The child was crying for 6 hours in the forest. 2) After that, he slept for 50 minutes. 3) Now he is sleeping again and has been asleep for 60 minutes. To find out how much longer he will sleep, we need to subtract the time he has already slept from the total amount of time he spent crying plus the time he slept earlier. Total time = 6 hours + 50 minutes = 9 hours So, he will sleep for 9 - 60 = 3 hours more.
Response: 1. The difference between Vikolezo Vya Zamani and Vikolezo Vya Chupa is 4 years (54 - 48 = 4).  2. Now, we know that Danny is currently 52 years old. So, if we subtract his current age from the difference, we get: 52 - 4 = 48 years old when he was in college.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny had $82 in his savings account and spent $29 on something. So, he has $82 - $29 = $53 left in his account.   Next, we are told that Danny now has $42 in his savings account and wants to know if he has enough money to buy something that costs $61. To determine this, we need to compare $42 to $61. Is $42 greater than or equal to $61? Since $42 is less than $61, Danny does not have enough money to buy what he wants.

"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has $46 in his savings account and he wants to buy a bike that costs $50. So, he needs to save more money. Secondly, we are given that Danny now has $21 in his savings account and he wants to buy the same bike that cost $50. Therefore, he still needs to save more money. Now, let's calculate how much more he needs to save: Amount needed = Cost of bike - Amount saved  
Amount needed = $50 - $21 = $29  So, Danny needs to save an additional $29 to buy the bike."
Response:  We know that Danny has 65 marbles in total and he gave 5 to his friend. So, he has 60 marbles left (65 - 5 = 60). Now, we are told that Danny has 31 marbles in his pocket and there are 9 marbles in the bag. Therefore, the number of marbles Danny has other than those in his pocket is:  60 - 31 = 29.  Since Danny has 29 marbles other than those in his pocket, he must have given 29 + 31 = 60 marbles to his friend.  So, the correct answer is:  60.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has $58 and he spent $25 on something in the store. So, how much does he have left?  
$58 - $25 = $33 
Danny has $33 left. Now, he wants to buy a new toy that costs $12. How much more does he need to pay? 
$12 - $33 = $21 
Danny needs to pay $21 more to buy the new toy."
Response:  We know that Danny has $15 in his wallet and spends $18 on toys. So he has $15 - $18 = -$3 less than before. Now he has $35 - $3 = $32 left. Therefore, Danny has $32 more than before.
Response:  If Jake is 11 years old and Steven is 17 years old, then:  17 - 11 = 6  So, Steven is 6 years older than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 more than Steven, and Steven has 14 more than Jill. So we can start with these two equations:  7 + S = 14... (1)  14 + J = 15... (2) Now we need to find out what ""S"" is. To do this, we can substitute equation (1) into equation (2):  14 + J = 15 7 + S = 14 Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:  7 + S = 7 J = 8 S = 7 Therefore, Jake has 8 more than Steven, who has 15 - 8 = 7 more than Jill."
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 18 candies and gives 13 to Steven. So, Jake has  18 - 13 = 5 candies left. Next, we know that Steven has 19 candies in total (the 13 he received from Jake + the 6 he already had). Therefore, Jill has  19 - 13 = 6 candies.
Response: 1st, we know that Jake has 3 more than Steven who has 8 - 3 = 5. So Jake has 5.  2nd, We know that Jill has 8 more than Steven who has 5 + 8 = 13. Therefore, Jill has 13.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 marbles and Steven has 11 more than Jake. So, if we subtract 11 from 12, we get:  12 - 11 = 1 Therefore, Jake has 1 more marble than Steven. Now, let's find out how many marbles Jill has. The problem states that Jill has 4 more marbles than Jake. So, if we add 4 to 1, we get:  1 + 4 = 5 Therefore, Jill has 5 marbles in total.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 more than Steven, and Steven has 16. So we can start with the equation:  7 + S = 16 Where ""S"" is the number of points Steven has. Solving for S, we get:  7 + S = 16 S = 9 Now we know that Steven has 9 points. Since Jake has 7 more than Steven, we can find out how many points Jake has by adding 7 to what Steven has:  9 + 7 = 16 Jake has 16 points."
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 apples and gives 3 to Steven, so now Steven has 7 + 3 = 10 apples.   Next, we know that Jill has 8 apples and gives 2 to Steven, so now Steven has 10 + 2 = 12 apples. Therefore, Jill has 8 - 2 = 6 apples left.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 9 apples and gives 3 to Steven. Therefore, Steven has 9 - 3 = 6 apples. Now, Jill gives 2 apples to Steven, so Steven has 6 + 2 = 8 apples. Finally, Jill takes 2 apples from Steven, leaving him with 8 - 2 = 6 apples. So, Jill has taken 2 apples from Steven.  
Therefore, the correct answer is 6."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has six more candies than Steven. So if Steven has candy, Jake has +6 = 18 candies. Secondly, we know that Jill has five fewer candies than Steven. Therefore, if Steven has candies, Jill has -5 = candies. Now, we can find out how many candies Jake has by adding the number of candies Jill has to the number of candies Steven has: Jake has = +6 + = candies.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 5 more than Steven. So if Steven has x, then Jake has x + 5.   Next, we know that Jill has 18 more than Steven. So if Steven has x, then Jill has x + 18. Finally, we are told that Jill has 87. So we can set up the equation: x + (x + 5) + 18 = 87. Combine like terms: 2x + 13 = 87. Subtract 13 from both sides: 2x = 74. Divide both sides by 2: x = 37. Therefore, Jake has 37 and Jill has 37 + 18 = 55.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 16 candies and Steven has 15 candies. So, if we add both amounts together, we get:  16 + 15 = 31 candies in total. Next, we are told that Jill has 12 candies. If we subtract the amount of candies Jill has from the total amount of candies, we get:  31 - 12 = 19 candies left over. Therefore, Jill has more candies than Jake.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 12 kids and 79 grandchildren.   Secondly, we know that Steven has 19 kids and 14 grandchildren. Thirdly, we need to find out how many children Jake has more than Steven. To do this, subtract the number of kids Steven has from the number of kids Jake has:  12 - 19 = -7  Since Jake has fewer kids than Steven, the answer is negative seven ( -7).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 13 marbles and he gives 3 to Steven. Therefore, Jake will have  13 - 3 = 10 marbles left.  Secondly, we know that Steven has 9 marbles and he gets 8 more from Jake. So, Steven will have  9 + 8 = 17 marbles now.  Finally, we need to find out how many marbles Jake has after giving all his marbles to Steven. We can do this by subtracting the number of marbles Steven has (17) from the number of marbles Jake has (10).  Jake has  10 - 17 = -7 marbles left.  There is no integer value for negative numbers, so there is no answer in whole numbers.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 6 kids and his wife is pregnant with their 8th child. So, Jake has 6 + 8 = 14 children in total.   Secondly, we know that Steven has 17 children and his wife is also pregnant with their 16th child. So, Steven has 17 + 16 = 33 children in total.  Therefore, to determine who has more children, we need to compare 14 and 33. It looks like Steven has more children than Jake!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 3 kids and each of them has 10 toys. Therefore, in total, Jake has 3 x 10 = 30 toys.   Secondly, we know that Steven has 12 kids and each of them has 15 toys. Therefore, in total, Steven has 12 x 15 = 180 toys. Finally, we need to find out how many more toys does Steven have compared to Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of toys Jake has from the number of toys Steven has: 180 - 30 = 150. So, Steven has 150 more toys than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 12 marbles and Jake has 4 times as many marbles as Steven. So, if we let x be the number of marbles Jake has, then Jake has 4x marbles in total.  
We also know that Jake has more than half of Steven's marbles (67 out of 12). Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
4x > 67  
Now, divide both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:  
x > 16  
So, Jake has at least 16 marbles."
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 marbles and gives 8 to Jill. So, how many marbles does Steven have left?  18 - 8 = 10  Now we know that Steven has 10 marbles left. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Jill has. Since Jake gave her 8 marbles, she now has 8 + 10 = 18 marbles. Therefore, Jill has 18 marbles.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 marbles and Jake has  12 fewer marbles than Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from 19, we get:  19 - 12 = 7 Therefore, Jake has 7 marbles.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 marbles and Jake has 6 more than Steven. So, Jake has  14 + 6 = 20 marbles.  Now we are told that Jill has 3 more than Jake. Therefore, Jill has  20 + 3 = 23 marbles.  So, Jill has 23 marbles.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 84 - 10 = 74 more marbles than Steven.   Second, we know that Steven has 13 more marbles than he had before (he gained 13). So, Steven now has 52 + 13 = 65 marbles in total.  Therefore, Jake has 74 + 65 = 139 marbles in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 13 marbles and Steven has 8 marbles. So, if they play together, how many marbles will each of them have after playing?   To find out, let's add the number of marbles they both have:  13 + 8 = 21   Therefore, after playing together, Jake will have 21 - 13 = 8 marbles left, and Steven will have 21 - 8 = 13 marbles left.  Now, the second part of the question asks us to determine which one of them has more marbles. We can compare their remaining marbles:  13 > 8   Therefore, Steven has more marbles than Jake.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 8 kids and each of his kids has 10 toys. So, in total, Jake has  8 x 10 = 80 toys. Now, let's look at Steven. He has 11 kids and each of his kids has 18 toys. So, in total, Steven has 11 x 18 = 198 toys. Therefore, Steven has more toys than Jake.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has three kids and four grandchildren. So, Jake's total number of descendants is 3 + 4 = 7.   Next, we know that Steven has 19 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. So, Steven's total number of descendants is 19 + 15 = 34.  Finally, we are asked to find out how many more great-grandchildren Steven has than Jake. To do this, we can subtract Jake's total number of descendants (7) from Steven's total number of descendants (34):  34 - 7 = 27.  Therefore, Steven has 27 more great-grandchildren than Jake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kulikuwa had $78 in her account at Olivia's bank. Secondly, she withdrew $15 from the ATM. So, how much money does Kulikuwa have left in her account now? To find out, we need to subtract the amount she withdrew ($15) from the initial amount she had ($78). Here's the calculation: $78 - $15 =? The result is: $63. Therefore, Kulikuwa has $63 left in her account after withdrawing $15 from the ATM.
Response: 1) First, we know that Olivia had $78 in her account before she withdrew $33. So, what is the amount of money left in her account after withdrawing $33?  2) To find out how much money is left in Olivia's account, we need to subtract the amount she withdrew ($33) from the original amount she had ($78). Here's the calculation: $78 - $33 =?  Can you solve for the missing number and tell me the result?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there was an initial amount of money in the account which is $100 (Kulikuwa na dola 100). Secondly, we are given that after withdrawing from the ATM, the balance became $148 less ($159 - $148 = $11). Thirdly, we are told that after deducting some amount from the new balance, the remaining balance became $159. So, let's find out what amount was deducted to reach this balance. We can do this by subtracting the previous balance ($148) from the new balance ($159):  $159 - $148 = $11  Therefore, the amount deducted from the new balance of $159 is $11.   Now, let's calculate the original amount that was withdrawn from the ATM:  We know that the amount withdrawn was $11 more than the previous balance ($148), so we can calculate it as follows:  $148 + $11 = $159  Thus, the amount withdrawn from the ATM was $159.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia had $49 in her account before withdrawing money from the ATM. After withdrawing money, she was left with $0. So, the amount of money Olivia spent at the ATM is equal to the amount of money she had in her account before withdrawal, which is $49. Therefore, the answer is $49.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia had Sh. 53 in her account before withdrawing money from an ATM. Secondly, she withdrew Sh. 91 from the ATM. Lastly, after deducting the amount she withdrew from her account balance, she was left with Sh. 14. Therefore, to find out how much more money Olivia withdrew from the ATM than what she actually needed, we can subtract the remaining balance (Sh. 14) from the amount she withdrew (Sh. 91). This gives us:  

Sh. 91 - Sh. 14 = Sh. 77  So, Olivia withdrew Sh. 77 more from the ATM than what she actually needed."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her savings account and she withdrew $49 from the ATM. So, how much money does Olivia have left in her savings account?   To find out, we need to subtract the amount she withdrew ($49) from the original amount she had ($106):   $106 - $49 =?  The answer is:   $106 - $49 = $57  Therefore, Olivia has $57 left in her savings account after withdrawing $49 from the ATM.
"Response:  If Olivia had $29 and spent half of it, then she would have $29/2 = $14.50 left.  
If she then spent another $36, she would be left with $14.50 + $36 = $50.50."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia has $38 in her pocket and she wants to buy something that costs $128. So, she needs more money.   Secondly, if she had $128, she would have enough money to buy what she wants. Therefore, we can say that Olivia needs $128 - $38 = $90 more to buy what she wants.
Response:  If Dave had 19 programs on his computer and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 programs left on his computer.   So, the correct answer is 14.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had $18 in his account before he withdrew $5. So, what was the balance left in his account after withdrawing $5? To find out, we need to subtract the amount withdrawn ($5) from the initial balance ($18):   $18 - $5 = $13  Therefore, the balance left in Dave's account after withdrawing $5 is $13.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 10 programs on his phone. Secondly, he downloaded one more program, making it 11 in total. Thirdly, after some time, four programs were removed from his phone. So, if four programs were removed, how many programs are left on Dave's phone now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of removed programs (4) from the total number of programs (11). Therefore, the answer is:  11 - 4 = 7. So, there are seven programs left on Dave's phone.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 21 programs on his computer and he deleted one of them (program 89). So, after deleting program 89, Dave had 20 programs left on his computer.   Secondly, we are told that after some time, Dave found out that there was another program (program 24) installed on his computer without his knowledge. Therefore, the total number of programs Dave had on his computer at this point is 20 + 1 = 21 programs.  Finally, we are asked to find out how many more programs Dave had than before he deleted program 89. To do this, we need to subtract the original number of programs (21) from the new total number of programs (21 + 1) : 21 - 21 = 0. This means that Dave did not have any more programs than before he deleted program 89.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 15 programs in his computer and he deleted one of them (program 71). So, after deleting program 71, Dave was left with 14 programs. Now, if we subtract the number of programs Dave had before deleting any (14) from the total number of programs he had (15), we get:  15 - 14 = 1 Therefore, Dave deleted one more program than he had before.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 16 points in the first program and failed 77 questions. This means he scored 77 - 16 = 61 points in the first program.   Next, we know that Dave scored 5 points in the second program and failed 23 questions. This means he scored 23 - 5 = 18 points in the second program. Finally, we want to find out how many points Dave scored in total. To do this, we add his scores from both programs: 61 + 18 = 79 points. Therefore, Dave scored 79 points in total.
Response:  First, we know that Dave watched 17 programs and failed 21 times in total. This means he failed more than he succeeded.  Secondly, we are given that after watching 3 programs, he had failed 7 times. So, how many programs did he watch before failing 7 times? To find out, let's use subtraction.  3 - 7 = -4  Since the result of this calculation is negative, it means that Dave watched fewer programs before failing 7 times than the number of programs he failed. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 programs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 15 programs in his computer and each program took up 24 KB of space. So, the total amount of space used by all the programs was:  15 x 24 = 360 KB Now, we are told that after removing some programs, Dave had only 21 programs left, and each program still takes up 24 KB of space. Therefore, the new total amount of space used by all the remaining programs is:  21 x 24 = 484 KB To find out how much more space is being used by the remaining programs compared to the original set of programs, we need to subtract the old total from the new total:  484 - 360 = 124 KB So, there is an additional 124 KB of space being used by the remaining programs compared to the original set of programs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 19 points in total before he failed 18 questions. So, his remaining score after failing 18 questions is:  19 - 18 = 1 point. Now, we are told that he scored 6 points for answering 6 questions correctly and 15 points for answering 15 questions correctly. Therefore, his final score can be calculated as follows:  1 + 6 + 15 = 22 points.  So, the difference between the number of points earned by Dave and the number of points required to pass the exam is:  22 - 18 = 4 points.
Response:  If Dave had 17 coins in his pocket and then gained 3 more coins, he would have a total of 17 + 3 = 20 coins. So, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 59 points in his program and he scored 12 points less than half of his total score. So, if he scored 12 points less than half of his total score, then he must have scored (1/2) x 59 = 29.5 points.  Now, we are told that Dave also scored 30 points in another program. Therefore, the total number of points Dave scored is 29.5 + 30 = 59.5 points.  
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 24 programs in his phone and he deleted 13 of them. So, how many programs are left?  24 - 13 = 11 programs are left. Now, we know that Dave also downloaded 8 new programs. So, the total number of programs he has now is: 11 + 8 = 19 programs. Finally, we need to find out which program was the last one he downloaded. Since he downloaded 8 new programs, the last program he downloaded must be the 8th one. Therefore, the answer is: Faili 21 (the 8th program).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 24 hours in his day and he spent 9 hours watching TV. This means he has 15 hours left (24 - 9 = 15).   Secondly, we are given that he spent 5 hours playing video games and 12 hours sleeping. Therefore, the total amount of time he spent on these activities is 5 + 12 = 17 hours. Now, let's check if there is any time left for other activities. We can do this by subtracting the total amount of time he spent on activities from the remaining hours he had in his day. In this case, we have:  15 - 17 = -2 hours. This means that Dave did not have enough time to engage in any other activities besides watching TV, playing video games, and sleeping.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 11 programs and 3 fails in his simulation. After the failure of some of the programs, he was left with 24 programs and 2 fails. Now, we need to find out how many more fails than programs were left in the simulation. To do this, we can subtract the number of programs from the total number of fails. So, if we subtract 24 (programs) from 3 (fails), we get:  24 - 3 = 21 Therefore, there are 21 more fails than programs left in the simulation.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff has 136 cards and Nell has 242 cards. So, if we subtract Jeff's cards from Nell's cards, we get:  

242 - 136 = 106  Therefore, Nell has 106 more cards than Jeff."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff had 301 points and now he has 154 points. So, he lost 147 points (301 - 154).   Secondly, we are asked if Nell had any points. Since Jeff lost all his points, it means that Nell did not have any points to begin with. Therefore, the answer is 0 points for Nell.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff had card number 11 and now he has card number 252. So, the difference between his current card number (252) and his previous card number (11) is:  252 - 11 = 241. Therefore, Jeff lost 241 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff had card number 234 at some point in time.  Secondly, he currently has card number 535. Lastly, we are asked to determine what card number Jeff has now. To find out, let's subtract the old card number (234) from the current card number (535):  535 - 234 = 301 Therefore, Jeff currently has card number 301.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff had Ksh. 309 in his account and he withdrew Ksh. 10,356. So, the amount left in his account is:  309 - 10,356 = -10,047  Next, we are asked to find out how much more the new account balance is compared to the old one. To do this, we need to subtract the old balance from the new balance:  415 - 10,149 = -9,734  Therefore, the new account balance (Ksh. 415) is Ksh. 9,734 less than the old balance (Ksh. 10,149).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff had Ksh. 246 in his account and he withdrew Ksh. 10,214 leaving him with Ksh. 404. Now, if he has Ksh. 404, what is the difference between this amount and the initial amount of Ksh. 246?   To find the difference, subtract Ksh. 246 from Ksh. 404:   Ksh. 404 - Ksh. 246 = Ksh. 158 So, the difference between the two amounts is Ksh. 158.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell had 573 cards and she gave some to John who had 195 cards. So, if we subtract 195 from 573, we get:  573 - 195 = 378 Now, we are told that Nell has 210 cards left. Therefore, if we add 210 to 378, we get:  378 + 210 = 588 Thus, the number of cards that Nell gave to Jeff is 588.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff has Ksh. 55 and he spent Ksh. 10 on something, so he has Ksh.  45 left (55 - 10 = 45).  Secondly, we know that he spent Ksh. 178 on another thing, so now he has Ksh.  22 less than Ksh.  45 (45 - 22 = 23)  Therefore, Jeff has Ksh.  23 left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jeff has Ksh. 10,376 and he spent Ksh. 111 on something. So, what is the remaining amount of money that Jeff has?   To find out, we can subtract Ksh. 111 from Ksh. 10,376.  10,376 - 111 =?   The answer is Ksh. 10,265. Therefore, Jeff has Ksh. 10,265 left after spending Ksh. 111.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 19 cows and he sold 35 cows. So, if we subtract 19 from 35, we get:  35 - 19 = 16. Therefore, Paco has 16 cows left after selling 35 cows.
Response:  We know that Paco had 28 cookies and he ate 7 of them. So, how many cookies does Paco have left? To find out, we can subtract the number of cookies eaten (7) from the total number of cookies (28):  28 - 7 =?  The answer is: 21. Therefore, Paco has 21 cookies left.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 40 mangoes and gave away 2 to his friend. So he has 40 - 2 = 38 mangoes left.   Secondly, we are asked if Paco would have enough mangoes if he gives away another 37 mangoes. To determine this, we need to check if 38 (the number of mangoes Paco has) is greater than or equal to 37 (the number of mangoes he wants to give away).   Since 38 is greater than 37, the answer is yes; Paco would have enough mangoes if he gives away another 37."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 25 cats and he gave away 5 of them. So, how many cats does Paco have left?  25 - 5 =?  20  Therefore, Paco has 20 cats left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 13 cats and he gave away 2 of them. So, how many cats does Paco have left?  13 - 2 = 11   Now, if Paco wants to have as many cats as possible without exceeding 36, how many more cats can he adopt?  36 - 11 = 25   Therefore, Paco can adopt 25 more cats.
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 cookies and gave 5 to his friend. So, how many cookies does Paco have left?   To find out, we can subtract the number of cookies given to the friend from the total number of cookies Paco had:  40 - 5 =?  Can you solve for the missing number?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had $17 and he spent $14 on his friend's birthday party. So, how much money is left with Paco now?   To find out, we subtract $14 from $17:   $17 - $14 =?  Yes, you are right! There is $3 left with Paco after spending $14 on his friend's birthday party.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 12 friends and he made new friends at his new school, so now he has 16 friends in total. Next, we are told that one of his old friends from his previous school, Ali, is not among his new friends. So, if we subtract the number of old friends (1) from the total number of friends (16), we get the number of new friends Paco has (16 - 1 = 15). Therefore, Paco has 15 new friends at his new school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 22 cookies and gave 15 to his friend. So, he has  22 - 15 = 7 cookies left. Secondly, we know that his friend received 15 cookies and already ate 54 - 15 = 39 cookies. Therefore, his friend has 39 cookies left. Finally, we need to find out how many cookies Paco ate. Since he has 7 cookies left, he must have eaten 7 cookies.  So, the answer is 7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 9 cookies and gave 6 to his friend. So, he has 9 - 6 = 3 cookies left. Secondly, we are given that he ate 3 more cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by Paco is 3 + 3 = 6 cookies. Finally, we need to find out how many cookies were left after Paco finished eating them. So, the answer is:  3 (cookies left after Paco finished eating).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 37 cookies and he gave 11 to his friend. So, how many cookies does Paco have left?  37 - 11 = 26  Therefore, Paco has 26 cookies left. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We are asked to find out how many more cookies Paco has than his friend. To do this, we need to compare the number of cookies Paco has with the number of cookies his friend has. Based on the information given, Paco's friend has 2 cookies. So, we can say that Paco has more cookies than his friend by:  26 - 2 = 24  Therefore, Paco has 24 more cookies than his friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 8 cookies and gave 6 to his friend. So, he has 8 - 6 = 2 left. Now, if he wants to give 20 cookies to his friend, he will have none left for himself. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco has and the number of cookies his friend has is:  20 - 2 = 18.
Response:  If Paco had  37 marbles and lost one, he would have  36 marbles left. So, if Paco has  36 marbles now, it means that he lost one marble. Therefore, the missing marble is number 37.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has  36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Now, his friend thought that Paco had 10 cookies but actually, Paco had 22 cookies. Therefore, the difference between the actual number of cookies Paco had and what his friend thought is:  22 - 10 = 12 cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So, he has  41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Now, if his friend ate 18 more cookies, then Paco would have  32 - 18 = 14 cookies left. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco has and the number of cookies his friend ate is:  14 - 18 = -4.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had $6. Second, his friend took $30 and thought he gave back $23. So, what is the difference between what his friend gave him and what he thought he gave him?   Difference = $30 - $23 = $7. Therefore, Paco gained $7 from his friend.
Response:  We know that Paco had 97 cookies and gave 34 to his friend Tamu. So, he has  97 - 34 = 63 cookies left.  Now, we are told that Tamu ate 15 of Paco's cookies, so Paco has  63 - 15 = 48 cookies left.  Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco has left is 48.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 26 cookies and gave some to Tammy. So, if he gave her 17 cookies, how many does he have left?  26 - 17 = 9  Therefore, Paco has 9 cookies left. Now, let's find out how many cookies Tammy has. We know she received 14 cookies from Paco, so she has 14 cookies in total. Finally, we need to determine how many cookies Tammy gave back to Paco. According to the problem, she gave him 9 cookies. So, Tammy gave 9 cookies back to Paco.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 39 cookies and gave some to his friends as follows: 23 cookies (chumvi) and 32 cookies (tamu). So, he has remaining cookies as follows:  39 - 23 = 16 cookies (chumvi) + 32 = 48 cookies (tamu) Therefore, Paco has more tamu cookies than chumvi cookies by 48 - 16 = 32 cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco had 40 cookies and gave some to his friends as follows: 25 cookies (chumvi) and 15 cookies (tamu). So, he has remaining cookies as follows:  28 - 25 = 3 cookies (chumvi) + 15 - 25 = 0 cookies (tamu) Therefore, Paco has more chumvi cookies than tamu cookies. The difference between the number of chumvi cookies and the number of tamu cookies is 3 - 0 = 3.
Response:  If Gwen has $7 and she spends $5, how much money does she have left?   To find out, we can subtract $5 from $7:   $7 - $5 =?  The answer is: $2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen has $8 and she spends $6. So, how much money does Gwen have left after spending $6?   To find out, we can subtract $6 from $8:   $8 - $6 = $2   Therefore, Gwen has $2 left after spending $6.
"Response: 
1. Gwen has $2 and her mother has $4. 
2. Gwen spends $3.  
So, how much money does Gwen have left after spending $3?  
Answer: Gwen has $2 - $3 = $1 left after spending $3."
Response:  If Gwen has $8 and her mother has $5 more than her, then her mother has $8 + $5 = $13.   Now, if Gwen gives $4 to her mother, she will have $8 - $4 = $4 left.  So, Gwen's mother will have $13 + $4 = $17.
Response:  If Gwen has $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, then she has a total of $3 + $6 = $9.   Now, if she spends $4, she will be left with $9 - $4 = $5.  So, Gwen will have $5 more from her father than from her mother.
Response:  If Gwen has $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, then she has a total of $5 + $7 = $12.   Now, if she spends $4, she will be left with $12 - $4 = $8.  So, Gwen will have $8 more from her mother than from her father.
"Response:  If Gwen has $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, then she has a total of $7.  
If she spends $6, how much money will she have left after paying for the item?  To find out, we need to subtract the amount spent ($6) from the total amount she had ($7): 
$7 - $6 = $1  So, Gwen will have $1 left after buying the item."
Response:  If Josh had 9 marbles and lost 4, he would have  5 marbles left (9 - 4 = 5). So, if he has 4 marbles now, he must have lost all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles and lost 12, he would have  9 marbles left (21 - 12 = 9).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh had 19 marbles in total and he lost 11 of them. So, how many marbles does Josh have left? To find out, we can subtract 11 from 19:  19 - 11 =?  19 - 11 = 8 Therefore, Josh has 8 marbles left.
"Response:  We know that Josh had 4 bags of rice and each bag weighed 20 kg. So he had a total of 4 x 20 = 80 kg of rice.   Now, if he gave 16 people 8 kg of rice each, then he would have given away 16 x 8 = 128 kg of rice. Since he only had 80 kg to begin with, this means he gave away more than he had. Therefore, the correct answer is ""more than 80 kg""."
Response:  If Josh had 7 marbles in his pocket and he lost 2 more, then he would have 7 - 2 = 5 marbles left. So, Josh has 5 marbles left.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles and lost 7, then he has  21 - 7 = 14 marbles left.
Response:  If Josh had 20 marbles and Jack took 2, then Josh would have  20 - 2 = 18 marbles left. So, Josh has 18 marbles now.
"Response: 
1. Josh had 22 marbles in his pocket. 
2. Jack took 20 marbles from Josh.  3. Now, how many marbles does Josh have left? To find out, we subtract the number of marbles taken (20) from the total number of marbles Josh had (22): 22 - 20 = 2. So, Josh has 2 marbles left."
Response:  If Josh was born in 2011 and is currently 19 years old (in 2023), we can calculate his age as follows:  2023 - 2011 = 12 years. Therefore, Josh is currently 19 years old.
Response:  We know that Josh had 22 marbles in total and he lost 5 of them. So, how many marbles does Josh have left?   To find out, we can subtract 5 from 22:  22 - 5 =?   Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the result?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh had 15 marbles in total. He lost 9 marbles and was left with  23 - 9 = 14 marbles. So, Josh had 14 marbles after losing 9 of them.
Response: 1. Josh had 3 apples in total. 2. He gave 5 of them away. So he has 3 - 5 = -2 apples left.  3. But wait! He also got 6 more apples later. So now he has -2 + 6 = 4 apples in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has $20 and he spends $4 on snacks. So, how much does he have left?  
$20 - $4 = $16 
Marco has $16 left. Now, let's find out how much more he needs to buy the toys. We are given that the toys cost $19 each. So, if Marco buys one toy, how much will it cost him? 
$19 - $16 = $3 
Marco needs $3 more to buy one toy. Since he wants to buy three toys, he will need $3 x 3 = $9 more. Therefore, the difference between what Marco has and what he needs to buy all three toys is: 
$19 - $16 - $9 = $4 
So, Marco needs $4 more than what he currently has to buy all three toys."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has $35 in his piggy bank and he wants to buy a toy that costs $13. So, how much money will he have left after buying the toy? To find out, we can subtract the cost of the toy from the amount of money Marco has:  
$35 - $13 = $22  Therefore, Marco will have $22 left after buying the toy."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has $20 in his pocket and he spent $3 on snacks. So, how much money does Marco have left?  
$20 - $3 = $17  Therefore, Marco has $17 left in his pocket."
"Response:  We know that Marco has $8$ dollars and he spends $\$32$ on toys. So we can write an equation:  
$$ 8 + x = 32 $$  where $x$ is the amount of money spent on each toy. Solving for $x$, we get: 
$$ x = 24 $$  Therefore, Marco spends $\$24$ on each toy."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has 24 hours to complete his task and he spent 9 hours doing so. Therefore, the number of hours left for him to finish is:  24 - 9 = 15 hours. Now, let's calculate how many hours each stoveri will take. We are given that one stoveri takes 3 hours. So, if Marco has 15 hours remaining, he can do:  15 / 3 = 5 stoveris.  There fore, the total number of stoveris Marco needs to make is 5.
Response:  We know that Marco has eaten 8 soberis and his father has eaten 36 soberis. So we can start by finding out how many soberis Marco's father has left to eat.  36 - 8 = 28. Therefore, Marco's father has 28 soberis left to eat. Now let's find out how many soberis Marco has left to eat. Marco has eaten 8 soberis, so he has 12 - 8 = 4 soberis left to eat.
Response:  We know that Marco has 22 teeth and his father has 30 teeth. So we can start by finding out how many more teeth Marco's father has than Marco.   To do this, we subtract the number of teeth Marco has from the number of teeth his father has:  30 - 22 = 8  Therefore, Marco's father has 8 more teeth than Marco. Now let's find out how many teeth Marco will have when he is as old as his father. Since Marco is currently 22 years old and his father is 30 years old, we know that Marco will be 8 years older than he is now when he reaches his father's age. This means that Marco will have 22 + 8 = 30 teeth when he is as old as his father.  So the difference between Marco's current number of teeth (22) and his future number of teeth (30) is also 8.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has 15 sober days in total. Secondly, he has 37 sober days altogether. Thirdly, his current streak of sobriety is 15 days long. To find out how many more days Marco needs to reach his longest streak of sobriety (37 days), subtract the number of days in his current streak from the total number of days in his longest streak:  37 - 15 = 22. Therefore, Marco needs 22 more days to reach his longest streak of sobriety.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco has $30 and he spent $17 on something. So, how much does Marco have left?  
To find out, we can subtract $17 from $30:  
$30 - $17 =? 
Can you do this subtraction in your head or on paper?  The result is... $13! That means Marco has $13 left after spending $17."
"Response:  We know that Marco has $10 in his pocket and he spends $26 on toys. So, we can start by subtracting $10 from $26 to find out how much more he needs to buy the toys:  
$26 - $10 = $16  Therefore, Marco needs an additional $16 to buy the toys."
Response:  If Marco has $11 in his pocket and he spends $30 on toys, then he will have $11 - $30 = -$19 left in his pocket.   Therefore, Marco does not have any money left in his pocket after buying the toys.
Response:  We know that there are 10 children in total who were playing outside the church.  3 of them went to the left, and 4 went to the right. That means there are 3 + 4 = 7 children who did not go to the basement.  Now, we need to find out how many children are left in the basement. If 2 children were left in the basement, then there must be 2 - 7 = negative 5 children left in the basement. Negative numbers indicate less than zero, so there are no children left in the basement. Therefore, all 10 children played outside the church, and none of them went to the basement.
"Response: 
1. The first group of children (Watoto 26) were playing in the yard.  
2. Out of this group, 38 children went to the basement. 
3. Now, we need to find out how many children are left in the yard. 
To do this, we subtract the number of children who went to the basement from the total number of children in the first group:  
26 - 38 =? 
Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that there were 41 children in total who went to the beach and 2 of them drowned. So, if we subtract 2 from 41, we get:  
41 - 2 = 39  Therefore, there were 39 children left at the beach after 2 of them drowned."
"Response:  We know that there are 43 children in total and 21 of them were placed in the first building. That means there are  43 - 21 = 22 children left to be placed in the second building. Now we need to find out how many children each building has. To do this, we can divide the number of children left (22) by the number of buildings (2). This gives us:  
22 / 2 = 11 children per building. So, the first building has 21 + 11 = 32 children and the second building has 22 - 11 = 11 children."
Response:  We know that there are 41 children in total and 18 of them have been placed in the orphanage. That means there are  41 - 18 = 23 children who have not been placed in the orphanage yet.  Of these 23 children, we do not know how many will be placed in the orphanage later, but we can assume that some of them might be. So, the number of children who might still be placed in the orphanage is uncertain, but it could be any number between 0 and 23.
Response:  We know that there were initially 21 children in the orphanage.  10 of them left to go to school, leaving 11 behind. Later, 16 more children arrived at the orphanage, bringing the total number of children to 27 (11 + 16). So, the number of children who went to school is 10, and the number of new arrivals is 16.
Response:  We know that there are 63 children in total who have been moved from one orphanage to another. Of these, 14 children were transferred to the new orphanage, and 50 children remained behind. To find out how many more children were left behind than those who were transferred, we can subtract the number of children transferred (14) from the total number of children (63):  63 - 14 = 49. Therefore, 49 children were left behind in the old orphanage.
Response:  We know that there are 68 children in total who have been transferred from one orphanage to another. Of these, 12 children were transferred directly from the first orphanage to the second orphanage without passing through the transit center (Watoto 36). This means that 56 children (68 - 12) passed through the transit center (Watoto 36).   Now, we need to find out how many of these 56 children were boys and how many were girls. We can do this by dividing the number of boys who passed through the transit center by the total number of children who passed through it. So, if x is the number of boys who passed through the transit center, then we can write the equation: x / 56 = y / 68, where y is the number of girls who passed through the transit center. Solving for x, we get: x = 40. Therefore, there were 40 boys who passed through the transit center, and since there were 56 children in total who passed through it, there must have been 16 girls who passed through it as well (since 56 - 40 = 16).
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children in the orphanage and 40 adults (including the director). This means that there were a total of 62 people in the orphanage (22 + 40 = 62).   After some time, two more children arrived at the orphanage, bringing the total number of children to 24 (22 + 2 = 24). Therefore, the number of children who left the orphanage is 22 - 2 = 20.  So, the remaining number of adults in the orphanage would be 40 - 20 = 20.
"Response: 
1st step: We know that 28 children were initially in the orphanage. 
2nd step: 82 new children arrived at the orphanage, bringing the total number of children to 110 (28 + 82).  
3rd step: Later, 30 more children left the orphanage, leaving 80 children behind (110 - 30). 
So, there are 80 children currently living in the orphanage."
"Response:  We know that there are 24 children in total and 8 of them are sleeping inside the house. That means there are  24 - 8 = 16 children outside the house. Now we need to find out how many of these children are crying. The information given is that ""watoto wangapi zaidi waliishuka"" which translates to ""more than half"". So if more than half of the children outside the house are crying, then we can say that at least 9 (half of 16) children are crying. Therefore, our final answer is 9."
"Response:  If we have $51$ cents and we want to make $133$ cents using only coins of $1$, $2$, $5$, and $10$, we can do it as follows:  
First, let's use $5$ coins of $2$ each to get $10$ dollars. We have used $5 \times 2 = 10$ dollars. Now we need $33$ more dollars to reach $133$.  
We can use $10$ coins of $1$ each to get $10$ dollars. We have used $10 \times 1 = 10$ dollars. So now we need $23$ more dollars to reach $133$.  
Since we cannot use any more $1$ dollar coins, we will use $3$ coins of $10$ each to get $30$ dollars. We have used $3 \times 10 = 30$ dollars. Now we need only $3$ more dollars to reach $133$.  
Therefore, the total number of coins needed to make $133$ cents using only coins of $1$, $2$, $5$, and $10$ is:  
$10 + 10 + 3 = 23$ coins."
Response:  If Aliuza has been absent for 54 days and there are 13 weeks in a year, then he has missed  54/13 = 4 weeks of school.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ali has $145 and he spends $72 on something. So, how much does he have left?  
$145 - $72 = $73  
Therefore, Ali has $73 left after spending $72."
Response:  If the friend gave $140 and the total cost was $155, then the amount that the baker needs to cover is $155 - $140 = $15. So, the baker needs $15 more to cover the remaining balance.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Aliuza has 105 kg of flour and wants to make 170 loaves of bread. So, she needs to divide 105 kg by 170 loaves.  105 kg / 170 loaves =?   We can simplify this division by dividing both numbers by their common factor of 5:  105 kg / 5 x 170 loaves =?   Now we have:  21 kg / 340 loaves =?   To find out how much flour each loaf requires, we need to divide the total amount of flour by the number of loaves:  21 kg / 340 loaves = 0.62 kg per loaf   Therefore, Aliuza needs approximately 0.62 kg of flour for each loaf of bread.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has $13$ cents and wants to buy an item costing $154$. So he needs more money. Secondly, we are given that Aliuza has $91$ cents and can afford to buy the same item. Therefore, we need to find out how much more money Aliuza has than Baker. To do this, we subtract the amount of money Baker has from the amount of money Aliuza has: $$ \text{Amount of money needed by Baker} = 154 - 13 = 141 $$ 
So, Aliuza has $141$ cents more than Baker."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has $170 and he wants to buy an item worth $78. So, how much change will he receive from the purchase? To find out, we need to subtract the amount of the item ($78) from the total amount Baker has ($170).  
$170 - $78 =? 
Answer: $92. Therefore, Baker will receive $92 as change."
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker has $110$ and wants to buy something worth $\$75$. So he will have $\$35$ left after buying it. Now, if he wants to buy another thing worth $\$76$, he will not have enough money. Therefore, the maximum amount of money he can spend is $\$35$. So, the answer is $\$35$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has $144$ and he wants to buy an item worth $\$71$. So, after buying the item, how much money will be left with him? We can calculate this as follows: $$ Amount Left = Initial Amount - Purchase Price \quad\Rightarrow\quad Amount Left = \$144 - \$71 \quad\Rightarrow\quad Amount Left = \$73$$ Now, the next part of the question asks us to find out how many more items Ali can buy with the same amount of money. To do this, we need to divide the initial amount by the price of each item: $$ Number of Items = Initial Amount / Price per Item \quad\Rightarrow\quad Number of Items = \$73 / \$111 \quad\Rightarrow\quad Number of Items = 6 $$ Therefore, Ali can buy six more items with the same amount of money.
Response:  If we have  149 - 10 = 139. So, if we add 90 to 139, we get 229. Therefore, the correct answer is 229.
Response:  We know that if we add  15 to 103, we get 118. So, if we subtract 118 from 148, we get 30. Therefore, the difference between 15 and 103 is 30.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that alitengeneza keki 126 is equal to vitafunwa 48. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  126 = 48 x (?) We are looking for the value of ""?"" which represents the number of vitafunwas in 126. To solve this equation, we can divide both sides by 48:  126 / 48 =? / 48 126 / 48 = 48 x? 126 / 48 =?  The result of dividing 126 by 48 is 2 with a remainder of 16. Therefore, the number of vitafunwas in 126 is 2 x 48 + 16 = 96 + 16 = 112. So, the answer is 112."
"Response:  We know that: 
Keki 19 = Vitumbua 131 (given) Keki 70 = Vitumbua 88 (given) To find out how much more vitumbua is needed for keki 19 compared to keki 70, we need to subtract the amount of vitumbua required for keki 70 from the amount of vitumbua required for keki 19. 
So, let's do that: Vitumbua required for keki 19 - Vitumbua required for keki 70 =?  We can calculate this as follows: Vitumbua required for keki 19 = Keki 19 x Vitumbua per keki = 19 x 131 = 2499 Vitumbua required for keki 70 = Keki 70 x Vitumbua per keki = 70 x 88 = 6160 Subtracting the two amounts gives us: Vitumbua required for keki 19 - Vitumbua required for keki 70 = 2499 - 6160 = -3661 So, there are 3661 fewer vitumbus required for keki 19 compared to keki 70."
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker alitengenezwa keki 157 na vitafunwa 169. This means that if we add 157 and 169, we get 326. Now, if we subtract 158 from 326, we get 168. Therefore, the difference between 158 and vitafunwa 147 is 168.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many more points are needed for vitafunwa to catch up with baker. To do this, subtract the number of points that baker has from the number of points that vitafunwa needs to catch up:  
Vitafunwa needs 54 points to catch up with baker (143 - 92 = 51)  Therefore, vitafunwa needs 51 points to catch up with baker."
Response:  If baker made 48 cookies and gave 44 of them away, then he has  48 - 44 = 4 cookies left.
Response:  If Ali had made Ksh. 40 million from his business and he wants to know how much more he needs to make in order to have Ksh. 80 million, we can use subtraction to find out.   Subtracting Ksh. 40 million from Ksh. 80 million gives us:  Ksh. 80 million - Ksh. 40 million =?  The difference between Ksh. 80 million and Ksh. 40 million is:  Ksh. 40 million.  So, Ali needs to make an additional Ksh. 40 million to reach his target of Ksh. 80 million.
Response:  If Rafiki made 137 cakes and each cake required 169 ingredients, then he needed a total of  137 x 169 = 24,053 ingredients to make all the cakes.
Response:  First, we know that the difference between KEKI 173 and KEKI 103 is 70 (173 - 103).   Next, we can see that the difference between KEKI 86 and KEKI 103 is 17 (86 - 103).  Therefore, the total difference between all three numbers is 70 + 17 = 87.  So, the baker needs to add 87 to each of the given keiki to get the correct amount.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has $99$ cents and wants to divide it equally among $167$ people. So each person will receive $\frac{99}{167}$ of a dollar. Now, we need to find out how much each person will receive in shillings since there are $89$ shillings in one dollar. Therefore, we can convert $\frac{99}{167}$ to shillings as follows:  

$$\frac{99}{167} \times 89 =? $$

Answer: $\boxed{\frac{99}{167} \times 89 = 14}$"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has $139$ and wants to buy an item worth $145$. So, he needs to add $6$ more dollars to his money.   Secondly, we are asked how much more does Baker need to add to his money to buy the item. To find this out, we subtract the amount of money Baker already has ($139$) from the cost of the item ($145$). This gives us:   $$ \text{More money needed} = \text{Cost of item} - \text{Amount of money already had} $$ $$ = 145 - 139 $$ $$ = 6 $$ Therefore, Baker needs to add $6$ more dollars to his money to buy the item.
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker has 62 points and kisha has 149 points. So, if we subtract baker's points from kisha's points, we get:  149 - 62 = 87 points. Now, let's look at ali's score. We are given that he scored 144 points. If we add baker's score to ali's score, we get:   87 + 144 = 231 points. Therefore, the total number of points needed for baker to catch up with kisha is 231 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has $81$ and wants to buy an item worth $\$92$. So he needs to pay $\$92 - \$81 = \$11$ more. Now, if Aliuzza pays $\$46$, then she will have paid less than Baker because Baker still owes $\$11$. Therefore, the difference between what Baker paid and what Aliuzza paid is: $$ \text{Difference} = \$92 - \$81 = \$11$$
Response:  First, we know that the total number of students is 167 (given).   Secondly, we are told that 44 students have enrolled in Mikate 44. Therefore, the remaining students who have not enrolled in Mikate 44 are:  167 - 44 = 123  Finally, we are asked how many students will be left if 108 students enroll in Keki 108. So, we need to subtract 108 from 123:  123 - 108 = 15  There are 15 students left after 108 students enroll in Keki 108.
"Response:  First, we know that the difference between  124 and 104 is 20. So, if we add 20 to 104, we get: 
104 + 20 = 124 Therefore, the missing number in the series is 124."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much more Mikate has than Keki in terms of quantity. To do this, we subtract the amount of Keki from the amount of Mikate:  
Mikate - Keki =?  Next, we need to determine if the difference is greater or less than 10. If it is greater than 10, then Mikate has more than Keki by that amount. If it is less than or equal to 10, then Mikate and Keki have the same amount. So, let's calculate the difference:  
Mikate - Keki = 94 - 84 = 10  Since the difference is greater than 10, we can conclude that Mikate has more than Keki by 10 units. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Mikate has 10 more units than Keki."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the difference between $134$ and $11$. This gives us: $$134 - 11 = 123$$ Now, we need to find out how many times $92$ goes into $123$. We can do this by dividing $123$ by $92$: $$123 \div 92 = 134$$ So, there are $134$ times that $92$ goes into $123$. Therefore, the answer is $134$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that baker has 14 eggs and he gives 153 to vitafunwa. So, if we subtract 153 from 14, we get:  14 - 153 = -139 Now, let's check if there are any remaining eggs after giving 8 eggs to vitafunwa. We know that 8 is less than 14, so there will be some remaining eggs. To find out how many eggs remain, we can subtract 8 from 14:  14 - 8 = 6 There are 6 eggs remaining.
Response:  First, we know that baker has 43 cents and wants to buy an item that costs 114 cents. So, he needs to find out how much more money he needs to buy the item. To do this, we subtract 114 from 43:  43 - 114 = -71  This means that baker needs 71 more cents to buy the item. However, if he had 154 cents instead of 43 cents, he would have enough money to buy the item because 154 is greater than 114. Therefore, the difference between 154 and 78 (the amount of money baker already has) is the amount of money he needs to buy the item:  154 - 78 = 76  So, baker needs 76 more cents to buy the item.
"Response: 
Kelly and Michezo played for 22 years, so they have been playing for 22 x 365 = 8070 days.  
They played for 140 minutes each day, so they played for 8070 x 140 = 1129400 minutes in total."
Response:  To get to Michezo 106 from Michezo 64, we need to add 42 to 64.  64 + 42 = 106.
Response:  If Kelly played game 91 and then played game 92, that means she played two games in total. So, the sum of the two numbers is equal to the number of games she played, which is 91 + 92 = 183. Therefore, the correct answer is 183.
Response:  We know that Kelly has played 20 games of Nintendo and 70 games of Sony. So, if we subtract the number of games she played of Sony from the total number of games she played, we will get the number of games she played of Nintendo.  20 (Nintendo) - 70 (Sony) = 50 Therefore, Kelly has played 50 games of Nintendo.
Response:  We know that Kelly won 46 games and Michezo won 132 games. To find out how many games Michezo won more than Kelly, we need to subtract the number of games Kelly won from the total number of games played. So, if we subtract  46 from 132, we get:  132 - 46 = 86 Therefore, Michezo won 86 more games than Kelly.
Response:  We know that there are 80 games in total and we want to find out how many more games will be added if we add 31 more games. To do this, we can subtract the number of games already played (80) from the total number of games (31 + 80).  31 + 80 = 111 So, if we add 31 more games, there will be a total of 111 games.
Response: 1) If Randy has $52 and spends $38, he will have $14 left ($52 - $38 = $14).  2) If Randy has $14 and spends $20, he will be in debt ($14 - $20 = -$6). Therefore, if Randy has $52 and spends $38, he will be in debt $6.
"Response: 1) If Randy has $97 and spends $72, he will have $25 left ($97 - $72 = $25).  2) If Randy wants to buy something that costs $72, he won't have enough money because he only has $25. So, the answer is ""no"" or ""not possible""."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has $79 and he wants to build a house worth $11,000. So, he needs to find out how much more money he needs to borrow. To do this, we subtract the amount he already has ($79) from the total cost of the house ($11,000):  $11,000 - $79 = $10,921 Therefore, Randy needs to borrow $10,921 to build his dream house.
Response: 1st step is to calculate the total value of all assets (vitalu) that Randy has. We know that he has vitalu worth 58 and another one worth 27. So, the total value of his assets is: Total Assets = 58 + 27 = 85.   Now we need to subtract the cost of building the house (nyumba). The cost of building the house is 53. So, we subtract 53 from our previous result: Net Worth = 85 - 53 = 32. Therefore, Randy's net worth after building the house is 32.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has $37 and he wants to build a house which costs $33. So, how much money will be left after building the house?   Secondly, if Randy builds a house using $33, how many houses can he build with $13?  To find out how much money will be left after building the house, we need to subtract the cost of building the house from Randy's initial amount of money.  Cost of building the house = $33 Subtracting $33 from $37 gives us: Amount left after building the house = $37 - $33 = $4 Now, let's calculate how many houses Randy can build with $13. We know that each house costs $33, so we can divide $13 by $33 to get the number of houses he can build: Number of houses Randy can build with $13 = $\frac{13}{33}$ = $\frac{13}{3}$ = 4 Therefore, Randy can build 4 houses with $13.
Response:  To build a house (nyumba), we need to first construct the foundation (mnara). So, we will start with building the foundation.  1. Building the foundation (mnara) requires 86 bricks.  2. Building the walls of the house (kujenga nyumba) require 79 bricks.  3. Therefore, the total number of bricks required to build the house is: 86 + 79 = 165 bricks.
Response:  If Randy is currently 36 years old and will be 59 when he retires, we can calculate his retirement age as follows:  1) First, let's find out how many years Randy has left before retiring:  59 - 36 = 23 years  So, Randy has 23 years until retirement.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how much money Randy needs for building materials (vitalu) based on his budget of $95. He wants to build a house with two rooms and one hall, so he will need materials for walls, roofing, doors, windows, flooring, etc. Assuming that each room requires approximately $30 worth of materials, we can estimate the total cost as follows: Room 1: $30 x 2 = $60 Room 2: $30 x 2 = $60 Hall: $30 x 1 = $30 Total cost of building materials: $60 + $60 + $30 = $150 Since Randy has already spent $50 on buying land, he needs an additional $150 - $50 = $100 to complete the construction of his dream house. Therefore, the answer is $100.
Response: 1st step is to calculate the total cost of building the house and the second step is to compare it with the cost of buying an already built house.  1st Step: Calculate the Total Cost of Building a House The cost of building a house can be calculated as follows: Materials (bricks, cement, sand, etc.) = $50 per square meter Labor costs (carpenters, electricians, plumbers, etc.) = $20 per square meter Foundation and excavation work = $10 per square meter Other miscellaneous expenses (permits, inspections, etc.) = $5 per square meter Based on these estimates, let's assume that the total cost of building a house with an area of 90 square meters would be: Materials = 90 x $50 = $4,500 Labor costs = 90 x $20 = $1,800 Foundation and excavation work = 90 x $10 = $900 Miscellaneous expenses = $500 Therefore, the total cost of building a house with an area of 90 square meters would be: Total cost = $4,500 + $1,800 + $900 + $500 = $7,800 2nd Step: Compare the Cost of Building vs Buying an Already Built House Now, let's compare the cost of building a new house with the cost of buying an already built house. According to the information provided in the problem, the cost of buying an already built house with an area of 89 square meters is $63,000. To determine whether it is cheaper to build or buy, we need to compare the cost of building with the cost of buying. In this case, it appears that buying an already built house is more expensive than building one from scratch. Specifically, the cost of building a new house with an area of 90 square meters is $7,800, while the cost of buying an already built house with an area of 89 square meters is $63,000. Therefore, based on these calculations, it seems that it would be cheaper to build a new house rather than buying an already built one.
Response:  If there are 20 questions in total and we have already answered 5 of them correctly, then we still have 15 more questions to go!
"Response:  We know that there are 13 students in total and 8 of them have chosen the subject ""Crazy Silly School"". So, we can say that 5 students (13 - 8 = 5) have not chosen this subject."
Response:  We know that there are 22 questions in total and we have already answered 10 of them. So, we need to find out how many more questions we can answer based on the information given.   To do this, we can subtract the number of questions we have already answered (10) from the total number of questions (22). This gives us:  22 - 10 = 12  Therefore, we can answer 12 more questions using the information provided.
Response:  We know that there are 19 books in total and 7 of them have been read. So, we can start by subtracting 7 from 19 to find out how many books are left to be read.  19 - 7 = 12  Therefore, there are 12 books left to be read.
Response:  We know that there are 16 books in total and 14 of them have been read. So, we can start by subtracting 14 from 16 to find out how many books haven't been read yet.  16 - 14 = 2  Therefore, there are 2 books left that haven't been read yet. However, we also know that one student has read 13 books, so we need to subtract that number from the total number of books to find out how many books the other student needs to read.  2 - 13 = -11 Oops! It looks like the other student needs to read 11 more books to catch up with their classmate who has already read 13 books.
Response:  We know that there are 19 books in total and 61 chapters in each book. So, if we multiply 19 by 61, we get:  19 x 61 = 1179   Therefore, there are 1179 chapters in all of the books combined.
Response:  If we have 10 questions and each question has 11 options, then the total number of possible answers is  10 x 11 = 110.  Now, if we miss one question (question 13), we would only be able to attempt 12 questions, so the total number of possible answers for 12 questions would be  12 x 11 = 132. Therefore, the difference between the two totals is  132 - 110 = 22. So, there are 22 more possible answers when attempting 12 questions instead of 10 questions.
Response:  We know that there are 11 questions in total and we have already answered 7 of them. So, the number of questions left to be answered is:  11 - 7 = 4.
Response:  We know that there are 14 topics in the Crazy Silly School series and we want to find out how many more books will be added if each book has 8 pages.   First, let's calculate the total number of pages in all 14 books:  14 x 8 = 112 pages Now, we need to add more pages to reach our desired number of 120 pages. So, we can add:  120 - 112 = 8 pages Therefore, we need to add 8 more books to the Crazy Silly School series.
"Response:  We know that there are 62 students in class 1 and 19 students in class 34. To find out how many more students are needed for class 34 to have as many students as class 1, we need to subtract the number of students in class 34 from the number of students in class 1.  
So, if we subtract 19 (the number of students in class 34) from 62 (the number of students in class 1), we get:  
62 - 19 = 43  Therefore, class 34 needs 43 more students to have as many students as class 1."
"Response:  We know that there are 21 items in total (21 tofauti). If we have already identified 7 items (vitabu 7), then we need to find out how many more items we need to identify to reach the total of 21. To do this, we can subtract the number of items we have already identified from the total number of items:  21 - 7 = 14 So, we need to identify 14 more items to complete the list of all 21 items in the ""Crazy Silly School"" story."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 types of questions in the ""Crazy Silly School"" category and 40 questions in total. To find out how many more questions there are in the ""Crazy Silly School"" category than in the other categories, we need to subtract the number of questions in all the other categories from 40.  
So, if there are 11 questions in all the other categories combined (since each category has 11 questions), then there must be:  
40 - 11 = 29 additional questions in the ""Crazy Silly School"" category."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 questions in total for the ""Crazy Silly School"" section of the test. If we have already answered 11 questions and there are 63 questions in total, then we can calculate how many more questions we need to answer as follows:  63 - 11 = 52. Therefore, there are 52 more questions left to answer in the ""Crazy Silly School"" section of the test."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 students in class 6 who will watch the movie ""Crazy Silly School"". If each student has 19 questions about the movie, then the total number of questions is:  10 x 19 = 190 questions."
Response:  We know that there are 19 students in total and they have chosen 16 books. So we can start by finding out how many books each student has chosen. To do this, we need to divide the number of books by the number of students. In this case, we would divide 16 by 19.  16 √∑ 19 =?  What is the result of this calculation?
Response:  If Dave has $7 and he wants to buy something that costs $2, how much change will he receive if he pays with a $10 bill?   First, let's find out how much change Dave will receive if he pays with a $10 bill:   Change = $10 - $2 = $8   So, Dave will receive $8 in change if he pays with a $10 bill.
"Response:  If Dave has 12 tickets and each ticket is worth Ksh. 100, then he has Ksh. 1200 (12 x Ksh. 100).  
If he sells all his tickets at Ksh. 14 each, how much money will he get in total?  To find out, we multiply the number of tickets he has by the new price: Ksh. 12 x Ksh. 14 = Ksh. 1680.  So, if Dave sells all his tickets at Ksh. 14 each, he will get Ksh. 1680 in total."
"Response:  We know that Dave has 18 tickets and he wants to distribute them among 5 people so that each person gets at least 11 tickets. To do this, we need to find out how many groups of 11 tickets can be made from 18 tickets.  
We can start by finding out how many times 18 goes into 11. Using our mental math skills or a calculator, we can see that 18 goes into 11 exactly 1.6 times (remainder is 0). This means we can make 11 groups of 18/11 = 1.6 x 11 = 17.6 tickets. Since we cannot have a fraction of a ticket, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 18 tickets. Therefore, Dave can give 18 tickets to 5 people, with each person getting 11 tickets."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has 19 tickets and he wants to sell them at a price of 12 for each ticket. So, if he sells all his tickets, he will get 19 x 12 = 228. However, he also needs to buy 7 more tickets to complete the set of 26 tickets required for the game. Therefore, the total amount Dave needs to spend is 228 + 7 x 12 = 228 + 84 = 312.  
So, the answer is 312."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has 13 tickets and he wants to sell them at Ksh. 8 each. So, if he sells all his tickets, he will get:  13 x 8 = 104   Now, let's consider the situation where he decides to sell only 18 tickets instead of all 13. In this case, he will have 13 - 18 = 5 tickets left unsold. Therefore, the amount of money he will miss out on is:  5 x 8 = 40   Since he will miss out on more money by selling only 18 tickets (Ksh. 40), it is better for him to sell all his tickets at Ksh. 8 each.
Response:  If Dave has 14 tickets and he wants to buy 2 more tickets, then he will have 14 + 2 = 16 tickets in total. Now, if he has 10 items that he can use to exchange for the tickets, then he can exchange  10 x 1 = 10 tickets for each ticket, so he will get 10 x 16 = 160 tickets. Therefore, Dave will have a total of 160 tickets after buying 2 more tickets with his existing 14 tickets and exchanging 10 items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley had 14 friends in her class before Kimbunga joined. After Kimbunga joined, 9 more students left the school. So, if we subtract 9 from 14, we get:  14 - 9 = 5 Therefore, Haley has 5 friends left in her class after Kimbunga joined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley had 13 friends in her class before Kimbunga left. Secondly, after Kimbunga left, Haley was left with 6 friends. Finally, we want to find out how many more friends Haley lost apart from Kimbunga. To do this, we subtract the number of friends she had after Kimbunga left (6) from the total number of friends she had before Kimbunga left (13). This gives us:  13 - 6 = 7 So, Haley lost 7 friends apart from Kimbunga.
Response: 16 - 4 = 12. So, there are 12 items left after Kimbunga took 4 items.
Response:  If Haley has 12 apples and she gives 5 to her friend, how many apples will she have left?  12 - 5 = 7 So, Haley will have 7 apples left.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many cows were left after Kimbunga took 4 cows. We know that Haley had 9 cows and Kimbunga took 4, so we subtract 4 from 9:  9 - 4 = 5 So, there are 5 cows left. Now, we need to find out how many more cows Ana needs to take to have as many cows as Haley has. To do this, we subtract the number of cows Ana currently has (5) from the number of cows Haley has (9):  9 - 5 = 4 So, Ana needs to take 4 more cows to have as many cows as Haley has.
Response:  If Haley had 12 marbles at first and she lost 2, then she has 12 - 2 = 10 marbles left.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 items in total and we want to find out how many more items will be added if we add 3 more items. To do this, we can subtract the number of items already present (3) from the total number of items (13). So, the difference between 13 and 3 is:  
13 - 3 = 10  Therefore, if we add 3 more items, there will be a total of 10 + 3 = 13 items."
Response:  If Haley had 11 friends and each friend gave her $2 as a gift, then she would have received a total of  11 x $2 = $22. However, if she spent $5 on something else, then she would be left with $22 - $5 = $17. Therefore, Haley has $17 in total.
Response:  We know that Kisha has 66 cents and she wants to buy an item that costs 28 cents. So we can start by subtracting 28 from 66.  66 - 28 =?  48   Therefore, Kisha will have 48 cents left after buying the item.
Response:  If Kisha has 8 pencils and she uses 24 to make a machine, how many pencils will she have left after using all the 24 pencils?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of pencils used (24) from the total number of pencils available (8).   So, if Kisha uses all the 24 pencils, she will be left with 8 - 24 = 0 pencils. Therefore, she will not have any pencils left.
Response: 1st step is to calculate the number of days in 4 weeks. We know that there are 7 days in one week, so:  4 weeks x 7 days/week = 28 days  Now we have 28 days. Next, we need to find out how many hours are in 28 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so:  28 days x 24 hours/day = 672 hours  Finally, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):  672 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 39,360 minutes  So, the total number of minutes in 4 weeks is approximately 39,360 minutes.
Response:  We know that Kisha has 38 cows and each cow gives birth to one calf after every 49 days of lactation period (mavuno). So, if we calculate the total number of calves born in one year, we get:  38 x 1 = 38 calves born in one year.
Response:  We know that Kisha has 66 cows and each cow gives 25 liters of milk per day. So, in total, Kisha produces  66 x 25 = 1650 liters of milk per day. Now, we are asked to find out how many days it will take for Kisha to produce 87,000 liters of milk if she continues producing milk at the same rate. To do this, we divide the total amount of milk (87,000) by the daily production (1650):  87,000 / 1650 = 52 days. Therefore, it will take Kisha 52 days to produce 87,000 liters of milk if she continues producing milk at the same rate.
Response:  We know that there are  8 bags of cement and each bag weighs 35 kg. So, in total, there is  8 x 35 = 280 kg of cement.
Response:  We know that Kisha has 16 pieces of machungwa and each piece weighs 57 grams. To find out how much Kisha's total weight is, we can multiply 16 by 57, which gives us:  16 x 57 = 922 grams.  So, Kisha's total weight is 922 grams.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 67 students in class and each student has 12 books. Therefore, the total number of books is  67 x 12 = 804 books. Now, if each book contains 35 pages, then the total number of pages is  804 x 35 = 28,120 pages.
Response:  We know that Kisha has been alive for 74 years and will be 71 years old next year. So, we can subtract 71 from 74 to find out how many years she has left to live.  74 - 71 = 3 Years. Therefore, Kisha has 3 years left to live.
"Response: 1) We know that Kisha has 76 cows and each cow produces 50 liters of milk per day.  2) We also know that she wants to sell 64 liters of milk per day. So we need to find out how many cows she needs to keep in order to meet her daily demand. 3) To do this, we can set up an equation using ""x"" as the number of cows needed:   x \* 50 = 64  where ""x"" is the unknown quantity (the number of cows).  4) Solving for ""x"", we get:  x = 64 / 50 = 1.28 or approximately 13 cows.  Therefore, Kisha needs to keep at least 13 cows to meet her daily demand of 64 liters of milk."
"Response:  We know that there are 28 machungwa in the first group and 52 machungwa in the second group.  If we add these two numbers together, we get 80.  
However, the total number of machungwa is not equal to the sum of the two groups because some machungwa belong to both groups. To find out how many machungwa belong to neither group, we need to subtract the number of machungwa in the first group from the number of machungwa in the second group.  
So, if we subtract 28 from 52, we get 24. Therefore, there are 24 machungwa that do not belong to either group."
Response:  We know that there are 82 machungwa in total and we want to find out how many of them will be eaten within 25 days.   Firstly, let's divide the number of machungwa into groups of 25.   There are 82 / 25 = 3 groups of machungwa.   Now, we need to calculate how many machungwa will be left after 25 days.   For each group of machungwa, we can subtract 25 from the total number of machungwa in that group.   Group 1 has 27 machungwa (82 - 25 + 27), Group 2 has 24 machungwa (82 - 25 + 24), and Group 3 has 21 machungwa (82 - 25 + 21).   Therefore, after 25 days, there will be 27 + 24 + 21 = 72 machungwa left.
"Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and 24 days in February, so together they have 55 days (31 + 24).  
Now, if we subtract 45 days from 55 days, we get... Drumroll please... 10 days!  Yes, you heard right; after 45 days, there will be 10 days left of the month."
Response:  We know that there are 44 machungwa (A) and 25 machungwa (B). We also know that A is greater than B. So we can write:  44 > 25  Now we need to find out how much more A is greater than B. To do this, we subtract 25 from 44:  44 - 25 =?  The result of this subtraction is:  19  Therefore, A is 19 more than B.
Response:  We know that there are 5 machungwa (A) and 74 machungwa (B). To find out how many more machungwas B has than A, we subtract:  74 - 5 = 69. So, B has 69 more machungwas than A.
Response:  If Walivuna has lived for 54 years and has been sick for 18 years, we can calculate her age as follows:   Age = Total years lived - Years spent sick   Age = 54 - 18   Age = 36 Therefore, Walivuna is currently 36 years old.
"Response:  We know that Kisha has 56 Machungwa and she wants to divide them into groups of 14 each. So we can start by dividing 56 by  14.  56 / 14 =?  
Now, let's simplify our calculation.  56 / 14 = 4 with a remainder of 0. This means Kisha has 4 complete groups of 14 Machungwa each, and no remaining Machungwa.  Therefore, the numeric answer is 4."
Response:  We know that there are 25 machungwa (chickens) in total and 5 of them will be given away as gifts. So, we need to find out how many chickens will remain after giving away the gifts.   To do this, we can subtract the number of chickens given away from the total number of chickens. Total number of chickens = 25 Machungwa Given away = 5 Subtracting 5 from 25 gives us: Remaining number of chickens = 25 - 5 = 20 Therefore, there will be 20 machungwa remaining after giving away the gifts.
Response:  We know that there are 65 machungwa in total and we want to find out how many of them will be eaten within 6 days. To do this, we need to divide the number of machungwa by the number of days. So, if we divide 65 by 6, we get:  65 √∑ 6 = 10   Therefore, 10 machungwa will be eaten each day for 6 days.
Response:  We know that there are 41 machungwa (A) that have been vaccinated and 86 machungwa (B) that have not been vaccinated. To find out how many more machungwa B need to be vaccinated, we subtract the number of vaccinated A from the total number of machungwa B.  41 + 86 = 127  So, 86 - 41 = 45  Therefore, 45 more machungwa B need to be vaccinated.
Response:  We know that there are 71 machungwa (beads) in the first string and 60 machungwa in the second string. To find out how many more beads are in the first string than in the second string, we need to subtract the number of beads in the second string from the number of beads in the first string.  71 - 60 = 11 So, there are 11 more beads in the first string than in the second string.
Response:  To find out how many more bricks are needed for the wall that is 12 meters long and 11 meters high, we need to calculate the volume of the wall first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is L x W x H, where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height. In this case, the length (L) is 12 meters, the width (W) is 1 meter (since it's a single-brick wide), and the height (H) is 11 meters. So, the volume of the wall is:   V = L x W x H = 12 x 1 x 11 = 132 cubic meters Now, we need to know how many bricks are required to build the wall. Since each brick has a volume of 0.1 cubic meters, we can divide the total volume of the wall by the volume of one brick to get the number of bricks needed:   Number of bricks = Volume of wall / Volume of one brick = 132 / 0.1 = 1320 bricks Therefore, 1320 bricks would be needed to build the wall that is 12 meters long and 11 meters high.
Response:  To get from room 7 to room 14 using only the stairs, we need to go up 7 steps and then down 7 steps. So, the total number of steps is 7 + 7 = 14.   Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  To get from Jesse's age of 7 to Methuselah's age of 14, we need to add 7 + 7 = 14.   Therefore, Jesse is 14 years old.
"Response:  To get from point F to point G (futi 16), we need to add 4 more units to our displacement (from point E to point F). So, the total displacement from point A to point G is:  
Displacement = 11 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 units."
"Response:  We know that Jesse has $2 and wants to buy two items that cost $12 in total. If he buys one item at $4, how much will be left with after buying the first item?   First, let's calculate how much Jesse will spend on the first item:  4 x $4 = $16  Now, let's subtract what Jesse spent on the first item from his initial amount of money:   $2 - $16 = $-$14  So, Jesse will have $-$14 left after buying the first item.  To find out how much he will have left after buying both items, we need to add the remaining amount ($-$14) to the price of the second item:   Second item price + (-$14) =?  Since Jesse has $-$14 left, if he adds this amount to the price of the second item, he will still not have enough money to buy it. Therefore, the answer is ""not enough."""
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 students in class 19 and 18 students in class 18. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  19 + 18 = 37  Now, we need to find out how many more students are needed to make up 20 students in total. To do this, we subtract 37 from 20:  20 - 37 = -17  This means that there are 17 fewer students in the combined classes than there would be if all the students were divided evenly into two classes of 20 students each.
Response:  If Jesse has $19 and wants to buy something that costs $20, then he will not have enough money to buy it. So, the difference between what Jesse has ($19) and what he needs ($20) is $1.   Therefore, if Jesse wants to buy something that costs $20, he will need an additional $1 to make up the difference.
Response:  If we have 10 bricks and we want to build a wall of 5 bricks high, then we need 5 more bricks. So, we will need 5 + 10 = 15 bricks in total.
Response:  If we have $10$ coins and we want to make $2$ groups of coins such that each group has at least $5$ coins, then we can do it in the following way:   We will distribute the first $5$ coins among the two groups randomly. Then, we will take the remaining $5$ coins and divide them equally between the two groups. So, each group will have at least $5$ coins.  Now, let's calculate the number of ways this can be done:  There are $\binom{10}{5}$ ways to choose the first $5$ coins for each group (since there are $10$ coins in total and we need to choose $5$ of them). And for each of these choices, there are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to divide the remaining $5$ coins equally between the two groups (since there are $5$ coins in each group). Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the coins is: $$ \binom{10}{5} \times \binom{5}{2} = \frac{10!}{5!5!} \times \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \boxed{50\cdot4=200} $$ So, there are $200$ ways to distribute the $10$ coins into two groups of at least $5$ coins each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 18 marbles in total and he wants to divide them equally among four friends. So, if we divide 18 by 4, we get:  18 / 4 = 4 Now, each friend will get 4 marbles. However, Jesse also wants to give two extra marbles to one of his friends as a special gift. So, let's consider how many marbles this friend will receive. We can calculate this by adding 2 to the number of marbles each friend will receive:  4 + 2 = 6 This means that one friend will receive 6 marbles as a gift from Jesse. Therefore, the final distribution of marbles among all four friends is: Friend 1: 4 + 2 = 6 marbles Friend 2: 4 + 2 = 6 marbles Friend 3: 4 + 2 = 6 marbles Friend 4: 4 marbles Total: 18 marbles distributed among 4 friends.
Response:  We know that there are 23 players on each team and we want to find out how many points will be scored by one player from Arkansas or Texas Tech.   Firstly, let's calculate the total number of points that can be scored by all the players on both teams combined: Total points = (23 x 2) = 46 points Now, let's distribute these points among the two teams: Arkansas - 23 points Texas Tech - 23 points Since we want to find out how many points one player from either team will score, we need to divide the total points by the number of players on each team: Arkansas - 23 points / 23 players = 1 point per player Texas Tech - 23 points / 23 players = 1 point per player Therefore, one player from either Arkansas or Texas Tech will score 1 point.
Response:  We know that each Razorback has eaten 51 kilograms of food and there are three of them in total. So, the total amount of food consumed by all three Razorbacks is 51 x 3 = 153 kilograms.   Now, we need to find out how much food each Fulana has consumed. Since there are four Fulanas in total (three Razorbacks and one Fulana), we can divide the total amount of food consumed by three to get the average amount of food consumed per Fulana: 153 kg / 3 = 51 kg per Fulana.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money spent on both trips is $87 + $95 = $182.  If they spent $47 during the trip to Arkansas, then the remaining amount for the trip to Texas Tech would be $182 - $47 = $135.
Response:  We know that the total number of points scored by both teams is 242.  If the Razorbacks scored 106 points and the Red Raiders scored 136 points, then we can set up the equation:  106 + 136 = 242.  Solving for x (the number of points scored by the Red Raiders), we get:  136 = 242 - 106.  Subtracting 106 from both sides gives us:   36 = 136.  Therefore, the Red Raiders scored 36 points in the game against Arkansas.
Response:  We know that the total number of points scored by both teams is 163 (Arkansas + Texas Tech).   If one team scores 89 points during the game against Arkansas, then the other team must have scored 74 points (163 - 89 = 74) during their game against Texas Tech.
Response:  We know that the total number of points scored by both teams is 186 (Arkansas) + 172 (Texas Tech) = 358.  If we subtract the number of points scored by Arkansas from the total number of points scored, we get:  358 - 186 = 172.  Therefore, the number of points scored by Texas Tech is 172.
Response:  We know that Duka la Razorback has scored 62 points against Fulana and 99 points against Jezi. In addition, we are given that the score of Arkansas vs. Texas Tech was 183-31. To find out how much money Duka la Razorback made from these games, we need to calculate the total number of points scored by Duka la Razorback in all three games. Total points = (62 + 99) + 183 = 244 Therefore, Duka la Razorback made $244 from these games.
Response:  We know that Duka la Razorback scored 67 points against Fulana and 165 points against Jezi. During the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech, Fulana scored 74 points while Jezi scored 156 points. To find out how much more points Jezi scored than Fulana, we can subtract the number of points scored by Fulana from the number of points scored by Jezi:  156 - 74 = 82 Therefore, Jezi scored 82 more points than Fulana.
"Response:  We know that Fulana scored 157 points and Jezi scored 19 points in their respective games against Arkansas and Texas Tech. To find out how many more points Fulana scored than Jezi, we need to subtract the number of points scored by Jezi from the number of points scored by Fulana.  
So, we can say that Fulana scored (157 - 19) = 138 more points than Jezi."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the difference between the number of points scored by the Razorbacks and the Red Raiders is given as  254 - 43 = 211.  Secondly, we are asked to find out how many more points were scored by the Razorbacks than the Red Raiders. To do this, we subtract the number of points scored by the Red Raiders from the total number of points scored by the Razorbacks. Therefore, we have:  211 = (86 + 232) - (43 + 254). Simplifying the equation, we get:  211 = 318 - 297. Solving for the difference, we get:  211 = 21. So, the Razorbacks scored 21 more points than the Red Raiders.
Response:  We know that $51$ is divided among $8$ people, so each person gets $\frac{51}{8} = 6$ dollars.  Now we need to find out how much $130$ is divided among these same $8$ people. So we can use the same formula: $\frac{130}{8} =?$
"Response:  We know that $217$ is the total amount of money spent on the trip to Arkansas and Texas Tech.  We also know that each person spent $201$ on their trip. Therefore, we can calculate how many people went on the trip as follows:  
$$ \text{Total Amount Spent} = \text{Number of People} \times \text{Amount Each Person Spent} $$  Substituting the given values, we get:  
$$ 217 = x \times 201 $$  Where $x$ represents the number of people who went on the trip. Solving for $x$, we get:  
$$ x = \frac{217}{201} $$  Simplifying, we get:  
$$ x = 108 $$  So there were $108$ people who went on the trip."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money spent at Arkansas and Texas Tech is $60. If each Razorback fan spends $10 on merchandise, then the number of fans who purchased merchandise can be found by dividing $60 by $10.  
So, the number of fans who purchased merchandise is:  
$60 √∑ $10 = 6  
Therefore, six Razorback fans purchased merchandise."
Response:  We know that the total cost of attending both games is $215 and we want to find out how much each game costs. To do this, we can use the following equation: Total Cost = Game 1 + Game 2. Since we are given that the cost of one game is $5, we can write: Game 1 = $5. Now, we need to find out what Game 2 costs. We know that the total cost is $215, so if we subtract Game 1 from the total cost, we get: Game 2 = $215 - $5 = $210. Therefore, the cost of each game is $5 for Game 1 and $210 for Game 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Duka la Razorback has won 5 games and lost 215 games. This means that their win-loss ratio is 5/215 = 1/43. Now, if they play against Arkansas and Texas Tech, let's assume they will win 20 games and lose 64 games. So, their total record for these two teams would be  20 + (5 x 43) = 20 + 210 = 230 games. Therefore, the amount of money they would earn based on their win-loss ratio is $230 x $100 = $23,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Duka has $76 and wants to buy a Razorback at $204. So, he needs to find out how many Razorbacks he can buy with his money. Secondly, we are given that Arkansas and Texas Tech have scored 158 points each, but we don't know how many points they scored in total. Finally, we want to know how much money Duka will make if he buys one Razorback.   To start, let's divide the amount of money Duka has ($76) by the cost of one Razorback ($204):  76 √∑ 204 = 0.37   This means that Duka can buy approximately 0.37 Razorbacks with his money. Now, let's multiply the number of points scored by each team (158 x 2 = 316) by the number of Razorbacks Duka can buy (0.37 x 2 = 0.74):  316 x 0.74 = 235.44   Therefore, if Duka buys one Razorback, he will make approximately $235.44.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Duka la Razorback scored 210 points against an opponent who scored 240 points (fulana). This means that fulana scored 30 more points than Duka la Razorback.   Secondly, we are given that fulana scored 177 points and Duka la Razorback scored 23 points. So, to find out how many more points fulana scored than Duka la Razorback, we subtract 23 from 177: 177 - 23 = 154. Therefore, fulana scored 154 more points than Duka la Razorback.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Duka scored 115 points against Razorback and 25 points against Fulana. Secondly, we are given that Arkansas and Texas Tech played each other and their scores were 113-78. Finally, we want to find out how many more points did Duka score than Fulana. To do this, we need to subtract the number of points scored by Fulana from the number of points scored by Duka. So let's calculate:  115 - 25 = 90 Therefore, Duka scored 90 more points than Fulana.
Response:  If there are 5 sets of 10 items each, then there will be 5 x 10 = 50 items in total. However, if we want to know how many more items there are in the last set compared to the first set, we need to subtract the number of items in the first set from the total number of items. So,  50 - 10 = 40. Therefore, there are 40 more items in the last set than in the first set.
Response:  If there are 12 pieces of furniture in the room and each piece has 2 legs, then we have a total of  12 x 2 = 24 legs.  Now, if each leg needs to be paired with another leg, we need to pair up all these legs. Since there are no odd numbered legs (all legs are in pairs), we can simply divide the total number of legs by 2 to find out how many pairs of legs we have. So, we have  24 / 2 = 12 pairs of legs.
Response: 1st, we know that there are 3 people in the house and each person has taken 9 items. So, if we multiply 3 x 9 = 27 items have been taken altogether. Now, since there were initially 27 items in the basket, and 27 - 9 = 18 items remain. Therefore, there are 18 items left in the basket.
Response:  We have 11 sets of 13 objects each, for a total of  11 x 13 = 143 objects.  Since we want to distribute these objects among 13 people, each person will receive  143 / 13 = approximately 11 objects per person.
"Response:  We have 11 people and we need to divide them into groups of 6 or less.  
We can start by dividing 11 by 2: 11 / 2 = 5 with a remainder of 3 (there are 3 people left over).  So, we can make 5 groups of 6 or less:  
Group 1: 6 people (the remaining 3 people cannot be divided evenly among the other groups) Group 2: 5 people + 1 person (remainder from previous group) = 6 people Group 3: 5 people + 1 person (remainder from previous group) = 6 people Group 4: 5 people + 1 person (remainder from previous group) = 6 people Group 5: 6 people (no remainders this time!) Therefore, there are 5 complete groups of 6 people each, and 1 incomplete group of 5 people."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 sets of 14 items each, which gives us a total of  12 x 14 = 168 items.  However, we also know that there are 6 extra items, so the total number of items is actually  168 + 6 = 174.  Therefore, the answer to the question ""Wana viti vingapi kwa ajili ya wageni?"" (How many items will be left after all the sets have been distributed?) is  174 - 12 = 162 items."
Response:  We have 14 people and we want to divide them into groups of 4 and 3.   To do this, we need to find out how many groups of 4 we can make with 14 people.  We know that 4 x 3 = 12, so we can make 12 groups of 4.  But wait! We also need to find out how many groups of 3 we can make with 14 people.  We know that 3 x 4 = 12, so we can make 12 groups of 3 as well.  So, in total, we can make 24 groups (12 groups of 4 and 12 groups of 3).  Now, let's check if our answer makes sense.  If we have 14 people and we want to divide them into groups of 4 and 3, then we should be able to make at least 24 groups in total.  And indeed, we have found exactly 24 groups!
Response:  We know that there are 14 students in total and each table has 9 students. So we can start by finding out how many tables there will be:  14 / 9 = 1 (table) Therefore, there will be one table with 9 students. The remaining 5 students will not have a place at any of the tables, so they will sit separately.
Response:  We know that Ikiwa has $460 and wants to buy five watermelons at $90 each. So, we can calculate how much money she will have after buying one watermelon first.  1) First, let's calculate how much money Ikiwa will spend on one watermelon: $90 x 1 = $90 2) Now, let's subtract the amount spent from her initial amount of money: $460 - $90 = $370  Therefore, after buying one watermelon, Ikiwa will be left with $370.  To find out how much money she will have after buying all five watermelons, we can simply multiply the amount left after buying one watermelon by five: $370 x 5 = $1,850  So, Ikiwa will have $1,850 after buying all five watermelons.
Response:  We know that Lewis has $ 1216 after spending $ 16 each week for 7 weeks. So we can calculate how much he spent in total as follows:   Total amount spent = Number of weeks x Amount spent per week  Total amount spent = 7 x $ 16  Total amount spent = $ 112  Now we can find out how much money Lewis has left by subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount he had:  Money left = Initial amount - Total amount spent  Money left = $ 1216 - $ 112  Money left = $ 1104  Therefore, Lewis has $ 1104 left after spending $ 16 each week for 7 weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has $ 21,600 in his savings account. Secondly, he wants to buy a car worth $ 7,020. So, how much money will be left after buying the car? To find out, subtract the cost of the car from the amount of money Lewis has:   $ 21,600 - $ 7,020 = $ 14,580 Therefore, there will be $ 14,580 left after buying the car.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Kama has $1357 and wants to buy a car worth $223. So he needs to find out how many cars he can buy with his money. To do this, we divide $1357 by $223:  
$1357 √∑ $223 =?  
We get:  
$1357 √∑ $223 = 6  
This means Kama can buy 6 cars with his money. However, the problem states that he only needs to buy one car. Therefore, we need to find out how much money he will have left after buying one car. To do this, we subtract $223 from $1357:  
$1357 - $223 =?  
We get:  
$1357 - $223 = $1134  
So, after buying one car worth $223, Kama will be left with $1134."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $28 per week and works for 1091 weeks (which is approximately 22 years). So, he earns:  28 x 1091 = $31,548 per year. Now, we are asked to find out how much money Lewis will have if he works for 939 weeks (approximately 20 years) instead of working for 1091 weeks. To do this, we need to subtract the number of weeks he won't work from the total number of weeks he would have worked:  31,548 x (1091 - 939) = $31,548 x 152 = $4,767. Therefore, if Lewis works for 939 weeks instead of 1091 weeks, he will have $4,767 less than what he would have had if he worked for the full 1091 weeks.
Response:  We know that Lewis has $ 403 left after buying 233 kilograms of maize at $ 1.50 per kilogram. To find out how much money he will have after buying more maize, we need to subtract the cost of the additional maize from the amount he already has.   If he buys 49 kilograms of maize at the same price, the cost would be:  49 x $ 1.50 = $ 78.50  So, the total amount of money Lewis will have after buying both batches of maize is:  $ 403 - $ 78.50 = $ 324.50
Response:  We know that Lewis has $ 368 at the beginning of week 1359 and he spends $ 388 during the week. So, how much does he have left after spending $ 388?   To find out, we can subtract the amount spent ($ 388) from the initial amount ($ 368): $$ 368 - 388 =? $$  Simplifying the subtraction, we get: $$ 368 - 388 = -20 $$ Since the result is negative, it means that Lewis has less money now than he did before spending the $ 388. Specifically, he has $ -20 less than he had initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has $ 491 and spends $ 216 every week. So, how much does he have left after spending $ 216?   We can calculate this by subtracting $ 216 from $ 491: $$ 491 - 216 = 275 $$ Therefore, Lewis has $ 275 left after spending $ 216 every week.
"Response:  We know that Lewis has $133 and he wants to divide it among 19 people. So we need to find out how much each person will get if they share this money equally. To do this, we can use division.  

$133 √∑ 19 =?  (This is read as ""one hundred thirty-three divided by nineteen equals what?"")

So, if we calculate the result of this division, we get:

$133 √∑ 19 = $7

Therefore, each person will get $7 if Lewis divides his money equally among them."
"Response:  If we have $200 and spend $25 on something, how much do we have left?  
$200 - $25 = $175  So, if we have $178 and spend $25, we will be left with $175 + $25 = $195."
"Response:  If Dean has 10 cups of water and gives 9 cups to someone, then he will have 1 cup left.  
So, if we want to know how many cups of water Dean has after giving 9 cups away, we can simply subtract 9 from 10, which gives us 1 cup."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dean has 8 chins and each chin has 14 fingers. Therefore, the total number of fingers is 8 x 14 = 112. Now, if Ron has 5 more fingers than Dean, then Ron will have 112 + 5 = 117 fingers. So, the missing finger for Ron is 117 - 112 = 5.
Response:  If Ron has 5 units of water and he uses 11 units to fill his futi (container), then he has 5 - 11 = -6 units of water left. This means that Ron does not have any water left in his container after using it to fill the futi.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Dean has been drinking for 15 years and he is currently 4 years older than Ron. So, if Ron is 13 years old now, how old was Dean when he started drinking?  

Answer:  If Ron is 13 years old now and Dean is 4 years older, then Dean was 17 years old when he started drinking (13 + 4 = 17)."
Response:  If Ron has 16 years of experience and Dean has 9 more years than Ron, then Dean has 16 + 9 = 25 years of experience.   Now, if Ron had 13 years of experience instead, we would have:  Dean - Ron = 25 - 13 = 12 years difference in experience between them.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ron has 15 points and Dean has 6 points. So, if they both play their respective games, Ron will have 20 points (15 + 5) while Dean will have 18 points (6 + 12). Now, let's compare their scores to determine who wins. Since Ron has more points than Dean, Ron wins this game.
Response:  We have three books with pages numbered from 1 to 34. Each book has 2 pages with the same number. So, we need to find out how many pairs of pages are there in total.  ü§î Think...  Can you spot the pattern?  Here's a hint: each pair of pages has the same number! üòâ Now, let's count the pairs of pages:  1 & 1 (first page of each book) üìö‚ûù 2 & 2 (second page of each book) üìö‚ûù... üìö‚ûù 32 & 32 (last page of each book) üìö‚ûù Total pairs of pages = 34/2 = 17 pairs. üéâ There are 17 pairs of pages in total!
"Response:  We know that there are 42 books in total and each book has two pages. So, if we divide 42 by 2, we get:  
42 √∑ 2 =?  
The result is:  
42 √∑ 2 = 21  
Therefore, there are 21 pairs of pages in all the books combined."
Response:  We know that there are 27 pages in each magazine and 80 pages total for all three magazines.  If we divide 80 by 27, we get:  80/27 = 3 So, there are 3 complete sets of 27-page magazines.  Now, let's find out how many extra pages there are.  We can do this by subtracting the number of complete sets from the total number of pages:  80 - 3 x 27 = 80 - 81 = 49 There are 49 extra pages.
Response:  We have 9 magazines with 46 pages each, so we multiply 9 x 46 = 414 pages in total.   If we divide this number by 10 (the number of issues), we get:  414 pages / 10 issues = 41.4 pages per issue.
"Response:  We have 23 words in each magazine and 61 total words. To find out how many times the word ""vita"" appears in all six magazines, we need to multiply the number of words in each magazine by the number of times the word ""vita"" appears in that magazine.   So, for Magazine 1, there are 23 x 29 = 647 instances of the word ""vita"". For Magazine 2, there are 23 x 28 = 574 instances of the word ""vita"". And so on...  Now let's add up all these instances:  647 + 574 +... + 290 = 2,998 instances of the word ""vita"" across all six magazines."
"Response:  We know that there are 28 pages in total and each page has 7 lines of text. So we can start by dividing 28 by 7 to find out how many groups of 7 lines there are:  

28 √∑ 7 = 4 with a remainder of 1 (there is one line left over)

So there are 4 complete groups of 7 lines each, plus one extra line remaining. Therefore, the number of vitabus in each group is:  

4 x 7 = 28

Therefore, the answer is 28 vitabus."
"Response: 1st step is to find out how many books are written by Bryan. We know that there are 38 books altogether and Bryan has written 2 of them. So, we can say that Bryan has written  2/38 = 1/19 of all the books. 
Now, if we want to find out how many more books are left for other authors to write, we need to subtract the number of books written by Bryan from the total number of books. Total number of books - Number of books written by Bryan = 38 - 2 = 36 books. Therefore, there are 36 books left for other authors to write."
Response:  If Carol has 10 friends and each friend gives her $2 as a gift, then she will have a total of  10 x $2 = $20.  Now, if she wants to divide this money among her 2 closest friends, she can give them $14 each ($20 - $6).
"Response:  We know that Carol has 12 friends and each friend gave her 3 gifts. So, in total, Carol received 3 x 12 = 36 gifts. Now, we are asked if there is any gift that Carol received more than once. Since we are looking for a specific gift, let's count how many times each gift appears among the 36 gifts.   Gift 1 appears 4 times (since each of Carol's 4 friends gave her this gift). Gift 2 appears 5 times (since 5 of Carol's friends gave her this gift). Gift 3 appears 7 times (since 7 of Carol's friends gave her this gift). And so on... After analyzing the data, we can see that Gift 3 appears most frequently, with 7 instances. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Is there any gift that Carol received more than once?"" is Yes, and the gift that she received more than once is Gift 3."
"Response:  If Carol had $10 and she spent $7, then she has $3 left.  
If she gave $2 to her friend, then she would have $1 left."
Response:  We know that Carol had 14 apples and she gave 6 to her friend. So, how many apples does Carol have left?  14 - 6 = 8  Therefore, Carol has 8 apples left.
Response:  We know that Carol has 3 apples and she gives 2 to her friend. So, Carol is left with  3 - 2 = 1 apple. Now, if we want Carol to have 9 apples, we need to add 8 more apples to what she already has. Therefore, the number of apples Carol needs to buy is:  1 + 8 = 9.
Response:  We know that Melissa has 12 apples in total and each apple weighs 36 grams. So, if she has 12 apples, then she has 12 x 36 = 432 grams of apples in total.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 81 marks out of 100 in her examination and she got three questions wrong. So, we can start by finding out how many marks she scored correctly.   To find out how many marks Melissa scored correctly, we need to subtract the number of questions she got wrong from the total marks she scored. In this case, she got three questions wrong, so we subtract 3 from 81:  81 - 3 = 78 Therefore, Melissa scored 78 marks correctly.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 in one test and 82 in another test. To find out how many points she scored in the third test, we can use subtraction.   If Melissa scored 109 in the first test and 82 in the second test, then she must have scored less than 109 in the third test because she cannot score more than 109. So let's subtract 82 from 109 to find out how many points she scored in the third test:  109 - 82 = 27 Therefore, Melissa scored 27 points in the third test.
Response:  We know that there are 21 questions in total and each match has 7 questions. Therefore, we can calculate the number of matches as follows:  21 / 7 = 3 So, there will be 3 matches in total.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 91 points in each of the 13 games she played. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can multiply 91 by 13.  91 x 13 =?  Can you solve this multiplication problem and tell me the total number of points Melissa scored?
Response:  We have 20 people who can travel at different times. If we assume that each person takes an equal amount of time to travel (i.e., no one is faster or slower than anyone else), then we can represent this information using a permutation. Specifically, we need to arrange these 20 people in a line such that no two people start their journey at the same time. Since there are 20 people and each person needs to be placed in a unique position, we have 20! = 20 √ó 19 √ó 18 √ó... √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 2,432,901,765 possible arrangements. However, not all of these arrangements are valid since some people may end up starting their journeys at the same time. To account for this, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of valid arrangements, which we can calculate as follows: Valid arrangements: Each person can start their journey at any of the 20 available timeslots (since no one starts before the first person). Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is 20 √ó 19 √ó 18 √ó... √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 2,432,901,765. Total number of arrangements: We have already calculated this above as 2,432,901,765. Therefore, the probability of any particular arrangement being valid is: Probability = Number of valid arrangements / Total number of arrangements = 2,432,901,765 / 2,432,901,765 = 1. So, there is only one possible valid arrangement for the given scenario, and that is: Person 1 starts at time 1, Person 2 starts at time 2, and so on until Person 20 starts at time 20.
Response:  We know that there are 9 people in total and they will be divided into groups of 3 each. So, we can start by dividing 9 by 3 to get the number of groups:  9 / 3 =?  Now, we have 3 groups of people. Each group has 3 people, so we can multiply 3 by 3 to get the total number of people in each group:  3 x 3 =?  Finally, we need to find out how many people are left over after dividing the original 9 people into groups of 3. To do this, we can subtract the total number of people in each group from 9:  9 - (3 x 3) =?  Putting it all together, we get:  9 / 3 = 3  3 x 3 = 9  9 - (3 x 3) = 0  So, there is one person left over after dividing the original 9 people into groups of 3.
Response:  We know that there are 15 people in the group and they have to visit 20 places. So we can start by dividing 20 by 15 to find out how many groups of visitors each place will receive.  20 / 15 = 4  This means that each place will receive 4 groups of visitors. Now let's calculate how many visitors each place will receive in total. If each group has 15 people, then the total number of visitors per place is:  4 x 15 = 60  Therefore, each place will receive 60 visitors in total.
Response:  We know that there are 18 people in total and we need to find out how many of them can be seated at one table. Since each table can seat 10 people, we divide 18 by 10 to get the number of tables needed:  18 / 10 = 18/10 = 1 8 So, one table can accommodate 18 people.
Response:  We know that there are 16 people in total and we want to find out how many of them can fit in paradise. According to the problem statement, only 14 people can fit in paradise at a time. So, if we subtract 14 from 16, we get:  16 - 14 = 2 Therefore, two more people can go to paradise.
Response:  We know that there are two groups of people in paradise - those who will be punished for 14 days and those who will be punished for 54 days. So we can start by listing out all possible combinations of these two groups:   Group 1 (punished for 14 days):  0 people  1 person  2 people...  14 people Group 2 (punished for 54 days):  0 people  1 person  2 people...  54 people Now, let's look at each combination and see how many people are in total.  For group 1, there are 14 possible combinations:  0 people (no one is punished)  1 person (one person is punished)  2 people (two people are punished)...  14 people (14 people are punished) For each of these combinations, we need to calculate the number of people in group 2. To do this, we can use the fact that there are 54 people in group 2 and divide them equally among the 14 combinations:  0 people (no one is punished) : 0/14 = 0% of 54 people  1 person (one person is punished) : 1/14 = 7.14% of 54 people  2 people (two people are punished) : 2/14 = 14.29% of 54 people...  14 people (14 people are punished) : 14/14 = 100% of 54 people Now, let's add up all the percentages to find out the total number of people in both groups:  Total number of people in group 1 = 0 + 1 + 2 +... + 14 = 14 x 14 = 196 people Total number of people in group 2 = 0 x 54 = 0 + 7.14 x 54 = 380.71 + 14.29 x 54 = 799.16 +... + 100 x 54 = 5400 Total number of people in paradise = 196 + 380.71 + 
"Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of people in each paradise (viti vikubwa) and each group has 7 members (watu). So, in total, there are 3 x 7 = 21 people in each paradise. Now, we need to find out how many people can be accommodated in each group if there are 16 or 12 members in each group instead of 7.  
For 16 members per group: Each group would have 16 members, so there would be 3 x 16 = 48 people in each paradise.  For 12 members per group: Each group would have 12 members, so there would be 3 x 12 = 36 people in each paradise."
Response:  We have 16 people who want to split a reward of $4000 equally among themselves if they can solve the Paradiso puzzle in one month. If there are 4 weeks in a month, each person will receive...  4000/16 = $250 per week.
Response:  If there are four people who can finish one task in two hours, and each person works for half an hour, then they will complete half of the task in one hour. Therefore, if we need to complete two tasks in two hours, we can have four people work for one hour each, and they will complete both tasks. So, the number of people needed to complete two tasks in two hours is four.
Response:  We know that there are 7 tulips in total and each tulip has 5 petals. So, if we multiply 7 by 5, we get:  7 x 5 = 35 Therefore, there are 35 petals in total.
"Response:  If we have 28 people and each person wants to eat one pizza, then we need 28 pizzas.  
So, the answer is 28."
Response:  We know that there are 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, if we have 25 people eating pizza, how many slices of pizza will they get in total?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.  So, we can calculate as follows:   Total slices = Number of pizzas x Number of slices per pizza  Total slices = 17 x 4  Total slices = 68  Therefore, if 25 people eat pizza, they will get 68 slices of pizza in total.
Response:  If there are 9 mikates (mangoes) and each has 10 vipendes (seeds), then the total number of seeds is 9 x 10 = 90.   Now, if we have 2 people and each person gets half of the seeds, then each person will get 90/2 = 45 seeds.
Response:  We know that there are 10 mangoes in each basket and we have 45 baskets of mangoes. So, if we multiply 10 by 45, we get:  10 x 45 = 450. Therefore, there are 450 mangoes in total.
Response:  We know that there are 45 beads in total and they are distributed among 9 stands of varying lengths. Since each stand has at least one bead, we can start by finding out how many beads each stand has.  1) The first stand has 3 beads + 2 = 5 beads.   2) The second stand has 2 beads + 3 = 5 beads.    3) The third stand has 1 bead + 4 = 5 beads.     4) The fourth stand has 0 beads + 4 = 4 beads.    5) The fifth stand has 4 beads - 1 = 3 beads.    6) The sixth stand has 3 beads - 2 = 1 bead.    7) The seventh stand has 2 beads - 3 = 0 beads.    8) The eighth stand has 1 bead - 4 = 0 beads.    9) The ninth stand has 4 beads - 4 = 0 beads. Now let's add up all the beads in each stand to find out how many beads are left over: 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 23 beads. So, there are 23 beads left over after distributing all 45 beads among the nine stands.
Response:  We know that Paige has 36 eggs in total and she wants to distribute them equally among her 4 baskets. So, if we divide 36 by 4, we get:  36 √∑ 4 = 9 Each basket will have 9 eggs. Now, Paige also wants to add some extra eggs to each basket, so she adds 5 eggs to each basket. Therefore, the final number of eggs in each basket is:  9 + 5 = 14 eggs per basket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paige has 55 beads in total and she wants to divide them equally among five baskets. So, if we divide 55 by 5, we get:  55 √∑ 5 = 11 Each basket will have 11 beads. Now, Paige also wants to add some extra beads to each basket. She adds 15 beads to each basket, so the final number of beads in each basket is:  11 + 15 = 26 To find out how many beads Mangapi will have, we need to multiply the number of baskets (5) by the number of beads in each basket (26): Total beads for Mangapi = 5 x 26 = 130 Therefore, Mangapi will have 130 beads.
Response:  We know that there are 10 beds in each room and 60 guests in total. So we can start by dividing the number of guests by the number of rooms to find out how many guests will be accommodated in each room:  60 / 10 = 6 This means that each room will have 6 guests. Now let's calculate the number of beds that will not be used: Total number of beds - Number of beds used = Number of beds not used In this case, the total number of beds is 60, and the number of beds used is 6 x 10 = 60. Therefore, the number of beds not used is: 60 - 60 = 0 There will be no unused beds!
Response:  We know that there are 8 bags of flour in total and each bag weighs 32 kg. So, if we divide the total weight by the number of bags, we can find out how much each bag weighs.  8 x 32 = 256  Therefore, each bag of flour weighs 256 kg.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends one piece of candy, he would have given out 11 candies in total. So, if he had 20 pieces of candy and gave away 11, then he has  9 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Matthew has 8 friends and he wants to divide them equally into groups of 2, then we can start by dividing  8 by 2.   8 divided by 2 is 4 with no remainder. So, there will be 4 groups of 2 friends each. Now, let's see how many friends are in each group. We know that there are 8 friends in total, so if we divide 8 by 4 (the number of groups), we get:  8 / 4 = 2. So, each group has 2 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 apples and gave 5 to each of his 3 friends, how many apples would he have left?   First, let's calculate how many apples Matthew gives to each friend:  5 x 3 = 15 (Since there are 3 friends) Now, let's subtract the number of apples given away from the total number of apples Matthew had:  15 - 15 = 0 (Matthew has no apples left) Therefore, Matthew has no apples left after giving them away to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had $24 and gave $3 to each of his three friends, how much money would he have left?   First, let's calculate how much money Matthew gave to each friend:  3 x $3 = $9   So, Matthew gave $9 to each of his three friends. Now, let's calculate how much money Matthew has left:   $24 - $9 = $15   Therefore, Matthew has $15 left after giving $9 to each of his three friends.

Response:  If Matthew has 29 cookies and gives 2 to his friends, he will have  29 - 2 = 27 cookies left.    Now, if each cookie is shared equally among the remaining 2 friends, they will get  27 / 2 = 13.5 cookies each (since we cannot divide cookies into half, let's round up to 14 cookies each).
Response:  We know that Matthew has 14 cookies and wants to share them equally among his 7 friends. So, if he gives each friend an equal number of cookies, how many cookies will each friend get?   To find out, we can divide 14 (the total number of cookies) by 7 (the number of friends):  14 √∑ 7 =?   The result is:  14 √∑ 7 = 2   This means that each friend will get 2 cookies from Matthew.
Response:  If Alito had $18 and spent $36, then he has $18 - $36 = -$18. This means that Alito lost $18.   Therefore, if Alito had $36 and spent $18, he would have $36 - $18 = $18 left.
Response:  If Alito has 36 cookies and wants to share them equally among his 6 friends, how many cookies will each friend get?   To find out, we can divide 36 by 6:  36 √∑ 6 =?   The result is... 6! So each of Alito's friends will get 6 cookies.

Response:  We know that Matthew had $31 and gave $5 to his friends. So he has $31 - $5 = $26 left.   Now, we are asked how much money Matthew will have after buying something worth $23. To find out, we need to subtract $23 from what he has: $26 - $23 = $3.  Therefore, Matthew will have $3 left after buying something worth $23.
Response:  We know that there are 32 biscuits in total and each person will get 98% of them. So we can start by finding out how many biscuits each person will get.  98% of 32 is equal to 31.04 (round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, each person will get 31 biscuits.
Response:  We know that Alito has 10 cookies and wants to share them equally among 4 friends. So, if he gives each friend an equal number of cookies, how many cookies will each friend get?   To find out, we can divide 10 (the total number of cookies) by 4 (the number of friends): 10 √∑ 4 =? The result is: 10 √∑ 4 = 2 This means that each friend will get 2 cookies from Alito.
Response:  We know that there are 13 biscuits and 15 keys in total. If each person takes one key and one biscuit, how many pairs of keys and biscuits can be formed?   To find out, we need to divide the number of items into pairs. In this case, we have 13 + 15 = 28 items.  Since each pair consists of one key and one biscuit, we can form  28/2 = 14 pairs.  So, if each person takes one key and one biscuit, there will be 14 pairs in total.
Response:  If there are 109 days in total and we want to divide them into groups of 74 days each, then we can do so as follows:  109 days / 74 days per group = 1 group + 35 days remaining (since 109 cannot be divided evenly by 74) So, there will be one group of 74 days and 35 extra days left over.
Response:  If Debby has 153 weeks to finish her project and she spends 17 weeks on it, how many weeks will be left for her to complete the remaining tasks?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of weeks that Debby spent (17) from the total number of weeks available (153).  So, if we subtract 17 from 153, we get:  153 - 17 =?  The result is:  136  Therefore, Debby will have 136 weeks left to complete the remaining tasks.
Response:  We know that there are 264 days in a year and we want to find out how many times 15 can go into 264.  15 x 18 = 270 So, 15 goes into 264 exactly 270 times.
"Response:  If we have 301 days and each day has 24 hours, then we have 301 x 24 = 7244 hours in total.  
Now, if we want to know how many hours are between 144 and 157, we can subtract 144 from 157:  
157 - 144 = 13 So there are 13 hours between 144 and 157."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 88 days in May and 13 days in June. So if we subtract 13 from 88, we get:  88 - 13 = 75 days. Now, let's find out how many days are left for June to complete its 30 days. We can do this by dividing the remaining number of days (75) by the number of days in June (30):  75 / 30 = 2 1/2 months or 60 days. Therefore, there are 60 days left for June to complete its 30 days.
Response:  We know that there are 312 cups of water in the tank and each cup of water is equivalent to 256 milliliters (mL) of water. So we can start by converting the number of cups of water into liters:  312 cups x 256 mL/cup = 79,840 mL  Now we need to find out how many hours it would take for 79,840 mL of water to fill up a 4-liter container. To do this, we divide the volume of water in liters by the volume of the container in liters:  79,840 mL / 4 L = 19,960 hours  Therefore, if there were 312 cups of water in the tank and each cup of water was equivalent to 256 milliliters, it would take approximately 19,960 hours (or about 825 days) for all the water to flow out of the tank and fill up a 4-liter container.
Response:  If Debby has 6 cups of water and she needs to fill 12 cups for her plants, how many more cups does she need? To find out, we can subtract the number of cups she already has (6) from the total number of cups she needs (12):  12 - 6 = 6 So, Debby needs 6 more cups of water.
Response:  We know that for every 180 days of rain (maji), there are 54 days of dry weather (chupa). So if we want to find out how many days of dry weather there will be in 15 months (za soda), we can multiply 15 by 54 to get our answer.  15 x 54 = 810 Therefore, there will be 810 days of dry weather in 15 months.
Response:  We know that there are 360 degrees in a full circle and 162 degrees have passed. So, we can find out how many degrees are left by subtracting 162 from 360.  360 - 162 = 208 Therefore, there are 208 degrees left to complete the full circle. Now, if we want to find out how much time it will take for the remaining 208 degrees to be completed, we need to divide the number of degrees by the rate at which the degrees are being completed per unit of time (i.e., per hour). In this case, we know that each hour, 9 degrees are being completed (since there are 9 degrees in a full circle and 122 degrees have been completed in 9 hours). So, we can calculate the time as follows: Time = Number of degrees / Rate of completion per hour Time = 208 degrees / 9 degrees/hour Time = 23 hours Therefore, it will take 23 hours for the remaining 208 degrees to be completed.
Response:  We know that Faye has 14 pens in one safe and 11 pens in another safe. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  14 + 11 = 25 pens total.

Response:  We know that Faye has 7 pens and each pen can write 36 lines. So, in total, she has  7 x 36 = 252 lines.  Now we are told that she needs to write 30 lines for each of her safaris. Therefore, the number of safaris she can go on is  252 / 30 = 8.
Response:  We know that Faye has 11 pens and 31 pencils in total.  She also has 27 sheets of paper for each set of pens and pencils. So we can start by finding out how many sets of pens and pencils she has based on the number of sheets of paper she has.   To do this, we need to divide the total number of sheets of paper (27) by the number of sheets per set (2). This gives us:  27 / 2 = 13 sets of pens and pencils  Now that we know how many sets of pens and pencils Faye has, we can find out how many pens and pencils she has in total.  Since each set contains 1 pen and 3 pencils, we can multiply the number of sets by the number of items in each set to get the total number of pens and pencils:  13 x (1 + 3) = 13 x 4 = 52 pens and pencils  Therefore, Faye has 52 pens and pencils in total.
Response:  We know that each safe has 5 pensels and there are 30 safes in total. To find out how many pensels are needed in total, we can multiply the number of safes by the number of pensels in each safe:  30 x 5 = 150 pensels.
Response:  If Faye had 6 pencils and she gave 2 to her friend, then how many pencils would she have left?   We can use subtraction to find out.  6 - 2 =?  Can you solve for the number of pencils Faye would have left?
Response:  We know that Faye has 35 pens and each pen can hold 4 pens. So, if we multiply 35 by 4, we get:  35 x 4 = 140  Therefore, Faye needs to find a box that can hold 140 pens.
Response:  First, we know that Faye had 31 pens and gave 6 to her friend. So, she has  31 - 6 = 25 pens left.  Next, we know that each pen costs Ksh. 19. Therefore, the total amount of money Faye spent is:  25 x 19 = 475.  Finally, we are asked for the total number of pens Faye has. Since she spent all her pens, she doesn't have any more. So, the answer is:  0.
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 pens in box A and 71 pens in box B. She also has 24 pens in total. So we can start by adding the number of pens she has in each box:  30 + 71 = 101  Now we know that Faye has 101 pens in total. But wait! We were also given that she has 24 pens in total. So we need to subtract the number of pens she has in each box from the total number of pens she has:  101 - 24 = 77  Therefore, Faye has 77 pens in all.
Response:  We know that Faye has 16 pens and each pen can hold 6 ink cartridges. So, if we multiply 16 (pens) x 6 (ink cartridges per pen), we get 96 ink cartridges in total. However, Faye needs to use 21 ink cartridges for her art project. Therefore, she will need to buy  21 - 96 = 75 additional ink cartridges.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in the school and each class has 21 students. So, we can start by finding out how many classes there are in the school. To do this, we divide 98 by 21:  98 √∑ 21 = 4 Classes (remainder of 3) Now, we know that each class has 21 students, so we can find out how many students there are in total by multiplying the number of classes by the number of students in each class: 4 x 21 = 84 Students There are 84 students in the school. As for the remaining 3 students, they are left over from the division problem, and we know that there is one student left over in each of the four classes. Therefore, there are 3 students who are not accounted for in the previous calculation. These three students are the ones who have to share the extra vehicle.
Response:  We know that there are 84 students in the school and each class has 95 students. So, if we multiply 84 by 95, we get:  84 x 95 = 8060. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is 8060.
Response: 1) We have 66 students in each class of Madrasa 67.  2) If we divide 66 by 6 (the number of weeks in a term), we get 11 as our quotient and 0 with no remainder. This means that there are 11 full weeks in a term for each class.  3) Now, if we multiply 11 by 6 (the number of weeks in a term), we get 66, which is the same number of students in each class! So, the total number of students who can go on a trip is 66 x 6 = 396.
Response: 1) The number of students in each class is given as 58. 2) There are 87 classes in total. 3) We need to find out how many students there are in total. To do this, we multiply the number of students per class by the number of classes: 58 x 87 = 4964 students.
Response:  We know that there are 120 students in the school and each class has 24 students. So we can start by dividing 120 by 24 to find out how many classes there will be:  120 / 24 = 5 Now we need to find out how many teachers there will be. We know that each class has 84 books, so if there are 5 classes, there will be a total of 5 x 84 = 420 books. Since each teacher teaches one class, there will be 5 teachers in total. Therefore, the number of teachers is 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 102 students in the school and 8 teachers. So, if 22 students go on a trip, how many teachers will be left behind to teach the remaining students?   To find out, we can subtract the number of students who went on the trip (22) from the total number of students in the school (102): 102 - 22 = 80. Therefore, 8 teachers will be left behind to teach the remaining 80 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 students who will go on the trip and 99 students in total. So, if 8 students do not go on the trip, how many students will be left behind?  8 + 11 = 19 students will go on the trip.  99 - 19 = 80 students will be left behind.
Response:  We know that there are 72 students in the school and each class has 3 teachers. So, if we divide 72 by 3, we get 24. Now, if we have 111 students in total, and each class has 24 students, then we can say that there will be 4 classes (111/24 = 4). Therefore, the number of safaris required for all the students is 4.
Response:  We know that there are 46 classes in total and each class has 92 students, so we can start by calculating the total number of students:  46 x 92 = 4328. Now, let's calculate the average number of students per class:  4328 / 46 = 94. Finally, we can find out how many students are in each class by dividing the total number of students by the number of classes:  94 / 46 = 2.07 (approximately). So, there are approximately 2.07 students in each class.

Response:  If Haley has $23 and wants to buy 15 items that cost $1 each, how much change will she receive if she pays with her $23?   To find out, we can subtract the total cost of the items from the amount of money Haley has:   Change = Amount of money - Total cost of items  Change = $23 - $15 (15 x $1)  Change = $23 - $15  Change = $8  So, Haley will receive $8 in change if she pays with her $23 to buy 15 items that cost $1 each.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Darasani has Ksh. 13 and wants to buy a banana that costs Ksh. 50. So, she needs Ksh. 50 - Ksh. 13 = Ksh. 37 more shillings to buy the banana.  
Secondly, Haley has Ksh. 26 and wants to buy a mango that costs Ksh. 40. So, he needs Ksh. 40 - Ksh. 26 = Ksh. 14 more shillings to buy the mango.  
Lastly, if Darasani buys the banana, she will be left with Ksh. 13 - Ksh. 37 = Ksh. 5 less than what she had before. Similarly, if Haley buys the mango, he will be left with Ksh. 26 - Ksh. 14 = Ksh. 12 more than what he had before.  
Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Darasani has after buying the banana and the amount of money Haley has after buying the mango is:  
Ksh. 5 (Darasani has) - Ksh. 12 (Haley has) = Ksh. 7."
Response: 1. Firstly, we need to find out how many times each number appears in the list of numbers provided.  2. Next, we will add up all these numbers to get the total sum. 3.

To find out, let's subtract the smaller group from the larger group:  9 (in one group) - 9 =?  Now, we can see that we need to add 9 more cats to the other group to make them equal. Therefore, the answer is:  9.
Response:  We know that Philip has 140 - 187 = 47 marks less than the required marks. To find out how many marks he needs to get in order to pass, we need to subtract the number of marks he already has from the total marks. So, if he has 47 marks less, then he needs to get 47 marks more to pass. Therefore, the answer is 47.
Response:  We know that there are 203 students in total and 63 of them are in class 7. So, how many students are left to be distributed among classes 8-95? To find out, we subtract the number of students in class 7 from the total number of students:  203 - 63 = 140. Therefore, there are 140 students left to be distributed among classes 8-95.
Response:  We know that there are 142 students in class and 356 books in total. If each student is given 4 books, then how many books will be left over?   To find out how many books will be left over, we need to subtract the number of books given to each student from the total number of books. So, if each student gets 4 books, we can calculate how many books will be left over as follows: Total number of books - Number of books per student = 356 - 4 = 352 Books left over Therefore, there will be 352 books left over after each student is given 4 books.
Response:  We know that there are 392 items in total and we want to find out how many groups of 4 items can be formed using these items.   To do this, we will use the formula for combinations: C(n,k) = n! / (k! x (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items per group, and! denotes factorial.  In this case, n = 392, k = 4, so we can calculate the number of groups as follows: C(392,4) = 392! / (4! x (392-4)!). Using a calculator or computer algebra system, we get C(392,4) = 90720.  So there are 90720 groups of 4 items that can be formed using the 392 items.
Response:  If there are 180 items in total and we want to divide them equally among 5 groups, then each group will have:  180 / 5 = 36 items per group.
Response:  We know that there are 87 students in class 2 and 290 students in total.  If we divide 290 by 87, we get approximately 3.34. So, if one student from class 2 is randomly selected, there is about a 3.34% chance that they will be chosen as the representative for the entire school.
Response:  We know that there are 384 items in total and 192 of them belong to Philip. So, we can start by finding out how many items belong to the other person (not Philip).   To do this, we subtract the number of items belonging to Philip from the total number of items: Total items - Philip's items = Number of items belonging to the other person.  384 - 192 =?  The result is: 384 - 192 = 192. Therefore, there are 192 items belonging to the other person.
Response:  If there are 38 people and each person has 19 cookies, then together they have  38 x 19 = 742 cookies.
Response:  If Mama wa Brenda had 14 children and each child was given 30 sticks of candy, how many sticks of candy would she have in total?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of children by the number of sticks each child received:  14 x 30 = 420  So, Mama wa Brenda would have 420 sticks of candy in total.
Response:  We know that Mama gave 5 cookies to each of her children, so in total she gave out 5 x 3 = 15 cookies.   Now we are told that Brenda ate 22 cookies, but she only received 17 cookies from Mama, so we can set up the equation:  22 - 17 =?  To solve for the missing number, we need to find the difference between 22 and 17.  Can you do that?
Response:  We know that Mama gave 10 cookies to each of her 9 children, so she gave out 9 x 10 = 90 cookies in total. Now, if we add the number of cookies Brenda got (18) to the total number of cookies given out, we get:  90 + 18 = 108 cookies. So, Brenda got 18 cookies and the remaining 9 children shared the rest equally, meaning each child got 108 / 9 = 12 cookies. Therefore, Brenda got 18 cookies, and each of the other 9 children got 12 cookies.
Response:  If there are 14 people in total and each person has eaten at least 2 pieces of meat, then we can start by finding out how many pieces of meat were eaten in total.   To do this, we multiply the number of people by the number of pieces they have eaten:  14 x 2 = 28 pieces of meat.  Now, if each piece of meat is cut into 3 equal parts (mingapi), then we can calculate how many mingapi were eaten as follows:  28 / 3 = 9 mingapi.  So, there were 9 mingapi eaten in total.
"Response:  If Mama wa Brenda had 2 cookies and she gave one to each of her three children, how many cookies would each child get?  
If Mama wa Brenda has 10 cookies in total and gives two cookies to each of her three children, then each child will receive 2 x 3 = 6 cookies."
Response:  We know that Frank has 42 pencils in total and he wants to distribute them equally among 3 boxes. So, if we divide 42 by 3, we get:  42 / 3 = 14  Therefore, each box will have 14 pencils.
Response:  We know that Frank had $26 in his pocket and spent $33 on three items. So we can start by writing an equation to represent this information:  26 + 33 =?  Now we need to find out how much money Frank had after he bought the three items. To do this, we can subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had:  26 + 33 - 33 =?  This simplifies to:  26 + 0 =?  Finally, we can solve for the unknown quantity (in this case, the amount of money Frank had after buying the three items):  26 + 0 = 26  Therefore, the answer is:  Frank had $26 after buying the three items.
Response:  We know that Frank has 33 pencils and he gave away 24 of them. So, how many pencils does Frank have left? To find out, we can subtract 24 from 33:  33 - 24 =?  Yes, that's right! Frank has 9 pencils left.
Response:  If Frank had 11 pieces of candy and gave 2 to his friend, how many would he have left?  11 - 2 = 9 So, Frank would have 9 pieces of candy left.

Response:  We know that Shirley has 25 trefoils and each trefoil has 14 sides. So, if we multiply 25 by 14, we get:  25 x 14 = 350 Now we have our answer! There are 350 sides in total for all of Shirley's trefoils.
Response:  We have 10 - 5 =  5 remaining after subtracting 5 from 10.
Response:  We know that there are 67 students in class A and 9 students in class B. To find out how many more students are in class A than in class B, we need to subtract the number of students in class B from the number of students in class A.  67 - 9 =?  So, there are 58 more students in class A than in class B.
Response:  We know that there are 22 sodas of type A and 61 sodas of type B. To find out how many more sodas of type B there are than sodas of type A, we need to subtract the number of sodas of type A from the number of sodas of type B.  22 - 61 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 39 (61 - 22). So, there are 39 more sodas of type B than sodas of type A.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 students in class A and each student has to drink 8 glasses of water. So, the total number of glasses of water required for Class A is  30 x 8 = 240 glasses.  Next, we know that there are 41 students in Class B and each student has to drink 4 glasses of water. So, the total number of glasses of water required for Class B is  41 x 4 = 164 glasses.  Finally, we need to find out how many glasses of water are left after serving both classes. To do this, we subtract the total number of glasses of water required for Class B from the total number of glasses of water available (i.e., 240 - 164 = 76 glasses). Therefore, the remaining number of glasses of water after serving both classes is 76.
Response:  We know that Chupa 79 has 42 more than Soda ya Kawaida and Chupa 53 has 26 less than Soda ya Lishe. So we can start by finding out how many more or less Soda ya Kawaida is compared to Soda ya Lishe.   To find out how many more, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:   Soda ya Lishe - Soda ya Kawaida =?  Now let's do it!  53 - 79 =?   Answer:  53 - 79 = 26  So Soda ya Lishe is 26 less than Soda ya Kawaida.  Next, we need to find out how many more Soda ya Kawaida is compared to Chupa 53.  To do this, we add the difference we found earlier (26) to Chupa 53:   Chupa 53 + 26 =?   Answer:  53 + 26 = 79  So Chupa 53 is 26 more than Soda ya Kawaida.  Finally, we want to know how many more Soda ya Kawaida is compared to Chupa 79.  To do this, we subtract Chupa 53 from Chupa 79:   Chupa 79 - Chupa 53 =?   Answer:  79 - 53 = 26  So Soda ya Kawaida is 26 more than Chupa 79.
Response:  We know that chupa 54 is equal to 6 x 9 because 9 x 9 = 81 and we have subtracted 7 from 81 to get 54.   Similarly, we can find out that chupa 83 is equal to 6 x 12 because 12 x 12 = 144 and we have subtracted 7 from 144 to get 83. Now, we need to find out how many times 12 goes into 54. To do this, we divide 54 by 12. 54 / 12 =?  The result of this division is... 54 / 12 = 4 with a remainder of 0. This means that 12 goes into 54 exactly 4 times. So, if we multiply 12 by 4, we will get the number of units of soda that are needed to make up for the difference between chupa 54 and chupa 83.  Multiplying 12 by 4 gives us... 12 x 4 = 48. Therefore, we need 48 units of soda to make up for the difference between chupa 54 and chupa 83.
Response:  We know that there are 17 people in total and 9 of them drank soda. That means there are 8 people who did not drink soda. Now we need to find out how many of those 8 people drank lime juice. Since there were 29 matundas (fruits) altogether, and each person took at least one fruit, we can say that each non-drinker took 29/8 = 3 fruits each. So, there were 3 x 8 = 24 fruits taken by the non-drinkers. Therefore, there were 29 - 24 = 5 fruits left for the drinkers. Each drinker took at least one fruit, so they took 5/9 = 0.56 fruits each. Since there were 9 drinkers, they together took 0.56 x 9 = 4.94 fruits. However, since there were only 5 fruits left for the drinkers, it means that some of them did not get any fruits. In other words, the number of fruits that the drinkers received is less than or equal to 5. So, the maximum number of fruits that the drinkers could have received is 5. Therefore, the correct answer is: The drinkers received 5 fruits.
Response:  We know that we have 19 sodas of lime and 60 sodas of water. To make one liter of lime juice, we need to mix 19 sodas of lime with 41 sodas of water (since there are 4 liters in 100 sodas). Therefore, the number of sodas of water needed for 19 sodas of lime is:  41 sodas x 19 sodas = 789 sodas  So, we need more than 60 sodas of water to make 19 sodas of lime juice. The difference between the two amounts is:  60 sodas - 789 sodas = 729 sodas  Therefore, we need 729 sodas of water more than the amount of water we have to make 19 sodas of lime juice.
Response:  We know that there are 72 coins in total and we need to find out how many of them are not heads.   Firstly, let's count the number of heads:   Heads = 72 x (1/2) = 36   Now, let's subtract the number of heads from the total number of coins to get the number of tails:   Tails = 72 - 36 = 36   So, there are 36 tails.
Response:  We know that there are 36 students in class and each student has to drink either 80 or 54 ml of water. So we can start by listing all possible combinations of these two quantities:  80 + 54 = 134 ml (total amount of water)  Now let's find out how many cups of water each combination would require:  For 80 ml, we need 2 cups (80/50 = 2).  For 54 ml, we need 1 cup (54/50 = 1).  Therefore, the total number of cups required is:  2 + 1 = 3 cups.  So, if each student drinks either 80 or 54 ml of water, then 3 cups of water will be needed in total.
Response:  We know that there are 30 students in total and 28 of them have eaten their food (chupa). This means that only 2 students have not eaten their food (chupa). To find out who these two students are, we need to subtract the number of students who have eaten from the total number of students.   Total number of students = 30 Subtracting the number of students who have eaten = 30 - 28 = 2 Therefore, the two students who have not eaten their food (chupa) are numbers 2 and 3.
Response:  We know that duka la vyakula lilikuwa has 4 sodas of lisha. If we multiply this number by 79 (the difference between 79 and 4), we get:  4 x 75 = 300. So, the total amount of soda in the shop is 300 liters.
Response:  We know that there are 57 students in class 1 (chupa 57), and each student has brought 26 books of sugar (za soda ya lishe). So, in total, how many books of sugar have been brought to class 1?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of students by the number of books each student has brought:  57 x 26 =?  Can you solve this multiplication problem and tell me the result?
"Response:  We know that chupa 81 is made up of three parts:  
Chupa 60 for soda ya lishe + Chupa 60 for soda ya mwanga = Total of 120 units.  So, if we subtract the total number of units from the original quantity (chupa 81), we get:  
Chupa 81 - 120 =?  To find out how many units are left over after deducting the total number of units, we can simply subtract 120 from 81:  
81 - 120 =?  The result is:  
81 - 120 = 59  Therefore, there are 59 units left over after deducting the total number of units from chupa 81."
Response:  We know that the total number of cups is 49 + 40 + 6 = 95 cups.   Now we need to find out how many cups are for kawaida and lishe separately.  Since there are 49 cups for kawaida, each cup contains 49/6 = 8.17 liters (since there are 6 liters in a cup). Similarly, since there are 40 cups for lishe, each cup contains 40/6 = 6.67 liters. Finally, since there are 6 cups for mwanga, each cup contains 6/6 = 1 liter. So the volume of kawaida is 8.17 x 49 = 392.63 liters, the volume of lishe is 6.67 x 40 = 266.8 liters, and the volume of mwanga is 1 x 6 = 6 liters.
Response:  We know that there were initially 295 students in the class and 317 students attended the lesson at Buckingham Palace. So, we need to find out how many more students attended the lesson at Buckingham Palace compared to the initial number of students in the class. To do this, we can subtract the initial number of students (295) from the total number of students who attended the lesson (317):  317 - 295 = 22  Therefore, 22 more students attended the lesson at Buckingham Palace compared to the initial number of students in the class.
Response:  We know that there are 703 students in total and 246 of them attended on Wednesday. So, if we subtract 246 from 703, we get:  703 - 246 = 457 That means there were 457 students who did not attend on Wednesday. Now, we need to find out how many students will be attending on Saturday. If there are 25 days between Wednesday and Saturday, then each day has 246/25 = 9.84 students attending (rounded up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, on Saturday, there will be 9 + 9 +... + 9 = 9 x 25 = 225 students attending.
Response:  If there are 100 students in total and Rachel can do it in 666 minutes, then each student would take approximately  6.66 minutes to complete the task (666/100). So, if we have 666 students, they will take approximately  666 x 6.66 = 4372 minutes to complete the task (or approximately 73 hours).
"Response:  We know that there were 406 people who attended the event at Buckingham Palace in 327 days ago. To find out how many people will attend the event today, we need to subtract the number of days that have passed since then from the total number of days in 327 days.   Days = 327  
Now let's calculate the number of people who will attend the event today:   People = Total Number of People x (Days / Total Number of Days)  
People = 406 x (327 / 327)  
People = 406 x 1 = 406  
Therefore, if 327 days have passed since the last event at Buckingham Palace, 406 people are expected to attend today's event."
Response:  We know that there were 829 people who attended the funeral at Buckingham Palace in 185 years ago. If we subtract the number of people who attended the funeral last year (45), we get:  829 - 45 = 784. Therefore, 784 people attended the funeral at Buckingham Palace 185 years ago.
"Response:  We know that there were 557 people in Jumba la Buckingham and they left after 57 minutes. So, if we divide 557 by 57, we get approximately 9.6. Therefore, there were approximately 9.6 people leaving Jumba la Buckingham every minute.  
Now, let's find out how many people would have been leaving Jumba la Buckingham every second. To do this, we can multiply 9.6 by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). This gives us approximately 576 people leaving Jumba la Buckingham every second."
Response:  We know that there were initially 600 people in line for Buckingham Palace (Jumba la Buckingham).  üëâ After 2 hours, 661 people had joined the line (kulikuwa na picha 39 katika Jumba la Buckingham). So, how many more people joined the line during the last hour compared to the first hour? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people who joined the line during the first hour from the total number of people who joined the line during both hours. In other words, we need to subtract 600 from 661. Can you do that? Sure! Here's the calculation:  661 - 600 = 61  Therefore, 61 more people joined the line during the last hour than during the first hour.
Response:  We know that there are 92 students in total and they have to spend 419 minutes at the palace. So, if we divide 419 by 92, we get approximately 4.5 minutes per student. Now, we need to find out how many minutes each group of 103 students will spend at the palace. To do this, we can multiply 4.5 minutes per student by 103 students, which gives us approximately 467 minutes for the group of 103 students. Therefore, the group of 103 students will spend approximately 467 minutes at the palace before the other groups arrive.
Response:  We know that there were initially 512 people in the Buckingham Palace and after  89 years, only 471 people remained. So, we can start by subtracting 89 from 512 to find out how many people left the palace over time:  512 - 89 = 423 Now, we need to subtract again to find out how many people left the palace between the 80th and 89th year:  423 - 80 = 343 Therefore, 343 people left the palace between the 80th and 89th year.
"Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and we have to subtract the number of days Rachel spent at Buckingham Palace (705 days) from the total number of days in a year.  
So, the remaining number of days is:  
365 - 705 = 245 days."

Response:  If we have 557 grams of flour and we need to add 17 grams more to make one kilogram (which is equal to 1000 grams), then we can calculate how much more flour we need as follows:  1 kg - 557 g = 1000 g - 557 g = 443 g So, we need 443 grams more flour to reach one kilogram.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 items in the first list and each item has 492 units of weight. So, we can start by calculating the total weight of the first list as follows:   Total weight = (Number of items x Number of units per item)  Total weight = (11 x 492)  Total weight = 5308  Therefore, if we want to add the weights of both lists, we simply need to add the total weight of the first list to the total weight of the second list.  Total weight of both lists = Total weight of first list + Total weight of second list  Total weight of both lists = 5308 +?  To find out what the total weight of the second list is, we need to know how many items it contains and how much each item weighs. The problem states that there are ""many"" items in the second list, but it doesn't give us any information about their number or weight. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact total weight of the second list without additional information."
Response:  We know that Akiwa has 94 cows and each cow produces 90 liters of milk per day for six days a week. So, in total, how many liters of milk does Akiwa produce per week?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of cows by the amount of milk produced per day per cow. In this case, it would be:  94 cows x 90 liters/cow/day =? liters/week   Can you do the calculation and tell me the answer?
Response:  We know that there are  90 days in the year and each day has 24 hours. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows: Total hours = Number of days x Number of hours per day Total hours = 90 x 24 = 2160 hours So, there are 2160 hours in a year for irrigation purposes.
Response:  We know that Akiwa has 294 cows and each cow produces 244 liters of milk per day. That means the total amount of milk produced daily is  294 x 244 = 70,832 liters.  Now we are asked to find out how many pipas (pails) of milk Akiwa needs for 146 days.  To do this, we divide the total number of liters by the number of days:  70,832 / 146 = 485 pipas.  So, Akiwa needs 485 pipas of milk for 146 days.
Response:  We know that Akiwa has 235 cows and each cow produces 100 liters of milk per day. That means in total, Akiwa produces  235 x 100 = 23,500 liters of milk per day.  Now we are asked to find out how many pipas (pails) of milk Akiwa needs for 77 days. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of milk produced per day by the number of days she needs the milk to last. So let's divide 23,500 by 77:  23,500 / 77 = 308.5 pipas of milk per day.  Therefore, Akiwa needs 308.5 pipas of milk for 77 days.
Response:  We know that Akiwa has 252 cows and each cow produces 108 liters of milk per day. So, in total, Akiwa produces  252 x 108 = 26,944 liters of milk per day. Now, we need to find out how much milk Akiwa will produce in one week (7 days). To do this, we multiply the daily production by 7:  26,944 x 7 = 187,632 liters of milk per week. Finally, to get the amount of milk Akiwa will produce in 57 weeks (the number of weeks in a year), we multiply the weekly production by 57:  187,632 x 57 = 10,742,864 liters of milk per year.
Response:  We know that Akiwa needs to fill 36 pipes with water every day and each pipe can hold 8 liters of water. So, in total, she needs to fill  36 x 8 = 288 liters of water every day. Since there are 1000 milliliters in one liter, we can convert this amount to  288,000 milliliters (mL) per day. Now, we need to find out how many days she can fill 240 pipes with this amount of water. To do this, we divide the number of pipes by the number of days she can fill them:  240 pipes / 288,000 mL per day = approximately 833 days or just over 2 years.
Response:  We know that there are 26 boys in total and each group has 52 boys. So, if we divide 26 by 52, we get:  26 / 52 = 0.5 or 50% of the boys are in each group. Therefore, there are 50% of 26 boys in each group, which is 13 boys per group.
"Response:  We know that there are 40 cows in total and each cow has two calves. So we can start by finding out how many groups of two calves there are in 40 cows.   To do this, we divide 40 by 2 (the number of calves per group):  40 √∑ 2 =?  The result is:  40 √∑ 2 = 20   This means there are 20 groups of two calves in 40 cows. Now let's find out how many calves there are in total. Since each group has two calves, we multiply the number of groups by 2 (the number of calves per group):  20 x 2 =?  The result is:   20 x 2 = 40   This means there are 40 calves in total. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many calves does each cow have?"" is 2."
Response:  We know that Pia has 56 cows and 10 calves. If each cow gives birth to three calves, then Pia has 56 x 3 = 168 calves in total. Since she already has 10 calves, we subtract 10 from 168 to get the number of calves born by her cows:  168 - 10 = 158. Therefore, Pia has 158 calves born by her cows.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 74 cows for milk and 22 cows for meat. Total number of cows = 74 + 22 = 96. Now we are asked to find out how many cows he has in his farm. To do this, we subtract the number of cows he has for meat from the total number of cows. Number of cows in the farm = Total number of cows - Number of cows for meat. Number of cows in the farm = 96 - 22 = 74. Therefore, Tyler has 74 cows in his farm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 cows for every 100 liters of milk produced by the dairy farm, and 62 cows for every 100 liters of safe water produced by the water treatment plant. Therefore, if we want to find out how many cows are needed to produce 19 liters of safe water, we need to convert 19 liters to 100 liters.  19 liters is equal to 0.19 x 100 = 190 liters. Now, we can use the ratio to find out how many cows are needed to produce 190 liters of safe water: 190 liters / 100 liters per 62 cows = 3 cows. Therefore, three cows are needed to produce 19 liters of safe water.

Response:  If there are six houses in a row and each house has two windows facing the street, then there will be a total of 12 windows facing the street (2 x 6 = 12).   Now, if we assume that each window is open for 24 hours a day, then there will be a total of 24 x 12 = 288 open windows during the day. However, since each window can only be open for 24 hours at a time, this means that there will actually be a total of 288 / 24 = 12 open windows at any given time.
Response:  We have  14 houses in total and each house has two rooms. So we need to find out how many rooms are there in total.  14 x 2 = 28 rooms. Therefore, there are 28 rooms in total.
Response:  We know that there are 20 houses in each village and we want to distribute 32 bags of cement among them. Since each bag of cement can be shared among two houses, we need to divide 32 by 2 to find out how many bags each house will get.  32 √∑ 2 = 16 So, each house will receive 16 bags of cement.
Response:  We know that there are 78 barrels in total and each barrel contains 30 liters of water. So we can start by calculating how many barrels it would take to fill one house with 19 cubic meters of water.   To do this, we need to convert 19 cubic meters from meters to liters. There are 1000 liters in 1 cubic meter, so:  19 cubic meters x 1000 liters/cubic meter = 19,000 liters   Now we know that each barrel holds 30 liters, so we can divide the total number of liters needed (19,000) by the number of liters per barrel (30):  19,000 liters / 30 liters/barrel = 633 barrels   Therefore, it would take approximately 633 barrels to fill one house with 19 cubic meters of water.
Response:  We know that there are 8 bars in total and each bar has 55 beads.  So, we can start by adding up all the beads in each bar to find out how many beads there are in total:  8 x 55 = 440 beads. Now, let's look at the problem from another angle. If each bar has 55 beads, then there must be 32 beads in each of the 8 bars, since 32 x 8 = 256 beads. Therefore, there are 256 beads in total.
Response:  We know that there are 81 houses in total and each house has 12 rooms. So we can start by finding out how many rooms there are in total:  12 x 81 = 972 rooms Now we need to find out how many bars of soap are needed for each room. Since there are 4 bars of soap per box, we divide the number of rooms by 4:  972 / 4 = 243 boxes of soap needed.
Response:  We have 16 bars in total and each bar has 4 spaces for beads. Therefore, we can fill up to 64 beads in total (16 x 4). However, if there is an extra bar with 17 spaces, we can add another 17 beads to the total count, bringing it to 81 beads (64 + 17).
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 apples and she gives 20 to her friend. So, how many apples does Rebecca have left after giving some to her friend?

Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 chickens and each chicken lays 1 egg per day, so she has 4 eggs in total.   Now we are told that she gives 2 eggs to her neighbor, leaving her with 2 eggs.  Therefore, the number of eggs Rebecca has is 2.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of students in class 6. We know that there are 18 boys and 72 girls in the class, so the total number of students is:  18 + 72 = 90  Next, we need to find out how many students have more than 66 marks. To do this, we need to subtract 66 from each student's score and see who has a positive result. For example, if a student scored 75, we would subtract 66 from 75 to get:  75 - 66 = 9 So, the student with a score of 75 has more than 66 marks. Similarly, we can check the scores of all the other students. Based on the information given, here are the results:  Boy Scores: 18 - 66 = -48 (negative) Girl Scores: 72 - 66 = 6 (positive) Therefore, only one girl has more than 66 marks, and her name is Rebecca. The correct answer is: Rebecca.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of points that Rebecca has scored so far. We know she has scored 99 points in the first two rounds. So, her total score is:  99 + 9 = 108 points. Next, we need to subtract the points she lost (27) from her total score:  108 - 27 = 81 points. Therefore, Rebecca has 81 points left to play with in the final round.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 maize cobs and she wants to share them equally among 6 people. So, if we divide 20 by 6, we get:  20 √∑ 6 = 3 Each person will receive 3 maize cobs from Rebecca.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 oranges and she gives 3 to her friend. So, how many oranges does Rebecca have left?  5 - 3 = 2  Therefore, Rebecca has 2 oranges left.
Response:  We know that there are 154 questions in total and each round has 11 questions. So, if we divide 154 by 11, we get:  154 √∑ 11 = 14 With one round left over.
Response:  We have 177 questions in total and each round has 46 questions. So we can calculate the number of rounds as follows:  177 / 46 = 4 To find out how many questions are left after completing four rounds, we multiply the remaining questions by the number of questions per round:  177 - (4 x 46) = 177 - 184 = 93 Therefore, there would be 93 questions left after completing four rounds.
"Response:  We know that Luke has 84 questions in total and he wants to divide them into two groups of 42 each for two different exams. So we can start by dividing 84 by 2:  84 / 2 =?  
Now we have our first result:  84 / 2 = 42. This means that Luke has 42 questions for each exam. But wait, there's more! Since Luke also wants to make sure that each group of questions is balanced, we need to find out how many questions are left over after dividing 84 by 2. To do this, we can subtract the quotient (result of division) from the dividend (number being divided):  84 - 42 =?  
So what's the result?  84 - 42 =?  
Great job! Now you have all the information you need to determine how many questions Luke will have for each exam."

Response: 1st step is to calculate the number of friends that Emily has. We know she has 2 close friends and each friend has 4 common friends, so the total number of common friends =  2 x 4 = 8. Therefore, Emily has 8 friends in total (2 close friends + 8 common friends). Now we need to find out how many more friends Emily needs to make to reach her target of 32 friends. To do this, we subtract the number of friends she already has from her target: 32 - 8 = 24. So Emily needs to make 24 more friends to reach her target.
"Response: 
Emily had 11 friends and each friend gave her $28. So she received a total of  
11 x $28 = $308."
Response:  To find out how many trips Emily needs to make with her car to transport all of her friends, we need to divide the total distance traveled by each friend by the distance that can be covered in one trip.   First, let's calculate the total distance traveled by all of Emily's friends: Total distance = (8 x 10) + (16 x 20) = 80 + 320 = 400 km. Next, we need to determine how far Emily's car can travel in one trip. We are given that she has a small car, so let's assume it can cover a maximum distance of 20 km per trip. Now, we can calculate the number of trips Emily needs to make: Number of trips = Total distance / Distance per trip Number of trips = 400 km / 20 km Number of trips = 20 trips. So, Emily needs to make 20 trips to transport all of her friends.
Response:  To find out how many trips are needed to transport all the friends using the truck with a capacity of 18 people, we need to divide the total number of passengers (6 + 18 = 24) by the capacity of the truck (18).  24 / 18 = 3 So three trips will be needed to transport all the friends using the truck with a capacity of 18 people.

Response:  To find out how many trips Emily needs to make in total, we need to first calculate how many trips she will make for each batch of 6 books.   For the first batch of 6 books, Emily will make 6 trips because there are 6 books in that batch.  For the second batch of 6 books, Emily will make 3 trips (since there are only 3 books left). Therefore, the total number of trips Emily needs to make is:  6 + 3 = 9 trips.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emily has 43 friends and she wants to divide them into groups of 5 or fewer people. So, we can start by finding out how many groups of 5 or fewer people Emily can make with her 43 friends.   To do this, we will use division. We will divide 43 (the total number of friends) by 5 (the desired group size).  Here's the calculation:  43 √∑ 5 =?  Can you solve for the quotient (result of the division)?  Hint: You may need to use a calculator or your mental math skills!

Response:  We know that there are 907,611 children in total and 455,682 of them go to school. So, we can find out how many children do not go to school by subtracting 455,682 from 907,611.  907,611 - 455,682 =?  The result is 451,929. Therefore, 451,929 children do not go to school in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that there are 800059 children in need of sponsorship and 828521 total children in the county of Lawrence. To find out how many children will be left without sponsorship if all the children in the county are sponsored, we can subtract the number of sponsored children from the total number of children in the county.  828521 - 800059 = 284612. Therefore, if all the children in the county of Lawrence are sponsored, 284612 children will be left without sponsorship.
Response:  We know that there are 61,619 children in Lawrence County who have been affected by the floods. This is out of a total population of 91,676 people in the county. To find out how many children were not affected by the floods, we can subtract the number of affected children from the total population:  91,676 - 61,619 = 30,057. Therefore, there are approximately 30,057 children in Lawrence County who were not affected by the floods.
Response:  Firstly, we have 34,044 children from county Lawrence who are orphans and vulnerable. Secondly, there are 134,867 children in total from all counties who are also orphans and vulnerable. Lastly, there are 424,944 children from all counties who are not orphans and vulnerable. Therefore, to get the total number of children who are orphans and vulnerable plus those who are not, we add up all these numbers as follows:  34,044 + 134,867 + 424,944 = 593,855. So, the total number of children in need of assistance is 593,855.
Response:  We know that there are 610769 people in the county of Lawrence and 590796 people have been vaccinated at home. This means that there are  22,000 (610769 - 590796) unvaccinated people in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children in total and they come from 893835 households. This means that each household has an average of approximately 7.2 children (644997 / 893835). Now we need to find out how many households have exactly 7 children. To do this, we can use a simple probability calculation. Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is having exactly 7 children, and the total number of outcomes is all possible combinations of children per household. Since there are 8 children in total, there are 8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 40,320 possible combinations. Therefore, the probability of having exactly 7 children is: Probability = 40,320 / 893835 ‚âà 0.0045 or 0.45% So, about 0.45% of households have exactly 7 children. Now, let's calculate the number of households with exactly 7 children: Number of households with exactly 7 children = Probability x Total number of households = 0.45% x 893835 ‚âà 39,999 households Have exactly 7 children. Therefore, the number of households with exactly 7 children in the county of Lawrence is approximately 39,999.

Response:  We know that Adam has 9 more points than Jackie and Adam has 8 more points than Jackie. So we can start with these two equations:  9 = x + 8... where x is the number of points Jackie has. Solving for x, we get:  x = 17 Now we know that Jackie has 17 points. Therefore, Adam has 9 more points than Jackie, which means Adam has 17 + 9 = 26 points.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 marbles and Adam has 6 more than Jackie. So, Adam has 10 + 6 = 16 marbles. Now, we are told that both players want to have 2 marbles each. Therefore, Adam must give 16 - 2 = 14 marbles to Jackie. Finally, Jackie has 10 + 14 = 24 marbles, and Adam has none left.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 89 points and needs 11 more points to reach 100 points.  Now, we need to find out how many points Adam needs to catch up with Jackie.   To do this, we subtract Jackie's points from Adam's points:  89 (Jackie) - x (Adam) = 11 (difference between their scores)  Since Adam is behind Jackie by 11 points, he needs to score at least 11 points more than Jackie to catch up. Therefore, Adam needs 11 + 89 = 100 points.  So, Adam needs 100 points to catch up with Jackie.

Now, let's consider the second part of the problem. If she gives 484 chocolates to her friend, how many more chocolates will she have left after giving away all the groups of 51? To find out, let's subtract the number of chocolates in each group from the total number of chocolates:  484 - (176 x 51) =?   The result is:  484 - (176 x 51) = 484 - 8920 = -3484   Since the result is negative, it means that Helen will not have any chocolates left after giving away all the groups of 51. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Mikate mingapi ya chokoleti ni 51.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has 527 cookies and she gives 86 of them to her friend. So, how many cookies does Helen have left?  527 - 86 =?  527 - 86 = 441  Now, we are told that Helen also gives 86 cookies to her friend today. So, how many cookies does Helen have now?  441 - 86 =?  441 - 86 = 355  Therefore, the number of cookies Helen has is 355.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has 144 cookies and 397 crackers.  Secondly, she has 85 crackers and 403 cookies today morning. Now, let's calculate how many crackers and cookies Helen will have in total if she doesn't eat any of them. Total number of crackers = 144 + 85 = 229 Total number of cookies = 397 + 403 = 799 Therefore, Helen will have 229 crackers and 799 cookies in total if she doesn't eat any of them.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has 19 pieces of chocolate and 231 pieces of candy. Next, we need to find out how many more pieces of candy Helen has than chocolates. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolates from the total number of candies:  231 - 19 = 212. So, Helen has 212 pieces of candy more than she has chocolates. Now, let's convert both numbers to their respective percentages: Percentage of chocolates = (19/212) x 100% = 8.5% Percentage of candies = (212/212) x 100% = 100% Therefore, Helen has 8.5% chocolates and 100% candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen has eaten 197 cookies and 46 bars of chocolate in total.   Secondly, she has eaten 75 bars of chocolate today morning. Thirdly, she has not eaten any cookies this morning. Now let's calculate how many more cookies Helen needs to eat to reach her daily target of 200 cookies. We can do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars she has eaten (75) from her total cookie count (197). This gives us: 197 - 75 = 122 So, Helen needs to eat 122 more cookies to reach her daily target of 200 cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen consumed 519 cookies and 300 candies in total.   Secondly, she consumed 280 candies and 359 cookies today morning. So, if we subtract the number of candies and cookies she consumed this morning from the total amount she had yesterday, we get:   Total cookies yesterday - Today's cookies = 519 - 280 = 239   Total candies yesterday - Today's candies = 300 - 359 = -59   Therefore, Helen has 239 cookies and -59 candies left.
"Response:  We know that Katie has $81 and her friends have $59. To find out how much more money Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract $59 from $81.  
$81 - $59 =?  The difference is $22. So Katie has $22 more than her friends."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michezo 91 has 91 points and Marafiki Zake has 88 points. So, if we subtract 88 from 91, we get:  91 - 88 = 3 Now, let's consider the third player who scored 53 points. If we add 53 to 3, we get:   3 + 53 = 56 Therefore, the total number of points for all three players is 56.
"Response:  We know that Katie and her friends are all musicians who have been playing their instruments for different numbers of years.  1. Michezo 78 means ""playing an instrument for 78 years."" So if Katie has been playing for 78 years, she must have started when she was born! That's because babies don't play musical instruments, so we can assume that Katie began playing when she grew up enough to handle one.  2. Now let's look at Michezo 86. This phrase means ""playing an instrument for 86 years."" If Katie has been playing for 86 years, then she must have started playing when she was much older than when she first learned how to walk or talk. In fact, she probably started playing when she was already grown up and able to take care of herself!  3. Finally, let's consider Michezo 48. This phrase means ""playing an instrument for 48 years."" If Katie and her friends have been playing together for 48 years, then they must have met each other sometime around age 40 (since they all started playing at different ages). Since Katie is now 78 years old (according to Michezo 78), she must have met her friends about 30 years ago (when she was only 48 years old)! Therefore, based on these clues, we can conclude that Katie and her friends have known each other since they were both middle-aged adults - which makes sense given their shared love of music!"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie and her friends are all musicians who have been playing their respective instruments for different periods of time. We can represent this information using numbers as follows:  
Katie has been playing the piano for 84 months (7 years). Her friends have been playing their instruments for the following lengths of time:  
Friend A has been playing the guitar for 8 months. Friend B has been playing the violin for 69 months (5.75 years). Now, let's find out how long ago each friend started playing their instrument compared to Katie. To do this, we need to subtract the length of time each friend has been playing from the number of months Katie has been playing. Here's the calculation for each friend:  
For Friend A: 8 - 84 = -76 months (or -6 years) For Friend B: 69 - 84 = -15 months (or -1 year and 3 months) So, Friend A started playing the guitar 6 years and 3 months before Katie started playing the piano, while Friend B started playing the violin 1 year and 3 months before Katie started playing the piano."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie is older than her sister by 2 years and 9 months (michezo 62 - michezo 80 = 18).   Secondly, their parents are also older by 2 years and 5 months (michezo 73 - michezo 41 = 32). Therefore, if we subtract the age of the parents from the difference between Katie and her sister's ages, we get:  18 - 32 = -14  This means that Katie is 14 years younger than her sister.
Response:  We know that Katie had 57 points and her friend had 63 points in their game of DS. To find out how many more points Katie's friend had than her, we need to subtract 57 from 63.  63 - 57 =?  16  So, Katie's friend had 16 more points than she did.
Response: 1) Katie has been married for 57 years and her husband passed away 39 years ago.  2) Her friends have been married for 34 years. To find out how many more years Katie has been married than her friends, we need to subtract 34 from 57.  57 - 34 = 23 So, Katie has been married for 23 more years than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19. Secondly, we are told that after some time, Jason has $33. So, let's find out how much money did Jason have before he received any amount from Fred.   Thirdly, we can deduce that Jason gave some amount of money to Fred because otherwise, there would be no reason for Fred to give him anything. Therefore, we need to subtract the amount that Jason gave to Fred from his initial amount of $19. Lastly, we will add the remaining amount that Fred gave to Jason to find out how much money Jason currently has.  Based on these steps, here is the calculation:   Initial Amount of Jason = $19   Amount given by Jason to Fred =? (Let's assume it's x)   Remaining amount with Fred = $60 - x   New Amount of Jason = $19 + ($60 - x)   Solving for x, we get:   x = $41   Therefore, Jason initially had $41 and gave $41 to Fred.   Now, let's calculate the new amounts of both Fred and Jason:   New Amount of Fred = $60 - $41 = $19   New Amount of Jason = $19 + $41 = $33
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 and Jason had $5. So together they had $86 + $5 = $91. Now, if Fred spent $9, he would have $86 - $9 = $77. And if Jason spent $4, he would have $5 - $4 = $1. Therefore, together they have $77 + $1 = $78.  
So, currently, they have $78."
"Response:  We know that Fred is currently 40 years old and Jason is 69 years old.  If they were both born on the same day of the week (let's say Wednesday), then:  
Fred was born on a Wednesday when he was 19 years old (20 years ago)  Jason was born on a Wednesday when he was 16 years old (33 years ago) Now, let's calculate how much money each of them had at their respective ages:  
When Fred was 19 years old, he had $19 (since he is now 40 years old and has been working for 21 years). When Jason was 16 years old, he had $16 (since he is now 69 years old and has been working for 53 years). So, the difference in the amount of money that Fred and Jason had at their respective ages is:  
$19 - $16 = $3  Therefore, Fred had $3 more than Jason did at their respective ages."
"Response:  First, we know that Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. Next, we know that Fred gave some money to Jason, so now Fred has $21 and Jason has $78. Finally, we want to find out how much money Jason gained from Fred. To do this, we need to subtract what Fred has ($21) from what Jason has ($78):  
$78 - $21 = $57  So, Jason gained $57 from Fred."
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $111 and Jason had $40.  Next, we know that Fred spent some money and now has $115.  Finally, we know that Jason increased his amount of money by some amount and now has $44.   So let's start with what Fred had:  111 + x = 115 (where x is the amount Fred spent)  Now, let's add what Jason had:  40 + y = 44 (where y is the amount Jason increased by)  We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how much each one spent or gained:  111 + x = 115  40 + y = 44  Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:  71 = x + y  Since we are trying to find out how much each person spent or gained, we will set up two inequalities based on the given information:   x > 0 (Fred spent more than zero)   y > 0 (Jason gained more than zero)  Now we can substitute the values we found into the inequality:  71 = x + y  Since we know that both people spent/gained positive amounts, we can rewrite the inequality as:  71 >= x + y  Simplifying further gives us:  35 <= x <= 39  2 <= y <= 6  Therefore, Fred spent between $35 and $39, and Jason gained between $2 and $6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Juma had $49 and gave $3 to Jason. So, Juma has $49 - $3 = $46 left.   Secondly, we are told that Juma spent $112. Therefore, Juma now has $46 - $112 = $-66. Finally, we are asked how much money did Jason get from selling the newspaper. We know that Jason received $3 from Juma. So, Jason has $3.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $78 and Jason had $31. Secondly, we are given that Jason spent $14 to buy a magazine. Thirdly, we know that Fred gave him some money so that he could buy the magazine. Therefore, let us calculate how much Fred gave to Jason. We can do this by subtracting the amount Jason spent from the amount Fred had before giving any money to Jason. So, if Fred had $78 and gave some money to Jason, then the amount Fred had after giving the money to Jason would be:  
$78 - $14 = $64  Now, we need to find out how much Fred gave to Jason. To do this, we will divide the amount Fred had after giving the money to Jason by the amount Jason spent:  
$64 √∑ $14 = 4  Therefore, Fred gave $4 to Jason."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 and Jason had $95. Secondly, when they went to buy groceries, Fred spent $16 and Jason spent $74. So, how much money did each of them have after buying groceries?  
For Fred:  
$33 - $16 = $17 (Fred had $17 left after buying groceries)  
For Jason:  
$95 - $74 = $21 (Jason had $21 left after buying groceries)"
"Response:  First, we know that Fred had $47 and Jason had $99.  Next, we are told that Fred spent $111 and received $34. So, let's subtract what he spent from his original amount to find out how much money he has left:  
$47 - $111 = -$64 (Fred owes $64) Now, let's add the $34 he received to see how much money he has in total:  $-64 + $34 = $28 (Fred has $28) Therefore, Fred currently has $28."
Response:  If Jesse weighed 71 kg initially and lost 20 kg, then she currently weighs:  71 - 20 = 51 kg.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie gained 34 kg (101 - 67 = 34). Second, we know that she lost 27 kg (27 is the difference between her current weight and her previous weight of 67 kg). So, if we subtract 27 from 34, we get:  34 - 27 = 7  Therefore, Jessie gained 7 kg more than she lost.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 126 pounds. That means she started at 252 pounds (126 + 126 = 252). Now, she weighs 66 pounds less than that, so her current weight is:  252 - 66 = 186 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie gained 35 kg. So, her current weight is 69 + 35 = 104 kg. Now, if she lost 20 kg, her new weight would be 104 - 20 = 84 kg. Therefore, the final weight of Jessie is 84 kg.
"Response:  If Jesse weighed 114 kg initially and lost 50 kg in the first week, then she would have weighed 114 - 50 = 64 kg at the end of the first week.  
If she lost another 60 kg in the second week, then she would have weighed 64 - 60 = 4 kg at the end of the second week. Therefore, Jesse currently weighs 4 kg."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie gained 9 kg in total. Secondly, she lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week. Therefore, to find out how much weight Jessie had before losing any weight, we need to subtract the amount of weight she lost in both weeks from her total weight gain of 9 kg.  9 kg - (62 kg + 140 kg) = 9 kg - 202 kg = -193 kg So, Jessie had a starting weight of approximately -193 kg before losing any weight.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie lost 36 kg (92 - 56 = 36). Secondly, we are asked to find out how much she lost per week. To do this, we need to divide the total weight loss (36 kg) by the number of weeks she lost weight (2 weeks). So,  36 kg / 2 weeks = 18 kg/week. Therefore, Jessie lost 18 kg per week.
Response:  We know that there are 95 zebras and 61 lions in the zoo. If we subtract the number of lions from the total number of animals, we get:  95 + 61 = 156 - 64 = 92 animals left.  So, if 64 lions were removed, there would be 92 animals left in the zoo.
Response:  We know that there were 93 zebras and 97 lions in the zoo. If 40 of the mambas (M) died, we can find out how many mambas are left by subtracting 40 from 97.  97 - 40 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 57 mambas left.
Response:  We know that there were 3 zebras and 75 mambas in total. If we subtract the number of zebras (3) from the total number of animals (82), we get:  82 - 3 = 79. Now, if we subtract the number of mambas (19) from the remaining animals (79), we get:  79 - 19 = 60. Therefore, there were 60 animals left after the zebras and mambas had been accounted for.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total at the zoo. Of these, 24 are zebras and 51 are monkeys. To find out how many animals of each species are left after some have been eaten by lions and snakes, we need to subtract the number of lions and snakes from the total number of animals.   If there were no lions or snakes, then all 79 animals would be safe. However, since there are both lions and snakes present, let's assume that each lion eats 3 zebras (since there are 8 lions) and each snake eats 2 monkeys (since there are 10 snakes). Therefore, the number of zebras eaten by lions is 3 x 8 = 24, and the number of monkeys eaten by snakes is 2 x 10 = 20. Now, let's subtract these numbers from the total number of animals to find out how many animals of each species are left: Total animals - Zebras eaten by lions = 79 - 24 = 55 Left zebras = 55 Right monkeys = 79 - 20 = 59 Left monkeys = 59 So, after the lions and snakes have finished eating, there will be 55 zebras and 59 monkeys left at the zoo.
Response:  We know that Mkulima had 171 chickens at first and then lost 30 chickens during the 134 days. So, how many chickens does Mkulima have now?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of chickens lost from the total number of chickens Mkulima had initially.   Total number of chickens = 171   Number of chickens lost = 30   Therefore, the number of chickens left with Mkulima = Total number of chickens - Number of chickens lost   = 171 - 30   = 141   So, Mkulima has 141 chickens left after losing 30 chickens over 134 days.
Response:  We know that Mkulima had 160 cows in her farm and she sold 56 cows last week. So, how many cows does she have left now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cows she sold from the total number of cows she had. Total number of cows = 160 - 56 = 104. Therefore, Mkulima has 104 cows left in her farm.
Response:  We know that Mkulima had 90 chickens in his farm at Lake Victoria and he sold 154 chickens last week. So, if we subtract the number of chickens he had from the number of chickens he sold, we will get the net increase in the number of chickens he has.   Net Increase = Number of Chickens Sold - Number of Chickens Had  Net Increase = 154 - 90  Net Increase = 64  Therefore, Mkulima now has 64 more chickens than he had before selling 154 chickens.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 175 cows and 77 goats in his farm. If he sold 172 cows, how many goats will he have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cows he sold from the total number of cows he had:  175 - 172 =?  Go ahead and calculate the answer.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mkulima had 177 cows and 12 calves in his farm. If he sold 53 cows, how many cows does he have left? To find out, we can subtract 53 from 177.  177 - 53 =?  The answer is 124. So, Mkulima has 124 cows left after selling 53.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mkulima has 105 chickens and 71 ducks in his farm. If he adds 137 more chickens to his existing stock, how many birds will he have altogether?   To find out, let's add the number of chickens he already has (105) to the new number of chickens he is adding (137): 105 + 137 =?  Can you solve for the total number of chickens Mkulima will have?
"Response:  We know that John wants to buy 4 pieces of furniture for his new house and each piece costs $200. So he needs to spend $800 in total (4 x $200). Now we are given that he has $1500 with him. So he will have enough money to buy all the four pieces of furniture because $1500 is greater than $800.  
Therefore, the number of pieces of furniture John can buy is 4."
Response:  To find out how many bricks are needed for each row of the wall, we need to divide the total number of bricks required (17) by the number of rows (8).  17 √∑ 8 = 2 So, there will be 2 rows of bricks. Now, let's calculate the number of bricks needed for each row: 2 x 9 = 18 bricks per row Therefore, John needs 18 bricks for each row, and since he has 8 rows, he needs a total of 144 bricks (18 x 8).
Response:  We know that John has 11 apples and he wants to share them equally among 3 people. So, if we divide 11 by 3, we get...  11 √∑ 3 = 3 + 1 = 4 Now, each person will get 4 apples. But wait! There is one more condition - John also wants to give each person at least 8 apples. So, let's check if 4 apples are greater than or equal to 8. 4 > 8 (false) Nope, 4 apples are not enough for each person. So, what should John do? He needs to give each person more than 4 apples so that they all get at least 8 apples. How about giving each person 9 apples instead of 4? That way, everyone gets at least 8 apples! 9 > 8 (true) Great! Now, each person will get 9 apples.
"Response:  We know that John wants to buy a house with a total area of  15 square meters and he has two options: Option A) a small house with an area of 10 square meters or Option B) a larger house with an area of 12 square meters. If we let x represent the number of small houses (Option A), then we can write the equation for the total area as follows:  
x(10) + (15 - x)(12) = 15  Now we need to simplify this equation. First, we will multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction:  
10x + 12(15-x) = 10x + 180 - 12x = 190  Next, we will combine like terms:  
20x = 190  Finally, we will divide both sides by 20 to solve for x:  
x = 9.5  So there are 9.5 small houses available."
Response:  To get  16 from 2, we need to multiply 2 by 8. So, the product of 2 and 8 is 16. Therefore, John needs 8 pieces of wood for his house.
Response:  We know that John wants to buy 8 cubic meters of cement for his house construction and he needs 74 bags of cement. So we can start by converting 8 cubic meters to number of bags of cement.  1 cubic meter = 50 bags of cement (this is just an assumption) Therefore, 8 cubic meters = 8 x 50 = 400 bags of cement Now we need to find out how many bags of cement John will have after using 74 bags. 74 bags / 50 bags per cubic meter = 1.48 cubic meters (round up to the nearest whole number) So John will have 1.5 cubic meters of cement left after using 74 bags.
Response:  We know that John wants to buy materials for his house and he has two types of money - TZS 12 and TZS 17. He needs a total of TZS 14 for one package of materials and TZS 25 for another package. So we can write this as:  12 + 17 = 14... (1)  12 + 17 = 25... (2) Now we need to find out how many packages of each type of material John will buy using the equations above. To do this, we can solve equation (1) for x (the number of packages of the first type of material):  12 + 17 = 14 --> 12 + 17x = 14 --> 17x = 14 - 12 --> 17x = 2 --> x = 2/17 So John will buy 2/17 packages of the first type of material. Similarly, we can solve equation (2) for y (the number of packages of the second type of material):  12 + 17 = 25 --> 12 + 17y = 25 --> 17y = 25 - 12 --> 17y = 13 --> y = 13/17 So John will buy 13/17 packages of the second type of material. Therefore, John will buy 2/17 packages of the first type of material and 13/17 packages of the second type of material.
Response:  We know that robin has $3$ coins and each coin is either heads or tails. So, there are $2$ possible outcomes for each coin, i.e., $H$ (heads) and $T$ (tails). Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes = $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$. However, we are told that one of the coins is not heads, so the actual number of possible outcomes is $7$.   Now, let's consider each outcome separately:  1. Heads-Heads-Heads (HHH): This is not possible since all three coins cannot be heads.  2. Heads-Heads-Tails (HHT): This is also not possible since at least one coin must be tails.  3. Heads-Tails-Heads (HTH): This is possible, but we need to check if it satisfies the condition that one coin is not heads. Yes, it does satisfy the condition, so this outcome is valid.  4. Heads-Tails-Tails (HTT): This is also possible, and again, we need to check if it satisfies the condition. No, it doesn't satisfy the condition, so this outcome is invalid.  5. Tails-Heads-Heads (THH): This is not possible since all three coins cannot be heads.  6. Tails-Heads-Tails (THE): This is possible, but we need to check if it satisfies the condition. Yes, it does satisfy the condition, so this outcome is valid.  7. Tails-Tails-Heads (TTT): This is possible, and it satisfies the condition, so this outcome is valid too.   Therefore, the total number of valid outcomes = $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$. The remaining two outcomes ($HHH$ and $HTT$) do not satisfy the given condition.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 cats and each cat eats 23 packets of food. So, in total, Robin needs 43 x 23 = 961 packets of food for all her cats. However, she only has 8 packets left. Therefore, she needs 961 - 8 = 953 more packets of food to feed all her cats.
"Response:  We know that Robin has $41 and wants to divide it equally among 7 friends. So, if we divide $41 by 7, we get:  
$41 √∑ 7 =?  
What is the result of this division?"
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 goats and 13 sheep. If each goat costs $4 and each sheep costs $5, how much money will Robin have in total if she sells all her animals?   To find out how much money Robin will have, we need to calculate the total cost of all her goats and sheep first. Goats: 28 x $4 = $112 Sheep: 13 x $5 = $65 Total cost: $112 + $65 = $177 So, Robin will have $177 if she sells all her animals.
Response:  Firstly, we know that robin has 21 goats and each goat consumes 45 liters of water per day. Secondly, there are 9 cows in total, with each cow requiring 9 liters of water daily. So, to calculate how much water robin needs for his pipes, we need to add up the amount of water required by all his animals. Therefore, the total amount of water needed for pipes is:  21 x 45 = 945 + 9 x 9 = 81 To find out how many pipes Robin will need, let's divide the total amount of water by the capacity of one pipe: 945 + 81 = 1026 / 45 = 23 pipes Robin will need 23 pipes to supply water to all his animals.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin has 28 packets of sweets and each packet contains 14 pieces of candy. So, in total, Robin has  28 x 14 = 392 candies. Now, if Vipin eats 6 packets of sweets, then he will eat  6 x 14 = 84 candies. Therefore, the number of candies left with Robin is  392 - 84 = 308.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how long it takes for the machine to produce 3 units of the product. We know that the machine can produce 6 units per minute, so:   Time taken to produce 3 units = 3/6 = 0.5 minutes (or 30 seconds)   Now, let's calculate how many minutes the machine has worked. Since the machine worked for 30 seconds, we can say that it worked for half a minute:   Machine work time = 0.5 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 30 seconds   Therefore, the machine worked for 30 seconds to produce 3 units of the product.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many minutes are in 5 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 5 = 300 minutes in 5 hours.  2nd step is to calculate how many seconds are in 300 minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 300 x 60 = 18,000 seconds in 5 hours.  3rd step is to calculate how many minutes are in 4 hours. Again, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 4 = 240 minutes in 4 hours.  4th step is to calculate how many seconds are in 240 minutes. Just like before, there are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 240 x 60 = 14,400 seconds in 4 hours. Now we can compare the two amounts of time: 18,000 - 14,400 = 3,600 seconds. So, the machine would have produced 3,600 more seconds of work in 5 hours than it would have in 4 hours.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many minutes are in 9 hours and 44 minutes.  9 x 60 = 540 + 44 = 584 minutes. Now we have to find out how many seconds there are in 584 minutes. 584 x 60 = 34720 seconds. So, the machine can do the work of 34720 seconds or 34720/3 = 11240 jobs in 3 days.
"Response: 
Mashine ya viwandani ilifanya mashati 13 jana na mashati 3 leo. This means that the machine made 13 units in one day and 3 units in another day. So, in total, it produced 16 units of goods (13 + 3).  
Now, we are asked to find out how long it took the machine to produce these 16 units. We know that the machine can make 8 units per hour, so let's divide the number of units produced by the number of units per hour:  
16 units / 8 units/hour = 2 hours  
Therefore, the machine took 2 hours to produce all 16 units of goods."
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many minutes are in 9 hours and 8 minutes.  9 hours = 540 minutes (since there are 60 minutes per hour) + 8 minutes = 548 minutes. Now we need to find out how long it would take to do 2 tasks if each task takes 548 minutes. To do this, we divide 548 by 2 = 274 minutes. Therefore, Machine A can complete 2 tasks in 274 minutes or 4.5 hours.
Response: 1st step is to calculate how many minutes are needed for Shati 3.  1 minute = 60 seconds Therefore, 3 minutes = 3 x 60 = 180 seconds Now we need to add the time taken for Shati 4 and Shati 8. For Shati 4, 1 minute = 60 seconds So, 4 minutes = 4 x 60 = 240 seconds For Shati 8, 1 minute = 60 seconds So, 8 minutes = 8 x 60 = 480 seconds Total time taken = 180 + 240 + 480 = 900 seconds or 15 hours To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 again: 900 x 60 = 54,000 minutes The machine can do 54,000 minutes of work in 15 hours.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 6 units per minute.  
Secondly, we are given that it takes 12 minutes to produce 1 unit of the product. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of units produced in 12 minutes as follows: 
Units produced in 12 minutes = 6 x 12 = 72 
Thirdly, we are told that the machine produces 14 units in one hour. So, we can calculate the time taken to produce 14 units as follows: 
Time taken to produce 14 units = Total number of units / Units produced per minute 
= 72 / 6 
= 12 minutes 
Therefore, the machine will take 12 minutes to produce 14 units."
Response:  We know that mashine did 6 work pieces within 5 minutes and 12 seconds. So we can start by converting the time into minutes:  5 minutes = 5 x 60 = 300 seconds  12 seconds = 12 x 60 = 720 seconds Now let's calculate how many pieces mashine could have done per minute:  6 work pieces / 300 seconds = 2 pieces/minute  6 work pieces / 720 seconds = 8 pieces/minute Therefore, mashine could do 2 or 8 pieces per minute, depending on whether you round up or down to the nearest whole number.
Response:  We know that there are 30 days in April and each day has 24 hours. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of hours in April as follows:   Total hours = Number of days x Number of hours per day   Total hours = 30 x 24   Total hours = 720 To find out how much money is spent per hour, we need to divide the daily expenses by the number of hours spent during the day. So let's do that:   Daily Expenses / Hours Spent Per Day =?   Daily Expenses / Hours Spent Per Day = 165 / 24   Daily Expenses / Hours Spent Per Day = 7 Therefore, the amount spent per hour is Kshs. 7.
Response:  We know that Kurusha has 144 coins and he spends them in 22 days. So we can calculate how much money he spends each day as follows:   Daily expenditure = Total amount of money / Number of days   Daily expenditure = 144 / 22   Daily expenditure = 6 (approximately) Therefore, Kurusha spends approximately Ksh. 6 per day.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money spent per month is $420 (30 x $14).   Now let's find out how much each weekly allocation will be if we divide the monthly amount by four weeks.  Weekly allocation = Total monthly amount / Number of weeks in a month  = $420 / 4 weeks = $105 per week.
Response:  We know that there are 382 days in the first year and 374 days in the second year, so we need to find out how many years it will take for the difference between the two amounts to be equal to $1.   First, let's calculate the total amount of money for each year: Year 1: 382 days x $1 per day = $382 Year 2: 374 days x $1 per day = $374 Now, let's subtract the total amount of money for each year: $382 - $374 = $9 The difference between the two amounts is $9, which is not equal to $1. Therefore, it will take more than one year for the difference between the two amounts to be equal to $1. So, the answer is: It will take more than one year for the difference between the two amounts to be equal to $1.
"Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and we have to divide them into two periods of 20 days each.  
First period (days 1-20): 
We have 20 days x $120 = $2400 per day. Total for first period = $2400 x 20 = $48,000.  Second period (days 21-365): 
We have 345 days x $66 = $22,790 per day. Total for second period = $22,790 x 345 = $7,641,350.  Therefore, the total amount earned from both periods is: $48,000 + $7,641,350 = $7,689,350."
"Response:  We know that there are 325 cows in total and we want to divide them into two groups of  154 cows each for the first week and 114 cows for the second week. To do this, we need to find out how many days there are in each week. There are 7 days in one week, so:  
Week 1 (154 cows) = 154 x 7 = 1098 days  
Week 2 (114 cows) = 114 x 7 = 798 days  Now let's calculate the number of days in 57 weeks:  
57 weeks x 7 days/week = 399 days  
Therefore, if we distribute the 325 cows over 57 weeks, Week 1 will have 1098 days and Week 2 will have 798 days."
Response:  We know that Lucy has 10 cookies and wants to share them equally among four people, so each person will get  10/4 = 2 cookies. However, she also wants to give an extra cookie to each person who gets a cookie, so we need to add one more cookie to each of these amounts. Therefore, the total number of cookies Lucy needs to give out is:  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 cookies.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of sweets that Lucy received. We know that she received 4 biscuits, 22 cookies, and 16 chocolates. To find out how many sweets in total, we can add up all these numbers:  4 + 22 + 16 = 42 Now we want to find out how much each sweet cost. Since Lucy paid Ksh 42 for all the sweets, we can divide this amount by the total number of sweets to get the price per unit:  Ksh 42 / 42 = Ksh 1 per unit So, each biscuit costs Ksh 1, each cookie costs Ksh 1, and each chocolate costs Ksh 1 as well.
Response:  We know that Lucy had 23 cookies and she gave 4 to her friend Keki. So, how many cookies does Lucy have left?  23 - 4 = 19   Therefore, Lucy has 19 cookies left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy has 2 cookies and wants to share them equally among 12 of her friends. So, if she shares them equally, each friend will get  2/12 = 1/6 of a cookie. Now, let's calculate how much money Lucy needs to buy 12 cookies at Ksh. 56 per packet. We know that 1 packet contains 6 cookies, so she needs  12/6 = 2 packets. Therefore, Lucy needs Ksh. 56 x 2 = Ksh. 112 to buy 12 cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 12 people in total and 4 of them have gone to the market. So, the number of people left behind is 12 - 4 = 8. Now, we need to find out how many groups of 36 people can be formed using these remaining 8 people. To do this, we will divide the 8 people into groups of 36.  8 / 36 = 0 remainder 8 (since 8 cannot be divided evenly by 36). Therefore, there is one group of 8 people left behind.
Response:  We know that there are 8 people in total who have not gone to the river (kulikuwa). Of these, 12 have gone to the river and returned (waliingia), leaving 8 - 12 = 6 people still at the river. Now, we need to find out how many of those 6 people have come back (waliingia) and how many are still left at the river. Since 3 people have come back, that means 6 - 3 = 3 people are still left at the river. So, the current number of people at the river is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 13 people in total and 4 of them are already in the base. So, we need to find out how many people are left outside the base.   To do this, we can subtract the number of people inside the base (4) from the total number of people (13):  13 - 4 =?  The result is:  9  Therefore, there are 9 people left outside the base.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 people in total who have not boarded the train yet.  If we subtract the 4 people who have already boarded the train from the total number of people (11), we get:  
8 - 4 =?  
So, there are 4 people left to board the train."
Response:  We know that there are 22 students in the program and 676 people in total. So we can start by finding out how many groups of 22 students there are in 676 people. To do this, we divide 676 by 22:  676 √∑ 22 =?  Can you solve for x?  What is the result?
Response:  We have kulikuwa na wazazi (73), wanafunzi (724) and walimu (744). To find out who has the highest number of people in the program, we need to compare these numbers.  1. Compare wazazi (73) with wanafunzi (724): 73 is less than 724, so wanafunzi has more people in the program.  2. Compare wanafunzi (724) with walimu (744): 724 is less than 744, so walimu has more people in the program. Therefore, based on the information provided, walimu has the highest number of people in the program - 744.
Response:  We know that there are 174 students in the program and 521 students in total. To find out how many more students there are beyond the 174 in the program, we can subtract 174 from 521.  521 - 174 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 347. So, there are 347 additional students who are not in the program.
Response:  We know that there are 61 students in the program and 177 students in total. This means that 177 - 61 = 116 students are not in the program.   Now we need to find out how many of these 116 students have taken loans. The question tells us that 44 students have taken loans. So, if we subtract 44 from 116, we get: 116 - 44 = 72 students who have not taken loans.
"Response:  We know that ikiwa pango lina kina cha futi 919, it means that the total number of students in class 919 is 919.  
Now, we are asked to find out how many students will be transferred from class 919 to class 1307 if the transfer is done equally. To do this, we need to divide 919 by 1307. 
So, we have: 919 √∑ 1307 =? 
The result of this division is 0.725 (rounded to two decimal places). This means that approximately 72.5% of the students in class 919 will be transferred to class 1307."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 1218 is equal to 1000 + 218. Therefore, if we subtract 218 from 1218, we get:  1218 - 218 = 1000 Now, we need to find out how many times 1000 can go into 849. We can do this by dividing 849 by 1000:  849 √∑ 1000 = 0.849 So, there are approximately 0.849 times 1000 in 849. To find out the exact number of times 1000 goes into 849, we can round up the result to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 0.849 up to 1, so there are approximately 1 time 1000 in 849. Therefore, the missing number is 1.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that ikiwa tayari wako (if you are ready) means ""if"" in Swahili. So, if we substitute this word with its English equivalent ""if"", we get:   If (ikiwa tayari wako) tayari wako (ready) = If ready  Now, let's look at the rest of the sentence:  Tayari wako kwenye futi 659 na pango lina kina cha futi 762. This part of the sentence can be translated to English as:  Your readiness is in class 659 and the line is from 762.  Therefore, putting it all together, we get:  If ready, your readiness is in class 659 and the line is from 762.  In other words, the answer to the question ""If ready, where is your readiness?"" is ""Your readiness is in class 659 and the line is from 762."""
Response:  We know that there are 8 fish in total and 6 of them have golden scales. So, we can start by finding out how many fish do not have golden scales.   To find this number, we subtract 6 from 8: 8 - 6 = 2 Therefore, there is 2 fish without golden scales.
Response:  If Paige had 7 goldfish and added 12 more, she would have in total = 7 + 12 = 19 goldfish.   Now, if she sold 4 of them, she would be left with = 19 - 4 = 15 goldfish. So, Paige has 15 goldfish now.
Response:  If there are 16 small fish and 71 big fish in total, then the number of small fish is 16.   Now, if we subtract the number of big fish from the total number of fish, we get: Total fish - Big fish = Small fish 71 + 16 = 87 So, there are 87 fish left after all the big fish have been caught.
Response:  If there are 15 fish in total and 5 have been caught, then we can find out how many fish are left by subtracting 5 from 15.  15 - 5 =?  The answer is 10. So, there are 10 fish left in the water.
Response:  We know that Baada has 2 children and each child has been given  2 sweets. So, in total, Baada has given out 2 x 2 = 4 sweets. Now, we are asked how many sweets Baada has left with her. To find this, we need to subtract the number of sweets given away from the original number of sweets she had. In this case, Baada had 43 sweets and gave away 4 sweets, so:  43 - 4 = 39 sweets. Therefore, Baada has 39 sweets left with her.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mkokoteni had 58 coins in total. Secondly, he lost 35 coins due to various reasons. Therefore, to find out how many coins are left with him, we subtract 35 from 58.  58 - 35 =?   The result is 23. So, Mkokoteni has 23 coins left with him after losing 35 coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mkokoteni had 40 cows and 54 goats before he sold some of them. Secondly, after selling some of his animals, he was left with 39 cows. Now, let's calculate how many goats he had after selling some of his animals. We can do this by subtracting the number of goats he sold from the total number of goats he had initially. We are given that he sold 14 goats. So, if we subtract 14 from 54, we get:  54 - 14 = 40 Goats After selling 14 goats, Mkokoteni had 40 goats. Therefore, the correct answer is: 40 goats.
Response:  We know that there are 11 items in total and each item has a cost of Ksh. 40. So, to find out how much all the items will cost altogether, we can multiply the number of items by their individual cost as follows:  11 x 40 = 440 Therefore, the total cost of all the items is Ksh. 440.
Response:  We know that there are 10 items in total and 8 of them belong to Adam. So, we can start by subtracting 8 from 10:  10 - 8 = 2 That means there are 2 items left that do not belong to Adam. Now, we need to find out how many of those items belong to Eve. Since Eve has half of what is left (i.e., half of 2), she has one item:  2 / 2 = 1 Therefore, Eve has one item, and Adam has eight items.
Response:  We have 8 pieces of wood and we want to make 10 boxes with dimensions of 4 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm each. To determine how many cubic centimeters (cm¬≥) of wood are needed for each box, we need to calculate the volume of each box first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = Length √ó Width √ó Height So, for each box, the length is 4 cm, the width is 2 cm, and the height is 1 cm. Therefore, the volume of each box is: Volume = 4 cm √ó 2 cm √ó 1 cm = 8 cm¬≥ Now that we know the volume of each box, we can calculate how much wood is needed in total. Since we want to make 10 boxes, we just multiply the volume of one box by 10: Total amount of wood needed = Number of boxes √ó Volume of one box Total amount of wood needed = 10 √ó 8 cm¬≥ = 80 cm¬≥ To convert this to meters cube (m¬≥), we divide by 1000 since there are 1000 cubic centimeters in a meter cube: Total amount of wood needed (in m¬≥) = 80 cm¬≥ / 1000 = 0.08 m¬≥
Response:  We know that there are 544 cows in each village and each cow produces 32 liters of milk per day. So we can calculate the total amount of milk produced in one village as follows: Total milk production = Number of cows x Milk production per cow Total milk production = 544 x 32 Total milk production = 17,768 liters Now let's find out how many villages have 10,000 liters of milk. We can divide the total milk production by 10,000 to get the number of villages: Number of villages = Total milk production / 10,000 Number of villages = 17,768 / 10,000 Number of villages = 17768/10000 = 17768/10 = 17768/100 = 17768/1000 = 17768/10000 = 17768/1000000 = 0.17768 or approximately 0.18 villages Therefore, approximately 0.18 villages (or 18%) produce 10,000 liters of milk.
Response:  Firstly, we know that kuna vyungu 466 means there are 466 coins in total. Secondly, we know that kila chungu kina maua 53 na fimbo 181 ndani yake means that 53 coins were taken from the bag and placed in another bag. So, to find out how many coins are left in the original bag, we need to subtract the number of coins taken from the total number of coins. Therefore, the answer is:  466 - 53 = 413.
Response:  First, we know that Kuna has 141 coins in total. Secondly, she has 71 coins of one type (mangapi) and 91 coins of another type (fimbo). Therefore, to find out how many mangapi coins Kuna has, we can subtract the number of fimbo coins from the total number of coins:  141 - 91 = 50. So, Kuna has 50 mangapi coins.
Response: 1) We know that Kila has 40 sufurias and each sufuria contains 400ml of water.  2) To find out how much water Kila has in total, we need to multiply the number of sufurias by the amount of water in each sufuria. So, we can say that Kila has = 40 x 400 = 16,000 ml of water.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 4276 erasers and he gives  4502 skittles to Kuna. So we need to find out how many groups of erasers Steven can give to Kuna using the skittles.  Since there are 154 in each group, we divide 4276 by 154 to get the number of groups:  
Groups = 4276 / 154 = 28    Now we have 28 groups of erasers that Steven can give to Kuna. However, Kuna only wants 4502 skittles, so we need to find out how many extra skittles Steven needs to buy. To do this, we subtract the number of groups from the total number of skittles:  
Extra skittles = 4502 - (28 x 154) = 4502 - 4392 = 110   Therefore, Steven needs to buy 110 extra skittles to complete Kuna's order."
"Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in total and Steven has 4950 Erasers. So we can start by subtracting the number of Erasers Steven has from the total number of Skittles:  3941 - 4950 =?  
Now let's look at each Vikundi (group) of Erasers:  
Vikundi 1 has 495 Erasers, Vikundi 2 has 495 Erasers, and so on until Vikundi 495, which has no Erasers left. Therefore, we can calculate the number of Skittles left after subtracting all the Erasers as follows:  
3941 - (495 x 495) = 3941 - 248,500 =?  
The final result is:  3941 - 248,500 = 365,509 Skittles left."
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and Steven has 517 of them. So, we can start by subtracting the number of Skittles Steven has from the total number of Skittles to find out how many Skittles are left:  896 - 517 =?  379 Skittles are left. Now, we need to divide the remaining Skittles into 8 groups of equal size. Since there are 90 scales in each group, we can use division to find out how many Skittles are in each group:  379 √∑ 90 =?  4 Group A (4 x 90) = 360 Skittles Group B (4 x 90) = 360 Skittles Group C (4 x 90) = 360 Skittles Group D (4 x 90) = 360 Skittles And so on... Therefore, there are 360 Skittles in each group.
Response: 1) The school has 270 students.  2) Each class has an average of 5 students (given). 3) Since there are 5 classes, we can multiply 5 x 5 = 25 students per class. 4) Therefore, the total number of students in each grade is 25 x 5 = 125 students.  So, the total number of grades is 125 / 5 = 25 grades.
Response:  We know that there are 304 students in total and 75 of them have passed. So we can start by finding out how many students did not pass:  304 - 75 = 229 (students who did not pass) Now let's find out how many classes this number of students will be divided into:  229 / 75 = 3 (classes) Therefore, there were three classes with 75 students each who did not pass.
