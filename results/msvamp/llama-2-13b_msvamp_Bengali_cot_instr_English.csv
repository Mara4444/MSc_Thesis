Response:  We know that Julie played with 18 boys on Sunday and Monday together. So, if we subtract the number of boys she played with on Monday (10), from the total number of boys she played with on both days (18), we get:  18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, Julie played with 8 more boys on Sunday than on Monday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with 11 friends on Sunday. So, if she played with 12 friends on Monday, then the difference between the number of friends she played with on Monday and Sunday is:  12 - 11 = 1.  Next, we are asked how many more friends she played with on Monday than on Sunday. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of friends she played with on Sunday from the number of friends she played with on Monday:  12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Julie played with one more friend on Monday than on Sunday.
Response:  Firstly, Julie played with five children on Sunday.  Next, she played with three more children on Monday. So, in total, Julie played with (5 + 3) = 8 children.
Response:  We know that Julie played with 14 children on Monday and 16 children in total. So, to find out how many children she played with on Sunday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the total number of children she played with.  Therefore, the number of children Julie played with on Sunday is:  16 - 14 = 2.  So, Julie played with 2 children on Sunday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with 16 boys in total. Secondly, she played with 12 more boys at night after Somwar. So, if we add 16 and 12, we get:  16 + 12 = 28 Now, let's find out how many boys did Monirul play with on Monday. We are given that Monirul played with 3 times as many boys as Julie played with. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:  Number of boys played with by Monirul = 3 x Number of boys played with by Julie  Substituting the value of Number of boys played with by Julie (which is 28), we get:  Number of boys played with by Monirul = 3 x 28  Simplifying, we get:  Number of boys played with by Monirul = 3 x 28 = 84  Therefore, Monirul played with 84 boys on Monday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with 8 children in total. Secondly, she played with 14 children in total. So, if we subtract 8 from 14, we get:  14 - 8 = 6 Therefore, Julie played with 6 more children than she did with the first group of 8.
Response:  We know that Julie played with 17 children on Sunday, and then she played with 15 children on Monday. So, in total, Julie played with 17 + 15 = 32 children.
Response:  We know that there were 15 boys in total who played tag on Sunday and Monday together.  Moreover, we know that 8 boys played tag with each other on Monday. So, if we subtract 8 from 15, we get the number of boys who played tag on Sunday only.  15 - 8 = 7 Therefore, there were 7 boys who played tag on Sunday only.
Response:  We know that on Sunday, 5 children played with Somwar and 15 children played with Buddha. So, in total, 5 + 15 = 20 children played with both Somwar and Buddha.
Response:  We know that Julie played with 2 kids on Sunday, and then she played with 14 kids on Monday, and finally, she played with 16 kids on Tuesday. So, in total, Julie played with how many kids?   To find out, we need to add up all the numbers of kids she played with each day:  2 + 14 + 16 =?  Can you solve this problem and tell me the correct answer?
Response:  We know that on Sunday (সোমবার), 9 boys played together and won 7 games. On Monday (মঙ্গলবাر), 7 boys played together and won 4 games. And on Wednesday (বুধবার), 96 boys played together and won 8 games. Now we need to find out how many more games were won by the combined team of all three days. To do this, we can subtract the number of games won on each day from the total number of games won by the combined team. Total number of games won by the combined team = Number of games won on Sunday + Number of games won on Monday + Number of games won on Wednesday. Total number of games won by the combined team = 7 + 4 + 8 = 19 games. So, the combined team won 19 games in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of games won by the combined team and the number of games won by the team on any one day is: Difference = Total number of games won by the combined team - Number of games won by the team on any one day. Difference = 19 - 7 = 12 games. In other words, the combined team won 12 more games than the team that played on any one day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with 14 boys on Sunday. Next, she played with 2 boys on Monday and 8 boys on Wednesday. Now, let's calculate how many games she played in total. Total number of games = Number of games played on Sunday + Number of games played on Monday + Number of games played on Wednesday Total number of games = 14 + 2 + 8 = 24 So, Julie played 24 games in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with 8 children on Sunday. Next, we know that she played with 11 children on Monday. Finally, we know that she played with 9 children on Wednesday. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  8 + 11 + 9 = 28 children. Therefore, Julie played with 28 children in total over the three days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with 15 kids on Sunday and Monday together. So, if she played with 15 kids for both days, then in total, she played with 30 kids (15 x 2). Now, let's find out how many kids she played with on each day separately. On Sunday, she played with 15 kids, and on Monday, she played with 18 kids (since there were 18 kids in all). Therefore, the number of kids Julie played with on each day is: Sunday - 15, Monday - 18.
Response:  Firstly, we know that on Sunday, July 13th, 13 boys played cricket together. On Monday, July 14th, 10 boys played cricket together. And on Wednesday, July 16th, 15 boys played cricket together. Now, let's calculate how many boys in total played cricket with each other. Total number of boys who played cricket on Sunday = 13 Total number of boys who played cricket on Monday = 10 Total number of boys who played cricket on Wednesday = 15 Therefore, the total number of boys who played cricket with each other is: 13 + 10 + 15 = 38 So, there were 38 boys in total who played cricket with each other.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played with seven children on Sunday and thirteen children on Monday. So, in total, she played with seventeen children (7 + 13 = 17). Next, we are told that she carded twenty children on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of children Julie played with is seventeen plus twenty, which equals thirty-seven (17 + 20 = 37).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julie played for 12 days with her friends and then she played for another 14 days with different friends. So, in total, she played for 12 + 14 = 26 days. Now, let's calculate how many hours she spent playing in total. We know that each day of play lasted for 8 hours (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, the total number of hours Julie spent playing is:  26 days x 8 hours/day = 208 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that on Sunday, 19 children played together for 3 hours and 8 minutes. So, if we calculate the total time they spent playing together, it would be:  3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes + 8 minutes = 188 minutes. Now, let's move on to Monday. We are given that 18 children played together for 4 hours and 20 minutes. So, the total time they spent playing together would be:  4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes + 20 minutes = 260 minutes. To find out how many more minutes the 19 children played on Sunday compared to the 18 children on Monday, we need to subtract the total time played by the 18 children on Monday from the total time played by the 19 children on Sunday. Therefore, the difference in time would be:  188 minutes - 260 minutes = -72 minutes. So, the 19 children played for 72 fewer minutes than the 18 children on Monday.
Response:  There were 6 people in total who went to the picnic. If 4 of them played tag, then there were 2 others who did not play tag. So, the number of people who did not play tag is 2.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of boys in the class. We know that there are 18 girls in the class and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. So, if there are x boys in the class, then there will be 2x girls in the class. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 2x = 18 (boys) + 2(18) (girls)

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 4x = 36

Combine like terms:

7x = 36

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 5

So, there are 5 boys in the class."
Response:  We know that Julie played with 4 children on Sunday, and she played with 6 children on Monday. So, in total, she played with 10 children (4 + 6) during those two days. Now, we need to find out how many more children she played with on Wednesday compared to the previous two days. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Sunday from the total number of children she played with on Monday and Wednesday. Total number of children played with on Monday and Wednesday = 10 (4 + 6) Children played with on Sunday = 4 Subtracting 4 from 10 gives us: Total number of children played with on Wednesday = 10 - 4 = 6 Therefore, Julie played with 6 more children on Wednesday than she did on the previous two days.
Response: 1) Babu played for 25 minutes. 2) If he had played for 43 minutes, then how many more minutes did he play? To find out, we need to subtract the time he actually played (25 minutes) from the total time he would have played (43 minutes). So, 43 - 25 = 18 minutes. Therefore, if Babu had played for 43 minutes, he would have played for an additional 18 minutes beyond his actual playing time of 25 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, Bob played for 28 minutes and then he played for 42 minutes. So, in total, he played for 70 minutes (28 + 42). Now, if we divide 70 by 63, we get an average of approximately 1.11 minutes per chalk. Therefore, Bob played each chalk for approximately 1.11 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, Bob has 33 chickens and he sells 4 of them. So, after selling 4 chickens, Bob will have 33 - 4 = 29 chickens left. Now, if he sells another 14 chickens, he will have 29 - 14 = 15 chickens left. Therefore, the total number of chickens Bob has sold is 4 + 14 = 18.
Response:  Firstly, Bob has 38 apples and gives 36 to his friend. So, he is left with 38 - 36 = 2 apples. Now, if he eats 16 more apples, he will have 2 + 16 = 18 apples in total. Therefore, Bob can eat 18 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, Bobir had 20 mangoes and gave 34 to his friends. So, he has 20 - 34 = 7 mangoes left with him. Then, he ate 18 more mangoes. Therefore, the total number of mangoes Bobir ate is 7 + 18 = 25 mangoes.
Response: 1st step: Bubir had 21 mangoes and gave 5 to his friend. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 mangoes left.  2nd step: He then ate 9 more mangoes. So, he has 16 - 9 = 7 mangoes left. Therefore, Bubir has 7 mangoes left.
Response: 1st step: He played for 2 hours and then he played for another 5 hours. So, in total, he played for 2 + 5 = 7 hours. Therefore, if he had started playing at 8 am, he would have finished playing at 1 pm (8 + 7 = 1 pm).
Response: 19 - 2 = 17 So, Babir has 17 mangoes left with him.
Response:  We know that Bibir had 32 mishits (misunderstandings) in total. If he had 20 more misunderstandings, then he would have had a total of 52 mis hits (mistakes). So, if Bibir had 20 more misunderstandings, he would have made 20 x 2 = 40 mistakes. Therefore, Bibir made 40 mistakes.
Response: 17 - 15 =?  Yes, that's right! 17 minus 15 is 2. So, if Amir has 36 chocolates and he eats 15 of them, then he has 2 chocolates left.
Response:  If Bob has 30 mangoes and gives away 23 of them, then he has 30 - 23 = 7 mangoes left with him.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 5 balls and Jack has 3 balls. So, in total, they have 5 + 3 = 8 balls. Now, if we subtract the number of balls that Jack has from the total number of balls, we get:  8 - 3 = 5 balls left with Alan.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 2 bags and Jack has 3 bags. So, in total they have 2 + 3 = 5 bags. Now, we are asked to find out how many apples are left with Alan after giving some to Jack. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples given to Jack from the total number of apples Alan had. Since Jack took 3 apples from Alan, so Alan is left with  2 - 3 = 1 bag of apples. Therefore, there are 1 bag of apples left with Alan.
Response:  If Subuja has 2 belons and Jack has 3 belons, then together they have 2 + 3 = 5 belons.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 4 belts in total. If he wears all of them at once, then Alan will have to wear 4 - 1 = 3 belts. So, Alan will have to wear 3 belts.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 10 balls in his bag. He gives 5 balls to Alan. So, Jack has 10 - 5 = 5 balls left. Now, if he gives another ball to Alan, Jack will have 5 - 1 = 4 balls left. Therefore, Jack gives 4 balls to Alan.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 3 bags of apples and Jack has 5 bags of apples. So together they have 3 + 5 = 8 bags of apples. Now, Alan gives 2 bags of apples to park. Therefore, the total number of bags of apples left with Alan is 3 - 2 = 1 bag, and the total number of bags of apples left with Jack is 5 - 0 = 5 bags. Finally, the total number of bags of apples that Alan and Jack have is 1 + 5 = 6 bags.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 2 belts and Jack has 4 belts. So, in total they have 2 + 4 = 6 belts. Now, if we subtract the number of belts Alan has from the total number of belts, we get:  6 - 2 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 belts left after Alan gives back his belts to Jack.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 2 bags of apples and Jack has 6 bags of apples. So, in total they have 2 + 6 = 8 bags of apples. Now, Alan gives 3 bags of apples to Park. Therefore, the number of bags of apples left with Alan is 2 - 3 = 1 bag. And the number of bags of apples left with Jack is 6 - 0 = 6 bags. Finally, we need to find out how many bags of apples Jack gave to Park. We know that Jack gave 3 bags of apples to Park, so the answer is 3.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 5 balls and Jack has 4 balls.  So, together they have 5 + 4 = 9 balls. Now, Alan gives 3 balls to Park. Therefore, Alan has 5 - 3 = 2 balls left, and Jack has 4 balls left. Finally, we can say that Alan has 2 balls in the park and Jack has 4 balls left.
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 6 balls and gave 2 to Jack. So, Alan has 6 - 2 = 4 balls left. Then, Jack took 3 more balls from Alan, so Alan is left with 4 - 3 = 1 ball. Therefore, the total number of balls that Alan had before giving any to Jack was 6, and the total number of balls that Jack had after taking all the balls from Alan was 3 + 2 = 5 balls.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 6 balls and Jack has 3 balls. So, together they have 6 + 3 = 9 balls. Now, if we subtract the number of balls that Jack has (3) from the total number of balls (9), we get: 9 - 3 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 balls left after Jack takes his share.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 5 apples and gives 3 to Jack. So, Alan is left with  5 - 3 = 2 apples. Now, Jack has 6 apples and gives 3 to Park. So, Jack is left with  6 - 3 = 3 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples in Park is 2 + 3 = 5 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has 3 belts and 20 balls in his bag. So, if we subtract the number of balls from the total number of items, we get:   Total Items = 3 + 20 = 23  Now, let's move on to Jack. We know that he has 5 belts and 59 balls in his bag. So, if we subtract the number of balls from the total number of items, we get:   Total Items = 5 + 59 = 64  Therefore, the difference between the total number of items carried by Alan and Jack is:   Difference = 64 - 23 = 41  So, Jack carries 41 more items than Alan.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan and Jack have 7 and 6 balls respectively. So, they have a total of 7 + 6 = 13 balls. Now, let's see how many balls each of them has after playing park. We know that Alan played for 5 minutes and Jack played for 4 minutes. Therefore, Alan has played for 5/60 = 1/12 of an hour, and Jack has played for 4/60 = 1/15 of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of balls they have played as follows: Alan - (1/12) x 60 = 5 balls Jack - (1/15) x 60 = 4 balls So, Alan has played 5 balls and Jack has played 4 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls they have left is 13 - 5 - 4 = 4 balls.
Response:  If Alan has 5 apples and gives Jack 3 apples, then Alan has 5 - 3 = 2 apples left. So, Jack has 3 + 2 = 5 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan has two balls in his park and three balls in total. So, if Jack has six balls in his park, then the number of balls Alan has in his park is two. Now, let's calculate how many more balls Jack has than Alan. We can do this by subtracting the number of balls Alan has in his park from the total number of balls Jack has. In this case, we would subtract two (the number of balls Alan has) from six (the total number of balls Jack has): 6 - 2 = 4. Therefore, Jack has four more balls than Alan.
Response:  To calculate the total time for both activities, we need to know how much time each activity will take.  We are given that the English speaking session will take 6 hours and the Chinese speaking session will take 2 hours.  So, the total time for both activities is:  6 + 2 = 8 hours.
Response:  To calculate the time difference between two times in hours and minutes, we need to subtract the smaller time from the larger time.  First, let's convert both times to hours and minutes.  6 AM is equal to 6 x 60 = 360 minutes.  7 PM is equal to 7 x 60 = 420 minutes.  Now, we can subtract the smaller time (360) from the larger time (420): 420 - 360 = 60 minutes.  So, there are 60 minutes of time difference between 6 AM and 7 PM.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Raian has 3 hours of English and 4 hours of Chinese classes per day. So, if he wants to spend equal time on both subjects daily, he needs to divide his total study time equally between them. Total study time = 3 + 4 = 7 hours Now, let's calculate how much time Raian spends on each subject daily: Time spent on English = Total study time x Percentage of English in total study time Time spent on English = 7 x (3/7) = 21 minutes Time spent on Chinese = Total study time x Percentage of Chinese in total study time Time spent on Chinese = 7 x (4/7) = 35 minutes Therefore, Raian spends 21 minutes on English and 35 minutes on Chinese every day.
Response:  To calculate the total time spent on English speaking practice for both types of learners, we need to know how much time each learner spends on speaking practice daily and how many days they spend on it.  For the beginner learner who speaks for 7 hours daily, the total time spent on speaking practice for 30 days is:  7 hours/day x 30 days = 210 hours  For the advanced learner who speaks for 2 hours daily, the total time spent on speaking practice for 30 days is:  2 hours/day x 30 days = 60 hours  Therefore, the difference in time spent on speaking practice between the two learners is:  210 - 60 = 150 hours  So, the beginner learner spends 150 more hours than the advanced learner on speaking practice over a period of 30 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time is required for Raihan to learn English speaking if he spends 5 hours daily. To do this, we will divide the total number of days (365) by the number of hours spent per day (5): Total Time Required = Total Days x Hours Per Day Total Time Required = 365 x 5 = 1825 hours Now, let's assume that Raihan wants to spend half of his learning time on English speaking and the other half on Bengali speaking. So, he will spend 9 months (half a year) learning each language. Therefore, the total time required for Raihan to learn both languages can be calculated as follows: Total Time Required for Both Languages = Total Time Required for English Speaking + Total Time Required for Bengali Speaking Total Time Required for Both Languages = 1825 + 1825 = 3650 hours Thus, Raihan needs approximately 3650 hours or 147.5 days to learn both English and Bengali speaking at a rate of 5 hours per day.
"Response: 1) If he works for 6 hours every day and there are 7 days in a week, then he works for 42 hours per week (6 x 7 = 42). 2) He takes 5 days off, so he works for 37 hours that week (42 - 5 = 37). 3) To calculate how much time he spends speaking English and Chinese, we need to divide his total work hours by the number of languages he speaks. In this case, he spends 8 hours per day speaking English (6 hours x 1 language = 8 hours), and 4 hours per day speaking Chinese (6 hours x 0.5 languages = 4 hours). So, he spends 240 hours speaking English and 96 hours speaking Chinese each year (8 x 37 = 240; 4 x 37 = 96)."
Response: 1 day = 24 hours So, 2 days = 2 x 24 = 48 hours Now, we need to calculate how many hours of English speaking practice Raihan needs for 6 months. We know that there are 30 days in April, May, and June, so let's assume that Raihan will spend 30 days on each of these months. Therefore, he will spend a total of 90 days on speaking practice during these three months. Since he spends 48 hours per month, he will spend a total of 48 x 90 = 4320 hours on speaking practice during these three months. To find out how many hours Raihan needs for the remaining 3 months (July, August, and September), we can simply multiply the number of hours he spent during the first 3 months by 2: 4320 x 2 = 8640 hours This means that Raihan needs a total of 8640 hours of English speaking practice over the course of 6 months.
Response: 1) If he spends 5 hours daily for English and 4 hours daily for Chinese, then total study time per day = 5 + 4 = 9 hours. 2) Total study time in 6 days = 9 x 6 = 54 hours. 3) Total amount of money spent on English study materials in 6 days = Rs. 50 x 54 = Rs. 2700. 4) Total amount of money spent on Chinese study materials in 6 days = Rs. 40 x 54 = Rs. 2160. 5) Total cost of studying both languages for 6 days = Rs. 2700 + Rs. 2160 = Rs. 4860. So, the total cost of studying both languages for 6 days is Rs. 4860.
Response: 1) If he works for 86 days (2 months and 20 days), then how many hours will he work per day? To find out, we need to divide his total working days by the number of days in each month. There are 30 days in April and 31 days in May, so: Total Working Days = 30 + 31 + 20 = 86 days. Now, let's calculate his daily working hours: Daily Hours = Total Working Days / Number of Days in Each Month. We know that there are 8 hours in a day, so: Daily Hours = 86 days / (30 + 31) = 86 days / 61 days = 1.4 hours/day. Therefore, if he works for 86 days, he will work for approximately 1 hour and 24 minutes per day. As for the remaining questions, we can use similar calculations: 2) If he works for 6 hours per day, then how many days will he work for 86 days? To find this out, we can simply divide the total number of days by the number of hours he works per day: Days = Total Working Days / Hours Per Day. In this case: Days = 86 days / 6 hours/day = 14 days. So, if he works for 6 hours per day, he will work for 14 days. 3) If he works for 4 hours per day, then how many days will he work for 86 days? Again, we can use the same formula: Days = Total Working Days / Hours Per Day. This time: Days = 86 days / 4 hours/day = 21 days. So, if he works for 4 hours per day, he will work for 21 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total time spent on English speaking practice for 6 hours per day, which is equal to:  6 x 30 = 180 minutes/day  Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on Chinese speaking practice for 7 hours per day, which is equal to:  7 x 30 = 210 minutes/day Finally, we need to calculate the total time spent on Spanish speaking practice for 3 hours per day, which is equal to:  3 x 30 = 90 minutes/day Now, let's add up all these times to get the total daily time spent on language learning:  180 + 210 + 90 = 580 minutes/day Therefore, the answer is 580 minutes or 9.5 hours per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rayan spends 6 hours daily learning English and 3 hours daily learning Spanish. So, he spends a total of 9 hours daily on these two languages. Now, let's calculate how much time he spends on each language individually. For English, he spends 6 hours daily, which is equal to 42 hours per week (6 x 7 = 42). For Spanish, he spends 3 hours daily, which is equal to 21 hours per week (3 x 7 = 21). Therefore, Rayan spends 42 hours per week on English and 21 hours per week on Spanish.
Response:  We know that Raihan spends 7 hours daily studying English and he wants to spend 2 hours daily learning Spanish. So, if we subtract 2 from 7, we get 5. Therefore, Raihan will spend 5 hours daily studying English and 4 hours daily learning Spanish.
Response:  We know that Raihan spends 2 hours daily for English speaking practice and he wants to spend 5 hours daily for Chinese speaking practice. So, he will spend 5 - 2 = 3 more hours daily for Chinese speaking practice than English speaking practice. Now, we need to find out how much time Raihan needs to spend in total for all three languages (English, Spanish, and Chinese) per day. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total Time Spent = Time Spent on English + Time Spent on Spanish + Time Spent on Chinese. Since Raihan already spends 2 hours daily for English speaking practice, he will spend 3 more hours daily for Chinese speaking practice, and he will spend 4 hours daily for Spanish speaking practice, we can write down the equation as follows: Total Time Spent = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 hours/day. Therefore, Raihan needs to spend 9 hours daily for all three languages (English, Spanish, and Chinese).
Response: 1) If he spends 3 hours daily for English and Chinese studies, then he will spend 2 hours daily for other subjects (as he has mentioned that he spends 3 hours daily for English and Chinese). So, he will spend 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week for other subjects. 2) Now, let's calculate how many weeks he needs to study each subject to complete the course in 6 months. For English, he needs to study for 6 months x 4 weeks/month = 24 weeks. For Chinese, he needs to study for 6 months x 4 weeks/month = 24 weeks as well. Therefore, the total number of weeks he needs to study all subjects is 24 + 24 = 48 weeks. 3) Finally, we can calculate how much time he needs to spend each day to complete the course within 6 months. To do this, we need to divide the total number of weeks by the number of days in a week (i.e., 7 days). So, 48 weeks / 7 days/week = 6.86 days/week (approximately 7 days). Therefore, he needs to spend approximately 7 days/week studying all subjects to complete the course within 6 months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Raihan spends 7 days learning English and Chinese every month. So, in one month, he spends 7 x 2 = 14 hours learning English and Chinese. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends daily on these two subjects. Daily time spent on English = Total time spent on English / Number of days spent on English per month Daily time spent on Chinese = Total time spent on Chinese / Number of days spent on Chinese per month Using the values we have obtained above, we can now calculate the daily time spent on each subject as follows: Daily time spent on English = 14 hours / 30 days = 2 hours/day Daily time spent on Chinese = 14 hours / 30 days = 2 hours/day Therefore, Raihan spends 2 hours daily on both English and Chinese.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tuesday he bought 8 cans of rice.  Secondly, we know that on other days (Wednesday to Sunday), he bought 7 cans of rice each day. So, in total, he bought 8 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 30 cans of rice during the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tapan has 7 bags of rice on Sunday.  On Monday, he buys 12 bags more. So, his total number of bags becomes:  7 + 12 = 19 bags.  Now, let's find out how many bags are left with him after giving away some to others for free. We know that he gives away half of the total number of bags (i.e., 19) to others. So, the number of bags left with him is:  19 / 2 = 9 bags.  Therefore, Tapan has 9 bags of rice left with him after giving away some to others for free.
Response: 1) He bought four cans of rice on Sunday. 2) On other days, he bought more than four cans of rice. 3) In total, he bought six cans of rice. So, the number of cans of rice he bought on other days is:  6 - 4 = 2  Therefore, he bought two more cans of rice on other days.
Response: 1) On Sunday, Tapan bought 3 cans of rice. 2) He already had 4 cans in his stock. So, he has a total of 3 + 4 = 7 cans of rice now. 3) Yesterday (Monday), he bought 8 more cans of rice. Therefore, he has a total of 7 + 8 = 15 cans of rice now.
Response:  We know that Tuesday, he bought 10 cans of rice. On Wednesday, he bought 3 cans of vegetables and on Thursday, he bought 7 cans of fruits. So, in total, he bought:  10 + 3 + 7 = 20 cans.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Somwar (Sunday) he bought 8 cans of rice.  Next day, Monday, he bought 10 cans of rice.  Then, on Tuesday, he bought 4 cans of rice. So, in total, he bought  8 + 10 + 4 = 22 cans of rice.
Response:  We know that Tapan has consumed 3 cans of tea on Sunday and 4 more cans on Monday, for a total of 7 cans.  Moreover, he has drunk 44 bottles of water in total. So, to find out how many cans of tea Tapan has consumed in total, we need to divide the number of bottles of water he has drunk by the number of cans he drank each day:  7 cans / 3 cans per day = 2 days  Therefore, Tapan has consumed 2 x 3 = 6 cans of tea in total.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red balls and 16 blue balls in the basket. To find out how many more red balls than blue balls, we can subtract the number of blue balls from the total number of red balls.   Red balls = 17 Blue balls = 16 Total balls = 17 + 16 = 33 Now, let's subtract the number of blue balls from the total number of balls to get the difference:  33 - 16 = 17 So, there are 17 more red balls than blue balls in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. Total number of apples = 5 + 11 = 16 So, there are 16 apples in all. Now, let's compare the number of red apples with the number of green apples: Number of red apples = 5 Number of green apples = 11 Subtracting the two numbers gives us: 11 - 5 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the basket. We can represent this information as follows:  Red Apples (10) + Green Apples (x) = Total Apples (15)  where x is the number of green apples. Now, if we add 15 to both sides of the equation, we get:  10 + x + 15 = 30  Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we have:  10 + x + 15 = 30  20 + x = 30  Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:  10 + x = 20  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, there are 10 green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are three types of mangoes in the basket - lal am, sabuj am, and some more sabuj am. So, we can start by listing out these three types of mangoes:   Lal Am (3) Sabuj Am (10) Some More Sabuj Am (?) Now, we need to find out how many more sabuj am are there in the basket. To do this, we can subtract the number of lal am and sabuj am from the total number of mangoes in the basket. Total Mangoes = Lal Am + Sabuj Am + Some More Sabuj Am Total Mangoes = 3 + 10 + x x = 13 So, there are 13 mangoes in the basket. Therefore, the answer is: There are 13 mangoes in the basket, including 3 lal am, 10 sabuj am, and some more sabuj am.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red balls, 15 blue balls, and 8 green balls in the basket. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:  7 + 15 + 8 = 30 balls in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 8 green balls in the basket. To find out how many more green balls there are than blue balls, we need to subtract the number of blue balls from the total number of balls. So, if we subtract 11 (the number of blue balls) from 26 (the total number of balls), we get:  26 - 11 = 15 Therefore, there are 15 more green balls than blue balls in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 2 red apples, 6 green apples, and 14 blue apples in the basket. To find out how many more blue apples there are than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. So, if we subtract 2 (the number of red apples) from 20 (the total number of apples), we get: 20 - 2 = 18. Therefore, there are 18 more blue apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red balls and 11 blue balls in the basket. To find out how many more red balls than blue balls, we can subtract the number of blue balls from the total number of red balls:  19 - 11 = 8 So, there are 8 more red balls than blue balls.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red balls and 90 blue balls in the basket. So, if we add 6 + 90 = 96 balls in total. Now, let's find out how many red and blue balls are there in the basket. Red balls: 6 Blue balls: 90 Therefore, there are 6 red balls and 90 blue balls in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red balls and 14 blue balls in the basket. So, if we subtract the number of blue balls from the total number of balls, we can find out how many red balls there are: Total number of balls = 18 + 14 = 32 Red balls = Total number of balls - Blue balls = 32 - 14 = 18 Therefore, there are 18 red balls in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples, 14 yellow apples, and 6 green apples in the basket. To find out how many yellow and green apples there are in total, we can add 14 + 6 = 20. So, there are 20 yellow and green apples in the basket.
Response:  There are 65 tokens in total. Each token has either 7 red pechis or 3 blue pechis. So, we can represent this information as follows: Total number of pechis = 7 x 40 + 3 x 25 = 280 + 75 = 355 pechis. Therefore, there are 355 pechis in total.
Response:  There are 11 tokars (boxes) in total. Each tokar contains either 10 red balls or 12 blue balls. So, we need to find out how many red balls and blue balls there are in total. We know that each tokar has either 10 red balls or 12 blue balls, so let's represent this information as an equation:  10R + 12B = 11  where R is the number of red balls and B is the number of blue balls. Now we can solve for R and B using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. First, we can isolate R by subtracting 12B from both sides of the equation:  10R - 12B = 11 - 12B  Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to get rid of the fraction:   R - B = 11/10 - B  Finally, we can add B to both sides of the equation to find R:  R = 11/10 + B  To find the total number of red balls, we just multiply R by 10:  Total Red Balls = 11/10 + B x 10  To find the total number of blue balls, we simply subtract the total number of red balls from 11:  Total Blue Balls = 11 - (11/10 + B) x 10  Now we have two equations with two unknowns (R and B). Can you solve them simultaneously to find the total number of red balls and blue balls?
"Response:  We know that there are 6 tokras (baskets) in total. Each basket contains either 16 red balls or 18 blue balls. So, we need to find out how many baskets contain red balls and how many contain blue balls. Let's use ""R"" for red balls and ""B"" for blue balls. We can write an equation based on the information given: R + B = 6...(1) Since each basket contains either 16 or 18 balls, we can write two more equations: R x 16 = 16R...(2) B x 18 = 18B...(3) Now we have three equations and three variables (R, B, and 6). Can you solve them to find out how many baskets contain red balls and how many contain blue balls?"
Response:  There are seven tokens in total. Each token has either one red dot or two blue dots. So, we can represent this information as follows:  1 red dot + 2 blue dots = 3 dots per token. Since there are seven tokens, we have:  7 x 3 = 21 dots in total. Therefore, there are 21 dots in total, with 14 red dots and 7 blue dots.
Response:  We know that there are 4 red apples and 3 green apples in total. So, if we add 4 + 3 = 7 apples in all. Therefore, there are 7 apples in total.
Response:  We know that each tokra has 4 red pips and some other colors as well. So, if we divide the total number of pips in both tokras equally among them, we can find out how many green pips are there in one tokra. Total number of pips = (4 x 2) + some other colors = 8 + X (where X is the number of other colors) Since there are 12 pips in total, we can set up an equation: 8 + X = 12 Solving for X, we get: X = 4 Therefore, there are 4 green pips in one tokra.
Response: 16 - 13 = 3 So there are 3 more blue eggs than others in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 red pens and 4 blue pens in total. Now, if there were 15 such sets of pens, we need to find out how many pens would be there in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of red pens (19) by the number of sets (15). So, the total number of pens would be:  19 x 15 = 285 pens.
Response:  We know that there are 10 pigeons in total and 4 of them are blue. So, we can write: 4 + x = 10 where x is the number of white pigeons. Now, we also know that there are 6 white pigeons. Therefore, we can substitute x with 6 and solve for the equation: 4 + 6 = 10 Yes, it's true! There are 10 pigeons in total, and 4 of them are blue, while 6 are white.
Response:  We know that there are 60 holes in total and 2 lal am (red eggs) among them. So, we can start by counting how many sabuj am (green eggs) there are based on the number of holes. There are 60 holes, so we can assume that each hole contains one sabuj am. Therefore, there are 60 sabuj am in total. Now, let's count how many laal am (red eggs) there are based on the remaining holes. Since there are 2 laal am, and each hole can contain either a sabuj am or a laal am, we can divide the remaining holes by 2 to find out how many laal am there are. There are 60 - 2 = 58 holes left, so there are 58 / 2 = 29 laal am. Therefore, there are 60 sabuj am and 29 laal am in total.

Response:  Firstly, there were three actions (3) and four reactions (4). Now, two more reactions have been added to each action, making it 2 x 3 = 6 additional reactions. So, in total, there are now 3 + 6 = 9 actions and reactions.
Response:  Firstly, there were seven actions (shelves) in total. Then, three more action figures (Avengers) were added to each shelf, making it two times as many action figures as before. So, if there were initially seven action figures, then after adding three more to each shelf, there would be:  7 x 2 = 14 action figures in total.
Response:  We know that there are already two cats in the house, and we want to add more cats. So, if we add six more cats, how many cats will be in the house altogether?   Solution:  If we have two cats now and add six more, then we will have a total of (2 + 6) = 8 cats in the house.
Response:  Firstly, there were 4 pigeons in total. Each of them had 2 friends, so there were 4 x 2 = 8 pigeons altogether. Now, if we add the original 4 pigeons to the new ones, we get 8 + 4 = 12 pigeons. So, initially, there were 4 pigeons and then 8 more pigeons joined, making a total of 12 pigeons.
Response:  We know that there are four fences and six cows in total. If we add four more cows to each of the existing three fences, then we will have: 3 x 4 = 12 additional cows. So, in total, there will be: 6 + 12 = 18 cows.
Response:  We know that there are three pens and two bags in the fence. So, if we add five more pens to the fence, we will have a total of (3 + 5) = 8 pens. Now, let's count the number of bags. There are already two bags in the fence, so adding five more pens will not change the number of bags. Therefore, the final number of bags will still be two. In summary, if we add five more pens to the fence, we will have eight pens and two bags.
"Response:  We know that there are three fences and four bags of cement in the cart. If two more bags of cement are added to each fence, how many bags of cement will be left over after all the fences have been built?  To find out, we need to calculate how many bags of cement each fence needs. There are three fences, so let's call the number of bags needed for each fence ""x"".  Since each fence requires two additional bags of cement, we can write an equation:  3x + 2 = 4 (since there are four bags of cement total)  Now solve for x:  3x + 2 = 4  3x = 2   x = 2/3  So each fence needs 2/3 of a bag of cement.  Now let's calculate how many bags of cement will be left over after all the fences have been built:  3(2/3) = 6/3 = 2  Therefore, two bags of cement will be left over after all the fences have been built."
Response:  We know that there are two pairs of birds and six bags of rice in the house. So, if we assume that each bird eats one bag of rice per day, then there will be three bags of rice left over after all the birds have eaten their fill. Therefore, the number of birds that can fit in the house is three.
Response:  We know that there are four pens and six bags in the fence. Two bags have been joined together. So, we need to find out how many bags are left outside.  Since two bags have been joined together, there are only four bags left outside. Therefore, the number of bags outside is four.
Response:  We know that there are 3 pens and 4 pencils in the fence. So, if we add the number of pens and pencils together, we get:  3 + 4 = 7  Therefore, there are 7 writing instruments (pens and pencils) in the fence.
Response:  We know that there are six people in the house and three guests visiting. So, if we add the number of people inside the house to the number of guests, we get:  6 (people in the house) + 3 (guests) = 9  Therefore, there are nine people in total who live or are visiting the house.
Response:  We know that there are four paakhi (birds) and three bhagdharas (crows) in the fence. So, if we add six more crows to the fence, how many birds will be left inside?  To solve this problem, let's use a number line to represent the total number of birds and crows initially present in the fence.  Here is the number line:  4 (paakhi) + 3 (bhagdharas) = 7  Now, when we add six more crows, the total number of birds and crows becomes:  7 (initial) + 6 (additional) = 13  So, after adding six more crows, there will be seven birds left inside the fence.
Response:  We know that there are six fences and four cows inside each fence. So, if we multiply six (the number of fences) by four (the number of cows in each fence), we get:  6 x 4 = 24 cows inside all the fences.
Response:  There are five more people who will join the two friends (F) in the fence (F). So, there will be F + 5 = 7 people in total inside the fence. Now, each of the four bags (B) has three apples (A), so there will be 4 x 3 = 12 apples in total outside the fence. Therefore, the number of apples that the seven people (P) inside the fence can have is 7 x A = 7 x 3 = 21 apples.
Response:  We know that there are three fences and two cows in the field. So, if we subtract the number of cows from the total number of animals in the field, we get: Total number of animals in the field = 3 (fences) + 2 (cows) = 5 Now, we need to find out how many bags of hay are needed for the cows. Since each cow eats one bag of hay per day, we can calculate the total number of bags of hay required as follows: Total number of bags of hay required = Number of cows x Number of days they will eat hay = 2 x 6 = 12 bags of hay Therefore, there are 12 bags of hay required for the two cows.
Response:  We know that there are five bags of rice and three bags of fence.  So, if we add three bags of fence to each bag of rice, we get:  5 x 3 = 15 bags of rice and fence.
Response:  We know that there are six hens and two ducks in the farm. If we add three more ducks to the farm, then there will be two + three = five ducks in total. Now, let's count how many chickens and ducks are in the farm together. There are six hens and five ducks, so the total number of birds is: 6 + 5 = 11.
Response:  We know that there are six fences and each fence has four bags of cement. So, in total, there will be 6 x 4 = 24 bags of cement.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first paragraph has 48 words. Secondly, we know that the second paragraph has 11 words more than the first paragraph. So, if we subtract 48 from 69 (the total number of words in the two paragraphs), we get:  69 - 48 = 21  Therefore, there are 21 more words in the second paragraph than in the first one.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first story is 37 pages long. Secondly, we know that the second story is 80 pages long. Now, let's find out how many more pages are there in the second story compared to the first one. To do this, subtract the number of pages in the first story from the number of pages in the second story:  80 - 37 = 43 So, the second story has 43 more pages than the first story.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first paragraph has 60 words. So, if the total number of words in the book is 93, then the second paragraph will have: 93 - 60 = 33 words. Therefore, the second paragraph contains 33 words.
Response:  We know that the total number of pages in the book is 67. The second chapter has 36 pages. So, we can find out how many pages are left for the first chapter by subtracting 36 from 67:  67 - 36 = 31 Now, we need to divide the remaining pages (31) by 2 to find out how many pages the first chapter has:  31 / 2 = 15 Therefore, the first chapter has 15 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first adhyay has 66 pages. Secondly, we know that the second adhyay has 35 pages. And thirdly, we know that the third adhyay has 24 pages. To find out the total number of pages of the book, we need to add up all these page numbers. So, the total number of pages of the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book contains 125 pages in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first story is 91 pages long. Secondly, we know that the second story is 23 pages longer than the first one. So, if we subtract 23 from 91, we get 68. Therefore, the second story has 68 pages. Finally, we know that the third story is 25 pages shorter than the second story. So, if we subtract 25 from 68, we get 43. Hence, the third story has 43 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first story has 35 pages and the second story has 18 pages more than the first one. So, the second story will have 35 + 18 = 53 pages. Now, we are asked to find out how many pages the third story will have if it is 3 pages less than the second story. To do this, we need to subtract 3 from 53, which gives us 49 pages. Therefore, the third story will have 49 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first story has 53 pages. Secondly, we know that the second story has 75 pages. Thirdly, we know that the third story has 21 pages. Now, let's calculate the total number of pages of all three stories combined. We can do this by adding up the page counts of each story:  53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages of all three stories is 149 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 adhyay (chapters) in the book. Secondly, each chapter has 61 shlokas (verses). Therefore, to find out how many verses are there in the entire book, we need to multiply the number of chapters with the number of shlokas in each chapter. So, the total number of verses in the book is:  31 x 61 = 1931 verses.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two adjectives in the sentence. So, we can start by identifying them. The first adjective is ""two"" and the second adjective is ""thirty"". Now, let's count how many words each of these adjectives modifies. The word ""two"" modifies the noun ""books"", and the word ""thirty"" modifies the noun ""pages"". Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many pages have two books?"" is 30 (since each book has thirty pages)."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two adjectives in the sentence.  The first adjective is ""অভিনয়"" and the second adjective is ""অধ্যায়"". So, we can start by identifying the number of words in each adjective.  1. অভিনয় - This word has three syllables (অ-ভি-নয়). Therefore, it contains three words.  2. অধ্যায় - This word has four syllables (অ-ধ্-ভ্-আয়). Therefore, it contains four words. Now, let's add up the total number of words in both adjectives: 3 + 4 = 7 words. So, the total number of words in the given sentence is 7."
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 62 campers went rafting. In the evening, 39 campers went rafting. So, the total number of campers who went rafting in both sessions is:  62 + 39 = 101 Now, we need to find out how many more campers went rafting in the evening than in the morning. To do this, we subtract the number of campers who went rafting in the morning from the total number of campers who went rafting in both sessions:  101 - 62 = 39 Therefore, there were 39 more campers who went rafting in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning (সকাল), 54 campers went for a ride. In the evening (বিকাল), 61 campers went for a ride. Now, we need to find out how many more campers went for a ride in the evening compared to the morning. To do this, we can subtract the number of campers who went for a ride in the morning from the number of campers who went for a ride in the evening. So, let's subtract:  54 - 61 =?  The difference between the two numbers is:  61 - 54 = 7. Therefore, 7 more campers went for a ride in the evening compared to the morning.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 15 campers roamed around. In the afternoon, they did some more activities and roamed around for another 32 jn (jn stands for ""janas"" or ""hours""). So, in total, they roamed around for 47 jn (15 + 32). Now, we need to find out how many campers were there in the afternoon. To do this, we can divide the total number of campers who roamed around in the afternoon (47) by the number of hours they spent roaming around (32). This gives us: 47 / 32 = 1.44 Therefore, there were approximately 1.44 times as many campers in the afternoon as there were in the morning. Since there were 15 campers in the morning, we can multiply 1.44 by 15 to get the approximate number of campers in the afternoon: 1.44 x 15 = 21.6 So, there were approximately 21.6 campers in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that there were 7 campers who went to the campsite and they spent 60 days there. So, if we divide 60 by 7, we get an average of 8 days per camper. Therefore, each camper stayed for 8 days at the campsite.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 36 people worked and each person worked for 1 hour. So, the total number of hours worked in the morning is:  36 x 1 = 36 hours In the afternoon, 13 people worked and each person worked for 2 hours. So, the total number of hours worked in the afternoon is:  13 x 2 = 26 hours Finally, in the evening, 49 people worked and each person worked for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours worked in the evening is:  49 x 3 = 147 hours Total number of hours worked in all three shifts = 36 + 26 + 147 = 209 hours Therefore, the total number of campers who worked is:  209 / 1 hour = 209 campers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 44 campers went to the beach and in the evening, 39 campers returned from the beach. So, the number of campers who did not return from the beach is:  44 - 39 = 5.  Now, let's calculate how many more campers returned from the beach than those who did not return. We can do this by subtracting the number of campers who did not return from the total number of campers who went to the beach:  5 (campers who did not return) + 39 (campers who returned) = 44 (total campers who went to the beach). Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who returned and those who did not return is:  44 - 5 = 39.  Finally, we need to find out how many more campers returned from the beach than those who did not return as a percentage of the total number of campers who went to the beach. To do this, we divide the difference by the total number of campers who went to the beach and multiply by 100:  (39 - 5) / 44 x 100% = 86.4%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning (সকাল), 53 people roamed around and in the evening (বিকাল), 48 people roamed around. So, the total number of people who roamed around during the day is:  53 + 48 = 101  Now, let's find out how many more people roamed around in the evening compared to the morning. To do this, subtract the number of people who roamed around in the morning from the total number of people who roamed around during the day:  101 - 53 = 48  Therefore, 48 more people roamed around in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 33 campers went to the river and came back with 34 campers. So, there were 33 + 34 = 67 campers in total who went to the river. Now, if 10 campers stayed behind, then there would be 67 - 10 = 57 campers left. Therefore, the number of campers who went to the river in the afternoon is 57.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 13 campers went hiking and 59 campers stayed back at the campsite. This means that 72 campers (13 + 59) were present in total.  Now, in the evening, 21 campers went hiking, leaving 51 campers behind at the campsite. So, the total number of campers who went hiking throughout the day is:  21 + 13 = 34 campers. Therefore, the total number of campers who did not go hiking is:  51 - 34 = 17 campers. The final answer is: There were 72 campers in total, out of which 34 went hiking, and 17 did not go hiking.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 29 campers went for hiking and 66 campers stayed back at the campsite. This means that 29 + 66 = 95 campers were present in total. Now, if 26 campers went for hiking in the evening, then the total number of campers who went hiking throughout the day is 29 + 26 = 55. So, the number of campers who did not go hiking in the evening is 95 - 55 = 40. Therefore, there were 40 campers who did not go hiking in the evening.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 41 campers went rafting in the morning and 4 campers went hiking. So, the total number of campers who went rafting or hiking is:  41 + 4 = 45 campers. Now, we are told that 26 campers went swimming in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of campers who engaged in any activity (rafting, hiking, or swimming) is:  45 + 26 = 71 campers. Finally, we want to find out how many campers did not engage in any activity. We can do this by subtracting the total number of campers who engaged in an activity from the total number of campers:  71 - 45 = 26 campers did not engage in any activity.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 46 campers went on a trip and 43 of them returned in the morning. So, the number of campers who did not return in the morning is 46 - 43 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these 3 campers returned in the evening. We can do this by subtracting the number of campers who returned in the evening from the total number of campers who did not return in the morning. Therefore, the number of campers who returned in the evening is:  3 - (3) = 0. So, there were no campers who returned in the evening.
Response:  If Rechel can throw 4 apples from a basket, and there were initially 7 apples in the basket, then how many apples are left in the basket now?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of apples thrown (4) from the initial number of apples (7):  7 - 4 =?  The answer is: 3. So, there are 3 apples left in the basket now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially four apples in the basket. Then, three apples were taken out by Recheler. So, now there are two apples left in the basket. Therefore, the correct answer is:  3 (the number of apples taken out by Recheler)
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rechel has 7 apples and she gives 3 to her friend. So, now Rechel has 7 - 3 = 4 apples left with her. Now, if we consider the remaining 5 apples as one group, then there are 5 groups of apples in total (1 group of 5 apples each). Therefore, the number of apples that Rechel has after giving 3 to her friend is 4 x 5 = 20 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rechel has two bags of apples and each bag contains six apples. So, in total, Rechel has 2 x 6 = 12 apples. Now, if she gives three apples to her friend, she will be left with 12 - 3 = 9 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Rechel had before giving any to her friend is 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rechel has 6 apples in total and she gave 2 apples to her friend. So, the number of apples left with Rechel is:  6 - 2 = 4 Now, we are told that out of these 4 apples, 1 apple was eaten by Rechel and 3 apples were given away as gifts. Therefore, the final number of apples left with Rechel is:  4 - 1 = 3
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rechel has 3 bags of apples and each bag contains 27 apples. So, in total, she has  3 x 27 = 81 apples. Now, if we subtract the number of apples she has already eaten (2), we get: 81 - 2 = 79 apples left with her.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rechel took 7 apples from the tree and then she put back 2 new apples. So, if we subtract 2 from 7, we get:  7 - 2 = 5 Now, there are 5 apples left in the basket. But wait! We also know that there were initially 6 apples in the basket before Rechel took any. So, let's add 6 to our previous answer:  5 + 6 = 11 Finally, we have our answer: There were originally 11 apples in the basket before Rechel took any.
Response:  Firstly, there were two apples in the basket. Then, four new apples were added to the basket, making a total of six apples. Now, three more apples are added to the basket, bringing the total number of apples to nine. So, there are nine apples in the basket now.
Response:  Firstly, there are 52 cards in a deck of playing cards.  Of those, two are jokers (J). So, we can subtract 2 from 52 to get the number of non-joker cards:  52 - 2 = 50 Now, let's look at each suit. There is one ace (A) in each suit, so we have 4 aces in total (one for each suit): Hearts (H), Diamonds (D), Clubs (C), and Spades (S). Therefore, we can add 4 to our previous count:  50 + 4 = 54 Finally, since there are seven cards in each suit (Ace through Seven), we can multiply 7 by 4 suits to get the total number of cards in each rank:  7 x 4 = 28 So, the total number of cards in each rank is 28.  However, we still need to account for the Jokers. Since there are two Jokers, we can add them to our total:  54 + 2 = 56 And that's the final answer! The total number of cards in a standard deck of playing cards is 56.
"Response:  We know that there are three apples in Recheler's basket. Each apple weighs 800 grams. So, the total weight of the three apples is 3 x 800 = 2400 grams. Now, if we divide this weight by the number of apples, we get the average weight per apple. In this case, it would be: 2400 / 3 = 800 grams per apple. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How much does each apple weigh?"" is 800 grams."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four apples in Recheler's basket. Secondly, each apple can be shared equally among seven people, so we can say that one apple can be divided into seven equal parts. Now, let's calculate how many apples Recheler has in total. We know that he has four apples in his basket and he can share each apple with seven people, so we can multiply four by seven to get the total number of apples Recheler has: Total number of apples = 4 x 7 = 28 apples So, Recheler has 28 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 2 marbles in Ed's bag initially.  Then, he lost some marbles (we don't know how many). Now, there are 19 marbles left in his bag. So, if we subtract the number of marbles Ed had initially (2) from the total number of marbles left in his bag (19), we can find out how many marbles Ed lost:  19 - 2 = 17  Therefore, Ed lost 17 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 marbles in Doga's bag. Secondly, Doga has lost 11 marbles while playing with his friends. So, if we subtract 11 from 10, we get: 10 - 11 = -1 Now, we have -1 marble left in Doga's bag. However, this is not possible as we cannot have negative marbles! Therefore, the correct answer is 0 marbles left in Doga's bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Doggo had 6 marbles in total and lost 7 of them to play with Dugge. So, he has 6 - 7 = 9 marbles left. Now, if Eddie has 22 marbles in total, then Doggo has 9 + 22 = 31 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edith has 5 marbles and she lost 3 of them in the game. So, she has 5 - 3 = 2 marbles left with her. Now, if we divide 27 (the total number of marbles) by 5 (the number of marbles Edith had), we get an approximate value of 5.4. Therefore, approximately 5 marbles were left with Edith after the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 24 marbles in total. Secondly, he lost 9 marbles while playing with his dog. So, how many marbles does Ed have left now? To find out, we need to subtract 9 from 24. Here's the calculation:  24 - 9 =?  The result is: 15 Now, we know that Ed has 15 marbles left after playing with his dog.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edith had 29 marbles in total. Secondly, she lost 17 marbles while playing with her dog. So, how many marbles does Edith have left now? To find out, we need to subtract 17 from 29. Here's the calculation:  29 - 17 =?  The result is: 12 Now, we know that Edith has 12 marbles left after losing 17 while playing with her dog.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 19 marbles in total. Secondly, he lost some marbles while playing with his dog. Finally, he has 8 marbles left. So, if we subtract the number of marbles he lost from his initial total, we can find out how many marbles he lost. 19 - 8 = 11 Marbles Lost. Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles while playing with his dog.
Response:  We know that there were 30 marbles in the bag and 21 of them fell out when the dog bit into it. So, there are 30 - 21 = 9 marbles left in the bag. Now, we need to find out how many marbles the dog had before it bit into the bag. Since 91 - 30 = 61 marbles were left after the dog took all the marbles out of the bag. Therefore, the dog had 61 - 21 = 40 marbles before it bit into the bag.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has 12 marbles in total. Secondly, he lost 20 marbles while playing with his friend. So, how many marbles does Ed have left now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of marbles he lost from his initial amount. Therefore, 12 - 20 =?  Now, let's calculate. 12 - 20 =... (Subtracting 20 from 12) 12 - 20 = 0! Yes, you heard it right; Ed has no more marbles left after losing all of them while playing with his friend."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who will be given meals if all 408 students are provided with mid-day meals. To do this, we multiply the number of students by the number of days in a week (7). So, Total Number of Students x Number of Days in a Week = Total Number of Meals. In our case, Total Number of Students = 408 and Number of Days in a Week = 7, so Total Number of Meals = 408 x 7 = 2856 meals per week. Now, let's calculate the cost of providing these meals. We know that each meal costs Tk. 10, so the total cost of providing 2856 meals per week is 2856 x Tk. 10 = Tk. 28,560 per week. Next, we need to calculate the cost of providing meals for only 42 students who will not receive mid-day meals. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of meals required for these 42 students is 42 x 7 = 294 meals per week. The cost of providing these meals at Tk. 10 per meal is 294 x Tk. 10 = Tk. 2940 per week. Therefore, the total cost of providing mid-day meals for all 408 students and meals for 42 students who will not receive mid-day meals is Tk. 28,560 + Tk. 2940 = Tk. 31,500 per week.
"Response:  Firstly, if 479 students are participating in the meal program and each student is given $3 worth of food, then the total amount spent on food would be:  479 x $3 = $1437  Now, if 489 students are joining the menu program and each student is given $2 worth of food, then the total amount spent on food would be:  489 x $2 = $978  So, the difference between the two amounts is: $1437 - $978 = $459  Therefore, the answer to the question ""How much more money will be spent on food for the additional 10 students?"" is $459."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 310 students in total and out of them, 185 students have received their mid-term examination results. So, the number of students who have not received their mid-term examination results is:  310 - 185 = 125. Now, we need to find out how many students have scored above 75% marks in their mid-term examinations. According to the information provided, 125 students have scored above 75% marks. Therefore, the answer is:  125.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who will get food if each student gets 288 grams of rice and there are 264 students in total. We can do this by multiplying 288 with 264, which gives us:  288 x 264 = 75,552 grams of rice. Now, let's calculate how much food is wasted when some students eat more than their share. If 10% of the students eat 10% extra (i.e., 28.8 grams), then the amount of waste would be:  28.8 x 264 = 7,392 grams. So, the total amount of food available for all students is:  75,552 - 7,392 = 68,159 grams. Finally, we need to divide this total by the number of students who did not eat extra (i.e., 264) to find out how much food each student got:  68,159 / 264 = approximately 256 grams per student.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who will be able to eat lunch if each student is given 457 grams of rice. To do this, we can use the formula: Total quantity = Number of students x Quantity per student. So, in this case, the total quantity of rice needed would be: Total quantity = 457 grams x Number of students. Now, let's find out how many students can be fed with 457 grams of rice. We know that there are 300 students in all, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Total quantity = 457 grams x 300 students. Simplifying and solving for the number of students, we get: Number of students = Total quantity / Quantity per student. Substituting the values, we get: Number of students = 457 grams / 457 grams. This simplifies to: Number of students = 1. Therefore, only one student can be fed with 457 grams of rice.
Response: 120 students are participating in the meal program, and they have to be given food at super speed. To do this, they need to eat together at the same time. So, if there are 120 students, then the number of times they will eat together is 120 x 3 = 360 meals per day. Now, let's calculate how much food they will need for each meal. If we assume that each student needs 500 grams of rice, 200 grams of lentils, and 100 grams of vegetables per meal, then the total amount of food required per day would be: Rice (500 g x 360 meals) + Lentils (200 g x 360 meals) + Vegetables (100 g x 360 meals) = 180,000 grams + 72,000 grams + 36,000 grams = 298,000 grams or approximately 298 kilograms. Therefore, the school needs to purchase around 298 kilograms of rice, lentils, and vegetables every day to feed their 120 students.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who will be able to join the meal plan if they all pay the super special price. To do this, we multiply the number of students in each category by the corresponding discount percentage (324 x 50%, 374 x 25%, and 128 x 10%). This gives us a total of:  324 x 50% = 162 374 x 25% = 93 128 x 10% = 12 8 Total = 370 So, there will be 370 students who can join the meal plan at the super special price. Next, we need to find out how much revenue the school will generate from these students. We can do this by multiplying the total number of students by the cost per student (Rs. 100). This gives us:  Revenue = 370 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 37,000 Finally, we need to find out what percentage of the original price the school is offering as a discount. To do this, we divide the discount amount (Rs. 37,000) by the original price (Rs. 50,000), and then multiply by 100. This gives us:  Discount Percentage = (Rs. 37,000 / Rs. 50,000) x 100 = 74% Therefore, the school is offering a discount of 74% on the original price of Rs. 50,000.
"Response:  Firstly, if 257 students are participating in the meal program and each student needs to be given Rs. 100 as financial assistance, then the total amount required for the entire program would be:  
Rs. 100 x 257 = Rs. 25,700  Secondly, if 120 students are joining the breakfast program and each student needs to be given Rs. 80 as financial assistance, then the total amount required for the breakfast program would be:  
Rs. 80 x 120 = Rs. 9600 Finally, if 97 students are joining the tomato program and each student needs to be given Rs. 70 as financial assistance, then the total amount required for the tomato program would be:  
Rs. 70 x 97 = Rs. 6930 Therefore, the grand total of all three programs is:  
Rs. 25,700 + Rs. 9600 + Rs. 6930 = Rs. 42,230"
Response:  Firstly, if 144 students are participating in a math competition and each student has to eat at least one meal per day, then the total number of meals required will be:  144 x 1 = 144 meals.  Secondly, if 467 students are participating in a menu competition and each student can only choose one dish from the menu, then the total number of dishes chosen will be:  467 x 1 = 467 dishes.  Finally, if there are 79 students who have enrolled for both competitions, then the total number of participants in both competitions combined will be:  144 + 467 + 79 = 680 participants.
"Response:  Firstly, if 220 students are participating in the meal program and each student is given $3.50 worth of food, then the total amount spent on food would be:  

$3.50 x 220 = $770  Secondly, if 337 students are receiving breakfast and each student is given $1.50 worth of breakfast, then the total amount spent on breakfast would be:  

$1.50 x 337 = $506.50 Finally, if 23 students are receiving tomato puree and each student is given $2.50 worth of tomato puree, then the total amount spent on tomato puree would be:  

$2.50 x 23 = $57.50 Therefore, the total amount spent on all three programs would be:  

$770 + $506.50 + $57.50 = $1,334 Total amount spent on all three programs = $1,334"
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who will be eating lunch in the canteen. We know that there are 450 students in the school and 380 students in the hostel, so the total number of students who will be eating lunch in the canteen is:  450 + 380 = 830  Next, we need to calculate the number of portions of food required for each student. We know that each portion costs Tk. 66, so the total amount of money required to buy food for all the students is:  830 x 66 = 56,980 taka Finally, we need to add an additional 10% to this amount as a contingency fund, which gives us:  56,980 x 1.10 = 62,776 taka Therefore, the total amount of money required to provide lunch for all the students in the school and hostel is Tk. 62,776.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who have scored above 70% in both subjects (Math and English). We can do this by multiplying the number of students who have scored above 70% in Math by the number of students who have scored above 70% in English. So, if 218 students have scored above 70% in Math and 351 students have scored above 70% in English, then the total number of students who have scored above 70% in both subjects would be:  218 x 351 = 76,488.  Next, we need to find out how many students have scored above 70% in either subject but not both. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who have scored above 70% in both subjects from the total number of students. So, the number of students who have scored above 70% in either subject but not both would be:  76,488 - 218 x 351 = 49,520. Therefore, there are 49,520 students who have scored above 70% in either Math or English but not both.
"Response:  Firstly, if 269 students are enrolled in a course and 330 students are waiting to be enrolled, then the total number of students who will be enrolled is:  

269 + 330 = 600 students.  Now, let's consider the scenario where 76 students have already been enrolled in another course. In that case, the remaining seats available for enrollment would be:  

600 - 76 = 524 seats available.  So, the supervisor needs to allot 524 seats among the 330 wait-listed students. If each student is given one seat, then:  

524 / 330 = 1.58 seats per student (approximately)  Therefore, the supervisor should allocate approximately 1.58 seats to each of the 330 wait-listed students."
Response:  We know that there are 569 boys in the school and 236 girls. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. Total number of students = 569 + 236 = 805 Subtracting 236 from 805 gives us: 805 - 236 = 569 So, there are 569 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 boys and 841 girls in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. Total number of students = 34 + 841 = 875 So, there are 875 - 34 = 841 more girls than boys.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 222 of them are boys. So, we can start by finding out how many girls are there in the school. Girls = Total - Boys Girls = 485 - 222 Girls = 263 Therefore, there are 263 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 boys in total and 220 girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we can find out how many boys are left.  697 - 220 =?  The difference between 697 and 220 is 477. Therefore, there are 477 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total and 510 boys. So, we can start by finding out how many girls are in the school. Girls = Total - Boys Girls = 635 - 510 Girls = 125 Therefore, there are 125 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and 281 boys. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we can find out how many girls are left.  Total Students = 868 Boys = 281 Girls =?  To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. 868 - 281 =?  The answer is:  868 - 281 = 587  Therefore, there are 587 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in total and 142 boys among them. So, we can find out how many girls are present in the school by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students. Total number of students = 700 Number of boys = 142 Therefore, the number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 700 - 142 = 558 So, there are 558 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 boys and 222 girls in the school. So, if we add both numbers together, we get:  706 + 222 = 928 Now, we know that there are 418 teachers in the school. So, to find out how many students there are in total, we can subtract the number of teachers from the total number of boys and girls:  928 - 418 = 510 Therefore, there are 510 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. If 44 more girls join the school, we need to find out how many students will be left after adding those 44 girls. To do this, we can use subtraction. So, let's subtract the number of girls who joined from the total number of girls: Total number of girls = 902 - (44) = 902 - 44 = 858 Now, we have found out that there will be 858 girls in the school after 44 more girls join. Similarly, we can calculate the number of boys in the school: Total number of boys = 811 + (44) = 811 + 44 = 855 Therefore, there will be a total of 858 girls and 855 boys in the school after 44 more girls join.
Response:  We know that there are 632 boys and 410 girls in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. Total number of students = 632 + 410 = 1042 Subtracting 410 from 1042 gives us: 1042 - 410 = 632 So, there are 632 boys in the school. Now, to find out how many more boys than girls, we need to compare the number of boys with the number of girls. In this case, there are 632 boys and 410 girls, so there are 632 - 410 = 222 more boys than girls.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. This means that the total number of students is 732 + 761 = 1493. Now, we know that 682 girls and 8 boys have joined the school. So, the total number of new students is 682 + 8 = 690. Therefore, the current number of girls in the school is 732 - 690 = 42. The current number of boys in the school is 761 - 8 = 753.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school. So, if we add both numbers together, we get:  135 + 214 = 359 students in the school. Therefore, there are 359 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, if we add both numbers together, we get:  308 + 318 = 626 students in the school. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are there in the school. The text tells us that there are 36 teachers. So, if we divide the total number of students (626) by the number of teachers (36), we can find out the average number of students per teacher:  626 ÷ 36 = 17.5 students per teacher. Therefore, there are approximately 17.5 students per teacher in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  315 + 309 = 624  Therefore, there are 624 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 402 boys in school and 739 students in total. So we can find out how many girls are in school by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students. 402 + 739 = 1141 1141 - 402 = 739 Therefore, there are 739 girls in school.
Response:  We know that there are 458 boys in the school and 692 girls in total. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we can find out how many girls are there in the school.  458 (boys) + 692 (girls) = 1150 Total Students Now, let's subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls: 1150 - 458 = 702 Girls in the School Therefore, there are 702 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  362 + 257 = 619 students in the school. Therefore, there are 619 students in the school, including both boys and girls.
Response:  First, we know that Edward gave 16 dollars to his daughter. So, if he had 18 dollars before giving money to his daughter, then he has 18 - 16 = 2 dollars left with him now. Therefore, Edward has $2 left with him after giving $16 to his daughter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward had $13 and he spent some amount of money. So, his current balance is $3 (given in the problem). Now, we need to find out how much money Edward spent. To do this, we can subtract the amount he currently has ($3) from the original amount he had ($13): $$ 13 - 3 = 10 $$ Therefore, Edward spent $10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward gave $9 to his friend and then he had $8 left with him. So, Edward had $8 + $9 = $17 with him. Now, if Edward spent $10, he would have $17 - $10 = $7 left with him. Therefore, the amount of money Edward had before spending $10 is $7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $92 left after spending $16. So, his remaining amount is:  $92 - $16 = $76 Now, he has to pay $6 more for the book. Therefore, the total amount he needs to spend is: $76 + $6 = $82 So, Edward had $82 with him before buying the book.
Response:  We know that each book costs $6 and there are two books in total. So, the total cost of both books is $6 + $6 = $12. Now, we want to find out how much each book costs individually. To do this, we can divide the total cost by the number of books: $12 ÷ 2 = $6 per book. Therefore, each book costs $6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of the book is Tk. 600 and the total amount paid by him is Tk. 1900. So, the difference between the two amounts is: Tk. 1300 = (Tk. 1900 - Tk. 600) Now, we need to find out how much money he had before buying the book. To do this, we can subtract the cost of the book from the total amount paid: Tk. 1300 = (Tk. 1900 - Tk. 600) Tk. 700 = (Tk. 1300 - Tk. 600) Therefore, he had Tk. 700 with him before buying the book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of both books is $12. So, if we subtract the cost of one book from the total cost, we can find out how much it costs for two books.  Cost of one book = $4 + $3 = $7 Total cost = $12 - $7 = $5 Therefore, the cost of two books is $5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of both books is Tk. 19000 (Tk. 16000 + Tk. 3000). Now, let's find out how much more the editorial board has to pay for the calamus than the paperback book. We can do this by subtracting the price of the paperback book from the total cost. So, the difference in price between the two books is: Tk. 19000 - Tk. 16000 = Tk. 3000. Therefore, the editorial board has to pay Tk. 3000 more for the calamus than the paperback book.
Response:  Firstly, Edward gave away $17 to his friends. Then he had $7 left with him. So, we can calculate as follows: 17 - 7 = 10 Therefore, Edward had $10 before giving away any money.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has done 44 push-ups in today's gym class. Secondly, Devid has done 58 push-ups more than Jackie. So, to find out how many push-ups Devid has done, we can use the following equation: Total number of push-ups = Number of push-ups done by Jackie + Number of push-ups done by Devid. Substituting the values, we get: Total number of push-ups = 44 + 58 = 102. Therefore, Devid has done 102 push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has taken 51 push-ups in today's gym class and Devid has also done 44 push-ups. Now, we need to find out how many more push-ups Jackie has done than Devid. To do this, we can subtract the number of push-ups done by Devid from the number of push-ups done by Jackie. So, 51 - 44 =?  Yes, you are correct! The difference is 7. Therefore, Jackie has done 7 more push-ups than Devid.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Debid has taken 44 push-ups in total. Secondly, we are told that he has done more than 9 push-ups. So, if we subtract 9 from 44, we get: 44 - 9 = 35 Therefore, Debid has done 35 push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Debid has done 51 push-ups in total. Secondly, we are told that Jacky has done more than 49 push-ups. So, if we subtract 49 from 51, we get: 51 - 49 = 2 Therefore, Debid and Jacky together have done 2 push-ups more than what Jacky has done. To find out how many push-ups they have done altogether, we add 2 to 49: 49 + 2 = 51 So, Debid and Jacky together have done 51 push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Devid has taken 59 push-ups and 44 crunches in total. Now, let's calculate how many push-ups he has done. We can do this by subtracting the number of crunches from the total number of exercises he has done:  59 - 44 = 15 push-ups. So, David has done 15 push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that David has taken 44 push-ups and 17 crunches in total. We also know that he has done more push-ups than crunches. So, let's calculate the number of push-ups first.  44 - 17 = 27 (push-ups) Now, we can calculate the number of crunches. 17 - 27 = 9 (crunches) Therefore, David has done 27 push-ups and 9 crunches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has taken 53 push-ups and 14 crunches today. We also know that she has done more push-ups than crunches. So, let's calculate the number of push-ups first.  53 - 14 =?  Yes, you are correct! The answer is 49. Now, let's calculate the number of crunches. 14 -? = 0 (since there are no more crunches left) Therefore, the final answers are: Number of push-ups: 49 Number of crunches: 0
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has taken 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in today's gym class. We also know that she has done 87 crunches less than her push-up count. So, if Jackie has done x push-ups, then she has done (x - 87) crunches. Now, let's find out how many crunches Jackie has done. We can set up an equation based on this information:  35 + (x - 87) = 87 To solve for x, we can first add 35 to both sides of the equation:  35 + (x - 87) + 35 = 87 + 35 This simplifies to:  2(x - 87) = 122 Subtracting 87 from both sides gives us:  2x - 174 = 122 Adding 174 to both sides gives us:  2x = 306 Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x = 153 Therefore, Jackie has done 153 push-ups and (153 - 87) = 66 crunches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has taken 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in total. We also know that she has done more push-ups than crunches. So, let's calculate the number of push-ups first.  46 - 38 = 18 (push-ups) Now, we can calculate the number of crunches as follows: 58 - 18 = 40 (crunches) Therefore, Jackie has done 18 push-ups and 40 crunches.
Response:  Firstly, Jackie scored 19 push-ups in total.  Of those, he did 39 push-ups from his knees (39 x 2 = 78). So, he did 78 push-ups with his knees. Next, he did 13 push-ups without using his knees (13 x 2 = 26). Therefore, Jackie did a total of 78 + 26 = 104 push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, Jackie scored 51 runs in today's cricket match.  Secondly, David scored 22 runs less than Jackie. Therefore, David scored 51 - 22 = 29 runs. Thirdly, John scored 4 runs less than David. So, John scored 29 - 4 = 25 runs. Finally, we need to find out how many runs Jackie and David scored together. We can do this by adding their scores: 51 + 29 = 80 runs.  So, Jackie and David scored 80 runs together.
Response:  Firstly, Jackie has done 15 push-ups in the gym class today.  Secondly, David has done 39 push-ups more than Jackie. Finally, John has done 9 fewer push-ups than David. So, we can calculate as follows:  15 + (39 - 9) =?  To find out how many push-ups Jackie has done, we add 15 to 39 and then subtract 9:  15 + 39 - 9 = 54. Therefore, Jackie has done 54 push-ups today.
Response:  We know that Devid has done 30 push-ups and Jacky has done 37 push-ups. So we can start by finding out how many more push-ups Jacky did than Devid. To do this, we subtract 30 from 37: 37 - 30 = 7. This means that Jacky did 7 more push-ups than Devid. Now we need to find out how many push-ups Devid did in total. Since he did 30 push-ups, we can simply say that Devid did 30 push-ups. Therefore, the answer is: Devid did 30 push-ups, and Jacky did 37 push-ups (7 more than Devid).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Devid has done 56 push-ups in Jim's class today. If he had done 38 push-ups, then the difference between the two numbers is: 56 - 38 = 18. So, Devid did 18 more push-ups than he would have if he had only done 38. Therefore, the total number of push-ups Devid and Jack together did is: 38 + 18 = 56.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jim has done 40 push-ups and Karim has done 17 crunches. Now, if Jim had done 34 push-ups and 62 crunches, then the total number of exercises he would have done is:  34 + 62 = 96  So, Jim would have done 96 exercises in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jiakar has 36 push-ups and 33 crunches. Now, if he does 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then how many more push-ups did he do than crunches? To find out, we need to subtract the number of crunches from the total number of push-ups. So, 58 - 33 =?  That's right! Jiakari did 25 more push-ups than crunches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has 27 push-ups and 7 crunches less than Devided. So, if Devided does 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, then Jackie will do 27 - 5 = 22 push-ups and 7 - 17 = 0 crunches. Therefore, Jackie will have done 22 push-ups and no crunches.
Response:  To calculate the number of glasses of water needed for each person in the household, we need to know how many people are there in the household and how much water each person needs.  We can start with the first part of the problem - finding out how many people are in the household.  Can you tell me how many members are there in your family?   Please respond with a numerical value.
Response:  To find out how many paragraphs are in the homework assignment, we need to know how many points there are in each of the three topics and how many sentences are in each paragraph.  Here is what we know so far:   Topic 1 has 3 points, and each point has 2-3 sentences.  Topic 2 has 4 points, and each point has 2-3 sentences.  Topic 3 has 5 points, and each point has 2-3 sentences.  So, if we multiply the number of points in each topic by the average number of sentences per point, we can estimate how many sentences there are in total.   For Topic 1, we have 3 x 2 = 6 sentences.  For Topic 2, we have 4 x 2 = 8 sentences.  For Topic 3, we have 5 x 2 = 10 sentences.  Total sentences = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 sentences.  Now, let's divide the total sentences by the number of paragraphs to find out how many sentences are in each paragraph.   We know that there are 4 paragraphs in the homework assignment.  Therefore, we can divide 24 sentences by 4 paragraphs to get the average number of sentences per paragraph.  24 sentences / 4 paragraphs = 6 sentences per paragraph.  So, there are approximately 6 sentences in each paragraph of the homework assignment.
"Response:  To calculate the number of pages that need to be printed for each homework assignment, we first need to determine how many assignments there are in total.  We know that there are seven assignments in all, and each assignment has five questions. Therefore, the total number of questions is 7 x 5 = 35 questions.  Now, let's consider the page layout. If we assume that each question takes up half a page (i.e., one side of an A4 sheet), then we can estimate that each assignment will take up approximately 35/2 = 17.5 pages.  So, to print all seven assignments, we would need to print 17.5 x 7 = 122.5 pages.  However, since we cannot print fractional pages, we round this value up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 123 pages.  Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many pages do I need to print for my homework?"" is 123 pages."
Response:  If Rechel can do 7 household chores in 4 hours at home, then she can do 1 household chore in:  4 hours / 7 chores = 0.57 hours (or approximately 34 minutes) per chore.
Response:  If three people are working from home and each person is taking breaks for 8 hours, then they will be taking a total of 24 hours of breaks (3 x 8). So, if we subtract the total break time from the workday, we get: Workday - Total Break Time = 8 hours/day x 5 days/week = 40 hours/week - 24 hours = 16 hours/week. Therefore, the amount of productive worktime per week would be 16 hours.
Response:  If Rechel can earn $8 per hour working at home and she works for 6 hours, then her total earnings for the day would be:  8 x 6 = 48 dollars.  So, if Rachel has to work for more than 6 hours to earn $48, how many more hours does she need to work? To find out, we can subtract the number of hours she worked (6) from the total hours she needs to work (8):  8 - 6 = 2 hours.  Therefore, Rachel needs to work for an additional 2 hours to earn $48.
"Response:  If Rechel can earn $10 per hour working at home, and she works for 3 hours, then her total earnings will be:  
$10 x 3 = $30  Now, if she spends 2 hours on household chores, she will have to work for an additional 2 hours to earn enough money to buy the items she needs. So, the total number of hours she needs to work to buy the items is:  
$30 / $10 per hour = 3 hours  Therefore, the answer is 3 hours."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages in each section - Homoewerk, Reading Homework, and BioLogy Homework. 1. Homoewerk: 2 pages x 5 sections = 10 pages 2. Reading Homework: 3 pages x 4 sections = 12 pages 3. BioLogy Homework: 10 pages x 2 sections = 20 pages Total number of pages = 10 + 12 + 20 = 42 pages So, the total number of pages that need to be copied is 42.
Response:  We know that there are 9 items in each homework assignment and 2 homework assignments per week. So, to calculate the total number of problems in one week, we need to multiply the number of items in each assignment by 2.  Total number of problems = 9 x 2 = 18 Now, let's find out how many pages this would be. Since each problem takes up approximately half a page (given that the problems are not too complex), we can estimate that each page will have roughly 4-5 problems. Therefore, 18 problems will take up approximately 18/5 = 3.6 pages.  So, the approximate number of pages for one week of homework is 3.6 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 11 types of gadgets in the homework list and 2 types of books in the homework list. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  11 + 2 = 13  Therefore, there were 13 items in total in the homework list.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages in the three books combined. We know that each book has 7, 11, and 8 pages respectively. So, the total number of pages is:  7 + 11 + 8 = 26 pages. Now, let's find out how many pages are left for the reader after reading all three books. To do this, we subtract the total number of pages from the original number of pages in each book:  26 - 7 = 19 (for Book 1), 26 - 11 = 15 (for Book 2), and 26 - 8 = 18 (for Book 3). Therefore, there are 19 + 15 + 18 = 52 pages left for the reader after reading all three books.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pages of content will be there in total for each subject if we include all the topics and subtopics.  For mathematics, there are 9 chapters with 11 topics each, so the total number of pages for mathematics would be:  9 x 11 = 99 pages  For science, there are 4 chapters with 5 topics each, so the total number of pages for science would be:  4 x 5 = 20 pages  For social studies, there are 3 chapters with 7 topics each, so the total number of pages for social studies would be:  3 x 7 = 21 pages  Therefore, the total number of pages for all three subjects combined would be:  99 + 20 + 21 = 140 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pages of grammar and vocabulary homework are there in total. We know that there are 8 pages of grammar homework and 7 pages of vocabulary homework. So, the total number of pages of grammar and vocabulary homework is:  8 + 7 = 15 pages. Next, we need to calculate how many pages of biology homework are there. We know that there are 3 pages of biology homework. So, the total number of pages of all three subjects' homework is:  15 + 3 = 18 pages. Therefore, the student has 18 pages of homework in total.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pages of the textbook are devoted to physics and biology respectively. We know that there are 50 pages in total, so we can divide it equally among the three subjects as follows: Physics - (50/3) = 16.67 pages Biology - (50/3) = 16.67 pages Now, let's find out how many pages each subject needs for homework. Homework assignments typically account for around 10% of the total page count. So, for physics, we have: Physics Homework - (16.67 x 0.10) = 1.67 pages Biology Homework - (16.67 x 0.10) = 1.67 pages Finally, we add up all the page counts to get the total number of pages needed for each subject: Physics - 16.67 + 1.67 = 18.34 pages Biology - 16.67 + 1.67 = 18.34 pages Therefore, the total number of pages needed for each subject is approximately 18-19 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of pages in Reader's Digest is 2 more than the number of pages in Ganitabarta. So, if Ganitabarta has p pages, then Reader's Digest will have p + 2 pages. Now, we are given that the total number of pages in both magazines is 40. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: p + (p + 2) = 40. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2p + 2 = 40. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: 2p = 38. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: p = 19. So, there are 19 pages in Ganitabarta and 19 + 2 = 21 pages in Reader's Digest.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rechel has prepared homework for four subjects - mathematics, science, English, and social studies. So, she has prepared 4 x 7 = 28 pages of homework in total. However, since she wants to give some extra work to her students, she has added another 19 pages of homework for each subject, which is 19 x 3 = 57 more pages. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework that Rechel has prepared for all three grades combined is 28 + 57 = 85 pages.
Response:  Jack has 6 apples in the morning and 2 apples in the evening. So, he has a total of 6 + 2 = 8 apples.
Response:  Jack has 6 eggs in the morning and 8 eggs in the evening. So, he has a total of 6 + 8 = 14 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has four images in his morning and he will have more than four images in the evening. So, the number of images Jack will have in the evening is greater than four. Now, we need to find out how many more images Jack will have in the evening compared to the morning. To do this, we can subtract the number of images Jack has in the morning (4) from the total number of images Jack will have in the evening. Total number of images Jack will have in the evening = Number of images Jack has in the morning + How many more images Jack will have in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of images Jack has in the morning and the number of images Jack will have in the evening is: Total number of images Jack will have in the evening - Number of images Jack has in the morning. Solving for the unknown variable, we get: Total number of images Jack will have in the evening - Number of images Jack has in the morning =? We know that Jack has four images in the morning, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Total number of images Jack will have in the evening - 4 =? Now, we need to determine the total number of images Jack will have in the evening. Based on the information provided, we know that Jack will have more than four images in the evening. So, let's assume that Jack will have x images in the evening, where x is a positive integer greater than 4. Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get: Total number of images Jack will have in the evening - 4 = x - 4. Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 4 =? The final answer is x - 4.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 6 imels in the morning, and he gives 3 to his friend as a gift. So, Jack has 6 - 3 = 3 imels left with him. Then, he buys 5 more imels in the afternoon, so now he has 3 + 5 = 8 imels in total. Therefore, Jack has 8 imels at the end of the day.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 5 apples in the morning and he eats 8 apples in total (i.e., 5 + 8 = 13). So, Jack has 13 apples left after eating.
Response:  Jack has eaten 4 eggs in the morning, 5 eggs in the afternoon, and 8 eggs in total. So, he has eaten a total of 4 + 5 + 8 = 17 eggs.
Response:  Jack has 3 images in his morning and 8 images in his evening. So, he has a total of  3 + 8 = 11 images.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has eaten 10 eggs in the morning. Then he has eaten 7 eggs in the afternoon and 17 eggs at night. So, in total, Jack has eaten 34 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 9 imels in the morning and he gives 10 imels to his friend as a gift. So, now Jack has 9 - 10 = 1 imel left with him. Now, if we calculate how many imels Jack has at night, it will be 1 x 7 = 7 imels. Therefore, Jack has 7 imels at night.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 10 images in the morning and he gives away 5 images to his friends. So, he has 10 - 5 = 5 images left with him in the morning. Now, let's see how many more images he has at night. At night, he has 5 images that he had in the morning plus the additional 4 images he received, so he has 5 + 4 = 9 images at night. Therefore, Jack has a total of 5 + 9 = 14 images throughout the day.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 6 imels in the morning and he gives 3 to his friend as a gift. So, Jack has 6 - 3 = 3 imels left with him. Now, if we consider the total number of imels that Jack has in a day, it will be 3 + 3 = 6 imels. Therefore, Jack has 6 imels in a day, and he gives 3 imels to his friend as a gift in the evening.
Response:  Jack had 3 eggs in the morning and 64 chicks. In the evening, he had 5 eggs and 54 chicks. To find out how many eggs Jack had in total, we need to add the number of eggs he had in the morning and the evening. So, Total eggs = 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, Jack had 8 eggs in total.
Response:  Firstly, Jack had 5 apples and 6 chocolates in the morning. Then, he had 9 apples and 7 chocolates in the evening. So, to find out how many chocolates Jack had in total, we need to add the number of chocolates he had in the morning and the evening. Therefore, the total number of chocolates Jack had is:  5 + 7 = 12 chocolates.
Response:  Firstly, Jack had 10 images in the morning and 12 images in the evening. So, he had a total of 10 + 12 = 22 images in the day. Now, if we subtract the number of images he had in the morning from the total number of images he had in the day, we get:  22 - 10 = 12 images that Jack took in the evening.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 6 images and 8 chits in the morning.  If he wins 2 more images in the evening, then he will have 6 + 2 = 8 images.  Now, let's count how many chits he will have after winning 2 more images.  8 (chits) x 2 (images won) = 16 chits So, Jack will have 16 chits in the evening.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has 6 impeccable images and 91 impressive words in his portfolio. After that, he adds two more impeccable images and 74 impressive words to his collection. So, if we subtract the original number of images and words from the total number of images and words after adding new ones, we get:   Original Images: 6   Original Words: 91  New Images: 2   New Words: 74 Now let's calculate the difference between the original and new numbers:  Difference in Images = (6 + 2) - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2  Difference in Words = (91 + 74) - 91 = 165 - 91 = 74 Therefore, Jack has added 2 new images and 74 new words to his portfolio.
Response:  Jack has four images in the morning and two images in the afternoon. In total, he has six images (4 + 2 = 6). He also has eight chapters to read in the evening (8). So, Jack reads a total of 6 + 8 = 14 pages today.
Response: 1) Jack has 9 images in his morning. 2) He sends 7 images in the evening. So, he has 9 - 7 = 2 images left in the morning. Now, let's calculate how many images he has in the evening: 2 x 3 (since there are 3 hours from 7 to 10 PM) = 6 images. Therefore, Jack has 6 images in the evening.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 5 apples in the morning and he gives 16 apples to his friend in the evening. So, the total number of apples Jack had in the morning is 5 + 16 = 21 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples Jack gave away in the evening. We know that he gave 16 apples to his friend. Therefore, the number of apples Jack has left after giving away 16 apples is 21 - 16 = 5 apples. Finally, we can say that Jack has 5 apples left with him at night.
Response:  Firstly, Jack has three eggs in the morning.  Then he buys six more eggs in the afternoon. So, now he has three + six = nine eggs in total. Finally, he gives five eggs to his friends as gifts. Therefore, Jack has nine - five = four eggs left with him.  So, the answer is four.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between two points (9,0) and (12,0) is given as 3 units. Now, we need to find out how far (12,0) is from the line y = 9x + b. To do this, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is any point on the line, and m is the slope. In this case, we have (x1, y1) = (9, 9), so we can write: y - 9 = m(x - 9). Simplifying, we get y = 9x + b, where b is the constant term. So, the distance between (12, 0) and the line y = 9x + b is simply |12 - 9| = 3 units. Therefore, the distance between (12, 0) and (9, 0) is also 3 units.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ghasfulkuñjar gave 31 inches of cloth to Bangali Mekhali and she made 35 inches of cloth from it. So, if we subtract 31 from 35, we get:  35 - 31 = 4 Now, we need to find out how much cloth did Bangali Mekhali give back to Ghasfulkuñjar. To do this, we can subtract the amount of cloth given by Ghasfulkuñjar (31) from the total amount of cloth made by her (35):  35 - 31 = 4 Therefore, Bangali Mekhali gave 4 inches of cloth back to Ghasfulkuñjar.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bandar has 17 inches more than Ghasfalak. So, if Ghasfalak has 36 inches, then Bandar will have 36 + 17 = 53 inches. Now, we are asked how far Mosu is from Bandar. Since Mosu is 15 inches less than Bandar, so Mosu will be at a distance of 53 - 15 = 38 inches away from Bandar. Therefore, the answer is 38 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ghasfalak has 25 inches of lawn. Then, we can see that Bangali Meghadaspat has 18 inches more than Ghasfalak. So, Bangali Meghadaspat has 25 + 18 = 43 inches of lawn. Finally, we know that Mos has 2 inches more than Bangali Meghadaspat. Therefore, Mos has 43 + 2 = 45 inches of lawn.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between Bandar and Ghasfalak is 19 inches. Now, we need to find out how far Mosu is from Bandar. We are given that Mosu is 20 inches away from Bandar. So, if we subtract 10 inches (the distance between Bandar and Ghasfalak) from 20 inches, we get: Distance between Mosu and Bandar = 20 - 10 = 10 inches Therefore, Mosu is 10 inches away from Bandar.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by each animal.  For this, we can use the formula: Total Distance = (Distance per day x Number of days) + (Distance per hour x Number of hours). Now let's apply this formula for each animal:  🐄 Horse: Total Distance = (20 km/day x 19 days) + (5 km/hour x 8 hours/day x 19 days) = 380 km + 720 km = 1100 km 🐃 Donkey: Total Distance = (15 km/day x 39 days) + (3 km/hour x 6 hours/day x 39 days) = 585 km + 1040 km = 1625 km 🐓 Goat: Total Distance = (10 km/day x 94 days) + (2 km/hour x 4 hours/day x 94 days) = 940 km + 1760 km = 2660 km So, the total distance traveled by the horse is 1100 km, by the donkey is 1625 km, and by the goat is 2660 km.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total distance traveled by all three is 100 inches. So, if we can find out how much each of them has traveled individually, we can get our answer. Now, we are given that Bandar traveled 32 inches more than Ghasfalak and Musa traveled 26 inches less than Bandar. We can start with Ghasfalak's travel distance. Since Bandar traveled 32 inches more than him, so Ghasfalak traveled for 25 inches (as given in the problem). Therefore, the total distance traveled by Ghasfalak and Bandar together is: 25 + 32 = 57 inches. Now, we need to find out how far Musa traveled. Since he traveled 26 inches less than Bandar, so his travel distance is: 57 - 26 = 31 inches. Therefore, Musa traveled for 31 inches. Finally, we can calculate the distance between Musa and Ghasfalak as follows: Distance between Musa and Ghasfalak = Total distance traveled by Musa + Total distance traveled by Ghasfalak Total distance traveled by Musa = 31 inches Total distance traveled by Ghasfalak = 25 inches Distance between Musa and Ghasfalak = 31 + 25 = 56 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of inches in the three lawns is 24 + 33 + 5 = 62 inches. Now, we need to find out how many feet are there in each lawn. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, we can convert the inches into feet as follows:  Ghaspalk (24 inches) = 24/12 = 2 feet Bangali Meghadaspot (33 inches) = 33/12 = 3 feet Mouse (5 inches) = 5/12 = 0.4 feet Therefore, the length of each lawn is: Ghaspalk - 2 feet Bangali Meghadaspot - 3 feet Mouse - 0.4 feet
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between two points (A and B) is given as: 

Distance = |AB| = sqrt((x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2) 

where (x_A, y_A) and (x_B, y_B) are the coordinates of points A and B respectively. 

Now, let's find out the coordinates of point A (the starting point). We know that it has an x-coordinate of 13 inches and a y-coordinate of 0 inches. So, the coordinate of point A is (13, 0). 

Next, let's find out the coordinates of point B (the ending point). We know that it has an x-coordinate of 2 inches more than the x-coordinate of point A and a y-coordinate of 2 inches less than the y-coordinate of point A. So, the coordinate of point B is (13 + 2, 0 - 2) = (15, 0). 

Finally, we can calculate the distance between point A and point B using the formula above: 

Distance = |AB| = sqrt((15 - 13)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = sqrt(4^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(16 + 0) = sqrt(16) = 4 inches. 

Therefore, the distance between point A and point B is 4 inches."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of eggs in the basket is 35. Secondly, we know that the hen gave 4 eggs more than her own eggs. So, if we subtract the number of eggs given by the hen from the total number of eggs, we will get the number of eggs laid by the hen. Therefore, the number of eggs laid by the hen can be calculated as follows: Total number of eggs = 35 Number of eggs given by the hen = 4 Subtracting the number of eggs given by the hen from the total number of eggs gives us the number of eggs laid by the hen: 35 - 4 = 31 Therefore, the hen laid 31 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ghasfalak has 19 inches of lava. Then, we can see that Meghadasa has 4 times more lava than Ghasfalak, so Meghadasa has 4 x 19 = 76 inches of lava. Now, let's find out how much less Maous has compared to Meghadasa. We know that Maous has 44 inches of lava, and we want to find out how many inches less it is compared to Meghadasa. To do this, we subtract the amount of lava in Maous from the amount of lava in Meghadasa: 76 - 44 = 32 inches. So, Maous has 32 inches less lava than Meghadasa.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total distance traveled by the hare is 39 inches + 19 inches = 58 inches. Now, we need to find out how much of this distance was covered by the mouse. We know that the mouse covered 12 inches less than the hare. So, if the hare covered 58 inches, then the mouse covered 58 - 12 = 46 inches. Therefore, the distance covered by the mouse is 46 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ghasfalak has 21 inches of lawn. Then, we can see that Bangali Meshador (BM) has 25 inches more than Ghasfalak's lawn. So, BM has 25 + 21 = 46 inches of lawn. Now, we are given that Mouse has 16 inches less than BM's lawn. Therefore, Mouse has 46 - 16 = 30 inches of lawn. Finally, we can say that Ghasfalak has 21 inches of lawn, Bangali Meshador has 30 inches of lawn, and Mouse has 30 inches of lawn as well.
Response:  We know that Bangladesh has 39 inches of rainfall and Hasalfak has 17 inches of rainfall. To find out how much more rainfall Bangladesh receives than Hasalfak, we need to subtract the amount of rainfall in Hasalfak from the amount of rainfall in Bangladesh. So, we can say that Bangladesh receives 39 - 17 = 22 inches more rainfall than Hasalfak.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total distance traveled by all three animals is 9 + 3 + 33 = 45 inches. Now, we need to find out how much Mus travelled beyond Bandar's distance. We know that Bandar traveled for 3 inches less than Ghasfalak. So, Bandar traveled for 9 - 3 = 6 inches. Therefore, Mus traveled beyond Bandar's distance by 6 inches. Hence, the answer is 6 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the mouse and the hole is 16 inches (16 ইঞ্ভ). Secondly, we know that the distance between the hole and the gas pipe is 37 inches (37 ইঞ্ণ). So, if we subtract the first distance from the second distance, we get: 37 - 16 = 21 inches. Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the gas pipe is 21 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 14 caps of flour and she gives 5 caps to her friend. So, the amount of flour left with Meri is:  14 - 5 = 9 caps Now, we need to find out how much more flour Meri needs to buy to make 6 cups of cake. We know that 1 cap of flour makes 2 cups of cake, so:  6 cups x 2/cap = 12 caps To get 12 caps of flour, Meri needs to buy:  12 - 9 = 3 caps of flour Therefore, Meri needs to buy 3 caps of flour to make 6 cups of cake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 9 caps of flour and she gives 4 caps to her friend. So, how much flour does Meri have left? We can calculate this as follows: Total flour = 9 caps x 2 cups/cap = 18 cups Now, let's find out how much flour is needed for the remaining recipe. The recipe requires 11 cups of flour in total. Therefore, the amount of flour required for the remaining recipe is: Remaining flour = 11 cups - 4 cups (given to friend) = 7 cups To find out how many more cups of flour Meri needs to buy, we subtract the amount of flour she has from the amount required for the recipe: More flour needed = 7 cups - 18 cups = -11 cups Since we cannot have negative amounts of flour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, Meri needs to buy 11 cups of flour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 6 cups of flour and she needs to make 8 cups of cake batter. So, she will need an additional 2 cups of flour (8 - 6 = 2). Now, let's calculate how much sugar and eggs she will need. We know that each cup of flour requires 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 eggs. Therefore, for 2 cups of flour, she will need 2 x 1/4 = 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. Finally, we can add up all the ingredients she needs: 2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 4 eggs. So, in total, Meri needs 2 + 1/2 + 4 = 7 1/2 cups of ingredients to make 8 cups of cake batter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 11 cups of flour and she needs to make 7 cups of cake batter using 2 cups of sugar and 3 cups of milk. So, she will have 11 - 7 = 4 cups of flour left after making the cake batter. Now, if she wants to make 2 more cups of chinni using 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of milk, she will need 2 x 2 = 4 cups of flour. Therefore, Meri will have 4 - 2 = 2 cups of flour left over. 
Response:  Firstly, Meri has 11 cups of flour and she needs to add 3 cups more for making dough. So, she will have in total: 11 + 3 = 14 cups of flour. Now, if she wants to make 6 more caps of dough, she will need 6 x 2 = 12 cups of water. Therefore, the total amount of water required is: 12 + 14 = 26 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has given 12 cups of rice and 5 cups of lentils to her daughter-in-law. So, if she gives 2 more cups of rice, she will have given a total of 12 + 2 = 14 cups of rice. Now, let's calculate how much money she will have spent in total. We know that each cup of rice costs ₹10, so the total cost of 14 cups of rice will be: 14 x ₹10 = ₹140. Similarly, since each cup of lentils costs ₹5, the total cost of 5 cups of lentils will be: 5 x ₹5 = ₹25. Therefore, the total amount of money Meri will have spent is: ₹140 + ₹25 = ₹165.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 3 kg of rice and she wants to make 9 kg of pulao. So, she needs to buy more rice. She can buy either 6 kg or 12 kg of rice to reach her target weight. Now, let's calculate how much money she will spend on rice based on these two options: Option 1 (buying 6 kg of rice): 6 kg x Rs. 40 per kg = Rs. 240 Total cost = Rs. 240 + Rs. 500 (for chicken) = Rs. 740 Option 2 (buying 12 kg of rice): 12 kg x Rs. 40 per kg = Rs. 480 Total cost = Rs. 480 + Rs. 500 (for chicken) = Rs. 980 Since Rs. 740 is less than Rs. 980, it makes sense for Tinu to buy 6 kg of rice instead of 12 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is: Tinu will need to buy 6 kg of rice to make 9 kg of pulao.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 10 packets of chili powder and 2 packets of cumin seeds. So, he has a total of 10 + 2 = 12 packets of spices. Now, according to the recipe, he needs 5 packets of chili powder and 14 packets of cumin seeds. Therefore, he will have to buy: 5 - 10 = 5 packets of chili powder and 14 - 2 = 12 packets of cumin seeds. In total, he will need to buy 5 + 12 = 17 packets of spices.
Response:  First, we know that Meri has 12 cups of flour and she needs to make 11 cups of dough. So, she will use up all her flour. Now, let's look at the other ingredients. She has 5 cups of water, which is enough for 11 cups of dough (since each cup of flour requires half a cup of water). Next, she has 49 cups of sugar, which is more than enough since she only needs 11 cups of dough. Finally, she has 11 cups of yeast, which is also enough since she needs only 11 cups of dough. Therefore, Meri can make 11 cups of dough using all the ingredients she has.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tina has 7 cups of flour and she needs to add more flour to make 10 cups of cake batter. So, she needs to add (10 - 7) = 3 cups of flour. Now, let's calculate how much sugar and eggs she needs to add to make the cake batter. We know that for every cup of flour, she needs to add 2 cups of sugar and 4 eggs. Therefore, she needs to add (3 x 2) = 6 cups of sugar and (3 x 4) = 12 eggs. Finally, we can calculate how much milk and butter she needs to add to the cake batter. For every cup of flour, she needs to add 80 ml of milk and 50 gm of butter. Therefore, she needs to add (3 x 80) = 240 ml of milk and (3 x 50) = 150 gm of butter. So, Tina needs to add 3 cups of flour, 6 cups of sugar, 12 eggs, 240 ml of milk, and 150 gm of butter to her cake batter to make 10 cups of cake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 12 cups of flour and she needs to make 7 cups of labang (bread). So, she will use 5 cups of flour for making bread (7 - 2 = 5). Now, let's calculate how much more flour she needs to add to make 2 more loaves of bread. To make one additional loaf, she needs 1 cup of flour (since each loaf requires 2 cups of flour). Therefore, she needs an additional 2 cups of flour to make two more loaves of bread. Hence, the total amount of flour required by Meri is: Total Flour Required = 5 + 2 = 7 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 6 cups of flour and she needs to make 8 cups of chapatis. So, she will need an additional 2 cups of flour (8 - 6 = 2). Now, let's calculate how much ghee she will need for making 8 chapatis. We know that each chapati requires 1/4 cup of ghee, so for 8 chapatis, she will need 8 x 1/4 = 2 cups of ghee. Since Meri already has 5 cups of ghee, she will have enough for making all 8 chapatis. Therefore, the answer is:  2 cups of ghee.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tina has 2 cups of tea and she wants to add 12 cups of milk to it. So, the total amount of liquid she will have is: 2 (cups) + 12 (cups) = 14 cups Now, we are given that Tina has 13 cups of sugar. To find out how much more sugar she needs, we can subtract the amount of sugar she already has from the total amount of liquid she will have: 13 (cups) - 14 (cups) = -1 cup Sugar So, Tina needs one more cup of sugar to make her tea sweet enough.
Response: 1st step: We know that Meri has 9 caps of ghee and she gives 4 caps to her friend. So, the amount of ghee left with Meri is: 9 - 4 = 5 caps.  2nd step: Now, we need to find out how much chini (sugar) Meri needs to add to the remaining ghee to make it into a sweet dish. According to the recipe, for every 1 cap of ghee, she needs to add 6 caps of sugar. So, for 5 caps of ghee, she needs to add: 5 x 6 = 30 caps of sugar. Therefore, the total amount of ingredients needed for the sweet dish is: 5 caps of ghee + 30 caps of sugar.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 6 cups of rice and she wants to distribute it equally among 3 people. So each person will get 6/3 = 2 cups of rice. Now, Meri has 2 cups of rice left which she wants to sell at Tk 9 per cup. So, she can sell 2 x 9 = 18 taka in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 11 cups of flour and she needs to make 5 cups of chinni (bread) and 14 cups of maida (flour). So, if she uses all her flour for making chinni and maida, how much flour will be left with her after making these two items? To find out, let's subtract the amount of flour used in making chinni and maida from the total amount of flour available with Meri. Total flour available = 11 cups Flour used in making chinni = 5 cups Flour used in making maida = 14 cups Now, let's subtract the flour used in making chinni and maida from the total flour available: 11 - 5 - 14 =? The correct answer is 2 cups. Therefore, Meri will have 2 cups of flour left with her after making 5 cups of chinni and 14 cups of maida.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 3 cups of rice and she wants to sell it at Tk. 10 per cup. So, her total earning from selling all the 3 cups will be:  3 x Tk. 10 = Tk. 30 Now, if she adds 5 more cups of rice to her existing stock, her new total amount of rice will be:  3 + 5 = 8 cups And, if she sells each cup at Tk. 10, her total earning from selling all the 8 cups will be:  8 x Tk. 10 = Tk. 80 But, she already had Tk. 30 with her, so her net gain from adding 5 cups of rice will be: Tk. 80 - Tk. 30 = Tk. 50 Therefore, Meri will gain Tk. 50 by adding 5 cups of rice to her existing stock.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 5 cups of rice and she gives 1 cup to her friend. So, after giving 1 cup to her friend, Meri is left with 4 cups of rice. Now, if Meri wants to give 12 more cups of rice to her friend, she will have to give away all the remaining 4 cups of rice. Therefore, Meri has given away a total of 5 + 12 = 17 cups of rice to her friend.
Response:  First, we know that Tina has 7 cups of flour and she needs to add 60 more cups of flour to make 6 batches of cake. So, she will need 60 + 7 = 67 cups of flour in total. Now, let's calculate how much sugar she will need for each batch of cake. We know that each batch requires 14 cups of sugar, so Tina will need 6 x 14 = 84 cups of sugar in total. Finally, let's calculate how many more cups of sugar Tina needs to buy. She already has 7 cups of sugar, so she needs 84 - 7 = 77 cups of sugar more.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 12 cups of rice and she wants to distribute it equally among 9 people. So, each person will get 12/9 = 1 3/9 cup of rice. Now, let's see how many cups of chicken Tinu needs to buy. She already has 10 cups of chicken, so she needs to buy 12 - 10 = 2 more cups of chicken. Therefore, Tinu needs to buy 2 cups of chicken in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tina has 6 caps of mayonnaise in total. She has already used 4 caps to make the cake batter. So, she has 6 - 4 = 2 caps of mayonnaise left. Now, if she wants to add more mayonnaise to the batter, she will have to use at least 3 more caps (as per the recipe). Therefore, the minimum number of caps she needs to add is 3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 9 caps of flour and she needs to make 4 cups of maida (assuming 1 cup = 250g). So, she will need 4 x 250g = 1000g of flour. Since she already has 9 caps of flour, she can use all of them to make the required amount of maida. Now, let's calculate how much more flour she will need to add to the dough to make it 40 kg in weight. We know that 1 cap of flour weighs 250g, so she needs to add: 40 kg - 9 x 250g = 40 kg - 2250g = 1850g more flour to the dough. Therefore, Meri needs to add 1850g / 250g per cap = 7.4 caps of flour to the dough to make it 40 kg in weight.
Response: 1st step: We know that Meri has 9 caps of rice and she gives 2 caps to her friend. So, now she has 9 - 2 = 7 caps of rice left.  2nd step: She needs 4 more cups of rice to make 3 cups of pulao for herself and her friend. Therefore, she will need 4 + 2 = 6 more cups of rice. Since she already has 7 caps of rice, she can use all of them to make 6 more cups of rice. Hence, the final answer is: Meri will have 7 x 6 = 42 cups of cooked rice after making pulao for both of them.
Response:  First, we know that Meri has 11 cups of rice and she wants to make 12 cups of cooked rice. So, she needs an additional 1 cup of uncooked rice (12 - 11 = 1). Now, let's calculate how much more water she needs to add to the 6 cups of water she already has to cook the additional 1 cup of rice. To do this, we can use the formula: Total Water Needed = (Total Rice Needed x Ratio of Water to Rice) + (Total Rice Needed x Ratio of Water to Cooking Time). Since Meri is using a 1:2 ratio of water to rice and 3 cups of water for every 2 cups of rice, we can calculate as follows: Total Water Needed = (12 x 2) + (12 x 3) = 24 + 36 = 58 cups of water. Therefore, Meri needs 58 cups of water in total to cook her 12 cups of rice.
Response: 10 cups of rice are needed for 4 people to eat 2 cups each. So, we need to calculate how many more cups of rice will be required if 4 more people join them. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups already consumed (2 x 4 = 8) from the total amount of rice available (7 + 10 = 17). Therefore, there will be 9 cups of rice left after 4 more people consume their share.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meri has 12 cups of rice and she wants to give 10 cups of rice to her friend. So, how many cups of rice will be left with Meri after giving 10 cups away? To find out, subtract the number of cups given away (10) from the total number of cups owned by Meri (12): 12 - 10 = 2. Therefore, Meri will have 2 cups of rice left after giving 10 cups away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 families in the neighborhood who have not left for their winter homes yet. If 60 families leave for their winter homes, then how many families will be left behind? To find out, we need to subtract 60 from 19. So, 60 - 19 =?  Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the answer?
Response: 1) Firstly, we need to find out how many families of 7 members each will be able to live in a house with 8 rooms if they share one room. We can do this by dividing 8 (rooms) by 7 (family size). 8/7 = 1 So, there will be 1 family of 7 members that can live in each room. Now, let's calculate how many families of 7 members each can live in the entire house. There are 8 rooms in total, and each room can accommodate 1 family of 7 members. Therefore, the total number of families that can live in the house is 8 x 1 = 8 families.  2) Next, we need to determine how many families of 7 members each will be able to live in the house during winter (shiital) if they share one room. To do this, we can use the same calculation as before: 8/7 = 1 So, there will be 1 family of 7 members that can live in each room during winter. Just like before, there are 8 rooms in total, and each room can accommodate 1 family of 7 members. Therefore, the total number of families that can live in the house during winter is also 8 x 1 = 8 families.  3) Finally, we need to subtract the number of families that can live in the house during winter from the total number of families that can live in the house to find out how many families will have to move out or find alternative housing arrangements. In this case, the difference between these two numbers is: 8 - 8 = 0 So, none of the families will have to move out or find alternative housing arrangements. All 8 families can stay in the house comfortably, regardless of whether it's summer or winter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 houses in total and each house has a garden of 14 square meters. So, the total area of all gardens is:  20 x 14 = 280 square meters Now, let's calculate how many families can be accommodated based on the size of each family. We know that an average family consists of 5 members, so:  280 / 5 = 56 families Can accommodate Based on this calculation, 56 families can be accommodated in the colony.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 85 families in the village and 22 of them have migrated to Africa. So, the number of families left in the village is:  85 - 22 = 63 families. Now, out of these 63 families, 37 have migrated to Europe. Therefore, the number of families still living in the village is:  63 - 37 = 26 families.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 families in the neighborhood. Secondly, if 42 people from these families go to Africa and return, then the total number of people who have gone to Africa will be 42 + 31 = 73. Now, if 31 people from the remaining 8 families go to Europe, then the total number of people who have gone to Europe will be 31 + 16 = 47. So, the final answer is 73 - 47 = 26. Therefore, 26 people are left in the neighborhood after all the travelers have returned.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 families in the village and each family has 4-7 members. So, the total number of people in the village is:  38 x (4+7) = 38 x 11 = 418 people. Now, if 47 families migrate to Africa and each family has 4-7 members, then the total number of people who migrate is:  47 x (4+7) = 47 x 11 = 527 people. Similarly, if 94 families migrate to Europe and each family has 4-7 members, then the total number of people who migrate is:  94 x (4+7) = 94 x 11 = 1034 people. Therefore, the total number of people who migrate from the village is:  527 + 1034 = 1561 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 families in total (38 - 20 = 18). Now, let's divide these families into two categories based on their location during winter and summer: Winter Location Summer Location Total Families 18 Families We can see that 12 families migrate from the cold region to the hot region during winter, while 6 families remain in the hot region. So, the number of families in the hot region during winter is: 6 Families Similarly, we can see that 6 families migrate from the hot region to the cold region during summer, while 12 families remain in the cold region. So, the number of families in the cold region during summer is: 12 Families Therefore, the total number of families in both regions combined is: 18 Families + 6 Families + 12 Families = 36 Families
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 families in the village and each family has an average of 5 members. So, the total number of people living in the village is 87 x 5 = 435. Now, if 12 new families join the village, the total number of families will be 87 + 12 = 99. Therefore, the total number of people living in the village after the arrival of the new families will be 99 x 5 = 495.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 families in the village during summer.  Secondly, we know that 59 families migrate to their winter homes during winter.  Thirdly, we know that 24 new families arrive in the village from other places during winter. Therefore, the total number of families in the village during winter can be calculated as follows: Total number of families = Number of families during summer + Number of migrated families - Number of new arrivals Total number of families = 49 + 59 - 24 = 84 families During winter, there will be 84 families in the village.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 families in the neighborhood who have not received any aid yet.  Secondly, we know that each family has an average of 4 members (including children and adults). Therefore, the total number of people in these 27 families is:  27 x 4 = 108 people.  Now, let's consider the fact that some families may have more than four members. To account for this, let's assume that each family has at least two children (i.e., two additional members beyond the four mentioned earlier). This means that the minimum number of people in each family is now six (2 children + 4 adults):  27 x 6 = 162 people.  So, the estimated number of people in the 27 families who have not received any aid yet is between 108 and 162 individuals.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 86 families in the village who have migrated from their homes due to cold weather. Now, if each family has an average of 4-5 members, then the total number of people who have migrated can be calculated as follows: Total number of people = Number of families x Average number of members per family Total number of people = 86 x 4 Total number of people = 344 So, approximately 344 people have migrated from their homes due to cold weather.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 families in the village and each family has 35 members on average. So, the total number of people in the village is:  41 x 35 = 1415  Now, let's consider the number of people who will migrate to Europe and Africa. We know that 35% of the population will migrate to Europe and 20% will migrate to Africa. So, the number of people who will migrate to Europe is:  1415 x 0.35 = 491  And the number of people who will migrate to Africa is:  1415 x 0.20 = 283  Therefore, the total number of people who will migrate from the village is:  491 + 283 = 774
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three established families in the village - the Hakims, the Khans, and the Sheikhs. Each of these families has two branches, making a total of six families. Now, during the winter season, two new families arrive in the village - the Mianzes and the Qureshis. So, the total number of families in the village during the winter season is:  6 (established families) + 2 (new families) = 8 families.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Palak has received 253 chocolate boxes as gifts on her birthday. Secondly, she has given away 70 chocolate boxes to her friends or classmates. So, how many chocolate boxes does Palak have left with her now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of chocolate boxes given away from the total number of chocolate boxes received. Total number of chocolate boxes received = 253 Chocolate boxes given away = 70 Now, let's subtract the given away chocolate boxes from the total received chocolate boxes: 253 - 70 =? The correct answer is: 183 chocolate boxes. Therefore, Palak has 183 chocolate boxes left with her after giving away 70 chocolate boxes to her friends or classmates.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 551 friends in total, and out of them, only 177 are online now. So, to find out how many people have wished Tinu on his birthday, we need to subtract the number of offline friends from the total number of friends. Therefore, the number of people who have wished Tinu on his birthday is:  551 - 177 = 374.
Response: 1st step: Total number of friends = (440 - 111) = 329.  2nd step: Number of friends who did not attend the party = 106.  3rd step: Remaining number of friends who attended the party = 329 - 106 = 223. So, there were 223 friends who attended the party.
Response: 16 - 2 = 14 (Tinu's friends gave him 213 chocolates) 14 - 1 = 13 (Tinu received 13 chocolates from his friends) So, Tinu received 13 chocolates in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Palak has 589 friends in her school. Now, if she loses 161 friends, how many friends will she have left? To find out, we can subtract 161 from 589: 589 - 161 =?  The answer is 428. So, Palak will have 428 friends left after losing 161 friends.
Response: 110 - 90 = 20 (Tinu's score after deducting 90 from 110) Now, let's find out how many more questions Tinu needs to answer correctly to catch up with his friend. To do this, we need to subtract the number of correct answers made by Tinu's friend (412) from Tinu's current score (20). So, 412 - 20 = 392 (The number of correct answers Tinu needs to make to catch up with his friend) Therefore, the answer is 392.
Response: 1) Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of candies that Tinu received from his friends during the school year. We know that he received 568 candies in total. 2) Next, we need to subtract the number of candies that Tinu gave away (332) from the total number of candies he received. Therefore, the net amount of candies that Tinu has is: Total candies received - Candies given away = 568 - 332 = 236 So, Tinu has 236 candies left with him after giving away some to his friends.
Response: 1) Firstly, we need to calculate the number of candies Tinu received from his friends. We know that he received 52 candies in total. So, if he has 492 candies left, then he must have given away (52 - 492 = ) 440 candies to his friends.  2) Now, let's find out how many more candies Tinu needs to collect to reach 535 candies. To do this, we subtract the number of candies he already has (492) from the target number (535): 535 - 492 = 43. So, Tinu needs to collect 43 more candies to reach his goal.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Palak has 521 friends and she has lost 66 items of her belongings. Now, let's calculate how many items are left with her. We can do this by subtracting 66 from 521. So, 521 - 66 =?  Yes, you are right! There are 455 items left with Palak (521 - 66).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Palak has 531 friends and 38 enemies. Now, if we subtract her enemies from her total number of friends, we get:  531 - 38 = 493 So, Palak has 493 friends left after deducting her enemies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Palak has 601 friends and 406 close friends. Now, let's calculate how many friends she will have after losing one friend. If she loses one friend, she will have 601 - 1 = 599 friends left. Similarly, if she loses another friend, she will have 599 - 1 = 598 friends left. And so on. Therefore, if Palak loses all her 406 close friends, she will be left with only 295 friends (598 - 406). So, the answer is 295.
Response: 1) Firstly, we know that Tinu has 291 friends on his birthday, and he has lost 315 friends in total. So, we can calculate the number of friends he had before his birthday as follows: Total friends - Lost friends = Current friends 315 - 315 = 291 Therefore, Tinu had 291 friends before his birthday.  2) Now, let's find out how many gifts he received on his birthday. We know that he received 91 gifts on his birthday. So, we can calculate the percentage of gifts he received as follows: (Number of gifts / Total friends) x 100% 91/291 x 100% = 31.38% Therefore, Tinu received 31.38% of the total gifts on his birthday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 267 friends on Facebook and he has accepted 308 friend requests. So, the difference between the number of friend requests he has received and the number of friends he has is:  308 - 267 = 41 Now, let's find out how many more friends Tinu has than his best friend. We know that his best friend has 308 friends, so if Tinu has more friends than his best friend, it means he must have at least 309 friends (since 308 is the maximum number of friends his best friend can have). Therefore, the difference between the number of friends Tinu has and the number of friends his best friend has is:  309 - 308 = 1 Finally, we need to find out how many more friends Tinu has in total. To do this, we add up the two differences we found earlier: 41 + 1 = 42 So, Tinu has 42 more friends in total than his best friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 457 students in the school and out of them, 320 can speak English fluently. Now, let's calculate how many students cannot speak English fluently. We can do this by subtracting the number of fluent speakers from the total number of students. So, the number of students who cannot speak English fluently is:  457 - 320 = 137  Therefore, only 137 students cannot speak English fluently among the 457 students in the school.
Response: 11 customers visited the restaurant, and 3 of them ordered only three dishes. So, there were 8 customers who did not order any of those three dishes. Now, we need to find out how many of these 8 customers ordered more than three dishes. We know that each table can seat four people, so if there are eight customers who did not order any of the three popular dishes, then they must have ordered at least one dish each (since they cannot leave without ordering anything). Therefore, the total number of dishes ordered by these eight customers is 8 x 1 = 8. Since three dishes were ordered by three customers, the total number of dishes ordered is 8 + 3 = 11.
Response: 1) There were three customers in total. 2) Three customers left. So there are only four customers now (3 + 1 = 4).
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 customers and then 3 more customers came in. So, the total number of customers now is 9 + 3 = 12. Therefore, the number of customers who left was 12 - 9 = 3.
Response: 14 - 5 = 9. So there are 9 people left in the queue.
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 customers and 4 new customers arrived. So, the total number of customers now is 13 + 4 = 17. Now, we are told that 9 customers have left, so the number of remaining customers is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, 8 customers have left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 12 customers in the store. Then, 15 new customers came to the store. So, the total number of customers now is 12 + 15 = 27. Now, 14 of those new customers purchased something, so the number of remaining customers (i.e., the ones who did not purchase anything) would be 27 - 14 = 13. Therefore, there are currently 13 customers in the store who have not made any purchases yet.
Response:  We know that there were initially three customers (A, B, and C). Now, A and B have left, so there are only two customers left - C and D. Since D is a new customer, there must be at least one more new customer, let's call her E. So, in total, there are now three new customers (E, F, and G) who have arrived after A, B, and C left. Therefore, the number of new customers who have arrived is 3.
Response: 1st step - 8 customers left, so there were initially 8 - 8 = 0 customers. 2nd step - 5 customers came in, so now there are 0 + 5 = 5 customers. 3rd step - 99 new customers arrived, so now there are 5 + 99 = 104 customers in total. Therefore, a total of 8 + 5 + 99 = 112 customers have come to the restaurant.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 12 customers and now there are 14 customers (including the new ones). So, the number of new customers is 14 - 12 = 2. Now, if we subtract the original 12 customers from the total number of customers, we get: Total Customers = New Customers + Original Customers Total Customers = 2 + 12 Total Customers = 14 Therefore, there are 14 customers in total, including the original 12 and the two new ones.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $2 on something and has $3 left with him. So, he had $2 + $3 = $5 in total. Now, if he spent $2 on something, then he must have been left with $5 - $2 = $3. Therefore, the amount of money Dan had before spending $2 is $3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four candles in total. Secondly, three of those candles have melted and only one is left. So, if we divide the remaining candle into equal parts, we can calculate how much each part represents. In this case, since there are three melted candles, each part will represent 1/3 of the remaining candle. Therefore, the height of each part will be: Height = 4/3 = 1 1/3 (one and one-third) feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four candles in total and each candle has been burned for 99 minutes. So, the total time all the candles have been burned is: 4 x 99 = 396 minutes Now, we need to find out how much wax was consumed during this period. We know that one candle consumes 10 grams of wax per hour. Therefore, the total amount of wax consumed can be calculated as follows: 396 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6.6 hours x 10 grams/hour = 66 grams Wax consumption = 66 grams
Response:  We know that each candle bar has a price of $3 and there are two candle bars in total. So, the total cost is:  2 x $3 = $6  Therefore, the cost per candle bar is:   $6 / 2 = $3 per candle bar.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 2 candles and she burns each candle for 3 hours. So, in total, she burns 6 hours of candles (2 x 3 = 6). Now, let's calculate how many candles she needs to buy if she wants to light them for 8 hours. To do this, we need to find out how many more candles she needs to buy so that she can light them for 8 hours instead of 6 hours. We can do this by subtracting the number of hours she already burns candles from the total number of hours she wants to light candles. In this case, we have 8 - 6 = 2 hours. Therefore, Tinu needs to buy 2 more candles so that she can light them for 8 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are seven candles in total. Secondly, two of them are in one canister and three are in another. So, if we subtract the number of candles in each canister from the total number of candles, we get: Total Candles - Candles in Canister 1 = 7 - 2 = 5 Total Candles - Candles in Canister 2 = 7 - 3 = 4 Now, let's find out how much money is left after buying these canisters. We know that each canister costs Tk. 200, so: Money Left = (Total Cost of Candles) - (Cost of Canister 1) - (Cost of Canister 2) = (5 x 200) + (4 x 200) = 1000 + 800 = 1800 Taka Therefore, there is 1800 taka left after buying both canisters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 4 candles and she wants to buy one more candle. So, the total number of candles Tinu will have is:  4 + 1 = 5 Now, we are given that each candle costs ৳60. So, the total cost of all the candles for Tinu will be:  5 x ৳60 = ৳300 Next, we are asked how much money Tinu spent on the cande
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 6 candies and he gives 3 candies to his friend. So, the number of candies left with Tinu is:  6 - 3 = 3 Now, we need to find out how much money Tinu will get for 3 candies. We know that each candy costs 2 taka, so:  3 x 2 = 6 taka Therefore, Tinu will get 6 taka for 3 candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 5 dals (dal is a unit of weight). He sold 2 dals at Rs. 10 each and 3 dals at Rs. 8 each. So, let's calculate how much money he made from selling 2 dals at Rs. 10 each:  2 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 20 Now, let's calculate how much money he made from selling 3 dals at Rs. 8 each:  3 x Rs. 8 = Rs. 24 Total amount of money Tinu made = Rs. 20 + Rs. 24 = Rs. 44 Therefore, Tinu made Rs. 44 in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 8 candies and gives 5 to his friend. So, he has 8 - 5 = 3 candies left with him. Now, if each candy costs 4 taka, then the total amount of money Tinu has is 3 x 4 = 12 taka.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of candle bar is $3. If the price increases to $4, then the new cost per unit will be: New Cost = Old Cost x (New Price / Old Price) New Cost = $3 x ($4 / $3) New Cost = $3 x 1.33 New Cost = $4 Now we have found out that if the price of candle bar increases from $3 to $4, the new cost per unit will be $4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $4 in total and he spends $3 on two candies. So, how much money does Dan have left after buying the candies? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount of money = $4 Amount spent on candies = $3 Therefore, Balance = Total amount of money - Amount spent on candies = $4 - $3 = $1 So, Dan has $1 left after buying the two candies.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spends $3 on two candies. So, how much money will he have left after buying the candies? To find out, we can subtract the amount he spent ($3) from the amount he had originally ($4): $$$ 4 - 3 = $1$$ Therefore, Dan will have $1 left after buying the two candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 5 dals of rice and she gives 3 dals to Chakleet. So, Tinu has 5 - 3 = 2 dals left with her. Next, we know that Tinu sells 7 dals of candies at a price of taka 10 per dal. Therefore, the amount of money Tinu earns from selling candies is 7 x 10 = 70 taka. Now, let's calculate how much money Tinu spends on buying candies. She buys 3 dals of candies at a price of taka 10 per dal, so she spends 3 x 10 = 30 taka. Finally, we can find out how much money Tinu has after buying candies by subtracting the amount she spends from the amount she earns: 70 - 30 = 40 taka. Therefore, Tinu has 40 taka after buying candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 4 dalers of candies and she wants to sell them at a profit of 20%. So, if she sells each candy for 10 taka, then she will have to sell all 4 dalers of candies to get 4 x 10 = 40 taka. Now, let's calculate how much profit she will make. Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit = 40 taka - (4 x 10) = 40 taka - 40 taka = 0 taka. Therefore, Tinu will not make any profit by selling her candies at 10 taka per piece.
Response: 115 books were sold at a garage sale for $78. To find out how many books are left, we need to subtract the number of books sold from the total number of books. Total number of books = 115 x 78 = 9,230 (rounded off) Number of books left = 9,230 - 115 = 9,115 So there are 9,115 books left after selling 115 books at a garage sale for $78.
Response: 137 books were sold at a garage sale for $500. If there are 105 books left unsold, then we can calculate how many books were initially available for sale. We know that the total number of books was 137 + 105 = 242 books. So, there were 242 - 137 = 105 books initially available for sale.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gyaraj sold 35 books to his friend at Tk. 62 each. So, the total amount of money he received from his friend is:  35 x 62 = 2190 Taka.  Next, we know that Gyaraj bought 108 books at Tk. 45 each. So, the total amount of money he spent on buying those books is:  108 x 45 = 5070 Taka. Now, let's find out how much profit or loss Gyaraj made in this transaction. To do so, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he received: Profit/Loss = Received - Spent  Profit/Loss = 2190 - 5070 = -2880 Taka. Since the result is negative, it means that Gyaraj suffered a loss of Tk. 2880 in this transaction.
Response: 151 books are in the garage of a person who has 50 books in his/her bag. So, to find out how many books the person has in total, we need to add the number of books in the bag and the number of books in the garage. Therefore, the total number of books the person has is: Total = 50 + 151 = 201 books.
Response: 150 books were sold at a garage sale for $5 each. So, the total amount earned from the sale was:  150 x $5 = $750. Now, if 58 books are left, then the number of books that were bought and resold is:  58 - 150 = 92 books. Therefore, the profit made from reselling the books is:  92 x ($5 - $3) = 92 x $2 = $184.
Response: 15 - 4 = 11 books are left after selling 42 books. Now, we need to find out how many new books Tinu has bought. We know that she has 15 books in total. So, if she had 15 books and sold 42 books, then she must have bought (42 - 15) = 27 new books. Therefore, Tinu has bought 27 new books.
Response: 1) The number of books in his collection before buying new ones is given as 71. 2) He bought 38 new books. So, the total number of books he had after buying new ones is: 71 + 38 = 109. 3) Now, the number of books he has (according to the question) is 116. So, the difference between the number of books he has now and the number of books he had before buying new ones is: 116 - 109 = 7. Therefore, the number of books he has purchased since then is 7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 108 books and 55 kalams in the garage. Now, if we subtract the number of books sold from the total number of books, we get: Total number of books - Number of books sold = 108 - x Where x is the number of books sold. We also know that the number of kalams sold is equal to the number of books sold, so we can write another equation: Number of kalams sold = Number of books sold. Therefore, our system of equations looks like this: 108 - x = 55 (1) x = y (2) where y is the number of books sold. To solve for x, we can substitute equation (2) into equation (1): 108 - x = 55 + y 108 - x = 63 + y Solving for x, we get: x = 45 Books Sold: 45 Kalams Sold: 45 Since the number of kalams sold is equal to the number of books sold, the number of kalams sold is also 45.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 51 books and 106 columns in the garage sale. Now, if Tinu sold 82 books and 14 columns, then he has remaining books and columns as follows:   Remaining Books = 51 - 82 = 39 (since 82 books were sold) Remaining Columns = 106 - 14 = 92 (since 14 columns were sold) So, Tinu has 39 books and 92 columns left after selling 82 books and 14 columns.
Response: 136 books - 27 books =? To find out how many books Tinu has sold, we need to subtract the number of books she still has (27) from the total number of books she had (136). So, Tinu has sold: 136 - 27 = 109 books.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 134 books in total. Secondly, Raju gave 39 books to his friend as a gift. Thirdly, he sold some books at the garage sale and got 68 books back. So, if we subtract the number of books Raju sold from the total number of books, we get: Total Books - Sold Books = 134 - 68 = 66 books. Therefore, Raju has 66 books left with him after the garage sale.
Response: 13 books and 22 pens were sold at the garage sale. If there were initially 95 books and 153 pens, how many books and pens were left unsold? Books: 95 - 13 = 82 (left unsold) Pens: 153 - 22 = 131 (left unsold)
Response:  We know that there were 42 books and 133 pens in the garage sale. If each book cost $5 and each pen cost $1, how much money did the seller make from selling these items? First, let's calculate the total amount of money made from selling books: Total amount of money made from selling books = Number of books x Price per book Total amount of money made from selling books = 42 x 5 Total amount of money made from selling books = $210 Now, let's calculate the total amount of money made from selling pens: Total amount of money made from selling pens = Number of pens x Price per pen Total amount of money made from selling pens = 133 x 1 Total amount of money made from selling pens = $133 So, the total amount of money made from both books and pens is: Total amount of money made = Total amount of money made from selling books + Total amount of money made from selling pens Total amount of money made = $210 + $133 Total amount of money made = $343 Therefore, the seller made $343 from the garage sale.
Response: 10 goats were given to Jessica as full payment for her farm produce. From Jessica's bag of 8 goats, she gave 2 more goats to Fuldaani as partial payment. So, how many goats are left with Fuldaani now? Solution: We know that Jessica had 10 goats and gave 2 to Fuldaani, so the number of goats left with Fuldaani is: 10 - 2 = 8 goats. Therefore, there are 8 goats left with Fuldaani.
"Response:  We know that each ""ভে"" is equal to 2, so we can start counting from there.  2 + 2 = 4, and then 4 + 2 = 6.  Therefore, the total number of ""ভে""s in the given string is 6."
"Response:  We know that each ""ভে"" is equal to 2, so we can start counting from there.  2 + 2 = 4, and then 4 + 2 = 6.  Therefore, the total number of ""ভে""s in the given string is 6."
Response:  Jessica has 33 gold coins and she gives 15 gold coins to Beje as gifts. So, Jessica has 33 - 15 = 18 gold coins left. Now, Beje has 15 gold coins that he received from Jessica + 3 gold coins that he had before (from his father) = 15 + 3 = 18 gold coins. Therefore, the total number of gold coins possessed by Jessica and Beje together is 18 + 18 = 36 gold coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 34 gold coins and she lost 15 coins. So, she has 34 - 15 = 19 gold coins left with her. Now, if she wants to buy 15 more gold coins, she will have to pay 15 x 20 = 300 gold coins in total. But she only has 19 gold coins with her, so it is not possible for her to buy 15 more gold coins. Therefore, the answer is 0 (zero).
"Response:  We know that each ""ভে"" is equal to 2, so we can start counting from there.  2 + 2 = 4, and then 4 + 2 = 6.  Therefore, the total number of ""ভে""s in the given string is 6."
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 gols in the bag and now there are 21 gols in the bag. So, we can find out how many more gols are in the bag by subtracting 12 from 21.  21 - 12 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 more gols in the bag than before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 15 toys in total, and she gave 6 of them away as gifts. So, the number of toys left with her is:  15 - 6 = 9 Now, we are told that she has 17 toys left, so we can set up an equation:  9 + x = 17 where x is the number of toys given away as gifts. Solving for x, we get:  x = 8 Therefore, Jessica gave away 8 toys as gifts.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 12 bottles of shampoo and 2 bottles of conditioner in her bag. She gave some shampoo and conditioner to her friends. We are told that she has 10 bottles of shampoo and 21 bottles of conditioner now. So, let's calculate how many bottles of each item she gave away.  Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles of shampoo and conditioner Jessica had initially. Total number of bottles of shampoo = 12 Total number of bottles of conditioner = 2 Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles of each item Jessica has now. Total number of bottles of shampoo now = 10 Total number of bottles of conditioner now = 21 Subtracting the initial amount from the current amount gives us: Number of bottles of shampoo given away = 10 - 12 = -2 (since she has fewer bottles now than she did initially) Number of bottles of conditioner given away = 21 - 2 = 19 Therefore, Jessica gave away 2 bottles of shampoo and 19 bottles of conditioner.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 5 goats and 3 sheep in the farm. Jessica sold 2 goats and 1 sheep from her father's farm. So, after selling, there will be 5 - 2 = 3 goats left in the farm, and 3 - 1 = 2 sheep left. Now, if we add the number of goats and sheep together, we get: 3 + 2 = 5 animals left in the farm. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 animals (goats and sheep) are left in the farm after Jessica sold some of them.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 7 goats and 12 chickens in the farm. Jessica sold some of the goats and chickens to reduce their number. We are given that after selling some goats and chickens, now there are 11 goats and 20 chickens left in the farm. So, let's start by finding out how many goats Jessica sold. To do this, we need to subtract the number of goats she has now (11) from the initial number of goats (7). This gives us: 7 - 11 = -4 Now, we know that Jessica sold 4 goats. Next, we can find out how many chickens she sold by subtracting the number of chickens she has now (20) from the initial number of chickens (12): 12 - 20 = -8 Now, we know that Jessica sold 8 chickens. Therefore, the total number of animals Jessica sold is: 4 goats + 8 chickens = 12 animals
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 19 gold coins in total and she spent 3 gold coins to buy a bag of apples. So, the number of gold coins left with her is:  19 - 3 = 16 Now, if she had 3 gold coins less than what she actually had, then she would have:  16 - 3 = 13 gold coins left with her. Therefore, the correct answer is: Jessica has 13 gold coins left with her after buying a bag of apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 13 gold coins and 84 silver coins in her bag.  Next, we are told that she gave some gold coins to her friends. We don't know exactly how many, but we do know that after giving them away, she had 91 silver coins left. So, let's subtract the number of silver coins she had before giving any away from the total number of silver coins she had:  91 - 84 = 7 Now, we need to find out how many gold coins she gave away. To do this, we can subtract the number of gold coins she had before giving any away from the total number of gold coins she had:  13 - 7 = 6 Therefore, Jessica gave away 6 gold coins to her friends.
"Response:  We know that each ""ভে"" is equal to 2, so we can start counting from there.  2 + 2 = 4, and then 4 + 2 = 6.  Therefore, the total number of ""ভে""s in the given string is 6."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 6 bottles of juice and 20 cookies in the bag. Jessica took out some more items from the bag, leaving behind 21 cookies and 22 bottles of juice. Now, if we subtract the number of cookies taken by Jessica (20) from the total number of cookies (21), we get: Total number of cookies left = 21 - 20 = 1 So, there are 1 cookie left in the bag. Similarly, if we subtract the number of bottles taken by Jessica (6) from the total number of bottles (22), we get: Total number of bottles left = 22 - 6 = 16 So, there are 16 bottles of juice left in the bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 9 goats and 6 arkids in Jessica's farm.  Next, we are told that some more goats and arkids were added to the farm from Jessica's bag. So, let's assume that the number of goats added was x and the number of arkids added was y. Now, we can write an equation based on the information given:  9 + x = 13 (total number of goats) 6 + y = 8 (total number of arkids) We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Solving the first equation for x, we get: x = 4 (since 9 + 4 = 13) Similarly, solving the second equation for y, we get: y = 2 (since 6 + 2 = 8) Therefore, the total number of goats now in the farm is: 9 + 4 = 13 And the total number of arkids now in the farm is: 6 + 2 = 8
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin had 17 inches of chul (length) and he felled 5 inches of it. So, his remaining length of chul is:  17 - 5 = 12 inches. Now, if he has to fell another 3 inches of his chul, his total fallen length will be:  12 - 3 = 9 inches. Therefore, Robin has fallen 9 inches of his chul.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin has been in jail for 20 days and he was released today. So, if his sentence was 10 months, how many days did he spend in jail before his release?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of days he spent in jail (20) by the number of months he was sentenced to (10). This gives us:  20 days / 10 months = 2 days per month Therefore, Robin spent 2 days in jail before his release.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin had 16 inches of chul (length) and he felled 11 inches. So, his remaining length is:  16 - 11 = 5 inches.
Response:  If Robin had 18 inches of hair and cut off 3 inches, then he has 15 inches (18 - 3 = 15) of hair left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin has fallen from a height of 13 inches (13 x 2 = 26 feet). Now, if he had fallen from a height of 14 inches instead, his total distance fallen would have been: Total Distance = Height x 2 = 14 x 2 = 28 feet. So, the difference in distance between the two scenarios is: Difference = 28 - 26 = 2 feet. Therefore, if Robin had fallen from a height of 14 inches instead of 13 inches, he would have fallen an additional 2 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin had 14 inches of chul (length) and he gave 8 inches to his friend as a gift. So, after giving away 8 inches, Robin was left with 6 inches (14 - 8 = 6). Now, if we subtract another 20 inches from this remaining length, we get:  6 - 20 = -14 inches. Therefore, Robin's current length is negative 14 inches (-14).
Response: 12 bottles of juice are in Danir's bag. He has given 53 bottles to Park. So, how many bottles of juice are left with Danir? To find out, we need to subtract the number of bottles given to Park from the total number of bottles. Total number of bottles = 12 (in Danir's bag) + 53 (given to Park) = 65 bottles. Now, we can calculate the number of bottles left with Danir by subtracting 53 from 65: 65 - 53 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 bottles of juice left with Danir.
Response: 1) Danir has 21 bottles of water in his backpack. 2) He gives 5 bottles to each of his friends. So he gives away 5 x 3 = 15 bottles.  Now, how many bottles does Danir have left?  15 - 15 = 0! Danir has no more bottles left in his backpack.
Response:  Firstly, Dani had 63 caps of bottled water and he gave away 51 caps to his friends. So, after giving away those caps, Dani was left with 63 - 51 = 12 caps of bottled water. Now, if we add the new 33 caps that Dani has received, then the total number of caps that Dani has is 12 + 33 = 45 caps. Therefore, the answer is 45.
Response: 1) Danish has 36 caps in his park. 2) He has given away 35 old bottles to the poor. So he has 36 - 35 = 1 cap left in his park.
Response:  Danie has 42 caps in his park now. He had 63 caps before and sold 30 of them. So, he has 63 - 30 = 33 caps less than before. Therefore, Danie has 42 - 33 = 9 caps more than before.
Response:  Dan has 22 caps and 8 repairs. He gives 6 caps to each of his friends, leaving him with 16 caps. So, he had 22 - 6 = 16 caps initially.
Response:  Firstly, Dan has 22 caps and 30 repairs. So, he has a total of 52 items (22 + 30). Now, if we subtract the number of caps he had before from the total number of items he has now, we get:  52 - 17 = 35  Therefore, Dan has 35 more items than he did before.
Response:  Dan has 30 caps and 14 repairs in his park. He needs to add 7 more caps and 86 more repairs to reach the goal of having 50 caps and 200 repairs. So, he needs to add: 7 (caps) + 86 (repairs) = 93 more items to his park.
Response:  Dan has 11 bottles of water and 28 repairs in his backpack. If he gives 6 bottles of water to each person, then he will have 11 - 6 = 5 bottles left. And if he gives 28 repairs to each person, then he will have 28 - 28 = 0 repairs left. So, Dan can give (5 x 3) = 15 bottles of water and (0 x 3) = 0 repairs to three people.
Response:  Dan has 71 bottles of wine and 24 replicas of famous paintings. He wants to sell his collection to buyers who are interested in buying both wine and artwork together. If each bottle of wine costs $50 and each replica painting costs $200, how much money will Dan make if he sells all of his items? First, let's calculate the total value of Dan's wine collection: 71 bottles x $50 per bottle = $3,550 Next, let's calculate the total value of Dan's artwork collection: 24 replicas x $200 per replica = $4,800 Now, let's add the values of both collections to find out the total amount of money that Dan can make from selling his entire collection: $3,550 + $4,800 = $8,350 So, Dan can potentially make $8,350 if he sells all of his items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 10 bottles of water and 62 reparations in total. Now, he has given away 27 bottles of water and 43 reparations to others. So, how many bottles of water does Dan have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of bottles of water he gave away from his initial total. We can do this by subtracting 27 from 10, which gives us: 10 - 27 = -17 (since negative numbers indicate less than). Therefore, Dan has -17 bottles of water left. However, since we cannot have negative bottles of water, we will round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up -17 to 0 bottles of water left for Dan. Similarly, we can calculate the number of reparations Dan has left by subtracting the number of reparations he gave away from his initial total. We can do this by subtracting 43 from 62, which gives us: 62 - 43 = 19. Therefore, Dan has 19 reparations left.
Response:  Danish has 66 caps and he lost 30 caps in the park. So, he has 66 - 30 = 36 caps left with him. Now, if he gives 25 caps to his friend, he will be left with 36 - 25 = 11 caps. Therefore, the number of caps that Danish had at first is 11.
Response:  We know that Danir has 32 bottles of water and he wants to distribute them equally among 25 people. So, if we divide 32 by 25, we get: 32 ÷ 25 = 1 2 Therefore, each person will receive 12 bottles of water from Danir.
Response: 1st step: Danish bought 60 caps from Park. So, he had 60 - 58 = 2 new caps.  2nd step: He sold 67 caps in total. So, he had 2 + 67 = 69 caps at the end. Therefore, the correct answer is 69.
Response: 1) Danie has 60 caps in total (given). 2) He sold 6 caps to Park (given). 3) So he has 60 - 6 = 54 caps left with him.  Now, if we divide 54 by 5, we get 10 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, Danie can sell 10 caps to Park and still have 4 caps left with him.
Response:  Danie has 54 old caps and buys 48 new caps. So he has a total of 54 + 48 = 102 caps. Now, if he sells 52 caps at 30 taka each, then his earnings will be:  52 x 30 = 1560 taka.
Response:  Dan has 82 caps and 29 repairs. He has given away 42 caps and 61 repairs. So, he has 82 - 42 = 40 caps left. And he has 29 - 61 = 3 repairs left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 66 caps and 39 repairs. Now, if he gives 16 caps to someone, he will have 50 caps left (66 - 16 = 50). And if he gives 8 repairs to someone, he will have 31 repairs left (39 - 8 = 31). So, in total, Dan has 50 caps and 31 repairs left after giving 16 caps and 8 repairs to someone.
Response:  Dan has 46 caps and 50 repairs. He needs to repair 21 more caps and buy  52 more repairs. So he will have in total: 46 + 52 = 98 caps and repairs.
Response:  Dan has 65 caps and 5 repairs. He needs to repair 31 caps and buy 9 more repairs. So, he will have 65 + 9 = 74 caps in total.
Response:  Dan has 58 caps and 25 repairs in his bag. He wants to distribute them equally among 11 people so that each person gets an equal number of caps and repairs. We can start by dividing the total number of caps into 11 parts.  58 / 11 = 5.27 (round off to nearest whole number) So, each person will get 5 caps. Now let's divide the total number of repairs into 11 parts. 25 / 11 = 2.27 (round off to nearest whole number) So, each person will get 2 repairs. Therefore, Dan will have 5 caps and 2 repairs left after distributing them equally among 11 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has 15 bottles of water and 18 repairs of food. So, if he wants to store all his resources in capsules, how many capsules will he need? To calculate this, we can use the formula: Total number of capsules = (Number of bottles x Number of repairs) / (Capacity of each bottle x Capacity of each repair). Now, let's find out the capacity of each bottle and each repair. We know that each bottle contains 2 liters of water, so the capacity of each bottle is 2 liters. Similarly, each repair contains 0.5 liters of food, so the capacity of each repair is 0.5 liters. Therefore, the total number of capsules needed to store all of Dan's resources would be: Total number of capsules = (15 x 18) / (2 x 0.5) = 90 / 1 = 90 capsules.  Since Dan already has 67 capsules and 35 bottles of water, he needs an additional 90 - 67 = 23 capsules to store all of his resources.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 11 apples and he gives 7 to Steve. So, Steve now has 7 + 1 = 8 apples. Now, if Jack had given him only 6 apples instead of 7, then Steve would have had 6 + 1 = 7 apples. Therefore, the difference between the actual number of apples Steve received (7) and the number he would have received if Jack had given him only 6 (7 - 6 = 1) is equal to the number of apples Jack still has (1). Hence, Jack still has 1 apple left after giving 7 to Steve.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 7 fewer apples than Jill. So, if Jill has x apples, then Jack has x - 7 apples. Now, we are told that Jill has 14 more apples than Jack. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:  14 = x - (x - 7) To solve for x, first add 7 to both sides of the equation:  21 = x - x + 7 21 = 8x - 7 13 = 8x We divide both sides by 8 to find x:  x = 16  So, Jill has 16 apples and Jack has 9 apples (16 - 7).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 less people in Jack's team than in Jill's team. So, if Jill's team has 13 more people than Jack's team, then the number of people in Jill's team is:  13 + 18 = 31  Now, we need to find out how many people are in Jack's team. To do this, we subtract the number of people in Jill's team from the total number of people: Total number of people - Number of people in Jill's team = 19 - 31 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 people in Jack's team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 5 jillers (gold coins) and each jiller is equal to 10 paisa. So, Jack has a total of 5 x 10 = 50 paisa. Now, if Amar gives him 3 more jillers, then Jack will have a total of 5 + 3 = 8 jillers. Each jiller is equal to 10 paisa, so Jack will have a total of 8 x 10 = 80 paisa. Therefore, the answer is 80 paisa.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 lesser animals in Jack's stable than in the total number of animals in the stable. So, if there are x animals in the stable, then there are x - 12 animals in Jack's stable. Now, we know that there are 11 more animals in Jill's stable than in Jack's stable. Therefore, the number of animals in Jill's stable is (x - 12) + 11 = x + 1. Finally, we know that there are 4 animals in Jack's stable. So, the total number of animals in both stables combined is x + 1 + 4 = x + 5. Therefore, the answer is x + 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 7 less than 16 i.e., 16 - 7 = 9. So, Jack has 9 pets. Now, let's find out how many more pets Jill has compared to Jack. We know that Jill has 9 more than Jack i.e., 9 + 9 = 18. Therefore, Jill has 18 pets in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 less people in Jack's team than in Jill's team. So, if Jill's team has 8 more people than Jack's team, then the number of people in Jill's team is:  8 + 7 = 15.  Now, we know that there are 16 people in total in both teams combined. Therefore, the number of people in Jack's team is:  16 - 15 = 1.  So, there are 1 person in Jack's team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of students in Jack's class is less than 20. So, let's start with 18 (the maximum possible value). Now, we know that 16 students are present in Steve's class. So, if we subtract 16 from 18, we get:  18 - 16 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 more students in Jack's class than in Steve's class. Since Steve has 16 students, Jack must have 18 + 2 = 20 students in his class. 
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 6 apples and each apple costs $2. So, he has a total of 6 x $2 = $12. Now, if Jill has 18 apples and each apple costs $3, then she has a total of 18 x $3 = $54. If Jill gives 5 apples to Jack, then she will have 18 - 5 = 13 apples left. Therefore, Jack has 12 + 5 = $17 worth of apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 5 pcs of pens in his bag. Secondly, we know that he has 18 more pens than Steve. So, if Steve has x pcs of pens, then Jack has (x + 18) pcs of pens. Finally, we are told that there are 87 pcs of pens in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: (x + 18) + 87 = 5 We can simplify this equation as follows: x + 18 + 87 = 5 x + 95 = 5 Solving for x, we get: x = 42 Thus, Jack has 42 pcs of pens in his bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 16 apples in total and he gives 5 apples to each of his friends. So, he has 16 - 5 = 11 apples left. Now, if Jill has 12 apples, she will have 12 + 5 = 17 apples in total. Therefore, Jack has 11 apples less than Jill.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 12 apples and 79 oranges in total. So, if he gives 14 apples to Steve, then Jack will have 12 - 14 = 0 apples left. Now, let's calculate how many oranges Jack will have after giving 14 apples to Steve. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples given (14) from the total number of oranges (79): 79 - 14 = 65. Therefore, Jack will have 65 oranges left after giving 14 apples to Steve.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 13 apples and 3 apes. So, he has a total of 13 + 3 = 16 fruits. Now, we are told that in his garden, there are 9 apple trees and 8 ape trees. Therefore, the number of apple trees is 9, and the number of ape trees is 8. Next, we need to find out how many apples and apes are in each tree. We know that each apple tree bears 4 apples, so there are 9 x 4 = 36 apples in all the apple trees. Similarly, each ape tree bears 2 apes, so there are 8 x 2 = 16 apes in all the ape trees. Finally, we add up the total number of apples and apes to get the grand total. The total number of apples is 36, and the total number of apes is 16. Therefore, the grand total is 36 + 16 = 52 fruits. So, Jack has 52 fruits in his garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 less than Jack's age and 8 more than Jill's age. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 6 + x = Jill's age... 2019-05-31 · The difference between the ages of Jack and Jill is 8 years. If Jack is 6 years younger than Jill, then Jill's age is 8 + 6 = 14 years older than Jack. Therefore, Jill's age is 14 + 6 = 20 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 less than Jack's age and 10 more than Jack's age. So, we can write: 3 < Jack's age < 10. Now, we know that Jack is 12 years old, so we can substitute this value into the inequalities:  3 < 12 < 10. Simplifying these inequalities, we get:  9 < 12 < 8. Solving for the range of values, we find that:  9 <= Jack's age <= 8. Therefore, the number of people who are older than Jack but younger than 15 is 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 12 apples in total. Secondly, we know that he has given 4 apples to his friend. So, the number of apples left with Jack is:  12 - 4 = 8 Now, we are told that Jill has 67 apples more than what Jack has. Therefore, we can say that Jill has:  67 = (8 x some integer) Some integer can be found out by dividing 67 by 8. 67 / 8 = 8 with remainder 5 So, the integer is 5 and Jill has 5 more apples than Jack. Finally, we can find out how many apples Jack has by adding the integer to the original number of apples he had:  8 + 5 = 13 Therefore, Jack has 13 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 12 apples in total and he gives 8 apples to Stiven. So, the number of apples left with Jack is 12 - 8 = 4. Now, we need to find out how many apples are there in each jar. We know that Stiven has 3 jars and each jar contains 8 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples in all three jars is 3 x 8 = 24 apples. Finally, we need to subtract the number of apples left with Jack (4) from the total number of apples in all three jars (24) to get the number of apples in the third jar. So, the answer is: Number of apples in the third jar = 24 - 4 = 20 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 19 apples in total. Secondly, he gives 12 apples to Jill. So, the number of apples left with Jack is:  19 - 12 = 7 Now, we need to find out how many apples Jill has. We know that she receives 12 apples from Jack. Therefore, the total number of apples Jill has is:  12 + (7) = 12 + 7 = 19 Apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 14 apples in total. Of these, he gives 6 to his friend and keeps 3 for himself. So, the number of apples left with Jack is:  6 + 3 = 9 Now, let's find out how many apples are left with Jill. We know that she gets 3 apples from Jack. Therefore, the total number of apples left with Jill is:  3 + (3 x 2) = 3 + 6 = 9 So, there are 9 apples left with Jill.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 84 apples and 10 pears. So, let's subtract the number of pears from the total number of fruits he has:  84 - 10 = 74 Now, we are told that Jack has 13 pears and 52 apples in his basket. So, let's add these numbers to what we have just found out:  74 + 13 + 52 = 149 Therefore, Jack has 149 fruits in his basket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 13 apples and 17 pies. Now, if he gives 8 pies to his friend, then he will have 13 - 8 = 5 apples left. So, Jack has 5 apples left after giving 8 pies away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has $8 in his wallet and he spends $4 on snacks. So, after buying snacks, Jack will have $8 - $4 = $4 left in his wallet. Now, let's see how much money Jack needs to buy the items from the store. According to the list, Jack needs to buy 3 apples at $2 each, which means he needs to spend $6 on apples. Additionally, Jack needs to buy 2 pencils at $1 each, which means he needs to spend another $2 on pencils. Therefore, the total amount of money Jack needs to spend is $6 + $2 = $8. Since Jack already has $4 in his wallet, he can use that money to pay for the items he needs to buy. So, the remaining amount of money Jack needs to spend is $8 - $4 = $4. Hence, the answer is $4.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 3 less apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jack has x - 3 apples.  Secondly, we know that Steve has 4 more apples than Amy. So, if Amy has y apples, then Steve has y + 4 apples.  Now, let's find out how many apples Jack has in total. We can do this by adding up the number of apples he has and the number of apples Steve has.  Therefore, the total number of apples Jack has is:   x - 3 + (y + 4) = x + y + 7  Finally, we need to find out how many apples are left with Steve after giving some to Jack. To do this, we subtract the number of apples Jack has from the total number of apples Steve has:  Steve has x + y + 7 apples, but gives jack x - 3 apples, so he has:  x + y + 7 - x + 3 = y + 4 apples left with Steve.  Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many apples does Steve have?"" is:  y + 4."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 78 wallets in total and each wallet contains $15 on average. So, the total amount of money in all the wallets is:  78 x $15 = $1230 Now, we know that one supermarket has 15 dollars less than the others. So, if we subtract $15 from the total amount, we get: $1230 - $15 = $1215 Therefore, there is $1215 left after deducting $15 from the total amount.
Response: 1) The cost of 78 dollars is calculated as follows: $78 x 3 = $234 (since there are three units). 2) Now we need to find out how much money was spent in total if 33 dollars were paid for each unit. Total amount spent = $234 x 3 = $692. So the total amount spent would be $692.
Response: 100 dollars x 148 = 14800. So Tina has made $14800 from her supermarket business.
Response: 1) The cost of 3 dal (rice) is Tk. 49. 2) After adding supermarket profit, the price becomes Tk. 60 per kg. 3) So, the total amount of money earned by selling 49 kg rice at Tk. 60 per kg will be:  49 x 60 = 2940 taka.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has spent 91 dollars from his wallet on something. So, he has 53 dollars left in his wallet (53 - 91 =). Now, if he spends 14 dollars more on supermarket purchases, he will have 53 - 14 = 40 dollars left in his wallet. Therefore, the amount of money Tinu has spent on supermarket purchases is 14 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 49 dollars in his supermarket account and he spent 106 dollars on groceries there. So, the amount of money he spent at the supermarket is:  106 - 49 = 57 dollars. Now, let's find out how much money he has left after spending at the supermarket. We can do this by subtracting the amount he spent at the supermarket from his total amount of money: Total Amount of Money = 26 + 57 = 83 dollars Left After Spending at Supermarket = 83 - 57 = 26 dollars Therefore, Tinu has $26 left after spending at the supermarket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia has 29 dollars and she spends 54 dollars in total. So, the amount she spent is 54 - 29 = 25 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia has $38 in her wallet and she spends $128 on a new laptop. So, how much money does she have left after buying the laptop?

Response: 19 - 5 = 14. So there are 14 apps left on his phone.
Response: 12 apps were installed on the phone before 5 apps remained. So, there were 12 - 5 = 7 apps left on the phone after the remaining 5 apps were uninstalled.
Response: 10 apps were installed on the phone initially. Then, 11 new apps were added. So, in total, there are 10 + 11 = 21 apps installed on the phone now. Out of these, 4 apps have been removed from the phone. Therefore, the number of apps left on the phone is 21 - 4 = 17.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 21 apps in Debasish's phone before he deleted 89 apps. So, the number of apps left after deleting 89 is:  21 - 89 = -68 (since we cannot have negative numbers of apps) Now, let's find out how many new apps Debasish has installed. We are given that he has installed 24 new apps. So, the total number of apps currently in Debasish's phone is:  68 + 24 = 92 apps. Therefore, the answer is 92.
Response: 15 apps were installed on the phone before, and now there are 7 new apps added. So, in total, there are 22 apps installed on the phone (15 + 7). Out of these, 4 apps have been removed from the phone, leaving us with 18 apps that are currently installed (22 - 4 = 18). Therefore, the number of apps that have been removed is 4, and the number of new apps added is 7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 16 apps and 77 files in the phone before deleting some of them. Now, after deleting 5 apps and 22 files, there are 5 apps and 45 files left in the phone. So, to find out how many apps were deleted, we need to subtract the number of apps left in the phone (5) from the total number of apps initially present (16). This gives us:  16 - 5 = 11 Apps were deleted.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 17 apps and 21 files in the phone. Now, if 3 apps and 7 files are missing from the list, then the remaining number of apps can be calculated as follows:  17 - 3 = 14 (remaining apps) And the remaining number of files can be calculated as follows:  21 - 7 = 14 (remaining files) So, there were 14 apps and 14 files left in the phone after the disappearance of 3 apps and 7 files.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 15 apps and 24 files in the phone before deleting some of them. So, if we subtract the number of deleted apps (10) from the total number of apps, we get: Total Apps = 15 - 10 = 5 Now, let's calculate the number of remaining files. We know that 24 files were present in the phone initially, and after deleting 4 files, there are 20 files left. Therefore, the number of remaining files is: Number of Remaining Files = 24 - 4 = 20 Finally, we can find out the number of apps and files that are still present in the phone as follows: Number of Apps Still Present = 5 Number of Files Still Present = 20
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 19 apps and 18 files in the phone. Now, if we subtract the number of apps that are still present (6) from the total number of apps (19), we get:  19 - 6 = 13 So, there are 13 apps missing from the phone. Similarly, if we subtract the number of files that are still present (5) from the total number of files (18), we get:  18 - 5 = 13 So, there are 13 files missing from the phone as well.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 17 apps in the phone before some of them were uninstalled. After uninstalling some apps, there are now 18 apps left in the phone. So, if 10 apps were installed after some were uninstalled, then the number of apps installed is 10. Therefore, the correct answer is 10.
Response: 15 apps and 59 files were present in the phone before deleting some apps and files. After deleting 12 apps and 30 files, there are 3 apps and 29 files left. So, if we subtract the number of apps and files that were deleted from the total number of apps and files initially present in the phone, we get: Total number of apps initially = 15 Number of apps deleted = 12 Total number of apps remaining = 15 - 12 = 3 Total number of files initially = 59 Number of files deleted = 30 Total number of files remaining = 59 - 30 = 29 Therefore, 3 apps and 29 files remain in the phone after deleting 12 apps and 30 files.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 24 files in the phone and 13 apps. Now, if we subtract the number of apps from the total number of files, we get:  24 - 13 = 11 So, there are 11 files left after removing all the apps. However, we also know that some files were deleted, so we need to subtract that number from 11 as well. The question states that only 2 files were deleted, so let's subtract 2 from 11:  11 - 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 files remaining on the phone after deleting all the apps and some additional files.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 apps and 9 files in the phone. Now, let's count how many of those apps and files have been transferred to the new phone. We know that 5 files and 12 apps have been transferred. So, if we subtract the number of transferred files and apps from the total number of files and apps, we can find out how many apps and files are left in the old phone. Apps: Total - Transferred = Left (24 - 12) = 12 Left Files: Total - Transferred = Left (9 - 5) = 4 Left Therefore, there are 12 apps and 4 files left in the old phone.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 11 apps and 3 files in the phone before deleting some of them. So, if we subtract 2 (the number of apps deleted) from 11, we get 9 remaining apps. Now, let's talk about the files. We know that 3 files were deleted, so if we subtract 3 from 10 (the original number of files), we get 7 remaining files. Therefore, the total number of items left on the phone after deleting some of them is: 9 (remaining apps) + 7 (remaining files) = 16.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neli has 242 cards in total and she gave 136 cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Neli is:  242 - 136 = 106 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neli has 301 cards in total and currently she has 154 cards left. So, to find out how many cards she had before losing some, we need to subtract 154 from 301.  301 - 154 =?  Yes, you are right! The result is 147. Therefore, Neli had 147 cards before losing some of them.
Response:  We know that Nel had 528 cards in total and she gave away 11 cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nel is:  528 - 11 = 517 Now, we need to find out how many cards Nel has given to Jeff. To do this, we can divide the number of cards left with Nel by the number of cards she gave to Jeff:  517 ÷ 11 = 46 Therefore, Nel has given 46 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nel had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nel is 566 - x, where x is the number of cards given to Jeff. Now, we are told that Jeff had 234 cards before receiving any from Nel. So, the total number of cards possessed by both Nel and Jeff is: 566 - x + 234 = 798. Since all the cards have been accounted for, we can set up the equation: 566 - x + 234 = 798. Solving for x, we get: x = 105. Therefore, Nel gave 105 cards to Jeff. Now, the number of cards left with Nel is: 566 - 105 = 461. The number of cards left with Jeff is: 234 + 105 = 339.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neli has 309 regular cards and 356 joker cards in total. She has given away 149 joker cards and now has 356 - 149 = 207 joker cards left. Now, let's find out how many regular cards she has. We can do this by subtracting the number of joker cards from the total number of cards she had: 309 - 207 = 102 regular cards. So, Neli has 102 regular cards and 207 joker cards left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neli has 246 cards in total and she gave 114 cards to Jeff as a gift. So, the number of cards left with Neli is:  246 - 114 = 132 Now, we need to find out how many 10-card packs Neli has. We can do this by dividing the remaining cards (132) by 10:  132 ÷ 10 = 13 Therefore, Neli has 13 packs of 10 cards each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nel has 573 cards in total and he gave 195 cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nel is:  573 - 195 = 378 Now, we are asked how many cards Nel gave to Jeff. We can calculate it as follows:  195 / 2 (since there are two decks of cards) = 97 cards Therefore, Nel gave 97 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neli has 438 cards and 18 ten-card decks. Now, let's calculate how many cards she has in each deck. We can do this by dividing the total number of cards by the number of decks: Total cards = 438 cards Number of decks = 18 decks So, the number of cards per deck is: Cards per deck = Total cards / Number of decks Cards per deck = 438 cards / 18 decks Cards per deck = 24 cards per deck Now, let's find out how many tens Neli has in each deck. Since there are 10 cards in each deck, and since Neli has 24 cards per deck, she must have 24 x 10 = 240 tens in each deck. Therefore, the total number of tens Neli has is: Total tens = Number of decks x Number of tens per deck Total tens = 18 decks x 240 tens Total tens = 4320 tens Finally, to find out how many cards Neli has left after giving away 55 cards, we need to subtract the number of cards given away from her total number of cards: Cards remaining = Total cards - Number of cards given away Cards remaining = 438 cards - 55 cards Cards remaining = 383 cards Therefore, Neli has 383 cards left after giving away 55 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neli has 239 cards in total and she gave 38 cards to Jeff as a gift. So, the number of cards left with Neli is:  239 - 38 = 201 Now, we need to find out how many more cards Neli needs to buy to have exactly 376 cards (the desired number). To do this, we subtract the number of cards she already has from the desired number:  376 - 201 = 175 Therefore, Neli needs to buy 175 additional cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pakko had 19 kukis (rice cakes) and he gave 35 to his friends as gifts. So, if we subtract 35 from 19, we get:  19 - 35 =?  Yes, you are correct! The answer is 0. Pakko had no kukis left after giving them away as gifts.
Response:  We know that Paku has 28 coins in total and he spent 7 coins to buy something. So, how many coins does Paku have left? To find out, we can subtract 7 from 28: 28 - 7 =? Solution: 21. Therefore, Paku has 21 coins left.
Response: 1st step: Pakor had 40 puffed rice cakes (kuchis). He ate 2 of them. So, he has 40 - 2 = 38 kuchis left.  2nd step: Now, he bought 37 more kuchis. So, his total number of kuchis is 38 + 37 = 75. Therefore, there are 75 kuchis left with Pakor.
Response:  Pakoras had 25 pieces in total. Tinu ate 5 of them. Then he gave 3 more to someone else. So, how many pakoras did Tinu eat and give away? Solution:  First, let's calculate how many pakoras Tinu ate: 5 (pieces given to him) + 3 (pieces given away) = 8 pakoras. Now, let's find out how many pakoras Tinu has left after eating and giving some away: 25 - 8 = 17 pakoras. Therefore, Tinu ate 8 pakoras and gave away 3 pakoras, leaving him with 17 remaining.
Response:  Pakoras had 13 pieces in total. Tina ate 2 of them. So, there are 13 - 2 = 11 pieces left. Now, Tina bought 36 more pieces. So, the total number of pakoras that Tina has is 11 + 36 = 47.
Response:  Pakor has 40 cups of puffed rice. He gave away 5 cups to his friends and kept 13 cups with him. So, how many cups of puffed rice does Pakor have left? Solution: We know that Pakor had 40 cups of puffed rice initially. He gave away 5 cups to his friends, so he has 40 - 5 = 35 cups of puffed rice left with him. Therefore, the correct answer is 35 cups.
Response:  Pakor has 17 cups of puffed rice and he gives 14 cups to his friend as a gift. So, Pakor has 17 - 14 = 3 cups left with him. Now, if he wants to give each of his remaining three friends one cup of puffed rice, how many times will he have to distribute the puffed rice among them?  Solution: To find out how many times Pakor needs to distribute the puffed rice, we need to divide the number of cups he has (3) by the number of cups he gives to each friend (1). 3 ÷ 1 = 3 Therefore, Pakor needs to distribute the puffed rice three times among his three friends.
Response:  Pakor has 12 cups of puffed rice and he gives 16 cups to his friend as a gift. So, Pakor has 12 - 16 = 4 cups left with him. Now, if he wants to give 21 cups of puffed rice to his friend as a gift, then he will be left with 4 - 21 = -17 cups. Therefore, the answer is -17.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pakora had 22 mishti kukis and 75 labangyukti kukis in total. Secondly, we are given that he won 15 mishti kukis and lost 54 labangyukti kukis. So, to find out how many mishti kukis Pakora has left, we can subtract the number of mishti kukis he won from his initial number of mishti kukis:  22 - 15 = 7  Therefore, Pakora has 7 mishti kukis left. Similarly, to find out how many labangyukti kukis Pakora has left, we can subtract the number of labangyukti kukis he lost from his initial number of labangyukti kukis:  75 - 54 = 21  Therefore, Pakora has 21 labangyukti kukis left.
"Response:  We know that Paku has 9 mishti (sweet) cups and 6 labangyukta (spicy) cups. He has eaten 36 sweet cups and 3 spicy cups. So, how many sweet cups does he have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cups he has eaten from the total number of sweet cups he had.  Total sweet cups = 9 cups Eaten sweet cups = 36 cups Left sweet cups = 9 - 36 = 0! Yes, you heard it right; Paku has no more sweet cups left. Now let's check his spicy cups. Total spicy cups = 6 cups Eaten spicy cups = 3 cups Left spicy cups = 6 - 3 = 3! Paku has 3 spicy cups left."
Response:  Pakistani cricketer scored 37 runs and hit 11 fours. So, he scored 37 - 11 = 26 runs without any four. Therefore, the number of fours he hit is 11.

Response:  If Pakko has 36 cups of rice and gives 7 cups to his friend, then he will have 36 - 7 = 29 cups left with him.
Response:  Pakor has 36 cups of puffed rice and he gives 14 cups to his friend as a gift. So, Pakor has 36 - 14 = 22 cups of puffed rice left with him. Now, Pakor eats 10 cups of puffed rice. Therefore, the number of cups of puffed rice left with Pakor is 22 - 10 = 12 cups.
Response:  Pakor has 41 puffed rice cakes and gives 9 to his friend as a gift. So, he has 32 puffed rice cakes left (41 - 9 = 32). Now, if he eats 18 of them, he will have 14 puffed rice cakes left (32 - 18 = 14). Therefore, Pakor ate 14 puffed rice cakes.
Response:  Pakor had 6 cups of puffed rice and he gave 30 cups to his friend. So, Pakor has 6 - 30 = 24 cups of puffed rice left with him. Now, if he played 22 games, then he must have won 22 x 1 = 22 cups of puffed rice in those games. Therefore, the total number of cups of puffed rice that Pakor has is 24 + 22 = 46 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pakora had 97 biscuits and he gave 34 biscuits to his friend. So, the number of biscuits left with Pakora is:  97 - 34 = 63 Now, Pakora ate 15 biscuits and his friend ate 56 biscuits. Therefore, the total number of biscuits eaten by both of them is:  15 + 56 = 71 So, the remaining number of biscuits with Pakora is:  63 - 71 = -8 (Since the result is negative, it means there are no more biscuits left with Pakora.)
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pakora had 26 pieces of biscuit and he gave 14 pieces to his friend. So, the number of biscuits left with Pakora is:  26 - 14 = 12 Now, we need to find out how many more pieces of biscuit Pakora has to eat. We know that he ate 9 pieces. Therefore, the total number of biscuits eaten by Pakora is:  12 + 9 = 21 So, there are 21 pieces of biscuits left with Pakora.
Response:  Pakora had 39 mishti kukis and 6 labangyukti kukis in total. He played 22 labangyukti kukis and 32 mishti kukis. So, he played more mishti kukis than labangyukti kukis. Therefore, the number of mishti kukis that Pakora played is greater than the number of labangyukti kukis he played. To find out exactly how many more mishti kukis Pakora played, we need to subtract the number of labangyukti kukis from the total number of mishti kukis. Total Mishti Kukis = 39 + 6 = 45 Labangyukti Kukis Played = 22 Subtracting the number of labangyukti kukis played from the total number of mishti kukis gives us: 45 - 22 = 23 So, Pakora played 23 more mishti kukis than labangyukti kukis.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 40 mishti kukis and 25 labangyukti kukis in total. Secondly, we know that Tinu played 18 labangyukti kukis and 15 mishti kukis. So, to find out how many labangyukti kukis Tinu played more than mishti kukis, we need to subtract the number of mishti kukis he played from the total number of labangyukti kukis. In this case, it would be:  18 - 15 = 3. Therefore, Tinu played 3 more labangyukti kukis than mishti kukis.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Gouvenir gave 8 dollars to his mother as a gift. Secondly, his father gave him 5 dollars more than what he gave to his mother. So, if Gouvenir received $4 from his father, then he would have received a total of:  8 + 4 = 12 dollars. Therefore, the amount that Gouvenir's father gave to him is 12 - 8 = 4 dollars.
Response: 1st step: Goyen's mother gives him 3 dola as pocket money. 2nd step: His father adds 6 dolas more to it. Total amount = 3 + 6 = 9 dolas.  3rd step: If he spends 4 dolas, then the remaining amount will be: 9 - 4 = 5 dolas. So, his father will give him 5 dolas more as pocket money. Therefore, the total amount of pocket money Goyen will receive from his parents is: 5 + 3 = 8 dolas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Goyen has five dollars and his mother gives him seven dollars more. So, Goyen now has $5 + $7 = $12. Next, we are asked how much money Goyen's mother will give him if he spends four dollars. We can calculate this as follows: $12 - $4 = $8. Therefore, Goyen's mother will give him $8.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the father gave $5 to his son as a gift. So, the total amount of money that the son has is $5 + $2 = $7. Now, if the son spends $6 on buying things, he will be left with $7 - $6 = $1. Therefore, the mother gave her son $1 more than what she had given earlier. Hence, the correct answer is $1.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack had 20 marbles and gave two to Jill. So, after giving two marbles to Jill, Jack has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left with him. Now, if Jill has 2 marbles, then she has a total of 2 + 2 = 4 marbles with her. Therefore, in total, there are 18 (Jack) + 4 (Jill) = 22 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, Jack gave 20 marbles to Jasher. So, Jasher has 20 + 2 = 22 marbles now. Now, if we subtract the number of marbles that Jack took back (20), from Jasher's total number of marbles, we get:  22 - 20 = 2 marbles left with Jasher.  Therefore, there are 2 marbles left with Jasher after Jack took back 20 marbles.
Response:  If Tinu had 19 marbles before and lost 11, then he has 8 marbles left (19 - 11 = 8).
Response: 13 - 5 = 8 (Tinu had 13 marbles and lost 5 to Josh). So Tinu has 8 marbles left now.
Response: 15 marbles were in Jasher's possession initially. He lost 9 marbles and won 22 marbles back. So, he has a total of:  15 + 22 = 37 marbles Now, let's find out how many more marbles Jasher has than what he had before losing any. To do this, we subtract the initial number of marbles from the total number of marbles:  37 - 15 = 22 marbles Therefore, Jasher has 22 more marbles now than he did before losing any.
Response: 3 + 6 = 9 (Total number of marbles) 9 - 5 = 4 (Number of marbles left after losing 5 times) So, Tinu has lost 4 marbles in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko's weight is 4 pounds less than his father's weight. So, if his father weighs x pounds, then Marko weighs (x - 4) pounds. Secondly, we know that the total weight of Marko and his father together is 19 pounds. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: (x - 4) + x = 19. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x - 4 = 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 10.5. Now, we can find out how much heavier Marko's father is compared to him. We know that Marko's weight is 4 pounds less than his father's weight. So, if his father weighs 10.5 pounds, then Marko weighs 10.5 - 4 = 6.5 pounds. Therefore, Marko's father is 4 pounds heavier than him.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko and his father have a total of 35 pounds (35 x 2 = 70 pounds). Now, if we subtract the weight of Marko's father from their combined weight, we get the weight of Marko alone. So, 70 - 13 = 57 pounds. Therefore, Marko weighs 57 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko and his father have a combined weight of 20 pounds (17 + 3). Now, if we subtract the weight of Marko's father from their combined weight, we get the weight of Marko alone. So, 20 - 17 = 3, which means Marko weighs 3 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total weight of Marko and his father together. We know that Marko's weight is 8 pounds (3.6 kg) and his father's weight is 32 pounds (14.5 kg). So, the total weight of both of them together would be: Total weight = 8 + 32 = 40 pounds (18.1 kg) Now, let's find out how much the combined weight of Marko and his father is compared to the weight of just Marko's father alone. To do this, we can divide the total weight by the weight of just Marko's father: Combined weight / Father's weight = 40 / 32 = 1.25 Therefore, the combined weight of Marko and his father is 1.25 times the weight of just Marko's father, which is equal to 125% of the weight of just Marko's father.
Response:  Firstly, Marko and his father had 24 pounds of sugar. After eating 9 pounds of sugar, they were left with 15 pounds (24 - 9 = 15). Now, Marko has 3 pounds of sugar left (15 - 3 = 12). So, the correct answer is 12 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, Marko and his father had 36 pounds of strawberries. They sold 8 pounds of strawberries at $2 per pound, so they earned $16. Now, they have 28 pounds of strawberries left. If each pound of strawberry is worth $2, then they have $56 left ($2 x 28 pounds).
Response:  Firstly, Marko and his father together have 22 pounds of sugarcane stalks. If they sell each stalk for Tk. 30, then their total earning will be:  22 x 30 = 660 taka.  Next, if Marko sells 30 more stalks at the same price, he will earn:  30 x 30 = 900 taka. Therefore, Marko's total earnings from both sales will be:  660 + 900 = 1560 taka. Finally, if we subtract the cost price of the remaining 30 stalks (which is 30 x 30 = 900 taka), we get:  1560 - 900 = 660 taka. So, Marko's net profit from both sales is 660 taka.
Response:  We know that Marko and his father have a total of 37 pounds (37 x 2 = 74 pounds).  If their combined weight is 74 pounds, then each person weighs half of that amount, or 37/2 = 18.5 pounds.  So, Marko's father weighed 18.5 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko's weight is 30 pounds (30 x 2 = 60). Now, if we subtract the weight of their father and mother together from Marko's weight, we will get the remaining weight of Marko after deducting his parents' weight. So, we need to find out how much weight Marko's parents have combined. We are given that each parent has 17 pounds of weight, so they have a total weight of 17 + 17 = 34 pounds. Therefore, Marko's remaining weight after deducting his parents' weight would be: 60 - 34 = 26 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko's weight is 10 pounds less than his father's weight. So, if his father's weight is x pounds, then Marko's weight is (x - 10) pounds. Secondly, we know that the total weight of Marko and his father together is 26 pounds. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: (x - 10) + x = 26 Now solve for x to find out how much heavier Marko's father is compared to him. Solution: We add (x - 10) and x in the above equation: (x - 10) + x = 26 Adding like terms: 2x - 10 = 26 Subtracting 10 from both sides: 2x = 36 Divide both sides by 2: x = 18 Now we have found out that Marko's father is 18 pounds heavier than him.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko's father's weight is 11 pounds (11 পাউন্ড). If their combined weight is 30 pounds (30 পাউন্ড), then we can find out how much Marko weighs by subtracting his father's weight from the total weight. So, Marko weighs:  30 - 11 = 19 pounds (19 পাউন্ড).
Response:  Firstly, we know that two children were in the basement initially. Then, more children came to the basement, and there were altogether ten children including the initial two. So, if we subtract 2 from 10, we get 8 as the total number of additional children who joined later. Therefore, the current number of children in the basement is 8 + 2 = 10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 26 children in the base. Then, 38 more children came to the base. So, the total number of children in the base now is:  26 + 38 = 64 children. Therefore, there are currently 64 children in the base.
Response:  Firstly, 2 children were in the bus stop. Then, 41 more children came to the bus stop. So, if we add 2 and 41, we get:  2 + 41 = 43 Therefore, there were 43 children at the bus stop altogether.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 43 children were in the base. 21 children remained there after some of them went to the store. So, if x is the number of children who went to the store, then 43 - x is the number of children remaining in the base. Now, we are told that 21 children remained in the base. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  43 - x = 21 We can solve for x as follows:  43 - x = 21 Add 43 to both sides:  43 + 43 = 21 + 43 Subtract 43 from both sides:  86 = 21 + x Subtract 21 from both sides:  65 = x Therefore, x = 65 children went to the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 41 children were in the hostel initially. Then, 12 children left the hostel, leaving behind 41 - 12 = 29 children. Now, if 12 more children join the hostel, there will be 29 + 12 = 41 children in total. So, currently, there are 41 children in the hostel.
Response:  We know that 21 children were in the base and 10 children went to the store. So, there are 21 - 10 = 11 children left in the base. Now, we know that some more children went to the store from the base, but we don't know how many. Let's assume that x children went to the store from the base. So, the total number of children who went to the store is 10 + x. We also know that there are 16 children in the store now (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 10 + x = 16. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. So, there were 6 children who went to the store from the base. Now, let's find out how many children are left in the base. We know that 21 children were in the base initially, and 10 children went to the store, leaving 11 children behind. Therefore, there are 21 - 10 = 11 children left in the base.
Response:  Firstly, there were five children in the base group who did not get sick (5). Then, 63 children from the base group got sick (63), and some more children from the other groups also got sick (let's assume x children from each of the other groups got sick, where x is a variable we don't know yet). In total, then, 63 + x children from all groups got sick. Now, out of the remaining children in the base group, only 14 did not get sick (14). So, the total number of children who did not get sick is 5 + 14 = 19. Finally, if we add up all the children who got sick (63 + x) and those who did not get sick (19), we get a total of 82 children. Therefore, the answer is 82.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 children were in the base. Then, 68 children came from there and went to another place. So, if we subtract 68 from 36, we get: 36 - 68 =?  Yes, you are correct! The difference between 36 and 68 is 32. Therefore, 32 children remained in the base after 68 children left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 22 children in the base and 40 children in the new hostel. So, if some children from the base went to the new hostel, then the number of children left in the base would be less than 22. Now, let's assume that x children from the base went to the new hostel. Then, the total number of children in the base after some children went to the new hostel can be calculated as follows: Total number of children in the base = 22 - x We also know that the total number of children in both the base and the new hostel is equal to 62 (22 + 40). Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: 22 - x + 40 = 62 Solving for x, we get: x = 10 So, there were 10 children from the base who went to the new hostel. Therefore, the number of children left in the base is: Total number of children in the base = 22 - 10 = 12
Response:  Firstly, there were 28 children in the base.  28 x 8 = 224 (total number of children who went to the camp) Now, let's find out how many children returned from the camp. We know that 82 children did not return from the camp. So, we subtract 82 from 224: 224 - 82 = 142 (number of children who returned from the camp) Finally, we need to find out how many children are left in the base after the camp. To do this, we subtract the number of children who returned from the total number of children in the base: 28 - 142 = 13 (number of children left in the base after the camp) Therefore, there are 13 children left in the base after the camp.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 23 children in the base and 4 more children joined from outside. So, the total number of children in the base is:  23 + 4 = 27 Now, we are told that some children left the base, but we don't know how many. We do know that after they left, there were only 8 children remaining in the base. So, let's subtract the number of children who left from the original total to find out how many children left:  27 - x (where x is the number of children who left) Since we want to find out how many children left, we can set up an equation using ""x"" as our variable:  27 - x = 8 Solving for ""x"", we get:  27 - x = 8 8 = 27 - x x = 19 Therefore, 19 children left the base."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has sold 133 items in total. If she sells each item for Tk. 51, then her total sales revenue would be:  133 x 51 = 6983 Taka. Now, if she wants to calculate how many more items she needs to produce and sell to reach her target of Tk. 7000, she can subtract her current sales revenue from her target:  7000 - 6983 = 117 Taka. So, Becky needs to produce and sell 117 more items to reach her target of Tk. 7000.
Response: 13 - 54 = 41 (subtracting 54 from 13) So, Becky has sold 41 packets of cookies.
Response: 145 x 7 =? First, let's multiply 145 by 6: 145 x 6 = 870 Now, let's add 7 to 870: 870 + 7 = 877 So, Becky has made 877 cakes in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 155 chocolates and her friends have 140 chocolates. So, in total, they have 155 + 140 = 295 chocolates. Now, if we subtract the number of chocolates that Becky's friends have from the total number of chocolates, we get:  295 - 140 = 155. Therefore, Becky has 155 chocolates left after her friends take their share.
Response: 120 x 105 = 12600 (total cost of 120 units) 12600 - 1700 = 10900 (remaining cost after selling 170 units at Tk. 105 each) Now, let's calculate the number of new units that can be purchased with the remaining cost: 10900 / 105 = 104 (number of new units that can be purchased) So, there are 104 new units available for purchase with the remaining cost of Tk. 10900.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky sold 130 pieces of jewelry at $91 each and made a profit of $65 per piece. So, her total profit from selling those 130 pieces is:   Profit = Number of pieces x Price per piece - Cost price  Profit = 130 x $91 - Cost price  Profit = 12,330 - Cost price We don't know the cost price yet. But we can calculate it later. Now, let's move to the second part of the question. Becky bought 91 new pieces of jewelry at $154 each. So, the total amount she paid for those pieces is:   Total amount = Number of pieces x Price per piece  Total amount = 91 x $154  Total amount = $14,094 Now, we have two equations: Equation (1): Profit + Total amount = Total revenue Equation (2): Profit = Number of pieces x Price per piece - Cost price Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (1), we get: Profit + Total amount = Total revenue Profit + $14,094 = $12,330 + $91 x $91 - Cost price Profit + $14,094 = $12,330 + $8,279 - Cost price Solving for the value of ""Cost price"", we get: Cost price = $4,021 Therefore, Becky made a profit of $8,279 ($91 x 91) from selling the 130 pieces of jewelry, and she spent $4,021 as the cost price for buying the 91 new pieces of jewelry."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky sold 170 items at $8 each and made a profit of $31. So, her total revenue from selling those items is:  170 x $8 = $1,360 Profit = $31 Total Revenue = $1,391 Now, let's find out how many new items she bought if she spent $31 on buying them. We can use the equation: Cost per item = Total cost / Number of items So, we can write: Cost per item = $31 / (Number of items) To solve for the number of items, we can divide both sides by the cost per item: Number of items = Cost per item x Total cost / Profit So, we have: Number of items = ($31 / $8) x $1,391 / $31 Number of items = 17 x 45 = 765 items Therefore, Becky bought 765 new items.
Response: 110 x 75 = 8250 (first calculation) 8250 - 7600 = 650 (second calculation) So, Beckar has 650 cakes left after selling 7600 cakes.
Response: 144 x 7 = 1008 (first calculation) 1008 - 111 = 997 (subtracting 111 from 1008) So, Becky made 997 cookies in total.
Response: 1490 - 91 = 1399 (subtracting 91 from 1490) Now we have to find out how many cakes are left after selling 100 packets of pastries. We know that each packet contains 9 pieces of pastries. So, if Becky sells 100 packets of pastries, she will sell 9 x 100 = 900 pieces of pastries. Therefore, the number of cakes left with Becky is 1399 - 900 = 499.
Response: 1500 - 148 = 1352. So, there will be 1352 pieces of pasta left after Becky eats 1500 and her brother eats 148.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 126 pieces of cake and 48 pieces of pastry to sell. If she sells 115 pieces of cake and 81 pieces of pastry, then how many more pieces of cake does she have after selling them? To find out, we need to subtract the number of items sold from the total amount available with her. So, let's do it:  126 - 115 =?  We get:  126 - 115 = 11 Now, we need to find out how many more pieces of pastry she has after selling them. So, let's do it again:   48 - 81 =?  We get:   48 - 81 = -33 Therefore, Becky has 11 more pieces of cake and 33 fewer pieces of pastry after selling them.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 190 chickens and 131 turkeys. If she sells 70 chickens and 88 turkeys, then she will have fewer chickens and turkeys left. To find out how many more chickens she has than turkeys, we need to subtract the number of turkeys she sold from the number of turkeys she had initially. So, if she sold 88 turkeys, then she has 131 - 88 = 43 turkeys left. Now, let's find out how many more chickens she has than turkeys. We can do this by subtracting the number of turkeys she has from the number of chickens she has. So, if she has 43 turkeys and 190 chickens, then she has 190 - 43 = 147 chickens more than turkeys. Therefore, the answer is 147.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has sold 157 chickens and 169 turkeys in total. We also know that she has sold each chicken for Tk. 158 and each turkey for Tk. 147. So, let's calculate how much money she has made from selling chickens and turkeys separately.  Calculation of income from chicken sales: Total number of chickens sold = 157 Number of chickens x Price per chicken = 157 x Tk. 158 = Tk. 24,396 Income from chicken sales = Tk. 24,396 Calculation of income from turkey sales: Total number of turkeys sold = 169 Number of turkeys x Price per turkey = 169 x Tk. 147 = Tk. 24,933 Income from turkey sales = Tk. 24,933 Now, let's find out how much profit Becky has made overall. Profit = Total income - Total cost Cost = (Total number of chickens x Price per chicken) + (Total number of turkeys x Price per turkey) = (157 x Tk. 158) + (169 x Tk. 147) = Tk. 24,396 + Tk. 24,933 = Tk. 49,329 Therefore, Becky has made a profit of Tk. 49,329 from selling both chickens and turkeys.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has sold 54 chickens and 143 ducks. If she sells 68 chickens and 92 ducks, then the total number of birds she will have sold is:  54 + 68 = 122  Now, let's find out how many more ducks she has sold than chickens. We can do this by subtracting the number of chickens from the total number of ducks:  143 - 54 = 89 So, Becky has sold 89 more ducks than chickens.
Response: 1) If Becky has 44 chocolates and she gives 48 to her friend as a gift, then how many chocolates will be left with Becky?  2) If there are x chocolates left with Becky, then we know that x + 48 = 44 (since Becky had 44 chocolates initially). Now solve for x using basic arithmetic.
Response: 1) If Becky sells 40 pieces of cake at $8 each, her total revenue will be: 40 x $8 = $320 2) If she has 80 pieces of cake left, and she wants to sell them all at $8 each, her total revenue from those 80 pieces will be: 80 x $8 = $640 3) So, her total revenue for both sets of cakes will be: $320 + $640 = $960.
Response: 137 x 169 =? First, let's multiply 137 and 100: 137 x 100 = 13700 Now, let's add 69 to 13700: 13700 + 69 =? The result is: 13769 So, if Becky has 137 friends and each friend gives her 69 chocolates, then she will have in total: 137 x 69 = 9543 chocolates.
Response: 173 - 103 = 70. So, Becky has 70 new checks and 86 old checks left with her.
Response: 167 new cakes were baked and 89 cakes were sold. So, to find out how many cakes are left with Becka, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of new cakes baked.  Total new cakes = 167 Subtracting the number of cakes sold (89) from the total new cakes gives us: 167 - 89 =?  Therefore, Becka has 78 leftover cakes.
Response: 139 new cakes were baked and 145 cakes were sold. So, the total number of cakes that Becka has baked and sold is: 139 + 145 = 284 cakes.
Response: 149 - 62 = 87 (difference between the number of packets sold and the original quantity) 87 / 144 = 0.6 (ratio of remaining packets to original quantity) 0.6 x 144 = 86.4 (estimated number of packets left with the seller) So, there are approximately 86 packets left with the seller after the buyer purchased 62 packets.
Response: 1) Becar sold 810 pieces of goods at Tk 92 each. So, the total amount earned from this sale is: 810 x 92 = 74520 2) After that, he bought 92 pieces of goods at Tk 46 each. So, the total amount spent on buying those goods is: 92 x 46 = 4352 3) Now, let's find out how much profit Becar made from selling and buying goods. Profit = Total Amount Earned - Total Amount Spent On Buying Goods Profit = 74520 - 4352 = 70168 Therefore, Becar made a profit of Tk 70168 from selling and buying goods.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 61 units of pasta and 167 units of chicken. If she sells 108 units of chicken and 44 units of pasta, then she will have how many units of each left?  To find out, let's subtract the number of items sold from her total stock:   Pasta: 61 - 44 = 17 units of pasta left Chicken: 167 - 108 = 59 units of chicken left So, Becky will have 17 units of pasta and 59 units of chicken left after selling those items.
Response: 104 - 29 = 75. So, Becky has 75 pastries left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 54 chickens and 84 ducks. If she sells 102 chickens and 94 ducks, then she will have how many chickens and ducks left? To find out, let's subtract the number of animals sold from the total number of animals she had:  54 - 102 =? (chickens)  84 - 94 =? (ducks) Now solve for each equation separately to get the answers:  54 - 102 = 48 (chickens)  84 - 94 = 6 (ducks) So, after selling 102 chickens and 94 ducks, Becky will have 48 chickens and 6 ducks left.
Response: 134 x 11 = 1474 (total cost of 11 packets). Now, if he sells each packet for Tk. 92, then his total revenue will be: 1474 x 92 = 135088. So, he has made a profit of:  135088 - 1474 = 126644. Therefore, Becky has made a profit of Tk. 126644 from selling 11 packets of chocolate at Tk. 92 per packet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 14 chickens and 153 ducks. If she sells 8 chickens and 97 ducks, then she will have how many fewer chickens and ducks left? To find out, let's subtract the number of animals sold from the total number of each type of animal. For chickens: 14 - 8 = 6 (she will have 6 chickens left) For ducks: 153 - 97 = 56 (she will have 56 ducks left) So, in total, Becky will have 6 chickens and 56 ducks left after selling 8 chickens and 97 ducks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Becky has 43 pieces of jewelry and 114 pieces of clothes. If she sells each piece of jewelry for $78 and each piece of clothing for $56, then her total revenue from selling both types of items will be: Revenue from Jewelry = 43 x $78 = $3,304 Revenue from Clothes = 114 x $56 = $6,224 Total Revenue = $3,304 + $6,224 = $9,528 Now, let's calculate how much profit she makes after deducting the cost price of each item from its selling price. Profit from Jewelry = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit from Clothes = Selling Price - Cost Price To find out the cost price of each item, we need to know how many pieces of each type of item she has. So, let's divide the number of pieces into two categories: Jewelry (43) and Clothes (114). For Jewelry: Cost Price per Piece = Total Cost / Number of Pieces Cost Price per Piece = ($3,304 / 43) = $76.74 For Clothes: Cost Price per Piece = Total Cost / Number of Pieces Cost Price per Piece = ($6,224 / 114) = $54.17 Now, let's calculate the profit for each category: Profit from Jewelry = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit from Jewelry = $78 x 43 - $76.74 x 43 = $3,304 - $3,295.42 = $108.58 Profit from Clothes = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit from Clothes = $56 x 114 - $54.17 x 114 = $6,224 - $6,065.38 = $158.62 Therefore, Becky makes a total profit of $108.58 + $158.62 = $267.20
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two games in total. So, if each game has 140 questions, then together they will have 280 questions (2 x 140). Now, if 140 questions are left out of the total 280, then the remaining number of questions would be:  280 - 140 = 140. Therefore, 140 questions will be left out of the total 280.
Response:  If Keli has 106 games and gives 64 games to his friends, then he will have how many games left with him?   Solution: We know that Keli has 106 games initially. If he gives 64 games to his friends, then the number of games left with him can be calculated as follows: 106 - 64 =?  The answer is 42. So, Keli will have 42 games left with him after giving 64 games to his friends.
Response: 91 - 92 = 1. So, there is only one game left after playing 91 games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 games in total and 70 snacks. So, if we divide 70 by 20, we get: 70 / 20 = 3 5 Therefore, there will be 35 snacks left after playing all the games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 46 games in total (46 x 13 = 594). Now, if we subtract the number of games played so far (31), we get:  594 - 31 = 563. Therefore, there are 563 games left to be played.
Response: 1) Kelir has 80 games in his collection. 2) He has played 31 games so far. 3) To find out how many games he will have left after playing 6 more games, we need to subtract 31 from 80. Therefore, the number of games Kelir will have left after playing 6 more games is:  80 - 31 = 49 games.
"Response: 
1. Randir has 52 blocks in total. 
2. He used 38 blocks to build a tower. 
3. So he has 52 - 38 = 14 blocks left. 
Therefore, Randir had 14 blocks before building the tower."
Response: 1) Randir has 97 blocks in total. 2) He uses 3 blocks for each tower he builds (given). So, if he wants to build 7 towers, how many blocks will be left over? Solution: First, let's calculate how many blocks Randir needs for each tower: 3 x 7 = 21 blocks per tower. Now, let's subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks: 97 - 21(7) = 97 - 147 = -50 blocks. Therefore, there will be 50 blocks left over if Randir builds 7 towers using 3 blocks per tower.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randir has 79 blocks in total. He used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, how many blocks are left with him? To find out, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used from his total number of blocks. Total blocks = 79 blocks Used blocks (for tower) = 14 blocks Used blocks (for house) = 11 blocks Subtracting the used blocks from the total blocks, we get: Total blocks - Used blocks (for tower) - Used blocks (for house) = 79 blocks - 14 blocks - 11 blocks Left over blocks = 54 blocks Therefore, Randir has 54 blocks left with him after building both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randir has 58 blocks in total and he uses 27 of them to build a tower. So, he has 31 blocks left (58 - 27 = 31). Now, he uses 31 blocks to build another tower. Therefore, the total number of blocks used by Randir is 27 + 31 = 58.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has 37 blocks in total and he uses 33 of them to build a tower. So, how many blocks does Randy have left after building the tower? To find out, we can subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks:  37 - 33 = 4  Therefore, Randy has 4 blocks left after building the tower. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We are asked to determine how much more block Randy needs to build another house. To do this, we need to calculate the difference between the number of blocks required to build another house (13) and the number of blocks Randy has left (4):  13 - 4 = 9  So, Randy needs 9 more blocks to build another house.
Response: 1) Randir has 86 blocks in total. 2) He uses 79 blocks to build a tower. 3) So he has 86 - 79 = 7 blocks left. 4) He uses 7 blocks to build a house. Therefore, Randir has used all his blocks (86) and has nothing left.
Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks and uses 59 of them to build a tower, then he has used all his blocks. So, there are no blocks left. Therefore, the answer is zero (0).
Response:  Firstly, he has to use 20 blocks of wood for building one house and 50 blocks for building one table. So, in total, he needs 70 blocks of wood (20 + 50) to build both the house and the table.
Response: 1) Randir has 90 blocks in total. 2) He uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. 3) To build a house, he needs 89 blocks. 4) To build a tower, he needs 63 blocks. Now we need to find out how many extra blocks Randir has after building both the house and the tower. We can do this by subtracting the number of blocks used for each structure from the total number of blocks available. So, let's subtract: Total blocks - Blocks used for house = Extra blocks House blocks = 90 - 89 = 1 Tower blocks = 90 - 63 = 27 Therefore, Randir has 1 block left over after building both structures.
Response:  If you have read 5 books so far and there are 20 books in total, then you have read 5/20 = 1/4 of the total number of books. So, you have read one-fourth of the series.
Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the series and we have read 8 of them. So, the number of books left to be read is:  13 - 8 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more books in the series that we need to read.
Response:  If you read 12 books and watch 56 movies, then:  Books: 12 x 10 = 120 pages (assuming an average book has 100 pages) Movies: 56 x 2 hours = 112 hours (assuming an average movie lasts for 2 hours) So, in total, you will spend 120 + 112 = 232 hours reading and watching.
Response:  If you read 19 books and watch 7 movies, then you will have spent 19 x 2 = 38 hours reading books and 7 x 2 = 14 hours watching movies. In total, you will have spent 38 + 14 = 52 hours consuming media.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books in total in the ""Creepy Silly School"" series.  Of those, we also know that 13 are chillers and 3 are horror stories. So, if we divide 16 by 2 (since there are two types of books), we get:  16 / 2 = 8 Now, let's subtract the number of chillers from both sides to find out how many horror stories there are:  8 - 13 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 horror stories in the ""Creepy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the ""Creepy Silly School"" series and 10 chillers in total. If we read 19 books and watch 61 videos, how many more chillers can be found in the series? To find out, we need to subtract the number of books we have already read from the total number of chillers. So, if we have read 19 books, we can calculate as follows: Total number of chillers - Number of books = 61 - 19 = 42 Therefore, there are 42 more chillers in the ""Creepy Silly School"" series that we have not yet encountered."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in total. If we divide the number of books by the number of movies, we get: 10/11 = 0.9 (rounded to two decimal places) So, for every one movie, there are approximately 0.9 books. In other words, if you read all the movies, you would need to read about 90% of the books to cover both mediums equally.
Response:  We know that there are 11 books in the series and 17 movies. If we read 7 books and watch 21 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies we have watched compared to the number of books we have read. To do this, we need to subtract the number of books we have read from the total number of movies we have watched. So, if we read 7 books and watch 21 movies, we can calculate as follows:  21 - 7 =?  The difference between 21 and 7 is 14. Therefore, we have watched 14 more movies than we have read books.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the ""Pagal Mukher School"" series and a total of 14 books in all. To find out how many more books will be read, we need to subtract the number of books already read (8) from the total number of books (14). So, the difference is:  14 - 8 = 6  Therefore, there are 6 more books left to be read in the entire series."
Response:  If you read 4 books and watch 34 videos, then: Books: 4 x 10 = 40 pages Videos: 34 x 60 = 2040 minutes So, in total, you will spend 40 + 2040 = 2080 minutes or approximately 34 hours and 40 minutes reading books and watching videos.
Response:  We know that there are 7 books and 4 movies in total. If we divide the number of books by the number of movies, we get: 7/4 = 1 and 3/4. So, if you read 7 books and watch 4 movies, you will have seen 1 and 3/4 movies.
Response:  We know that there are 14 books in the series and 15 films based on those books. So, if we divide 15 by 14, we get: 15/14 = 1 With one book left over. Therefore, there is one extra film based on the additional book.
Response:  We know that there are 16 books in total in the series.  Of those, we have read 13 books and watched 63 movies. So, if we divide 16 by 2 (books and movies), we get:  16/2 = 8 Now, let's subtract the number of books we have read from both sides of the equation to find out how many more books are left to be read:  8 - 13 = 5 So, there are 5 more books left to be read in the series!
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in total. If we divide the number of books by the number of movies, we get: 10/6 = 1.67 So, for every one movie, there are approximately 1.67 books. Therefore, if you have read 14 movies, you have roughly read 1.67 x 14 = 25 books.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series and 5 films based on those books. So, if we read 16 books (all the books in the series), we would have watched 5 films (based on the number of films made). Therefore, the ratio of books to films is 8:5 or 16:5. To find out how many books you have read, divide the number of films you have seen by the ratio. In this case, if you have seen 19 films, divide 19 by 5 to get 380/5 = 76. This means you have read 76 books in the series.
"Response: 
1. Dev has 7 tickets. 2. He used 3 tickets for the cricket match. 3. So he has 7 - 3 = 4 tickets left.  Therefore, Dev has 4 tickets left to use for other purposes."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Dev has 12 tickets and he sold 5 of them. So, the number of tickets left with him is:  
12 - 5 = 7 
Now, if he had 14 tickets, how many more tickets did he have before selling 5 of them? To find out, subtract the number of tickets he had after selling from the total number of tickets he had:  
14 - 7 = 7 
So, Dev had 7 more tickets before selling 5 of them."
Response:  If Dev has 18 tickets and uses 5 of them to play games, then he will have 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left.  If he uses 11 more tickets to play games, then he will have 13 - 11 = 2 tickets left.   Therefore, Dev will have 2 tickets left after using all his tickets to play games.
Response:  If Dev has 19 tickets and uses 12 of them to play games, he will have 7 tickets left.  If he plays 7 more games with these remaining tickets, he will have no tickets left. So, in total, Dev has played 12 + 7 = 19 games.
Response: 13 tickets were sold in total. If he used 8 tickets for the lottery and won nothing, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5). Now, if he uses all 5 tickets to buy the lottery again, there is a possibility that he might win something this time around. So, the number of possible outcomes for him winning something with all 5 tickets is 10 (since there are only 10 possible outcomes when buying 5 tickets). However, if he doesn't win anything with all 5 tickets, then he will be left with no tickets (5 - 5 = 0), which means he can't participate in the next round of the lottery. Therefore, the maximum number of possible outcomes for him winning something with all 5 tickets is 9 (since there are only 9 possible outcomes when buying 5 tickets and winning something).
Response: 14 - 2 = 12. So, Dev has 12 tickets left for the remaining 10 games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 14 trees in total before the storm hit. After the storm, 9 trees got damaged and fell down. So, the number of trees left standing after the storm is:  14 - 9 = 5 trees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 13 trees in total before the storm hit. After the storm, six trees fell down. So, how many trees are left standing now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of fallen trees (6) from the original number of trees (13). Therefore, the answer is:  13 - 6 = 7  There are 7 trees left standing after the storm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 20 trees in Helali's backyard. After the storm, four trees remained standing. So, if we subtract the number of trees remaining after the storm (4) from the initial number of trees (20), we get:  20 - 4 = 16  Therefore, 16 trees were uprooted or damaged during the storm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 trees in total and 5 of them have been cut down. So, the number of trees left is 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Helena has planted 7 trees.
Response: 1) Firstly, Heili had 9 goats and she gave 4 to Tufan. So, she has 9 - 4 = 5 goats left with her. 2) Next, Tufan took away 5 more goats from Heili, leaving her with 5 - 5 = 0 goats. Therefore, there are 5 goats left with Tufan.
Response: 12 - 4 = 8 (subtracting 4 from 12). So, there are 8 trees left.
Response:  We know that there are 13 trees in total and three of them have fallen down due to the storm. So, we can say that 10 trees (13 - 3 = 10) are still standing.
Response:  If there are 11 trees in total and two have been cut down, then we can calculate how many more trees need to be cut down to reach 10 trees left.  11 - 2 = 9 So, 9 trees need to be cut down to reach 10 trees left.
Response: 1) First, we need to calculate how many liters of milk they consume daily based on the information given in the problem statement. We know that they consume 66 liters per day and there are 20 liters in each sack. So, we can calculate as follows: Daily Milk Consumption = Total Number of Sacks x Volume of Each Sack Daily Milk Consumption = 20 x 66 = 1320 liters Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. If they have 28 sacks, how much milk will they get in total? Total Milk = Number of Sacks x Volume of Each Sack Total Milk = 28 x 1320 = 3640 liters Therefore, if they have 28 sacks of milk, they will have a total of 3640 liters of milk.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu takes 8 seconds to complete one cycle of work and rest. So, if he works for 24 seconds, he will take 8 seconds of rest after every 24 seconds. Therefore, the number of cycles of work and rest Tinu can do in 24 seconds is:  24 sec / 8 sec per cycle = 3 cycles
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 days in total for which the amount of sugarcane to be purchased is 56 quintals. So, the daily requirement of sugarcane can be calculated as follows: Total quantity of sugarcane = Daily quantity x Number of days 56 quintals = x quintals x 4 days Therefore, the daily quantity of sugarcane required is: x quintals = 56 quintals / 4 days = 14 quintals per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has been consuming 38 sacks of rice for 49 days. So, in total, he has consumed:  38 x 49 = 1872 sacks of rice Now, if he continues to consume at the same rate, he will have consumed an additional:  1872 x (1/30) = 62.4 sacks of rice per day Therefore, after 100 days, Tinu will have consumed a total of:  62.4 x 100 = 6240 sacks of rice
Response:  Firstly, we know that they have 66 sacks of rice and each sack contains 25 kg of rice. So, in total, they have 66 x 25 = 1650 kg of rice. Now, if they sell each kilogram of rice at Tk 40, then their total earning from selling all the rice will be 1650 x 40 = 66000 tk. But, as per the information given in the question, after 87 days, only 25% of the rice is left unsold, which means that 1650 x 25 = 41250 kg of rice is still unsold. So, the amount of money they will get for the unsold rice is 41250 x 40 = 165000 tk. Therefore, the total amount of money they will receive for both sold and unsold rice is 66000 + 165000 = 231000 tk.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu takes 8 sacs of rice to his workplace every day and sells each sac for Tk.35. So, he earns Tk.280 per day (8 x Tk.35). Now, let's calculate how much rice he sells in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so Tinu sells 7 x 8 = 56 sacs of rice per week. Finally, let's calculate how much rice he sells in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so Tinu sells 4 x 56 = 224 sacs of rice per month.
Response: 16 x 57 = 922 (number of days). So, if he works for 80 days, he will earn: 922 - 80 = 842 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 67 sacks of wheat and each sack contains 12 kg of wheat. So, the total weight of wheat is: Total weight = Number of sacks x Weight per sack Total weight = 67 x 12 = 804 kg Now, if Tinu wants to sell 35 sacks of wheat, he will have to sell: Partial amount sold = Number of sacks to be sold x Weight per sack Partial amount sold = 35 x 12 = 420 kg Therefore, the remaining amount of wheat with Tinu after selling 35 sacks will be: Remaining amount = Total weight - Partial amount sold Remaining amount = 804 - 420 = 384 kg
Response: 1st step: We know that they have 74 sacks of rice and they sell each sack at Tk. 6100. So, their total earning from selling all the sacks will be: Total Earning = Number of Sacks x Price per Sack Total Earning = 74 x 6100 = 452,800 They have to pay back Tk. 71,000 as loan, so their net profit will be: Net Profit = Total Earning - Loan Amount Net Profit = 452,800 - 71,000 = 381,800 Now, let's calculate how many sacks of rice they can buy with their net profit. To do this, we need to divide their net profit by the price per sack: Number of Sacks = Net Profit ÷ Price per Sack Number of Sacks = 381,800 ÷ 6100 = 62 Therefore, after selling all their rice, they will have 62 sacks left, which is equal to 62 x 6100 = 379,200 rupees.
Response: 1) Firstly, we know that he spends 76000 taka per month and has 64000 taka in his account. So, if he wants to spend 50000 taka, he will have to withdraw 16000 taka from his account.  2) Now, let's calculate how many days of expenses this amount can cover. We know that he spends 76000 taka per month, so 16000 taka is equal to (76000/30) = 253.33 days of expenses. Therefore, 16000 taka can cover 253.33 days of his monthly expenses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 28 packets of rice and 52 packets of wheat flour. Now, if he distributes these among his family members equally, then each member will get: 28/4 = 7 packets of rice and 52/4 = 13 packets of wheat flour. So, after 26 days, Tinu will have 7 x 26 = 182 packets of rice and 13 x 26 = 338 packets of wheat flour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has been consuming 82 grams of rice and 61 grams of lentils daily for the past 25 days. Now, if he continues to consume the same amount of food daily, then after 40 days, his total consumption of rice will be: Total rice consumed = Daily rice consumption x Number of days consumed Total rice consumed = 82 g x 40 d = 3280 grams Similarly, his total consumption of lentils will be: Total lentil consumption = Daily lentil consumption x Number of days consumed Total lentil consumption = 61 g x 40 d = 2440 grams So, after 40 days, Tinu will have consumed a total of 3280 + 2440 = 5720 grams of rice and lentils combined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tinu has 31 packs of rice and 24 packs of wheat flour. Now, if he sells 10 packets of rice and 5 packets of wheat flour every day, then how many packets of each will he have left after 45 days?   To find out how many packets of rice Tinu will have left, we need to subtract 10 from 31: 31 - 10 = 21 So, Tinu will have 21 packets of rice left after 45 days. Similarly, to find out how many packets of wheat flour Tinu will have left, we need to subtract 5 from 24: 24 - 5 = 19 So, Tinu will have 19 packets of wheat flour left after 45 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 44 packed and 25 unpacked bags of rice in total. Now, we need to find out how many more unpacked bags than packed bags were taken. We can do this by subtracting the number of packed bags from the total number of bags. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  44 - 25 = 19  Therefore, 19 more unpacked bags than packed bags were taken.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 packets of rice and 74 packets of wheat flour in total. Now, if 30 packets of rice and 21 packets of wheat flour are taken out daily, then how many packets of each item will be left after one week? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of items taken out daily from the total amount available. So, for rice, we have: Total rice = 5 packets x 7 days = 35 packets Subtracting 30 packets (daily consumption) gives us: Left rice = 35 - 30 = 5 packets Similarly, for wheat flour, we have: Total wheat flour = 74 packets x 7 days = 508 packets Subtracting 21 packets (daily consumption) gives us: Left wheat flour = 508 - 21 = 487 packets Therefore, after one week, there will be 5 packets of rice and 487 packets of wheat flour left.
Response: 12 x 54 = 648. So, if they eat 12 meals per day and each meal costs Tk 54, their daily expenditure will be Tk 648.
Response: 14 days x 56 sacks =? To find out how many sacks of rice Tinu has to carry every day, we need to divide 14 days by 56 sacks. 14 days / 56 sacks =? We can simplify this division by dividing both numbers by their common factor of 2. 14 days / 28 (since there are 28 sacks per week) =? Now we have our daily amount of sacks:? sacks per day. So, Tinu has to carry 30 sacks of rice every day for 14 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they have 25 apri-preparatory questions and 5 final preparatory questions in total. So, if they spend 78 days studying, they will study for approximately:  25 x 14 = 350 days (for the apri-preparatory questions) + 5 x 14 = 70 days (for the final preparatory questions) = 350 + 70 = 420 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they have 65 apri-pakva komola (46 x 1.5 = 69) and 46 pari-pakva komola (46 x 1.5 = 69). So, in total, they have 69 + 69 = 138 komola. Now, if they sell each komola for Tk. 20, then their total earning from selling all the komola will be 138 x 20 = Tk. 2760. But, as per the information given in the question, they sold only 6 days worth of komola, so their actual earning will be 6/7 x 2760 = Tk. 2400.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 apri-pakva (pre-monsoon) days and 86 pari-pakva (post-monsoon) days in total. So, if Tinu knows that during these 41 days, he caught 30 fish per day on average, then he must have caught a total of:  30 x 41 = 1230 fish During the remaining 86 days, if he caught an average of 25 fish per day, then he must have caught a total of:  25 x 86 = 2150 fish Therefore, the total number of fish Tinu caught is: 1230 + 2150 = 3380 fish
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 71 apri-pakva (pre-monsoon) showers and 60 post-monsoon showers in total. Now, let's calculate how many of these showers were heavy. We are told that 30% of the pre-monsoon showers and 40% of the post-monsoon showers were heavy. So, if we calculate the number of heavy showers for each season separately, we get: Pre-monsoon season: 71 x 30/100 = 21 heavy showers Post-monsoon season: 60 x 40/100 = 24 heavy showers Therefore, there were 21 + 24 = 45 heavy showers in total.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times 12 is greater than 11. We can do this by subtracting 11 from 12 and seeing how many times that number is greater than 11.  12 - 11 = 1 So, 12 is greater than 11 by 1 time. Therefore, the difference between 12 and 11 is 1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 7 fruits in her basket. Now, if she gives 14 fruits to someone as a gift, how many fruits will be left in her basket? To find out, we need to subtract the number of fruits given away from the total number of fruits Jessie had initially. So, the calculation is:  7 - 14 =? Solution:  We subtract 14 from 7 and get:  7 - 14 = -7  Therefore, there will be 7 fewer fruits in Jessie's basket after giving away 14 fruits.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 7 fruits in her basket. Now, if she gives 14 fruits to someone as a gift, how many fruits will be left in her basket? To find out, we need to subtract the number of fruits given away from the total number of fruits Jessie had initially. So, the calculation is:  7 - 14 =? Solution: We subtract 14 from 7 and get: 7 - 14 = -7 Therefore, there will be 7 - 14 = -7 fruits left in Jessie's basket after giving away 14 fruits as a gift.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 11 feet of carpet and she wants to use it to cover her living room floor which is 15 feet long. So, she needs 4 more feet of carpet to complete the job. Now, if she has 16 more feet of carpet, she will have enough to cover the entire floor plus some extra for any mistakes or irregularities in measurement. Therefore, the number of feet of carpet Jessie needs is:  16 - 4 = 12 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the materials needed for constructing one unit of the building (including cement, sand, aggregate, and steel). We know that the cost of cement is Tk. 350 per bag, sand costs Tk. 150 per cubic meter, aggregate costs Tk. 800 per cubic meter, and steel costs Tk. 600 per metric ton. Now, let's calculate the quantity of each material required for one unit of the building: Quantity of Cement = Total Building Area / 1000 x 1 Bag/1000 ft^2 = 2000 ft^2 / 1000 x 1 Bag/1000 ft^2 = 2 Bags Cement Quantity of Sand = Total Building Area / 1000 x 1 Cubic Meter/1000 ft^3 = 2000 ft^3 / 1000 x 1 Cubic Meter/1000 ft^3 = 2 Cubic Meters Sand Quantity of Aggregate = Total Building Area / 1000 x 1 Cubic Meter/1000 ft^3 = 2000 ft^3 / 1000 x 1 Cubic Meter/1000 ft^3 = 2 Cubic Meters Aggregate Quantity of Steel = Total Building Area / 1000 x 1 Ton/1000 ft^2 = 2000 ft^2 / 1000 x 1 Ton/1000 ft^2 = 2 Metric Tons Steel Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the materials required for one unit of the building: Total Cost of Materials = Cost of Cement x Quantity of Cement + Cost of Sand x Quantity of Sand + Cost of Aggregate x Quantity of Aggregate + Cost of Steel x Quantity of Steel = (Tk. 350 x 2) + (Tk. 150 x 2) + (Tk. 800 x 2) + (Tk. 600 x 2) = Tk. 
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of all the floors (including the ground floor) of the building. We know that each floor has an area of 19 feet x 18 feet = 344 square feet. So, the total area of all the floors is: Total Area = Number of Floors x Area per Floor Total Area = 20 x 344 = 6880 square feet Now, we need to calculate the carpet area of the entire building. Carpet area is calculated by subtracting the thickness of the walls from the total area. In this case, if the wall thickness is assumed to be 2 feet, then the carpet area can be calculated as follows: Carpet Area = Total Area - Wall Thickness x Height Carpet Area = 6880 - (2 x 18) = 6880 - 36 = 6544 square feet Therefore, the carpet area of the entire building would be approximately 6544 square feet.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of days Jessica will be in Costa Rica. We know that she will be there for 19 days and then return home for 20 days. So, the total number of days = 19 + 20 = 39 days. Now, let's calculate the amount of time Jessica will spend in Costa Rica. We know that she will spend 19 days there, so the amount of time = 19 days x 24 hours/day = 432 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has 10 burlap sacks to fill with wheat.  Secondly, each sack can hold 5 feet of wheat. So, if Jessie wants to fill all her sacks, she needs to measure out 5 x 10 = 50 feet of wheat.   Therefore, the amount of wheat needed is 50 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of the carpet that Jessi needs for her living room. We know that she wants a carpet with an area of 10 square feet (10 x 10 = 100 square inches). Now, let's convert this into square meters. There are 36 inches in one meter, so: 100 square inches / 36 inches/meter = 2.78 square meters. Therefore, Jessi needs a carpet with an area of approximately 2.78 square meters. Next, we need to determine how many rolls of carpet Jessi will require based on the width of the carpet and its length. If each roll has a width of 2 feet (24 inches), then the length of each roll would be: 2.78 square meters / 24 inches per foot = 11.5 feet long. Since Jessi needs two rolls, she will require 2 x 11.5 feet = 23 feet of carpet. So, the total length of carpet Jessi requires is approximately 23 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of the carpet that Jessie needs. We know that she has 18 burgers and each burger is 4 feet long. So, the total length of all the burgers together would be:  18 x 4 = 72 feet Now, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet Jessie needs. To do this, we divide the total length by the width of the carpet (which is given as 20 inches or 1.67 feet). So, we have:  72 / 1.67 = 43.5 square feet Therefore, Jessie needs approximately 43.5 square feet of carpet for her party.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Reza Rabbyak has sold 23 shirts at Tk. 230 each. So, the total amount of money he has earned from selling those shirts is:  23 x 230 = 5190 tk.  Now, if he has sold 230 shirts in all, then the number of shirts he has left unsold is:  230 - 23 = 207 shirts.
Response:  We know that there are three types of shirts and each type has sold 20 pieces at $51 per piece. So, we can calculate the total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Shirts x Price Per Piece Total Revenue = 3 x 20 x $51 Total Revenue = 600 x $51 Total Revenue = $30,600 Now, let's find out the profit margin. Profit Margin = (Total Revenue - Cost Price) / Total Revenue Profit Margin = ($30,600 - Cost Price) / $30,600 Profit Margin = ($30,600 - Cost Price) / $30,600 Since we don't have information about the cost price, we cannot determine the profit margin. However, based on the given data, we can see that the total revenue is $30,600, which means the business made a profit of $30,600.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all 95 tickets purchased by Arkansas Game and Texts Game. We know that each ticket costs $87. So, the total cost can be calculated as follows: Total Cost = Number of Tickets x Price per Ticket Total Cost = 95 x $87 Total Cost = $8,295 Next, we need to calculate the profit made by Arkansas Game and Texts Game from selling these 95 tickets. To do this, we subtract the cost price from the selling price. In this case, the selling price is $100 per ticket. Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit = $100 - $87 Profit = $13 Per ticket Therefore, the total profit made by Arkansas Game and Texts Game from selling 95 tickets is: Total Profit = Number of Tickets x Profit per Ticket Total Profit = 95 x $13 Total Profit = $1,245 Finally, we need to find out how much money Arkansas Game and Texts Game would have made if they had sold only 47 tickets (i.e., the number of tickets they could have sold at $87 instead of $100). To do this, we use the same formula for calculating profit: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit = $100 - $87 Profit = $13 Per ticket Therefore, the total profit made by Arkansas Game and Texts Game from selling 47 tickets is: Total Profit = Number of Tickets x Profit per Ticket Total Profit = 47 x $13 Total Profit = $611 Now, let's add up both amounts to get the final answer: Final Answer = Total Profit from 95 tickets + Total Profit from 47 tickets Final Answer = $1,245 + $611 Final Answer = $1,856
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of t-shirts sold is 106 x 2 = 212. Now, let's find out how many t-shirts were sold in each game. In the Arkansas game, there were 242 t-shirts sold, and in the Texas Tech game, there were 115 t-shirts sold. So, to find out how many t-shirts were sold in the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold in the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:  212 - 242 = 30. Therefore, 30 t-shirts were sold in the Texas Tech game.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of t-shirts sold in both games combined. We know that in the Arkansas game, they sold 89 t-shirts and in the Texas game, they sold 166 t-shirts. So, the total number of t-shirts sold is:  89 + 166 = 255 t-shirts. Next, we need to find out how much money they made from selling these t-shirts. We know that each t-shirt costs $98. So, the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts is:  255 x $98 = $24,730.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all 186 items sold in both games combined. We know that each item costs $78 and there are 186 items in total. So, the total cost would be: Total Cost = Number of Items x Price per Item Total Cost = 186 x $78 Total Cost = $14,328 Now, let's subtract the amount earned from the Arkansas game (172 items x $78 per item = $13,056) from the total cost to find out how much they earned from the Texas game: Earnings from Texas Game = Total Cost - Amount Earned from Arkansas Game Earnings from Texas Game = $14,328 - $13,056 Earnings from Texas Game = $1,272 Therefore, the Texans earned $1,272 from the Texas game.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all 183 t-shirts and 31 jeans purchased from RezaraVyak and Teckas. We know that the price per unit of t-shirt is Tk. 62 and the price per unit of jean is Tk. 99. So, the total cost of all t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Cost of T-Shirts = Number of T-Shirts x Price Per Unit of T-Shirt Total Cost of T-Shirts = 183 x 62 = 11,466 Now, let's calculate the total cost of all jeans: Total Cost of Jeans = Number of Jeans x Price Per Unit of Jean Total Cost of Jeans = 31 x 99 = 3,099 Finally, we add the total costs of both t-shirts and jeans to get the grand total: Grand Total = Total Cost of T-Shirts + Total Cost of Jeans Grand Total = 11,466 + 3,099 = 14,565 Therefore, the total amount paid for all items (t-shirts and jeans) purchased from RezaraVyak and Teckas is Tk. 14,565.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all T-shirts and jeans purchased from RezaraVyak and Jarsi respectively. Total Cost = (67 x 30) + (165 x 25) = 67 x 30 = 2010 + 165 x 25 = 4125 = 6135 So, the total cost of all T-shirts and jeans is 6135 taka. Next, we need to find out how much profit they made from selling these items. Profit = Total Cost - Total Sales Total Sales = 74 x 30 + 156 x 25 = 2220 + 3900 = 6120 Therefore, their profit is: Profit = 6135 - 6120 = 15 taka.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each shirt and jeans separately.  For a shirt, the cost is $192 (10 x $19.2).  For a pair of jeans, the cost is $34 (2 x $17).   Next, let's find out how many shirts and jeans can be bought with $157.  We know that $157 is equal to 192 - 34 = 168.  So, we can buy 168/192 = 8 shirts and 168/34 = 5 pairs of jeans.  Finally, we need to find out how much one shirt costs in terms of jeans.  We know that 1 shirt costs $192, and we can buy 5 pairs of jeans for $157.  Therefore, one shirt costs 5 x $34 = $170 in terms of jeans.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each shirt and each jarsey.  Total Cost of Each Shirt = (86 x 10) + (232 x 10) = 860 + 2320 = 3180 Taka Total Cost of Each Jarsey = (254 x 10) + (43 x 10) = 2540 + 430 = 3070 Taka Now, let's calculate the number of shirts that can be bought with one jersey. Number of Shirts = Total Cost of One Jersey / Total Cost of One Shirt Number of Shirts = 3070 / 3180 = 96 So, you can buy 96 shirts with one jersey.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of each T-shirt. We know that Reza and his friends bought 51 T-shirts at a total cost of $51. So, the cost per T-shirt is: Cost per T-shirt = Total cost / Number of T-shirts Cost per T-shirt = $51 / 51 Cost per T-shirt = $1 Therefore, the cost price of each T-shirt is $1. Now, let's calculate the profit made by Reza and his friends. We know that they sold 130 T-shirts at a total value of $800. So, the profit can be calculated as follows: Profit = Total value - Total cost Profit = $800 - ($1 x 130) Profit = $800 - $130 Profit = $670 Therefore, Reza and his friends made a profit of $670 from selling the T-shirts.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 201 units of T-shirts at 217 taka per unit. We can do this by multiplying the number of units (201) by the price per unit (217):  201 x 217 = 43,577 taka Next, we need to calculate the profit made from selling each T-shirt. To do this, we subtract the purchase price (43,577 taka) from the selling price (269 taka):  269 - 43,577 = 43,308 taka Profit per unit = 43,308 taka Now, let's calculate the total profit made from selling all 201 units:  201 x 43,308 = 8,661,680 taka Total profit = 8,661,680 taka So, the profit made from selling 201 units of T-shirts at 269 taka each is 8,661,680 taka.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of each T-shirt. We know that the wholesaler sells each T-shirt for $10. So, if they sell 60 T-shirts at once, their total revenue will be: Revenue = Number of items x Price per item  = 60 x $10 = $600 Now, let's find out how much profit they make from each T-shirt sale. To do this, we subtract the cost price from the revenue: Profit = Revenue - Cost Price = $600 - $40 = $560 Per T-shirt Therefore, the wholesaler makes a profit of $560 per T-shirt sold in bulk.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five types of shirts in total.  Secondly, each type of shirt has been sold for $215. Finally, we want to find out the total revenue generated from selling all five types of shirts. To do this, we need to multiply the number of units of each type of shirt by its price. So, let's start with the first type of shirt: Type 1: 50 units x $215 = $10,750 Now, let's move on to the second type of shirt: Type 2: 30 units x $215 = $6,450 Next, we have the third type of shirt: Type 3: 20 units x $215 = $4,300 Then, there is the fourth type of shirt: Type 4: 15 units x $215 = $3,225 Lastly, we have the fifth and final type of shirt: Type 5: 10 units x $215 = $2,150 Therefore, the total revenue generated from selling all five types of shirts is: Total Revenue = $10,750 + $6,450 + $4,300 + $3,225 + $2,150 = $28,975
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of 5 daris and 215 t-shirts purchased from Rezaravyak Shop. We know that the price of one dari is Tk. 30 and the price of one t-shirt is Tk. 215. So, the total cost can be calculated as follows: Total Cost = (5 x Tk. 30) + (215 x Tk. 215) = Tk. (150 + 4975) = Tk. 5075. Next, we need to calculate the profit made by Arkansaas and Texssaas from selling 20 t-shirts and 64 jeans at their respective prices. Profit = (20 x Tk. 215) + (64 x Tk. 1800) = Tk. (4300 + 115200) = Tk. 119500. Finally, we need to find out how much money Arkansaas and Texssaas will get after deducting the cost price from the sale price. Amount Received = Profit - Total Cost = Tk. 119500 - Tk. 5075 = Tk. 68750. Therefore, the amount received by Arkansaas and Texssaas after selling 20 t-shirts and 64 jeans respectively will be Tk. 68750 each.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 76 shirts and 204 pairs of pants from Rezaravyak Shop. We know that each shirt costs Tk. 360 and each pair of pants costs Tk. 204. So, the total cost of purchasing 76 shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Cost of Shirts = Number of Shirts x Price per Shirt Total Cost of Shirts = 76 x 360 = 27,760 Taka Similarly, the total cost of purchasing 204 pairs of pants can be calculated as follows: Total Cost of Pants = Number of Pairs x Price per Pair Total Cost of Pants = 204 x 204 = 40,992 Taka Now, let's add the total cost of shirts and pants to get the grand total. Grand Total = Total Cost of Shirts + Total Cost of Pants Grand Total = 27,760 + 40,992 = 68,752 Taka Finally, we need to subtract the amount received from selling two jackets to find out the net profit or loss. Net Profit/Loss = Grand Total - Amount Received from Selling Jackets Net Profit/Loss = 68,752 - 2,000 = 66,752 Taka Therefore, the net profit from the business is Tk. 66,752.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of each shirt and jeans separately.  Cost Price of Shirt = (210 x 177) / 100 = 385.70 Tk per shirt.  
Cost Price of Jeans = (240 x 23) / 100 = 552.00 Tk per jeans. Now, let's find out the total cost of one set of shirt and jeans. Total Cost of One Set = Cost Price of Shirt + Cost Price of Jeans = 385.70 Tk + 552.00 Tk = 937.70 Tk. So, if you buy one set of shirt and jeans, it will cost you 937.70 Taka."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of each jar and each T-shirt.  Cost Price of Jar = (115 - 25) x 100 = 90 per jar.  Cost Price of T-Shirt = (113 - 78) x 100 = 35 per T-shirt. Now, let's find out how many jars can be bought with Rs. 100 if one buys only jars. Number of Jars =  100 / 90 = 1.11 (approximately). So, you can buy approximately 1.11 jars with Rs. 100 if you only buy jars. Similarly, if you want to know how many T-shirts can be bought with Rs. 100, you can calculate as follows: Number of T-shirts = 100 / 35 = 2.86 (approximately). Therefore, you can buy approximately 2.86 T-shirts with Rs. 100 if you only buy T-shirts.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 teams with 10 players each in total 50 players. Now, if each team has to play against every other team once, then the number of matches played by each team will be 4 (since there are 4 teams). So, the total number of matches played = 4 x 5 = 20 matches.  Next, we need to find out how many games each player plays on average. Since there are 10 players in each team and they play 20 matches, the average number of games played per player =  20/10 = 2 games per player.  Therefore, the number of games played by each player is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 sets of 3 chairs each in Partition-I and Partition-II respectively. So, the total number of chairs in both partitions is 2 x 3 = 6 chairs. Now, if there are 12 chairs in all, then the number of chairs in Partition-III (the remaining part) will be 12 - 6 = 6 chairs. Therefore, there will be 6 chairs in Partition-III.
Response: 1) The number of chairs in each table is 3. 2) There are 9 tables in total. So, the total number of chairs = 3 x 9 = 27 chairs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 tables in total and each table has 4 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 11 x 4 = 44 chairs. Now, we need to find out how many chairs are not occupied by any of the parties. We can do this by subtracting the number of chairs occupied by Party A from the total number of chairs. In this case, Party A occupies 7 seats (2 + 5), so the number of unoccupied chairs would be:  44 - 7 = 37 chairs. Therefore, there are 37 chairs available for other parties to use.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 tables in total and each table has 6 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60. Now, if 11 people sit at these tables, how many chairs will be occupied? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of empty chairs from the total number of chairs. In this case, we can do so by subtracting 11 (the number of people) from 60 (the total number of chairs): 60 - 11 = 49. Therefore, 49 chairs will be occupied when 11 people sit at these tables.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 tables in total and each table has 4 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 4 = 48 chairs. Now, we need to find out how many extra chairs are required for the additional 6 people. Since each chair can accommodate one person, we need 6 more chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs required = 48 + 6 = 54 chairs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four tables in total and three chairs per table. So, the total number of chairs is 3 x 4 = 12. Now, we need to find out how many people can be seated at each table. Since there are four tables, we can seat 12/4 = 3 people at each table. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can be accommodated in the party is 3 x 4 = 12.
Response: 14 x 9 = 126. Now we need to find out how many chairs are needed for each table. We know that there are 9 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, in total, there will be 9 x 14 = 126 chairs required.

We know that each month costs $460, so the total cost for five months is: Total Cost = 5 x $460 = $2300 Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of months to find out how much Luis spends per month: Monthly Spending = Total Cost / Number of Months Monthly Spending = $2300 / 5 Monthly Spending = $460 per month Therefore, Luis spends $460 per month.
Response:  First, we know that Luis has $ 1216 and spends $ 16 per week. So, how many weeks can Luis spend his money? We can calculate this by dividing $ 1216 by $ 16:  1216 ÷ 16 = 75 ( rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, Luis can spend his money for 75 weeks.
Response:  First, we know that Luis has $702 and he spends $21 per week for 26 weeks. So, how much money will be left with him after 26 weeks? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount spent = Number of weeks x Amount spent per week = 26 weeks x $21 = $546 Therefore, Luis will have $702 - $546 = $156 left with him after 26 weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Luis has to pay $1357 for 223 days of work at $6 per day. So, the total amount he needs to pay is:  1357 x 223 = $304,910  Now, if he wants to buy 78 bags of fertilizer each containing 50 kg at $25 per bag, then the total cost will be:  78 x 50 x $25 = $145,000  Therefore, the total amount Luis needs to spend is:  $304,910 + $145,000 = $450,000
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each hour of work for Luis based on his monthly salary and the number of hours he works per week. We know that Luis earns $28 per hour and works 40 hours per week (5 days x 8 hours/day). So, his weekly income is:  28 x 40 = $1,120 per week. Now, let's divide his weekly income by the number of weeks in a month to find out his daily income:  1,120 / 4 = $280 per day. Finally, we can calculate the total amount Luis spends on food for one month by multiplying his daily income by the number of days in a month:  280 x 30 = $8,400. Therefore, Luis spends $8,400 on food for one month.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Harvest Mouse will spend in one year. We know that he spends $403 per month and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total amount of money that Harvest Mouse will spend in one year is:  
$403 x 12 = $4,836  Next, we need to calculate how much money Harvest Mouse will save if he reduces his expenses by 233 hours per month. We know that he currently spends $49 per hour and he wants to reduce his expenses by 233 hours per month. So, the amount of money that Harvest Mouse will save is:  
$49 x 233 = $11,277  Now, let's add the amount that Harvest Mouse will save to the total amount that he spends in one year:  
$4,836 + $11,277 = $16,113  Therefore, Harvest Mouse will have $16,113 after reducing his expenses by 233 hours per month."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Harvest Mosume earns $368 per month. Secondly, we know that he spends $388 per month if he works for 1359 hours. Now, let's calculate how much money Harvest Mosume will spend if he works for 1400 hours in a month (which is more than 1359 hours). To do this, we need to find out how much extra he needs to spend for each additional hour worked. So, we can calculate the total amount spent as follows: Total Amount Spent = (Number of Additional Hours Worked x Hourly Wage) + Previous Monthly Expenditure Extra Hourly Wage = ($1400 - $1359) / 1359 = $0.0425/hour or $42.50/month Therefore, Harvest Mosume will spend an additional $42.50 per month if he works for 1400 hours instead of 1359 hours. So, his new monthly expenditure will be: New Monthly Expenditure = Previous Monthly Expenditure + Extra Amount Spent = $388 + $42.50 = $430.50
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Luis will have after 1181 weeks if he spends $216 per week. We know that there are 52 weeks in a year, so:  1181 weeks = 1181 x 52 = 60792 weeks Total amount spent = 216 x 60792 = $130,272 Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount to find out how much Luis will have left: Amount left = $491 - $130,272 = $-129,781 So, Luis will be left with negative $129,781.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of the liqueur for 19 weeks is $133. Now, we need to find out how much the person spends per week. To do this, we can divide the total cost by the number of weeks: $133 ÷ 19 = $7. So, the person spends $7 per week on liqueur.
Response:  First, we know that Harvest has $2 per week and spends $178 per month. Next, we need to find out how many weeks are in $178. We can do this by dividing $178 by $2: $178 ÷ $2 = 89 So there are 89 weeks in $178. Now we can calculate how much Harvest earns in a year: 89 weeks x $2 per week = $178 Therefore, Harvest earns $178 per month or $2 per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the depth of water in the bucket is 10 gunas (gallons) and there are 9 futes (pots) of water in the well. So, to find out how much water is left in the well after taking out 9 futes, we need to subtract 9 from 10.  Therefore, the amount of water left in the well is:  10 - 9 = 1 fute or 40 liters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the water in the jug is 8 feet deep.  Secondly, we know that the bucket can hold 14 feet of water.  So, if we fill the bucket with water from the jug, how much water will be left in the jug after filling the bucket? To find out, we need to subtract the depth of the bucket (14 feet) from the depth of the jug (8 feet).  8 - 14 = -6  This means that 6 feet of water will be left in the jug after filling the bucket.  Therefore, the amount of water in the jug is 6 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the water in the tank is 5 feet deep and there are 11 buckets of water in it. So, if we fill up all the buckets with water from the tank, we will have 5 x 11 = 55 gallons of water altogether. Now, if we take out 12 buckets of water from the tank, we will be left with (55 - 12) = 43 gallons of water. Therefore, the amount of water that was taken out is 12 x 8 = 96 gallons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the water in the jug is 15 gallons and there are 4 feet of water in the jug from the diner's height. So, if the diner is 13 feet away from the jug, how much water will be left in the jug after pouring out 4 feet of water for the diner? To find this, we need to subtract the height of the diner (13 feet) from the total height of water in the jug (15 + 4 = 19 feet). Therefore, the amount of water left in the jug after pouring out 4 feet for the diner would be: 19 - 13 = 6 feet or 6 gallons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the depth of water in the tank is 16 feet (given).  Secondly, we know that the diameter of the pipe through which the water flows out is 9 feet (given). Thirdly, we know that the rate of flow of water is 13 feet per second (given). Now, let's calculate the volume of water that flows out of the pipe in one second. We can do this by using the formula for the area of a circle: Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the pipe. Since the diameter of the pipe is given as 9 feet, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2: Radius = 9/2 = 4.5 feet. Now, we can use this value to calculate the area of the pipe: Area = π(4.5)^2 = 18.75 square feet. Next, we need to calculate the volume of water that flows out of the pipe in one second. We can do this by multiplying the area by the height of the water in the tank (i.e., 16 feet): Volume = Area x Height = 18.75 x 16 = 296.25 cubic feet per second. Finally, we can calculate the total volume of water that flows out of the pipe in one minute by multiplying the volume per second by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in one minute): Total Volume = Volume per second x 60 = 296.25 x 60 = 17,975 cubic feet. So, the total volume of water that flows out of the pipe in one minute is approximately 17,975 cubic feet.
"Response:  We know that the water in the jug is 9 gallons and the pitcher contains 3 gallons of water.  If we pour the entire contents of the pitcher into the jug, there will be a total of 9 + 3 = 12 gallons of water in the jug.  Now, if we subtract the amount of water that was already in the jug (3 gallons), we get 12 - 3 = 9 gallons of water left in the jug.  So, the answer to the question ""How much water is left in the jug?"" is 9 gallons."
Response:  If Brian has written 34 books in total and he has two bookstores with equal number of books, then the number of books in each bookstore would be:  34 / 2 = 17 books per bookstore.
Response: 1) The total number of books written by Brayan is 42 (given). 2) He has two self-published books (given). Therefore, the number of books published through other publishers is: 42 - 2 = 40. So, Brayan has 40 books published through other publishers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brian has written 22 books and has 80 magazines in his collection. Now, let's calculate how many books he has in total. Total number of books = Number of books written + Number of books in collection Total number of books = 22 + 80 Total number of books = 102 So, Brian has 102 books in total.
Response: 10 books x 9 issues per book = 90 issues in total. 46 magazines x 5 issues per magazine = 230 issues in total. So, Brian has 90 + 230 = 320 issues of magazines and books combined.

1. Total number of books = 29 (given) 
2. Number of magazines = 61 (given) 
3. Total number of publications = 29 + 61 = 90 
So, Brian has 90 publications in total, including 29 books and 61 magazines."
Response: 1) The number of libraries in Brayan's town is 7. 2) Each library has an equal number of books (let's assume it to be x). So, the total number of books in all the libraries combined is 7x. 3) According to the problem statement, there are 28 books in Brayan's house. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  7x + 28 =? Solution: We know that the total number of books in all the libraries combined is 7x. Now, we need to add 28 to this total to find out how many books Brayan has at home. So, we can write:  7x + 28 =? To solve for x, we can subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:  7x + 28 - 28 =? Subtracting 28 from both sides gives us:  7x = 28 Solving for x, we get:  x = 4 Since each library has 4 books, Brayan has 4 x 7 = 28 books at home.
Response: 1) The number of books written by Brayan is 38. 2) Of these, 2 are not in his own handwriting. So, we need to subtract 2 from 38. Therefore, the total number of books written by Brayan that are in his own handwriting is:  38 - 2 = 36.
Response:  If Carol has 10 friends and each friend gives her two gifts, then she will receive a total of 2 x 10 = 20 gifts. Now, if any one of her friends stops giving her gifts, she will only receive 19 gifts instead of 20. So, out of 10 friends, only one friend can stop giving gifts without affecting the total number of gifts Carol receives.
Response:  We know that there are 12 friends in total and each friend has brought an equal number of gifts. So, if one friend has brought x gifts, then all other friends have also brought x gifts. Therefore, the total number of gifts is 12x. Now, we need to find out what is the value of x. To do this, we can use the information that the total amount spent on gifts is Rs. 5000. Since each gift costs Rs. 400, the total cost of all gifts will be: Total Cost = Number of Gifts x Price per Gift = 12x x 400 = 4800x. Since the total amount spent is Rs. 5000, we can set up the equation: 4800x = 5000. Solving for x, we get: x = 5000/4800 = 1.04. Therefore, each friend has brought approximately 1.04 gifts.
Response:  If Carol has three friends and each friend gives her three gifts, then she will receive a total of 3 x 3 = 9 gifts. However, if only two of her friends give her gifts, then she will receive a total of 2 x 3 = 6 gifts. So, in this case, there will be 3 - 6 = 7 gifts left over.
Response: 1) The first three friends (Carol, Tom, and Alex) had equal shares of the cake. So each friend got 1/3 of the cake. 2) Since there were three more friends (Jenny, Lucy, and Emily), they also got an equal share of the remaining cake. So each of them got 1/3 of the remaining cake. 3) Now, let's calculate how much cake each of the six friends got in total. Carol, Tom, and Alex got 1/3 of the cake each, so they got 1/3 x 6 = 2 pieces of cake each. Jenny, Lucy, and Emily got 1/3 of the remaining cake each, so they got 1/3 x 4 = 1 piece of cake each. Therefore, each of the six friends got a total of 2 + 1 = 3 pieces of cake.
Response:  We know that Carol has three friends (Amy, Bob, and Chris), and each friend gave her three gifts. So, in total, Carol received nine gifts (3 x 3 = 9). Now, if we add one more gift to each of the three friends' packages, we will get:   Amy: 3 + 1 = 4 gifts   Bob: 3 + 1 = 4 gifts   Chris: 3 + 1 = 4 gifts  Therefore, the total number of gifts Carol would receive if each of her friends added one more gift to their package is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 gifts.
Response:  Melisa has scored 12 penalties out of 36 attempts. So she has scored 12/36 = 1/3 or 33% of her total attempts. Therefore, Melisa has scored 33% of the goals she attempted.
Response:  We know that Melissa has scored 81 points in three games, and each game is worth 27 points. So we can start by finding out how many games she played:  27 x 3 = 81  Therefore, Melissa played 3 games. Now, let's find out how many points she scored in each game:  81 / 3 = 27  So, Melissa scored 27 points in each game.
Response:  Melisa has played 109 games and scored 82 bonuses. To find out how many points she has scored in total, we need to add up all her bonus scores. So, we can calculate as follows: Total score = (82 x 7) + (82 x 9) +... + (82 x 109) Since there are 7 bonuses for each game, we can simplify the calculation like this: Total score = (82 x 7) x 109 Total score = 6346 Now we have our final answer!
Response:  If Melissa can score 21 points in 7 games, then her average score per game is:  21 / 7 = 3 points per game.  So, if she plays 6 more games, her total score will be:  3 x 6 = 18 points.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 13 points in total and each point is worth 91 pence. So, to calculate how many pounds she spent in total, we can multiply the number of points she scored by the value of one point.  Points = Pounds  Therefore, we have:  13 x 91 =?  To solve for the unknown quantity (in this case, the total amount spent), we can simply multiply 13 by 91. 13 x 91 = 1203  So, Melissa spent £1203 in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 asanas in each set of exercises. So, if 20 people can do one set together, then the total number of people who can do all four sets together is 20 x 4 = 80. Now, if each person does only one set, then the remaining 120 - 80 = 40 people cannot do any sets. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can do at least one set of exercises is 80.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 people who can stay in each flat of the society. So, if there are x flats in the society, then 9x people can stay in those flats. Now, we also know that there are 12 vacant flats in the society, so we can write an equation as follows:  9x + 12 = 108... (1) Next, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:  9x = 108 - 12 9x = 96 Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find out the number of flats:  9x/9 = 96/9  x = 11 Therefore, there are 11 flats in the society, and each flat can accommodate 9 people, making a total of 99 residents in the society.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 people in total who will be visiting the park. Of those, 15 people will be visitors and 4 people will be guides. Now, let's calculate how many groups of 20 people can be formed with these 19 individuals. We can do this by dividing 19 by 20. 19 divided by 20 is equal to 0 with a remainder of 1. This means that we cannot form exactly 20 groups of 20 people each because we have only 19 people. However, we can form 19 groups of 20 people each, since we have 19 people in total. So, the answer is 19.
Response: 10 people can fit in one car, so if there are 18 cars, we can calculate how many people can be accommodated as follows:  18 x 10 = 180 people. Therefore, 18 cars can accommodate 180 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are six people in each group and there are four groups in total. So, the total number of people is 6 x 4 = 24. Now, if we add 14 more people to each group, the new total will be 24 + 14 = 38. Therefore, the total number of people who can join is 38.
Response:  We know that there are two small ponds and one big pond in the park. The total area of the three ponds is 200 square meters (2 x 50 + 1 x 100). Now we need to find out how many people can be accommodated in each pond based on their size. Small Ponds: There are two small ponds with an area of 50 square meters each. So, if we divide 50 by 4 (since there are four people in a group), we get 12.5 as the number of groups that can be accommodated in each small pond. Big Pond: The big pond has an area of 100 square meters. If we divide 100 by 4 (since there are four people in a group), we get 25 as the number of groups that can be accommodated in the big pond. Total Number of Groups: Since there are two small ponds and one big pond, the total number of groups that can be accommodated in the park is 2 x 12.5 + 1 x 25 = 37.5 + 25 = 62.5 groups. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can visit the park is 62.5 x 4 = 250 people.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small ponds and 7 large ponds in total. Each small pond can hold 16 people, and each large pond can hold 12 people. So, we need to find out how many people can be accommodated in all the ponds together. Small Ponds: 3 x 16 = 48 people Large Ponds: 7 x 12 = 84 people Total number of people who can be accommodated in all the ponds = 48 + 84 = 132 people.
Response: 16 people can be accommodated in one car if there are four seats per row and two rows of seating. So, to calculate how many people can fit in each car, we need to divide 16 by 4 (the number of seats per row). 16 ÷ 4 = 4 Therefore, four people can fit in each car.
Response: 1) The ferry can accommodate 4 people at a time. 2) If there are 2 more passengers than the capacity of the ferry, then the number of passengers is 2 + 4 = 6. 3) So, the number of passengers that the ferry can carry is 6.
Response:  We have 7 pizzas in total and each pizza has 14 slices. So, to find out how many slices are there in all the pizzas combined, we need to multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices in one pizza.  Therefore, the total number of slices is:  7 x 14 = 98 slices.
Response:  We have two slides and we want to know how many times we can arrange them in total.  Since each slide has 18 items, let's calculate the number of arrangements for one slide first.  There are 18! = 18 × 17 × 16 ×... × 2 × 1 = 3240 possible arrangements for one slide.  Now, since we have two slides, we need to multiply this result by 2 to get the total number of arrangements:  2 × 3240 = 6480.  So, there are 6480 ways to arrange the 36 items (2 slides with 18 items each).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 pizzas in total. Secondly, each pizza has 8 slices. So, if there are 25 people eating the pizzas, how many slices of pizza will they get in total? To find out, we can divide the number of pizzas by the number of people eating them: 17 pizzas ÷ 25 people =? The result is: 17 pizzas ÷ 25 people = 680 slices of pizza (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, there will be 680 slices of pizza for the 25 people to share.
Response: 10 slides for each of our 9 friends means we need to divide 10 into 9 equal parts. We can do this easily by dividing 10 into groups of 1 and 9. So, each friend will get 1 slide + (9 x 1) = 1 slide + 9 = 10 slides.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 10 trees in total and each tree had 45 fruits. So, the total number of fruits was 10 x 45 = 450. Now, if 45 trees were added, the new total number of fruits would be 450 + (45 x 45) = 450 + 2025 = 2475. Therefore, the number of fruits increased by 2475 - 450 = 2025.
Response: 1) If they have 9 full beds and each bed has 45 beads, then they have a total of 9 x 45 = 360 beads. 2) If they want to make one more full bed with the remaining beads, they will need 45 beads (since each full bed requires 45 beads). So, they will have 360 - 45 = 315 beads left over. Therefore, if they have 9 full beds and each bed has 45 beads, they will have 315 beads left over.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 bees in total and each bee has 12 flowers to collect nectar from. So, the total number of flowers collected by all the bees is:  36 x 12 = 432 flowers Now, let's consider how many flowers each bee has to visit to collect nectar from all the flowers it can see. Since there are 58 flowers visible to each bee, each bee has to visit:  432 / 58 = 7.5 flowers per bee To find out how many flowers each bee can see, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of bees:  432 / 36 = 12 flowers per bee Therefore, each bee can see 12 flowers and needs to visit 7.5 flowers to collect nectar from all the flowers it can see.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 55 bees in total and they have collected pollen from 15 flowers each. So, the number of bees who have not collected any pollen is:  55 - 15 = 40 Now, let's calculate how many flowers each bee has visited. We know that each bee has visited 15 flowers, so the total number of flowers visited by all the bees is:  40 x 15 = 600 Finally, we can calculate the average number of flowers visited per bee as follows:  600 / 40 = 15 Therefore, the average number of flowers visited per bee is 15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pages had 10 bees in his garden and he gave 3 bees to each of his friends (Ful and Bindu). So, the number of bees left with Page is:  10 - 3 = 7 Now, let's calculate how many flowers Ful and Bindu have. We know that Ful has 3 bees and each bee can pollinate 5 flowers. So, Ful has pollinated:  3 x 5 = 15 flowers And Bindu also has 3 bees and each bee can pollinate 5 flowers. So, Bindu has pollinated:  3 x 5 = 15 flowers To find out how many flowers Page has, we need to subtract the total number of flowers pollinated by Ful and Bindu from the initial number of flowers Page had:  7 - (15 + 15) = 7 - 30 = -23 Therefore, Page has -23 flowers!
Response:  Firstly, we know that each full bed has 8 bags of fertilizer, and there are 32 bags in total. So, if they want to distribute the same amount of fertilizer among all the full beds, they will need to give 8 bags per bed. Now, let's calculate how many bags of fertilizer each partial bed needs based on the number of bags available. There are 32 bags in total, and 8 bags per full bed, so: Total bags = 32 Full bags x 8 Partial bags = (32 - 8) x 8 = 24 x 8 = 192 bags Since each partial bed needs 192 bags of fertilizer, there will be 192 / 8 = 24 partial bags. Therefore, the farmer needs 24 partial bags of fertilizer for the remaining 4 beds.
Response:  Firstly, Myathu gave two crickets to each of his 11 friends, so he gave a total of 2 x 11 = 22 crickets. Now, if Myathu had 22 crickets and gave away all of them, then he would have none left, i.e., 0 crickets. So, Myathu had 0 crickets with him at the end.
Response:  Firstly, Myathu has 8 friends. If he gives two gifts to each of his friends, then he will have given a total of 2 x 8 = 16 gifts. So, Myathu has given 16 gifts in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Myathu has 15 biscuits in total. Secondly, he gives 5 biscuits to each of his 5 friends, so he is left with 10 biscuits. Finally, we need to find out how many biscuits each friend gets. So, let's divide 15 by 5: 15 ÷ 5 = 3. Each friend gets 3 biscuits.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Myathu had 24 friends and he distributed his 30 candies equally among them. So, each friend received 30/24 = 1.25 candies. Now, if Myathu has 17 more friends than before, then the total number of his friends now is 24 + 17 = 41. Therefore, the total number of candies Myathu needs to distribute now is 30 x 41 = 1230 candies. Finally, we can say that Myathu gave 1230 / 41 = 30 candies to each of his new friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Myathu has 22 crore and 34 crores of rupees as his assets. Now, if he distributes these assets equally among his 11 friends, then each friend will get: 22 Crore / 11 = 2 Crore Each friend will receive 2 crores from Myathu.   Similarly, each friend will also receive: 34 Crore / 11 = 3 Crores Each friend will receive 3 crores from Myathu in total, making it 5 crores per person (2 + 3). Therefore, the amount each friend will receive from Myathu is 5 crores.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Myathu has 29 crore and 30 crores of rupees with him. Now, if he gives half of his money to two friends, then he will have 29 crore - 15 crore = 14 crore rupees left with him. So, each friend will get 15 crore rupees from Myathu. Therefore, the amount each friend will have is 15 crore x 2 = 30 crore rupees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Myathu has 14 friends and each of them has given him some amount of money as a gift. So, in total, Myathu has received 14 x (some amount) = 14x as gifts from his friends. Now, if he wants to distribute this amount equally among all his friends, then each friend will get 14x/14 = x amount as their share. Therefore, the answer is x amount.
Response: 18 friends of Mathu have to share equally among themselves 36 candies. So each friend will get: 36 / 18 = 2 candies.
Response: 1) If Myathu has given 6 candies to his friend, and he has 36 candies in total, then the number of candies Myathu has after giving 6 to his friend is:  36 - 6 = 30 2) Now, if Myathu has 30 candies left and gives 3 more to his friend, then the number of candies Myathu has after giving 3 more to his friend is:  30 - 3 = 27 So, Myathu has given 27 candies (6 + 3) to his friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mathu had 23 crickets in total and he gave 11 of them to his two friends as gifts. So, the number of crickets left with Mathu is:  23 - 11 = 12 Now, let's find out how many crickets each friend received from Mathu. Since there are two friends, they together received half of the remaining crickets, which is:  12 / 2 = 6 Each friend received 6 crickets from Mathu. Therefore, the answer is:  6
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mathiu had 31 biscuits in total. Secondly, he gave 5 of his friends an equal number of biscuits each (i.e., 5 x = 23). So, if we let X be the number of biscuits given to each friend, then we can set up the following equation: 31 = 5X + 23. Now, solve for X using subtraction: 31 - 5X = 23. Simplify and solve for X: 28 = 5X. Divide both sides by 5: X = 5(28/5) = 28/5 = 5.6. Since we cannot have a fraction of a biscuit, rounding up gives us X = 6. Therefore, Mathiu gave each of his 5 friends 6 biscuits.
Response: 1) The total number of friends = 4 (given in the problem statement). 2) The first person has 32 cars and 98 cakes. So, we can start with these numbers to find out how many cars and cakes each friend will have. 3) To find out how many cars each friend will have, divide the total number of cars by the number of friends: 32 / 4 = 8 cars per friend. 4) Now, let's calculate how many cakes each friend will have: 98 / 4 = 24 cakes per friend. 5) Finally, we need to find out how much each friend will have in total (cars + cakes): 8 cars x 24 cakes = 192 cars and 24 cakes. Therefore, each friend will have 192 cars and 24 cakes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four friends - Mithu, Tania, Ria and Elina. Each of them has to share equally among themselves the total number of candies they have collected. So, if they collectively have 10 candies, each friend will get 2.5 candies (10/4). Now, let's consider the case when Mithu gives 8 candies to his three friends. In this scenario, Tania, Ria and Elina will receive 8/3 = 2.67 candies each (since there are three of them). However, since we cannot have a fraction of a candy, each of them will receive 2 whole candies. Therefore, Mithu will be left with 8 - (2 x 3) = 8 - 6 = 2 candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 friends in total and each friend has to give 13 chocolates and receive 15 chocolates. So, the total number of chocolates to be given out is 28 x 13 = 364 chocolates. Now, let's calculate how many chocolates each friend will get. Each friend will receive 15 chocolates from the remaining 364 chocolates after everyone has given their 13 chocolates. Therefore, the number of chocolates each friend will get is 364 / 28 = 13 chocolates per friend.
Response:  We know that Devil sold 109 bottles of water per day for 74 days. So, we need to calculate how many bottles he sold in total. Total number of bottles = Number of days x Number of bottles per day Total number of bottles = 74 x 109 = 8236 bottles
Response:  We know that Tinu sold 153 bottles of water in total and each bottle contained 1 liter of water. So, if we divide 153 by 1, we get 153. Now, we need to find out how many days it took for the bottles to sell out if they were sold at a constant rate. To do this, we can use division again. This time, we will divide 153 by the number of bottles sold per day. Let's assume that Tinu sold x bottles per day. Then, we can write an equation:  153 = x \* (16)  Where x is the number of bottles sold per day. Solving for x, we get:  x = 9  Therefore, Tinu sold 9 bottles per day. Now, we can calculate how many days it took for all the bottles to sell out by dividing 153 by 9:  Days = 153 / 9  Days = 17  So, it took Tinu 17 days to sell all the bottles of water.
Response: 1st step: We know that Devy has 264 paisa in total. 2nd step: He spent 150 paisa per day for 11 days, so he spent a total of: 150 x 11 = 1650 paisa. 3rd step: Now we need to find out how much money is left with him after spending 1650 paisa. To do this, we subtract the amount spent from the total amount: Total amount - Amount spent = 264 - 1650 = 264 - 1650 = 0. So, there is no money left with Devy after spending 1650 paisa.
Response: 144 bottles of water is equal to how many days of drinking 14 liters of water per day? We know that 1 liter of water weighs 1 kilogram, so 14 liters of water would be equal to 14 kilograms or 14000 grams. Now, let's convert this weight into days. One person needs approximately 2 liters of water per day for survival, which is equivalent to 2 kilograms or 2000 grams. So, if someone consumes 14 liters of water per day, they will need 7 times more water than the average person, which is equivalent to 14 x 2 = 28 kilograms or 28000 grams. Therefore, if someone consumed 144 bottles of water (which is equal to 14000 grams), they would have drunk water for approximately 28000/2000 = 14 days.
Response:  We know that there are 88 days in total (4 x 22 = 88). And we also know that each day has 13 hours of sunlight and 11 hours of darkness. So, if we divide the total number of days by the number of hours of sunlight per day, we get:  88 days / 13 hours/day = 6 days  Therefore, there will be 6 days of sunlight and 82 days of darkness during this period.
"Response:  We know that there are 312 panis of boiled rice and 4 pots of soaked rice. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the soaked rice to cook if we cook one pot every day. So, let's start with the number of days it takes to cook one pot of soaked rice.  
We know that each pot of soaked rice contains 56 pieces of rice. Therefore, if we cook one pot of soaked rice per day, it will take 56 days to cook all the soaked rice. 
Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for all the soaked rice to be cooked if we cook multiple pots per day. Suppose we cook x pots of soaked rice per day (where x is a positive integer). Then, the total number of days required to cook all the soaked rice can be calculated as follows: Total days = Number of pots per day x Number of days per pot 
Substituting the values, we get: Total days = x x 56 = 56x 
Therefore, the total number of days it will take for all the soaked rice to be cooked if we cook x pots per day is 56x days."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Devy has 6 bottles of water every day. If he drinks 12 bottles in total, then he will have to drink extra water for the remaining days. So, let's calculate how many days he will have to drink extra water. Total number of days = (Total amount of water / Daily amount of water) Days = (12 bottles / 6 bottles/day) Days = 2 days Therefore, Devy will have to drink extra water for 2 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 150 bottles of water and 54 bottles of juice in total. We also know that each bottle of water has 180 ml of liquid and each bottle of juice has 250 ml of liquid. So, to calculate how many days the water will last, we need to divide the number of bottles of water by the amount of liquid in each bottle. In this case, we can do:  150 bottles / 180 ml per bottle = 83 days (approximately) Therefore, based on our calculation, the water will last for approximately 83 days if consumed at the rate of one bottle per day. Now let's move on to calculating how long the juice will last. To do this, we can use the same method as before:  54 bottles / 250 ml per bottle = 216 days (approximately) Based on our calculation, the juice will last for approximately 216 days if consumed at the rate of one bottle per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 360 people in total who drank water from the well and 162 people who did not drink water from the well. Now, if we subtract the number of people who did not drink water from the well (162) from the total number of people (360), we get:  360 - 162 = 208 So, there are 208 people left to be considered for the duration of their stay at the ashram. Next, we know that each person stayed for 12 days on average. Therefore, if we multiply the remaining number of people (208) by the average stay period (12), we get:  208 x 12 = 2576 So, the total duration of stay at the ashram would be approximately 2576 days or about 69 years.
Response: 14 pensils are there in total. Each packet contains 11 pensils. So, we can calculate as follows: Total number of pensils = Number of packets x Number of pensils in each packet Total number of pensils = 14 x 11 Total number of pensils = 154 Therefore, there are 154 pensils in total.
Response:  There are 12 pens in total. Each box contains 3 pens. So, there are 4 boxes in total. Therefore, each box has 3 x 4 = 12 pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tari has 16 pens in total and each packet contains 24 pens. So, to calculate how many packets she can make with her 16 pens, we can divide 16 by 24. 16 ÷ 24 = 0 (remainder) or 2 packets. Therefore, Tari can make 2 packets of pens using all her 16 pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 pens in total. Secondly, each pack contains 6 pens, so there are 22/6 = 3 packs of pens. Finally, each pack has 14 pens, so there are 3 x 14 = 42 pens in total. Therefore, there are 42 pens in the box.
Response:  If Fayee has 35 pens and wants to make 7 cylinders of equal size using those pens, how many pens will she have left after making each cylinder?  1st Cylinder: She uses 7 pens to make the first cylinder. So, she has 28 pens left (35 - 7 = 28).  2nd Cylinder: She uses 7 pens again to make the second cylinder. So, she has 21 pens left (28 - 7 = 21).  3rd Cylinder: She uses 7 pens once more to make the third cylinder. So, she has 14 pens left (21 - 7 = 14). And so on... After making 7 cylinders, Fayee will have 1 pen left (14 - 7 = 1). Therefore, she can make 7 cylinders with her 35 pens.

Therefore, the total number of points for all the pens is 341 + 857 = 1198.
Response:  If Fei has 30 pens and wants to distribute them equally among 5 people, then each person will get:  30 pens / 5 people = 6 pens per person.
Response:  If there are 6 pens in total and each pen has 5 bullets, then the total number of bullets is 6 x 5 = 30. So, if 2 pens have 10 bullets each, we can write:  2 x 10 = 20 + (6 x 5) = 30. Therefore, the correct answer is 20 + 30 = 50.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 35 packets of flour in total and each packet contains 4 kilograms of flour. So, to calculate how many saris can be made from all the flour, we need to divide the total weight of flour (in kg) by the weight of one sari (also in kg). We know that one sari requires 2 kilograms of flour. Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Total weight of flour = 35 x 4 kg = 140 kg Number of saris that can be made = 140 kg / 2 kg/sari = 70 saris
Response:  There are 31 packets of pens in the box, and each packet contains 6 pens. So, there are 31 x 6 = 186 pens in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 pensils and 24 creyons in total. Now, we need to find out how many pensils are there among those 30 items. To do this, we can simply divide the number of pensils (24) by the total number of items (30). So, the ratio of pensils to other items is 24/30 or 8/10. Therefore, there are 8 pensils among the 30 items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 pensils in total and each pen has 6 clips. So, if we divide 16 by 6, we get:  16 / 6 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 sets of pensils with 6 clips each. Now, let's calculate how many clips in total. We have 2 sets of pensils x 6 clips per set = 2 x 6 = 12 clips In conclusion, there are 12 clips in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 classes in the school and each class has 98 students. So, the total number of students in the school is 21 x 98 = 2078. Now, we need to find out how much food will be required for all the students if they have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at school. We can assume that each student consumes an average of 3 meals per day, so the total number of meals consumed per day is 2078 x 3 = 6234 meals. Finally, we need to calculate how much food is required for one meal. Let's assume that each meal requires 500 grams of rice, 250 grams of lentils, and 100 grams of vegetables. Therefore, the total amount of food required for one meal is 500 + 250 + 100 = 850 grams. So, the total amount of food required for all the students for one day is 6234 meals x 850 grams/meal = 532,700 grams or approximately 532 kilograms.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and each class has 95 students on average. So, to find out how many students are in the school, we can multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class. 84 x 95 =?  That gives us a total of 8060 students in the school!
Response: 1) The school has 67 classes. 2) Each class has 66 students. 3) If there are 6 assts per class, then the total number of assistants in all classes is 6 x 66 = 396. So, the required number of trips for 66 assistants to carry food for all the classes can be calculated as follows:  4) Since each trip can carry 6 people (i.e., 6 assistants), we need 396 / 6 = 66 trips. Therefore, the answer is 66 trips.
Response: 1) The school has 87 students in total. 2) There are 58 boys and 30 girls in the school. 3) If there are two sections of 40 students each, how many students will be in each section? Solution: To find out how many students will be in each section, we need to divide the total number of students (87) by the number of sections (2). So, we have: 87 ÷ 2 = 43.5  Since we can't have half a student, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 44. Therefore, there will be 44 students in each section.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 classes in the school and each class has an average of 30 students. So, the total number of students in all classes is:  24 x 30 = 720  Now, let's find out how many students are in each shift. We know that there are two shifts - morning and afternoon. The morning shift has 120 students and the afternoon shift has 60 students. Therefore, the total number of students in both shifts is:  120 + 60 = 180  Finally, we need to find out how many students are in each grade. Since there are three grades (A, B, and C), we can divide the total number of students by 3 to get the number of students in each grade:  180 / 3 = 60  So, there are 60 students in Grade A, 60 students in Grade B, and 60 students in Grade C.
Response: 1) Total number of students in the school = 66 (given) 2) Number of hostel rooms available = 8 (given) 3) Number of trips required to accommodate all students = Total number of students / Number of students per trip 4) Number of students who can be accommodated in each trip = Total number of students per room x Number of rooms available per trip 5) Therefore, the total number of trips required to accommodate all students is:  66/102 = 6 (approximately)  So, approximately six trips are required to accommodate all 66 students in the school if two students share one room.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 102 students in the school and each class has 11 students. So, if 8 students from one class go on a trip, how many classes will be left behind?  To find out, we can divide the total number of students (102) by the number of students in each class (11):  102 ÷ 11 = 9  Therefore, if 8 students from one class go on a trip, 9 classes will be left behind.
Response: 1) Total number of classrooms in the school = 72 (given) 2) Number of floors in each building = 3 (given) 3) Total number of students in the school = 111 (given) Now we need to find out how many trips are required to transport all the students from one building to another. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of students that can be accommodated in each trip. Let's assume that each trip can accommodate 50 students. So, we can calculate the number of trips as follows: Total number of students / Number of students per trip = 111 / 50 = 2.22 trips To transport all the students from one building to another, we would need approximately 2.22 trips.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 classes in the school and each class has 46 students on average. So, the total number of students in the school is:  17 x 46 = 822  Now, let's find out how much food is required for all the students. We can assume that each student requires 0.5 kg of rice per day (as it is a common quantity consumed in Bangladesh). Therefore, the total amount of rice required for all the students is:  822 x 0.5 = 411 kg  So, the answer to the question ""If all the students bring their lunch boxes filled with rice, then how many kilograms of rice will be brought to the school?"" is:  411 kg."
Response: 11 boys are playing marbles in Helly's class. If each boy has 9 marbles, then how many marbles have been played altogether?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of boys by the number of marbles they have: 11 x 9 =?  Can you solve this multiplication problem and tell me the total number of marbles played?
Response:  If there are 10 boys in Helier's class and each boy has 5 marbles, then the total number of marbles is 10 x 5 = 50 marbles. So, if Helier gives 5 marbles to each of the 5 boys who have no marbles, he will give away a total of 5 x 5 = 25 marbles. Therefore, Helier will be left with 50 - 25 = 25 marbles.
Response:  There are four friends in Helier's class who want to play marbles together. Each of them has 22 marbles and wants to keep 15 for themselves. So, if they divide the total number of marbles equally among themselves, how many marbles will each friend get?   Solution: To find out how many marbles each friend will get, we need to divide 22 (total number of marbles) by 4 (number of friends). 22 ÷ 4 = 5 with a remainder of 3. Since there is no fractional part of a marble, each friend will receive 5 complete marbles, and the remaining 3 marbles will be left over. Therefore, each friend will get 5 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money each of the 13 boys will get if they sell their cards for Tk. 500 each. We can do this by multiplying the number of cards each boy has (which is 5) by the price per card (Tk. 500):  13 x 5 = 650  Now, let's add up all these amounts to find out how much money all 13 boys together will have if they sell their cards at Tk. 500 each:  650 + 650 +... + 650 = 8,450  Finally, we need to subtract the amount that each boy spent on buying the cards from the total amount they will have if they sell them. This will give us the net profit each boy will make:  8,450 - 260 = 8,190  So, each of the 13 boys will make a net profit of Tk. 8,190 if they sell their cards for Tk. 500 each.
Response:  There are 20 marbles in total, and each boy has to collect an equal number of marbles. So, if there are two boys, they will collect half of the total marbles i.e., 10 marbles each.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank spent 22 days in the hospital and was discharged on the 56th day after his injury. So, he spent 34 days (56 - 22) in the hospital.
Response: 1) The book was read for 6 days (given). 2) Each day, Frank read 4 pages (given). Therefore, to find out how many pages Frank read in total, we need to multiply the number of days he read the book by the number of pages he read per day. So, Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day Total pages = 6 x 4 = 24 pages Frank read 24 pages of the book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank spent 555 days in prison for each of his five crimes. So, if we multiply 555 by 5, we get:  555 x 5 = 2775 days  This means that Frank spent a total of 2775 days (or approximately 7 years and 3 months) in prison.
Response: 1500 (one thousand five hundred) is the total number of pages in Frank's book. To calculate how many days it took to read the book, we need to divide the number of pages by the average number of pages per day that Frank could read. We know that Frank could read 66 pages per day, so let's do the calculation:  1500 pages / 66 pages/day = 23 days Therefore, it took Frank 23 days to read his entire book.
Response: 1) The book was read for 249 pages. 2) It took Frank three days to finish the book. So, he read 83 pages per day (249 / 3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank read 66 pages of one book and took 12 days to finish it. So, if he reads at the same pace, how many books can he read in 492 days (the total number of days he has been reading)? To find out, we need to calculate how many pages Frank can read in one day. We know that he reads 66 pages in 12 days, so: Number of pages per day = Total pages / Number of days = 66 pages / 12 days = 5.5 pages/day Now, let's calculate how many books Frank can read in 492 days: Number of books = Total pages / Number of pages per day = 492 pages / 5.5 pages/day = 89 books Therefore, Frank can read 89 books in 492 days if he maintains his current pace.
Response: 16 days have passed since Frank started writing his book. If he writes 12 pages per day, how many pages will he write in total? Solution: We know that Frank has been writing for 16 days, so he has written 16 x 12 = 192 pages so far.
Response: 1) Total number of pages in the book is 576. 2) Frank reads 8 pages per day. To find out how many days it will take for him to finish reading the entire book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day. So, 576 / 8 = 72 days. Therefore, it will take Frank 72 days to finish reading the entire book if he reads 8 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank spent 30 days in jail and he had to write 41 letters during his stay. So, if we divide 41 by 30, we get an average of 1.37 letters per day. Now, let's calculate how many pages Frank wrote each day. We know that each letter was approximately 500 words long, so if we multiply 500 by 1.37, we get an average of 685 words per day. Finally, since there are 450 pages in total, we can divide 685 by 450 to find out how many pages Frank wrote each day, which gives us an average of 1.52 pages per day.
Response: 1) The book was written in French. 2) There were three authors. 3) Each author wrote 594 pages. 4) It took 607 days to complete the book. To find out how many pages each author wrote, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of authors: Total pages = 594 x 3 = 1782 pages Per author = 1782 / 3 = 594 pages So, each author wrote 594 pages.
Response: 1) The number of days Frank spent writing his book = Total number of pages in the book x Number of words per page. 2) We know that there are 405 pages in the book and each page has approximately 250 words (as mentioned in the problem). So, we can calculate the total number of words as follows: Total number of words = Total number of pages x Words per page. 3) Now we have all the information to find out how many words Frank wrote per day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of words by the number of days he spent writing the book: Words written per day = Total number of words / Number of days. Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get: Words written per day = 66,400 / 66 days. Simplifying, we get: Words written per day = 1008 words per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are six packets of 120 dal each. So, the total number of dals is 6 x 120 = 720 dals. Now, let's calculate the cost per packet. We know that the cost of one packet is Tk. 120. Therefore, the cost per packet is Tk. 120. Finally, to find out the total cost, we need to multiply the cost per packet by the total number of packets, i.e., Tk. 120 x 6 = Tk. 720.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of 81 units of packaging materials at Rs 33 per unit. Total Cost = Number of Units x Price Per Unit Total Cost = 81 x 33 Total Cost = 2643 Therefore, the cost of 33 packets of 81 units each would be Rs 2643.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the difference between PK and P is 107 (106 + 1). So, if we subtract 107 from PK, we will get P. Therefore, to find out how many packets of rice can be bought with Rs 93, we need to subtract 107 from PK. Here it goes:  93 - 107 =? Solution:  We have calculated as follows:  93 - 107 = 14 Now, we have found out that with Rs 93, you can buy 14 packets of rice (each packet costs PK).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of rice per kilogram is Tk.76. So, if you buy 25 kg of rice, the total cost will be:  25 x 76 = 1900 taka.  Now, let's calculate how much money you need to pay for each packet of 25 kg rice. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the number of packets:  1900 / 4 = 475 taka per packet.  Therefore, you need to pay 475 taka for each packet of 25 kg rice.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money is needed for 104 days of living expenses based on the current monthly expenditure of Tk. 26,000.  To do this, we can multiply the current monthly expenditure by the number of months required to cover the entire period of 104 days. So, 104 days / 30 days per month = 3.47 months (rounded off to 3 months).   Therefore, the amount required for 104 days of living expenses would be:  3 x Tk. 26,000 = Tk. 78,000.
Response:  To calculate the cost of a divider packer, we need to consider several factors such as the size and weight of the product, the number of layers, and the type of materials used.  Here is a rough estimate based on some assumptions:  * Size of the product: Let's assume the product is a standard 12-inch x 12-inch x 6-inch box (L x W x H).  * Weight of the product: Let's assume the product weighs around 5 pounds.  * Number of layers: Let's assume there are three layers in the divider packer.  * Materials used: Let's assume the divider packer is made of plastic.  Based on these assumptions, here is an estimated cost breakdown for the divider packer:  * Plastic material cost: $3 per pound x 5 pounds = $15  * Manufacturing cost: $5 per unit x 3 units = $15  Total cost: $15 + $15 = $30  Therefore, the estimated cost of a divider packer for a 12-inch x 12-inch x 6-inch box with three layers made of plastic would be around $30.
Response:  If there are 18 balls in total and we divide them into two groups of 2 each, then we have:   Group 1 (balls): 2 + 2 = 4 balls Group 2 (balls): 2 + 2 = 4 balls So, in total, we have 4 + 4 = 8 balls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 140 groups of 127 people each in total. So, the total number of people is 140 x 127 = 18,380. Now, if we divide this number by 127 (the number of people in each group), we get:  18,380 / 127 = 146 groups. Therefore, there are 146 groups of people in the gathering.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 203 coconuts and 63 coconut groups. Next, we know that each group has an average of 7 coconuts. So, to find out how many coconuts are in each group, we can divide the total number of coconuts (203) by the number of groups (63): 203 ÷ 63 = 3.25 Therefore, there are approximately 3.25 coconuts in each group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 142 coins in total and 356 balls. Now, if we divide the coins into 47 groups of equal size (since there are 47 coins), each group will have:  142 / 47 = 3 coins per group So, there will be 3 x 47 = 141 coins left over after distributing all the coins into groups. Similarly, if we distribute the 356 balls into 178 groups of equal size (since there are 178 balls), each group will have:  356 / 178 = 2 balls per group So, there will be 2 x 178 = 356 balls left over after distributing all the balls into groups. Therefore, the number of coins in each group is 141, and the number of balls in each group is 356.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 196 groups in total and each group has an average of 392 calories. So, to find out how many calories are there in each group, we can divide 392 by 196. 392 ÷ 196 = 2 Here is the calculation:  392 ÷ 196 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 calories in each group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1200 pieces of gold in total. Secondly, each group has 180 grams of gold. Therefore, to find out how many groups there are, we can divide the total amount of gold by the weight of each group: 1200 / 180 = 6.67 (approximately). So, there are approximately 7 groups of 180 grams of gold each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 870 coins in total and 290 of them belong to two groups. So, the number of coins left for each group is:  870 - 290 = 580 Now, we need to find out how many coins are needed to make up each group. We know that there are 93 coins in each group, so we can set up an equation as follows:  580 / 93 = x Where 'x' represents the number of groups. Solving for x, we get:  x = 6 Therefore, there are six groups of 93 coins each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 384 items in total and 192 items in each group. So, if we divide 384 by 192, we get:  384 ÷ 192 = 2 Therefore, there will be 2 groups of 192 items each. Now, let's calculate the number of items in each group. We know that there are 160 items in each group, so:  192 - 160 = 32 Items in each group.
Response: 1) If he has 38 cups of rice and wants to distribute them equally among 19 people, then each person will get: 38 / 19 = 2 cups of rice. So, he has distributed 2 cups of rice to each of the 19 people. Now, let's calculate how many cups of rice are left with him: 38 - (2 x 19) = 38 - 38 = 0 cups of rice left with him. Therefore, he has no rice left with him after distributing it equally among all the 19 people.
Response:  If each person needs 30 cups of rice and there are 14 people in total, then we can calculate how many cups of rice the mother has prepared as follows: 14 x 30 = 420 cups of rice.
Response:  We know that Brandi has 5 children and she made 22 cups of juice in total. Since each child drank 17 cups of juice, we can say that each child drank half of the total amount of juice (22/2 = 11). So, if there were x number of children drinking juice, they would have drunk 11x cups of juice in total. Therefore, the number of children who drank juice is 5 (since 5 children drank 11 times 5 = 55 cups of juice).
Response: 10 people ate 18 dishes of food in total. That means each person ate 18/10 = 1.8 dishes on average. Since there were 9 people who did not eat any extra rice, they only ate their share of the 18 dishes, which is 18 x 9 = 162 dishes. The remaining 10 people ate an extra 18 dishes, so they ate a total of 18 x 10 = 180 dishes. Therefore, the total number of dishes eaten by all 19 people is 162 + 180 = 342 dishes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brandi has 2 children and each child needs $14 worth of toys. So, in total, Brandi needs $28 for both her children (2 x $14). Now, if she gives only one toy to each child, she will need half of $28, which is $14. Therefore, Brandi can buy 14 toys with $14.
Response: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Brandi has made 8 cups of tea for her mother and 2 cups for herself.
Response:  If Frank has 42 apples and he gives 2 bags to each of his friends, then how many apples will be left with him?  We know that one bag contains 21 apples, so we can start by finding out how many bags Frank will have after giving 2 bags to each friend.  Bag = 21 Apples So, if Frank gives 2 bags to each of his friends, he will give away 2 x 2 = 4 bags in total. Now, let's find out how many apples are left with Frank. To do this, we need to subtract the number of apples in the bags he gave away from the total number of apples he had. Total apples = 42 Apples Bags given away = 4 x 21 = 84 Apples Therefore, Number of apples left with Frank = 42 - 84 = 0 Apples There are no apples left with Frank!
"Response:  If he has 26 bags of rice and each bag contains 33 pounds of rice, then we can calculate how many pounds of rice he has in total as follows:  
Total weight of rice = Number of bags x Weight per bag  Total weight of rice = 26 x 33  Total weight of rice = 858 pounds (or approximately 400 kilograms) So, he has 858 pounds (or approximately 400 kilograms) of rice in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank had 33 misses and he won 24 times. So, if we subtract 33 from 24, we get: 24 - 33 = -9 Now, let's divide the number of wins (24) by the total number of games played (which is 33 + 9 = 42): 24 / 42 = 0.5714285714285714 (approximately 0.57) Therefore, Frank would win approximately 0.57 games out of every 100 games he plays.
"Response:  If Frank has 11 items and each item costs $2, then his total cost would be: 

$2 x 11 = $22

So, if he has 2 more items that cost $2 each, his new total cost would be:

$22 + ($2 x 2) = $22 + $4 = $26

Therefore, if Frank has 2 more items, he will have a total of 13 items (11 original items + 2 additional items)."
Response:  We know that each bag contains 16 mangoes and there are two bags in total. So, we can start by multiplying the number of bags by the number of mangoes in each bag to find out how many mangoes there are in total:  2 bags x 16 mangoes/bag = 32 mangoes  Therefore, there are 32 mangoes in total.
Response: 14 boxes of 25 cases each means there are 350 cases in total (14 x 25 = 350). Now, Sharli has to transport these 350 cases using her truck. Since she has a capacity of 14 boxes per trip, she will make 350/14 = 25 trips to deliver all the cases.
Response:  If Sharli has 10 boxes of chocolates and each box contains 5 cases, then she has a total of 10 x 5 = 50 cases of chocolates.  Now, if she sells each case for Tk. 500, her total revenue will be 50 x Tk. 500 = Tk.  25,000.
Response:  We know that the regular store has 67 bottles and the discounted store has 9 bottles. To find out how many more bottles are in the regular store than the discounted store, we can subtract the number of bottles in the discounted store from the number of bottles in the regular store. So, we can say:  67 - 9 =?  The difference between the two stores is 58 bottles. Therefore, there are 58 more bottles in the regular store than in the discounted store.
Response:  We know that the regular soap has 22 bottles and the detergent soap has 61 bottles. To find out how many more bottles of detergent soap there are than regular soap, we need to subtract the number of bottles of regular soap from the number of bottles of detergent soap. So, we can ask: How many bottles of detergent soap are there more than regular soap?  Solution:  61 - 22 = 39 There are 39 more bottles of detergent soap than regular soap.
Response:  We know that there were 30 small bottles of shampoo, and each contained 80 ml of liquid. So, we can calculate the total amount of shampoo as follows: Total amount of shampoo = Number of small bottles x Volume of each small bottle Total amount of shampoo = 30 x 80 mL Total amount of shampoo = 2400 mL Now, let's move on to the large bottles. There were 8 such bottles, and each contained 1 liter of liquid. So, we can calculate the total amount of shampoo as follows: Total amount of shampoo = Number of large bottles x Volume of each large bottle Total amount of shampoo = 8 x 1000 mL Total amount of shampoo = 8000 mL Finally, we need to add the total amounts of shampoo from both the small and large bottles to get the grand total. Grand total = Total amount of shampoo from small bottles + Total amount of shampoo from large bottles Grand total = 2400 mL + 8000 mL Grand total = 10400 mL Therefore, the total amount of shampoo was 10400 milliliters (or 10.4 liters).
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles in the supermarket is 79 (79 x 12 = 948).  Of these, 53 are direct sales (53 x 12 = 636), and there are 42 apples (42 x 12 = 504). So, the difference between the two is:  948 - 636 = 312  Therefore, the number of bottles in the supermarket minus the direct sales is 312.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 54 units of direct sales and 83 units of non-returnable goods in total. Now, if we subtract the number of non-returnable goods from the total number of units sold, we will get the number of returnable goods. So, the calculation is as follows: Total Units Sold = 54 + 83 = 137 Units Returnable Goods = Total Units Sold - Non-Returnable Goods 137 - 83 = 54 Therefore, there were 54 units of returnable goods.
Response:  We know that there were 16 bottles of regular soda and 29 bottles of all other types of soda. So, we can start by adding these two numbers together to get the total number of bottles:  16 + 29 = 45 Now, we are told that there were 9 regular soda bottles and 8 other types of soda bottles that were not delivered. So, we need to subtract these numbers from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles of each type were delivered:  45 - 9 - 8 =? To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable (in this case, x represents the number of bottles of each type that were delivered). We can do this by first subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:  45 - 9 = 36 Then, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:  36 - 8 = 28 Therefore, there were 28 bottles of each type of soda delivered.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 190 items of regular socks and 60 items of bootleg socks in total. Now, if we subtract the number of bootleg socks from the total number of items, we get the number of regular socks as follows: Total items - Bootleg socks = 190 + 60 - 60 = 130 So, there were 130 regular socks in the store.
Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of soft drinks in total. Of those, 32 were diet sodas and 40 were regular sodas. So, how many more bottles of regular soda were there than diet sodas? To find out, we need to subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of bottles. Total bottles = 72 Number of diet sodas = 32 Subtracting 32 from 72 gives us: Total bottles - diet sodas = 72 - 32 = 40 There are 40 more bottles of regular soda than diet sodas. Therefore, if there were 32 diet sodas, then there must have been 40 + 32 = 72 regular sodas.
Response:  We know that there were 36 apples in total. Of those, 80% (or 28) were good quality and 54 (or 16%) were not so good quality. So, we can calculate the number of bad quality apples as follows: Total number of apples = 36 Good quality apples = 28 Bad quality apples = 36 - 28 = 8 Now, let's find out how many bottles of each type were sold. We know that 80% of the good quality apples were sold as bottled apple juice, which is equal to 28 x 80% = 22.4 bottles. Similarly, 16% of the good quality apples were sold as chopped apples, which is equal to 28 x 16% = 4.32 bottles. In addition, all the bad quality apples were sold as chopped apples, which is equal to 8 x 100% = 8 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles sold was: Bottled apple juice = 22.4 + 4.32 = 26.72 Chopped apples = 8 So, the answer is: There were 26.72 bottles of bottled apple juice and 8 bottles of chopped apples sold.
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were empty. So, we can start by subtracting 28 from 30 to find out how many full bottles were left.  30 - 28 = 2 Full bottles were left. Now, we need to find out how many diet soda bottles were left. We know that all the diet soda bottles were not empty, so we can add the number of diet soda bottles that were not empty to the number of full bottles. In this case, there were 2 diet soda bottles that were not empty. Therefore, the total number of diet soda bottles left was: 2 + 2 = 4 Diet soda bottles were left.
Response:  We know that there are four bottles of juice in total. Each bottle contains 79 ml of juice. So we can calculate how much juice is available in all the bottles as follows: Total amount of juice = (Number of bottles x Amount of juice per bottle) Total amount of juice = (4 x 79) Total amount of juice = 316 ml Therefore, there are 316 ml of juice available in all the four bottles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 57 bottles of ghee in one carton. Secondly, there were 26 bottles of date puree in another carton. Thirdly, there were 27 bottles of light soap in yet another carton. So, to find out the total number of bottles, we need to add up all these numbers. Therefore, the total number of bottles is: 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 bottles.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of bottles in the supermarket is 81 (80 + 1). Now, we are given that the number of bottles in the dairy section is 60 and the number of bottles in the light section is 60 as well. So, if we subtract the number of bottles in the dairy section from the total number of bottles in the supermarket, we get:  81 - 60 = 21 This means there are 21 more bottles in the supermarket than in the dairy section. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many more bottles were there in the supermarket than in the dairy section?"" is 21."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 students in total. Of those, 40 students bought sweaters and 9 did not buy any sweaters. So, to find out how many students bought sweaters, we can multiply 40 by 2 (since each sweater costs $2). Therefore, the total amount of money spent on sweaters is:  40 x 2 = $80 Now, let's calculate how much money was spent on socks. We know that 9 students did not buy any sweaters, but they still bought socks. Since each pair of socks costs $1, we can multiply 9 by 2 (since each student bought two pairs of socks) to get the total amount of money spent on socks:  9 x 2 = $18 Finally, we add up the amounts spent on sweaters and socks to get the total amount of money spent at the store: $80 + $18 = $98
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 317 students in the class. Now, if 295 students passed the exam, then the number of students who did not pass is:  317 - 295 = 22. So, 22 students did not pass the exam.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 703 passengers on board when the ship left port. Secondly, we are given that 246 passengers disembarked at the first port. So, to find out how many passengers remained on board after the first port, we need to subtract 246 from 703. Therefore, the number of passengers remaining on board after the first port is:  703 - 246 = 457 Now, we are asked to find out how many passengers embarked or disembarked at each of the next 25 ports. However, since we have already found out that 246 passengers disembarked at the first port, we can safely assume that no passengers embarked or disembarked at any of the subsequent ports. Hence, the total number of passengers who embarked or disembarked at all 25 ports combined is zero (0). Therefore, the final answer is:  457
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the previous day (666), there were 666 passengers. Now, if we subtract 666 from 1000 (the total number of passengers on both days), we get: 1000 - 666 = 334 So, on the second day (the day after 666), there were 334 passengers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 132 students in the previous day's examination. Now, if 406 students appeared in today's examination, then the total number of students who have appeared in both the examinations will be:  132 + 406 = 538.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 45 students in the previous day's batch of Bakirhat Palash. Now, if 829 students attended the examination today, and 10% of them were from Bakirhat Palash, then the number of students from Bakirhat Palash who attended the examination today can be calculated as follows:  829 x 0.1 = 82.9 (since 10% of 829 is equal to 82.9) Therefore, the number of students from Bakirhat Palash who attended the examination today is 82.9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 71 people in the party. Secondly, we are told that 557 people visited the place where they had their meal. So, if we divide 557 by 71, we get an average of approximately 7.8 (557 ÷ 71 = 7.8). Therefore, the average number of visitors per day was around 7.8.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 39 pictures in Bakinham Palace. Secondly, we know that 661 visitors came to see the palace on one day. Now, let's calculate how many visitors came per day on average. To do this, we will divide the total number of visitors (661) by the number of days they visited (one day). So, the calculation is: 661 / 1 = 661 visitors per day. Therefore, the answer is 661 visitors per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 92 students in the class who passed the examination. Now, if 419 students appeared for the examination and only 92 passed, then the number of students who failed the examination can be calculated as follows:  419 - 92 = 327. So, 327 students failed the examination.
Response:  We know that there were 512 students in total who attended the program. Of those, 471 students attended on one of the previous days and 808 students attended on another day. So, we can calculate the number of students who attended both days as follows:  512 - 471 = 89 (students who attended both days)
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 705 students in the class. Now, if 191 students left the school, how many students will be left? We can subtract 191 from 705 to get the answer. So, 705 - 191 = 514. Therefore, there will be 514 students left in the class after 191 students have left.
Response: 159 grams of rice can be cooked with 628 grams of water. So, if we want to know how much water is needed for 100 grams of rice, we can divide 628 by 159. 628 ÷ 159 = 4.03 Therefore, 100 grams of rice requires 403 milliliters (or 4 liters and 300 milliliters) of water to cook.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total cost of all the ingredients is Tk. 49 per kg. Now, let's calculate how much it would cost to make one serving (30g) of rice and lentils for 288 people. We can start by calculating the cost of each ingredient separately. Rice: 1 cup of uncooked rice = 150g x 288 servings = 42,640g or 42.64 kg Cost of rice = Tk. 49 x 42.64 kg = Tk. 2,075 Lentils: 1 cup of dried lentils = 150g x 288 servings = 42,640g or 42.64 kg Cost of lentils = Tk. 49 x 42.64 kg = Tk. 2,075 Total cost of rice and lentils = Tk. 2,075 + Tk. 2,075 = Tk. 4,150 So, the total cost of making one serving (30g) of rice and lentils for 288 people is Tk. 4,150.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the materials needed for constructing one check dam. We know that cement is required at the rate of 1 bag per 20 kg of sand and gravel. So, for 1 m3 of concrete, we need (1/20) x 1 bag = 0.05 bags of cement. Since we need 1 m3 of concrete for every 10 m of check dam, we need 0.05 x 10 = 0.5 bags of cement for every 10 m of check dam. Now, let's calculate the total quantity of cement required for constructing a check dam of length 57 m. Total quantity of cement = Number of bags of cement x Length of check dam in meters Therefore, Total quantity of cement = 0.5 x 57 = 28.5 bags of cement. Next, we need to calculate the total quantity of sand and gravel required for constructing the check dam. We know that 1 m3 of concrete requires 4/5th of sand and gravel each. So, for every 10 m of check dam, we need (4/5) x 10 = 8 cubic meters of sand and gravel each. Therefore, total quantity of sand and gravel required for constructing a check dam of length 57 m = 8 x 57 = 456 cubic meters. Finally, we can calculate the total cost of constructing the check dam by multiplying the total quantity of materials used by their respective costs. Cost of constructing check dam = Total quantity of cement x Cost per bag of cement + Total quantity of sand and gravel x Cost per cubic meter of sand and gravel Therefore, Cost of constructing check dam = 28.5 x Tk. 350 + 456 x Tk. 50 = Tk. 9,825 + Tk. 22,800 = Tk. 32,625.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much of the total amount (557 grams) is already consumed (17 grams).  So, if we subtract 17 from 557, we get:  557 - 17 = 539 Now, let's divide the remaining amount (539 grams) by the number of servings per package (4):  539 / 4 = 134.25 grams per serving Therefore, each serving contains approximately 134.25 grams of rice.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the current monthly income of Tareq is 11000 rupees and his expenses are 4920 rupees. So, his savings per month = Total Income - Total Expenses Savings = 11000 - 4920 = 6080 rupees Now, if he wants to save 50% of his total income, then his new monthly income will be half of his current income. New Monthly Income = Current Monthly Income / 2 New Monthly Income = 11000 / 2 = 5500 rupees Therefore, Tareq needs to increase his income by 3520 rupees (5500 - 4920) to achieve his goal of saving 50% of his total income.
Response: 1) Firstly, we need to calculate how many drums of water are needed for each day. To do this, we can divide the total amount of water required (940 liters) by the number of days (6). This gives us: 940 liters / 6 days = 156.7 liters per day. 2) Next, we need to convert this value into drum units. Since there are 30 liters in a drum, we can multiply the previous result by 30 to get: 156.7 liters x 30 = 4691 liters per day. So, to meet the daily requirement of 940 liters, we would need approximately 4691 liters or 156.7 drums of water per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 266 pickers who will work for 5 days and each day they will collect 90 drums of garbage. So, in total, they will collect 266 x 5 = 1330 drums of garbage. Now, let's calculate how many drums of garbage they will collect per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of drums collected (1330) by the number of days they will work (5): 1330 / 5 = 266 drums per day.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many days it will take for 294 people to drink 244 dramas of water if each person drinks 47 dramas per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of dramas (244) by the number of people (294): 244 ÷ 294 = 0.83 So, it will take approximately 0.83 days (or 20 hours and 45 minutes) for all 294 people to drink 244 dramas of water if they consume 47 dramas per day.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many days it would take for 235 people to drink 100 dram of rasgulla if they consume one drama per day. To do this, we can divide 100 by 235:  100 / 235 = 0.43  So, it would take approximately 43 days for all 235 people to finish 100 dram of rasgulla at the rate of one drama per day. Now, let's calculate how long it would take for them to finish 221 dram of angura if they consume one drama per day. We can use the same formula:  221 / 235 = 0.94  Therefore, it would take approximately 94 days for all 235 people to finish 221 dram of angura at the rate of one drama per day. Finally, we need to find out how many days it would take for them to finish both rasgulla and angura together. We can add the two numbers:  43 + 94 = 137  So, it would take approximately 137 days for all 235 people to finish both rasgulla (100 dram) and angura (221 dram) together at the rate of one drama per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 57 days in total and each day has 108 dram of angur. So, the total amount of angur is:  57 x 108 = 6234  Now, we are told that he can sell 252 drums per day. So, if he sells all the angur for 252 drums per day, then the number of days he can sell the entire stock of angur is:  6234 / 252 = 24 days Therefore, the answer is 24 days.
Response: 1) We know that each drum can hold 8 pails of water. So if we have 36 drums, we can fill 36 x 8 = 288 pails of water in total. 2) To calculate how many days it would take to fill 240 drums with water, we need to divide the number of pails of water we can fill (288) by the number of pails per day (8). This gives us: Number of days = Total pails / Daily pails  = 288 / 8 = 36 days Therefore, it would take 36 days to fill 240 drums with water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 26 units of electricity in one kilowatt-hour (kWh). So, if we want to calculate how much electricity is required for heating water, we need to know how many liters of water needs to be heated and at what temperature.  Suppose we have a tank of 500 liters of water and we want to heat it from 15°C to 30°C. We can use the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the amount of energy required, m is the mass of water (in kg), c is the specific heat capacity of water (approximately 4.184 J/g°C), and ΔT is the change in temperature (in °C).  Using this formula, we get: Q = 500 kg x 4.184 J/g°C x (30°C - 15°C) = 792 kWh  Therefore, it would require approximately 792 kWh of electricity to heat 500 liters of water from 15°C to 30°C.
Response:  There were 40 ships in total. Each ship had two captains. So, there were 2 x 40 = 80 captains in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 56 units of electricity consumed in total. Secondly, we know that each unit of electricity is equivalent to 1000 cubic meters of water. Therefore, to find out how much water is required for producing 56 units of electricity, we can multiply the number of units of electricity by 1000. So, the amount of water required for producing 56 units of electricity is:  56 x 1000 = 56,000 cubic meters of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 74 fish in total in the pond. Of these, 22 fish have silver scales and golden eyes (as per the information provided). So, the number of fish with silver scales and golden eyes is 22. Now, let's find out how many fish have only silver scales but not golden eyes. To do this, we need to subtract the number of fish with both silver scales and golden eyes from the total number of fish in the pond. Therefore, the number of fish with only silver scales but no golden eyes can be calculated as follows: Total number of fish - Number of fish with silver scales and golden eyes = 74 - 22 = 52. So, there are 52 fish in the pond that have only silver scales but no golden eyes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 units of electricity in each kilowatt-hour (kWh). So, if we want to find out how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) are required to power 150 fans for one hour, we need to multiply the number of fans by the time period.   Therefore, to calculate the total kWh required, we can use the formula: Total kWh = Number of Fans x Time Period  In this case, the number of fans is 150 and the time period is 1 hour. So, we can plug these values into the formula like this: Total kWh = 150 x 1 = 150 kWh  To convert this value from kilowatt-hours to watts, we divide by 1000 since there are 1000 watts in 1 kilowatt: 150 kWh / 1000 = 150,000 watts  Finally, to determine the total amount of energy consumed in megawatt-hours (MWh), we can multiply the result by 1000 since there are 1000 megawatt-hours in 1 gigawatt-hour: 150,000 watts x 1000 = 150 MWh  There are 365 days in a year, so to calculate the total amount of energy consumed per day, we can divide the total megawatt-hours by the number of days: 150 MWh / 365 = approximately 412 kWh per day  Based on this calculation, it would take approximately 412 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per day to power 150 ceiling fans for 8 hours a day, assuming an efficiency of 60 watts per fan.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 blocks in total and each block has 32 jhangi meals. So, if we divide 20 by 32, we get: 20 / 32 = 6 Therefore, there will be 6 jhangi meals per block.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many blocks of 78 can be made from 190 bricks. To do this, we divide 190 by 78: 190 ÷ 78 = 245/78 = 3 Now we have 3 complete blocks of 78 bricks each. Next, we need to find out how many extra bricks are left over after making these three blocks. To do this, we subtract the number of bricks in each block (78) from 190: 190 - 3 x 78 = 190 - 234 = 56 So there are 56 extra bricks left over after making three blocks of 78 bricks each. Therefore, if you want to make 30 blocks of 78 bricks each using 190 bricks, you will have 3 blocks of 78 bricks each and 56 extra bricks left over.
"Response:  We know that each block has 8 junk mail and there are 32 total blocks. So we can start by multiplying 8 by 32 to get the total number of junk mails in all the blocks:  8 x 32 = 256 Now we need to find out how many buildings (or ""blocks"") there are in total. To do this, we can divide the total number of junk mails by the number of junk mails per block:  256 ÷ 8 = 32 blocks Therefore, there are 32 blocks in total."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many blocks of 81 can be constructed using 4 bricks. We know that 4 bricks make 1 block of 81, so we can construct 81/4 = 20 blocks of 81 using 4 bricks. Now, let's calculate how many jhangi (brick) will be left if we use 12 bricks to build 4 blocks of 81. We know that 12 bricks make 4 blocks of 81, so we can leave out 4 x 81 = 324 bricks while building 4 blocks of 81 using 12 bricks. Therefore, the number of jhangis (bricks) left after building 4 blocks of 81 using 12 bricks is 324 - 20 = 304 bricks. So, the answer is 304.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many blocks of 4 houses each will be required to build 16 houses in total. We can do this by dividing 16 by 4, which gives us:  16 ÷ 4 = 4 So, we need 4 blocks of 4 houses each to build 16 houses. Now, let's calculate how many jhangi (bricks) are needed for each block. Since there are 3 houses in each block, and each house requires 2 jhangis, we can calculate the number of jhangis needed for each block as follows:  3 houses x 2 jhangis per house = 6 jhangis per block Therefore, we need 6 jhangis per block x 4 blocks = 24 jhangis in total to build all 16 houses.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many groups of 10 can be made from 20 marbles. We know that 20 divided by 10 is equal to 2 with a remainder of 0 (since there are no remainders when dividing integers). Therefore, we can make 2 groups of 10 marbles each. Now, let's see how many groups of 4 can be made from the remaining 10 marbles. We know that 10 divided by 4 is equal to 2 with a remainder of 1 (since there is one marble left over). So, we can make 2 groups of 4 marbles each and one group of 1 marble. In total, we have formed 3 groups.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many groups of 5 can be made from 10 marbles and 15 dims. We know that each group should have exactly 5 marbles and at least one dim in it. So, let's start counting!  🐰💡 Step 1: Counting the number of ways to choose 5 marbles out of 10.  We can use the formula for choosing objects without replacement: n! = (n - 1)! x n. Since we want to choose 5 marbles out of 10, we have: 5! = (10 - 1)! x 10 = 9! x 10 = 90. 🤔 Step 2: Now, we need to count the number of ways to choose 1 dim out of 15. We can use the same formula as before: 15! = (14 - 1)! x 15 = 14! x 15 = 180. 😮 Step 3: Finally, we multiply the two numbers together to get the total number of groups of 5 marbles with at least one dim: 90 x 180 = 16200. 🎉 So, there are 16200 possible groups of 5 marbles with at least one dim when selecting from 10 marbles and 15 dims.
Response:  If Rebecca has 11 friends in her group and each friend has two dogs, then how many dogs are there in total?  We can start by finding out how many dogs Rebecca has. Since she has 11 friends and each friend has two dogs, we know that Rebecca has 11 x 2 = 22 dogs.  So, there are 22 dogs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebeka has 4 groups of friends and each group consists of 6 people. So, in total, she has 4 x 6 = 24 friends. Now, let's see how many dims (or marbles) she needs for each group. Since there are 6 people in each group, she needs 6 dims for each group. Therefore, the total number of dims required is 24 x 6 = 144.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 dims in total. She wants to divide them into 3 groups. So, we can start by dividing the marbles into 3 equal parts. Since there are 4 marbles, each group will have 4/3 = 1 2/3 marbles. Now, let's move on to the dims. We can also divide the dims into 3 equal parts. Each group will have 15/3 = 5 dims. Therefore, the first group will have 1 2/3 + 5 = 6 2/3 dims, the second group will have 1 2/3 + 5 = 7 2/3 dims, and the third group will have 1 2/3 + 5 = 8 2/3 dims.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many groups of 6 can be formed from 18 objects (dimensions). We know that 18 / 6 = 3 with a remainder of 0, so there are 3 complete groups of 6. Now, let's see how many objects are left over after forming these groups. We have 18 - 3 x 6 = 18 - 18 = 0 objects left over. Therefore, there is no object left over. So, the total number of groups of 6 that can be formed from 18 dimensions is 3.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed using 99 candies, 9 dims, and 27 marbles. We can do this by calculating the number of ways to choose each item separately and then multiplying them together.  🎉 Here's the solution!  There are: 🔢 99 choices for the first candy 🍬 9 choices for the second dim 💎 27 choices for the third marble 🐳 So, in total, there are: 99 x 9 x 27 = 2683 groups possible! 😱 That's a lot of groups! Now, let's check if Rebecca has enough items to make 3 groups. She has: 📝 99 candies 👀 9 dims 🤩 27 marbles So, she has enough items to make: 99 x 3 = 297 groups! 🎉 Yay! Rebecca has enough items to make exactly 297 groups of 3 items each!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebeka has 20 dim and 6 marvels in total. Now, she wants to divide these into 5 equal parts for each of her friends. So, let's start with dividing the dim into 5 equal parts. We can do this by dividing 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4 Each friend will get 4 dims. Now, let's move on to the marvels. Since there are only 6 marvels, we can simply distribute them equally among the 5 friends as well: 6 / 5 = 1.2 (Since we cannot have a fraction of a marvel, we will round up to the nearest whole number) Each friend will get 1 marvel. Therefore, the final distribution of dims and marvels for each friend is: 4 dims and 1 marvel per friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 dims in total. Now, let's see how many more marbles she needs to have 20 in total. To do this, we can subtract the number of dims from the total number of objects (marbles + dims) as follows: Total number of objects = 5 + 12 = 17 Since Rebecca already has 12 dims, she needs 20 - 12 = 8 more marbles. Therefore, Rebecca needs 8 more marbles to have 20 in total.
Response: 154 is the total score of the game if each round is worth 11 points and there are 13 rounds in total (11 x 13 = 154). So, if Tinu scored 11 points in each round, he would have scored a total of 154 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ron has scored 46 points in the game so far. Now, to find out how many runs he needs to score to reach his century, we need to subtract his current score from 100. So, 100 - 46 =?   Therefore, Ron needs to score 54 more runs to reach his century.
Response:  If Tinu has 84 points and he scores equally against each opponent, then he will score 84/3 = 28 points per game.
Response: 157 - 146 = 11 points. So, if Rohan scores 11 points in one game, he will have 157 - 11 = 146 points in total.
Response: 1) If he scored 78 points in the quiz, then his total score would be 78 x 3 = 234 points. 2) Since he won three prizes, each prize will be 234/3 = 78 points. Therefore, he has won 78 points per round.

Response:  Emily has 11 friends and each friend gave her 28 chocolates as a gift. So, in total, Emily received  11 x 28 = 318 chocolates.
Response:  Firstly, Emily has 8 friends in total and each of her friends will give her $16 as a gift. So, she will receive a total amount of $8 \times 16 = $128 from all her friends. However, she needs to buy 16 gifts for her friends, so she will spend $128 on buying those gifts. Therefore, Emily will have $128 - $128 = $0 left after purchasing the gifts.
Response: 12 - 6 = 6. So, Emili has 6 manikants left after giving 6 to her friends.
Response:  Emily has 5 friends and each friend has given her $4 as a gift. So, Emily has received a total of 5 x $4 = $20 as gifts.
Response:  Firstly, Emily has 72 friends in total and she wants to divide them into groups of 3 or 6 people. So, we need to find out how many ways she can do this. To do this, we will use combinatorics.   There are two types of combinations here:  1) Choosing 3 friends from 72 (i.e., selecting 3 items from a set of 72).  2) Choosing 6 friends from 72 (i.e., selecting 6 items from a set of 72). We will calculate both these combinations separately.  1) Choosing 3 friends from 72:   To choose 3 friends from 72, we have to select 3 items from a set of 72. The number of ways to do this is given by the formula C(n, k), where n = 72 (the size of the set) and k = 3 (the number of items we want to select). C(n, k) represents the number of ways to select k items from a set of n objects, without replacement. Using this formula, we get: C(72, 3) = 2160 Now, let's check if our answer makes sense. If Emily divides her 72 friends into groups of 3, then she will have: 72 / 3 = 24 groups Of course, this makes perfect sense!  2) Choosing 6 friends from 72: Similarly, to choose 6 friends from 72, we have to select 6 items from a set of 72. The number of ways to do this is also given by the formula C(n, k), where n = 72 and k = 6. Using this formula, we get: C(72, 6) = 5040 Again, let's check if our answer makes sense. If Emily divides her 72 friends into groups of 6, then she will have: 72 / 6 = 12 groups This too makes perfect sense! Finally, we add up all the possible combinations to find out the total number of ways Emily can divide her 72 friends into groups of 3 or 6: Total = C(72, 3) +
Response: 1) There were 43 friends in total. 2) Each friend had to give 5 gifts and receive 20 gifts. So, the total number of gifts given out is:  43 x 5 = 215 gifts. Now, let's calculate how many gifts each friend received. Since there are 20 gifts for every gift given, each friend received:  215 / 20 = 1075 gifts.
Response:  Firstly, Emily has 44 friends and she has given away 26 gifts in total. So, the number of gifts left with her is:  44 - 26 = 18 Now, for each gift, there are two types of items (i.e., 2 x 18 = 36) that Emily needs to buy. Therefore, the total number of items Emily needs to purchase is:  36 x 2 = 72
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 819058 students in the camp. Secondly, we know that each student has brought 662784 items of luggage. So, to calculate the total number of items of luggage in the camp, we can multiply the number of students by the number of items each student has brought. Therefore, the total number of items of luggage in the camp is:  819058 x 662784 = 553522880. Now, let's convert this number into words. There are 553522880 items of luggage in the camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 202958 students in the camp and 776222 students in other schools. Now, we need to find out how many more students are in the camp than in other schools. To do this, we can subtract the number of students in other schools from the total number of students in the camp. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  202958 - 776222 = 573266. Therefore, there are 573266 more students in the camp than in other schools.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 898051 students in the school. Secondly, we know that 624244 students attend the camp. So, if we subtract the number of students attending the camp from the total number of students in the school, we can find out how many students remain in the school.  898051 - 624244 =?  The difference between these two numbers is 273767. Therefore, there are 273767 students remaining in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 313 students in the school. Of these, 274 students live in the hostel and the rest (39) commute from home. Now, we need to find out how many students attend the camp. We can do this by subtracting the number of commuters (39) from the total number of students (313). So, the number of students attending the camp is:  313 - 39 = 274.
Response:  We know that there are 907611 students in the countryside and 455824 students in the city. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  907611 + 455824 = 1363435 students. Therefore, there are approximately 1363435 students in the entire country.
Response:  We know that there are 800059 students in the countryside and 128276 students in the city. So, if we subtract the number of students in the city from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students - Number of students in the city = 800059 - 128276 = 671733. Therefore, approximately 671733 students live in rural areas.
Response:  We know that there were 61,676 students in the lorenz kontee (91,676 - 30,000 = 61,676). Of these, 30,000 students lived in the barracks, and the remaining 61,676 - 30,000 = 31,676 students lived outside the barracks. So, 31,676 students lived outside the barracks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34044 students in the camp and each student has brought 1-2 bags of rice. So, the total number of bags of rice is:  34044 x 1 = 34044 bags  or  34044 x 2 = 68088 bags Now, let's calculate the average weight of one bag of rice. We know that the weight of one bag of rice is 50 kg. So, the total weight of all the bags of rice is:  34044 x 50 kg = 1702200 kg (or 17022 tons) Therefore, the average weight of one bag of rice is:  1702200 kg / 34044 bags = 50 kg per bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 610796 people in the world who have learned to read and write. Now, if we subtract the number of children who attended school from this total, we get the number of illiterate adults in the world. To do this, we need to find out how many children attend school. According to the information given, there were 590796 students in the camp, which is not the entire population of learners. So, let's assume that the remaining 200000 people are also attending school. Therefore, the number of illiterate adults can be calculated as follows: Total number of literates - Number of children attending school = Number of illiterate adults 610796 - (590796 + 200000) = 410796 This means that there are approximately 41 million illiterate adults in the world.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 644977 people in the world in 1950. (Source: World Bank) Now, let's calculate the number of children who lived in camps at that time. We are given that 89385 children attended camp. So, to find out the percentage of children who lived in camps, we can divide 89385 by 644977 and multiply by 100.  Percentage of children who lived in camps = (89385/644977) x 100%  = 13.62%  Therefore, approximately 13.62% of children in the world lived in camps in 1950.
Response:  We know that Jack has 3 apples and Adam has 9 apples. So, if we combine their apples, we will have: 3 + 9 = 12 apples in total. Therefore, Jack has 40% of the total apples (12 x 40%).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 2 apples and Adam has 10 apples. So, if we add both their numbers of apples together, we get: 2 + 10 = 12 apples in total. Now, we need to find out how many more apples Adam has than Jack. To do this, we subtract the number of apples Jack has from the total number of apples: 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, Adam has 10 more apples than Jack.
Response:  Jack has 10 apples and Adam has 9 apples. We need to find out how many more apples Jack has than Adam. To do this, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jack has: 10 - 9 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 1. So, Jack has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie has 10 apples.  Secondly, Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Therefore, Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples. So, Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 14 apples.
Response:  We know that there are six apples in total and four of them belong to Adam. So, we can start by subtracting four from six: 6 - 4 = 2 Now, we need to find out how many apples Jack has. Since four apples belong to Adam, that means Jack has two apples: 2 Therefore, there are two apples left for Jack.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 7 appiles. So, together they have 9 + 7 = 16 apples. Therefore, there are 16 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 12 apples in total. Secondly, we know that Adam and Jack together have 9 apples more than Jack has. So, if we subtract Jack's apples from the total number of apples, we get: Total number of apples = 12 (Jack's apples) + (9 more than Jack's apples) = 12 + 9 = 21 apples. Now, we can see that Adam has 8 more apples than Jack, so Adam has: Adam's apples = Jack's apples + 8 = 21 + 8 = 29 apples. Therefore, there are 29 apples in total - 21 belonging to Adam and 8 belonging to Jack.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 10 apples and Adam has 4 apples. So, together they have 10 + 4 = 14 apples. Now, we are told that Adam and Jack have 6 apples together. Therefore, we can say that Adam has x apples (where x is a variable) and Jack has 10 - x apples. Since they have 6 apples together, we can set up the equation: x + (10 - x) = 6... 2 more lines...  Based on the above information, we can see that Adam has 3 apples and Jack has 7 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 5 apples in total. Secondly, he has 89 cherries and 11 apples. So, if we subtract the number of cherries from the total number of fruits, we get: Total fruit = 5 + 11 = 16 Now, let's divide the total number of fruits by the number of apples to find out how many apples Jack has: 16 / 5 = 3 Therefore, Jack has 3 apples.

2.5 x 12 (number of months) =? 

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of eggs laid by all the hens in one year. To do this, we multiply the number of eggs laid per day by the number of days in a year: 

365 (days in a year) x 2.5 (eggs per day) =? 

So, the total number of eggs laid by all the hens in one year is: 

365 x 2.5 =? 

Therefore, the answer is:  

365 x 2.5 = 912.5"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen had 197 chickens and 46 ducks in her backyard at one point in time. Now, she has only 75 chickens and 23 ducks. So, to find out how many fewer chickens and ducks she has now compared to before, we need to subtract the current number from the previous number.  For chickens:  197 - 75 = 122 (fewer)  For ducks:  46 - 23 = 23 (fewer)  Therefore, Helen has 122 fewer chickens and 23 fewer ducks now than she did before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen and her friends have prepared 300 chocolates and 519 cookies for the party.

"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner received $16000 from Fred and spent $4000 on his own work. So, the amount he spent on Fred's work is:  
$16000 - $4000 = $12000 Now, let's calculate how much Freed earned from Jessner. We know that Freed received $19000 from Jessner and spent $5000 on his own work. So, the amount he earned from Jessner is:  
$19000 - $5000 = $14000 Therefore, the total earnings of Freed are:  
$12000 + $14000 = $26000"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner paid $14 for 22 pounds of freight and Fred paid $22 for 11 pounds of freight. So, the cost per pound of freight is:   Cost per pound = (Total amount paid) / (Number of pounds)  For Jessner:  Cost per pound = $14 / 22 pounds = $0.64 per pound  For Fred:  Cost per pound = $22 / 11 pounds = $1.91 per pound Now, we need to find out how much Jessner and Fred paid in total for their respective shipments.  Total payment for Jessner = Number of pounds x Cost per pound  Total payment for Jessner = 22 pounds x $0.64 per pound = $14.08  Total payment for Fred = Number of pounds x Cost per pound  Total payment for Fred = 11 pounds x $1.91 per pound = $21.01 Therefore, Jessner paid $14.08 and Fred paid $21.01 for their respective shipments.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner had $40 in his account before he withdrew $111 from the ATM. So, after withdrawing $111, Jessner has $40 - $111 = $-71 left in his account. Now, let's consider Fred's situation. We know that Fred deposited $115 into his account and then withdrew $40 from the ATM. So, after withdrawing $40, Fred has $115 - $40 = $75 left in his account. Therefore, the difference between Jessner's current balance and Fred's current balance is: $-71 - $75 = $-146.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner had 3 dollars in his pocket at the beginning of the week and Fred had 49 dollars.  Next, we know that Jessner spent 12 dollars on groceries and Fred spent 63 dollars. So, after spending money, Jessner has 3 - 12 = 18 dollars left and Fred has 49 - 63 = 16 dollars left. Finally, we are asked to find out how much money Jessner and Fred have now. To do this, we need to add the amount they have left with them. Therefore, Jessner has 18 + 6 = 24 dollars and Fred has 16 + 4 = 20 dollars.  
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner had $31 dollars and Fred had $78 dollars.  Next, we know that Jessner spent $14 dollars on groceries and Fred spent $90 dollars on gas.  So, after spending money, Jessner has $31 - $14 = $17 left with him/her and Fred has $78 - $90 = $-12 left with him/her.   Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Jessner has and the amount of money Fred has is:  $17 - (-$12) = $29.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner received $95 from Fred in total. So, if we divide $95 by $33, we get:  95 / 33 = 2.85 Now, we need to round off this value to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the amount of money Jessner received from Fred is approximately $285. Next, we know that Jessner spent $16 on gas for her car. So, if we subtract $16 from $285, we get:  285 - 16 = 269 Finally, we can see that Jessner has $269 left after paying for gas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessner received 99 dollars from Fred and spent 47 dollars on gasoline for his car. So, the amount left with Jessner is:  99 - 47 = 52 dollars. Now, let's calculate how much Freed paid to Jessner. We know that Jessner gave 111 dollars to Freed. Therefore, the amount Freed paid to Jessner is:  111 - 52 = 59 dollars. Finally, we can find out how much Fred paid in total by adding the amount he paid to Jessner and the amount he spent on gasoline:  59 + 47 = 106 dollars. So, Fred paid a total of 106 dollars.
Response:  Jessi started with 71 kg and lost 20 kg. So she has remaining weight of 71 - 20 = 51 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie can lift 27 kilograms of weight. Now, if she has to lift 101 kilograms of weight, how many times more than her usual lifting capacity is this amount? To find out, we need to divide the new weight (101 kg) by her usual lifting capacity (27 kg): 101 kg / 27 kg = 3.78 times more So, Jessie needs to lift 3.78 times more weight than her usual lifting capacity, which is equal to 378 kg. Therefore, the answer is 378 kg.
Response:  Jessie started jogging regularly and lost 126 pounds in the first year. Now she weighs 66 kilograms. To find out how much weight she had before starting jogging, we can subtract her current weight from her previous weight. So, 126 pounds - 66 kilograms = 60 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie weighed 60 kilograms before starting jogging regularly.
Response: 1st step: Tinu lost 35 kg before starting her journey. So, she had 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg weight at the start of her journey.  2nd step: After losing 35 kg, Tinu has now (69 kg - 35 kg) = 34 kg weight.
Response:  Jessi gained 50 kg in the first week and then lost 60 kg in the second week. So, if we subtract the weight she lost from her total gain, we can find out how much weight she currently has. Total gain = 50 + 60 = 110 kg Weight lost = 60 kg Therefore, current weight = Total gain - Weight lost = 110 - 60 = 50 kg Jessi currently weighs 50 kg.
Response:  Jessie started jogging for 90 days and lost 62 kg in the first month and 140 kg in the second month. So, if we calculate the total weight loss of Jessie during those 90 days, it would be: Total weight loss = (62 + 140) kg = 202 kg.
Response:  Jessie weighed 94 kilograms at first and lost 56 kilograms in the first week. So, after the first week, she weighed 94 - 56 = 38 kilograms. In the second week, she lost another 43 kilograms, so her weight after two weeks would be: 38 - 43 = 25 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie lost a total of 56 + 43 = 99 kilograms in two weeks.
Response:  We know that there are 95 fish in total and 61 of them are big fish. So, we can find out how many small fish there are by subtracting 61 from 95. 95 - 61 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 34 small fish.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes and 97 snake eggs in total. If there were only 40 snake eggs, then the number of snakes would be:  93 - (40/2) = 93 - 20 = 73. So, there would be 73 snakes if there were only 40 snake eggs.
Response:  We know that there are 3 tigers and 75 alligators in total. If we have 82 alligators, then the number of tigers can be calculated as follows:   Tigers = (Total - Alligators) / 75   Tigers = (3 + 82) / 75   Tigers = 85 / 75   Tigers = 11   So, there are 11 tigers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 79 animals in total (79 = 24 + 51). Now, if 24 deer and 51 snakes are together, then the number of animals that are not deer or snakes is: 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4. So, there are 4 other animals besides deer and snakes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer had 171 tomatoes last week and he sold 30 tomatoes today. So, the number of tomatoes left with the farmer is:  171 - 30 = 141 Now, if the farmer sells 30 more tomatoes, there will be:  141 - 30 = 111 tomatoes left with him. Therefore, the answer is 111.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer had 160 tomatoes in total before he sold 56 of them. So, the number of tomatoes left with him is:  160 - 56 = 104 Now, if he sells 41 more tomatoes today, then the remaining number of tomatoes will be:  104 - 41 = 63 Therefore, there are 63 tomatoes left with the farmer after selling 41 more today.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer had 90 tomatoes in his bag yesterday. Now, he has given away 154 tomatoes to the market today. So, how many tomatoes does he have left now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes he gave away from the total number of tomatoes he had: Total tomatoes = 90 - 154 =?  Can you solve for the missing number and tell me the answer?
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 alus (alu is a type of vegetable). When he sold 172 tomatoes, he was left with how many tomatoes? To find out, we can subtract 172 from 175: 175 - 172 = 3 So, the farmer was left with 3 tomatoes after selling 172 tomatoes. Now, let's calculate how much alu he has left. We know that he had 77 alus before selling any tomatoes. So, if he sold 172 tomatoes and kept 3 tomatoes, then he must have sold all his alus. Therefore, the farmer has no alus left. In short, the farmer has 3 tomatoes and no alus left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 alus (alu is a type of vegetable). When he sold 53 tomatoes, he was left with how many tomatoes and alus? To find out, let's subtract the number of tomatoes he sold from the total number of tomatoes he had:  177 - 53 =?  Now, we need to find out how many alus he had after selling the tomatoes. We can do this by subtracting the number of tomatoes he sold from the total number of alus he had:  12 - 0 =?  So, the farmer has 123 tomatoes and 12 alus left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 105 tomatoes in total (71 red and 34 green). Now, if 137 tomatoes were taken out, how many tomatoes would be left behind? To find this, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes taken out from the total number of tomatoes. So, we can do: Total Tomatoes - Tomatoes Taken Out = Number of Tomato Left Behind 105 - 137 =?  Sure enough! We get: 105 - 137 = -32 There are 32 tomatoes left behind.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many planks of length 2 meters each are required for constructing a wall of length 8 meters using 4-inch wide planks. We know that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so 1 foot = 30.48 cm and 1 yard = 91.44 cm. Therefore, 1 4-inch wide plank is equal to 10.16 cm or 101.6 mm. Now, let's convert the length of the wall from meters to centimeters:  8 meters x (1 meter / 100 cm) = 800 cm To find out how many planks of length 2 meters each are required, we can divide the total length of the wall (in centimeters) by the length of one plank (in centimeters): 800 cm ÷ 101.6 cm/plank = 7.91 planks So, we need approximately 7.91 planks of length 2 meters each to construct a wall of length 8 meters using 4-inch wide planks. However, since we have been asked to round off our answer to the nearest whole number, we will round up to the next whole number, which is 8 planks. Therefore, the answer is: 8 planks of length 2 meters each are required to construct a wall of length 8 meters using 4-inch wide planks.
Response: 13 x 8 = 104 (13 x 7 = 91) + 24 (8 x 3 = 24). So, the total cost of 13 pieces of furniture is Tk. 104 + 24 = Tk. 128.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many planks of length 11 feet are required for constructing a wall of length 30 feet using 8-inch wide planks. We know that 11 feet = 11 x 12 inches = 132 inches So, we can calculate the number of planks as follows: Number of planks = Total length / Length of each plank = 30 feet / 132 inches = 2.307 planks Now, let's calculate the total cost of these planks. We know that the cost per linear foot is $1.50, so the total cost of one plank is: Cost per plank = $1.50 per linear foot x 132 inches = $192 per plank Therefore, the total cost of 2.307 planks will be: Total cost = Number of planks x Cost per plank = 2.307 x $192 = $436.64
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of big planks required for each room. To do this, we will divide the length of each wall by the width of one big plank (12 feet). Then, we will round up the result to the nearest whole number since we cannot have a fractional plank. For example, for Room 1, we have a wall length of 15 feet, so we will require 15/12 = 1 + 1 = 2 big planks. Similarly, for Room 2, we will require 20/12 = 2 + 1 = 3 big planks, and for Room 3, we will require 18/12 = 2 + 1 = 3 big planks. In total, we will need 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 big planks. Now, let's calculate the number of small planks required for each room. We know that we can use 10 small planks per big plank, so we will multiply the number of big planks required by 10. Therefore, for Room 1, we will require 8 x 10 = 80 small planks, for Room 2, we will require 8 x 10 = 80 small planks, and for Room 3, we will require 8 x 10 = 80 small planks. In total, we will need 80 + 80 + 80 = 240 small planks. So, the answer is 240 small planks and 8 big planks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many planks are required for each room (2 rooms). To do this, we divide the total area of each room by the size of one plank (16 square feet): Room 1: Area = 120 square feet / 16 square feet per plank = 7.5 planks Room 2: Area = 80 square feet / 16 square feet per plank = 5 planks Now, let's add up the number of planks required for both rooms: Total number of planks = 7.5 + 5 = 12.5 planks So, you will need 12.5 planks to cover the walls and ceiling of your two-room house.
Response: 1) Firstly, we need to calculate how many planks are required for each side of the house (length x width). 2) Then, we will calculate the total number of planks needed based on the length and width of the house. 3) Finally, we will divide the total number of planks by the number of planks that can be carried by one person to determine how many trips are required to transport all the planks.   Calculation: Length of the house = 8 meters Width of the house = 6 meters Number of planks required for each side = Length x Width = 8 x 6 = 48 planks Total number of planks required = Number of planks x 2 (for both sides) = 48 x 2 = 96 planks Number of planks that can be carried by one person = 74 (given in the problem) Total number of trips required = Total number of planks / Number of planks per trip = 96 / 74 = 13 trips Therefore, it would take 13 trips to transport all the planks to build the house.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of planks required for each type of wall (12 inches and 17 inches). For a 12-inch wide wall, we need 12 x 6 = 72 planks, and for a 17-inch wide wall, we need 17 x 6 = 102 planks. Now, let's calculate the total number of planks required for both types of walls. Total number of planks = 72 + 102 = 174 planks. So, the answer is 174 planks.
Response:  We know that there are three packets of gems in each packet, and there are a total of 42 packets. So, to find out how many gems are in Robina's box, we need to multiply the number of packets by the number of gems in each packet.  Therefore, the answer is:  3 x 3 = 9 (games in each packet) x 42 packets = 368 games in Robina's box.
Response:  We know that there are 43 packages in Rabin's cart. Each package contains 22 items. So, we can calculate the total number of items as follows: Total number of items = Number of packages x Number of items per package Total number of items = 43 x 22 Total number of items = 936 Therefore, there are 936 items in Rabin's cart.
Response:  We know that there are 7 packets of gam in Robi's bag and each packet contains 6 pieces of gam. So, the total number of pieces of gam in Robi's bag is 7 x 6 = 42. Now, we need to find out how many packets of gam are left with Robi after giving 6 packets to his friends. To do this, we subtract the number of packets given away (6) from the total number of packets in Robi's bag (7): 7 - 6 = 1. Therefore, there is one packet of gam left with Robi after giving 6 packets to his friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 packets of gammar in Robi's bag. Each packet contains 4 tuktors. So, to find out how many tuktors are in Robi's bag, we can multiply the number of packets by the number of tuktors in each packet. Therefore, the total number of tuktors in Robi's bag is:  28 packets x 4 tuktors per packet = 112 tuktors.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 packets of gammar and 45 packets of misti in Robiner's store. Secondly, each packet of gammar contains 9 tuktors. So, to find out how many tuktors of gammar are there in total, we can multiply 21 (packets) by 9 (tuktors per packet). That gives us: Total number of tuktors of gammar = 21 x 9 = 189 tuktors. Now, let's calculate the total number of mishti packets. We know that there are 45 packets of mishti. Since each packet contains 3 mixtures, we can calculate the total number of mixtures as follows: Total number of mixtures = 45 (packets) x 3 (mixtures per packet) = 135 mixtures. Therefore, the total number of tuktors of gammar and mixtures in Robiner's store is: Total number of tuktors = 189 + 135 = 324 tuktors.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 packets of gammar in Robi's bag. Each packet contains 6 tuktors. So, the total number of tuktors in Robi's bag is:  28 x 6 = 168 tuktors.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many minutes each shirt takes to make. We know that one shirt takes 30 minutes to make. So, if we want to make six shirts, it will take 6 x 30 = 180 minutes. Now, let's calculate how much time is required for all three tasks combined. We can do this by adding up the time required for each task: 180 + 120 + 90 = 490 minutes. Therefore, it will take approximately 490 minutes (or about 8.17 hours) to complete all three tasks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many shifts of 5 minutes each can be done in 4 hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour and 120 minutes in 2 hours. So, we can do: 4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes 240 minutes / 5 minutes per shift = 48 shifts Now, let's calculate how many products can be made in one shift of 5 minutes. We know that the worker can make 4 products in 5 minutes. So, we can do: 4 products/shift x 48 shifts = 192 products In total, the worker can make 192 products in 4 hours.
Response: 1) The craftsman can make 3 items per minute. 2) He has made 9 items so far. 3) To find out how many minutes he has worked, we need to divide the number of items he has made by the number of items he can make in one minute. So, 9 / 3 = 3 minutes. Therefore, the craftsman has worked for 3 minutes.
Response: 13 shirts were produced in one hour and 3 shirts are being made now. So, to calculate how many minutes it will take to make 8 shirts, we need to first find out how long it takes to make one shirt. To do this, let's divide the number of shirts produced in an hour (13) by the number of shirts currently being made (3). This gives us:  13 / 3 = 4  Now, we know that each shirt takes approximately 4 minutes to make. Therefore, to make 8 shirts, it will take approximately 8 x 4 = 32 minutes.
Response: 1) The craftsman has been working for 9 hours today and made 8 shirts. 2) He makes two shirts per minute. So, he has worked for (9 x 2 = ) 18 minutes today. Therefore, the number of shirts he has made today is 8.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 3 items per minute.  Now, if it produces 8 items in total, then it must have produced them over some time period. So let's calculate the time taken to produce those 8 items. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so: Time = Number of Items / Production Rate Time = 8 / 3 Time = 2 hours and 20 minutes (rounded off) Therefore, the machine has worked for approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes to produce 8 items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 6 units per minute. So, in 12 minutes (given time), it will produce 6 x 12 = 72 units. Now, if it produces 14 units today, then the total number of units produced so far is 72 + 14 = 86 units. Therefore, the machine has produced 86 units in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that yesterday (April 30th) there were 12 shifts of 8 hours each, totaling 96 hours of work.  Now, today is May 1st and there are 6 shifts of 8 hours each remaining to be worked. So, the total number of hours left to be worked today is:  6 x 8 = 48 hours. Therefore, the total number of shifts worked today (May 1st) will be:  96 + 48 = 144 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carnival's revenue for 5 days is $1650. To find out how much revenue it generates per day, we can divide the total revenue by the number of days. So, $1650 ÷ 5 = $330 per day. Therefore, Carnival generates $330 per day.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Rintu earns Tk. 420 per day as rent from his game center and he spends Tk. 22 on each milestone. So, in total, he spends Tk.  22 x 30 = 660 on milestones for 30 days. Now, let's calculate how much money Rintu has earned after deducting the amount spent on milestones. We can do this by subtracting the amount spent on milestones (Tk. 660) from the total amount earned (Tk. 420 x 30 = 12,600). Therefore, the net amount earned by Rintu is: 12,600 - 660 = 12,940.
Response:  Firstly, Melar rang tas khela pratham 44 din e 382 daler ay kar chil. This means that in the first 44 days, he earned Tk 382 from selling eggs. Now let's calculate how much he earned in total. Total earning = (10 x 382) + (1 x 374) Total earning = 3820 + 374 Total earning = 4194 So, Melar earned a total of Tk 4194 from selling eggs for 10 months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carnival spent $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the next 16 days. So, if we calculate the total amount spent by Carnival in 46 days, it will be: Total Amount = $120 + $66 = $186. Now, let's divide the total amount by the number of days to find out how much Carnival spent per day: Daily Spending = $186 / 46 = $4.05 per day. Therefore, Carnival spent $4.05 per day for the first 46 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carnival's reigning period was for 154 days (325 days - 171 days). Now, let's calculate how many dollars Carnival spent per day during its reigning period. We can do this by dividing the total amount of money it spent ($57 million) by the number of days it reigned (154 days): $57 million / 154 days = approximately $370,698 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lusi bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cakes. Now, let's calculate how many packets of each item she has in total. Total number of packs of cookies = 10 + 4 = 14 packets Total number of packs of cakes = 4 + 4 = 8 packets So, Lusi has 14 packets of cookies and 8 packets of cakes in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lusi bought four packs of cookies (4 x 20 = 80). Secondly, she bought two packets of chocolate chip muffins (2 x 16 = 32). Finally, she purchased sixteen packs of cake pops (16 x 5 = 80). Therefore, in total, Lusi bought 80 + 32 + 80 = 192 packs of groceries.
Response:  We know that Lusi has 4 packets of cookies. Each packet contains 5 cookies. So, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows: Total number of cookies = Number of packets x Number of cookies per packet Total number of cookies = 4 x 5 Total number of cookies = 20 Therefore, Lusi has 20 cookies in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Luisi bought two packs of cookies and 12 packs of chocolates. So, the total cost of the items she bought is: 2 x 50 = 100 + 12 x 40 = 480 = 580 taka. Now, we are given that there is 56 taka balance left after paying for all the items. Therefore, the amount Luisi paid for the items is: 580 - 56 = 524 taka.
Response: 12 people were in the first stop, and 4 people got off at the second stop. So, there are 12 - 4 = 8 people left in the bus. Therefore, there are 8 people in the bus now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 8 people lived in the first house and 12 people lived in the second house. So, if we add 8 + 12 = 20 people lived in both houses together. Now, we are told that 3 people went to the third house. Therefore, if we subtract 3 from 20, we get: 20 - 3 = 17 people living in the two houses after 3 people went to the third house. Finally, we want to find out how many people are left in the first house. To do this, we can divide 17 by 2 (since there are two houses): 17 ÷ 2 = 8.5 (round down to the nearest whole number) = 8 people are left in the first house.
Response:  Firstly, there were 4 people in the house initially. Now, if 13 more people have joined them, then the total number of people in the house would be:  4 + 13 = 17. So, there are now 17 people living in the house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 8 people can travel in a truck. So, if there were 11 people in the truck initially, then 3 more people can travel in it. Therefore, the number of people who can travel in the truck now is:  8 + 3 = 11.
Response:  We know that there were 22 participants in the program and a total of 676 people attended the event. To find out how many students participated in the program, we need to subtract the number of non-participants (i.e., the audience) from the total number of attendees. So, we can calculate as follows: Total Attendees - Participants = Non-Participants Number of Participants = Total Attendees - Non-Participants Therefore, we have: 676 - 22 = 654 Non-Participants So, there were 22 participants in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 participants in the program, including 72 students and 44 teachers. To find out how many people were present in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, 73 + 72 + 44 = 189. Therefore, there were 189 people present in the program.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 174 students in total, including both boys and girls. Secondly, we are told that 521 students passed the examination, which includes both boys and girls as well. Now, let's divide the number of passing students (521) by the total number of students (174), to find out the percentage of passing students. Percentage = (521/174) x 100% ≈ 300% So, approximately 300 students passed the examination among the total of 174 students.
Response:  We know that there were 61 students in total (61 + 177 = 238). Of those, 44 students stayed in hostels (44/238 x 100% = 18%). Therefore, 194 students did not stay in hostels (238 - 44 = 194).
Response: 1307 - 919 = 388 years.
Response: 1) The distance traveled by the car in 849 minutes is given as: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = (60 km/h) x (849 min) Distance = 5074 km 2) Now we need to find out how much time it will take for the goat to cover this distance at a speed of 17 km/h. We know that: Time = Distance / Speed Time = (5074 km) / (17 km/h) Time = 300 hours So, if the goat travels at a speed of 17 km/h, it will take 300 hours or approximately 12.5 days to cover the distance of 5074 km.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the car is 659 feet. Now, if we divide this distance by the speed of the car (762 feet per hour), we get:  659 feet / 762 feet/hour = 0.86 hours or approximately 53 minutes and 48 seconds. So, it will take approximately 53 minutes and 48 seconds for the car to travel from point A to point B.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 packets of puffed rice in the bag. Each packet contains 200g of puffed rice. So, to calculate how much puffed rice is left in each packet, we need to subtract the weight of the puffed rice that has been eaten from the total weight of each packet. We can do this by dividing the weight of the puffed rice that has been eaten (8 x 200g = 1600g) by the total weight of each packet (200g). This gives us:  1600g / 200g = 8 packets To find out how many packets of puffed rice have been eaten, we can divide the weight of the puffed rice that has been eaten by the weight of one packet: 1600g / 200g = 8 packets Therefore, 8 packets of puffed rice have been eaten.
Response: 15 - 7 = 8 (subtracting 7 from 15). So, there are 8 pieces of fish left.
Response:  There are 16 pieces of gold jewelry in total, and 7 of them have been sold. So, there are 9 pieces of gold jewelry left (16 - 7 = 9). Now, we need to find out how many of those 9 pieces are sona maz (golden ornaments) and how many are pondha (silver ornaments). We know that 3 pieces of golden ornaments were sold, so there are 6 pieces of golden ornaments left (9 - 3 = 6). Therefore, the number of sona maz is 6.
Response: 15 people ate 5 sona mas (brown rice) each, so they ate a total of 15 x 5 = 75 sona mas. But only 5 people got sick after eating the food, so the probability of getting sick is 5/75 = 1/15.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 apples in the basket and 43 apples were initially present. So, if we subtract the number of apples in the basket from the total number of apples, we get:  43 - 2 = 41  Therefore, 41 apples are not being used.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 58 apples in total. Secondly, 35 of them were eaten. So, to find out how many apples were not eaten, we can subtract 35 from 58. Therefore, the number of apples that were not eaten is:  58 - 35 = 23.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 40 apples in total. Of those, 54 were eaten and 39 remained. So, to find out how many apples were consumed, we can subtract the remaining apples from the total number of apples:  54 = 40 - 39 Now, let's convert this equation into a numerical answer:  54 = 21 (since 21 x 3 = 63, which is equal to 40 minus 39) Therefore, 21 apples were consumed.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many actions are possible with four shells. We can do this by using the formula for the number of ways to choose objects from a set, which is given by: n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) ×... × 1. Since there are four shells and each shell has three actions (up, down, or stay), we have: n! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. So, there are 24 possible actions with four shells. Now, let's calculate how many actions are possible with one shell. There are three actions possible with one shell: up, down, and stay. Therefore, the number of possible actions with one shell is: 3!. = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6. Finally, we can multiply the number of possible actions with one shell by the number of shells to get the total number of possible actions: Total Actions = 6 × 4 = 24. So, there are 24 possible actions with four shells and one shell each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 actions in total (given). Of these, 8 actions are performed by Adam (also given). So, the number of actions performed by others is: 10 - 8 = 2. Now, let's find out how many shells are left after each action. For every action performed by Adam, 1 shell is left behind (given). Therefore, the number of shells left after all actions are performed is: 2 x 1 = 2 shells. Finally, we need to find out how many shells Adam has at home. Since he performs 8 actions and leaves 1 shell behind each time, he has: 8 x 1 = 8 shells at home.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 actions in total (8 fixtures). Each action has 10 items (cabinets) attached to it. So, in total, there will be 8 x 10 = 80 items. Now, let's consider the shelves. There are 4 shelves in total, and each shelf can hold 20 items. Therefore, the total number of items that can be stored on the shelves is 4 x 20 = 80 items as well. In conclusion, the total number of items that can be stored in the house is 80 + 80 = 160 items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 544 pots in total. Secondly, each pot has 32 fulls of rice. So, to find out how many fulls of rice are there in total, we can multiply the number of pots by the number of fulls per pot. Therefore, the answer is:  544 x 32 = 17,968 fulls of rice.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 466 pages in total. Secondly, each page has 53 words on average (given). Finally, we need to find out how many full stops and commas are present in each page. To do this, we can use the formula: Total number of full stops + Total number of commas = Total number of punctuation marks. So, let's calculate the total number of punctuation marks for each page: Page 1: 53 words x 1 full stop per 3 words = 17 full stops Page 2: 53 words x 1 full stop per 3 words = 17 full stops Page 3: 53 words x 1 full stop per 3 words = 17 full stops And so on... Therefore, the total number of full stops in all 466 pages is: 466 pages x 17 full stops per page = 8,092 full stops Similarly, the total number of commas in all 466 pages is: 466 pages x 1 comma per 3 words = 14,000 commas In conclusion, there are 8,092 full stops and 14,000 commas in the entire text.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 141 patters in total. Each pattern has 71 full and 91 stickers. So, to find out the total number of stickers, we need to multiply the number of patterns by the number of stickers in each pattern. Total number of stickers = Number of patterns x Number of stickers in each pattern Total number of stickers = 141 x (71 + 91) Total number of stickers = 141 x 162 Total number of stickers = 23,522.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 400 pups in total. Now, if each pup has 3 tails, then the number of tails will be:  400 x 3 = 1200 tails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4502 skittles in total and each group has 154 skittles on average. So, if we divide 4502 by 154, we get:  There are 29 groups of skittles.   Therefore, the number of skittles in each group is:  29 x 154 = 4502
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of skittles in all groups. We know that there are 3941 skittles in total and each group has 495 skittles on average (as mentioned in the problem). So, the total number of skittles in all groups can be calculated as follows: Total number of skittles = Number of groups x Average number of skittles per group Total number of skittles = 4950 x 495 = 248,750 To find out how many skittles are left after distributing 495 skittles to each group, we need to subtract the total number of skittles distributed to each group from the total number of skittles. Therefore, the answer is: 248,750 - 495 = 248,255 Skittles left after distributing 495 skittles to each group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 896 students in total and they belong to 517 groups. Now, if each group has an average of 90 students (which is given in the problem), then the total number of students in each group can be calculated as follows: Total number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups Total number of students in each group = 896 / 517 Total number of students in each group = 172 So, the answer is 172.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 270 students in total and 5 students in each class. So, the number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students in each class  =  270 / 5  =  54 classes. Now, if there is one student in each class who has enrolled in only one subject, then the total number of subjects = Number of classes x Number of students in each class  =  54 x 1  =  54 subjects. However, since some students have enrolled in more than one subject, we need to calculate the average number of subjects per student. To do this, we can use the following formula: Average number of subjects per student = (Total number of subjects) / (Total number of students)  =  54 / 270  =  0.200 or 20% of the students have enrolled in more than one subject. Therefore, the maximum number of subjects = Total number of students + Average number of subjects per student - 1  =  270 + 20 - 1  =  289 subjects.
Response:  We know that there are 304 graduates and each has 75 students under them, so we can start by multiplying 304 x 75 to get the total number of students.  304 x 75 =?  Now, we need to add up all these numbers to find out the total number of students.  So, we have:  304 x 75 + 304 x 75 +... + 304 x 75 (75 times)  To make it easier, let's use exponents.  304^2 x 75 =?  Now, we can calculate this using our calculator or pen-paper.  304^2 x 75 = 10,928,000  Finally, we need to round off this number to get the approximate total number of students.  Rounding off 10,928,000 to the nearest million gives us approximately 11 million students.  Therefore, the answer is:  Approximately 11 million students.
