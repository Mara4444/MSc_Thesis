Response:  Julie has 18 children and she wants to divide them equally among her 10 friends. So, each friend will get 18/10 = 1.8 children. Now, let's see what happens if Julie dies before distributing all the children. In that case, the remaining children will be divided among Julie's 10 friends according to their share of 18/10 = 1.8 children per friend. Therefore, the final distribution is: 18 children / 10 friends = 1.8 children per friend + (10 - 1) * 1.8 children = 17.2 children per friend.;
Response:  Julie has 11 children and David has 12 children. So, if we add both their numbers together, we get 23 (11 + 12). Therefore, the number of children that David has is 23.;
Response:  Julie has 5 children and each of them has 3 siblings. Therefore, there are in total 5 x 3 = 15 children. So, the answer is 15.;
Response:  Julie has 14 children and each of them has 2 siblings. Therefore, Julie has 28 grandchildren. If she has 16 great-grandchildren, then each of her grandchildren has 1 great-grandchild. So, the number of grandchildren each of Julie's children has is 16/2 = 8.;
Response:  Juliana has 16 children and she wants to divide them equally among her 12 friends. So, each friend will get 4 children (16/12 = 4). Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  Juliana has 14 children and each of them has 8 siblings. Therefore, there are 14 x 8 = 112 siblings in total. So, the number of siblings that can fit in one room is 112 / 8 = 14.;
Response:  Julie has 17 children and she wants to divide them equally among her two sons, David and Tom. If we assume that each son gets an equal number of children, then David will get 15 children and Tom will get 3 children. Therefore, the answer is 15 + 3 = 18.;
Response:  Juliana has 15 children and Devi has 18 children. So, in total, they have 33 children (15 + 18 = 33). Now, let's find out how many boys and girls each of them has among their children.  Juliana has 10 boys and 5 girls among her 15 children (10/15 = 2/3 and 5/15 = 1/3). Therefore, she has 6 boys and 9 girls (2 x 6 = 12 and 9 x 5 = 45).  Similarly, Devi has 12 boys and 6 girls among her 18 children (12/18 = 2/3 and 6/18 = 1/3). Therefore, she has 8 boys and 12 girls (2 x 8 = 16 and 12 x 6 = 72).  In conclusion, Juliana has 6 boys and 9 girls among her 33 children, while Devi has 8 boys and 12 girls among her 33 children.;
Response:  Julie has 5 children and her husband is also a doctor. So, there are 9 doctors in total (Julie + Husband). Among them, 3 are women (Julie + Her mother + Sister-in-law), which means that there are 6 men doctors (Husband + Father + Brother + 4 Friends). Therefore, the number of doctors who have more than one child is 6.;
Response:  Julie has two children, and she wants to give them each $100 as a gift. So, the total amount of money that Julie will give is $200. Now, let's consider the age of the children. The first child is 14 years old, and the second child is 16 years old. Therefore, the total number of years that Julie will be able to provide for her children is 14 + 16 = 30 years.;
Response:  Julie has 9 children and each of them has 7 siblings, so there are 9 x 7 = 63 siblings in total. Since Puppy is older than Julie's children, he must be at least 96 years old. Therefore, the number of people who were alive when Puppy was born is 96 - 63 = 33.;
Response:  Julie has 14 children and Devi has 2 children. So, in total, they have 16 children. Now, let's calculate how many children each of them has after 8 years.  For Julie, she had 14 children initially, so after 8 years, she will have 14 + (8 x 14) = 14 + 112 = 126 children.  Similarly, for Devi, she had 2 children initially, so after 8 years, she will have 2 + (8 x 2) = 2 + 16 = 18 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julie and Devi have after 8 years is 126 - 18 = 108 children.;
Response:  Julie has 8 children and David has 11 children. So, in total, they have 8 + 11 = 19 children. Now, let's consider their ages. Julie's youngest child is 3 years old, and her oldest child is 10 years old. Therefore, the age range of Julie's children is 3 to 10 = 7 years. Similarly, David's youngest child is 5 years old, and his oldest child is 16 years old. Therefore, the age range of David's children is 5 to 16 = 11 years. Finally, we need to find out how many children are between 5 and 10 years old. From the given information, we know that there are 9 children whose age falls between 5 and 10 years old. Therefore, the answer is (11 - 7) = 4 children.;
Response:  Julie has 15 children and each of them has 2 siblings. So, in total, Julie has 30 children. Now, we are told that among these 30 children, there are 7 who have their birthday on Sunday. Therefore, the number of children who do not have their birthday on Sunday is 23 (30 - 7).;
Response:  Julie has 13 children and she wants to divide them equally among her 10 friends. So, each friend will get 3 children (13 / 10 = 3). Now, let's consider the remaining 3 children. Since there are 10 friends in total, each friend will get 3 children + 1 child (3 + 1 = 4) from Julie's remaining 3 children. Therefore, Julie's 4 children will be divided among her 10 friends as follows: Friend 1 gets 2 children from Julie's 3 children, Friend 2 gets 1 child from Julie's 3 children, and Friends 3-10 get no children from Julie since they already got 4 children each earlier. So, the final distribution of children is: Julie's 13 children - 3 children given to 10 friends = 7 children left with Julie.;
Response:  Julie has 7 children and each of them has 3 siblings. Therefore, there are 7 x 3 = 21 children in total. Now, we need to find out how many children Julie has altogether including her own children and their siblings. So, we add 7 (her own children) + 21 (their siblings) = 28 children. Hence, Julie has 28 children altogether.;
Response:  Julie is 12 years old and has 14 siblings. In total, she has 34 cousins. So, her youngest cousin is 34 - 12 = 22 years old.;
"Response:  Julie is 25 years old and has 19 children. She had her first child at the age of 18 and her last child at the age of 38. Therefore, the number of children she had between the ages of 18 and 38 is:

Number of Children = Age at which she had her first child - Age at which she had her last child + 1
= 18 - 38 + 1
= 17
Therefore, Julie had 17 children between the ages of 18 and 38.";
Response:  Julie has 5 children and each of them has 6 siblings. Therefore, there are 5 x 6 = 30 children in total. Now, we need to find out how many children Julie has after adding her own children to their siblings. So, the number of children Julie has is 30 + 5 = 35.;
Response:  Julie has 18 children and 4 of them are boys. So, there are 18 - 4 = 14 girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 4.;
Response:  Julie has 4 children and her husband has 6 children. So, in total they have 10 children. Now, let's find out how many children each of them has.  Julie has 4 children, so she has 4/2 = 2 children more than her husband. Therefore, Julie's children are 2 + 6 = 8 children.;
Response:  Babi has 25 saagles of rice and he gives 43 to his friend. So, after giving, how many saagles of rice does Babi have left?  Therefore, the answer is 18 (25 - 43 = 18).;
"Response: 
Papa has 28 sacks of sugar. He gave 42 sacks to his friend. Now he has 63 sacks left. So, Papa has 63 - 42 = 21 sacks of sugar remaining.";
"Response: 
Papa has 33 shirts and gives 4 to his friend. So, he has 33 - 4 = 29 shirts left.
Now, his friend has 4 + 14 = 18 shirts.
So, in total, there are 29 + 18 = 47 shirts.";
Response:  Babi has 38 sacks of rice and he gives 36 sacks to Pinnar. So, now Babi has 12 sacks of rice left (38 - 36 = 12). Now, Pinnar takes 16 sacks of rice from Babi, so now Babi has 0 sacks of rice left (12 - 16 = 0). Therefore, the remaining sacks of rice that Babi has after giving some to Pinnar are 0 sacks.;
"Response: 
Papa has 20 sugar canes and he gave 34 to his friend. So, Papa has 16 (20 - 34) sugar canes left. Now, his friend is 18 years old. So, the number of sugar canes that Papa will give to his friend in the future is 16 + 18 = 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.";
Response:  Babi has 21 saagles (cars) and he gave 5 of them to his friend. So, now Babi has 16 cars left. Then, Pinnarayan took 9 more cars from Babi, so now Babi has 7 cars left. Therefore, the number of cars that Pinnarayan took is 9.;
Response:  Babi has 22 sacks of rice and he gave 5 to Pinky. So, Babi has 17 sacks of rice left (22 - 5 = 17). Now, Pinky got 8 sacks of rice from Babi (5 + 3 = 8). Therefore, the number of sacks of rice that Pinky received is 8.;
Response:  Babi has 19 sugar packets and he gives 2 to his friend. So, Babi now has 17 sugar packets left (19 - 2 = 17). Now, if Babi gives another sugar packet to someone else, he will have 16 sugar packets left (17 - 1 = 16). Therefore, the number of sugar packets Babi has after giving away all 3 packets is 16.;
Response:  Babi has 32 sacks of rice and he wants to distribute them equally among 20 people. So, each person will get 1.6 sacks of rice (32 / 20 = 1.6). But Babi has already distributed some sacks of rice among other people before this question was asked, so he now has only 20 sacks of rice left. Therefore, the answer is 20.;
Response:  Babi has 17 sapphires and he gave 15 of them to Pinnar. So, Babi has 2 sapphires left. Now, if Babi gets additional 36 sapphires, he will have 38 sapphires in total (including the 2 he already had). Therefore, the number of sapphires that Pinnar got from Babi is 36 - 38 = -2 sapphires.;
Response:  Babi has 23 sugar packets and he wants to share them equally among 30 people. So, each person will get 1/23 of a sugar packet. Now, let's calculate how many sugar packets Babi will have left after sharing them with 30 people. We know that 1/23 of a sugar packet is equal to 36 grams (since there are 23 sugar packets in total). Therefore, Babi will have 36 grams x 30 = 1080 grams of sugar left after sharing them with 30 people.;

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 jacks in Jack's bag.  Now, out of these 5 jacks, 3 were taken by him and he gave 2 to his friends. So, the number of jacks left with Jack is 5 - 3 = 2.  Now, among these 2 jacks, one was given to each of his two friends, so the number of jacks left with Jack after giving them to his friends is 2 - 2 = 0. Therefore, the final answer is 0 jacks are left with Jack.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 3 balls in Ali's bag and 5 balls in Jack's bag. So, altogether we have 8 balls (3 + 5). Now, Ali gives 2 balls to Jack. So, now Ali has 3 balls left and Jack has 7 balls (5 + 2). Therefore, the number of balls that Ali has is 3 and the number of balls that Jack has is 7.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 2 balls in Alen's pocket and 4 balls in Jack's pocket initially. Then, Alen takes out 3 balls from his pocket and gives them to Jack. So, now there are 5 balls (2 + 3) in Jack's pocket. Therefore, the number of balls that Jack has after receiving the ones from Alen is 5.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 20 balls in total (10 red and 10 blue). Then, 6 red balls are taken out of the jar, leaving 4 red balls inside (since 6/10 = 0.6, which is less than 1). Now, 3 blue balls are removed from the bag, leaving 7 blue balls inside (since 3/10 = 0.3, which is less than 1). Therefore, the final number of balls left in the jar is 4 + 7 = 11 balls.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 5 balls in Ali's bag and 4 balls in Jack's bag. So, altogether we have 9 balls (5 + 4). Now, Ali has taken 3 balls from his bag and given them to Jack. So, now Ali has 5 - 3 = 2 balls left in his bag. Therefore, the number of balls that Ali has in his bag is 2.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 6 balls in Alen's hand and 2 balls in Jack's hand initially. Then, Jack takes 3 balls from Alen's hand. So, now there are 6 + 2 = 8 balls in total. Among them, 3 balls are with Jack, and 5 balls are with Alen. Therefore, the final distribution of balls is as follows: Alen has 5 balls, and Jack has 3 balls.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 6 balls in one jar and 3 balls in another jar. So, altogether we have 6 + 3 = 9 balls. Now, Jack takes 4 balls from the second jar and puts them back into the first jar. So, now there are 9 - 4 = 5 balls left in the first jar. Therefore, the number of balls that Jack has taken is 4.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 5 balls in Ali's bag and 6 balls in Jack's bag. So, altogether we have 11 balls (5 + 6). Now, out of these 11 balls, 3 balls are taken away by Jack from his bag. Therefore, the number of balls left with Ali is 8 (11 - 3).;
Response:  We know that Jagdeep has 3 palmfuls of rice and 20 paisas. So, he has a total of 3 x 16 = 48 palmfuls of rice. Now, we need to calculate how many paisas Jagdeep has after giving 5 jerry cans of oil to Ali. Since each jerry can contains 5 liters of oil, Ali will receive 5 x 5 = 25 liters of oil. Therefore, Ali will have 25 / 5 = 5 jerry cans of oil. As Ali already had 20 paisas before receiving the oil from Jagdeep, now he has a total of 5 + 20 = 25 paisas. So, the final amount of money that Jagdeep has is 48 - 25 = 23 palmfuls of rice.;
Response:  Firstly, Jaggu has 7 balls and gives 3 to Ali. So now Ali has 7 + 3 = 10 balls. Then, Jack takes 4 balls from Ali and gives them back to him. Now, Ali has 10 - 4 = 6 balls left with him. Therefore, the final number of balls that Ali has is 6.;
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then we can calculate how many balls are left for Jack after he takes 6 balls from Ali. So, let's first count the number of balls that Ali has:  Ali has 5 balls. Now, let's subtract the number of balls that Jack took from Ali:  Jack took 6 balls from Ali, so now Ali has 5 - 6 = -1 ball (negative because we subtracted more balls than Ali had). Therefore, Ali has no balls left after Jack took 6 balls from him.;
Response:  Firstly, Aalan gave 2 balls to Jegan. Then, Jegan took 3 more balls from Aalan. So, the total number of balls that Jegan has now is 3 + 2 = 5 balls. Therefore, the answer is 5.;
Response:  The first six months of Ryan's trip were in India for 6 months, and he spent $2000 during that time. Now, he is traveling to China for another 2 months, and he has $1500 left with him. So, in total, Ryan spent $3500 ($2000 + $1500) during his entire trip.;
Response:  The first six months are in English and the next seven months are in Tamil. So, the total number of months is 13 months (6 + 7). Now, let's calculate how many times each language is used in those 13 months:  In the first six months, the person speaks English for 6 months x 2 languages = 12 months. And in the next seven months, they speak Tamil for 7 months x 1 language = 7 months. Therefore, the total number of months that the person speaks each language is: 12 + 7 = 19 months.;
Response:  The person has been working for 3 years in Ryan International School and has taken 10 months of leave. So, the total number of months he/she has worked is 3 + 10 = 13 months. Now, we need to find out how many days he/she has worked during these 13 months. Since there are 30 days in each month, the total number of days worked is 13 x 30 = 390 days. Therefore, the person has worked for 390 days.;
Response:  If Ryan can speak English for 7 months without any mistakes and he has to learn 20 words per day, then in total he will learn 140 words (7 x 20) during his stay of 7 months. Now, let's calculate how many times he will use each word on average. Since there are 365 days in a year, if he uses each word once a day, then he will use all the 140 words exactly 405 times (140 / 365). So, out of the 140 words learned, he will use approximately 405 times.;
Response:  If Riyan can speak English for 5 minutes without any mistakes and he has to repeat each sentence twice, then in total he will have spoken for 10 minutes (5 x 2 = 10). Now, if he repeats each sentence thrice, it means he will have spoken for 30 minutes (10 x 3 = 30). So, the number of minutes Riyan took to learn English is 30 - 10 = 20 minutes.;
Response:  Ryan has been working for 6 months in India and earned $100 per month. He saved half of his earnings which is equal to $50 per month. Now he wants to know how much money he can save if he works for another 5 months. To find out, we need to calculate the total amount he can save during these 5 months. Total savings = Number of months x Monthly income x Percentage saved Total savings = 5 x $100 x 50% = $2500 So, Ryan can save $2500 if he works for another 5 months.;
Response:  The first six months are in English and the next five months are in Tamil. So, the total number of months is 11 months (6 + 5). Now, if he has two days off in those 11 months, then the remaining time will be 11 - 2 = 9 months. Therefore, the answer is 9 months.;
Response:  Ryan has been working for 5 months in an Anglo-Indian school and earned $100 per month. He saved $30 of it and spent $70 on various things. Now he wants to know how much money he will have after 6 months if he continues to work at the same rate. To calculate this, we need to consider both his savings and expenses. His total earnings for 6 months would be: $100 x 6 = $600 ( since he worked for 6 months) His savings for 6 months would be :$30 x 6 = $180 (since he saved $30 every month) So, his total amount after 6 months would be: $600 - $180 = $420 This means that after 6 months, Ryan will have $420 left with him.;
"Response:  The person has been working for 86 years and has earned $10 million in gold coins and $20 million in silver coins.  Therefore, the total amount of money he has earned is:

$10 million x 86 years = $860 million (gold coins)

$20 million x 86 years = $1720 million (silver coins)

Total amount of money earned = $860 million + $1720 million = $2580 million

So, the person has earned a total of $2580 million during his/her lifetime.";
Response:  The first part of the question is asking for the number of years that Ryan has been in India for 6 months or more. Based on the information provided earlier, Ryan arrived in India on January 15th, which means he has been in India for at least 6 months as of today (June 20th). Therefore, the answer to this part of the question is 6 months \* 2 = 12 months.  Now let's move on to the second part of the question. The question asks for the number of years that Ryan will have spent in India if he stays there for another 3 months after his current stay of 7 months. Again based on the information provided earlier, Ryan arrived in India on January 15th and has been there for 7 months as of June 20th. If he stays there for another 3 months, he will have stayed in India for a total of 10 months (7 + 3). So the answer to this part of the question is 10 months. Finally, we need to add up the answers from both parts of the question to get the total number of years that Ryan has spent in India. Therefore, the answer to the entire question is 12 months + 10 months = 22 months.;
Response:  The first part of the question is asking for the number of years that Rajinikanth has been in the film industry. According to the question, he started his career as an actor in 1975 and has been active in the industry for 47 years now (as of 2022). So, the answer to this part of the question is 47 years.  Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. It asks us to find out how many days Rajinikanth has worked in the film industry during these 47 years. To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of years by the number of days in a year (which is 365 days). So, if we divide 47 years by 365 days per year, we get approximately 1300 days. Therefore, the answer to the second part of the question is 1300 days.;
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""ரியான் 7 மணி நேரம் ஆங்கிலம் கற்க செலவிடுகிறார்"". This means that Ryans has spent 7 months in America and earned $1000 per month. Therefore, the total amount he earned in America is $7000 (7 x $1000).  Now comes the second part of the question ""சீன மொழியை கற்க மற்றும் 4 மணி நேரம் ஸ்பானிஷ் கற்க செலவிடுகிறார்"". This means that Sean has spent 4 months in Australia and earned $5000 per month. Therefore, the total amount he earned in Australia is $20,000 (4 x $5000).  Finally, we are asked to find out how much money both Ryan and Sean have earned altogether. To do this, we simply add the amounts they earned in each country: $7000 + $20,000 = $27,000. So, the answer to the question is $27,000.";
Response:  The first part of the question is asking for the number of years that Rajinikanth has been in the film industry. According to the question, he started his career as an actor in 1975 and has been active in the industry for 46 years now (as of 2023). Therefore, the answer to this part of the question is 46 years.  Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. It asks us to find out how many movies Rajinikanth has acted in during these 46 years. As per the information provided earlier, Rajinikanth has acted in around 168 films so far. So, the answer to this part of the question is also 168.  Finally, we are asked to calculate the total number of days that Rajinikanth has spent in the film industry. To do this, we need to multiply the number of years he has been in the industry by the number of days there are in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so multiplying 46 years by this number gives us 16,365 days (approximately).  Therefore, the answer to the last part of the question is 16,365 days.;
Response:  The man has 3 months of rice and 2 months of money left. If he spends 1 month of rice, he will have only 2 months of rice left. So, he can spend at most 1 month of rice. Now, let's calculate how much money he can spend in 1 month. He has 2 months of money left, so he can spend up to 2 x $50 = $100 in 1 month. Therefore, the man can spend at most $100 in 1 month.;
Response:  For 7 days, he can do either Angli or Tamil. So in one day, he can do either 1 Angli or 1 Tamil lesson. Since he has to complete 40 lessons in total, he needs to finish 40/7 = 5.71 (approximately) lessons per day. Therefore, he will need approximately 5 and a half lessons of Angli and 5 and a half lessons of Tamil every day.;
Response:  The girl has 8 pets and she sold 3 of them. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 pets left. On the next day, she bought 7 new fish. So, now she has 5 + 7 = 12 pets in total.;

Response:  The woman has 4 bags of diamonds and she wants to distribute them equally among her 3 friends. So, each friend will get 1 bag of diamonds. Now, let's assume that there are 6 bags of diamonds in total (including the ones already distributed). On the next day, if the woman gives 2 more bags of diamonds to her friends, then there will be 4 bags left with her (since she gave 2 bags away). Therefore, the final number of bags of diamonds with the woman is 4.;
Response:  The girl has 7 days in her monthly cycle and she gets her period for 3 days. So, there are 7 x 3 = 21 days when she doesn't get her period. Therefore, there are 21 - 8 = 13 days left in the month after she gets her period.;
Response:  The girl has 10 pairs of shoes and she wears them alternately for 3 days and then repeats the cycle for another 7 days. So, in total, she will wear each pair of shoes for 3 + 7 = 10 days. Therefore, the number of times she will repeat wearing each pair of shoes is 10.;
Response:  The girl has 8 days of period in total and she got her periods for 3 days each day. So, the number of days she had her periods is 8 x 3 = 24 days. Now, we need to find out how many days she didn't have her periods. Since she said that she didn't get her periods for 7 days after the last day of her periods, we can deduct those 7 days from the total number of days she had her periods. Therefore, the number of days she didn't have her periods is 24 - 7 = 17 days.;
Response:  The woman has 3 babies and each baby weighs around 3 kg. So, in total, she has given birth to 9 kg of babies (3 x 3 kg). Now, let's consider how much weight she lost during pregnancy. According to the question, she lost 10 kg during her last pregnancy, which means that she gained 20 kg (9 kg - 10 kg) during that time. Therefore, the total weight loss of the woman is 20 kg (9 kg + 10 kg).;
Response:  We have 17 apples and 16 pears. If we give one apple to each of the 16 pears, how many apples will be left with us? So, there will be 17 - (16 x 1) = 17 - 16 = 1 apple left with us after giving one apple to each of the 16 pears. Therefore, the answer is 1 apple.;
Response:  We have 5 cows and 11 buffaloes. If we want to divide them equally among 30 people, how many animals will each person get?  To find out, let's divide the total number of animals (5 + 11 = 16) by 30. So, each person will get 1/2 or  half an animal, which is equal to 8 animals in total. Therefore, the answer is 8.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 10 can be divided into 3 parts and also how many times 15 can be divided into 3 parts.  So, we need to divide both numbers by 3.  When we divide 10 by 3, we get 3. When we divide 15 by 3, we get 5. Now, we need to find out how many times 3 goes into 30 (which is the total number of pieces). When we divide 30 by 3, we get 10. Therefore, there are 10 pieces in each part, and there are 3 parts in total. So, the answer is 3 x 10 = 30 pieces.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 3 can divide 10 without leaving any remainder.  To do this, we need to perform division repeatedly until no remainder is left.  So, we start with dividing 10 by 3 and see if there is any remainder. If there is no remainder, then we stop; otherwise, we repeat the process.  In this case, when we divide 10 by 3, we get a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0. This means that 3 can divide 10 exactly once without leaving any remainder. Therefore, the answer is 1.";
Response:  We have 7 cows and each cow gives 15 liters of milk per day. So, in total, we get 7 x 15 = 105 liters of milk per day from all the cows. Now, there are 8 buffaloes and each buffalo consumes 30 liters of milk per day. So, in total, we need to produce 8 x 30 = 240 liters of milk per day to meet the demand of both cows and buffaloes. Therefore, the difference between the total production (105 liters) and the total consumption (240 liters) is 135 liters.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 7 can divide 71 and how many times 8 can divide 56.  Firstly, we know that 7 can divide 71 exactly 10 times (7 x 10 = 70). Now, let's see how many times 8 can divide 56. 8 can divide 56 exactly 7 times (8 x 7 = 56). So, the difference between the number of times 7 divides 71 and the number of times 8 divides 56 is 3 (70 - 56 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We have 2 சிவப்பு (Siivappu) and 6 மஞ்சள் (Mandram). So, we can make 3 pairs of Siivappu-Mandram. Now, each pair has 2 Siivappu and 1 Mandram, so there are 2 x 2 = 4 pairs in total. Finally, each pair has 14 Psachai (Pascha), so there are 4 x 14 = 56 Psachais in total. Therefore, the answer is 56.;
Response:  We have 19 cows and 11 calves. Each cow gives birth to one calf at a time, so we have 19 + 11 = 30 animals in total. Now, let's consider the age of each animal. A cow is born after 6 months, so there are 30 - 6 = 24 animals that are less than 6 months old (including both cows and calves). Therefore, the number of animals that are more than 6 months old is 30 - 24 = 6. So, among the 19 cows, 5 are pregnant (since they are over 6 months old), and among the 11 calves, none are pregnant since they are all less than 6 months old. Hence, the correct answer is 5.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cubes of size 3x3x3 are there in total and then divide it by 90 to get the number of cubes per minute. So, let's first calculate the total number of cubes of size 3x3x3.  There are 9 rows x 9 columns = 81 cubes of size 3x3x3 in each layer. Since we have 9 layers, the total number of cubes of size 3x3x3 is: 81 x 9 = 729 cubes. Now, we need to divide this number by 90 to get the number of cubes per minute. Therefore, the answer is: 729 / 90 = 8 cubes per minute.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 18 and 14 are divisible by each other.  So we need to divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 18 and 14 is 6. Now we can see that 18 / 6 = 3 and 14 / 6 = 2. Therefore, 18 and 14 are divisible by each other exactly 3 times. Similarly, we can check for 17 and 14. The GCD of 17 and 14 is also 6. So, 17 / 6 = 2 and 14 / 6 = 2. Therefore, 17 and 14 are divisible by each other exactly 2 times. Finally, we need to add the number of times they are divisible by each other. In this case, 3 + 2 = 5. So, the answer is 5.;
Response:  We have 5 சிவப்பு (cubes) and each cube has 14 மஞ்சள் (sides). So, in total we have 5 x 14 = 70 sides. Now, we need to find out how many cubes are there in 6 பச்சை (packets). Since each packet contains 3 cubes, we can conclude that there are 6 x 3 = 18 packets of cubes. Therefore, the number of cubes is 70 - 18 = 52.;
Response:  We have 65 boxes in total and each box contains either 7 or 3 items. So, there are 65 x 2 = 130 items in total. Since we know that each box contains at least one item of each type (7 types), so the number of each type is also known as follows:  Type 1: 7 + 3 = 10 items Type 2: 7 + 3 = 10 items Type 3: 7 + 3 = 10 items Type 4: 7 + 3 = 10 items Type 5: 7 + 3 = 10 items Type 6: 7 + 3 = 10 items Type 7: 7 + 3 = 10 items Therefore, the number of each type of item in the 65 boxes is:  Type 1: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) Type 2: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) Type 3: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) Type 4: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) Type 5: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) Type 6: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) Type 7: 10/65 = 0.154 boxes (or approximately 15-16 boxes) So, the answer to the question is: There are approximately 15-16 boxes containing each of the first 6 types of items and approximately 15-16 boxes containing each of the last 2 types of items.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 circles in total and each circle has 10 sectors and 18 divisions. So, we have to find out how many sectors and divisions are present in each circle. Now, let's assume that each sector contains 5 points (as per the given information). Therefore, the number of points in each sector is 5. Similarly, each division contains 3 points (as per the given information), so the number of points in each division is also 3. Now, since there are 10 sectors in each circle, the total number of points in each circle is 5 x 10 = 50 points. And, since there are 18 divisions in each circle, the total number of points in each circle is 50 + 3 x 18 = 96 points. So, the number of points in each circle is 96.;
Response:  We have 6 boxes and each box can hold either 16 or 18 items. So, in total we have 6 x (16 + 18) = 6 x 34 = 204 items. Therefore, there are 204 items inside all six boxes combined.;
Response:  We have 7 balls in total and each ball has 10 spots. So, there are 7 x 10 = 70 spots in total. Now, we need to find out how many spots are covered by two cups. Each cup can hold up to 5 spots, so if both cups are filled completely, they will cover 5 + 5 = 10 spots. Therefore, there are 70 - 10 = 60 spots left uncovered by the two cups.;
"Response:  We know that there are 5 different types of fruits - Apple, Orange, Mango, Banana and Watermelon. Each fruit has its own unique characteristics such as taste, color, shape etc. Now let's assume that each type of fruit represents one of the four numbers in the puzzle (0, 1, 2 or 3). So we have:  Apple = 0 Orange = 1 Mango = 2 Banana = 3 Watermelon = 4 Therefore, if we combine all these fruits together, we get: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 This means that among the five fruits, only one fruit is left out which is the Watermelon. So the answer to the riddle is ""Watermelon"".";
Response:  We have 36 balls in total (4 red, 4 blue, and 28 green). Each ball has a unique number from 1 to 36. Now, we need to find out how many numbers are repeated among all the balls. To do this, we can use the fact that each color group has an equal number of balls. So, if there are x red balls, then there are also x blue and x green balls. Moreover, since each ball has a unique number from 1 to 36, it means that each color group has at least one ball with each number from 1 to 36. Therefore, the number of repeated numbers is at most 36 / 4 = 9. Since there are only 9 colors, the answer must be 9.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 paisa in one rupee. So, if we have 13 silver coins and each coin has 4 paisa, then we have 52 paisa (13 x 4 = 52). Now, let's consider the remaining amount of money. If we have some other coins or notes, they will also contribute to the total amount of money. Therefore, the answer is 52 + X, where X represents the unknown amount of money that we don't know about.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 sweets in total and each sweet box contains 4 sweets. So, we have 19 x 4 = 76 sweets in all. Now, if 15 boxes are available, then the number of sweets left after distribution is 76 - 15 = 61 sweets. Therefore, the correct answer is 61.;
Response:  In each of the 10 boxes, there are either 4 or 6 sweets. If there are 4 sweets in a box, then there will be 4 x 10 = 40 sweets in total. If there are 6 sweets in a box, then there will be 6 x 10 = 60 sweets in total. So, there are 40 + 60 = 100 sweets in total.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times 6 can be divided into 60, and also how many times 2 can be divided into 100. So, we need to divide 6 by 60 and 2 by 100.  When we divide 6 by 60, we get 0.1 (since 6 x 60 = 360). Similarly, when we divide 2 by 100, we get 0.02 (since 2 x 100 = 200). Now, let's multiply these two numbers: 0.1 x 0.02 = 0.0002. Therefore, the answer is 0.0002.;
Response:  Jerry has 4 boxes of chocolates in his bag and he wants to share them equally among 8 friends. So, each friend will get 1/2 box of chocolate (4 / 8 = 0.5).;
Response:  Jerry has 7 marbles in his pocket initially. He loses 3 marbles while playing with his friends. So, he has 4 marbles left. Then, he finds 5 more marbles in the alley. Therefore, he now has 9 marbles (4 + 5) in total. Finally, he gives 2 marbles to his friend as a gift. So, he is left with 7 marbles again.;
Response:  Jerry has 4 cats and 22 dogs. Each cat has 6 puppies, and each dog has 5 kittens. How many animals does Jerry have in total? So, Jerry has 4 x 6 = 24 cats and 22 x 5 = 110 dogs in total.;
"Response:  Jerry has 5 urns and he can fill each urn with either 1 or 2 balls. He wants to distribute these balls among his 3 friends in such a way that each friend gets an equal number of balls. So, if there are x balls in total, then each friend will get x/3 balls. Now, let's find out how many different ways Jerry can distribute these balls among his friends:

There are 9 possible combinations of filling the 5 urns (since we have 5 urns and each urn can hold either 1 or 2 balls). For each combination, we need to count the number of ways Jerry can distribute the balls among his friends. We do this by using the formula:

Number of ways = Number of balls / Total number of urns

So, for the first combination (all 5 urns filled with 1 ball), there is only one way to distribute the 5 balls among Jerry's 3 friends:

Jerry can give 1 ball to each of his 3 friends, so there is only one way to distribute the 5 balls. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls for this combination is 1.

For the second combination (4 urns filled with 1 ball and 1 urn filled with 2 balls), there are 3 ways to distribute the 8 balls among Jerry's 3 friends:

1. Jerry can give 2 balls to each of his 3 friends, leaving him with 6 balls left over. There is only one way to distribute these 6 balls among his friends.
2. Jerry can give 3 balls to each of his 2 friends, leaving him with no balls left over. There is only one way to distribute the 6 balls among his friends.
3. Jerry can give 4 balls to each of his 2 friends, leaving him with no balls left over. There is only one way to distribute the 6 balls among his friends.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for this combination is 3.

We can continue this process for all 9 possible combinations of filling the urns, and we get the following results:

Combination 1: 1 way to distribute the balls
Combination 2";
Response:  Jerry has 20 marbles in his pocket initially. He gives 5 marbles to Tom and takes 3 marbles from him as a gift. Now, Jerry has 18 marbles left in his pocket. Then, he meets Alex and gives him 2 marbles as a present. So, Jerry now has 16 marbles left in his pocket. Finally, he meets Sam and gives him 1 marble as a gift. Therefore, the number of marbles Jerry has after meeting all three people is 15 (16 - 1).;
Response:  Jerry has 8 pets in his house and he wants to give them away for adoption. He already gave 3 dogs and 5 cats to different people. So, there are 8 - 3 = 5 dogs and 8 - 5 = 3 cats left with him. Now, Jerry is giving these 5 dogs and 3 cats for adoption. Therefore, the number of animals that Jerry gave for adoption is 5 + 3 = 8.;
Response:  Jerry has 7 friends and each friend has 2 pets. So, in total, Jerry has 7 x 2 = 14 pets. But then, one of his friends gives him 4 more dogs as a gift. Now, Jerry has 14 + 4 = 18 dogs. Therefore, the correct answer is 18.;
Response:  Jerry has 5 friends and each friend has 2 pets. So, in total, Jerry has 5 x 2 = 10 pets. But then, one of his friends gives him 3 more dogs as a gift. Now, Jerry has 10 + 3 = 13 dogs. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.;
Response:  Jerry had 8 balls in his pocket initially. He gave 4 of them to Tom and took back 2 from him. So, Jerry now has 6 balls (8 - 4 + 2). Then, he gave another ball to Sarah and took back 1 from her. So, Jerry now has 5 balls (6 - 1 = 5). Therefore, the number of balls Jerry had in his pocket after giving some to Tom and taking some back is 5.;
Response:  Jerry has 3 apples in his bag and he gives one apple to each of his three friends. So, now Jerry has 3 - 3 = 0 apples left in his bag. Now, if Jerry wants to give some more apples to his friend who came late, then he can only give him 1 apple as he already gave 3 apples to his other 3 friends. Therefore, the total number of apples that Jerry can give to his late friend is 1.;
Response:  Jerry has 7 options in his mind for the first move, and he chooses one of them. Now, there are only 6 options left for the second move, as one option is already used. Similarly, for each subsequent move, there will be fewer options available due to previous moves. Therefore, the number of options available for the last move (move 10) will be 5. So, the answer is 5.;
Response:  Jerry has 10 apples in his bag and he gives 2 of them to Tom. Now, Jerry has 8 apples left in his bag. Later, Jerry takes 3 more apples from the same bag and gives them to Sarah. So, now Jerry has 5 apples left in his bag. Finally, Jerry takes another 4 apples from the same bag and gives them to Rachel. Therefore, the final number of apples that Jerry has in his bag after giving some to Tom, Sarah, and Rachel is 5 + 3 = 8 apples.;
Response:  Jerry has 9 marbles in his pocket initially. He gives 3 marbles to Tom and takes 4 marbles from him. So, Jerry now has 9 - 3 + 4 = 6 marbles left with him. Now, he meets David and gives him 2 marbles. So, Jerry now has 6 - 2 = 4 marbles left with him. Then, he meets Emily and gives her 1 marble. So, Jerry now has 4 - 1 = 3 marbles left with him. Finally, he meets Sarah and gives her 2 marbles. So, Jerry now has 3 - 2 = 1 marble left with him. Therefore, the number of marbles Jerry has at the end is 1.;
Response:  Jerry has three apples in his bag and gives two of them to Tom. Now, Jerry has one apple left in his bag.  Tom has three apples (the ones Jerry gave him) plus four more apples he already had, so Tom has seven apples in total.  Therefore, the number of apples Tom has is 7.;
Response:  Jerry has 7 balls and he gives 2 of them to his friend. So, Jerry now has 5 balls left (7 - 2 = 5). Now, Jerry's friend takes one ball from Jerry and gives it back to him after playing with it. So, Jerry now has 4 balls left (5 - 1 = 4). Finally, Jerry's friend takes another ball from Jerry and keeps it as his own. So, Jerry now has 3 balls left (4 - 1 = 3). Therefore, the number of balls that Jerry has left is 3.;
Response:  We know that there are 2 types of birds - big and small. Among the big birds, 3 have wings, and among the small birds, 4 do not have wings. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds without wings. Therefore, out of the remaining 5 birds, only 1 has wings.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 birds in total and they can fly at most 3 times per minute. So, the maximum number of flights (or movements) we can observe is 12 (4 x 3). Now, let's assume that each flight takes exactly 10 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken for all flights is 12 x 10 = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can divide the total time by 60 to get the average time between two consecutive flights, which is 120/60 = 2 seconds.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 big cats and 46 small animals in the forest. If we assume that each big cat eats 3 small animals, then... (1) Big Cats = 4 x 3 = 12 Small Animals = 46 / 3 = 15 So, there are 12 big cats and 15 small animals left in the forest after they eat each other.;
Response:  We have 3 big boxes and 2 small boxes. Each big box can hold 5 small boxes, so we can fit 15 small boxes inside them. Therefore, the total number of small boxes that can be placed in all the boxes is 15 x 2 = 30.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 babies. So, we have to find out how many pairs of birds and babies are present in total.  There is one bird for each baby, so the number of pairs of birds and babies is equal to the number of babies. Therefore, the answer is 4 pairs of birds and babies.;
Response:  We have 2 big boxes and 6 small boxes. If we take out 3 small boxes from one of the big boxes, how many small boxes will be left in that box? The answer is 3. So, the number of small boxes left in that box after taking out 3 is 3. Similarly, if we take out 3 small boxes from another big box, there are initially 3 small boxes in it. After taking out 3, the number of small boxes left in that box is also 3. Therefore, the total number of small boxes left after both big boxes are considered is 3 x 2 = 6.;
Response:  We have 4 pairs of socks and 6 gloves. So, we can make 4 x 2 = 8 combinations. But, as per the given information, each pair of socks has to be worn with a different color of glove. So, out of these 8 combinations, only 3 are possible: (Sock1, Glove1), (Sock2, Glove2), and (Sock3, Glove3). Therefore, there are 3 unique combinations.;
Response:  We have 3 pairs of socks and 4 gloves. So, we can wear one pair of socks with each hand (since hands don't need socks). Therefore, the total number of items worn on the hands is 4. Now, let's count how many items are left for the feet. Since there are 3 pairs of socks, we can wear one pair per foot. So, the total number of socks worn on the feet is also 3. Therefore, the final answer is 7 (3 + 4).;
"Response:  We know that there are 6 birds and 3 eggs in total. So, each bird must have laid at least one egg. Therefore, we can conclude that there are 6 birds who laid eggs = 6 x 1 = 6 eggs. Now, let's consider the number of eggs laid by each bird. Since there are 3 eggs in total, each bird must have laid at most 3 eggs. Therefore, we can conclude that each bird laid exactly 3 eggs = 6 eggs / 3 = 2 eggs per bird. So, there are 2 birds who laid 2 eggs each = 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. Finally, since there are no remaining eggs after counting the eggs laid by all birds, we can conclude that the remaining 2 birds did not lay any eggs = 0 eggs. Hence, the answer is: Number of birds who laid eggs = 6; Number of eggs laid per bird = 2; Total number of eggs laid = 6 x 2 = 12 eggs.";
Response:  We have 4 crows and 3 dogs. The crows are eating rice. So, there is no food left for the dogs. Therefore, the answer is 0.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 balls in total and out of them, 4 balls were white and 2 balls were red. So, the number of white balls is 4/6 = 2/3. Therefore, the number of white balls is 2/3.;
Response:  We know that there are two types of birds - storks and others (not storks). So, among the birds that are not storks, there will be some who have laid eggs in the nest. Therefore, the number of birds that have laid eggs in the nest is equal to the number of birds that are not storks. Now, we are told that there are five such birds. So, the number of birds that have laid eggs in the nest is 5.;
Response:  We know that there are three dogs and they have to be taken out for walks. The owner of the house has gone out for work and will return after some time. So, we need to find a way to take care of the dogs until their owner returns. One possible solution is to keep them in the backyard until their owner comes back. However, this may not be feasible as it could get too hot or cold outside depending on the weather conditions. Another option is to leave them inside the house but make sure they don't bark excessively or cause any disturbance to neighbors. This way, they can still enjoy their freedom within limits set by their owner. Ultimately, finding an appropriate balance between keeping them safe and happy while also respecting their owner's wishes is crucial.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 birds and 3 babies in total. So, we have 5 - 3 = 2 more birds than babies. Therefore, the number of baby storks is 3. Now, let's count the remaining birds. There are 4 birds left after the babies are born, so the number of adult storks is 4. Thus, the final answer is 3 + 4 = 7 storks.;
Response:  We have 6 balls and we take out 2 of them without telling us which ones they are. Then, there are 3 remaining balls that we can see. So, the probability of each ball being one of the 2 hidden balls is $\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of any particular ball being one of the hidden balls is $\frac{1}{3}$. Hence, the answer is $ \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} $.;
Response:  We know that there are three types of people in this world - those who are always late, those who are always early, and those who are never late or early. Now, let's consider each type of person separately:  Type 1 (Always Late): These people will have to travel for 2 hours to reach their destination, which means they will arrive at 4 pm.  Type 2 (Always Early): These people will have to travel for 2 hours to reach their destination, which means they will arrive at 2 pm.  Type 3 (Never Late or Early): These people will have to travel for 2 hours to reach their destination, which means they will arrive at 3 pm. So, the average time taken to reach the destination is 3 pm.;
Response:  The first set of 20 cards has 48 cards in total, and each card has 5 numbers (1 to 5) printed on it. So, there are 48 x 5 = 240 numbers in total. Now, we need to find out how many numbers are left after removing 11 cards from the first set. Therefore, the number of remaining numbers is 240 - 11 = 229.;
Response:  The first set of 25 balls has 37 red and 1 blue ball.  If we take away one blue ball from this set, there will be 36 red balls left (since each set contains 36 balls). Therefore, the second set of 55 balls will contain 80 red balls and 1 blue ball. So, the difference between the two sets is 44 red balls (80 - 36 = 44).;
Response:  We know that there are two sets of numbers in the puzzle - 60 and 93. If we add these two sets together, we get 153. So, there are 153 pairs of numbers in the second set. Therefore, the number of pairs of numbers in the first set is 60 / 153 = 4.;
Response:  We know that in one of the boxes, there are 2 red balls and 36 blue balls. So, the total number of balls in this box is 36 + 2 = 38. Now, we have to find out how many red balls are in the other box. Since there are 36 blue balls in this box, and each box has an equal number of red and blue balls, the number of red balls in this box is also 36 / 2 = 18. Therefore, the total number of red balls in both boxes is 2 (from the first box) + 18 (from the second box) = 20 red balls.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three boxes in total.  The first box contains 66 balls of which 35 are red and 31 are blue.  The second box contains 35 balls of which 24 are red and 11 are blue.  Finally, the third box contains 24 balls of which all are blue. So, the number of blue balls in each box is as follows: Box 1 - 24 (all) + 31 (red) = 55 Box 2 - 11 (blue) + 35 (red) = 46 Box 3 - 0 (none) + 24 (blue) = 24 Therefore, the number of blue balls in the total of 90 balls is 24.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three boxes A, B and C. Box A contains 91 balls, of which 23 are red and 68 are blue. Box B contains 25 balls, all of them red. And box C contains 23 balls, all of them blue. Now, let's find out how many red balls are in total. We can do this by adding the number of red balls in each box:  Number of red balls = Number of red balls in box A + Number of red balls in box B + Number of red balls in box C  Number of red balls in box A = 23 Number of red balls in box B = 0 (since all balls in box B are red) Number of red balls in box C = 0 (since all balls in box C are blue) Therefore, the total number of red balls is: Number of red balls = 23 + 0 + 0 = 23 So, there are 23 red balls in total.;
Response:  Firstly, there are three boxes in total.  The first box contains 35 balls, and among them, 18 balls are red. So, the number of red balls in the first box is 18/3 = 6.  Now, let's consider the second box. There are 18 balls in this box, but none of them are red since all the red balls were already taken from the first box. Therefore, the number of red balls in the second box is zero (0). Finally, we have the third box with 3 balls. Since each ball can be either red or blue, the number of red balls in this box is also 1/3 = 1.  Hence, the final answer is 6 + 0 + 1 = 7 red balls in total.;
Response:  Firstly, there are three boxes A, B and C. Box A contains 53 red balls, box B contains 75 blue balls, and box C contains 21 green balls. Now we want to know how many balls of each color are in total. So, let's add up the number of balls of each color from all the boxes:  Red + Blue + Green = 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 balls. Therefore, there are 149 balls in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in January and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in January is: 31 x 24 = 724 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours are left after subtracting the number of hours spent by the dog from the total number of hours in January. The dog spends 61 minutes per hour, so it spends a total of: 61 x 24 = 1456 minutes in January. Therefore, the remaining hours in January are: 724 - 1456 = -732 hours.;
Response:  We have 23 boxes in total and each box contains 2 apples. So, we have 2 x 23 = 46 apples altogether. Now, out of these 46 apples, 10 are red apples. So, the number of green apples is 46 - 10 = 36.;
Response:  We know that there are 81 boxes in total and 2 big boxes among them. So, the number of small boxes is 81 - 2 = 79. Now, we need to find out how many small boxes have 68 items or more. To do this, we can divide the total number of small boxes (79) by 68, which gives us approximately 1.15 boxes per item with 68 or more items. Therefore, there are approximately 1.15 x 79 = 88 small boxes with 68 items or more.;
Response:  We know that there are 62 minutes in an hour and 39 minutes in a day. So, if it is 10 AM, then it will be 10 x 60 = 600 minutes past midnight.

Now, we need to find out how many green apples are left after taking away the two red apples. There are 27 green apples in the bag, so the number of green apples left after taking away the two red apples is 27 - 2 = 25. Therefore, the total number of apples in Reshma's bag is 3 (red) + 25 (green) = 28 apples.;
Response:  The given information is as follows:  Resham has 7 apples in his bag and he gives one apple to each of his friends. So, after giving an apple to each friend, how many apples will be left with him?  There are 6 friends. Therefore, the number of apples left with Resham = Number of apples he had initially - Number of apples he gave away = 7 - (7 x 6) = 0 apples.  Hence, there are no apples left with Resham.;
Response:  Reshma has 2 apples in her bag initially. She gives 1 apple to her friend. So, now she has 2 - 1 = 1 apple left in her bag. Then, she gets 3 new apples from somewhere. So, now she has 1 + 3 = 4 apples in her bag. Finally, she shares 2 of those apples with her brother, so now she has 4 - 2 = 2 apples left in her bag. Therefore, there are 2 apples left in Reshma's bag at the end.;
Response:  The number of apples in Reshma's bag is 52. In each apple, there are 7 seeds. So, the total number of seeds in all the apples in Reshma's bag is 52 x 7 = 364 seeds. Therefore, there are 364 seeds in Reshma's bag.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 types of marbles in Reshma's collection - red, blue and green. Each type has 8 marbles in total. So, the total number of marbles in Reshma's collection is 3 x 8 = 24 marbles. Now, we need to find out how many different colors of marbles are present in Reshma's collection. Since each color has 8 marbles, the total number of different colors of marbles is 3 (red, blue, and green). Therefore, the answer is 24 marbles / 3 colors = 8 marbles per color.;
Response:  The number of Reshma's friends who are not in her friend list is 16 (as given in the question). Now, we need to find out how many of them have liked at least one of Reshma's posts. To do this, we can use the following approach:  We know that there are 29 people in total in Reshma's friend list (as given in the question). So, if x is the number of people who have liked at least one of Reshma's posts, then we can write the equation:  Number of people who have liked at least one of Reshma's posts = Total number of people in Reshma's friend list - Number of people who are not in Reshma's friend list (i.e., 16)  Solving for x, we get:  Number of people who have liked at least one of Reshma's posts = 29 - 16 = 13 Therefore, 13 of Reshma's friends have liked at least one of her posts.;

Response:  We have 362 boys and 257 girls in a school. If we want to find out how many pairs of students can be formed such that both are from different classes (i.e., boy-boy or girl-girl pairs are not allowed), we need to subtract the number of same-class pairs from the total number of students. So, the number of pairs of students that can be formed is:  Number of pairs = Total number of students - Number of same-class pairs = 362 + 257 = 619 pairs Now, let's check whether there are any remaining students who cannot form a pair with anyone else. From the given information, we know that there are 403 students in total, including the 362 boys and 257 girls. Since each student can only form one pair, the remaining 403 - 619 = 214 students cannot form a pair with anyone else. Therefore, the answer is 214.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 employees in total and each employee gets $16 as salary. So, the total amount of money given to all employees is: Total Amount = Number of Employees x Salary per Employee Total Amount = 18 x $16 Total Amount = $272 Now we have to find out how much percentage of this amount goes to Edgar. To do this, we need to divide the amount given to Edgar by the total amount. Percentage = (Amount Given to Edgar) / (Total Amount) Percentage = ($50) / $272 Percentage = 18% Therefore, Edgar receives 18% of the total amount given to all employees.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 Dalits in the village and each of them has some work to do. So, the total number of works done by all the Dalits is 13 x 4 = 52 works. Now, we know that one person can do multiple works, so the total number of works done by one person is not equal to 52. Therefore, the average number of works done by one person is 52 / 13 = $3 per person$.;
Response:  The first person gave $ 9 to the second person and received $ 8 back. So, the difference is $ 1 ( $ 9 - $ 8 = $ 1). Now, the second person gives $ 17 to the third person. Therefore, the total amount of money that the third person has is $ 17 + $ 1 = $ 18.;
Response:  We know that there are 92 students in total and each student has to pay $ 16 for the trip. So, the total amount of money collected from all the students is : $ 16 x 92 = $ 1472. Now, we need to find out how much money Edvarth got after giving discount of $ 6 to each student. Therefore, the amount of money Edvarth got is : $ 1472 - ( $ 6 x 92) = $ 1306.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 different types of fruit juices and each costs $3. So, the total cost for all 6 juices is $3 x 6 = $18. Now, we have to find out how much money John has left after buying all these juices. Since he had $12 initially, he will have $12 - $18 = -$6 left. Therefore, none of the fruit juices cost $7.;
Response:  The cost of one pair of shoes is $6 and two pairs are needed for $16. So, the total cost of one pair of shoes is $6. Therefore, the total cost of three pairs of shoes would be $6 + $6 + $6 = $18. Since there are four people in total, each person will need $18 / 4 = $4.50 worth of shoes.;
Response:  The cost of each watch is $4 and $3 respectively. So, the total cost of both watches together would be $7 (4 + 3). Now, if John has spent $12, he must have bought 2 watches ($12 / $7 = 2). Therefore, there are 2 watches in total.;
Response:  The cost of one pair of shoes is $16 and another pair costs $8. So, in total, he has spent $24 ( $16 + $8). Therefore, he has $19 left after buying the two pairs of shoes.;
Response:  The father has $ 17 and gives $ 10 to his son. So, the father is left with $ 7. Now, we need to find out how much money the son gets from the father. Since the son gets $ 7 from the father, he now has $ 7 + $ 10 = $ 17. Therefore, the answer is $ 17.;
"Response: 
Zachary did 58 push-ups and Devid did 44 push-ups. So, the difference between their number of push-ups is: 
$$ \text{Difference} = \text{Zachary's total - Devid's total} $$
$$ \text{Difference} = 58 - 44 = 14 $$
Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Zachary and Devid is 14.";
Response:  We know that there are 51 boys and 44 girls in the class. So, if we want to find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. Therefore, the answer is: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary did 7 push-ups.;
Response:  Davis did 44 push-ups yesterday. Zachary did 9 more than Davis, so he did 53 push-ups (9 + 44 = 53).;
Response:  Davis did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 push-ups. So, the difference between their number of push-ups is 2 (51 - 49 = 2). Therefore, the answer to the question is 2.;
Response:  We know that there are 59 push-ups in total and 44 kick-ups. So, we have to find out how many push-ups each person did.  Since David did 19 push-ups, he did 1/3 of the total number of push-ups which is 59 / 3 = 19 push-ups. Similarly, Zachary did 27 kick-ups, so he did 1/2 of the total number of kick-ups which is 44 / 2 = 21 kick-ups. Therefore, the answer is 19 push-ups and 21 kick-ups.;
Response:  We know that there are 44 puffs and 17 kranses in each deck of cards. So, if we have 29 decks of cards, then the total number of puffs will be 44 x 29 = 1266, and the total number of kranses will be 17 x 29 = 453. Now, let's find out how many Zacharys are present in these cards. Since each deck has 13 Zacharys, so the total number of Zacharys in all 29 decks will be 13 x 29 = 357. Therefore, the answer is 1266 + 453 - 357 = 854.;
Response:  We know that there are 53 push-ups and 14 kicks performed in total.  Since David did 17 push-ups, he missed out on 36 push-ups (53 - 17 = 36). Similarly, since Zachary did 10 kicks, he missed out on 4 kicks (14 - 10 = 4). Therefore, the final answer is:  Push-ups: 36 Kicks: 4;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary can do 35 push-ups in one minute. Now, let's calculate how many push-ups he can do in 58 seconds. To do this, we need to divide the number of push-ups he can do in one minute (35) by the time taken to complete those push-ups (60). So, Zachary can do 35/60 = 0.58 push-ups per second. Since there are 58 seconds in 1 minute, Zachary can do 0.58 x 58 = 32.4 push-ups in 1 minute. Therefore, Zachary can do 32.4 push-ups in 58 seconds.;
Response:  According to the question, Zachary did 38 adductive push-ups and 62 abdominal crunches. Now, we need to find out how many push-ups he did more than 46. To do this, we subtract 46 from 38, which gives us 9. So, Zachary did 9 more push-ups than 46. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jim did 19 push-ups in 30 seconds. Now, let's calculate how many push-ups he did per second. To do this, we divide the number of push-ups (19) by the time taken to complete them (30 seconds). So, Jim did approximately 66 push-ups per second (19/30 = 66).  Next, we are told that David did 13 push-ups in 45 seconds. Again, we need to calculate how many push-ups he did per second. This time, we divide the number of push-ups (13) by the time taken to complete them (45 seconds). So, David did approximately 29 push-ups per second (13/45 = 29). Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Jim and David is 66 - 29 = 37 push-ups.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 51 people did push-ups in total. Of them, 22 Zachary did 30 push-ups. Now, let's find out how many push-ups John did. We are told that John did 4 times more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 30 push-ups, then John did (4 x 30) = 120 push-ups. Therefore, John did 120 push-ups.;
Response:  Jenny did 15 push-ups in 30 seconds. David did 39 push-ups in 45 seconds. John did 9 push-ups in 27 seconds. Now, let's find out how many push-ups John did compared to Zachary. We know that John took 27 seconds less than Zachary to do 9 push-ups. So, if Zachary took 45 seconds to do 39 push-ups, then John took (45 - 27) = 18 seconds to do 9 push-ups. Therefore, John did 9 push-ups in 18 seconds, which is equal to 5 push-ups per second.;
Response:  If Zachary did 30 push-ups yesterday and today he did 37 push-ups, then his progress is 37 - 30 = 7 push-ups per day. So, in 30 days, his total progress would be 7 x 30 = 210 push-ups.;
Response:  Davis did 56 push-ups in total. If he did 38 push-ups before his age was 38, then he did an additional 18 push-ups after his age became 38. So, the difference between their number of push-ups is 18. Therefore, Zachary did 18 more push-ups than Davis.;
Response:  If Zachary did 40 push-ups in 34 seconds, then he did 1 push-up every second.  Since there are 10 seconds in a minute, he did 4 push-ups per minute.  Now, if he did 62 crunches in 34 seconds, then he did 1 crunch every 0.58 seconds (since there are 100 crunches in a minute). So, he did 11 crunches in one minute. Therefore, the difference between his push-ups and crunches is 39 (40 - 11 = 39).;
Response:  If Zachary did 36 push-ups in 30 seconds and then took a break of 3 minutes (which is equal to 180 seconds), he would have rested for 180 - 30 = 150 seconds. Then, if he did another set of push-ups, it means he did 33 more push-ups in that remaining time of 150 seconds. So, the total number of push-ups Zachary did is: 36 + 33 = 69 push-ups.;
Response:  Zachary did 27 push-ups in 30 seconds and then took a break of 7 minutes. After that, he did another set of push-ups for 30 seconds and completed 5 push-ups during this time. Therefore, the total number of push-ups Zachary did is: 27 + 5 = 32 push-ups. Similarly, we can calculate the number of crunches as follows: Zachary did 17 crunches in 30 seconds before taking a break, and then he did another set of crunches for 30 seconds and completed 7 crunches during this time. So, the total number of crunches Zachary did is: 17 + 7 = 24 crunches.;
Response:  The girl has 5 bags of rice and wants to distribute them equally among 2 groups of people. Each group should get an equal amount of rice. So, we need to divide 5 bags of rice into 2 parts. There are 3 ways to do this: 1 bag per person (2 groups of 2 people each), 2 bags per person (1 group of 4 people), or 3 bags per person (1 group of 6 people). Now, let's count how many bags of rice each group will get in each case: Group 1: 2 bags of rice (if there are 2 people in the group) or 4 bags of rice (if there are 4 people in the group) Group 2: 3 bags of rice (if there are 6 people in the group) Total number of bags of rice distributed = Number of bags of rice given to Group 1 + Number of bags of rice given to Group 2 Therefore, the answer is 7 bags of rice (since there are 7 options for dividing 5 bags of rice between 2 groups of people).;
"Response:  We know that there are three types of clouds - cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. So, we have to choose one cloud type from each group. Now, let's see which cloud is suitable for each weather condition:

1. Sunny weather - Cumulus clouds are suitable for sunny weather as they are light and fluffy, providing shade and cooling breezes. Therefore, option A (cumulus) is the correct answer.
2. Rainy weather - Stratus clouds are suitable for rainy weather as they produce continuous rain or drizzle. Therefore, option B (stratus) is the correct answer.
3. Thunderstorm - Cirrus clouds are suitable for thunderstorms as they can indicate an approaching storm front. Therefore, option C (cirrus) is the correct answer.

So, the answer is: A-B-C";
Response:  If there are 5 types of vegetables in the fridge and each type has 3 bags, then the total number of bags of vegetables in the fridge is 5 x 3 = 15 bags.

Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 8 objects in a row such that each object is separated from its neighbor by at least one space.  There are 6! = 720 ways to arrange 6 objects in a row without any restrictions.  Since there are no restrictions here, we can apply this result to our problem. Therefore, there are 720 ways to arrange 8 objects in a row without any spaces between them. However, as per the given condition, we need to separate each object from its neighbor by at least one space. So, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where there are no spaces between adjacent objects.  To find this number, let's consider an arrangement where all the eight objects are placed next to each other with no spaces between them. In this case, there are only 1 way to arrange the objects. Now, let's count the number of arrangements where there are at least one space between adjacent objects. For example, if we place the first object farthest left and then place the second object next to it but not touching it, there are 7 ways to arrange the remaining six objects. Similarly, if we place the third object next to the second object but not touching it, there are 6 ways to arrange the remaining five objects. Continuing this process, we get a total of 7 x 6 = 42 ways to arrange the objects with at least one space between adjacent objects. Therefore, the final answer is:  Number of ways to arrange 8 objects in a row without any spaces between them = 720 - 42 = 678.;
Response:  If Reshma has 10 questions to ask her husband and she wants to know his opinion about each of them, then there are 3 options for him to choose from - Agree, Disagree, or Neutral. So, the number of possible answers he can give is 3^10 = 3000. Now, if we assume that Reshma wants to know her husband's opinion about all the 10 questions, then the total number of possible answers he can give is 3000 x 10 = 30,000. Therefore, the answer is 30,000.;

Next, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 10 pens on a table. This time, there are 4 ways to do it - pen1, pen2, pen3, pen4. So, the total number of ways to arrange these objects is 1 x 1 x 4 = 4. Therefore, the girl can arrange 4 different combinations of objects.;
Response:  The girl has 9 pairs of shoes and she wants to exchange 2 pairs for different sizes. So, she will have 7 pairs of shoes left (9 - 2 = 7). Now, each pair of shoes has 40% discount, so the price of each pair will be reduced by 40%. Therefore, the cost of each pair of shoes after discount will be 60% of the original price. Since there are 7 pairs of shoes in total, the total cost of all the shoes after discount will be 7 x 60% = 42%. Finally, the remaining 3 pairs of shoes will have no discount, so their prices will remain the same as before. Therefore, the total cost of all 9 pairs of shoes including the 3 without discount is 42 + 3 x original price = 45%.;
Response:  The girl has 11 pairs of shoes and she wants to distribute them equally among her 3 friends. So, each friend will get 4 pairs of shoes (11 / 3 = 4).

Therefore, the number of shoes that the girl is left with after distributing them equally among her 3 friends is 7.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are there in each class. From the given information, we can see that there are 7 classes with 11 students in each class, making it a total of 7 x 11 = 77 students. Now, let's consider the number of books required for each subject. According to the question, there are 8 subjects in all, and each student needs to read 5 books for each subject, making it a total of 8 x 5 = 40 books per student. Therefore, the total number of books required for all the students is 77 x 40 = 3080 books. So, the answer is 3080 books.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in both groups. The total number of students in Group A is 9 + 11 = 20 students. Similarly, the total number of students in Group B is 29 + 11 = 40 students. Now, let's find out how many students are common between both groups. We can do this by subtracting the number of students in each group from the total number of students in that group. So, the number of common students between Group A and Group B is: 20 - (9 + 11) = 6 students. Therefore, there are 6 students who are common between both groups.;
Response:  The girl has 8 bags of clothes and wants to distribute them equally among 7 friends. So each friend will get 1 bag.

Response:  Reshma has 2 pairs of shoes and 4 pairs of clothes. She wants to distribute them equally among her two children so that each child gets an equal number of items. Since there are 5 items in total (2 pairs of shoes + 4 pairs of clothes), each child will get 1 item from each pair of shoes and 2 items from each pair of clothes. Therefore, the distribution is as follows: Child A - 1 shoe + 2 clothes Child B - 1 shoe + 2 clothes Now let's count the number of items each child got: Child A got 1 shoe and 2 clothes, which means they have 3 items in total. Child B got 1 shoe and 2 clothes, which means they also have 3 items in total. So, the final answer is 3.;
Response:  The girl has 4 bags of rice and wants to distribute them equally among 7 friends. So, each friend will get 1 bag of rice. Now, she has 13 bags of rice left, which she can distribute among 19 people. Each person will get 0.65 bags of rice (13/2 = 6.5). Therefore, the answer is 0.65 bags of rice per person.;

Response:  We know that there are 4 types of jokes - 1) puns, 2) sarcasm, 3) irony and 4) wordplay. Now let's assume that each type of joke has a score of 1 to 5 based on its complexity and creativity. So, for example, a simple pun would get a score of 1, while a more complex one might get a score of 5. Now, let's assign scores to each of the 5 jokes mentioned in the question:  Joke 1: Pun - Score = 2 Joke 2: Sarcasm - Score = 3 Joke 3: Irony - Score = 4 Joke 4: Wordplay - Score = 5 Therefore, the total score for these 5 jokes is: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16 Now, we need to find out how many times each type of joke appears in the list of 10 jokes given at the end of the passage. Let's count them:  Type of Joke No. of Jokes  Puns - 3 Sarcasm - 2 Irony - 2 Wordplay - 3 Therefore, the person who wrote those 10 jokes must have used a mix of all four types of humor!;
Response:  We know that 3 people can eat 3 meals in one day, and each meal takes 2 hours to prepare. So, in total, it will take 6 hours (3 x 2) to prepare all 9 meals. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for 3 people to eat all 9 meals. To do this, we divide the total time required to prepare all meals by the number of people eating them. In this case, it is 3 days (6 hours / 3 people). Therefore, the answer is 3 days.;
Response:  We know that 8 months have passed since Jagan took office as CM of Andhra Pradesh. So, there are 8 x 30 = 240 days in those 8 months. Now, we need to find out how many days have passed since Jagan took office till now. Therefore, we subtract the number of days that have passed since he took office from the total number of days in those 8 months. Hence, the answer is: 240 - 168 = 72 days.;
Response:  We know that 4 minutes are subtracted from 30 minutes to get 26 minutes. So, we have 26 minutes left after subtracting 4 minutes from 30 minutes. Now, let's consider the remaining time in hours and minutes. We have 8 hours and 26 minutes left after subtracting 4 minutes from 30 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (8 \* 60) + (26) = 516 minutes.;
Response:  We know that 3 minutes are subtracted from 4 hours to get 1 hour and 20 minutes (36 minutes). So, if we add 8 hours to 1 hour and 20 minutes, we get 9 hours and 40 minutes (74 minutes). Therefore, the difference between 3 minutes and 9 hours and 40 minutes is 8 hours and 57 minutes (87 minutes).;
Response:  We know that 7 + 17 = 24. So, out of 24 minutes, 7 minutes are in the morning and 17 minutes are in the evening. Therefore, the remaining 9 minutes (24 - 7 - 17) are between 12 noon and 5 pm.;
Response:  We know that 9 + 10 = 19 and 7 + 3 = 10. So, we have two options: 19 - 10 = 9 or 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.;
Response:  We know that Jagath has 10 hours of work to complete and he can do 5 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening. So, we have to find out how many days it will take him to complete his work. To do this, we need to divide the total number of hours he has to work (10) by the number of hours he can work per day (5 + 4 = 9). Therefore, it will take Jagath 10 / 9 = 1.11 days or approximately 1 day and 8 hours to complete his work.;
Response:  We know that Jagath has 6 hours of work to complete in the morning and he completes 3 hours of work in the first hour. So, he has completed 3/6 = 0.5 hours of work in the first hour. Now, we need to find out how much time it takes for him to complete 10 minutes of work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the time taken to complete 10 minutes as follows: Time taken to complete 10 minutes = 60 minutes / 10 minutes = 6 hours Therefore, Jagath will take 6 hours to complete 10 minutes of work.;
"Response:  We know that Jagath has 3 minutes to complete his work and he can do it in either of the following ways:

1. He can do 5 minutes of work and then take a break for 2 minutes. This means he will have completed 7 minutes of work (5 + 2 = 7).
2. He can do 6 minutes of work and then take a break for 1 minute. This means he will have completed 7 minutes of work (6 + 1 = 7).

Now, let's see how many breaks Jagath takes in total:

If he takes 2 minutes of break after completing 5 minutes of work, he will have taken a total of 2 + 2 = 4 minutes of breaks.
If he takes 1 minute of break after completing 6 minutes of work, he will have taken a total of 1 + 1 = 2 minutes of breaks.

So, the number of breaks Jagath takes is 4 or 2, depending on which way he chooses to complete his work. Therefore, the answer is 4 or 2.";

Now let's find out how many shoes each person has after the exchange. 
Jagadeesh has 2 pairs of shoes + 6 socks = 8 items (shoes + socks). 
Ravi has 7 pairs of shoes + 4 socks = 11 items (shoes + socks). 
So the final answer is: 
Jagadeesh has 8 items, Ravi has 11 items.";
Response:  We know that Jagath has 10 hours of work in the morning and 12 hours of work in the afternoon. So, his total working time is 10 + 12 = 22 hours per day. Now, we are told that he works for 3 months, so his total working days are 22 x 3 = 66 days. Finally, we are asked how many minutes he works in a month. Since there are 1440 minutes in a day, we can calculate the number of minutes Jagath works in a month as follows: 66 days x 1440 minutes/day = 91760 minutes. Therefore, Jagath works for 91760 minutes in a month.;
"Response:  We know that Jagath has 6 hours of work and he can complete 2 tasks in an hour. So, the total number of tasks he can complete is:

6 hours x 2 tasks/hour = 12 tasks

Now, we are told that Jagath completed 8 tasks out of which 2 were completed by him alone. Therefore, the remaining 4 tasks were completed by others. So, the number of tasks completed by others is:

8 tasks - 2 tasks (completed by Jagath) = 6 tasks

Therefore, the answer to the question is 6 tasks.";
Response:  Jagath has 6 minutes to spend and he spends 2 minutes with each of his friends. So, in total, he spends 2 x 6 = 12 minutes with his friends. Now, there are 91 days in a year, so Jagath has 91 x 12 = 1092 hours to spend with his friends in a year.;
Response:  Jagath has 4 hours to complete 2 tasks in the morning and 6 hours to complete 8 tasks in the evening. So, he will have 10 hours (4 + 6) to work in total. Now, let's calculate how many minutes Jagath will have to spend on each task: Morning: 2 tasks x 2 hours = 4 hours Evening: 8 tasks x 6 hours = 48 hours Total time spent = 10 hours / 60 minutes per hour = 166.67 minutes Therefore, Jagath will be able to complete all 9 tasks in 166.67 minutes or approximately 3 hours and 5 minutes.;
Response:  Jagath has 9 minutes to complete 7 tasks in the morning and he completes some of them. So, let's assume that he completed x tasks out of 7. Now, we have to find out how many minutes it took him to complete each task. Let's assume that the time taken to complete each task is y minutes. Then, we can calculate the total time taken by Jagath to complete all the tasks as follows: Total time = (Number of tasks completed) x (Time taken to complete one task) = (x) x (y) = (7) x (y) - (x) x (y) = 7y - xy Now, we are given that Jagath had 9 minutes left after completing his tasks. So, we can set up the equation as follows: 9 = 7y - xy Subtracting 7y from both sides gives us: 2 = xy Divide both sides by x to get: y = 2/x Now, we know that Jagath completed x tasks out of 7, so x = 5. Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get: 9 = 7(2) - (5)(2)/5 = 14 - 10 = 4 Therefore, Jagath took 4 minutes to complete all the tasks.;
Response:  We know that Jagath has 3 hours of work in the morning and 5 hours of work in the evening. So, his total working time is 3 + 5 = 8 hours per day. Now, we are asked how many minutes he works in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jagath works for 8 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes per day. Therefore, Jagath works for 480 minutes per day.;
Response:  If Jagath has 3 hours of free time in the morning and he spends 2 hours on each of the following activities - exercise, meditation, reading, and learning music - then he will have only 1 hour of free time left for other activities. So, he can do any one activity among the remaining four options (watching TV, playing video games, chatting with friends, or taking a nap) during that extra hour of free time. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 angulas in each pulla and 12 angulas in each tavali. So, the total number of angulas in one kuditham is: 9 x 4 = 36 + 12 = 48 angulas. Therefore, the answer is 48.;
Response:  Pulangal is 31 years old and Tavali is 35 years old. So, their age difference is 4 years (35 - 31 = 4). Therefore, the correct answer is B) 4 years.;
Response:  NarI (36) - Thavali (17) = 19  El (15) - Thavali (17) = -2  So, there are 19 eggs and -2 eli in the pot.;
"Response:  NarI (நரி) means ""water"" in Tamil. So, we have two options for the first letter of the word: ந or ற. Since there are more words starting with ந than ற, let's choose ந as the first letter. Now, we need to find out how many words start with ந and end with -க்கும். There are 25 such words in total. Among them, 18 words start with தவளை (தவளை means ""waves"") and end with -க்கும், while 7 words start with எலி (எலி means ""oil"") and end with -க்கும். Therefore, the answer is 18 + 7 = 25.";
Response:  Narikkal (நரி) is the first letter of the Tamil alphabet and has a value of 1. Thavalai (தவளை) is the second letter and has a value of 2. Eli (எலி) is the third letter and has a value of 3. So far, we have 6 letters with values as follows:  Narikkal - 1 Thavalai - 2 Eli - 3 Total so far = 6 Now let's find out how many letters are there after the 10th letter in the Tamil alphabet. There are 9 letters after the 10th letter, which are: Kudam (குடம்), Mulakku (முலாக்கு), Padai (படை), Thenral (தேன்றல்), Vizhundhu (виசுნ்து), Uzhaithu (உழைது), Neer (நீர்), Azhagu (அஸ்கு), and Arai (அரை). Therefore, the total number of letters in the Tamil alphabet is 6 + 9 = 15. Finally, let's calculate the sum of all the letters: 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 15 = 75. So, the answer to the question is 75.;
"Response:  We know that there are 19 types of clouds and they are classified into three categories - Cirrus, Stratus, and Cumulus. So, we have:
Cirrus = 3 (since there are 3 subtypes of Cirrus clouds)
Stratus = 7 (since there are 7 subtypes of Stratus clouds)
Cumulus = 19 (since there are 19 subtypes of Cumulus clouds)
Total number of cloud types = 3 + 7 + 19 = 39
Now, let's find out how many types of clouds are visible in the sky at any given time. According to the question, ""thirty-nine"" types of clouds can be seen in the sky at any given time. Therefore, the answer is 39.";
Response:  NarI (நரி) is the king of elephants and has 25 tusks. Tavali (தவளை) is the queen of elephants and has 32 tusks. Eli (எலி) is the prince of elephants and has 26 tusks. So, Eli has more tusks than Tavali. Therefore, the answer is B - Eli has more tusks than Tavali.;
Response:  Narikkal (நரி) has 24 angles and each angle has 360 degrees. So, total number of degrees in narikkal is 24 x 360 = 8640 degrees.  Thavalai (தவளை) has 33 angles and each angle has 360 degrees. So, total number of degrees in thavalai is 33 x 360 = 12960 degrees. Eli (எலி) has 5 angles and each angle has 360 degrees. So, total number of degrees in eli is 5 x 360 = 1800 degrees. Therefore, the difference between the total number of degrees in narikkal and that in thavalai is 8640 - 12960 = -4320 degrees. Similarly, the difference between the total number of degrees in narikkal and that in eli is 8640 - 1800 = -6840 degrees.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 angula in one pulla and 2 angulas in one vada. So, if we want to find out how many angulas are in one thovalai, we need to divide the number of angulas in one pulla (13) by the number of angulas in one vada (2). Therefore, the number of angulas in one thovalai is 13 / 2 = 6.5 angulas.;
Response:  We know that there are 35 angulas in one pulla. So, if we take 4 angulas from each pulla, then we will have taken 140 angulas (4 x 35). Now, let's see how many pulaangal are left after taking 140 angulas. There are 35 pulaangal in total, and after taking 140 angulas, we will be left with 25 pulaangal (35 - 140 = 25). Therefore, the number of pulaangal left after taking 4 angulas from each is 25.;
Response:  NarI has 19 angles and ElI has 44 angles. So, there are 19 + 44 = 63 angles in total. Therefore, the answer is 63.;
Response:  NarI has 39 angles and out of them, 19 angles are visible. So, the number of invisible angles is 39 - 19 = 20. Eli has 12 angles and out of them, 6 angles are visible. So, the number of invisible angles for Eli is 12 - 6 = 6. Therefore, the total number of invisible angles is 20 + 6 = 26.;
Response:  NarI has 21 angles and Eli has 16 angles. So, there are more than 47 angles in total (21 + 16 = 37). But we were asked to find out how many angles NarI has more than Eli. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of angles that Eli has from the total number of angles.  So, the difference between NarI and Eli is 37 - 16 = 21 angles.;
Response:  We know that புல்லாங்குழல் (pulled) is equal to 39 and தவளை (thavalai) is equal to 17. Now we need to find out how many times நரி (nari) can be divided into எவ்வளவு (evvalavu). To do this, we divide நரி (nari) by தவளை (thavalai): நரி / தவளை = 26. So, நரி (nari) can be divided into எவ்வளவு (evvalavu) 26 times. Therefore, the answer is 26.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 types of clouds and they are classified into three categories - Narri (N), Thavalai (T) and Eli (E). So, we have N = 9, T = 3 and E = 6. Now, let's see how many types of clouds each category has.  For Narri, we have 3 types of clouds - Koothu (K), Mullum (M) and Ullam (U). So, N(K) + N(M) + N(U) = 3. Similarly, for Thavalai, we have 2 types of clouds - Kaikudi (K) and Marakkudy (M). So, T(K) + T(M) = 2. And for Eli, we have 4 types of clouds - Karai (K), Mullai (M), Neer (N) and Paarthal (P). So, E(K) + E(M) + E(N) + E(P) = 4. Therefore, the total number of types of clouds is N(K) + N(M) + N(U) + T(K) + T(M) + E(K) + E(M) + E(N) + E(P) = 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 14.;
Response:  Narikkal (நரி) has 14 angles, Thavalai (தவளை) has 37 angles, and Eli (எலி) has 16 angles. So, in total, there are 57 angles.;
Response:  Meri (my) is equal to 3. Oru (a/an) kegg (kettle) sudu (teapot) ullathu (is). So, there are 3 teapots. Sreyam (he/she) has taken 14 cups of tea and given 6 cups to others. Therefore, he/she has 9 cups left. Now, Avva (mother) has taken 5 cups of tea. So, the remaining number of cups that can be filled in the kettle is 9 - 5 = 4 cups.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of water in total and she has already drunk 4 cups. So, there are 5 cups left. Now, we need to find out how many cups she can drink at most before finishing all the water. Since she is thirsty, she will definitely finish all the remaining water. Therefore, the maximum number of cups she can drink is equal to the total number of cups minus the number of cups she has already drunk, which is 5 - 4 = 1 cup.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 crows and 13 dogs in the picture. The crow has 4 wings, so it can fly away with 2 wings left. Therefore, the number of crows left after some of them flew away is 6 - 2 = 4. Now, we need to find out how many dogs are left after some of them ran away. According to the question, 8 dogs ran away, which means that the number of dogs left is 13 - 8 = 5. So, the final answer is 4 crows and 5 dogs.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 11 kg of sugar and she wants to distribute it equally among 7 people. So each person will get 11/7 = 1.6 kg of sugar. But Meera also gave some sugar to her friends, so let's subtract the amount given to friends from the total amount of sugar Meera had. Therefore, the remaining amount of sugar after giving it away is 11 - (2 x 1.6) = 4.8 kg.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 11 kg of sugar and she wants to distribute it equally among 6 people. So, each person will get 11/6 = 1.83 kg of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 1.83 kg.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 12 kg of rice and 5 kg of sugar. She wants to distribute them equally among 3 people. So each person will get 4 kg of rice and 1.67 kg of sugar (since there are 3 people). Now, let's calculate how much each person will get if we divide the remaining amount equally among themselves. There is 2 kg of rice left after distributing 4 kg to each of the 3 people, so each person will get 0.67 kg of rice ( since there are 3 people). Similarly, there is 1.67 kg of sugar left after distributing 1.67 kg to each of the 3 people, so each person will get 0.567 kg of sugar ( since there are 3 people). Therefore, the final answer is : 4 kg of rice + 0.67 kg of rice = 4.67 kg of rice per person 5 kg of sugar + 1.67 kg of sugar = 6.67 kg of sugar per person.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 9 cats and 5 dogs. She also has 3 more cats than dogs. So, the number of cats she has is 9 + 3 = 12. Now, we are asked how many cats Meera will have if she adds 62 more cats to her existing collection. Therefore, the total number of cats Meera will have after adding 62 more cats is 12 + 62 = 74 cats.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 5 kg of sugar and she gives 3 kg to her friend. So, Meera now has 5 - 3 = 2 kg of sugar left.  Now, we are told that Avni takes 10 kg of sugar from Meera. So, Meera now has 2 - 10 = -8 kg of sugar left (since negative numbers indicate how much Meera has borrowed). Finally, we are told that Avni returns 2 kg of sugar to Meera. So, Meera now has -8 - 2 = -10 kg of sugar left. Therefore, the answer is -10 kg.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 12 kg of sugar and she wants to make 5 kg of sweets for her friends. So, we need to calculate how much sugar is left after making those sweets.  After calculating, we will find out how many kilograms of sugar are left with Meera.  Now, let's see what the calculation is:  Sugar required for sweets = 5 kg x 100% = 5000 grams (since each sweet requires 1/4th of a gram of sugar) Sugar available with Meera = 12 kg - 5000 grams = 7000 grams (or 7 kg) Therefore, there are 7 kg of sugar left with Meera after making 5 kg of sweets.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 10 kg of sugar and she wants to distribute it equally among 8 people. So each person will get 1.25 kg (10/8) of sugar. But then she realizes that there are 7 people left after distributing the sugar equally among 8 people. So each remaining person will get 1 kg (7/2 = 3.5) of sugar. Therefore, the final amount of sugar each person gets is 3.5 kg.;
Response:  The girl has 12 kg of rice and she wants to distribute it equally among 7 people. So each person will get 12/7 = 1.7 kg of rice.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Meera has 6 kg of sugar and she gives 2 kg to her friend. So, Meera now has 4 kg of sugar left with her.  Next, we are told that Meera's friend has 8 kg of rice and he gives 3 kg to Meera. So, Meera now has 5 kg of rice from her friend.  Finally, we are asked how much rice Meera will have if she gives 1 kg of rice to her mother. Well, if Meera gives 1 kg of rice to her mother, then she will have 4 kg of rice left with her. Therefore, the answer is 4 kg.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 12 kg of sugar and she wants to give 2 kg to her friend. So, there are 10 kg of sugar left with Meera after giving 2 kg to her friend. Now, we have to find out how many bags of 5 kg each can be made from these 10 kg of sugar. To do this, we divide the total weight (10 kg) by the weight of each bag (5 kg): 10 kg / 5 kg = 2 bags. Therefore, Meera can make 2 bags of sugar.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 9 cats and 6 dogs. She gave 4 of her cats to her friend. So, now she has 9 - 4 = 5 cats left with her. Similarly, we can calculate the number of dogs she has left as follows: 6 - 4 = 2 dogs. Therefore, Meera has 5 cats and 2 dogs left with her.;
Response:  The girl has 6 kg of sugar and wants to share it equally among 9 friends. So each friend will get 0.67 kg of sugar (6/9). But she doesn't want to give exactly that amount, so she decides to round off the number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each friend will get approximately 0.7 kg of sugar.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 5 kg of sugar and she wants to make 14 kg of sweets. So, she will need additional 9 kg of sugar (14 - 5 = 9). Now, we also know that each sweet requires 0.75 gm of sugar. Therefore, to calculate the number of sweets Meera can make with her remaining sugar, we can use the following formula: Number of sweets = Total weight of sugar / Weight of one sweet x Conversion factor. Here, conversion factor is 0.75 gm/sweet. Substituting the values, we get: Number of sweets = 9 kg / 0.75 gm/sweet = 11,738 sweets. So, Meera can make approximately 11,738 sweets with her remaining 5 kg of sugar.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 cups of sugar in 10 kg of sugar. So, if Avanti has already taken out 5 kg of sugar, then she has taken out 5 x 3 = 15 cups of sugar. Therefore, Avanti still has 10 - 15 = 5 kg of sugar left.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 5 kg of sugar and she wants to make 13 kg of sweets. So, we need to find out how much sugar is required for each sweet. Since each sweet requires 0.4 kg of sugar, we can calculate the total amount of sugar needed as follows: Total Amount of Sugar Required = Number of Sweets x Amount of Sugar per Sweet Total Amount of Sugar Required = 13 kg x 0.4 kg/sweet = 5.2 kg Now, since Meera already has 5 kg of sugar, she will have enough sugar to make 5.2 kg / 5 kg = 1.04 kg of sweets. Therefore, Meera will be able to make 1.04 kg of sweets with the sugar she currently has.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 6 kg of sugar and she wants to make 14 kg of sweets. So, she will need 8 kg of sugar (14 - 6 = 8). Now, we are told that each sweet requires 3 grams of sugar. Therefore, Meera will need 24 kg of sugar in total (8 kg x 3 g/kg = 24 kg). However, since she already has 6 kg of sugar, she only needs an additional 18 kg of sugar (24 kg - 6 kg = 18 kg).;
Response:  We know that  Meri has 11 kg of sugar and she wants to share it equally among 9 people. So each person will get 1.2 kg of sugar (11/9 = 1.2). But then she realizes that there are 12 people in total including her, so she needs to adjust the amount accordingly. Therefore, each person will get 1.1 kg of sugar (12 - 9 = 3), which is the remaining amount after sharing 1.2 kg among the first 9 people.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 3 kg of sugar and she wants to make 10 kg of sweets. So, she will need 7 kg of sugar (10 - 3 = 7). Now, we also know that each sweet requires 1/4 cup of sugar. Therefore, Meera will need 7 kg x 1/4 cup/kg = 1 1/2 cups of sugar for making all the sweets. Since there are 8 cups in 1 lb, Meera will need 1 1/2 / 8 = 0.1875 lbs of sugar for making all the sweets. So, the answer is 0.1875 lbs.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 9 cats and she gave 4 of them to her friend. So, now Meera has 5 cats left with herself.  Now, we are asked how many cats Meera will have if she gives 3 more cats to her friend. To find this out, we need to subtract 3 from 5, which gives us 2. Therefore, Meera will have 2 cats left after giving 3 more cats to her friend.;
Response:  The girl has 9 capsules of sugar and wants to share them equally among 7 friends. So, each friend will get 1 capful (1/7) = 0.142857 (approximately). Now, she has 4 remaining capsules, which she can distribute among 4 other people. Each person will get 1/4 = 0.25 (approximately) of a capful. Therefore, the total number of capfuls that the girl will give away is 0.142857 + 0.25 = 0.393657 (approximately).;
Response:  The girl has 11 kg of sugar and she wants to distribute it equally among 4 people. So each person will get 2.75 kg of sugar (11/4). Now, there are 3 more people who want to take some sugar from her, so they will get 0.875 kg of sugar each (9/4). Therefore, the total amount of sugar that the girl will have left after distributing it is 2.75 + 0.875 = 3.625 kg.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 7 kg of sugar and she wants to give 4 kg of it to her friend. So, there are 3 kg of sugar left with Meera after giving 4 kg to her friend. Now, we have to find out how much money Meera will get for selling those 3 kg of sugar.  As per the question, each kilogram of sugar is worth Rs. 10, so Meera will get Rs. 30 (3 kg x Rs. 10/kg) for selling those 3 kg of sugar. Therefore, the answer is Rs. 30.;
Response:  We know that Meera has 12 kg of sugar and she wants to make 14 kg of ghee. So, we need to find out how much sugar is required for making one kg of ghee.  To do this, we can use the following formula: Sugar required = Ghee desired / (Sugar available x Conversion ratio) Where: Sugar required = amount of sugar needed to make one kg of ghee Ghee desired = amount of ghee Meera wants to make (in this case, 14 kg) Sugar available = amount of sugar Meera has (in this case, 12 kg) Conversion ratio = proportion of sugar required to make one kg of ghee (usually around 1.5 - 2) Now, let's plug in the values: Sugar required = 14 kg / (12 kg x 1.75) = 8.67 kg So, Meera needs approximately 8.67 kg of sugar to make 14 kg of ghee.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 elephants in the circus and they are all male. So, the total number of male elephants in the circus is 19. Now, we are told that out of these 19 males, 60% of them have been trained to perform acrobatics. Therefore, the number of male elephants who have been trained to perform acrobatics is:  $\frac{60}{100} \times 19 = 11$ elephants. So, there are 11 male elephants in the circus who have been trained to perform acrobatics.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 elephants in the circus and 7 of them are pregnant. Now, let's assume that each pregnant elephant gives birth to only one baby elephant. So, the total number of newborn elephants will be 7 x 1 = 7. Therefore, after giving birth, there will be 87 - 7 = 80 elephants left in the circus.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 elephants in total and they are divided into two groups of 10 each.  Then, out of these 10 elephants, 5 were taken away from one group and given to another group. So, now we have 5 elephants left in the first group and 5 new elephants added to it. Similarly, we have 5 elephants left in the second group and 5 new elephants added to it. Therefore, the final number of elephants in both groups is : 5 + 5 = 10 elephants in Group A and 5 + 5 = 10 elephants in Group B.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 85 elephants in the Malaiyaras forest and 23 of them have been killed by the poachers. So, the number of surviving elephants is 85 - 23 = 62. Now, we also know that out of these 62 surviving elephants, 17 were pregnant females. So, the number of non-pregnant elephants among the survivors is 62 - 17 = 45. Finally, we are asked how many elephants are left in the forest after the poaching incident. Therefore, the answer to the question is 45 elephants.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 elephants in Malai and 42 elephants in Aappirika. So, if all the elephants from Malai come to Aappirika, there will be 50 elephants (8 + 42) in total. However, since some of the elephants from Malai cannot cross the river, only 31 elephants can reach Aappirika. Therefore, the number of elephants left behind in Malai is 19 (8 - 31).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 elephants in Malai and 47 elephants in Avirappali. So, the total number of elephants in both places is 38 + 47 = 85 elephants. Now, we need to find out how many elephants are left after 94 elephants from Avirappali come to Malai. To do this, we subtract the number of elephants that came from Avirappali (94) from the total number of elephants in both places (85): 85 - 94 = -10 elephants. Therefore, there are -10 elephants left in Malai after 94 elephants from Avirappali come to Malai.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 elephants in Malai and 38 elephants in Aapirikaa. So, the total number of elephants in both places is 18 + 38 = 56 elephants. Now, we are asked how many elephants will be left if 80 elephants from Aapirikaa come to Malai. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of elephants that will go to Malai (80) from the total number of elephants in Aapirikaa (38). Therefore, the number of elephants left in Aapirikaa after 80 elephants go to Malai is 38 - 80 = -42 elephants. So, there will be -42 elephants left in Aapirikaa after they move to Malai.;
Response:  We know that there are 87 elephants in total and 18 of them have been trained to ride bicycles. So, if we want to find out how many elephants can fit on one bicycle, we need to divide the number of elephants that can ride bicycles (18) by the total number of elephants (87). Therefore, the answer is 18/87 = 0.2094 or approximately 20%.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 elephants in the circus and they are all male. Then, out of these 49 males, 24 have been trained to perform acrobatic stunts. So, the number of elephants left without training is 49 - 24 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 untrained male elephants in the circus.;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 elephants in the circus and they all have to fit into one big tent. Now, if each elephant takes up an area of 10 square feet (which is a rough estimate), then the total area occupied by all the elephants would be:

Area = Number of elephants x Area per elephant
= 27 x 10 sq ft
= 270 sq ft
Now, let's assume that the big tent can accommodate only half of this area, i.e., it can hold 135 sq ft (half of 270 sq ft). So, the number of elephants that can fit inside the big tent at once is:

Number of elephants that can fit = Total available area / Area per elephant
= 135 sq ft / 10 sq ft
= 13.5 elephants
Therefore, the answer to the question is 13.5 elephants.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 86 puppies in the kennel and they all need to be vaccinated.  Out of these, 45 puppies have already been vaccinated. So, the remaining number of puppies that need to be vaccinated is 86 - 45 = 41.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 elephants in Malai and 35 of them belong to Asiyaavu. So, the number of elephants belonging to Asiyaavu is 35. Now, we also know that out of these 35 elephants, 62 belong to Appirigakaavu. Therefore, the number of elephants belonging to Appirigakaavu is 62 - 35 = 27.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 big whales and 26 small whales in total. Among them, 10 whales were born in the sea and 16 whales were born in the bay. So, the number of whales born in the sea is 10. Now, let's count the number of whales born in the bay. Out of 26 small whales, 2 were born in the bay. Therefore, the number of whales born in the bay is 2. Finally, the total number of whales born is 10 + 2 = 12. Hence, the answer is 12.;
Response:  Balan is 60 years old and has been working for 25 years in the same company. He has saved Rs. 253 crore during his tenure there. Now he wants to retire at the age of 60 with a pension of Rs. 70 lakh per annum. How many years will it take him to save this amount? Solution: To calculate how many years it will take Balan to save Rs. 70 lakh per annum as his pension, we need to divide the total savings (Rs. 253 crore) by the annual pension amount (Rs. 70 lakh). This gives us the number of years required to save the pension amount: Number of years = Total savings / Annual pension amount = Rs. 253 crore / Rs. 70 lakh = 3648 months or 319 years Therefore, it will take Balan approximately 319 years to save Rs. 70 lakh per annum as his pension if he continues to work for another 25 years after reaching the age of 60.;
Response:  Balan is said to have written 551 poems in Tamil during his lifetime. However, he could not complete 177 of them fully. So, the number of incomplete poems that Balan wrote is 374 (551 - 177).;
Response:  Balu had 440 grams of rice in his bag and gave 111 grams to his friend. So he has 329 grams of rice left (440 - 111 = 329). Then, he gave 106 grams of rice to another friend. Now he has 223 grams of rice left (329 - 106 = 223). Therefore, the number of grams of rice that Balu gave away is 223 grams.;
Response:  Balan is 65 years old and has 213 relatives. He gave 16 gifts to his relatives in one year. So, he gave 16/213 = 0.074 (approximately) gifts per relative.;
Response:  Balan has 589 friends and he gave 571 gifts to them. So, he had 161 gifts left over. Now, we need to find out how many gifts each of his remaining friends received from him.;
Response:  Balan has 110 kg of rice and he wants to distribute it equally among his 90 friends. So, each friend will get 1.2 kg of rice (110/90). Now, Balan has 412 kg of rice left after distributing 1.2 kg to each of his 90 friends. Therefore, he has 300 kg of rice remaining (412 - 1.2 x 90 = 300).;
Response:  Balan has 563 greetings for his friends and relatives in total. Out of them, he gave 558 greetings to his friends and relatives during that year. So, the number of remaining greetings is 563 - 558 = 332. Therefore, Balan had 332 greetings left after giving all the greetings to his friends and relatives during that year.;
Response:  Balan has 52 cards in his deck and he gives one card to each of his 5 friends. So, the total number of cards given by Balan is 5 x 52 = 260 cards. Now, out of these 260 cards, Balan has 13 cards left with him, which means that he gave away 260 - 13 = 247 cards. Therefore, the difference between the number of cards Balan had (52) and the number of cards he gave away (247) is 52 - 247 = -205 cards.;
Response:  We know that Balan had 521 kgs of gold and 66 diamonds. He gave away 154 kg of gold to his friend as a gift. So, he has 367 kg of gold left (521 - 154 = 367). Now, let's calculate the value of the remaining gold. If each kg of gold is worth Rs. 50, then the total value of the remaining gold is: 367 kg x Rs. 50/kg = Rs. 18,350. Therefore, the correct answer is Rs. 18,350.;
Response:  Balan had 531 kgs of gold and 38 diamonds worth Rs. 391 crores. He gave away all his wealth to charity except for one diamond which he kept with him. So, the number of diamonds he kept with him is 38 - 1 = 37.;
Response:  We know that Balan has 601 kg of rice and 406 kg of wheat. If he gives away 336 kg of rice to someone, then he will have 265 kg of rice left (601 - 336 = 265). Similarly, if he gives away 278 kg of wheat to someone, then he will have 128 kg of wheat left (406 - 278 = 128). So, in total, Balan will have 265 + 128 = 393 kg of food items left after giving them away.;
Response:  Balan is 31 years old and he has been working for 8 years in the company. So his total service in the company is 8 + 31 = 40 years. Now, we need to find out how many days he worked in the company before he turned 31 years old. We know that Balan was born on January 1st, so let's count from there. He was 1 year old on January 1st, then he was 2 years old on January 1st of the next year, and so on until he turned 31 years old on January 1st of the current year. Therefore, the number of days Balan worked in the company before he turned 31 years old is: 31 - 1 = 30 years.;
Response:  Balan had 267 cards in his deck and gave 231 of them to Anandh. So, he has 36 cards left (267 - 231 = 36). Now, Anandh took all of Balan's remaining cards (36), so Balan has no cards left (36 - 36 = 0). Therefore, the answer is 0.;
Response:  We know that Balan had 457 rupees and 320 grams of rice. After spending money on various things, he was left with 523 rupees. Now, let's calculate how much rice he could buy with this amount. There are 160 grams in 1 rupee, so to find out how many grams of rice he can buy with his remaining money, we divide the amount he has (523 rupees) by the cost per gram of rice (160 grams): 523 / 160 = 3.28 So, Balan can buy approximately 3.28 kilograms of rice with the remaining money he has.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 students in total and 3 of them have already taken their exams. So, the remaining 8 students will take their exams next. Therefore, the answer is 8.;
Response:  We have 3 chefs and they can cook 4 dishes each. So in total, we have 3 x 4 = 12 dishes. But then we are told that some of these dishes are not available. Let's assume that out of the 12 dishes, 3 are not available. So, the number of available dishes is 12 - 3 = 9.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 veterinarians and they have treated 12 animals. So, each veterinarian has treated an average of 1.33 animals (12 / 9).;
Response:  We have 14 students in total and we need to find out how many of them are left after 5 students have been eliminated. So, the number of remaining students is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 students who are not eliminated.;
Response:  We have 13 students in total and we need to divide them into groups of 4 each. So, the number of groups that can be formed is 13 / 4 = 3.25 groups (since you cannot have a group with fractional members). Now, out of these 3.25 groups, 9 students are already assigned to groups. Therefore, the remaining 0.75 groups (or 3 students) do not have any assignments.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 students in total and 15 of them passed their exams. So, the number of students who did not pass is (12 - 15) = -3. Therefore, the remaining 14 students who passed their exams are the ones who will be promoted to higher classes.;

Response:  We have 8 directors in total and each director has to appoint at least one subordinate as an assistant director. So, the number of assistant directors appointed by these 8 directors is at least 8 x 1 = 8. Now, we are told that some of these directors may have appointed more than one assistant director. In fact, 5 out of these 8 directors have appointed only 1 assistant director each, so the total number of assistant directors appointed by these 5 directors is 5 x 1 = 5. Therefore, the total number of assistant directors appointed by all 8 directors including those who appointed none is 8 + 5 = 13.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 veterinarians in total and some of them have left their jobs to become farmers. So, let's assume that out of 12 veterinarians, 4 have left their jobs to become farmers. Now, we need to find out how many veterinarians are left after 10 new veterinarians joined the profession. Therefore, the number of veterinarians left = 12 - 4 = 8. So, among the remaining 8 veterinarians, 3 have become farmers, leaving us with 5 veterinarians who have not become farmers.;

Response:  Avatar has 99 cents in his pocket and he wants to buy three dollar bills. So, how much money does he have left after buying three dollar bills? We know that one dollar bill is equal to 100 cents, so Avatar will have 99 - (3 x 100) = 99 - 300 = -101 cents left after buying three dollar bills. Therefore, the answer is -101 cents.;
Response:  We know that there are three people in total - A, B and C.  Each person has to pay either $3 or $4 for their ticket. So, the total amount of money paid by all three people is:  A pays $3 + B pays $4 + C pays $3 = $10. Now, we have $10 - $4 (the cost of four tickets) = $6 left over. Therefore, each person has to pay $6 / 3 = $2 per ticket.;
Response:  We know that the total value of the items is $ 20 and Avatar has spent $ 6 on some other things. So, he has $ 14 left. Now, we are asked how much money Avatar will have after buying the remaining sakalam products. Since there are 3 sakalam products left, Avatar will spend $ 3 x 3 = $ 9 on them. Therefore, Avatar will have $ 14 - $ 9 = $ 5 left after buying the remaining sakalam products.;
Response:  The man has $ 7 in his pocket and he spends $ 2 for a sandwich. So, he is left with $ 5 ($ 7 - $ 2). Now, he buys another sandwich worth $ 3, so he spends $ 3 more. Therefore, the final amount of money he has is $ 5 + $ 3 = $ 8.;
Response:  The man has $4 and he spends $2 on a sandwich. So, he has $4 - $2 = $2 left. Now, he buys a coffee for $1 and has $2 - $1 = $1 left. Finally, he gives $5 to charity, so he has $1 - $5 = -$4 left. Therefore, the man ends up with -$4.;
Response:  The man has $2 in his pocket and gives $6 to his friend as change for a $10 bill. So, he now has $2 - $6 = $4 left. Then, he buys another item worth $3 and pays with one of the remaining $4 bills. Therefore, after paying for both items, he will have $4 - $3 = $1 left.;
Response:  The man has $ 5 and he spends $ 2 for one sausage. So, he has $ 5 - $ 2 = $ 3 left. Now, he buys another sausage worth $ 3. So, his total amount of money left with him is $ 3 + $ 3 = $ 6. Therefore, the difference between the original amount of money he had ($ 5) and the final amount of money he has after buying two sausages ($ 6) is $ 6 - $ 5 = $ 1.;
Response:  The man gave $ 4 to Tan and took back $ 8 from him. So, the change given to Tan is $ 4 - $ 8 = -$ 4. Now, we need to find out how much money Tan had before giving it to the man. According to the problem, Tan had $ 16 initially ( $ 8 + $ 8). Therefore, the amount of money that Tan had after giving $ 4 to the man is $ 16 - $ 4 = $ 12.;
Response:  The man has $3 in his pocket initially and spends $4 for something. So, he now has $3 - $4 = $1 left with him. Therefore, the number of candy bars he can buy is 1.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 students in the class and each student has to pay Rs. 4 for the projector. So, the total amount of money that all the students have to pay together is: 10 students x Rs. 4 per student = Rs. 40. Therefore, the correct answer is Rs. 40.;
"Response:  We know that there are three people - A, B and C. Each of them has two bags containing different amounts of money. The total amount of money in all the bags is $30. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:
A + B + C = $30
Now, let's consider each person's share of the money. Since there are three people, they will get equal shares of the money. So, we can write another equation:
$10 = A + B + C
Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives us:
C = $10 - (A + B)
We don't know the values of A or B, but we do know that their sum is $10. So, we can substitute these values into the equation for C:
C = $10 - ($10 + x)
where x is the value of B. Solving for C, we get:
C = $10 - $20 = -$10
So, the third person, C, has negative $10. This means that the other two persons, A and B, have positive amounts of money. But since we don't know their individual amounts, we cannot determine which bag belongs to whom. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Which bag belongs to who?"" is not possible based on the information provided.";
Response:  The man has $ 5 and he spends $ 3 for one sausage. So, he has $ 5 - $ 3 = $ 2 left. Now, he buys two sausages costing $ 7 each. So, he pays $ 7 x 2 = $ 14. Therefore, he has $ 2 - $ 14 = -$ 12 left.;
Response:  The man has $4 and he spends $1 on a sandwich. So, he has $3 left. Then, he buys a toy for $2 and another one for $1. So, he has $2 left. Finally, he gives $5 as a tip. Therefore, the total amount of money he has after giving the tip is $2 + $5 = $7.;
Response:  We know that Balu has answered 115 questions correctly out of 200. So, the probability of Balu answering a particular question correctly is $\frac{115}{200}$. Now, we are asked to find the number of questions that Balu will answer incorrectly if he answers $78$ questions correctly. To do this, we need to subtract the number of correct answers from the total number of questions. Therefore, the number of incorrect answers = Total number of questions - Number of correct answers = $200 - 78 = 122$. So, Balu will answer $122$ questions incorrectly if he answers $78$ questions correctly.;
Response:  The man is 42 years old now and he was born in 1980. So his age at that time is 137 - 42 = 95 years. Now, let's calculate how many days he has lived so far. 137 - 105 = 32 years. Therefore, he has lived for 32 years.;
Response:  We know that there are 108 pujas performed in one Kerala festival.  Out of these, 35 pujas are dedicated to Lord Subramaniam and his consorts. So, the number of pujas left is 73 (108 - 35). Now, out of these remaining 73 pujas, 62 pujas are performed for other deities. Therefore, the number of pujas performed exclusively for Lord Subramaniam and his consorts is 35 (73 - 62).;

Response:  We know that there are 27 types of animals in the world and we have to find out how many types of dogs are there among them. So, let's count the number of dog breeds mentioned in the passage - 136. Since there are only 27 animal types in total, it means that at least 136/27 = 5 dogs belong to each type. Therefore, there are 5 dog breeds for every 27 animal types.;
Response:  We know that 134 people were present at the meeting and 39 of them spoke. So, there are 39 / 134 = 0.2957 (approximately) speakers per person in average. Now, we need to calculate how many people spoke more than once. From the question, we know that out of 39 speakers, 68 spoke only once. So, the number of people who spoke more than once is 68 - 39 = 29. Therefore, the total number of people who spoke at the meeting is 39 + 29 = 68.;

Response:  Firstly, Jesika has 33 rojakkals in her bag and she gave 15 of them to Poongoththu. So, there are 18 rojaka kalls left with Jesika (33 - 15 = 18). Now, Poongoththu took some of those remaining rojaka kalls from Jesika and gave it to his friend. So, the number of rojaka kalls that Poongoththu has now is 17 (18 - x where x is the number of rojaka kalls he gave to his friend). Therefore, the answer is 17.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 34 rojakkals in her bag and she wants to distribute them equally among 21 people. So, each person will get 1.6 (34/21) rojakaals. However, there are only 15 rojakaals left after distributing them equally among all the people. Therefore, Jesika has 15 - 1.6 = 13.4 rojakaals remaining in her bag.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 7 rojakkals in total and she gave 5 of them to her friend. So, the number of rojaka kals left with Jesika is 7 - 5 = 2. Now, out of these 2 rojaka kals, 10 are small and 5 are big. So, the number of small rojaka kals left with Jesika is 10 / 2 = 5. And the number of big rojaka kals left with Jesika is 5. Therefore, the final answer is 5 + 5 = 10 rojaka kals left with Jesika.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 13 rojakam in her pot. Then she gave some of them to her friends and relatives, so there are only 12 rojaka left with her.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 7 rojakkals and 12 arkkikizhels in her bag. Now, she wants to give some of them as gifts to her friends. So, let's assume she gives 3 rojakkals and 6 arkkikizhels as gifts. Therefore, the number of rojakkals left with Jesika is 7 - 3 = 4, and the number of arkkikizhels left is 12 - 6 = 6.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 19 rojakams in her hair. Now, out of these 19 rojakams, 3 are located at the back of her head. So, the number of rojakams left is 16 (19 - 3). Therefore, the number of rojakams Avvai can see is 16.;
Response:  We know that Jesika has 13 rojakkals and 84 phoonkottu. So, she must have at least 91 arkkikettens (since each rojakkal is equal to 9 arkkikkent). Therefore, the number of arkkikkents Jesika has is 91 + 14 = 105.;
Response:  We know that Jesika has 16 rojakkals and 3 arkkikizhangu.  Out of these, she gave 7 arkkikizhangu to her friend and kept 9 for herself. So, the number of rojakkals she had after giving away the arkkikizhangu is 16 - 7 = 9.  Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  Firstly, Jesika has 6 rose bushes and 20 artichokes in her garden.  Now, she wants to know how many orchids will fit in her garden after adding some more plants.  So, we need to find out how many orchids can be accommodated in addition to the existing ones.  We are given that there are 21 artichokes and 22 roses already present in the garden.  Therefore, if we add more orchids, they will have to be accommodated among these existing plants.  To do this, we need to divide the total number of orchids (which is 21) by the number of spaces available for them (i.e., among the existing plants).  This gives us an average of approximately 1.05 orchids per space.  So, in total, there can be around 21/4 = 5.25 orchids added to Jesika's garden.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesika has 9 rojakkals and 6 articulated trucks in her garage. Now, she wants to sell some of them. So, let's assume that she sold 4 rojakkals and 2 articulated trucks. Therefore, the number of rojakkals left with Jesika is 9 - 4 = 5, and the number of articulated trucks left is 6 - 2 = 4.  Now, there are 13 arkkikeddans and 3 rojakkals in Vasil's garage. Since he bought all the rojakkals from Jesika, the number of rojakkals left in Vasil's garage is 0. However, since he already had 3 arkkikeddans, the total number of arkkikeddans in his garage remains unchanged at 13.;

For Robert, his first finger is 1 angula long, second finger is 2 angulas long, third finger is 3 angulas long, and so on until he reaches his 16th finger which is also 1 angula long. Similarly for Avvai, her first finger is 11 angulas long, second finger is 12 angulas long, third finger is 13 angulas long, and so on until she reaches her 11th finger which is also 1 angula long. Therefore, the difference in length between Robert's and Avvai's fingers is 4 angulas (5 - 1).;
Response:  Robert is 30 years old and has been working for 19 years. If he started working at the age of 18, then he worked for 1 year before turning 18. So, the number of years he worked before turning 18 is 17. Therefore, the total number of years he worked is 19 + 17 = 36 years.;

Response:  Dennis has 12 toys in his bag and he gave 5 of them to Poongavanam. So, the number of toys that Dennis has left is 12 - 5 = 7. Now, we know that Poongavanam has 53 toys in her bag. Since she got 5 toys from Dennis, the number of toys that Poongavanam has now is 53 - 5 = 48. Therefore, the number of toys that Dennis has after giving 5 toys to Poongavanam is 7.;
Response:  Dennis has 21 boxes of chocolates in total and he wants to share them equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get 4 boxes of chocolates (21 / 5 = 4). Now, let's assume that there are some extra chocolates left after sharing them with all the friends. Out of these extra chocolates, if Dennis has 30 more chocolates than he gave to his first friend, then he must have given 30 + 4 = 34 chocolates to his first friend. Similarly, if he has 27 more chocolates than he gave to his second friend, then he must have given 27 + 4 = 31 chocolates to his second friend, and so on. Therefore, the number of chocolates Dennis has left after giving them to all his friends is: 34 + 31 + 27 + 23 + 19 = 165.;

From the given information, we know that Denali has 30 toppings and 14 sauces in his pizza shop. So, he can make 30 x 14 = 420 different combinations of toppings and sauces.

Now, let's assume that each combination is represented by a unique number from 1 to 420. Since Denali has 7 pizzas with 86 slices each, he can make 7 x 86 = 602 slices of pizza in total.

So, the probability of any particular combination (represented by a number from 1 to 420) being one of the 602 slices of pizza made by Denali is:

Probability = Number of ways to choose 86 slices out of 420 possibilities / Total number of possible combinations = 420/602 = 0.695 or approximately 69.5%

Therefore, the probability that the next slice of pizza made by Denali will have the same combination as the previous slice is approximately 69.5%.";
Response:  Avatar has 11 toys in his bag and he gives 28 pegs to Sita. So, there are 68 toys in total (11 + 28). Now, we need to find out how many pegs Sita gets from Avatar. Since Sita takes 51 pegs from Avatar, she gets 51 - 28 = 23 more pegs than what Avatar gave her.;
"Response:  Dennis has 71 paintings in his studio and he sells each painting for $500. So, the total amount of money he makes from selling those paintings is:

71 x $500 = $35,500

Now, let's consider the number of sculptures that Dennis has. He has 24 sculptures and he sells each sculpture for $1,000. So, the total amount of money he makes from selling those sculptures is:

24 x $1,000 = $24,000

In addition to these amounts, Dennis also has 16 paintings that are not yet sold. If he sells each of them for $500, then the additional amount of money he makes is:

16 x $500 = $8,000

Therefore, the total amount of money that Dennis makes from all of his artwork is:

$35,500 + $24,000 + $8,000 = $67,500";
Response:  Dennis has 10 toys in his bag and he gave 62 toys to his friend. So, there are 52 toys left with him (10 - 62 = 52). Now, out of these 52 toys, 27 are cars and 43 are dolls. Therefore, the number of cars that Dennis has is 27 / 52 = 0.5 (or half) and the number of dolls he has is 43 / 52 = 0.8 (or eighty percent).;
"Response: 

1. The number of toys Deni has is 66.
2. Out of these, 25 are cars.
3. So, the number of toys that Deni does not have is 66 - 25 = 41.
Therefore, the answer is 41.";
Response:  If there are 32 toppings in total and Denis has already eaten 25 of them, then he still has 8 toppings left (32 - 25 = 8). Now, if each pizza can hold up to 4 toppings, then Denis can have at most 8/4 = 2 pizzas. Therefore, the maximum number of pizzas that Denis can eat is 2.;
"Response: 

1. The first person has 60 toys in total and distributes them equally among 5 people, so each person gets 12 toys (60/5 = 12).
2. Since there are only 58 toys available in the second place, each of the remaining 4 people will get fewer toys than they did in the first place. To find out how many toys each person will get, we need to divide the number of toys available (58) by the number of people left (4): each person will get 14.5 toys (58/4 = 14.5).
3. Now, let's calculate the total number of toys that the five people have between them after distributing all 67 toys: 12 + 14.5 + 14.5 + 12 + 14.5 = 69 toys.
So, the answer is 69 toys.";
"Response: 

1. The first person has 30 toys in their bag and gives 20 of them away. So they have 30 - 20 = 10 toys left in their bag.
2. The second person receives 20 new toys from the first person and now has 20 + 20 = 40 toys in their bag.
3. The third person also receives 20 new toys from the second person and now has 30 + 20 = 50 toys in their bag.
4. The fourth person receives 10 new toys from the third person and now has 40 + 10 = 50 toys in their bag.
5. The fifth person receives nothing as they already have 60 toys in their bag.

So, after all the transactions are complete, there will be a total of 30 + 20 + 10 + 0 + 60 = 170 toys in the bags of all five people combined.";
Response:  The first person has 54 toys in total and distributes them equally among 48 people in 30 boxes of 1 toy each. So, each box contains 1 toy. Now, the second person wants to take 52 toys from the remaining 6 boxes (which contain 1 toy each). To find out how many toys are left after taking 52 toys, we need to subtract the number of toys taken by the second person from the total number of toys available. Therefore, the answer is  $ \boxed{52} $.;
Response:  Denali is 82 years old and has 29 peaks above 29,000 feet (8,800 meters). Therefore, he has climbed 42 peaks with an elevation of over 29,000 feet (8,800 meters) in his lifetime. Moreover, he has also summited 61 fourteeners. So, the number of peaks that Denali has climbed above 14,000 feet (4,300 meters) is 42 + 61 = 103.;
Response:  Dennis has 66 friends and he can invite 39 of them to his party in each of the 4 halls. So, the total number of people he can invite is 66 x 39 = 2574. However, he has already invited 16 people from his social circle, leaving him with 2574 - 16 = 2558 available slots for other guests.;
Response:  Dennis has 46 toys in his room and 50 books in his bookshelf. He can play with 21 toys at a time and 52 people are waiting for him outside. So, the number of toys he can give out is 21 x 52 = 1080 toys. Therefore, the answer is 1080.;
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Denali has 65 peaks and each peak is 5 miles wide. So, the total area of all the peaks is 65 x 5 = 325 square miles.

Now, we are told that Denali has 31 peaks that are above 10,000 feet in elevation. So, the total area of these peaks is 31 x 10,000 = 310,000 square miles.

Finally, we are asked to find out how many peaks Denali has that are both above 10,000 feet in elevation and have an area of at least 1 square mile. Based on the information given earlier, there are 31 such peaks. Therefore, the answer is (31/65) x 100 = 47%.";
Response:  Denali has 58 peaks above 13,000 feet and 25 peaks above 16,000 feet. So, he climbed 11 peaks above 13,000 feet and 12 peaks above 16,000 feet. Therefore, the answer is 11 + 12 = 23.;
Response:  Dennis has 15 toys in his bag and 18 pencils. So, he has a total of 15 + 18 = 33 items in his bag. Since each item takes up space, we need to calculate how many spaces each item occupies. For example, let's assume that each toy takes up 2 spaces (since there are 2 toys per row) and each pencil takes up 1 space (since there are 4 rows). Then, the total number of spaces occupied by all the items in Dennis's bag is:  Number of spaces occupied by toys = 2 x 15 = 30 Number of spaces occupied by pencils = 4 x 18 = 72 Total number of spaces occupied by all items = 30 + 72 = 102 Now, since there are 67 spaces available in the bag, we can see that Dennis has enough space for all his items. Therefore, the answer is 102.;
Response:  We know that January has 31 days and July has 30 days. So, if it is December 11th, then it will be January 17th after 6 months. Therefore, the correct answer is 31 + (6 x 30) = 246 days.;
Response:  We know that 7 x 3 = 21 and 21 / 3 = 7. So, there are 7 jigsaw pieces in total. Now we need to find out how many of them are blue. From the question, we know that 14 of the 21 pieces are blue. Therefore, there are 7 - 14 = 3 blue jigsaw pieces left. Finally, we know that Steevens has 15 pieces in total, including the blue ones. So, the number of blue jigsaw pieces he has is 3.;
Response:  We know that Jehangir visited 18 forts in 13 days. So, he must have covered each fort in approximately 1 day and 12 hours. Therefore, we can calculate the time taken to visit each fort as follows: Time taken = Number of forts x (Time per fort / Total number of days) Time taken = 18 x (13/13) = 18 x 1 = 18 days Now, let's find out how many days Jehangir spent at each fort. Since he visited 18 forts, he must have stayed at each fort for at least one day. Therefore, the total number of days Jehangir spent at each fort is equal to the number of forts minus the number of days he took to visit them. In this case, the total number of days Jehangir spent at each fort is 18 - 18 = 0 days. Hence, Jehangir did not spend any days at any of the forts.;
Response:  We know that ஜேக் ஸ்டீவன் (Jegan) has 3 friends who are also students of 8th standard. So, there are 3 x 8 = 24 students in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them have studied in Jegan's class. Since Jegan is in std 5, there are only 5 classes in std 5. Therefore, the number of students who have studied in Jegan's class is 24 / 5 = 4. So, 4 students have studied in Jegan's class.;
Response:  We know that Jegan has 12 pets and he wants to give 11 of them to Geetha. So, we have 12 - 11 = 1 pet left with Jegan. Now, out of these 12 pets, 4 are cats. So, we have 4/12 = 0.33 (or 1/3) cats left with Jegan. Therefore, Jegan has 1 cat left with him.;
Response:  We know that 7 x 3 = 21 and 9 x 4 = 36. So, we can write: ஜேக் ஸ்டீவன் விட 7 குறைவான பீச் மற்றும் ஜில் விட 9 அதிக பீச் உள்ளது. ஸ்டீவன் 16 பீச் உள்ளது.  Therefore, the product of Jeck and Steev is 21 x 16 = 320.;
Response:  We know that Jehangir has 7 horses and 8 elephants. So, in total he has 7 + 8 = 15 animals. Now we are asked how many dogs Jehangir has. Since Jehangir has only one dog, the answer is 1 dog. Therefore, the correct answer is 15 (animals) + 1 (dog) = 16.;
Response:  We know that Jehangir has 9 horses and 18 elephants. So, he has a total of 27 animals (9 + 18 = 27). Now, we are asked how many horses Jehangir has. Since Jehangir has 9 horses, he does not have any more than 9 horses. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jehangir visited six places in India and each place has 18 artifacts. So, the total number of artifacts he saw is: 6 x 18 = 108. Now, let's consider how many artifacts Jehangir would have seen if he had visited all the 32 places mentioned in the passage. The passage states that there are 32 places where Jehangir did not visit. If he had visited all these places, he would have seen an additional 32 x 18 = 576 artifacts. Therefore, the total number of artifacts Jehangir saw during his travels in India is: 108 + 576 = 684.;
Response:  We know that Jehangir has 5 fingers in each hand and 10 toes. So, he has a total of 5 x 2 = 10 digits.  Now, we are told that Steevens has 18 fingers. Therefore, Steeven has 18 x 2 = 36 digits. Finally, we are asked how many digits Jehangir has if Steeven has 87 fingers. To find this out, we need to divide the number of digits possessed by Steeven (36) by the number of fingers he possesses (87). This gives us an answer of 4.29 digits per finger.;
Response:  We know that Jehangir has 16 horses and Steevens has 15 jewels. If Jehangir gives 3 horses to Steeven, then Jehangir will have 13 horses left (16 - 3 = 13). Now, if Steeven gives 12 pearls to Jehangir, then Steeven will have 15 jewels left (15 - 12 = 3). So, the final number of horses Jehangir has is 13, and the final number of jewels Steeven has is 3. Therefore, the answer is 13 + 3 = 16.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 jacks in total and each jack has 3 pegs. So, the number of pegs is 12 x 3 = 36 pegs. Now, we know that 79 sticks are available for each jack, so the number of sticks per jack is 79 / 12 = 6.58 sticks (round off to 6 sticks). Therefore, there are 6 sticks per jack.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 Steevans and 9 Peeshs. So, we have to find out how many pairs of Steevan and Peesh are possible. To do this, we need to divide the total number of Steevan (3) by the number of Peeshs (9). This gives us 0.375 or 3/9. Therefore, there are 3 pairs of Steevan and Peesh.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 jacks and 8 pegs in total. Each jack can hold either 3 or 4 pegs, so we have a total of 6 x 3 = 18 pegs that each jack can hold. Since there are 8 pegs in total, some of them must be held by more than one jack. Therefore, the number of pegs held by each jack is at least 2 (since each jack holds at most 4 pegs). So, the minimum number of jacks required to hold all the pegs is 8 / 2 = 4.;
Response:  We know that Jehangir has 3 big boxes and 10 small boxes. Each big box contains 4 items, and each small box contains 2 items. So, in total, Jehangir has 3 x 4 = 12 items from the big boxes and 10 x 2 = 20 items from the small boxes. Now, we are asked how many items Jehangir has in total. To find this, we need to add the number of items he has from both the big and small boxes. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 20 = 32 items.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 peas in a jar and 4 of them are green. So, the number of green peas is 4 x 12 = 48. Now, we need to find out how many white peas are left after removing 67 red peas from the jar. The total number of peas in the jar before removing any peas was 12 + 4 (green) = 16. Therefore, the number of white peas left in the jar after removing 67 red peas is 16 - 67 = -51. So, the final answer is -51.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 students in the class and 12 of them have passed their exams. So, the number of students who haven't passed is 6 (18 - 12). Now, we need to find out how many of these 6 students got 8 or more passes. To do this, we can divide the total number of passes (12) by the number of students who haven't passed (6), which gives us an average of 2 passes per student (12 / 6 = 2). Therefore, 8 out of the remaining 6 students got 8 or more passes.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 peas in a jar and 12 of them are green. So, the number of green peas in the jar is 12. Now, we need to find out how many yellow peas are in the jar. According to the question, there are 72 peas in total, including both green and yellow ones. Therefore, the number of yellow peas in the jar is 72 - 12 = 60. So, the final answer is 60 yellow peas in the jar.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 peas in a jar and 6 of them are green. So, the number of green peas is 6. Now, we have to find out how many yellow peas are left after taking 3 jars. Since each jar contains 3 peas, the total number of yellow peas left is 3 x 3 = 9. Therefore, the final answer is 6 + 9 = 15.;
Response:  We know that there are 84 apples in a jar and 10 of them are rotten. So, the number of good apples is 74 (84 - 10). Now, we have to find out how many bags of 52 apples each are present in the store. Since there are 74 good apples, we can divide them equally among 52 bags, resulting in 1.4 bags per bag (74 / 52 = 1.4). Therefore, there are 13 bags of 52 apples each in the store (1.4 x 52 = 72).;
Response:  We know that there are 13 apples in total and 8 of them are red. So, the number of green apples is 13 - 8 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 jewels in Jack's box and 10 stones in each of the 3 bags. So, the total number of stones is: 8 + (3 x 10) = 42 stones. Now, we need to find out how many stones are in each bag. From the problem statement, we know that there are 11 apples in Bag A, 18 peaches in Bag B, and 15 pears in Bag C. Since each apple represents 2 stones, each peach represents 3 stones, and each pear represents 4 stones, we can convert these fruits into stones as follows:  Bag A has 11 apples, so it contains 22 stones (11 x 2). Bag B has 18 peaches, so it contains 54 stones (18 x 3). Bag C has 15 pears, so it contains 60 stones (15 x 4). Therefore, the total number of stones in all three bags together is: 42 + 54 + 60 = 156 stones.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 visible planets and 4 invisible planets. So, the total number of planets is 7 (3 + 4). Now, we need to find out how many planets Jupiter can see.

Response:  We know that there are 41 children in the village and 18 of them are in the town. So, the number of children who are not in the town is 23 (41 - 18). Now, we need to find out how many of these 23 children are in the mountain. To do this, we can divide the remaining children (23) by the number of children who are in the mountain (10). Therefore, the number of children who are in the mountain is 23 / 10 = 2.3. Since we cannot have a fraction of a child, the final answer is 2 children who are in the mountain.;
Response:  If there are 21 children in the village and they all go to school, then there will be 21 x 5 = 105 students in the school.  Among them, 16 are from the village.

Response:  We have 5 children who can play together in the park. Among them, 4 are boys and 1 is a girl. So, there are 4 boys and 1 girl playing together in the park. Now, let's assume that each boy has 2 friends, and each girl has 3 friends. Therefore, we have 4 x 2 = 8 boys playing with their respective friends, and 1 x 3 = 3 girls playing with their respective friends. In total, we have 8 + 3 = 11 children playing in the park.;
Response:  Firstly, there are 36 children in the village who have been given sweets.  Among them, 68 children come to the village from other places. Out of these, some of them return home and some stay back in the village. Therefore, the number of children who stayed back in the village is 12. So, the total number of children who went to the village and returned home or stayed back is 54 (68 - 12).;
Response:  We have 22 children in the first group and 40 children in the second group. Among them, 8 children are absent from the second group (as mentioned in the question). So, the number of children present in both groups is: 22 + 40 - 8 = 50 children. Therefore, out of 50 children, 2 children are absent (as mentioned in the question), so the remaining 48 children attend school.;
Response:  We know that there are 28 children in the village who have passed their exams and got selected for further studies. Out of these, 82 children from the same village did not get selected. So, the number of children who did not get selected is 82 - 28 = 54. Therefore, out of 100 children from the village, 30 (54/2) children did not get selected for further studies.;
Response:  We know that there are 23 children in the group and they divided into two groups of 12 each. So, the number of children who went to the park with their parents is 12 x 2 = 24.

"Response:  Peckar has 13 keys and he gave 91 people 154 new keys. So, the number of keys given to each person is:
Number of keys given to each person = Number of keys given by Peckar / Total number of people
= 154 / 91
= 1.67 (approximately)
Therefore, Peckar gave approximately 1.67 keys to each person.";
"Response:  The first person has 170 keys and distributes them among 78 people in such a way that each person gets at least 3 keys. So, the number of keys each person gets is:

Number of keys = Total number of keys / Number of people
= 170 / 78
= 2.25

So, the last person will get 2 keys (since we can't give fractional keys). Therefore, the final distribution of keys is:

Person 1: 1 key
Persons 2-78: 2 keys each
Person 79: 1 key

Therefore, the total number of keys distributed is:

Total number of keys = Person 1 + Persons 2-78 + Person 79
= 1 + (2 x 78) + 1
= 171

Answer: 171";
Response:  The first person has 75 keys and gives 25 to the second person. So, the second person now has 75 + 25 = 100 keys. Then, the second person gives 30 keys to the third person. So, the third person now has 100 + 30 = 130 keys. Now, the third person gives 40 keys back to the second person. So, the second person now has 130 - 40 = 90 keys left. Therefore, the final number of keys with the first person is 75 + 25 = 100 keys.;
Response:  The first person has 71 keys and gives 111 of them to the second person. So, the second person now has 182 (111 + 71) keys in total. Now, if the second person gives 50 of those keys back to the first person, then the first person will have 132 (71 + 50) keys left. Therefore, the answer is 132.;
Response:  Peck has 149 keys and 91 pens. If he gives away 10 keys and 90 pens, then he will have 139 keys and 81 pens left. So, out of the remaining 10 keys and 90 pens, he can make 10 x 9 = 90 pens and 10 x 81 = 810 keys. Therefore, the total number of pens and keys that Peck can make is 90 + 810 = 900 pens and 10 + 81 = 91 keys.;
Response:  Peck has 7 keys and 148 pesetas. He gave 15 keys and 103 pesetas to someone else. So, he has 7 - 15 = 6 keys left with him. And he has 148 - 103 = 45 pesetas left with him. Therefore, the number of pesetas that Peck has left is 45.;
Response:  We know that Peck has 126 keys and 48 pens. So, he must have given away 78 keys (126 - 48 = 78). Now, we are asked how many keys Peck gave away after giving away all his pens. Since he gave away 78 keys earlier, he must have given away another 37 keys (78 - 48 = 37) to make a total of 115 keys given away. Therefore, the answer is 115.;
Response:  We know that Peck has 19 keys and 131 pesos. He spent 70 keys and 88 pesos to buy something. So he had 129 pesos left (131 - 70 = 61). Now we need to find out how many pesos were in each key. To do this, we divide the number of pesos by the number of keys. In this case, we have 61 pesos / 19 keys = 3.26 pesos per key. Therefore, Peck spent approximately 3.26 pesos for each key.;
Response:  We know that 157 - 169 = -12. So, if we subtract 147 from 158, we get -11. Therefore, the number of eggs left after 158 eggs and 147 peckers is -11.;
Response:  We know that Peck has 54 keys and 143 pesetas. So, he has a total of 197 items (54 + 143). Now, we need to find out how many pesetas each key is worth.

Response:  Peck has 56 pecks in total and 124 eggs to share among his friends. If he wants to give each friend an equal number of eggs, then he will have to divide them equally among his 104 friends. So, each friend will get 12 eggs (104 / 12 = 9). Now, let's see how many eggs are left for Peck after giving them away. He had 56 pecks initially, and now he has given away 12 eggs per friend, so he has 56 - 12 x 104 = 38 pecks left. Therefore, Peck has 38 pecks of eggs left after sharing them with his friends.;
Response:  Peck has 52 pests and 84 keys. If he gives away 102 keys and 94 pecks, how many keys will he have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of keys given away from the total number of keys he had. So, the answer is 102 - 84 = 18 keys.;
Response:  We know that Peck has 134 pets and 11 cats. So, we have to find out how many dogs are left after giving 92 pecks of food to both the dogs and cats.

Response:  We know that there are 67 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a year is 67 x 24 = 1608 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Avvai spent in cooking food for her family during one year. According to the question, she spent 12 hours every day cooking food for her family. Therefore, the total number of hours she spent in cooking food for her family during one year is 12 x 365 = 4380 hours. Finally, we subtract the total number of hours Avvai spent in cooking food from the total number of hours in a year to get the remaining time which can be used for other activities like farming or taking care of her children. So, the answer is 1608 - 4380 = -2772 hours.;
Response:  The man has 74 pairs of socks and he gives away 71 pairs to others. So, he has 3 pairs of socks left with him. Now, if he distributes these 3 pairs among 51 days, he will have 0.6 pairs of socks per day (3/51). Therefore, the correct answer is 0.6 pairs of socks per day.;
Response:  The number of days in a year is 365 (or 366 in leap years). So, if someone has 76 pairs of pants and gives away 10 pairs every day for 76 days, they will have given away a total of 76 x 10 = 760 pairs of pants. However, since they gave away 64 pairs of pants on one particular day, that means they had 76 - 64 = 12 pairs of pants left over after giving away all the other pairs. Therefore, the person has 12 pairs of pants left at the end of the 76-day period.;
Response:  The man has 28 days to complete 52 tasks. This means he can complete one task in approximately 1.83 days (28/52). Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for him to complete all 52 tasks.  We know that there are 7 weeks in a month, and we have already calculated that there are 4 weeks left after completing 52 tasks. So, the number of days left = Number of days in a week x Number of weeks left = 7 x 4 = 28 days. Therefore, the man will need 28 days to complete all 52 tasks.;
Response:  The man has 82 pairs of socks and 61 pairs of shoes. In total, he has 143 pairs of footwear. Now, let's calculate how many days it would take for him to wear each pair once.  For socks, it takes 25 days since there are 82 pairs and he wears one pair per day. Therefore, the number of days it would take for him to wear each pair of socks is 25.  Similarly, for shoes, it takes 20 days since there are 61 pairs and he wears one pair per day. So, the number of days it would take for him to wear each pair of shoes is also 20.  Hence, in total, it would take him 25 + 20 = 45 days to wear all his footwear once.;
Response:  If he took 31 days to complete 45 tasks, then each task would take him approximately 1 day and 18 hours (31/45). However, if he completed 24 tasks in 24 days, then each task would take him approximately 1 day (24/24). Therefore, there are 45 - 24 = 21 additional tasks that he could have completed within those 45 days.;
Response:  If he has 44 pairs of socks and gives away 25 pairs, then he will have 19 pairs left (44 - 25 = 19). Now, if he gives away another pair, he will have 18 pairs left (19 - 1 = 18). So, in total, he will give away 19 + 1 = 20 pairs of socks.;
Response:  If he has 5 pairs of socks and each pair contains 7 socks, then he has in total 35 socks (5 x 7 = 35). Now, if he wants to give away 74 socks, it means that he will have 39 socks left after giving them away (74 - 35 = 39). So, the answer is 39.;
Response:  The man has 54 pairs of socks and he gives away 18 pairs in one day. So, after one day, he will have 36 pairs of socks left (54 - 18 = 36).;

Response:  If Abhi has 25 pairs of shoes and he gives away 5 pairs, then he will have 20 pairs of shoes left (25 - 5 = 20). Now, if he gives away another 73 pairs of shoes, then he will be left with 0 pairs of shoes (20 - 73 = 0). So, after giving away 73 pairs of shoes, Abhi will not have any shoes left.;
Response:  The man has 65 pairs of socks and he gave away 46 pairs to his friend. So, he has 29 pairs of socks left. Now, let's calculate how many days it took him to give away all those socks. He gave them away in 6 months, which is equal to 30 days per month. Therefore, he gave away 1 pair of socks every 30 days. Hence, the number of days it took him to give away all the remaining socks is:  Number of days = Total no. of socks / No. of socks given away per day = 29 / 1 = 29 days.;
Response:  If he has 41 pairs of shoes and gives 86 pairs to someone, then he will have 41 - 86 = -45 pairs of shoes left. So, the correct answer is -45.;
Response:  If he has 71 pairs of shoes and gives away 60 pairs, then he will have 11 pairs left (71 - 60 = 11). So, there are 11 pairs of shoes that he did not give away.;
Response:  The girl has 12 apples and wants to share them equally among her friends. So, she will have 1 apple per friend. Now, there are 11 friends in total, so she will have 11 apples left after sharing them with her friends. Therefore, the number of apples she has left is 11 - 1 = 10.;
Response:  Jessica has 7 apples and she gives one to her friend. So now Jessica has 6 apples left. Her friend has 1 apple from Jessica. Now let's consider Kamal. If he takes an orange from his bag, then he will have 15 oranges in total (including the one he already had). So, the final number of oranges that Kamal has is 15. Therefore, the answer is 6 for Jessica and 15 for Kamal.;
Response:  Jessica has 7 apples and she gives 2 to her friend. So, now Jessica has 7 - 2 = 5 apples left. Her friend has 2 + 1 = 3 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples they have between them is 5 + 3 = 8 apples.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 11 apples and 15 oranges in total. Now, if she wants to share them equally among her three friends, each friend will get how much?  To find out, let's divide the total number of fruits (11 + 15) by 3 = 7. So each friend will get 7 apples and 7 oranges. But wait! There is one more thing to consider - Jesse herself wants to eat some fruits too! Let's say she eats 2 apples and 3 oranges. Now, how many fruits are left for her friends?  To find out, let's subtract the fruits Jesse ate from the total number of fruits available = 7 - 2 = 5 apples and 7 - 3 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Jesse's three friends will have 5 apples and 4 oranges each.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 3 appears in the given sequence of numbers. We can see that the number 3 appears twice in the sequence, so the answer is 2 x 3 = 6. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The second part of the question asks us to find out how many times the number 12 appears in the given sequence of numbers. We can see that the number 12 appears once in the sequence, so the answer is 1 x 12 = 12. Therefore, the final answer is 6 + 12 = 18.;
Response:  If Jesse has 19 apples and gives 3 to Emily, then Jesse has 16 apples left (19 - 3 = 16). Now, if Emily has 18 oranges and gives 4 to Jesse, then Emily has 14 oranges left (18 - 4 = 14). So, the final number of apples that Jesse has is 16, and the final number of oranges that Emily has is 14. Therefore, the answer is 16-14=2.;
Response:  Jessy has 19 apples and she gives 3 to her friend. So, now Jessy has 16 apples left (19 - 3 = 16). Now, she buys 4 more apples, so she has 20 apples in total (16 + 4 = 20). Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jessy had before giving any apple to her friend and the number of apples she has after buying 4 more apples is 4 (20 - 16 = 4).;
Response:  Jessie has 10 fingers and each finger is 2 cm long. So, the total length of all her fingers is 2 x 10 = 20 cm. Now, we need to find out how much longer Jessie's longest finger is compared to her shortest finger. We know that Jessie's longest finger is 3 cm longer than her shortest finger, so let's call the length of her shortest finger x cm. Then, we can write an equation based on this information: Length of Jessie's longest finger = x + 3 cm. Substituting this value into the previous equation gives us: 20 cm = x + 3 cm. Solving for x, we get: x = 17 cm. Therefore, the length of Jessie's shortest finger is 17 cm.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 10 fingers and each finger is equal to 4 cm in length. So, the total length of all his fingers is 10 x 4 = 40 cm. Now, we are asked how much longer Jesse's hand would be if he had an extra finger. Since one finger is equal to 4 cm, then adding one more finger would make his hand 40 + 4 = 44 cm long. Therefore, Jesse's hand would be 44 cm long if he had an extra finger.;
Response:  The length of Jesse is 18 cm and her arm span is 4 cm. So, the distance between her elbow and wrist is 4 cm + 20 cm = 24 cm. Now, we need to find out how much of this distance is covered by each finger. Since there are 5 fingers in total, let's divide the distance equally among them. Therefore, each finger covers a distance of 24/5 = 4.8 cm.;
Response:  The teacher said that each student will get $ 23 for their participation in the competition. If there are 10 students participating, then each student will receive $ 23 x 10 = $ 230. Therefore, the total amount of money that the students will receive is $ 230.;
Response:  We know that Reshma has 3 T-shirts and each T-shirt costs $ 51 dollars. So, in total, she spent $ 153 on T-shirts. Now, we need to find out how many T-shirts she bought with $ 51. To do this, we divide the amount she spent on T-shirts ($ 153) by the cost of one T-shirt ($ 51). Therefore, Reshma bought 3 T-shirts with $ 51.;
Response:  The first person invested $87 in Apple stock and earned $950 profit. Then they invested half of their profit (i.e., $48.50) in Amazon stock and earned another $236 profit. Finally, they invested half of their remaining profit ($118) in Google stock and earned $578 profit. Therefore, the total profit made by this person is $950 + $236 + $578 = $1764.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Reshma has 3 shirts and each shirt costs $106. So, in total, she has spent $328 on shirts. Now, let's consider Arjun's case. He has 242 t-shirts and each t-shirt costs $10. Therefore, he has spent a total of $2420 on t-shirts. Now, if we subtract the amount that Arjun has spent from the amount that Reshma has spent, we get $2072 ($2420 - $328). So, the difference between the amount that Arjun has spent and the amount that Reshma has spent is $2072.;
Response:  The first set of 40 students scored an average score of 98 dollars per test. Since there are 163 tests in total, each student took approximately 4.05 tests (163 / 40 = 4.05).  If we assume that each test costs 20 dollars, then the total cost for all 163 tests would be  (4.05 x 20) = 809 dollars.  Now, let's calculate how much each student paid for each test. To do this, divide the total number of tests taken by the number of students. In this case, it is 163 tests divided by 40 students, which equals 4.05 tests per student. Therefore, each student paid ($809 / 4.05) = $202.27 for all 163 tests combined.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Reshma has spent Rs. 78 on TechShirt and Rs. 30 on Arkan's Shirt. So, the total amount she has spent is Rs. 78 + Rs. 30 = Rs. 108. Now, we are given that there are 186 TechShirts in total. Since Reshma has bought 172 of them, the remaining number of TechShirts left is 186 - 172 = 14. Therefore, the number of TechShirts that each person will get is 14 / 5 = 2.8. However, since we can't have a fraction of a shirt, the final answer is 2 TechShirts per person.;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Reshma has 183 t-shirts and 31 jeans to sell.  Now, let's calculate the total revenue from these items. The price of each t-shirt is $62, and the price of each jean is $99. So, the total revenue from selling all 183 t-shirts would be:

$62 x 183 = $11,546

Similarly, the total revenue from selling all 31 jeans would be:

$99 x 31 = $3,079

Now, let's add both these amounts to get the total revenue:

$11,546 + $3,079 = $14,625

Therefore, the total revenue for Reshma's business is $14,625.";
Response:  Reseller price of Tesla cars is $67 per dollar and that of Jaguar cars is $165 per dollar. If there are 74 Tesla cars and 156 Jaguar cars sold, then the total revenue from these sales will be:  Total Revenue = Number of Cars x Price Per Dollar  Total Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165  Total Revenue = $48,980 + $259,400  Total Revenue = $308,380 So, the total revenue from selling both Tesla and Jaguar cars is $308,380.;
Response:  The total number of T-shirts and jeans are given as follows: Total T-shirts = 157 Total Jeans = 19 So, we have to find out how many pairs of each can be made using these numbers. To do this, we need to divide the total number of each item by 2 (since each item comes in two pieces - one for the front and one for the back). Therefore, Total T-shirt Pairs = 157 / 2 = 78.5 Total Jean Pairs = 19 / 2 = 9.5 Now, let's see what happens when we multiply the number of pairs with the cost per pair. For T-shirts, the cost is $192, so the total cost of 78.5 pairs would be $192 x 78.5 = $146,025. Similarly, for jeans, the cost is $34, so the total cost of 9.5 pairs would be $34 x 9.5 = $316. Thus, the total cost of making all these clothes would be $146,025 + $316 = $146,341.;
Response:  Reseller price = $ 86 x 254 = $ 21,996  Tech support price = $ 232 x 43 = $ 9,706 Total cost = $ 21,996 + $ 9,706 = $ 31,692 So one tech support person can handle 31,692 devices.;
Response:  The cost of one Tesla is $51 thousand and there are 130 Teslas in total. So, the total cost of all Teslas is $6.43 million ($51 x 130). Now, we need to find out how much each Tesla costs per unit. To do this, we divide the total cost of all Teslas by the number of Teslas. In this case, the cost per unit is $6.43 million / 130 = $50,000 per Tesla. Therefore, each Tesla costs $50,000.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Reshma spent Rs. 201 on t-shirts and Arjun spent Rs. 217 on t-shirts. So, the total amount spent by both of them is Rs. 201 + Rs. 217 = Rs. 418. Now, they received a discount of 14 t-shirts each, which means they got 14 x Rs. 201 = Rs. 2856 as discount. Therefore, the final amount paid by Reshma and Arjun is Rs. 418 - Rs. 2856 = Rs. (-2438).;
Response:  We know that Arjun has $ 60 to spend on Tech products and he wants to buy at least one product worth $ 10 or more. So, we can say that Arjun will have enough money to buy at least one product worth $ 40 ( $ 60 - $ 10). Now, let's assume there are three different Tech products available in the market with prices of $ 30, $ 40, and $ 50 respectively. Since Arjun has only $ 40 to spend, he can buy either the $ 30 or $ 40 product but not the $ 50 product. Therefore, the answer is $ 30 or $ 40.;
Response:  We know that Arjun has 5 TechShirt designs worth $ 215 each. So, the total value of all 5 TechShirts is $ 215 x 5 = $ 1075. Now, we need to find out how much each TechShirt costs. To do this, we divide the total value of all 5 TechShirts by the number of TechShirts: $ 1075 / 5 = $ 215 per TechShirt. Therefore, each TechShirt costs $ 215.;
Response:  Reseller price of each watch is $5 and $215 for Tesla and Apple Watch respectively. So total resale value of all watches = (Number of watches x Resale price) = ($20 x $5 + $64 x $215). Therefore, total resale value = $3780.;
Response:  Reservoir capacity is 76 tanks and 204 wells in Jericho. Each tank can hold 30 cubic meters of water, and each well can provide 20 cubic meters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water that can be stored in Jericho is: 76 x 30 = 2280 cubic meters + 204 x 20 = 4080 cubic meters = 6360 cubic meters. Now let's calculate how much water is available for irrigation. Since there are 158 fields and 2 gardens, we need to divide the total water storage by the number of fields and gardens. The total area of all fields and gardens is 158 + 2 = 160 hectares. So, the amount of water available for irrigation per hectare is: 6360 / 160 = 40 cubic meters per hectare.;
Response:  Reservoir capacity is 210 TMC and Techerty has 240 TMC water supply. So, there will be a shortage of 30 TMC (240 - 210 = 30) in Techerty. Now, let's consider the distribution of water among different areas. Arkanas has 177 TCMC water supply and 23 Jerry cans per household, which means each household has 7.5 TMC water supply (177 / 23 = 7.5). Similarly, Dectechas has 23 Jerry cans per household, which means each household has 6.9 TMC water supply (23 / 2 = 6.9). Therefore, the total amount of water required to fill one jerrycan is 0.75 TMC (for Arkanas) or 0.69 TMC (for Dectechas).;
Response:  The total number of dollars in Resharp's account is $115 + $25 = $140.  Since each dollar can buy 1/6 of an iPhone, the total number of iPhones that Resharp and Teck can afford is $140 / 6 = 23 iPhones (Resharp can afford 113 iPhones and Teck can afford 78 iPhones). Therefore, one iPhone costs $140 / 23 = $6.09.;
Response:  The number of days in each month is as follows:  January - 31 days February - 28 or 29 days March - 31 days April - 30 days May - 31 days June - 30 days July - 31 days August - 31 days September - 30 days October - 31 days November - 30 days December - 31 days Total number of days = 365 days per year Now let's calculate how many times each person can go to the beach in a year: Person A has 5 weeks of vacation and 10 national holidays, so they can go to the beach 5 x 7 = 35 times Person B has 4 weeks of vacation and 10 national holidays, so they can go to the beach 4 x 7 = 28 times Person C has 3 weeks of vacation and 10 national holidays, so they can go to the beach 3 x 7 = 21 times Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that Person A can go to the beach the most (35 times), followed by Person B (28 times) and then Person C (21 times).;
Response:  We have 50 people who are equally divided into two groups of 25 each. Each group has to work for 12 hours in total (i.e., 480 minutes). Since there are only 24 hours in a day, one group must work during the night while the other works during the day. So, we can assign them as follows: Group A - Night shift (working from 6 PM to 6 AM) Group B - Day shift (working from 6 AM to 6 PM) Now, let's calculate how many days each person will work: For Group A: Total working hours = 12 hours x 50 people = 600 minutes Working days = Total working hours / 720 minutes per day = 8.33 days For Group B: Total working hours = 12 hours x 50 people = 600 minutes Working days = Total working hours / 720 minutes per day = 8.33 days Therefore, each person will work approximately 8.33 days in total.;
Response:  The number of people in each group is given as 3. So, there will be 3 x 9 = 27 people in total. Therefore, the answer is 27.;
Response:  The number of days in each month is given as follows:  January - 31 days February - 28 or 29 days March - 31 days April - 30 days May - 31 days June - 30 days July - 31 days August - 31 days September - 30 days October - 31 days November - 30 days December - 31 days Now let's count how many times each number appears in the list of months:  * 31 days: appeared 6 times (January, March, May, July, October, December) * 30 days: appeared 5 times (February, April, June, August, November) Therefore, there are 6 different numbers of days in the months listed.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, in total, there are 240 hours in a month (30 days x 8 hours/day). Now, we need to find out how many hours are left after subtracting the number of hours spent in meetings from the total number of hours in a month. To do this, we need to divide the number of hours spent in meetings by the number of days in a week. For example, if someone spends 5 hours in meetings per day, then they will spend 5 x 7 = 35 hours in meetings per week. If they have 10 weeks in a month, then they will spend 35 x 10 = 350 hours in meetings for the entire month. Therefore, the person will have 240 - 350 = 80 hours free in a month.;
Response:  The number of days in each month is given as follows:  January - 31 days February - 28 or 29 days March - 31 days April - 30 days May - 31 days June - 30 days July - 31 days August - 31 days September - 30 days October - 31 days November - 30 days December - 31 days Now let's count how many times each digit appears in the numbers of days for each month:  Digit 1 (one) appears 5 times (January, March, May, July, and September have 1 day). Digit 2 (two) appears 4 times (February has 29 days, and April, June, and November have 2 days each). Digit 3 (three) appears 3 times (April, July, and October have 3 days each). Digit 4 (four) appears twice (May has 4 days, and December has 4 days). Digit 5 (five) appears once (November has 5 days). Therefore, there are 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17 different numbers of days in each month.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 teams with 7 players each and 14 people in total. Each team plays for 3 minutes, so we have 3 x 4 = 12 matches in total. Since each match lasts for 3 minutes, the total time taken to complete all the matches is 12 x 3 = 36 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 36 minutes.;
Response:  The number of people who have been in the team for at least 14 years is 7 (A + B + C). Since there are 9 managers, each manager has worked with at most 2 teams (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the total number of teams that each manager has worked with is at most 9 x 2 = 18 teams. So, the total number of teams that all the managers together have worked with is 7 + 18 = 25 teams.;
Response:  The number of days in 460 weeks is given as 71 weeks per year. So, if someone works for 5 years, they will have worked for 355 weeks (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Therefore, the total number of working days during those 5 years would be:  Working Days = Total Number of Weeks x Number of Days per Week = 355 weeks x 7 days/week = 2,435 days Now, let's calculate how many weekends and holidays someone might have had during that period: Weekends = Total Number of Weeks x Number of Weekend Days per Year = 355 weeks x 2 days/week = 710 days Holidays = Total Number of Years x Average Number of Holidays per Year = 5 years x 10 days/year = 50 days So, the person has worked for 2,435 days and taken 710 days off for weekends and holidays, leaving them with 1,725 workdays.;
Response:  We know that there are 1216 days in 4 years. So, if someone invests $16 every day for 4 years, they will have $16 x 1216 = $19,384. Therefore, the person has earned $19,384 from investing $16 daily for 4 years.;
Response:  We know that there are 216 weeks in an year and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days in a year is 216 x 7 = 1532 days. Now, we need to find out how many days Loojis spent in his life time. According to the question, he lived for 702 years which means he spent 702 x 365 (days per year) = 248,950 days in his lifetime. Therefore, the difference between the total number of days in a year and the number of days Loojis spent in his lifetime is: 1532 - 248,950 = -247,408 days.;
Response:  The person has invested $1357 in 223 stocks for 73 months. To calculate the total profit, we need to find out the average price of each stock and multiply it with the number of shares he holds. So, let's first find the average price per share. We know that the person has invested $1357 in 223 stocks, so the total amount invested is $1357 x 223 = $298,643. Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of stocks he holds, which is 223. So, the average price per share is $298,643 / 223 = $1306.67. Now, let's calculate the total profit. Since the person held these stocks for 73 months, we can calculate the monthly profit by dividing the total investment by the number of months he held them. So, the monthly profit is $1306.67 / 73 = $176.35 per month. Therefore, the person made a profit of $176.35 per month or $1357 x 73 = $96,391 over the entire period.;
Response:  The person has Rs. 1091 in their account at the beginning of the year and they deposit Rs. 28 every month. At the end of the year, they have Rs. 939 in their account. So, the total amount deposited is Rs. 28 + (12 x Rs. 28) = Rs. 3576. Therefore, the person has Rs. 3576 more than what they had initially in their account.;
Response:  We know that there are 233 weeks in 1 year and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days in 1 year is 233 x 7 = 1635. Now, we need to find out how many days Luoyis spent on his trip. According to the question, he spent $403 on his trip, which means he spent approximately $2.5 per day (based on the exchange rate of $1 USD = $40 Indian Rupees). Therefore, the number of days Luoyis spent on his trip can be calculated as follows: Number of days = Total amount spent / Daily expenditure = 1635 / 2.5 = 650 days. So, Luoyis spent 650 days on his trip.;
Response:  The person has 1359 days in their lifetime and they have spent 368 days studying. So, the remaining time is 1001 days (1359 - 368 = 1001). Now, if he spends another 388 days studying, then the total number of days he will spend studying is 754 days (388 + 368 = 754). Therefore, the difference between the total number of days he spent studying and the number of days he had left in his lifetime is 253 days (754 - 1001 = -253).;
Response:  We know that the cost of living in Los Angeles is higher than in other cities. So, if someone earns $491 per month and has to spend it all on living expenses, they will have to be very careful with their money.  Firstly, let's calculate the total amount spent on housing. Since the person has to pay $1181 for rent every two weeks, the monthly rent comes out to be $1181 x 2 = $2362.  Next, we need to subtract the amount spent on housing from the total income. Therefore, the remaining amount after deducting the housing expense would be: $491 - $2362 = -$1871. This means that the person does not have enough money left over after paying for housing to cover any other expenses such as food, transportation, or entertainment. In fact, they are actually in debt by an amount of $1871!;
Response:  We are given that there are 19 years in Varahagiri's life and he has earned $133 million during those years. Now we need to find out how much money he made per year. To do this, we divide the total amount of money he earned ($133 million) by the number of years he lived (19 years). So, the annual income of Varahagiri is: $$ \therefore \text {Annual income of Varahagiri} = \frac{\$133\text{ million}}{\$19\text{ years}} = 7 \times 10^5 \text{ dollars/year} $$;
Response:  If Lily spends $2 per hour and works for 4 hours, she will spend $8. Now, if she earns $178 in total, that means she has earned $170 after subtracting the amount spent on working ($8). So, her profit is $170 - $8 = $162.;
Response:  If Oyvind's friends took 10 minutes to reach him after he called them, then they were at a distance of 10 x 60 = 600 meters from him. Since they ran at a speed of 5 km/h, it would take them 600 / 5 = 120 minutes to reach him. Therefore, they will arrive at his location after 120 minutes have passed since Oyvind called them.;
Response:  We know that டீன் (Ten) has 8 fingers and ரான் (Rain) has 14 fingers. So, if we add their number of fingers, we get 22. Therefore, the answer is 22.;
Response:  The number of people who are not interested in watching TV is 50% of 100 = 50.  Among them, 11 people do not watch TV at all. So, the remaining 49 people watch TV for an average of 12 minutes per day. Therefore, the total time spent watching TV by all the people is 49 x 12 = 588 minutes per day.;
Response:  We know that Oyvind's height is 180 cm and he has lost 15 cm in 15 days. So his current height is 165 cm. Now we need to find out how much of Ran's height is equivalent to Oyvind's current height. Since Ran is 175 cm tall, if we divide his height by the number of days Oyvind lost height (15), we get an estimate of how much of Ran's height is equivalent to Oyvind's current height. Therefore, 175 cm / 15 = 11.25 cm. So, approximately 11 cm of Ran's height is equivalent to Oyvind's current height.;
Response:  The teacher said that the students had to find out how many times the number 10 appeared in the series of numbers given below: 25, 47, 80, 113, 136, 169, 192, 225, 256, 289, 322, 355, 388, 421, 454, 487, 520, 553, 586, 619, 652, 685, 718, 751, 784, 817, 850, 883, 916, 949, 982, 1015, 1048, 1081, 1114, 1147, 1180, 1213, 1246, 1279, 1312, 1345, 1378, 1411, 1444, 1477, 1509, 1542, 1575, 1608, 1641, 1674, 1707, 1740, 1773, 1806, 1839, 1872, 1905, 1938, 1971, 2004, 2037, 2070, 2103, 2136, 2169, 2202, 2235, 2268, 2291, 2324, 2357, 2390, 2423, 2456, 2489, 2522, 2555, 2588, 2621, 2654, 2687, 2720, 27;
Response:  The length of the river is 9 miles wide and it takes 15 minutes to cross it by boat. If there are 6 boats available for crossing, how many people can cross the river in total? Solution: To find out how many people can cross the river in total, we need to divide the width of the river (in miles) by the number of boats available for crossing. In this case, we have: Width of river = 9 miles Number of boats = 6 So, we can calculate the number of people who can cross the river per boat as follows: Number of people per boat = Width of river / Number of boats Now, let's substitute the values we know into the formula: Number of people per boat = 9 / 6 = 1.5 people per boat Therefore, if there are 6 boats available for crossing, we can accommodate a total of 6 x 1.5 = 9 people across the river in one trip.;
Response:  Brain has given 34 options to choose from and he wants to select only two of them. So, we have to divide 34 by 2 = 17. Now, out of these 17 options, Brain can select any 2 that he likes. Therefore, there are 17 x 2 = 34 possible combinations.;

Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Brahman has 27 Vedas and 80 Upanishads. If each Veda contains an average of 1,000 mantras (verses), then Brahman has 27 x 1,000 = 27,000 mantras in total. Similarly, if each Upanishad contains an average of 500 verses, then Brahman has 80 x 500 = 40,000 verses in total. Therefore, the total number of mantras and verses contained within Brahman is 27,000 + 40,000 = 67,000.;
"Response:  Brahman is said to have created 9 universes (Prabhasa), each with its own set of deities and beings. These 9 universes are known as Vaikuntha, Kshiroda, Sutala, Atala, Vitala, Nara, Patala, Mahatala, and Kanaka. Each universe has its own unique characteristics and features, such as different types of living beings, plants, and minerals. In addition to these 9 universes, there are also 46 other lower realms or ""pits"" (Talas) where beings experience suffering due to their karma. So in total, Brahman is said to have created 55 universes or realms. However, it is important to note that these numbers may vary depending on the tradition or interpretation of Hindu scriptures.";

"Response:  Brain has 28 different types of cells called neurons that process information and send signals to other parts of the brain or body. These neurons are organized into different layers in the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain responsible for processing sensory information and controlling movements. Each layer contains a specific type of neuron with unique properties and functions. For example, layer 4 contains pyramidal cells that receive input from other neurons and pass it on to other layers or output it directly to muscles or glands. Layer 5 contains interneurons that perform complex computations within their own network before passing the signal on to other layers or outputs. There are many more subtypes of neurons within each layer based on their morphology (shape), physiology (function), and connectivity patterns with other neurons. Therefore, there are hundreds if not thousands of distinct types of neurons in just one small region like primary visual cortex V1 alone! So when we say ""there are 28 different types of neurons"" what really means is that these 28 categories represent broad generalizations across multiple levels - from individual cells all way up through entire organs like brains themselves - but still leave plenty room for variation & diversity within those broad categories too";
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Brahman is the creator of the universe and has created many universes. Each universe has its own unique characteristics and features. In each universe, there are multiple deities who are responsible for maintaining and governing their respective universes.

Response:  Mahesh has 31 cows and he gives 5 of them to his 5 friends. So, now Mahesh has 26 cows left (31 - 5 = 26). Now, each friend gets 4 cows from Mahesh, so Mahesh gives away 4 x 5 = 20 cows (26 - 20 = 6). Therefore, there are 6 cows remaining with Mahesh after giving them away to his friends.;
Response:  There are 4 people in Maththaiyan's family.  Each person has at least one finger (ignoring toes). Therefore, there are at least 4 x 5 = 20 fingers in total among all four members of Maththaiyan's family. Now, let's consider each member of Maththaiyan's family separately. For simplicity, assume that each person has exactly 10 fingers (again ignoring toes). So, for Maththaiyan himself, we have 10 fingers. Similarly, his wife has 10 fingers, and their two children together have 10 fingers as well. In total, then, we have 4 x 10 = 40 fingers among Maththaiyan and his family members. However, this is not enough to cover all 32 cricketers and 98 keys mentioned in the puzzle. To do so, we need additional fingers beyond those belonging to Maththaiyan and his family. Specifically, we need an additional 32 - 4 = 28 fingers to account for the cricketers, since each cricketer requires 28 fingers to hold their bat, ball, and other equipment. Moreover, we need an additional 98 - 4 = 94 keys to account for the keys that were lost. Since each key requires only 1 finger to open it, we need a total of 94 fingers to account for these lost keys. Thus, the final tally of fingers among Maththaiyan and his family, plus the cricketers and lost keys, comes out to be: 40 + 28 + 94 = 162 fingers!;
Response:  There are 4 people in Maththaiyan's family and each of them has 3 children, so there are 12 children in total. Now, out of these 12 children, 5 are boys and 7 are girls.

Response:  Teacher asks Debbie to draw six circles in one day. Each circle has 12 sectors, and each sector takes 30 minutes to complete. How many hours will Debbie take to finish all six circles? Solution: To find out how many hours it will take Debbie to finish all six circles, we need to calculate the total time required for her to complete all 72 sectors (6 circles x 12 sectors per circle). Since each sector takes 30 minutes to complete, the total time required is:  Total Time = Number of Sectors x Time per Sector = 72 x 30 = 2160 minutes  Therefore, Debbie will take 2160 minutes or 36 hours to finish all six circles.;
Response:  We know that there are 95 days in total and we have to find out how many days each of them will be spent on different activities.  Based on the information given in the question, we can see that:  • Teepi spends 15 days in total on different activities.  • She spends 5 days on cooking, 3 days on cleaning, and 7 days on other activities.  Therefore, she will spend 15 days x (number of days spent on each activity) = 15 x (5 + 3 + 7) = 62.5 days on these activities.  Now, let's calculate the number of days Teepi will spend on each activity separately:  • Cooking: 5 days / 15 days = 0.33 or 33% of her time.  • Cleaning: 3 days / 15 days = 0.2 or 20% of her time.  • Other activities: 7 days / 15 days = 0.46 or 46% of her time.  So, Teepi will spend approximately 33% of her time on cooking, 20% of her time on cleaning, and 46% of her time on other activities.  As for Ravi, he spends 180 days in total and his breakdown is as follows:  • He spends 10 days on cooking, 10 days on cleaning, and 70 days on other activities.  Therefore, he will spend approximately 10% of his time on cooking, 10% of his time on cleaning, and 70% of his time on other activities.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 360 degrees in a full circle and 162 teeth in each of the two gears. So, if one tooth from the smaller gear meshes with every three teeth from the larger gear, then how many times will the smaller gear rotate for one rotation of the larger gear? Solution:  To find out how many times the smaller gear rotates for one rotation of the larger gear, we need to divide the number of teeth in the smaller gear (122) by the number of teeth that mesh with each other (3). Therefore, the smaller gear rotates 40.67 times (122/3) for one rotation of the larger gear.;

Therefore, the remaining number of kumis for each helicopter is 50 - 30 = 20 kumis.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 months in a year and each month has 30 days. So, the total number of days in a year is 4 x 30 = 120 days. Now, we have to find out how many days each of the 23 gods can take rest for. Each god takes rest for 15 days, so they will be able to take rest for (23 x 15) = 325 days. Since there are only 120 days in a year, it means that some of the gods will not be able to take rest for their full quota of 325 days. Therefore, the remaining number of days that the gods will not be able to take rest is (120 - 325) = -105 days.;
Response:  We have 13 big elephants and 50 small elephants in total. Each big elephant can carry 4 small elephants, so we have 13 x 4 = 52 small elephants that each big elephant can carry. Since there are 26 kumis (a type of boat) available, we need to divide the number of small elephants that each big elephant can carry among the kumis. Therefore, the number of small elephants that each kumi can carry is 52 / 26 = 2. So, each kumi can carry 2 small elephants.;

Based on the information provided earlier, each bag of rice weighs 50 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the bags of rice that Praang could have packed in one day can be calculated as follows: 14,572 hours / 30 minutes (as mentioned in the question) = 459 bags of rice per day So, Praang could have packed 459 bags of rice per day.;
Response:  We know that Praang has written 555 letters to his friend and he wants to send them in 220 days. So, we need to calculate how many letters he can write per day.  To do this, we divide the total number of letters (555) by the number of days (220):  Number of letters per day = Total number of letters / Number of days = 555 / 220 = 2.5 letters per day Now, let's assume that each letter takes him 1 hour to write. Therefore, the time taken to write one letter is 1 hour.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time taken to write one letter to minutes: Time taken to write one letter = 1 hour / 60 minutes = 0.017 hours or 1 minute and 7 seconds per letter Now, let's calculate the total time taken for Praang to write all the 555 letters: Total time taken to write all letters = Number of letters x Time taken to write one letter = 555 x 1 minute and 7 seconds = 8.39 hours This means that Praang will take approximately 8 hours and 21 minutes to write all the 555 letters if he writes one letter every day for 220 days.;

Response:  We know that there are 17 pairs of socks in total and 9 pairs have holes. So, the number of pairs of socks without holes is 17 - 9 = 8 pairs. Now, we need to find out how many socks each pair has. Since there are 29 socks in total, each pair of socks without holes has 29 / 8 = 4 socks. Therefore, the number of socks each pair of socks without holes has is 4 socks.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 days in April and May combined (April has 30 days and May has 31 days). So, if we subtract 19 days from 60 days, we get 41 days left. Therefore, the number of days remaining after deducting 19 days from 60 days is 41 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 72 pairs of socks in total and each pair has 32 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of socks is 72 x 32 = 2248. Now, we have to find out how many pieces of socks are left after giving 78 pairs to the people. To do this, we need to subtract the number of socks given away (78) from the total number of socks (2248). Therefore, the number of pieces of socks left after giving them away is 2248 - 78 = 2169.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 melons in total and each melon has 80 seeds. So, the total number of seeds is 36 x 80 = 2880 seeds. Now, we also know that out of these 2880 seeds, 54 are defective or bad seeds. Therefore, the remaining good seeds are 2880 - 54 = 2826 seeds.;
"Response:  We know that there are 30 questions in total and out of them, 28 questions have been answered correctly. So, the number of incorrect answers is 2. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many questions did he get wrong?"" is 2.";
Response:  We know that there are 4 types of candy and each type has 10 pieces in total. So, the total number of candies is: 4 x 10 = 40. Now, we need to find out how many pieces of each type of candy there are. Let's assume that the number of pieces of each type of candy is given by a sequence of numbers in which each number represents the number of pieces of that type of candy. For example, if the first number in the sequence is 3, then there are 3 pieces of the first type of candy. Similarly, if the second number in the sequence is 5, then there are 5 pieces of the second type of candy, and so on. Based on this assumption, we can write an equation for the total number of pieces of each type of candy as follows: Total Number of Pieces of First Type of Candy = 3 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 29 Total Number of Pieces of Second Type of Candy = 5 + 7 + 9 + 3 = 34 Total Number of Pieces of Third Type of Candy = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 Total Number of Pieces of Fourth Type of Candy = 2 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 23 Therefore, the total number of pieces of all four types of candy is: 29 + 34 + 8 + 23 = 104 Finally, we need to subtract the number of pieces of each type of candy that were already eaten (which is 79) from the total number of pieces to get the remaining number of pieces: 104 - 79 = 25 So, there are 25 pieces of each type of candy left.;
Response:  We know that there are 57 pairs of socks in total and each pair has two socks. So, the number of individual socks is 57 x 2 = 114. Now, we need to find out how many laced socks (Sodal) and unlaced socks (Taid) are present among these 114 socks. According to the question, 26 pairs of socks have been laced, which means they have been tied together with thread or yarn. Therefore, the number of laced socks is 26. Similarly, we can calculate the number of unlaced socks as follows: The remaining 88 socks are not laced, so they are unlaced. Hence, the number of unlaced socks is 88. Thus, the final answer is: Laced socks - 26 Unlaced socks - 88;
Response:  We have 81 pairs of shoes and we want to distribute them equally among 60 people. So, each person will get 1.35 shoes (81/60). Now, let's consider the situation where some people got more than one pair of shoes. In that case, we need to subtract the number of extra shoes from the total number of shoes. Therefore, the remaining shoes after distribution are 81 - (60 x 1.35) = 21 shoes.;
Response:  We know that there are 49 pairs of socks in total and each pair has 2 socks. So, the number of socks is 49 x 2 = 98. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes are there. According to the question, there are 40 pairs of shoes and each pair has 2 shoes. Therefore, the number of shoes is 40 x 2 = 80. Finally, we have 6 pairs of laces which means there are 6 x 2 = 12 laces in total.;

Response:  We know that there are 703 people who have not taken any action to help the poor in the previous year. Among them, 246 people did not take any action for 25 days. So, the number of people who did not take any action for at least 1 day is 246.;
Response:  If there are 400 people in the room and each person has to give a speech for 3 minutes, then how many total speeches will be given?  There will be 400 x 3 = 1200 speeches given in total. Now, if 666 people gave speeches in the previous year, then how many people did not give speeches in that year?  The number of people who did not give speeches is 666 - 400 = 266 people. Therefore, among the 100 people present in the current year, 26 people did not give speeches in the previous year.;
Response:  The first person to get infected with COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. So, the number of people who got infected with COVID-19 before January 2020 is 1.  In January 2020, there were 50 cases reported worldwide. Therefore, the number of people who got infected with COVID-19 before February 2020 is 51 (1 + 50).  In February 2020, there were 80 cases reported worldwide. Hence, the number of people who got infected with COVID-19 before March 2020 is 131 (51 + 80).  In March 2020, there were 200 cases reported worldwide. So, the number of people who got infected with COVID-19 before April 2020 is 331 (131 + 200).  In April 2020, there were 406 cases reported worldwide. Thus, the number of people who got infected with COVID-19 before May 2020 is 737 (331 + 406).  Finally, as per the question, 406 people got infected with COVID-19 in May 2020. Therefore, the total number of people who got infected with COVID-19 before June 2020 is 777 (737 + 40).;
"Response:  The number of people who attended the meeting yesterday is given as 45.  If we assume that each person attending the meeting has an average of 7 friends (which may not be accurate), then the total number of people who were informed about the meeting would be:

Number of people attending the meeting x Number of friends per person = 45 x 7 = 315

So, there are approximately 315 people who were informed about the meeting.";
Response:  The number of people who were present at the meeting is given as 71 in the first statement and then reduced to 557 in the second statement. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 640 (71 - 557). So, the number of people who were absent from the meeting is 640.;
Response:  Avargal (people) have a good habit of saving money every month. They save Rs. 500 per person as their monthly savings. Now, there are 40 people in this group who saved money for 39 months continuously. So, the total amount saved by them is: 40 x 39 = 15600 rupees. But then, they decided to increase their savings amount to Rs. 700 per person from the next month onwards. So, the number of people who could save money for 661 days (which includes the previous 39 months) would be: 661 / 700 = 928 people. Therefore, out of the total 40 people, 928 - 40 = 928 people could save money for 661 days.;
"Response:  The first year (419 people) had 103 survivors, and each subsequent year had fewer survivors than the previous year. So, we can create a pattern like this: Year 1: 419 people, 103 survivors; Year 2: 418 people - 103 = 315 survivors; Year 3: 417 people - 315 = 102 survivors;... Therefore, the number of survivors after 9 years is: Year 9: 416 people - 102 = 314 survivors.";
Response:  The first year there were 471 participants and in the next year, 808 participants joined. So, if we want to find out how many people participated in the event after 89 years, we can use the formula: Total number of participants = (Initial participants x Growth rate) ^ Number of years. In this case, the growth rate is 1.63 times (since there are 808 participants in the second year compared to 471 in the first year). Therefore, the total number of participants after 89 years would be: Total number of participants = (471 x 1.63)^89 = 89,352,041.;
Response:  The number of people who attended the meeting yesterday is given as 191.  Of these, 70% attended the previous day's meeting, which means that 130 people attended both meetings (70% of 191).  Therefore, the number of people who did not attend either meeting is 61 (191 - 130).  So, the number of people who attended only one of the two meetings is 61 + 130 = 191.;
Response:  Avatar has 159 grams of gold and he wants to distribute it equally among 628 people. So, each person will get (159/628) = 0.247 grams of gold.;
Response:  The man has 49 grains of rice in his bowl and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 9 grains of rice (49/5 = 9). Now, there are 288 grains of rice left over after distributing them equally among 5 people. Therefore, each remaining grain of rice represents 10 grains of rice (288/5 = 10). Hence, the man has 260 grains of rice left over after distributing them equally among 5 people (260 = 10 x 28).;
Response:  The person has 57 grams of gold and wants to buy an item worth 353 grams. So, he needs to pay $353 - $57 = $296 for the item. Therefore, the answer is $296.;
Response:  We know that the man has 166 grams of rice in his bag and he wants to distribute it equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 33 grams of rice (166/5). Now, we are asked how much rice the man himself will get if there are 20 more grams left after distributing it among the 5 people. Therefore, the man will get 20/5 = 4 grams of rice (since there are 20 more grams left).;
"Response:  Avatar's age is given as 557 years old in the question. If he has lived for 557 years and has spent 17 of those years (as mentioned in the question) doing nothing but eating, then his total number of meals consumed would be:

Number of meals = Age x Time spent eating
= 557 x 17
= 9293 meals
Therefore, Avatar has consumed 9293 meals during his lifetime.";
Response:  We know that 11 grams of rice is equal to 0.492 kilograms (since there are 11/2 = 5.5 kilograms in 1 kilogram). So, if we have 11 grams of rice, it means we have 0.00492 kilograms of rice. Now, let's convert this amount to grains. Since there are 160 grains in 1 gram of rice, we can calculate the number of grains as follows: Number of grains = Amount of rice / Grain weight = 0.00492 kg / 0.16 g = 30.7 grains Therefore, if we have 11 grams of rice, we have approximately 30.7 grains of rice.;
Response:  The man has 94 trades in his stock market portfolio and he wants to sell 90 of them. So, if we assume that each trade is equal to one share, then the total number of shares he wants to sell is 90. Now, let's calculate the value of these shares based on their current price. If the price of each share is $100, then the total value of the 90 shares he wants to sell is $9000 ($100 x 90). But, as per the question, he only has $8000 in his account, which means he doesn't have enough money to buy back all the shares he wants to sell. Therefore, the answer is -$1000 (-$9000-$8000).;
Response:  The number of people who have been in jail for more than 1 year is 266. Now, out of these 266 people, how many will be released from jail after one year? To find this, we need to divide the total number of people in jail by the number of years they have spent in jail. So, if it takes 90 days to complete 1 year in jail, then each day represents 0.3 months (90/90). Therefore, the number of people who will be released from jail after 1 year is: Number of people in jail x Time spent in jail / Total time taken to complete 1 year in jail = 266 x 0.3 / 0.3 = 85.3 people. So, approximately 85.3 people will be released from jail after 1 year.;
Response:  The number of people who have been to Tirupati is 244 million. Out of them, 47 million have taken darshan without break (muuntriikkal). So, the total number of people who have taken darshan with breaks is 294 million. In 146 years, there will be approximately 1058 million people taking darshan with breaks.;
Response:  We know that there are 100 peahens and 221 peacocks in total.  Of these, 77 are males. So, the number of females is 100 - 77 = 23. Therefore, out of 300 days, 23 days will be suitable for mating (i.e., 23 / 300 x 100 = 7.67%).;
Response:  We know that there are 57 questions in total and each question has 10 options to choose from. Therefore, the number of possible answers is 57 x 10 = 570. However, we also know that out of these 570 possibilities, only 252 are correct answers. So, the probability of getting a correct answer is (252/570) x 100 = 43.9%.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 judges in total and they have to give verdicts for 8 cases per day. So, the number of verdicts given by all the judges in one day is 36 x 8 = 288. Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take for all the judges to give verdicts for 240 criminal cases. Since each judge gives 8 verdicts per day, it will take 240 / 8 = 30 days for all the judges to give their verdicts. Therefore, the answer is 30 days.;
"Response:  We know that there are 26 minutes in an hour and 52 weeks in a year. So, if we have to calculate the number of hours in 52 weeks, we need to divide the total number of minutes in a week by the number of minutes in an hour. Therefore, the number of hours in 52 weeks is:

Number of hours = Total minutes in a week / Number of minutes in an hour
= 1440 (total minutes in a week) / 60 (number of minutes in an hour)
= 23,333.33 hours
So, there are approximately 23,333.33 hours in 52 weeks.";
Response:  We know that there are 40 students in Avvaiyar's class and each student has to bring two books for the library. So, the total number of books brought by all the students is: 40 x 2 = 80 books. Therefore, Avvaiyar has 80 books in her bag.;
Response:  We know that there are 56 mines in total and out of them, 10 are coal mines. So, the number of non-coal mines is 56 - 10 = 46. Now, we need to find out how many villages are associated with each mine. There are 39 villages associated with each non-coal mine. Therefore, the total number of villages associated with all 46 non-coal mines is 39 x 46 = 1744.;
Response:  We know that there are 74 mines of coal and 22 mines of iron ore in the area. So, the total number of mines is 74 + 22 = 96 mines. Now, we need to find out how many mines are under each valley. From the question, we come to know that there are 46 valleys in the area. Therefore, the number of mines under each valley is 96 / 46 = 2 mines per valley. So, the answer is 2 mines per valley.;
Response:  Avatar has 15 minutes of fame and 62 minutes of infamy. Each minute of fame is equivalent to 0.03 hours ( since there are 15 minutes in an hour). Similarly each minute of infamy is equivalent to 0.03 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours of fame for avatar is : 15 x 0.03 = 0.45 hours  The total number of hours of infamy for avatar is: 62 x 0.03 = 1.86 hours. So the difference between the total number of hours of fame and infamy for avatar is: 1.86 - 0.45 = 1.41 hours.;
Response:  Amma is 39 years old and has 13 toes. So, she has 13 x 5 = 65 toes in total.;
Response:  Amma is 66 years old and has 3 daughters. Each daughter has 10 sons-in-law. So, in total, there are 3 x 10 = 30 sons-in-law. Now, let's calculate how many grandchildren each son-in-law has. Since each son-in-law has 2 daughters, they have 2 x 2 = 4 grandchildren in total. Therefore, the number of grandchildren that Amma has is 30 (sons-in-law) x 4 (grandchildren per son-in-law) = 120 grandchildren.;
Response:  Amma has 28 toys and she wants to distribute them equally among 56 children. So, each child will get 28/56 = 0.49 toy. Therefore, there will be 0 toy left over after distributing all the toys.;
Response:  Amma has 57 veils and she distributed them among 34 people. So each person got 1.62 (57/34) veils on average.;
Response:  Amma is 51 years old and has 3 children. She works as a teacher in a school. Her husband passed away when she was pregnant with her third child. Now, let's calculate how much money she would have earned during these 20 years.  As a teacher, she earns an average salary of Rs. 40,000 per month. So, over 20 years, she would have earned a total of Rs. 960,000 (Rs. 40,000 x 20 months).  But, unfortunately, she had to spend a lot of money on her husband's treatment and hospital bills during his last illness. She spent around Rs. 200,000 for that purpose. Therefore, the actual amount of money she saved is Rs. 760,000 (Rs. 960,000 minus Rs. 200,000).;
Response:  Amma has 70 years old and she can walk 14 steps per minute. So, in one minute, she can walk 70/60 = 1.167 steps (approximately). Now, let's calculate how many steps she can take in 3 minutes.  In 3 minutes, Amma can walk 1.167 x 3 = 3.501 steps approximately.;
Response:  We have 4 pegs and 36 holes in each peg. So, there are 36 x 4 = 144 holes in total. Now, we need to find out how many unique combinations of 4 holes can be formed using these 144 holes. To do this, we can use combinatorics. The number of ways to choose 4 holes from 144 holes is given by C(144, 4) = 280. Therefore, there are 280 unique combinations of 4 holes that can be formed using the 144 holes provided.;
Response:  If you have 33 coins and want to distribute them equally among 11 people, each person will get 3 coins (3 x 11 = 33). So, there is no need to give any extra coin to anyone. Therefore, the answer is 33 coins for all 11 people.;
Response:  If there are 41 apples in one basket and we add 5 more baskets with 4 apples each, then the total number of apples will be:  41 + (5 x 4) = 41 + 20 = 61 apples. So, there will be 61 apples in total.;
"Response:  We have 14 coins and we want to divide them equally among 7 baskets. So, each basket will get 2 coins (14 / 7 = 2). Now, let's assume that in one of the baskets, there are already 3 coins. So, the total number of coins in all 7 baskets is 2 + 3 = 5 coins. Therefore, the remaining 9 coins will be divided equally among the other 6 baskets, which means each basket will get 9/6 = 1.5 coins. Since you cannot have a fraction of a coin, the last basket will get 1 whole coin. Hence, the final distribution of coins is as follows: Basket 1 - 2 coins; Basket 2 - 2 coins; Basket 3 - 2 coins; Basket 4 - 1.5 coins; Basket 5 - 1.5 coins; Basket 6 - 1.5 coins; Basket 7 - 1 whole coin.";
Response:  If there are 3 apples in one basket and we take out 21 apples from that basket, then how many baskets do we need to carry all those 21 apples?  We can see that each basket can hold 3 apples, so we will need 7 baskets (21 / 3 = 7) to carry all those apples. Therefore, the answer is 7 baskets.;
Response:  We have 26 letters in English alphabet and we need to find out how many words can be formed using these letters.  Since each word must contain at least one vowel, let's count the number of vowels first. There are 5 vowels in English - A, E, I, O, U. So, the total number of vowels is 5. Now, let's count the number of consonants. There are 21 consonants in English - B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. Therefore, the total number of consonants is 21. Now, let's calculate the number of words that can be formed using these letters. The formula for calculating the number of words is : Number of words = Total number of consonants x Total number of vowels For our case, it would be : Number of words = 21 x 5 = 105 words. So, there are 105 words that can be formed using the 26 letters of the English alphabet.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 pegs in total and each peg has 3 cups of rice. So, the total number of cups of rice is 14 x 3 = 42 cups. Now, we need to find out how many bags of rice are required to fill all these cups. There are 28 bags of rice available, so we can divide the total number of cups by the number of bags to get the answer. Therefore, the number of bags of rice needed to fill all the cups is 42 / 28 = 1.5 bags.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 thappads (palms) in each hand and each palm has 5 fingers. So, total number of fingers in both hands is 5 x 5 = 25 fingers. Now, we need to find out how many fingers are present in one finger space. Since there are 25 fingers in both hands, each finger space can accommodate 25 / 5 = 5 fingers. Therefore, there will be 5 fingers in one finger space.;
Response:  If there are 10 tokus in one toki, then there will be 10 x 9 = 90 kuppai arasuku (cups) in total. So, each toki has 9 cups. Therefore, if there are 20 tokus in one toki, then there will be 20 x 9 = 180 kuppai arasuku in total. So, each toki has 9 cups again.;
Response:  We have 6 houses and each house has 24 rooms. So, in total we have 6 x 24 = 144 rooms. Now, one person can occupy only one room, so there are 144 people who can occupy these rooms. Therefore, the number of people who can stay in all six houses is 144.;

Response:  We have 20 houses in one tokuyi and each house has 32 tanks. So, we have total of 640 tanks (20 x 32). Now, there is one balloon seller who wants to sell his balloons to all these households. If he can sell 3 balloons per household, then he will be able to sell a total of 1920 balloons (640 households x 3 balloons/household). Therefore, the answer is 1920.;
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 30 pieces of leather. Since there are 78 togs in total and each toga requires 30 grams of leather, we need to divide 30 grams by 78 togas to get the number of pairs of shoes that can be made. Therefore, the answer is 30/78 = 0.375 or approximately 1 pair of shoes per 2.64 togas. So, one person can make approximately 1 pair of shoes using 2.64 togas of leather.;
Response:  The person has 55 toothbrushes and wants to store them in 8 boxes. Each box can hold 4 toothbrushes. So, we need to divide 55 by 8 to find out how many boxes are needed.  We get: 55 / 8 = 7 Therefore, the person needs 7 boxes to store all their toothbrushes.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 kuppai (cups) and each cup has 81 tokus (balls). So, in total, we have 4 x 81 = 324 balls. Now, let's assume that each ball represents one task or work that needs to be done. Therefore, if there are 324 tasks to be completed, it means that each person will have 324 / 4 = 81 tasks to complete.;
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 16 pieces of cloth. To do this, we need to divide 16 by 2 (since each pair of shoes requires two pieces of cloth). So, there are 8 pairs of shoes that can be made from 16 pieces of cloth. Now, let's consider the remaining 8 pieces of cloth. Since there are 17 pieces of fabric in total, and we have already used 8 for making pairs of shoes, there are 9 pieces of fabric left over. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
"Response:  Rebecca has 4 groups of 10 people each and 2 groups of 20 people each. In total, she has 70 people in her group. Now, let's calculate how many different ways we can arrange these 70 people into 4 groups of 10 and 2 groups of 20.

For arranging 4 groups of 10 people each, there are C(70, 4) = 3500 possible combinations.

For arranging 2 groups of 20 people each, there are C(70, 2) = 140 possible combinations.

So, the total number of different ways to arrange Rebecca's group is 3500 + 140 = 3640.";
Response:  Rebecca has 5 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 0.5 bags of rice (5/10). Now, if there are 15 more people who need food, they will also get 0.5 bags of rice each (15/30). Therefore, the total number of bags of rice distributed is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 bag of rice.;
Response:  We have 11 circles and each circle has 2 mutts (or sectors). So, in total we have 22 mutt...;
Response:  Rebecca has 4 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 8 people. So, each person will get 1/2 bag ( half) of rice. Now, let's consider the remaining 6 bags of rice. Since there are 6 more people than the number of bags available, each person will get only 1/6th bag of rice. Therefore, the final answer is : 1/2 + 1/6 = 5/12.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 3 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 4 families. So, each family will get 1 bag of rice. Now, we are asked how many bags of rice does each family have in total. Since there are 15 muktai (smaller units) in one bag, each family has 15/4 = 3.75 muktais of rice in total. Therefore, the answer is 3.75.;
Response:  Rebecca has 6 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 18 people. To find out how many bags each person will get, we can divide the total number of bags by the number of people. So, 6 bags / 18 people = x bags per person. Since there are 72 grains in a bag, we can multiply the number of bags per person by the number of grains in a bag to find out how many grains each person will get. Therefore, x bags per person x 72 grains/bag = y grains per person. Now, since Rebecca has 66 kilograms of rice, we need to convert the number of grains into kilograms. There are approximately 500 grams in a kilogram, so we can divide the number of grains by 500 to get the weight in kilograms. Therefore, y grains/person x 500 grams/kilogram = z kilograms. Thus, the answer is z kilograms.;
Response:  Rebecca has 3 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 9 people. So, each person will get 1/3 x 9 = 3 bags of rice. Now, there are 27 kilograms of potatoes available, which is equal to 3 x 9 = 27 bags of potatoes. Each bag contains 50 kg, so the total weight of potatoes that can be distributed is 27 x 50 = 1350 kg. Therefore, each person will get 1350 / 9 = 148 grams of potatoes.;
Response:  Rebecca has 5 bags of rice and she wants to distribute them equally among 20 people. So, each person will get 1/20th of one bag of rice = 1/20 x 5 = 0.25 bag of rice. Now, let's find out how many bags of rice each person will get if there are 6 big bags of rice available. Each big bag contains 50 kg of rice, so 6 big bags contain 6 x 50 = 300 kg of rice. Since each person got 0.25 bag of rice earlier, they will now get 300 / 0.25 = 12 bags of rice per person. Therefore, the total number of bags of rice that Rebecca can give to the remaining 6 people is 6 x 12 = 72 bags of rice.;
Response:  Rebecca has 20 boxes of chocolates and each box contains 5 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, she has 20 x 5 = 100 pieces of chocolate.

Therefore, the number of boxes of chocolates that Rebecca gave to David is 12.;
Response:  We know that there are 154 boxes in total and each box contains 10 balls. So, we have 154 x 10 = 1540 balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many balls each of the 11 people got. To do this, we divide the total number of balls by the number of people. So, 1540 / 11 = 139 balls per person. Therefore, each of the 11 people got 139 balls.;
Response:  The person has 177 coins and wants to distribute them equally among 46 friends. To find out how many coins each friend will get, we can divide the total number of coins by the number of friends: Number of coins per friend = Total number of coins / Number of friends = 177 / 46 = 3.85 coins per friend Since there are no remainders when dividing by 46, each friend will receive exactly 3 coins.;
Response:  We have two triangles with 84 pieces each.  If we take one triangle and give it to someone else, that person will get 84 pieces of puzzle. Now, if we divide the remaining 79 pieces among 7 people, each person will get 11 pieces (79/7 = 11). So, the answer is 11.;
Response:  The person has 146 balls in total and he wants to divide them equally among his 157 friends. So, each friend will get an average of 93/157 = 0.6 balls per friend. Therefore, the person will have 146 / 157 = 0.9 balls left after dividing them all.;

Response:  Emili has 72 friends and each friend brings 3 dishes for lunch. So, in total, there will be 72 x 3 = 216 dishes. But, out of them, 6 dishes are already prepared by Emili herself, so we have 216 - 6 = 210 dishes left. Now, out of these 210 dishes, 3 dishes are not good enough to eat, so we have 210 - 3 = 207 dishes that Emili can serve to her friends.;
Response:  Emili has 43 friends and each friend gave her 5 gifts in total. Therefore, Emili received 5 x 43 = 215 gifts in total. However, she returned 20 of those gifts to her friends. So, the number of gifts that Emili kept is 215 - 20 = 195 gifts.;

Response:  We know that there are 819058 children in Kodai and 668278 of them have parents who work in Mukuami. So, we need to find out how many children do not have parents working in Mukuami. To do this, we can subtract the number of children with parents working in Mukuami from the total number of children in Kodai. Therefore, the answer is: Number of children without parents working in Mukuami = Total number of children in Kodai - Number of children with parents working in Mukuami = 819058 - 668278 = 150830.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 202958 children in Kodai Road and 777622 children in Vijayanagar. Now, if all the children from Kodai Road come to Vijayanagar, then the total number of children in Vijayanagar will be 777622 + 202958 = 980680 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children in Vijayanagar and the number of children who came from Kodai Road is 980680 - 777622 = 193058 children. So, out of 193058 children, 143058 are boys and 50000 are girls.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many children are there in Larans school. According to the question, there are 898051 students in Larans school and among them, 629424 are boys. So, the number of girls in Larans school is 898051 - 629424 = 278627. Now, let's consider the situation where all the girls in Larans school have 3 brothers each. In this case, the total number of brothers in Larans school would be 278627 x 3 = 836881. Therefore, the answer is 836881.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many children are there in total. From the question, we know that there are 313473 children in Kodai Road and 274865 children in Viduthalai Street. Therefore, the total number of children is: Total Number of Children = 313473 + 274865 = 588338 children. Now, let's calculate the percentage of children who have not received any vaccine. To do this, we will divide the number of unvaccinated children (i.e., those who are not immunized) by the total number of children. The number of unvaccinated children can be calculated as follows: Unvaccinated Children = Total Number of Children x Percentage of Unvaccinated Children So, if we assume that 10% of the children in Kodai Road and Viduthalai Street are unvaccinated, then the number of unvaccinated children would be: Unvaccinated Children = 588338 x 10% = 5883.38 children. Therefore, approximately 0.98% of the children in Kodai Road and Viduthalai Street have not received any vaccines.;

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34044 children in Kodai Road School and among them, 134867 have been enrolled in Vidhya Mandir. So, the number of children who haven't been enrolled in Vidhya Mandir is 34044 - 134867 = 20557. Now, out of these 20557 children, 424944 have been enrolled in Mukaami. Therefore, the number of children who haven't been enrolled in Mukaami is 20557 - 424944 = -42187. So, the answer to the question is -42187.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 610769 children in Kodaiyam village who have received vaccination against measles-rubella (MR). Among them, 590796 children have completed their full course of vaccination. Now, let's find out how many children did not complete their full course of vaccination among those who received MR vaccine. We can do this by subtracting the number of children who completed their full course from the total number of children who received MR vaccine. So, the number of children who did not complete their full course of vaccination is: Number of children who did not complete their full course = Total number of children who received MR vaccine - Number of children who completed their full course = 610769 - 590796 = 199873. Therefore, among the 610769 children in Kodaiyam village who received MR vaccine, 199873 did not complete their full course of vaccination.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 644997 children in Kodaiyamurthyil and 893835 children in Mugamalai. So, the total number of children in both areas is 644997 + 893835 = 1538232. Now, out of these, 78 children are from Mugamalai who have gone to Kodaiyamurthyil. Therefore, the remaining number of children in Mugamalai is 1538232 - 78 = 1530454.;

Response:  We know that there are 9 apples in Adim's bag and 10 apples in Jagan's bag. So, if we take an apple from Adim's bag, then he will have 8 apples left (9 - 1 = 8). Now, let's assume that Adim gives one of his apples to Jagan. So, Adim has 7 apples left (8 - 1 = 7), and Jagan gets one more apple, making it 11 apples in his bag (10 + 1 = 11). Therefore, the answer is 7.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 apples in the basket and 8 of them belong to Adim. So, the number of apples left for Jaggu is 2 (10 - 8 = 2).;
Response:  We know that there are 6 apples in total and 4 of them are left after Jaggu took some. So, the number of apples remaining with Adham is 6 - 4 = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2 apples.;

Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after taking 6 apples from the bag. To do this, we will subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34 apples left in the bag. Therefore, the answer is 34 apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 types of jaggery and each type has 89 grams of jaggery in it. So, the total amount of jaggery in all 5 types is: 5 x 89 = 445 grams. Now, we also know that there are 11 different types of appam available. Each type of appam contains 30 grams of rice flour. Therefore, the total amount of rice flour used to make all 11 types of appam is: 11 x 30 = 330 grams. So, the difference between the total amount of jaggery and the total amount of rice flour used is: 445 - 330 = 115 grams.;
Response:  Helena is 31 years old and has been working for 31 years. If she started work at age 28, then her current age is 59 (31 + 28).  Since she will retire in 10 years, her current age minus her retirement age is 41 (59 - 19). Therefore, Helena will retire at the age of 41.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helena has 90 sacks of wheat and 51 bags of rice.  Secondly, she also has 484 sacks of sugar cane. Now, let's calculate how many sacks of each item Helena has in total: Total number of sacks = Number of sacks of wheat + Number of sacks of rice + Number of sacks of sugar cane = 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 sacks So, Helena has 625 sacks of items in total.;
Response:  Helena had 527 sacks of wheat and gave 86 bags to her husband as his share. So, she has 554 sacks of wheat left. Now, let's calculate how many bags of wheat each of Helena's 3 children got from their mother. Since there are 86 bags in total that Helena gave to her husband, we can assume that each child got an equal number of bags (i.e., 86/3 = 28 bags). Therefore, Helena's three children together received 28 x 3 = 84 bags of wheat from their mother.;
Response:  Helena has 144 chess pieces and 397 pawns. She moves one piece at a time. If she moves a rook from row 2 to row 4, it will be in front of her queen (row 3). So, there are only two possible positions for the rook after moving - either in row 4 or in row 6. Similarly, if she moves a bishop from column 3 to column 5, it will be in front of her king (column 4). Therefore, there are only three possible positions for the bishop after moving - either in column 5, column 7, or column 9. Now let's count the number of possible positions for each piece: Rooks - 2 positions (row 4 and row 6) Bishops - 3 positions (column 5, column 7, and column 9) Knights - 2 positions (either side of the board) Queens - 1 position (middle of the board) King - 1 position (center of the board) Total number of possible positions = 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 possible positions.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helena had 19 cats and 231 dogs as pets. Now, she wants to give away some of her pets to her friends. So, let's assume she gave away x number of cats and y number of dogs to her friends. Since she has 237 cat silhouettes in total, if she gives away x cats, then the remaining cats are 237 - x. Similarly, since she has 468 dog silhouettes in total, if she gives away y dogs, then the remaining dogs are 468 - y. Therefore, the number of cats given away is x = 19 - (237 - x), and the number of dogs given away is y = 231 - (468 - y).;
Response:  Helena has 197 sacks of flour and 46 bags of sugar. She gives 75 sacks of flour and 66 sacks of sugar to each of her three children. How many sacks of flour does she have left after giving them away?  We can start by subtracting the number of sacks of flour given to each child from the total number of sacks of flour that Helena had: 197 - (3 x 75) = 197 - 225 = -38 sacks of flour.  So, Helena has -38 sacks of flour left after giving them away.;
Response:  Helena has 519 skirts and 300 blouses in her wardrobe. She also has 280 dresses and 359 tops. So, she has a total of 1348 pieces of clothing in her wardrobe.

"Response:  We know that there are 84 full-time employees and 19 part-time employees in total. Among them, 8 full-time employees and 69 part-time employees are women. So, among the remaining men (75), how many are full-time employees? To find this out, we can use the information given in the question: ""Among the remaining men, 30 are full-time employees."" Therefore, the number of full-time male employees is 30 + 75 = 105.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 62 full-time employees and 80 part-time employees in total.  Among them, 73 full-time employees and 41 part-time employees are males. So, the number of females among both full-time and part-time employees is 62 - 73 = 9 and 80 - 41 = 39 respectively. Therefore, the number of female employees is 9 + 39 = 48.;
Response:  The number of girls in Kedari's class is given as 57 and the number of boys in her class is given as 63. So, there are more boys than girls in the class. Therefore, the number of girls who have not received any gift from Kedari is greater than or equal to 57 - 63 = -6.;
Response:  We know that there are 57 full-time employees and 39 part-time employees in total. Among them, 34 full-time employees have left the company. So, the number of remaining full-time employees is 34 - 34 = 0. Therefore, all the employees who were previously full-time but are now part-time are 39 - 34 = 5.;
Response:  Fred is 60 years old and has $19 million in his bank account. Jesús is 33 years old and has $33 million in his bank account. To calculate how much money Jesús has after giving half of his money to Fred, we need to subtract the amount that Fred received from Jesús' total amount of money. Therefore, the answer is: $33 million - $19 million = $14 million.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 86 Dalals in one Frater (F). So, if there are 30 Fathers and 20 Mothers, then there will be 86 x 30 = 2520 people in total. Now, let's consider the Jesuits. Since they have 5 Dalals per Father, the total number of Jesuits will be 5 x 30 = 150. Therefore, the total number of people including both Fraters and Jesuits is 2520 + 150 = 2670.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 cars belonging to Fred and 16 cars belonging to Jesus. So, in total, they have 35 cars (19 + 16 = 35). Now, we need to find out how many cars each of them has. To do this, we divide the number of cars they have by the number of people they are. For Fred, it is 35 / 19 = 1.8 (approximately) cars per person. Similarly, for Jesus, it is 35 / 16 = 2.25 (approximately) cars per person. Therefore, the answer is 1.8 cars per person for Fred and 2.25 cars per person for Jesus.;
"Response:  We know that there are 114 dogs and 22 cats in the village. Each dog has 5 puppies, and each cat has 3 kittens. So, we have:

Dogs: 114 x 5 = 570 puppies
Cats: 22 x 3 = 66 kittens
Total: 570 + 66 = 636 pets.
Therefore, the total number of pets in the village is 636.";
Response:  Fred has 111 cars and Jesus has 40 cars. If we calculate the total number of cars owned by both Fred and Jesus together, it is 151 cars (111 + 40 = 151). Now, if we subtract the number of cars that Jesus owns from the total number of cars owned by both Fred and Jesus, we get 100 cars (151 - 40 = 100). Therefore, the difference between the number of cars owned by Fred and Jesus is 100 cars.;
Response:  Fred has 49 dogs and Jesus has 3 dogs. If we calculate the total number of dogs owned by both Fred and Jesus together, it is 52 dogs (49 + 3). Now, let's consider the cars. According to the passage, there are 112 cars in Fred's garage. However, since Jesus does not have any car, the total number of cars in Fred's garage after deducting Jesus' cars is 112 - 3 = 109 cars. Therefore, the difference between the number of dogs owned by Fred and Jesus is 52 - 3 = 49 dogs.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 78 farmers who have committed suicide and their families received compensation of Rs. 31 lakh each. Therefore, the total amount of compensation paid to these families is (78 x 31) = Rs. 2468 lakh. Now, let's consider the Jesuit order. We know that they have provided financial assistance to 14 farmer families who had lost their breadwinners due to suicides. The amount of financial assistance given to each family is not specified in the question. However, since it is mentioned that the Jesuits have provided financial assistance worth Rs. 90 lakh to 90 families, we can assume that the amount of financial assistance provided to each family is also Rs. 90 lakh. So, the total amount of financial assistance provided by the Jesuits is (14 x 90) = Rs. 1260 lakh. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by both the government and the Jesuits on providing compensation and financial assistance to the affected families is (Rs. 2468 lakh + Rs. 1260 lakh) = Rs. 3728 lakh.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 33 Dalals in Fred and 95 Dalals in Jesus. So, if we subtract the number of Dalals in Jesus from the number of Dalals in Fred, we get: 33 - 95 = -62. Therefore, the difference between the number of Dalals in Fred and Jesus is 62. Now, let's consider the amount of money that each Dalal has given to Fred. We know that out of 16 Dalals who gave money to Fred, 7 gave Rs. 100 each, and 9 gave Rs. 50 each. So, the total amount of money given by these 16 Dalals is: (7 x Rs. 100) + (9 x Rs. 50) = Rs. 840. However, this amount is less than the total amount of money received by Fred from all the Dalals, which is Rs. 1600. Therefore, the remaining amount of money that Fred did not receive from any of the Dalals is: Rs. 1600 - Rs. 840 = Rs. 760.;
Response:  We know that Fred has 47 dogs and Jesús has 99 cats. So, in total, they have 47 + 99 = 146 pets. Now, we are asked how many of these pets are dogs. Since there are 47 dogs among them, the number of dogs is 47 / 146 x 100 = 32%. Therefore, out of all the pets owned by Fred and Jesús, 32% are dogs.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse is 71 years old and has 20 kilos of gold. Now, let's calculate how much money he can get from selling his gold. If we assume that the price of one gram of gold is around Rs.500, then Jesse's total gold weight is 20 kg x 1000 grams = Rs.20,00,000 (approximately). So, if Jesse sells all his gold, he will get Rs.20,00,000.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 27 kilos of gold and he wants to give it to Sarah as a gift. Now, Sarah is 101 kilos heavier than Jesse, so she will get 101 + 27 = 128 kilos of gold from Jesse. Therefore, the weight of gold that Jesse gave to Sarah is 128 kilograms.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 126 kilograms of gold and he wants to give 66 kilograms to his friend. So, the remaining amount of gold with Jesse is 60 kilograms (126 - 66 = 60). Now, let's find out how much money Jesse will get from selling those 60 kilograms of gold at the rate of Rs. 50 per gram. We know that there are 10 grams in one gram, so the total weight of gold that Jesse will sell is 600 grams (60 kg / 10 g). Therefore, the amount of money Jesse will get from selling those 600 grams of gold is Rs. 30,000 (600 g x Rs. 50/g).;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse is 35 years old and has 69 kilograms of weight. Now, let's calculate his BMI (Body Mass Index) using the formula: BMI = Weight (in kg) / Height (in meters) squared. So, BMI = 69 / (1.7 m)^2 = approximately 24.8. Therefore, Jesse's BMI falls under the category of ""Underweight"".";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 114 kilos of gold and he wants to sell it in two parts - 50 kilos each. So, the total weight of both parts is 114 kg x 2 = 228 kg. Now, let's calculate the value of each part based on the price per gram of gold given in the question. We know that the price of gold per gram is Rs 3000. So, the total value of 50 kilos of gold at this price is 50 kg x Rs 3000/kg = Rs 150,000. Similarly, the total value of 60 kilos of gold at this price is 60 kg x Rs 3000/kg = Rs 180,000. Therefore, the total value of all the gold that Jesse has is Rs 150,000 + Rs 180,000 = Rs 330,000.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 9 kilos of gold and he gave 62 kilos to Jack in the first transaction. So, Jesse had 62 - 9 = 53 kilos of gold left after giving it to Jack. Now, in the second transaction, Jesse gave 140 kilos of gold to Jack. So, Jesse had 53 + 140 = 193 kilos of gold left after giving it all to Jack. Therefore, the amount of gold that Jesse had after giving it all to Jack is 193 kilos.;
Response:  Firstly, Jesse gave away 56 kilos of gold in the first round and received 99 kilos of gold as return. So, there is a profit of 43 kilos of gold (99 - 56 = 43). Now, let's calculate the percentage of profit. Profit Percentage = (Profit / Original Amount) x 100% Profit = 43 / 56 x 100% = 78% Therefore, Jesse made a profit of 78%.;
Response:  We have 95 balls in total and 61 of them are red. So, there are 34 blue balls (95 - 61 = 34). Therefore, out of 64 blue balls, 20 will be odd numbers (64 / 34 = 20).;
Response:  We have 93 pairs of shoes and 97 socks in total. Now, let's assume that each pair of shoes has one left shoe and one right shoe (i.e., 2 shoes per pair). Therefore, we have 93 x 2 = 186 shoes in total. Similarly, since each sock is paired with another sock, we have 97 x 2 = 194 socks in total. So, there are 186 shoes and 194 socks in total. As for whether any of the first 40 students got both left and right shoes or not, it depends on how the distribution was made. If all 40 students received only one shoe each (i.e., no student got both left and right shoes), then none of them got both left and right shoes. Otherwise, some of the students might have gotten both left and right shoes.;
Response:  We have 3 big rocks and 75 small stones in the mirror room. If we add 82 pebbles to this mixture, there will be a total of 160 objects in the room (3 big rocks + 75 small stones + 82 pebbles). Now, if we remove 19 of these objects from the room, there will be 141 objects left (160 - 19 = 141). So, the remaining objects are 141.;
Response:  We have 79 eggs in total and we need to distribute them equally among 24 boys and 51 girls. So, each boy will get 3 eggs (79 / 24) and each girl will get 5 eggs (79 / 51). Therefore, there are 3 + 5 = 8 eggs left over after distribution.;
Response:  The man had 171 toothbrushes and gave away 134 of them. So he has 37 toothbrushes left now.;
Response:  The man had 160 toothbrushes and gave away 56 of them yesterday. So he has 104 toothbrushes left now. If he gives away 41 more today, then he will have 63 toothbrushes left (104 - 41 = 63).;
Response:  The man has 90 toothbrushes and he uses each one for 154 days. So, in total, he will use 13620 (90 x 154) toothbrushes. However, after 50 years, he will have used 781000 (13620 x 50) toothbrushes. Therefore, the number of toothbrushes the man will have left is 781000 - 90 = 772000.;
"Response:  We know that there are 175 toothpicks and 77 urulai (small pieces of wood). So, if we want to find out how many toothpicks can fit in each urulai, we need to divide the number of toothpicks by the number of urulaies.  Therefore, the number of toothpicks that can fit in one urulai is:

Number of toothpicks per urulai = Number of toothpicks / Number of urulaies
= 175 / 77
= 2.3
So, approximately 2.3 toothpicks can fit in one urulai.";
Response:  We know that there are 177 tulips and 12 urinals in total. Out of these, 53 tulips were given to him. So, the number of tulips he got is 53 / 177 = 0.30 (or 30%) of the total number of tulips. Similarly, the number of urinals he got is 12 / 177 = 0.07 (or 7%) of the total number of urinals. Therefore, the ratio of tulips to urinals received by him is 30 : 7 or 3 : 1.;
Response:  The person has 105 toys and 71 small balls. If he gives 137 toy cars to his friend, how many toys will he have left? So, the number of toys he will have left is: 105 - 137 = -32 Toys. Therefore, the correct answer is -32 toys.;
Response:  If there are n marbles in the jar initially and each time a marble is drawn out, one less marble remains in the jar. So after drawing out m marbles, there will be n - m marbles left in the jar. Now, if we draw out another marble from the remaining marbles, then there will be n - (m + 1) marbles left in the jar. Therefore, the number of times the jar can be emptied completely is n - 1.;
Response:  The number of people who have visited Jan's house is given as 17. Out of these, 8 are children. So, the number of adults who have visited Jan's house is 17 - 8 = 9. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  We are given that there are 11 swallows in total and each swallow can carry 3 bugs at most. So, the total number of bugs carried by all the swallows is 11 x 3 = 33 bugs. Now, we are asked how many bugs Jan can carry. Since Jan is one of the swallows, he can carry up to 8 bugs as per the information provided. Therefore, the number of bugs carried by Jan is 8.;
Response:  The number of good cars in John's collection is 15 and the number of bad cars is 5. So, the total number of cars in his collection is 20 (15 + 5). Therefore, the answer to the question is 20.;
"Response:  The given statement is ""வீட்டின் சுவர்களுக்கு யோவான் பெரிய மரத்தடியைப் பயன்படுத்தினான்."" which means ""The person who has the most beautiful hair in the world is John."" Now let's analyze the information provided in the question:  * வீட்டின் சுவர்களுக்கு - This phrase means ""the hair of the people in the video""  * யோவான் - This word means ""John""  So, based on the information provided in the question, we can conclude that John has the most beautiful hair in the world among all the people in the video. Therefore, the answer to the question is 16 (the number of palakai John has).";
Response:  If we take 74 as the number of days for which John has been working at his current job, and he earns $10 per hour, then his total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total Earnings = Number of Hours worked x Hourly Wage Total Earnings = 74 x $10 Total Earnings = $740 Now, if we subtract the amount that John spends on groceries from his total earnings, we get: Amount Spent on Groceries = Total Earnings - (Groceries Cost) Amount Spent on Groceries = $740 - (Cost of Groceries) So, the amount spent on groceries is $740 minus the cost of groceries, which we don't know. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be determined with certainty.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two types of people in this world - those who like sweet and those who like sour. Now, let's assume that each person can be classified into one of these categories based on their taste preferences.  Next, we need to determine how many people belong to each category. Based on our previous knowledge, we know that 14 out of every 100 people prefer sweet things, while 25 out of every 100 people prefer sour things. So, if we have 100 people in total, then the number of sweet-taste lovers would be 14/100 = 0.14, and the number of sour-taste lovers would be 25/100 = 0.25.  Finally, we need to find out which type of person is more likely to enjoy Janas's food. To do this, we simply divide the number of sour-taste lovers (0.25) by the total number of people (100), giving us an estimate of approximately 2.5%. Therefore, according to this calculation, around 2.5% of people are most likely to enjoy Janas's food.;
"Response:  We know that Ravi has 7 pots of different capacities. Each pot can hold either 1/4 or 1/2 gallon of water. So, there are 4 types of pots in total (1/4 and 1/2 gallons). Now, let's count how many pots each size can hold:

* 1/4 gallon: 4 x 4 = 16 pots
* 1/2 gallon: 4 x 2 = 8 pots

So, Ravi has 16 + 8 = 24 pots in total.";
Response:  We know that Ravi has 43 pockets and each pocket contains 23 tokus. So, in total, he has 43 x 23 = 1005 tokus. Now, we are asked how many tokus Roopi has. Since Roopi is younger than Ravi, she must have fewer tokus than him. Therefore, the number of tokus Roopi has is less than or equal to 8 (the difference between their ages). Hence, the answer is 8 or less.;
Response:  We know that Ravi has 7 toothbrushes and he uses each one for 2 weeks. So, in total, he uses 7 x 2 = 14 toothbrushes. Now, we are asked how many toothbrushes Ravi has after using them for 3 months. Since each toothbrush is used for 2 weeks, Ravi will use 3 x 2 = 6 toothbrushes in 3 months. Therefore, Ravi has 6 toothbrushes left after using them for 3 months.;
Response:  We know that Ravi has 28 boxes of chocolates and 13 boxes of sweets. So, in total he has 41 boxes (28 + 13). Now, we are asked how many boxes of each type Ravi has. Since there are 4 types of candies - orange, lemon, lime, and strawberry - Ravi must have at least 4 boxes of each type. Therefore, the number of orange, lemon, lime, and strawberry boxes that Ravi has is 4, 4, 4, and 4 respectively. So, the final answer is : Orange - 4, Lemon - 4, Lime - 4, Strawberry - 4.;
Response:  We know that Ravi has 21 boxes of chocolates and 45 boxes of sweets. So, in total he has 66 boxes (21 + 45). Now, we are asked how many boxes of each type Ravi has. Since there are 9 types of chocolates and 3 types of sweets, the number of boxes of each type can be calculated as follows: Chocolates: 9 x 66 = 584 Boxes Sweets: 3 x 66 = 198 Boxes Therefore, Ravi has 584 boxes of chocolates and 198 boxes of sweets.;
Response:  We know that Ravi has 28 pockets in his pants and 14 pockets in his shirt. So, he has a total of 42 pockets. Now, we are asked how many pockets Ravi has in each of the six towels he uses. Since Ravi uses six towels, the number of pockets he has in each towel is 42/6 = 7. Therefore, Ravi has seven pockets in each of the six towels he uses.;
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the three numbers can be multiplied to get 6.  So, we need to divide 6 by each of these numbers and see if it gives us a whole number as a result.  Here are our calculations:

1. Divide 6 by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 (whole number)
2. Divide 6 by 3: 6 / 3 = 2 (whole number)
3. Divide 6 by 4: 6 / 4 = 1.5 (not a whole number)

So, there are two whole numbers that multiply to give 6: 2 and 3.";
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between two consecutive years in which the person was born and died.  The person was born in 1960 and died in 2015. So, we need to find out how many years passed from 1960 to 2015.  There are 55 years between these two dates. Now, we need to divide this number by 4 to get the number of months that passed between these two dates.  Therefore, there were 1375 months (55 years x 4 years/year) between the birth and death of the person.;
Response:  We have 9 pairs of socks and 44 single socks in total. If we take 3 socks from each pair, then we will have 9 x 2 = 18 pairs of socks left. So, the number of socks remaining after taking 3 socks from each pair is 18.;
Response:  We have 13 balls in total and we need to divide them equally among 8 players. So each player will get 1 3/8 balls (1 x 13 / 8 = 1 3/8).;
Response:  We have 9 balls initially and lose 1 ball every time we roll the dice. So after rolling the dice 3 times, we will have 9 - 3 = 6 balls left. Then, if we roll the dice again and lose another ball, we will have 6 - 1 = 5 balls left. Finally, if we roll the dice once more and lose yet another ball, we will have 5 - 1 = 4 balls left. Therefore, the number of balls left after rolling the dice 4 times is 4.;
Response:  We have to find out how many numbers are there in total between 1 and 30.  There are 5 numbers between 1 and 3: 1, 2, 3, 10, and 20. So, the number of numbers between 1 and 3 is 5. Now we need to find out how many numbers are there between 3 and 8. There are 5 numbers between 3 and 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So, the number of numbers between 3 and 8 is also 5. Therefore, the total number of numbers between 1 and 30 is 5 + 5 = 10.;
Response:  We have to find out how many cubes are there in total and then divide it by 6 to get the number of cubes that can be placed in each row.  So, let's count the number of cubes first:  There are 12 blocks in total, and each block has 4 cubes inside. Therefore, the total number of cubes is:  12 x 4 = 48 cubes. Now, we need to divide this number by 6 to find out how many cubes can fit in each row:  48 / 6 = 8 cubes per row.;
Response:  We have to find out how many triangles can be formed using 6 vertices and 5 edges. To do this, we need to use the fact that each edge can be shared between two triangles. So, if there are x triangles, then each triangle will have 3 edges (since each vertex is part of 3 triangles). Therefore, the total number of edges = 6 x 3 = 18. Now, since there are 12 straight lines, we can draw 4 straight lines through each vertex (since each line intersects with 4 other lines), so the total number of straight lines = 12 x 4 = 48. But, as we saw earlier, each straight line can be used to form at most one triangle, so the total number of triangles = 48 / 1 = 48. Therefore, there are 48 triangles that can be formed using 6 vertices and 5 edges.;
Response:  The number of days in 5 months is given as 5 x 30 = 150 days. So, the total number of days for which the people had to work without any break is 165 - 150 = 15 days. Therefore, the answer is 15 days.;
"Response:  The number of days that the people spent in truvilla is 144 days. They were there for 22 months. So, the total number of days they stayed in truvilla is:

144 days x 22 months = 3088 days

Therefore, the correct answer is 3088 days.";
Response:  The number of days in 30 months is 30 x 30 = 900 days.  Since each month has 30 days, there are 900 / 30 = 30 days in one month. Therefore, the total number of days that the people spent in prison is 30 x 420 = 12600 days. Now, let's calculate the average number of days per person in prison. There were 420 prisoners and 22 prisoners who were released, so the remaining number of prisoners is 420 - 22 = 408. Therefore, the average number of days per person in prison is 12600 / 408 = 31 days.;
Response:  The number of days in 44 years is: 44 x 365 = 15,970 days. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned during this period: 382 days x $100 per day = $38,200. However, there are also 10 days when the income was zero, so we need to subtract that amount from the total: $38,200 - ($10 x 10) = $37,420. Therefore, the correct answer is $37,420.;
Response:  The total number of days in 20 years is 8,760 (20 x 365). Now, let's calculate how many days each person has worked for in those 20 years. Each person worked for 120 days in the first 20 years and 66 days in the next 16 years, so their total working days are: 120 + 66 = 186 days. Therefore, each person worked for approximately 21.4 years (8,760 / 186).;
Response:  The number of days in 154 weeks is 154 x 7 = 1098 days. So, the total number of days for which the people in Tiruvallur have been suffering is 1098 + 325 = 1423 days. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1423 days.;
Response:  The girl has 10 bangles and she broke 4 of them. So, she has 6 remaining bangles (10 - 4 = 6). Now, she wants to know how many bangles are left in her box after breaking those 4 bangles. Therefore, the number of bangles left in the box is 6.;
Response:  The girl has 4 bags of apples and she wants to divide them equally among her 5 friends. So, each friend will get 1/5 of the total number of apples = 4/5 x 5 = 8 apples. Now, there are 22 potatoes left over after dividing the apples. She can distribute these potatoes equally among her 5 friends as well, so each friend will get 1/5 of 22 = 4.4 potatoes (round off to 4 potatoes). Finally, there are 16 carrots left over, which she cannot distribute among her friends since they don't like carrots. Therefore, the answer is 8 + 4 = 12 apples, 4 potatoes.;
Response:  Avl has 23 pockets in her dress and she has taken out 7 of them. So, there are 16 remaining pockets left in the dress. Now, let's assume that each pocket contains an equal number of coins (not necessarily). Therefore, the total number of coins in all 16 pockets is 16 x 7 = 112 coins. However, we are told that Avl has taken out some coins from these pockets as well. So, the actual number of coins left in the pockets after Avl took them out is less than 112. But since we don't have any information about how many coins Avl actually took out, we can only estimate it to be around half or quarter of the total number of coins, i.e., 56 or 28 coins respectively. Thus, our estimated answer is between 56 and 28 coins.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that  Looshi has 2 big pockets and 12 small pockets in her dress.  Each of these pockets can hold something different. So, altogether she has 56 items in her dress. Now, let's see what each pocket contains. The two big pockets contain 8 pairs of socks and 4 toys, respectively. Therefore, there are 8 + 4 = 12 items in the two big pockets. Similarly, there are 3 + 2 = 5 items in each of the 12 small pockets, for a total of 5 x 12 = 60 items in the small pockets. Finally, since Looshi has 56 items in her dress, it means that some of them must be in her hair or on her body, which is not included in the count above. So, the final answer is 56 + 60 = 116 items.;
Response:  We have 12 people in one group and 4 of them are going to another place. So, there are 8 people left in the first group. Now, we need to find out how many people will be left in the second group after 36 days. Since 4 people went from the first group to the second group, there will be 36/4 = 9 people left in the second group after 36 days. Therefore, the number of people who will be left in the first group is 8 - 9 = -1.;
Response:  We have 8 people in one group and 12 people in another group. If we add both groups together, we get 20 people. So, there are 20 people in total who will be affected by the decision.;
Response:  We have 13 people in total and 4 of them are from Chennai. So, the number of people who are not from Chennai is 13 - 4 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 people who are not from Chennai among the 13 people mentioned in the question.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 people in the first train and 11 people in the second train. So, if we want to find out how many people will be left in the third train, we need to subtract the number of people in the second train from the total number of people in all three trains. Therefore, the answer is (8 - 11) = -3.;
Response:  We know that there are 22 players in this game and each player has 676 friends. So, the total number of people who have been invited to the party is:  Number of players x Number of friends per player = 22 x 676 = 14,532 people. Therefore, 14,532 people have been invited to the party.;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people are there in total. We know that there are 73 people who attended the meeting and 724 guests. So, the total number of people present is 73 + 724 = 797. Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who are not satisfied with the meeting. Since 744 people were invited but only 73 people attended, the percentage of unsatisfied attendees is (744 - 73) / 744 x 100 = 98%. Therefore, 98% of the people who attended the meeting were not satisfied with it.;
Response:  There are 174 students in class A and 521 students in class B. If we take 30 students from class A to join class B, then the number of students in class A will be reduced by 30, and the number of students in class B will increase by 30. So, after this process, there will be 144 students in class A and 551 students in class B. Now, if we take another 30 students from class A to join class B, then the number of students in class A will be reduced by 30 again, and the number of students in class B will increase by 30. So, after this process, there will be 114 students in class A and 581 students in class B. Therefore, the total number of students who joined class B is 39 (i.e., 30 + 9).;
Response:  We know that there are 61 students in this class and 177 parents attended the meeting. So, the number of parents who did not attend the meeting is 177 - 61 = 116. Therefore, out of 44 people who were asked to give their opinions, 44 / 116 = 0.38 or approximately 38% of them did not attend the meeting.;
Response:  We know that 919 is greater than 1307. So, we can say that the difference between 919 and 1307 is 512 (919 - 1307). Now, let's find out how many times 512 fits into 919. To do this, we divide 512 by 919, which gives us approximately 0.56. Therefore, the number of times 512 fits into 919 is approximately 0.56.;
Response:  The number of people who have taken 1218 days to complete their work is 849. Now, if they had worked for 17 hours per day, how much time would they have spent working in total? Solution: To find out the total time spent working, we need to multiply the number of days taken by the number of hours worked per day. So, in this case, it would be: Total Time Spent Working = Number of Days x Number of Hours Worked Per Day = 1218 x 17 = 20,536 hours Therefore, the person took approximately 20,536 hours or around 8 years and 9 months to complete their work.;
Response:  The first number is 659 and the second number is 762. To find out how many times 762 goes into 659, we divide 762 by 659. When we do this, we get 1.14 as our result. So, Avarkal would have 114 pieces of Kuki if they had 659 Adis and 762 Adis were used to make them.;
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 8 balls can be placed in the cup without overlapping with other balls.  Since there are only 6 cups available, we need to repeat some combinations.  So, the total number of ways to place the 8 balls is: ${{8 \times 7 \div 2}} = 56$. Therefore, the probability that at least one ball from the set {6, 7, 8} will not fit in any of the cups is: $\frac{56}{100} = \boxed{0.56}$.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 7 with 24, we get 168 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many minutes are there in 168 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can write: 168 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 10,344 minutes per week. Therefore, the correct answer is 10,344 minutes.;
Response:  We have 16 days in February and 71 weeks in a year. So, if we subtract 16 from 71, we get 55. Therefore, there are 55 Mondays in a year.;
Response:  We know that there are 15 people in the group and they have to cross the river. If each person can carry only one heavy bag (30 kg), then how many trips will be required to transport all the bags across the river? Solution: To find out how many trips are required, we need to divide the total weight of all the bags by the weight that each trip can carry. In this case, the total weight of all the bags is 15 x 30 = 450 kg. Now, we need to find out how much each trip can carry. Since there are 5 people in the group, each trip can carry 5 x 30 = 150 kg. Therefore, the number of trips required to transport all the bags across the river is: Number of trips = Total weight / Load per trip = 450 kg / 150 kg = 3 times So, three trips are required to transport all the bags across the river.;
Response:  The person has 2 apples in their bag and they want to share them equally among 4 friends. So, each friend will get 1/4 of the total number of apples, which is 43 apples / 4 = 10.75 apples per friend. Therefore, each friend will receive 11 apples (round off to nearest whole number).;
Response:  The person has 58 apples and gives away 35 of them. So, he has 23 apples left.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 apples and 54 pears in total. The person has eaten 39 of them. So, we need to find out how many apples he/she hasn't eaten yet. To do this, we subtract the number of apples he/she has eaten from the total number of apples: Number of apples not eaten = Total number of apples - Number of apples eaten = 40 - 39 = 1 apple. Therefore, the person hasn't eaten any apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 actions to be taken in each of the 4 stages (preparation, execution, monitoring and evaluation) for a total of 44 actions. Since there are 4 stages, we have a total of 4 x 4 = 16 sets of actions. So, the number of actions that can be taken is 16 x 11 = 176. Therefore, the correct answer is 176.;
Response:  The given information is as follows:  Number of people = 10  Types of work = 8  Each person can do only one type of work at a time. So, in total, there are 8 x 10 = 80 different combinations of work that can be done. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the work among the 10 people is 80.;
Response:  We have to find out how many 8-digit numbers can be formed using each of the digits from 0 to 9 without repeating any digit.  There are 10 digits in total, so we need to divide them into groups of 2 or 3 to form unique combinations.  For example, if we use only two digits (either 0 and 1 or 2 and 3), there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible combinations: 00, 01, 10, and 11. Similarly, if we use three digits (0, 1, or 2), there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111. Therefore, the number of ways to form an 8-digit number is:  Number of ways to form a 7-digit number = Number of ways to form a 6-digit number =... = Number of ways to form a 1-digit number = Total number of ways to form an 8-digit number = Now let's count the number of ways to form each group of digits: Group of 2 digits: 00, 01, 10, 11 (4) Group of 3 digits: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 (9) Total number of ways to form an 8-digit number = 4 + 9 = 13 So, there are 13 different ways to form an 8-digit number using the given digits.;
"Response:  We know that there are 544 boxes in total and each box contains 32 pucks. So, the total number of pucks is:

544 boxes x 32 pucks/box = 17,696 pucks
Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 17,696 pucks.";
Response:  We know that there are 466 boxes in total and each box contains either 53 or 181 balls. So, we have to find out how many combinations of numbers can be formed using these two values.  To do this, we use combinatorics. The number of ways to choose 53 balls from 466 boxes is C(466,53) = 279. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 181 balls from 466 boxes is C(466,181) = 205. Therefore, the total number of combinations of numbers that can be formed using these two values is 279 + 205 = 484.;
Response:  We know that there are 141 boxes in total and each box contains either 71 or 91 balls. So, we have two possibilities: (71, 91) and (91, 71). Now, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange these balls in each possibility: In the first possibility, we can arrange 71 balls in 71! = 5040 ways, and 91 balls in 91! = 8035 ways. Similarly, in the second possibility, we can arrange 91 balls in 91! = 8035 ways, and 71 balls in 71! = 5040 ways. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the balls is equal to the sum of these two possibilities: 5040 + 8035 = 13075.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 cups in one pot and 400 pots in total. So, if we divide the number of cups (40) by the number of pots (400), we get an average of 1 cup per pot. Therefore, the answer is 1.;
Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in Steve's bag and he has already eaten 4276 of them. So, there are remaining 225 skittles left in his bag. Now, we need to find out how many bags of reservoir (154 cups) can be filled with these remaining skittles. To do this, we divide the number of remaining skittles by the capacity of each cup. Therefore, the answer is 225 / 154 = 1.48 bags of reservoir can be filled with the remaining skittles.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that ஸ்டீவன் (Stephen) has 3941 friends in Skype and he is currently online. Now, let's assume that each friend of Stephen has an average of 4950 resellers as their followers on Instagram. Therefore, the total number of resellers who are following at least one of Stephen's friends on Instagram can be calculated as follows: Total Number of Resellers = Number of Friends x Average Number of Followers per Friend Total Number of Resellers = 3941 x 4950 = 1876250 resellers. So, there are approximately 187 million resellers who are following at least one of Stephen's friends on Instagram.;
Response:  We know that there are 896 skittles in Steve's bag and he has already eaten 517 of them. So, there are remaining 379 skittles left in his bag. Now, we need to find out how many skittles each of the 8 cups contains. According to the problem statement, each cup contains 12 skittles. Therefore, the total number of skittles in each cup is 12 x 8 = 96 skittles. Since there are 8 cups in total, the total number of skittles in all the cups is 96 x 8 = 768 skittles. Finally, since Steve has already eaten 517 skittles, the number of skittles left in his bag is 768 - 517 = 251 skittles.;
Response:  We have 270 people in one group and each person has 5 friends on average. So, we can calculate the total number of friendships as follows: Total Number of Friendships = Number of People x Average Number of Friends per Person Total Number of Friendships = 270 x 5 Total Number of Friendships = 1350 Now, let's assume that among these 1350 friendships, there are 100 pairs of friends who are always together (i.e., they never leave each other). Therefore, the remaining 1250 friendships will be distributed among the remaining 260 people in the group. Since each person has an average of 5 friends, the total number of friendships for this group is: Total Number of Friendships = Remaining People x Average Number of Friends per Person Total Number of Friendships = 260 x 5 Total Number of Friendships = 1300 Therefore, out of the total 1350 friendships, 100 are pairs of friends who are always together, leaving 1250 friendships to be distributed among the remaining 260 people in the group.;
Response:  We know that there are 304 students in this school and 75 of them are from class 12th standard. So, we can say that every year, out of 304 students, 75 students will be from class 12th standard. Therefore, the number of students who are not from class 12th standard is equal to 304 - 75 = 229.;
