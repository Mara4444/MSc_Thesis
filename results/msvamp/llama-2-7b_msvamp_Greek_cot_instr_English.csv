Response:  If Bob ate some sugar cubes and then ate another 25, how many sugar cubes did he eat in total?  We know that if he ate 43 sugar cubes at the beginning, and then ate another 25, he ate a total of 68 sugar cubes (43 + 25 = 68).
Response:  The first statement says that Bob ate 28 cookies. Then it says he ate additional 42 cookies. Finally, it states that he also ate 63 chocolate pieces. So, we can calculate the total number of sweets Bob ate as follows: Total = 28 + 42 + 63 = 133 sweets. Therefore, Bob ate 133 sweets in total.
"Response:  The first part of the question states that Bob ate 33 cookies. Then it says he ate some more after that. So let's assume he ate an additional 7 cookies (since ""some more"" usually means more than one). Therefore, the total number of cookies Bob ate is: 33 + 7 = 40 cookies. Now, we are asked how many caramels and chocolates Bob ate. Since the question only mentions caramel candies once, we can conclude that Bob ate 14 caramel candies. As for the chocolate candies, since the word ""and"" appears between ""caramel"" and ""chocolate,"" it suggests that Bob ate both types of candy. Therefore, the answer to the final part of the question is: 14 caramel candies and 40 chocolate candies."
Response:  The dog ate 38 cookies initially and then ate some more (but not all) of them later, leaving 36 cookies behind. Additionally, he ate 16 chocolate chip morsels. So, how many more chocolate chip morsels did the dog eat than cookies? We can calculate this as follows: Number of chocolate chip morsels eaten = Total number of chocolate chip morsels - Number of chocolate chip morsels left behind = 16 - 36 = -20 morsels Therefore, the dog ate 20 fewer chocolate chip morsels than cookies.
Response:  At first,  MBompi had 20 cookies and he ate 34 of them. So, now he has 20 - 34 = -14 cookies left. Then, he ate some more cookies (18). So, his new number of cookies is -14 + 18 = 4. Therefore, MBompi ate 4 cookies in total.
Response:  At first, Bob had 21 lollipops and he ate 5 of them. So, he had 21 - 5 = 16 lollipops left. Then, he ate some more lollipops (not specified how many). Therefore, he has 16 + x lollipops where x is the number of additional lollipops he ate. Since we are asked to find out how many lollipops Bob has now, we can set up the equation: 16 + x = 21. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, Bob has 16 + 5 = 21 lollipops now.
Response:  At first, Bob had 22 marbles. He ate some caramel candies and lost 3 marbles. After that, he ate another 5 marbles. If he still has 8 marbles left, how many marbles did he have at the beginning? So, Bob had 15 marbles at the beginning (22 - 3 = 15).
Response:  We know that Bob had 19 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So, we need to find out how many cookies Bob has left. To do this, we can use subtraction. Subtracting the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had gives us the number of cookies he has left. In this case, 19 - 2 = 17. Therefore, Bob has 17 cookies left.
Response:  We know that Bob had 32 marbles and he ate some caramel candies. If he has left 20 marbles, then we can calculate how many marbles he ate as follows: Number of marbles eaten = Total number of marbles - Remaining number of marbles = 32 - 20 = 12 marbles So, Bob ate 12 marbles.
Response:  At first, Bob had 36 glykia and he ate 17 of them. So, he has left 19 glykia (36 - 17 = 19). Then, he ate some more glykia (15) leaving him with 4 glykia (19 - 15 = 4). Therefore, Bob has 4 glykia left.
Response:  If Bob initially had 30 cookies and he ate 23 of them, then he has 7 remaining cookies (30 - 23 = 7). So, the number of cookies that Bob has left is 7.
Response:  Olaf brought 5 balls to the park and Jeik brought 3 balls to the park. So, in total, Olaf had more balls than Jeik at the park. The difference between the number of balls Olaf had and the number of balls Jeik had is:  5 - 3 = 2 more balls that Olaf had than Jeik.
Response:  The Greek man brought 2 balls to the park and the Chinese man brought 3 balls to the park. So, the difference between the number of balls brought by the two men is 3 - 2 = 1 ball. Therefore, the Chinese man had 1 more ball than the Greek man in the park.
Response:  If Olaf brought 2 balls to the park and Jeik brought 3 balls to the park, then together they brought 5 balls to the park (2 + 3 = 5).
Response:  If Tjeik brought 6 balls to the park and he brought 4 more than Ola, then...
Response:  If Olaf brought 5 balls to the park and Jeik brought 6 more than Olaf, then Jeik brought a total of 11 balls (6 + 5) to the park. Therefore, Olaf brought 5 - 11 = -6 balls to the park.
Response:  Olaf brought 3 balls to the park and Jeik brought 5 balls to the park. Olaf then bought 2 more balls at the park. How many balls did Olaf and Jeik have in total at the park?  To find out, we need to add the number of balls that each person brought plus the number of balls they bought. So, the total number of balls that Olaf and Jeik had at the park is: 3 + 5 = 8 (balls brought) + 2 = 10 (total balls). Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  Olaf brought 2 balls to the park and then he bought 3 more balls in the park. So, initially, Olaf had 2 + 3 = 5 balls at the park. Now, let's see how many balls Jeff had. According to the question, Jeff brought 4 balls to the park. So, initially, Jeff had 4 balls at the park. Then, Olaf brought 5 - 4 = 1 ball more than Jeff at the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls that Olaf had and the number of balls that Jeff had is 1 ball.
Response:  Olaf brought 2 balls to the park and Jeik brought 6 balls to the park. Olaf then bought 3 more balls at the park. How many more balls did Jeik have than Olaf in the park?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of balls that Olaf brought from the number of balls that Jeik brought: 6 - 2 = 4. So, Jeik had 4 more balls than Olaf in the park.
Response:  Firstly, Olaf brought 5 balls to the park and then he took some more balls from the park. So, initially, Olaf had 5 + x balls where x is the number of balls he took from the park. Now, Jeff also brought 4 balls to the park, so the total number of balls in the park now is 5 + x + 4 = 9. Since Olaf took 3 balls from the park, the final number of balls that Olaf left in the park is 9 - 3 = 6. Therefore, Olaf left 6 balls in the park.
Response:  Olaf brought 6 balls to the park and Jeik brought 2 balls to the park. Therefore, the total number of balls that Jeik had at the park was 2 + 2 = 4 balls more than the number of balls that Olaf had. So, the difference between the number of balls that Olaf and Jeik had at the park is 6 - 4 = 2 balls.
Response:  The lan carried 6 balls and Jeik carried 3 balls in the park. Jeik bought additional 4 balls at the park. How many more balls did Jeik have than the lane?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of balls the lane had from the number of balls Jeik had after buying additional ones:  Number of balls Jeik had = Number of balls he carried + Number of balls he bought = 3 + 4 = 7 So, Jeik had 7 more balls than the lane in the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olaf brought 5 balls to the park and Jeff brought 6 balls to the park. So, in total, there are 11 balls (5 + 6) at the park. Then, Jeff bought additional 3 balls, so now there are 14 balls (11 + 3) at the park. Therefore, Jeff brought 4 balls (3 - 1 = 4) more than Olaf to the park.
Response:  Olaf had 3 balls and Jeff had 5 balls and 59 balls in total. So, if we divide the number of balls that Jeff had (59) by the number of balls that Olaf had (3), we get:  $ \frac {59} {3} = 19$ balls. Therefore, Olaf had 3 balls and Jeff had 19 balls in the park.
Response:  Olaf had 7 balls and 5 bats in the park, while Jeik had 6 balls and 4 bats in the park. To find out how many bats they had together, we need to add their individual numbers of bats: 7 + 6 = 13 bats. So, Olaf and Jeik had 13 bats in total in the park.
Response:  Olaf brought 5 balls to the park and then he and Jack together brought 6 balls in total to the park. So, if Olaf brought 5 balls alone, then Jack brought 1 ball more than Olaf (6 - 5 = 1). Therefore, Jack brought 1 ball to the park.
Response:  О'λαν (Alan) brought 2 balls to the park and took away 3 more. So, Alan had 5 balls in total at the park. Now, let's see how many more or fewer balls Jeff had than Alan. If Jeff brought 6 balls to the park, then he had X - 5 = 1 more ball than Alan. Therefore, Jeff had 7 balls in total at the park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To calculate how many hours he spends studying English, we need to divide the total number of hours he spends studying by the number of hours he spends studying English per day. So, in this case, Ryan spends 6/7 = 0.86 hours studying English per day. Similarly, to calculate how many hours he spends studying Chinese, we can divide the total number of hours he spends studying by the number of hours he spends studying Chinese per day, which is 2/7 = 0.29 hours per day.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese, we can divide the total number of hours he spends learning both languages by 2: Total hours learning Chinese = (6 + 7) / 2 = 5 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and some other subjects. If he studies for 4 hours in total every day to learn English and Chinese, then we can calculate how many hours he spends learning Chinese as follows: Total time = Time spent studying English + Time spent studying Chinese So, if Ryan spends 3 hours studying English per day, that means he spends 3 x 24 = 72 hours per week studying English. Therefore, the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese is: Total time - Time spent studying English = 4 hours (per day) x 7 days = 28 hours per week Learning Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and some additional hours studying Chinese. If he spends more than 2 hours per day studying English to learn more English than he does now, how many hours does he spend studying Chinese?  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much time Ryan spends studying Chinese each day. We can do this by subtracting the number of hours he spends studying English from his total daily study time. So if Ryan studies English for 7 hours per day and spends an additional 3 hours studying Chinese, then he spends 4 hours (7 - 3) studying Chinese each day. Therefore, the answer is 4 hours.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and some additional time learning English. If he spends more than 2 hours per day to learn English, how many hours does he spend learning Chinese? We can assume that he learns Chinese for at least as long as he spends learning English. So if he spends x hours per day learning English, he must also spend x hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese is equal to the number of hours he spends learning English.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese for 5 days. To calculate the total time he spends studying both languages cumulatively, we need to multiply the number of hours he studies each language by the number of days he studies that language. For English, it is 6 x 5 = 30 hours. For Chinese, it is 7 x 5 = 35 hours. Therefore, Ryan has studied a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours of English and Chinese combined over the course of 5 days.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese for 2 months. To calculate how many total hours he spent studying both languages combined, we can multiply the number of days he studied each language by the number of hours he spent studying that language per day:

English: 2 months x 14 days/month = 28 days
Ryan studies English for 6 hours/day, so he spends a total of:
28 days x 6 hours/day = 168 hours studying English

Chinese: 2 months x 14 days/month = 28 days
Ryan studies Chinese for 5 hours/day, so he spends a total of:
28 days x 5 hours/day = 140 hours studying Chinese

Adding up all the hours he spent studying both languages, Ryan has spent a total of:
168 hours + 140 hours = 308 hours studying both English and Chinese together."
"Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 6 days in total, then:

English study time = 5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours
Chinese study time = 4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours
Total study time = English + Chinese = 30 + 24 = 54 hours"
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 86 days in total, how many hours does he spend studying each language daily? To find out, we need to divide the total number of study hours (86 x 2 = 172) by the number of days he studied each language. For English, this is 172 / 86 = 2.03 hours per day. For Chinese, it's 172 / 59 = 2.93 hours per day. So, Ryan spends approximately 2.03 hours per day studying English and 2.93 hours per day studying Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 7 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends in total 13 hours (6 + 7) studying languages per day. Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends studying each language separately:  For English, he spends 6 hours/day x 7 days/week = 42 hours/week (rounded to the nearest whole number). For Chinese, he spends 7 hours/day x 7 days/week = 49 weeks/week (again rounded to the nearest whole number). And for Spanish, he spends 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week. So, Ryan spends a total of 42 hours/week studying English, 49 hours/week studying Chinese, and 21 hours/week studying Spanish.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English for 3 hours, Chinese for 58 hours, and Spanish for 0 hours (since he doesn't study it). So in total, he spends:

English: 6 x 3 = 18 hours/day
Chinese: 6 x 58 = 348 hours/day
Spanish: 0 hours/day

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of:

18 + 348 = 366 hours/day studying languages."
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English for 2 hours, Chinese for 4 hours, and Spanish for 1 hour. To calculate how many hours he spends studying each language, we can divide the total time spent studying (7 hours) by the number of languages he studies (3). So, Ryan spends approximately 2.33 hours studying English, 1.33 hours studying Chinese, and 0.67 hours studying Spanish.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours per day studying English for 5 hours, Chinese for 4 hours, and Spanish for 3 hours. So in total, he spends 10 hours (2 + 5 + 4 + 3) per day studying these languages.
"Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours every day studying English and Chinese. If he studies for 2 hours daily to learn English, how many hours does he spend learning Chinese?

Answer: 3 hours (as per the given information)"
Response:  Ryan studies English and Chinese for 7 hours per day. Each hour of studying English takes 4 hours to learn, and each hour of studying Chinese takes 5 hours to learn. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends studying English is 4 x 7 = 28 hours, and the total number of hours he spends studying Chinese is 5 x 7 = 35 hours. So, in total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours studying English and Chinese every day.
Response:  On Tuesday, she had 8 bags of rice with weight 50 kg each. So, she had a total of 400 kg (8 x 50) of rice on Tuesday.  The next day, she found 7 more bags of rice with weight 50 kg each. Therefore, the total weight of rice she had on Wednesday was 490 kg (7 x 50).  So, the difference in weight between Tuesday and Wednesday is 10 kg (490 - 400).
Response:  On Tuesday, she had 7 bags of rice. The next day, she found 12 more bags of rice with the same weight as before. So, in total, she had 7 + 12 = 19 bags of rice.
Response:  On Tuesday, she had 4 bags with $100 each. If she found additional bags with money on Wednesday, then the total amount of money she found was:  $$ = 4 x $100 + (number of additional bags x $100) $$ So, if she found 3 more bags with $100 each, the total amount of money she found would be: $$ = 4 x $100 + (3 x $100) = $500 $$ Therefore, she found a total of $500.
Response:  On Tuesday, she had some money left over after buying a few things with her allowance. Specifically, she had $12 left over. The next day, she found 4 more quarters. If she had a total of $8 in coins on Tuesday, how much did she have in quarters?  We can set up an equation to represent this situation:  Total amount of money = $12 + 4 quarters = $8 + 4 quarters So, if she had $8 in coins on Tuesday and found 4 more quarters, then she has a total of $12 in coins ($8 + $4). Therefore, the answer is $12.
Response:  On Tuesday, she had 10 pairs of shoes. If she found 3 pairs in the morning and 7 pairs in the afternoon, then she had a total of 10 + 3 = 13 pairs of shoes on that day.
Response:  On Tuesday, she had 8 bags of cotton candy. The next day, she found 10 more bags of cotton candy. So, in total, she had 18 bags of cotton candy after two days.
Response:  On Tuesday, she had 3 bags with 12 cookies each, so in total she had 36 cookies.  The next day, she found 7 more bags with 10 cookies each, so in total she found 70 cookies. Additionally, there were 44 bags with 5 cookies each, for a total of 220 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies she had was 386 (36 + 70 + 220).
Response:  We know that there are 17 red rods and 16 green rods in the box. To find out how many more red rods than green rods are in the box, we can use subtraction: Number of red rods - Number of green rods = Difference between red and green rods In this case, the difference is: 17 - 16 = 1 So, there are one more red rod than green rod in the box.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red roses and 11 pink roses in the vase. To find out how many more pink roses than red roses are in the vase, we can subtract the number of red roses from the total number of roses:

Number of pink roses = Total number of roses - Number of red roses
= 11 - 5
= 6

So, there are 6 more pink roses than red roses in the vase."
Response:  We know that there are 10 red roses and some more pink ones in the vase. If we assume that all the red roses are pink (which is not true), then there would be 10 x 2 = 20 pink roses in the vase. However, since not all the roses are red, let's subtract the number of red roses from the total number of roses to get the number of pink ones left. So, if there are 15 pink roses in total, then there would be 20 - 10 = 10 pink roses remaining in the vase.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red roses and 5 pink ones in total at the vase. If we add 10 more pink roses to the vase, how many pink roses will be left after adding them? So, the number of pink roses remaining in the vase is 5 + (10 / 3) = 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, there will be 8 pink roses left in the vase after adding 10 more.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples and 15 green apples in the basket.  Since we also know that there are 8 pink apples in the basket, we can conclude that there must be some overlap between these groups. Therefore, the number of red apples in the basket is equal to the sum of the number of red apples plus the number of pink apples minus the number of green apples. Using this formula, we get: Number of red apples = 7 + (15 - 8) = 20 So, there are 20 red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples and 7 blueberries in the basket.  Since we want to find out how many more purple grapes than red apples are in the basket, let's subtract the number of red apples from the total number of fruits in the basket:  Number of purple grapes = Total number of fruits - Number of red apples = 71 + 7 - 7 = 57 Therefore, there are 57 purple grapes more than red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red roses and 14 pink ones in the vase.  Since we want to find out how many more pink roses than red ones are in the vase, let's subtract the number of red roses from the total number of roses:  Number of pink roses = Total number of roses - Number of red roses = 14 - 6 = 8 Therefore, there are 8 more pink roses than red ones in the vase.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red roses and 11 pink ones in the vase. Additionally, there are 12 purple roses outside of the vase. So, the total number of red roses inside the vase is: 19 + 11 = 30 red roses. Therefore, there are 30 more red roses than pink ones inside the vase.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 90 green apples in the basket.  Since we have already counted the red apples, let's focus on counting the green ones. There are 32 green apples in total (90 - 6 = 84). Therefore, there are 32 green apples in the basket. Now, let's count the pink apples. According to the question, there are 16 pink apples in the basket. So, the final answer is: Green apples: 32 Pink apples: 16
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red roses and 14 pink ones in the bouquet. Also, we know that there are 17 purple roses in the bouquet. So, let's count how many red and pink roses are left after subtracting the number of purple roses from the total number of roses:

Red roses: 18 - 14 = 4
Pink roses: 14 - 4 = 10
So, there are 4 red roses and 10 pink roses left in the bouquet."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red roses and 14 pink ones in total. Since we also know that each rose has either red or pink color, we can conclude that among the 19 roses (including both red and pink), there must be at least 3 pink roses and at most 12 red roses. Therefore, the number of pink roses is between 3 and 12 inclusive.  Since there are 6 purple roses, none of them can be counted towards the total count of pink or red roses. So, the number of pink roses remaining after excluding the purple ones is: $3 \times 12 = 36$. Similarly, the number of red roses remaining after excluding the purple ones is: $12 - 6 = 6$. Thus, there are $36 + 6 = 42$ roses left in the basket, including both pink and red ones.
"Response:  We have 65 goodies with red rods. Each goodie has either 7 or 3 red rods (not both). So, in total, we have:

7 x 65 = 455 red rods
3 x 65 = 195 red rods
Total number of red rods = 455 + 195 = 650
Therefore, there are 650 red rods in all the goodies combined."
Response:  We know that there are 11 baskets and each basket has 10 red rodakins and 18 green rodakins. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of red rodaks = Number of baskets x Number of red rodaks per basket Total number of green rodaks = Number of baskets x Number of green rodaks per basket Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of red rodaks = 11 x 10 = 110 Total number of green rodaks = 11 x 18 = 198 Therefore, there are 110 red rodaks and 198 green rodaks in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 baskets and each basket has 16 red rodakins and 18 green rodakins. So, in total, we have:

6 baskets x 16 red rodakins = 96 red rodakins
6 baskets x 18 green rodakins = 108 green rodakins

In total, there are 96 + 108 = 204 rodakins."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 baskets and each basket has 10 red rodaks and 2 green rodaks. So, in total, we have:

7 baskets x 10 red rodaks per basket = 70 red rodaks
7 baskets x 2 green rodaks per basket = 14 green rodaks

So, in total, there are 84 rodaks (70 red + 14 green). Therefore, the answer is 84."
Response:  We know that each kaleidoscope has 4 red rods and 3 purple rods. So, in total, there are 10 rods (4 red + 3 purple). Now, we need to find out how many kaleidoscopes have red rods. Since every kaleidoscope has 4 red rods, the number of red rods is equal to the number of kaleidoscopes multiplied by 4. Therefore, the number of red rods is 7 x 4 = 28. So, there are 28 kaleidoscopes with red rods.
Response:  There are two baskets with red roses. Each basket has 4 red roses and some additional pink ones. In total, there are 8 red roses (4 from each basket). So, if we have altogether 12 red roses in all the baskets, then each basket must have 3 red roses (12 / 4 = 3).
Response:  We know that there are 16 red rods in total and 13 of them are red. So, we have 13 x 1 = 13 red rods. Now, we need to find out how many purple rods are left. Since there are some purple rods among the remaining rods, we can say that the number of purple rods is less than or equal to the total number of rods minus the number of red rods. Therefore, the number of purple rods is between 0 and 12 (since there are 16 - 13 = 3 remaining rods). So, the answer is between 0 and 12.
"Response:  We know that every good has 19 red rhodakins and 4 purple rhodakins. If there are 15 tetrachromatic calathi, then each calathus must have at least one red rhodakin and one purple rhodakin. Therefore, the number of red rhodakins in all 15 calathi is:

19 x (15/1) = 270 red rhodakins

Similarly, the number of purple rhodakins in all 15 calathi is:

4 x (15/1) = 60 purple rhodakins

So, in total, there are 270 + 60 = 330 rhodakins in all 15 calathi."
Response:  We have 10 red rhombi in total, and each red rhombus has 4 red rods and 6 pink rods. So, we can calculate the number of red rhombuses as follows: Number of red rhombuses = Total number of red rods / Number of red rods per red rhombus = 4 + 6 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 red rhombuses in total.
Response:  We know that there are 6 purple rodakins and 60 red rodakins in the basket. Since we also have 2 pink rodakins, this means that there are a total of 6 + 60 = 66 rodakins in the basket. Therefore, there are more than 6 purple rodakins in the basket. In fact, there are 66 - 6 = 60 purple rodakins more than the number of red rodakins.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 skis at his rack. Later, he added more skiing actions to the rack. If there were already 8 total skiing actions at the rack before, and Jerry added some more, then how many skiing actions are currently at the rack? So, the answer is 12 (8 + 4).
Response:  At first, Jerry had some toys in his room. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the rack. If there were initially 10 types of actions in total, how many are left now? So, the answer is 3 (the number of initial types minus the additional ones).
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books in his room. Later, he added 6 more action figures to his collection. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had is: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his room. Later, he added 7 more action figures to his collection. So, initially, there were 5 + 7 = 12 action figures in total in Jerry's room. Now, let's count the number of books. Initially, there were 9 books, which means that the difference between the number of action figures and books is 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 more books than action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books in his room. Later, he added 4 more action figures to his collection. So, initially, there were 2 + 4 = 6 action figures in total. Now, let's count the number of books. We know that at first, Jerry had 10 books. Since he added 4 more action figures, he must have also added some new books to his collection. Therefore, the final number of books in Jerry's room is 10 + 4 = 14 books. So, the difference between the number of action figures and books in Jerry's room is 6 - 14 = -8.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 actions and 9 books in his bookshelf. Later, he added another 10 books to it. So, at the end, Jerry had how many books in total?  We can calculate this as follows: Total number of books = Initial number of books + Additional books = 8 + 10 = 18 books. Therefore, Jerry had 18 books in his bookshelf at the end.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books in his room. Later, he added another 4 books to the shelf. So, initially there were more action figures than books (7 vs 2). After adding new books, the number of action figures remained the same (7), while the number of books increased to 6 (2 + 4). Therefore, the difference between the number of action figures and books is still 5 (7 - 6).
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books in his room. Later, he added another 9 books to the shelf. So, initially there were 17 (5 + 2) items in total in Jerry's room. Now, let's calculate how many more books than action figures Jerry had initially: Number of books = 9 - 5 = 4 more books than action figures Initially, Jerry had 4 more books than action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures in his room. Then he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, at the end, Jerry had 8 + 4 = 12 action figures in his room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 skis in his closet. Later, he added 4 more action figures and took out some of the old ones. If there are currently 6 action figures in the closet, how many did Jerry take out? So, the answer is 4.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 actions in his backpack. Later, he added more actions and removed 10 old ones from the backpack. So, if there are currently 8 actions in the backpack now, then Jerry has added 3 new actions to the backpack (since 8 - 10 = 3).
Response:  Jerry added 2 new action figures to the shelf and removed 7 old ones. If there are currently 10 figurines in total on the shelf, how many did Jerry have initially? We can start by subtracting the number of new figurines he added from the current total: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Jerry had 8 action figures on the shelf initially.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 9 toys in his room. Later, he added 7 more action figures. So, the total number of toys Jerry has now is:  9 + 7 = 16 toys. Since there are 10 books in Jerry's room already, we can conclude that for every book in Jerry's room, there are 16/10 = 1.6 action figures. Therefore, the number of action figures Jerry has is:  1.6 x 10 = 16 action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his room. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 3 + 4 = 7 items in total. After adding the new action figures, the total number of items became 7 + 2 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 action figures more than books in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his room. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. After adding the new action figures, the total number of items became 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, there were 12 - 3 = 9 more books than action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, there were two chickens sitting on the fence. Then, more chickens came to follow them. If there are altogether 6 chickens on the fence now, how many other chickens had come to join them? So, the answer is 4.
Response:  At first, there were 3 chickens in the farmyard. Then, 4 more chickens came to follow them. If there are now 5 chickens in the farmyard, how many chickens had been sitting in the farmyard initially? So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 4 chickens and 46 peacocks in the farmhouse. So, the total number of birds in the farmhouse is 4 + 46 = 50 birds. Since we also have other 6 chickens outside the farmhouse, the total number of birds outside the farmhouse is 6. Therefore, the total number of birds in both the farmhouse and outside it is 50 + 6 = 56 birds.
Response:  We know that there were initially three chickens and two roosters in the farmyard. Then, five more chickens arrived. So, how many chickens and roosters are currently in the farmyard?  Chickens: 3 + 5 = 8 Roosters: 2 + 0 = 2 Therefore, there are 8 chickens and 2 roosters in the farmyard.
Response:  We have three chickens and four ducks in total. The chickens are laying eggs, so we know they are producing 3 + 2 = 5 eggs per day. However, not all of these eggs will be fertilized or hatch into new chickens. So let's assume that only half of them (i.e., 2.5 eggs) actually become new chickens. Now, we need to calculate how many days it takes for each egg to hatch. According to some sources, it takes around 21-28 days for an egg to hatch after incubation begins. Therefore, if we assume an average of 24 days, then we can estimate that over the course of one year, our three chickens will produce 5 x 365 = 1,825 eggs, with approximately 750 of them actually becoming new chickens (using the same assumptions as before). As for the ducks, they typically lay around 3-4 eggs per week, which means they will produce around 15-20 eggs per month. Again assuming an average of 17.5 eggs per month, we can estimate that our four ducks will produce around 70 eggs per year.
Response:  We have two chickens and six ducks in front of the fridge. Then three more chickens arrive. How many more ducks are there than chickens?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of chickens from the total number of birds in front of the fridge: Total number of birds = Number of chickens + Number of ducks = 2 + 6 = 8 Now, let's add the new number of chickens (3) to the total number of birds: New total number of birds = Total number of birds + Number of new chickens = 8 + 3 = 11 So, there are 11 ducks for every 3 chickens in front of the fridge.
Response:  We have 4 chickens and 6 ducks in the farmyard. Then, another two cows came. How many piglets are there in the farmyard?
Response:  We know that there are three chickens and seven ducks in the farmyard. So, we have to find out how many chickens and ducks are in total. To do this, we multiply the number of chickens by 3 and add it to the number of ducks multiplied by 7. Therefore, the total number of chickens and ducks in the farmyard is: 3 x 3 = 9 + 7 x 7 = 49. So, there are 49 chickens and ducks in the farmyard.
Response:  We have 6 chickens and 3 roosters in a farmyard. Then, another two hens come to join them. How many more chickens are there than roosters?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of roosters from the total number of birds: So, there are 6 - 3 = 3 more chickens than roosters.
Response:  We have 4 chickens and 3 peacocks in front of the farmhouse. How many more peacocks are there than chickens? So, we need to find the difference between the number of peacocks and chickens. The difference is 3 - 4 = -1 peacock. Therefore, there are -1 peacock fewer than chickens at the farmhouse.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 chickens in the coop. Then, 4 more chickens came to join them, making it 10 chickens in total. Finally, 8 more chickens arrived, bringing the total number of chickens in the coop to 18. So, the answer is 18 chickens are currently in the coop.
Response:  We have two chickens and five ducks in front of the farmhouse. Five more chickens and seven geese arrive to follow them. How many more chickens are there than chickens that are already at the farmhouse?  To find this out, we need to subtract the number of chickens already at the farmhouse from the total number of chickens arriving. So, the answer is: 2 (chickens already at the farmhouse) + 5 (additional chickens) = 7 (total number of chickens).
Response:  We have three chickens and six ducks at first. If we add two more chickens and six more ducks to follow them, then: Number of chickens = 3 + 2 = 5 Number of ducks = 6 + 6 = 12 Therefore, there are five chickens and twelve ducks following the original three chickens and six ducks that were already in the field.
Response:  We have five hens and three roosters in the farmyard. Then four more chickens come to follow them. How many more chickens are there than those who are already in the farmyard?  To find this out, we need to subtract the number of chickens already in the farmyard from the total number of chickens that will be following them. So, the answer is: 5 + 3 = 8 (chickens already in the farmyard) - 4 = 4 (more chickens that will follow). Therefore, there are 4 more chickens than those who are already in the farmyard.
Response:  We have 6 pelicans and 2 poultry (chickens) sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more chickens arrive. How many more pelicans are there than chickens sitting on the fence?  To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of chickens from the total number of birds sitting on the fence. So, the answer is: 6 - 2 = 4 more pelicans than chickens sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three hens and six roosters in total. Since there are more roosters than hens, we can say that $ \frac{6}{3} = 2$ roosters are more than the number of hens. Therefore, $ 2 \times 2 = 4 $ roosters are more than the number of hens.
Response:  The first head has 48 pages, and the second head has 11 pages. To find out how many pages the first head has after the second head, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second head from the total number of pages in the first head. So, the answer is:  First head pages = 48 - 11 = 37 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many pages the second chapter is longer than the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. So, the difference between the two chapters is: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, the second chapter is 43 pages longer than the first chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 60 pages, and there are total 93 pages in the book. So, the number of pages in the second chapter is: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages.
Response:  The book has two chapters and the second chapter is 36 pages long. So, if we multiply the number of pages in the second chapter by 2, we get 72 pages for both chapters combined. Since there are 67 total pages in the book, we can deduce that the first chapter must have had 9 pages (67 - 72 = 9).
Response:  The first head has 66 pages, the second head has 35 pages, and the third head has 24 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. So, the book has 125 pages.
Response:  The book has three chapters with the following page counts: Chapter 1 - 91 pages Chapter 2 - 23 pages Chapter 3 - 25 pages Therefore, the total number of pages in chapter 1 is: 91 pages So, the number of pages in chapter 2 is: 23 pages minus 91 pages = 68 pages Finally, the number of pages in chapter 3 is: 25 pages So, the total number of pages in chapter 2 is: 68 pages + 25 pages = 93 pages
Response:  The first head has 35 pages, and we know that the second head has 18 pages less than the third head. So, if the third head has x pages, then the second head has x - 18 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second head is 18 + (x - 18) = x pages.
Response:  The first head has 53 pages, and we know that it is less than the total number of pages in the book (which is 3 x 100 = 300). So, the second head must have at least 300 - 53 = 247 pages. Similarly, the third head must have at least 247 - 75 = 172 pages. Therefore, the first head has 53 pages, the second head has 247 pages, and the third head has 172 pages.
Response:  We know that each chapter has 61 pages and there are 31 chapters in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages as follows: Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, the number of pages in this book is: Number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages
Response:  The book has 2 heads and 23 pages in total. Since the first head is 10 pages long, we can find out how many pages are left for the second head as follows: Number of pages left = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the first head = 23 - 10 = 13 pages So, the first head contains 10 pages, and the remaining 13 pages are divided between the two heads, making each head contain 6.5 pages ( rounded to nearest whole number). Therefore, the first head contains 10 pages, and the second head contains 6 pages.
Response:  The book has two chapters and each chapter has 81 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:  Number of pages in first chapter = 81 pages Number of pages in second chapter = 81 pages x 2 = 162 pages Total number of pages in the book = 81 + 162 = 243 pages So, the second chapter has 243 pages.
Response:  We know that 62 people went for breakfast and 39 people went for lunch. To find out how many more people went for breakfast than lunch, we need to subtract the number of people who went for lunch from the number of people who went for breakfast:  62 - 39 = 23 Therefore, 23 more people went for breakfast than lunch.
Response:  We know that there were 52 people who went for breakfast and 61 people who went for lunch. To find out how many more people went for lunch than breakfast, we need to subtract the number of people who went for breakfast from the number of people who went for lunch:  61 - 52 = 9  Therefore, 9 more people went for lunch than breakfast.
Response:  If 15 people went for breakfast and some of them also went to work, then we can assume that at most 15/2 = 7.5 people could have gone to work after breakfast. Therefore, if 32 catastrophists went out to work that day, the maximum number of catastrophists who could have gone to work after breakfast is 32 / 7.5 = 4.  So, 4 catastrophists went to work after breakfast.
Response:  If 15 people went for breakfast and 7 people went for lunch, then in total, 22 people (15 + 7) went out to eat that day.
Response:  We know that there were 36 people who went for breakfast and 13 people who went for lunch. So, the total number of people who went for meals is:  36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, 49 kataiskinotites (people) went for meals.
Response:  We know that there were 44 people who went for breakfast and 31 people who went for dinner. So, in total, there were 75 people (44 + 31) who went out to eat. Now, we want to find out how many more people went for breakfast than for dinner. To do this, we need to subtract the number of people who went for dinner from the number of people who went for breakfast:  75 - 31 = 44 Therefore, 44 more people went for breakfast than for dinner.
Response:  We know that there were 53 people who went for breakfast and 48 people who went for lunch. So, the difference between the number of people who went for breakfast and lunch is:  53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, more people went for breakfast than for lunch (by 5).
Response:  We know that there were 33 people who went for breakfast and 34 people who went for lunch. So, the difference between the number of people who went for breakfast and lunch is:  33 - 34 = -1. Therefore, more people went for breakfast than for lunch.
Response:  We know that there were 13 people who went for exercise and 59 people who went for work in the morning. Therefore, the number of people who went for exercise is 13.
Response:  We know that 29 people went for exercise and 66 people went for work in the morning.  Therefore, we can say that more than half of the people (35) went for exercise in the morning compared to those who went for work.
Response:  We know that there were 41 people who went for exercise and 4 people who went for transportation in the morning.  Therefore, the number of people who went for exercise is 41.  Now, we are asked how many people went for exercise and transportation combined.  To find this, we need to add the number of people who went for exercise (41) and those who went for transportation (4).  So, the total number of people who went for both exercise and transportation is 45.
Response:  We know that 43 cat skinners went for breakfast and some others also went for lunch. So, we can say that at least 43 cat skinners went for breakfast. Therefore, the number of cat skinners who went for lunch is less than or equal to 43.
Response:  If Reitsel removed 4 apples from the tree and initially the tree had 7 apples, then there are now 3 apples left in the tree (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  At first, the tree had 4 apples. Then, it lost some apples and now has 2 remaining. So, the number of apples that were removed is equal to the initial number of apples minus the current number of apples. In other words, the number of apples that were removed is 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, the woman removed 2 apples from the tree.
"Response:  The tree had 7 apples initially and now it has 5 apples left. If 3 of those are ripe and the remaining ones are rotten, then we can say that the number of ripe apples is equal to the number of rotten apples plus 3 (since there were originally 3 ripe apples). Therefore, the number of rotten apples is:

Number of rotten apples = Number of ripe apples - 3
= 5 - 3
= 2

So, the tree has 2 rotten apples left."
Response:  At first, Reitsel had two apples in her tree. Now she has seven apples in total. If six of them are ripe and the remaining one is not yet ripe, then how many ripe apples did Reitsel have at the beginning? We can conclude that Reitsel had three ripe apples at the start since there were only two apples in the tree initially, and now there are six ripe ones. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  At first, there were 6 apples in the tree. Then, 3 apples fell off, leaving 3 apples in the tree. Now, there are 2 apples left in the tree and 4 apples on the ground. So, initially, there were 6 apples in the tree.
Response:  At first, there were three apples in the tree (as stated in the question). Then, Reitsel picked two apples from the tree, leaving it with 2 apples. Finally, she added 27 more apples to the tree, making it have a total of 35 apples now. So, the number of apples that the tree had before Reitsel started picking them is 3 - 2 = 1.
Response:  At first, Reitsel had 7 apples in the tree. After that, two new apples grew in the tree. Now, the tree has 9 apples in total. So, at the beginning, the tree had 7 apples.
Response:  At first, there were two apples in the tree of Reitsel. Then, four more apples were picked from the tree. After that, three new apples grew in the tree. So, how many apples are there now? Well, let's see... Initially, there were 2 apples + 4 apples = 6 apples in total. Now, we have 6 apples + 3 new apples = 9 apples in total! Therefore, there are 9 apples in the tree of Reitsel right now.
Response:  The tree had 52 apples initially. Two apples were picked from it. Now the tree has 7 apples remaining. To find out how many apples the tree had at the beginning, we can use the following equation: Number of apples = Initial number of apples - Apples picked So, in this case, the number of apples the tree had at the beginning is: Number of apples = 52 - 2 = 48 Therefore, the tree had 48 apples at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Reitsel has 3 apple trees and she picked 8 apples from each tree. So, in total, she picked 24 apples. Now, we are asked how many apples were there initially in all the trees combined. To find this out, we need to multiply the number of trees by the initial number of apples in each tree. Since there were 3 trees, the total initial number of apples was 3 x 9 = 27 apples. Therefore, the correct answer is 27.
Response:  The tree has 4 apple trees and it picked 7 apples from each tree. So, in total, it picked 28 apples (4 x 7 = 28). Therefore, the tree now has 29 apples (28 + 1 = 29) more than before.
Response:  At first, we know that Ο Εντ had two more balls than Νταγκ. So, initially, Ο Εντ had 20 balls and Νδαγκ had 18 balls. Then, Νδαγκ lost some of his balls in the children's playground. We don't know exactly how many balls he lost, but let's assume it was 3 balls. Now, Νδαγκ has 15 balls left, and Ο Εντ still has 20 balls. Therefore, Ο Εντ gained 5 more balls than Νδαγκ (20 - 15 = 5).
Response:  We know that Ο Εντ had 10 more balls than Νταγκ. So, if Νδαγκ had 11 fewer balls than the child in the playground, then Ο Εντ must have had 21 balls (10 + 11 = 21). Now we are asked how many more balls Ο Εντ had than Νδαγκ. Since Ο Εντ had 21 balls and Νδαγκ had 11 balls less, the difference between their number of balls is 10 (21 - 11 = 10). Therefore, Ο Εντ had 10 more balls than Νδαγκ.
Response:  We know that Εντ has 6 more balls than Dang. So, if Ente had 22 balls in total, then Dang must have had 16 balls (22 - 6 = 16).
Response:  We know that Εντ had 5 more balls than Dog. So, if Ενт had 27 balls in total, then Dog must have had 22 balls (since he lost 3).
"Response:  We know that Δαγκ had 24 balls more than Enzo. So, if Enzo found 9 additional balls, then he initially had x fewer balls than Δαγκ. Since Enzo now has 27 balls (including the 9 he found), we can set up the equation:

x + 9 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18

So, Enzo initially had 18 fewer balls than Δαγκ. Therefore, Enzo had 256 - 18 = 238 balls more than Δαγκ."
Response:  We know that Ο Εντ had 29 balls more than Νταγκ. So, if Εντ had 35 balls in total (including the ones he gave to his son), then Νταγκ must have had 16 balls in total (since he had 17 less than Εντ). Therefore, Ο Εντ had 19 balls more than Νταγκ (35 - 16 = 19).
Response:  At first, we know that Ο Εντ had 19 more balls than Νταγκ. Then, he lost some of his balls in the children's playground. Now, he has 8 balls above Νdtagk. So, we can calculate how many balls he lost as follows:  Number of balls Εντ had initially = 19 - Number of balls Εντ lost = 8 Therefore, Εντ lost 11 balls (19 - 8).
Response:  We know that Enzo had 30 more balls than Dog. If Enzo lost 21 of his balls in the children's park, then he has 9 less balls than Dog. So, the difference between the number of balls Enzo and Dog have is 9. Therefore, Enzo has 91 - 9 = 82 more balls than Dog.
Response:  We know that Εντ had 12 more balls than Dang. So, if Εντ had 20 balls in total, then he must have had 32 balls initially (since he had 12 more than Dang). Now, we are asked how many balls Dang has now. Since Dang had 17 balls initially and Εντ gave him 5 balls, Dang now has 17 + 5 = 22 balls.
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding feta cheese and 42 students suggested adding beef to the menu, then we have a total of 450 suggestions for new dishes (408 + 42). Since there are more than twice as many students who suggested feta cheese as those who suggested beef, we can conclude that if all 450 students had their way, feta cheese would likely be added to the menu more often than beef. Therefore, the correct answer is: Feta cheese.
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding feta cheese and 489 students suggested adding beef to the menu, then we have a total of 968 suggestions (479 + 489 = 968). Now, let's assume that among these suggestions, there are more than 200 students who suggested adding feta cheese. Therefore, if we add up all the suggestions for feta cheese, we get: 479 x 200 = 95,800. Similarly, if we add up all the suggestions for beef, we get: 489 x 100 = 48,900. So, in total, there were 95,800 votes for feta cheese and 48,900 votes for beef.
Response:  Since there were 310 students in total, and 185 of them suggested adding potatoes to the menu, we can say that 56% (185/310) of the students wanted to add potatoes. Therefore, 44% (310-185) of the students did not want to add potatoes.
Response:  Since there were 288 students in total, and 264 of them suggested adding beef to the menu, we can say that 79% (or 0.79) of the students wanted beef added. Therefore, 21% (or 0.21) of the students did not want beef added or suggested other options like potatoes.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding feta cheese and 284 suggested adding beef, then there were 457 + 284 = 741 suggestions in total. Of these, if 63 more students suggested adding feta cheese than those who suggested adding beef (i.e., 63 > 28), then the number of students who suggested adding feta cheese is 741 - 28 = 713.
Response:  If 182 students proposed adding feta cheese and 45 proposed adding beef, then among those who proposed adding feta cheese, how many proposed adding it more than once?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of students who proposed adding feta cheese more than once = Total number of students who proposed adding feta cheese - Number of students who only proposed adding feta cheese once. So, in this case, that would be: Number of students who proposed adding feta cheese more than once = 182 - 45 = 137.
Response:  If Sophia asked 324 students to suggest three dishes for lunch and 374 of them suggested adding potatoes, then there are 374 + 324 = 698 suggestions in total. Moreover, if 128 students suggested adding breadsticks, then there are 698 + 128 = 826 suggestions in total. Therefore, the number of students who participated in the survey is 826.
Response:  If 257 students suggested adding potatoes to their menus and 120 of them suggested adding beef, then there are 257 + 120 = 377 suggestions for adding protein-rich foods in total.  Similarly, if 97 students suggested adding bread, then there are 97 + 120 = 217 suggestions for adding carbohydrate-rich foods in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of students who suggested adding potatoes (120) and those who suggested adding bread (97) is 120 - 97 = 23.
Response:  If 144 students suggested adding potatoes to their sandwiches, and there are 467 students in total, then the number of students who suggested adding beef to their sandwiches is (467 - 144) = 323. Similarly, if 79 students suggested adding cheese to their sandwiches, and there are 467 students in total, then the number of students who did not suggest adding any ingredients is (467 - 79 - 144) = 254.
Response:  If 228 students suggested adding more cheese to the menu and 337 students suggested adding more beef, then there are a total of 565 suggestions for adding protein to the menu (228 + 337 = 565). Additionally, if 23 students suggested adding more vegetables, then there are a total of 588 suggestions for adding ingredients to the menu (565 + 23 = 588).
Response:  If 450 students were asked to suggest three food items they would like to add to their meal plan, and if 38 of them suggested adding beef, while the remaining students did not participate in the survey, then we can calculate the percentage of students who participated in the survey as follows: (Number of participants in the survey / Total number of students) x 100 = 38/450 x 100 = 8.4% Therefore, approximately 8.4% of the students participated in the survey.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potatoes and beef to the menu while 351 students only suggested adding beef, then we can conclude that:  Number of students who suggested adding both potatoes and beef = Total number of students - Number of students who suggested adding only beef. So, in this case, the number of students who suggested adding both potatoes and beef is: 218 + 351 = 569. Therefore, 569 students suggested adding both potatoes and beef to the menu.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding beef to the menu, and 330 students suggested adding potatoes, then there are a total of 599 suggestions for adding different types of meat or vegetables to the menu.  Furthermore, if 76 students suggested adding more domates (a type of eggplant), then there are a total of 675 suggestions for adding different types of food to the menu.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 569 - 236 = 333 So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. So, if we want to find out how many boys have more than one sister, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of boys who have more than one sister is:

$$ \text {Number of boys} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of girls} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of boys} = 841 - 34 = 797 $$

Therefore, there are $797$ boys in the school who have more than one sister."
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys at this school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in the school and we want to find out how many more than or equal to 228 boys there are in the school. So, let's subtract 228 from 697: 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school who are either older than or equal to 228 years old.
Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total and that 510 of them are girls. So, we need to find out how many boys there are. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Now, let's substitute the values we have been given into the equation: Number of boys = 635 - 510 = 125 Therefore, there are 125 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and that 281 of them are girls. So, we have to find out how many boys there are. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equation: Number of boys = 868 - 281 = 587 Therefore, there are 587 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls in the school and we want to find out how many more than 142 boys there are. So, if there are x boys, then the total number of students is 700 + x. Since we know that the total number of students is 700 + 142 = 842, we can set up the equation: 700 + x = 842. Now we solve for x: x = 842 - 700 = 142. Therefore, there are 142 more boys than girls in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in the school.  Of these, 418 students attended school. Therefore, we can calculate the number of non-attending students as follows: Number of non-attending students = Total number of students - Number of attending students = 706 - 418 = 288 Now, we have to find out how many male and female non-attending students there are. To do this, we need to divide the total number of non-attending students by 2 (since there are equal numbers of males and females). So, the number of male non-attending students is: Male non-attending students = Total number of non-attending students / 2 = 288 / 2 = 144 And the number of female non-attending students is: Female non-attending students = Total number of non-attending students / 2 = 288 / 2 = 144 Therefore, there are 144 male and 144 female non-attending students in the school at present.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. 44 of them have proscholized (i.e., they have been promoted to high school). So, we need to find out how many students remain in the school after these promotions. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining students = Total number of students - Number of promoted students In our case, the total number of students is 902 + 811 = 1713. Now, we subtract the number of promoted students (44) from the total number of students: Number of remaining students = 1713 - 44 = 1670 Therefore, there are 1670 students left in the school after the promotions.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Since 465 students attended the school, we can say that 465 = 632 + x, where x is the number of boys who did not attend the school. Therefore, the number of boys who did not attend the school is equal to 632 - 465 = 167. So, more than twice as many girls as boys attended the school.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school.  Of these, 682 girls and 8 boys have attended school so far. So, the number of girls who haven't attended school is:  Number of girls = Total number of girls - Number of girls who attended school = 732 - 682 = 50 girls. Similarly, the number of boys who haven't attended school is: Number of boys = Total number of boys - Number of boys who attended school = 761 - 8 = 753 boys. Therefore, there are 50 girls and 753 boys currently attending the school.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school initially.  Since 496 girls and 910 boys attended school, we can calculate the number of remaining girls as follows: Number of remaining girls = Initial number of girls - Number of girls who attended school = 135 - 496 = 361 So, there are 361 girls in the school currently. Similarly, we can find out the number of boys as follows: Number of remaining boys = Initial number of boys - Number of boys who attended school = 214 - 910 = 796 So, there are 796 boys in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. How many students are there in total? To find this out, we need to add the number of girls and boys together: 308 + 318 = 626. So, there are 626 students in the school. Now, let's see how many teachers there are. According to the question, there are 36 teachers in the school. How many students do each teacher teach? To find this out, we can divide the number of teachers by the total number of students: 36 / 626 = 0.057 (or approximately 1 student per teacher).
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is: 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of girls to teachers is: 315/772 = 0.418 (or approximately 41.8%). Similarly, the ratio of boys to teachers is: 309/772 = 0.405 (or approximately 40.5%).
Response:  We know that there are 402 girls in the school more than boys. If we have 739 students in total, then the number of boys is equal to 739 - 402 = 337. So, there are 337 boys in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are currently 458 students in the school who are older than 10 years old. If we add 692 new students to this number, then the total number of students in the school will be:

458 + 692 = 1140

So, there will be 1140 students in the school if 692 new students join it."
"Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in the school.  Since 403 girls attended school, we can say that the number of girls who did not attend school is equal to the total number of students minus the number of girls who attended school:

Number of girls who did not attend school = Total number of students - Number of girls who attended school
= 362 + 257 = 619

So, there are 619 more girls than boys in the school."
Response:  At first, Εντούαρντ had $18 dollars. Then he lost $16 dollars. So, now he has $18 - $16 = $2 dollars left.
Response:  Initially, Ender had $13. He spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, the amount of money he spent is $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Initially, Ender had $9 dollars. After he spent some money, he had $8 less than that amount. So, his new balance is $9 - $8 = $1. Therefore, Ender initially had $9 dollars.
Response:  Before spending $16 to buy 92 books, Edward had $6. So, he had $6 + $16 = $22 in total before making the purchase.
Response:  The first book cost $6, and he spent all of his money to buy it. So, he has no money left to buy the second book. Therefore, the cost of the second book is $0.
Response:  Before spending $6 for books and $16 for style, Εntouard had $19 dollars. So, he had $19 + ($6 x 2) = $19 + $12 = $31 dollars before spending the money on the leftovers.
Response:  The Endurant spent $4 for books and $3 for styling. So he has $4 + $3 = $7 left after buying those things. Therefore, he spent $7 for books and styling.
Response:  Initially, Ender had $16 for books and $8 for styling. So he had a total of $24. Now, he has $19 more than that, which means he has $53 in total ($24 + $19). Therefore, Ender spent more money on books than on styling.
Response:  Initially, Endouard had $17 dollars. Then he lost $10 due to his friend taking it away from him. Now he has $7 left. So, initially Endouard had $17 - $10 = $7 dollars.
Response:  We know that Ζάχαρι made 44 jumps in the gym today and Δείβιντ made 58 more than Zákri. So, if we call the number of jumps made by Zákri x, then the number of jumps made by Déivintex is x + 58. Therefore, the total number of jumps made by both boys is x + (x + 58) = 2x + 58. Solving for x, we get x = 19. So, Zákri made 19 jumps and Déivintex made 77 jumps (77 = 58 + 19).
Response:  We know that Zachari made 51 jumps and David made 44 jumps in the gym today. To find out how many more jumps Zachari did than David, we need to subtract the number of jumps David made from the number of jumps Zachari made: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachari did 7 more jumps than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 jumps in the gym today and 9 more than Zachary. So, if David made x jumps, then Zachary made x - 9 jumps. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 44 = x + 9. Solving for x, we get: x = 35. So, Zachary made 35 jumps in the gym today.
Response:  We know that David made 51 jumps in the gym today and Zakari made 49 more than David. So, Zakari made 51 + 49 = 100 jumps in total. Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  We know that Zachari made 59 jumps and Davide made 19 more than Zachari. So, Davide made 59 + 19 = 78 jumps.
Response:  We know that Zachari made 44 jumps and 17 grimaces in the gym today. David made 29 more jumps than Zachari, but 13 fewer grimaces. So, we can write an equation:  Number of jumps = 44 + (29 - 13) = 64. Therefore, David made 64 jumps.
"Response:  We know that Zachari made 53 jumps and 14 grenades in the gym today. David made 17 more jumps than Zachari, but 10 fewer grenades. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

Zachari's jumps = 53
David's jumps = 53 + 17 = 70
David's grenades =?
We are given that David had 10 fewer grenades than Zachari, so we can subtract 10 from his total number of grenades to find out how many he actually made:

David's grenades = 70 - 10 = 60
Therefore, Zachari made 53 jumps and 14 grenades, while David made 70 jumps and 60 grenades."
Response:  We know that Zachari made 35 jumps and 3 grenades in the gym today. David made 58 more jumps than Zachari, but 87 fewer than him. So, if Zachari made x jumps, then David made 58 + x jumps. Therefore, we can write an equation: 58 + x = 87. Solving for x, we get: x = 29. So, Zachari made 29 more jumps than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 46 push-ups and David made 38 more than Zachary. So, David made 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary made 46 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Ζάχαρι made 19 push-ups in the gym today.  We also know that Δείβιντ made more than 39 push-ups compared to Ζάχαρι. Therefore, we can conclude that Δείβιντ made at least 39 + 1 = 40 push-ups. So, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Zachari made 51 push-ups in the gym today. David made 22 more than Zachari, so he made 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Jon did fewer push-ups than David, 4 less to be exact, so he made 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, Jon made 69 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Ζάχαρι (Zachari) made 15 push-ups in the gym today.  We also know that Δείβιντ (Deivid) did 39 more push-ups than Zachari. Therefore, Deivid did 39 + 15 = 54 push-ups. Now we need to find out how many fewer push-ups Zachari did compared to Jon. We are told that Zachari did 9 fewer push-ups than Jon. So, Zachari did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups fewer than Jon.
Response:  If David made 30 more flips than Zakri in gym class today, that means David made 30 + X flips, where X is the number of flips Zakri made. Since we know that David made 30 more flips than Zakri, we can set up an equation as follows: 30 + X = 30 + 37. Solving for X, we get: X = 37 - 30 = 7. So, Zakri made 7 flips in gym class today.
Response:  If David made 56 more shots than Zachary in gym class today, that means David made 32 shots (56 - 24). Now, we know that Zachary made 38 shots. So, the difference between their number of shots is:  38 - 32 = 6. Therefore, Zachary made 6 more shots than David.
Response:  We know that David made 40 more shots than Zachary in the gym today. So, if Zachary made 34 shots, then David must have made 74 shots (40 + 34 = 74). Now, we are also given that David made 17 fewer free throws than Zachary. So, if Zachary made 62 free throws, then David must have made 45 free throws (62 - 17 = 45). Therefore, the final answer is: 74 shots and 45 free throws.
"Response: Δevin made 36 more shots than Zakari in the gym today. If Devin made 58 shots and Zakari made 33 shots, then the difference between their number of shots is:

$$ \text {Difference} = \text{Devin's number of shots} - \text{Zakari's number of shots} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text{Difference} = 58 - 33 = 25 $$

Therefore, Devin made $25$ more shots than Zakari in the gym today."
"Response:  We know that David made 27 more shots than Zakari in the gym today. So, if David made x shots and Zakari made y shots, we can write an equation:
x - y = 27
We also know that David made 7 fewer dunks than Zakari. So, if David made x dunks and Zakari made y dunks, we can write another equation:
x - y = -7
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method?"
Response:  According to the problem, Reitsel had to make 5 pages of math and 2 pages of reading comprehension. So, in total, he made 7 pages (5 + 2). Now, we need to find out how many more pages of math he made than of reading comprehension. To do this, we subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension from the number of pages of math: 7 - 2 = 5. Therefore, Reitsel made 5 more pages of math than of reading comprehension.
Response:  The girl wanted to make 3 pages of math and 4 pages of reading comprehension. If she had more than enough material for the math pages, then we can say that the number of pages of reading comprehension she had was equal to the number of math pages minus the number of pages she had enough material for. So, if she had enough material for 2 math pages, then she had 3 - 2 = 1 page of reading comprehension. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 page.
Response:  If Reitsel could make 5 pages of math and more than that in reading comprehension, then it means she could make a total of 7 pages (the number of pages she needs to complete) if she made half as many pages in each subject. So, the answer is 3.5 pages (7 pages / 2 = 3.5 pages).
Response:  If Reitsel completed 7 pages of math problems and needed to complete 4 more pages than her reading comprehension exercises, then she needs to complete 11 pages (7 + 4) of math problems.
Response:  If Reitsel had to make 8 pages of math exercises and he completed 3 pages more than the required number of exercises for each subject, then we can calculate the total number of pages he completed as follows: Total pages = (Number of subjects x Number of pages per subject) + (Number of extra pages completed) In this case, there are 3 subjects in total, so the total number of pages is: Total pages = (3 x 4 pages/subject) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15 pages So, Reitsel completed 15 pages of math exercises in total.
Response:  If Reitsel could make 8 pages of math problems and needed to complete at least 6 more than the math problems, then we can calculate how many pages she needs to complete as follows: Number of pages Reitsel needs to complete = Total number of pages - Number of pages completed (8) So in this case, if Reitsel made 8 pages of math problems, then she needs to complete an additional 6 pages, for a total of 14 pages. Therefore, the answer is 14 pages.
Response:  If she completed 10 pages of math problems and needed to complete at least 3 more pages than the math problems, then she needs to complete 13 pages (10 + 3 = 13).
"Response:  The girl wants to make 2 pages of math, 3 pages of reading comprehension and 10 pages of biology. To find out how many total pages she needs to make, we can multiply each type of page by the number of pages she wants to make:

* Math pages x 2 = 4 pages
* Reading comprehension pages x 3 = 9 pages
* Biology pages x 10 = 100 pages

So, in total, the girl needs to make 106 pages (4 + 9 + 100)."
Response:  The girl had to make 9 pages of math, 2 pages of reading comprehension, and 96 pages of biology. To find out how many more pages of math she had to make than of reading comprehension, we can subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension from the total number of pages of math: 9 - 2 = 7 pages of math left to make. Therefore, the girl had to make at least 7 more pages of math than of reading comprehension.
Response:  The girl wants to make 11 pages of math, 2 pages of reading comprehension and 3 pages of biology. So, she needs a total of 16 pages (11 + 2 + 3). Therefore, she has more than 16 pages of math than biology.
Response:  The girl had to make 7 pages of math, 11 pages of reading comprehension, and other 8 pages of biology. So, she had in total 26 pages (7 + 11 + 8).
Response:  The girl wants to make 9 pages of math, 11 pages of reading and 29 pages of biology. To find out how many pages she needs to complete in total, we can multiply each number of pages by the corresponding subject. So, for math, it would be 9 x 9 = 81 pages, for reading it would be 11 x 11 = 121 pages, and for biology it would be 29 x 29 = 859 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 81 + 121 + 859 = 1061 pages.
Response:  The girl wants to make 8 pages of math, 7 pages of reading and 3 pages of biology. To find out how many pages she needs to complete in total, we can multiply each number of pages by the corresponding subject area. So, for math, she needs to make 8 x 8 = 64 pages, for reading, she needs to make 7 x 7 = 49 pages, and for biology, she needs to make 3 x 3 = 9 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 64 + 49 + 9 = 122 pages.
Response:  The girl wants to read 5 pages of math, 10 pages of reading comprehension and other 6 pages of biology. So in total she needs to read 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages.
Response:  The girl wanted to make 2 pages of reading and 4 pages of math problems. So, she had more than 4 pages of math problems if she made 6 pages in total (2 + 4 = 6). Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
"Response:  The girl wanted to read 4 pages of reading comprehension, 7 pages of math, and 19 pages of biology. To find out how many more pages of math she wanted to read than pages of reading comprehension, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension from the total number of pages she wanted to read:

Total pages = Reading comprehension + Math + Biology
= 4 + 7 + 19
= 30

Number of more pages of math = Total pages - Pages of reading comprehension
= 30 - 4
= 26

So, the girl wanted to read 26 more pages of math than pages of reading comprehension."
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 in the afternoon, that means he received a total of 8 emails (6 + 2 = 8). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Wednesday morning (the day of the mail), Jack received 6 emails before noon and 8 after noon. So, in total, he received 14 emails that day.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some of them were spam, then he received at most 4 non-spam emails. So, if he received 5 emails that day, at least 1 of them was spam. Therefore, Jack received 4 non-spam emails.
Response:  On Monday morning (3 am), Jack received 6 emails. Then he went to bed at 5 pm and slept for 8 hours. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 emails that day.
Response:  On Wednesday morning (8 am), Jack received 5 emails. So, he received 5 emails in total that day. Since there are 144 minutes in an hour, and 60 minutes in a standard working hour, we can calculate the number of emails Jack received per hour as follows: Number of emails/Number of hours = 5/144 = 0.0357 (approximately 0.36) emails per hour. Therefore, Jack received approximately 0.36 emails per hour on Wednesday morning.
Response:  On Wednesday (8), Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 4 more in the evening, for a total of 8 emails. So, he received 8 emails that day.
Response:  On Wednesday morning (4 o'clock), Jack received 3 emails. So, he received a total of 3 + 0 = 3 emails that day. In the evening (8 o'clock), Jack did not receive any new emails since he already had 3 emails in his inbox at that time. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received that day is 3.
Response:  On Wednesday morning (7 am), Jack received 10 emails and on Thursday evening (7 pm), he received another 17 emails. So in total, Jack received 27 emails between Wednesday morning and Thursday evening.
Response:  On Wednesday morning (at 10 am), Jack received 9 emails and on Wednesday evening (at 7 pm), he received 7 more emails. So, in total, Jack received 9 + 7 = 16 emails that day.
Response:  On Wednesday morning (5 o'clock), Jack received 10 emails and on Wednesday evening (9 o'clock), he received 4 more emails. So in total, Jack received 10 + 4 = 14 emails that day.
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 in the afternoon and a few in the evening, then he received a total of 10 emails that day. So, Jack received 5 emails in the evening (since there are 5 hours between the end of the afternoon and the beginning of the evening). Therefore, Jack received 5 + 6 = 11 emails that day.
Response:  At first, Jack received 3 emails and 64 characters in the morning. Then he received 5 more emails and 54 additional characters after lunch. So, in total, Jack received 8 (3 + 5) emails and 118 (64 + 54) characters that day.
Response:  On day one, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. After that, he received 9 more emails and 7 more letters. So in total, Jack received 14 emails (5 + 9 = 14) and 13 letters (6 + 7 = 13).
Response:  At first, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. Then he received 3 more emails after lunchtime. So, the total number of emails Jack received after lunchtime is 3 + 10 = 13 emails. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and after lunchtime is 13 - 10 = 3 additional emails.
Response:  At first, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. Then he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters after lunch. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails and 8 + 7 = 15 letters after lunch. Therefore, Jack received more letters than emails after lunch.
Response:  On day one, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters. So he received 91/6 = 15.17 emails per hour (round to 15 emails per hour).  On the second day, Jack received 2 emails and sent 74 letters. So he received 2/1 = 2 emails per hour (round to 2 emails per hour). Therefore, in total, Jack received 15 + 2 = 17 emails that day.
Response:  On day one, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters. So far, he has exchanged 4 + 2 = 6 messages. Then, on the next day, he received 6 more emails and sent 8 letters. Therefore, in total, Jack exchanged 6 + 8 = 14 messages over the two days.
Response:  If Jack received 9 emails that day and he received 7 emails in the morning, then he must have received 2 additional emails after noon (since 9 - 7 = 2). So, Jack received 2 emails after noon.
Response:  On Monday morning (08:00), Jack received 3 emails and in the evening he received another 5 emails, making it a total of 8 emails that day. Then, on Tuesday, he received 16 more emails, bringing the total number of emails he received to 24. So, the answer is 24.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails at 6 am and some more in the evening, then he received a total of 10 emails that day. So, Jack received 10 emails that day.
Response:  The difference between the number of inches that the crab and the turtle moved is given as follows: Δ = 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, the distance traveled by the crab was 3 inches more than the distance traveled by the turtle.
Response:  The squirrel ran 35 inches and the acorn tree grew 31 inches. So, in total, they both ran/grew 66 inches (35 + 31).
Response:  The crab moved 17 inches further away from the anemone than the octopus did. So, if the distance between the crab and the anemone was x, then the distance between the crab and the octopus would be x + 17. Therefore, the distance that the crab moved is 17 inches.
Response:  The crab moved 18 inches further away from the anemone than the octopus did. So, if the distance between the crab and the anemone was x, then the distance between the octopus and the anemone is x - 18. Therefore, the distance that the octopus moved was 2(x-18) = 2x - 36. Since the octopus moved less than the crab, the distance that the octopus moved is smaller than the distance that the crab moved. So, the answer is 2x - 36 < 25. Simplifying this inequality, we get 2x < 51. Solving for x, we find that the octopus moved 10 inches away from the anemone.
Response:  The crab moved 10 inches closer to the anemone than the octopus did. So, if the distance between the crab and the anemone is x, then the distance between the octopus and the anemone is x + 10. Therefore, the difference in distance between the octopus and the anemone and the anemone and the crab is 20 - (x + 10).
Response:  The crab moved 39 inches further away from the anemone than the octopus did. So, if the distance between the crab and the anemone was x, then we can say that the distance between the crab and the octopus is x + 39. Therefore, the distance traveled by the crab is 94 - (x + 39) = 55 inches.
Response:  The crab moved 32 inches further away from the anemone than the octopus did. So, if the distance between the anemone and the crab was x, then the distance between the anemone and the octopus is x - 26 = 8. Therefore, the distance between the anemone and the octopus is 8 inches.
Response:  The crab moved 33 inches further than the anemone and the turtle moved 5 inches less than the crab. So, if the distance between the anemone and the crab is x, then the distance between the anemone and the turtle is x - 5. Therefore, the distance between the anemone and the turtle is 38 inches (x - 5).
Response:  The crab and the turtle had an athletic competition. The crab jumped 13 inches. The distance between the crab and the turtle was 5 times longer than the distance between the crab and the starting point. How far did the turtle move?  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that the crab jumped 13 inches, which means it moved 13 inches away from its starting point. We also know that the distance between the crab and the turtle is 5 times longer than the distance between the crab and the starting point. So, if the distance between the crab and the starting point is x, then the distance between the crab and the turtle is 5x. Therefore, the distance the turtle moved can be calculated as follows: Distance = 5x - 13 inches.
Response:  The bat and the tortoise had an athletic competition. The hare (bat) ran 35 times around the track. The hare (bat) then ran 10 times further away from the starting point than it was originally. How far did they run in total?  To find out how far the hare (bat) ran in total, we need to add up all its runs. So, the hare (bat) ran a total of 45 times around the track (35 + 10).
Response:  The bat and the frog had an athletic competition. The acridia won 19 inches. The acridia moved 10 times farther away from the bat than the frog and the frog moved 15 times farther away from the bat than the acridia. How far did the bat move?
Response:  The difference between the number of inches that the bat and the frog jumped is given as 39 - 19 = 20 inches. Since the frog jumped less than the bat, we can say that the distance traveled by the frog is equal to the difference between their jumps minus the distance traveled by the bat. So, the distance traveled by the frog is 20 - 12 = 8 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 8 inches.
Response:  The crab and the turtle had an intense race. The crab moved 21 inches closer to the finish line. The crab moved 25 inches further away from the turtle and the turtle moved 16 inches less than the crab. How far did the crab move away from the turtle?
Response:  The bat and the tortoise had an athletic competition. The bat flew 39 meters and the tortoise ran 17 meters. How much farther away did the bat fly from the tortoise?
Response:  The bat and the frog had an athletic competition. The bat flew 9 inches away from its starting point. The frog jumped 10 feet less than the distance that the bat flew. Since the bat flew 15 feet further away from the acridia than the frog did, how far away from the acridia did the frog jump?  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that the bat flew 9 inches away from its starting point, so the distance between the bat and the acridia is 9 inches + 15 feet = 24 feet. Therefore, the frog jumped 24 feet - 10 feet = 14 feet away from the acridia.
Response:  The bat and the frog had an athletic competition. The bat jumped 14 inches. The frog jumped 16 inches less than the bat. How much further did the frog jump than the bat?
"Response:  Maíra has already put in 5 flitzians of almonds. To find out how many more she needs to add, we need to subtract the number of flitzians she has already added from the total amount required (14 flitzians). So, the number of additional flitzians Maíra needs to add is:

14 - 5 = 9

Therefore, Maíra needs to add 9 more flitzians of almonds."
"Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 4 liters of water to the mixture and we want to find out how many liters she needs to add more to make 11 liters in total. So, let's divide the desired amount (11 liters) by the amount she has already added (4 liters):

$$ \frac{11}{4} = 2.75 $$

So, Maíra needs to add $2.75$ liters of water to the mixture to reach her goal."
Response:  Maíra needs to make 6 flour tortillas and 13 corn tortillas. She has already mixed some dough with flour, water, salt, and oil. To determine how many more flour tortillas she needs to make, we need to subtract the number of tortillas she has already made from the total number of tortillas she needs to make. So, in this case, if she needs to make 6 flour tortillas more than corn tortillas, then she needs 6 x 4 = 24 more flour tortillas.
Response:  Maíra has already put in 5 almonds from the jar of 11 almonds and wants to know how many she still needs to add to make 7 zaharas (or 7 almonds). Since each zahara requires 3 almonds, Maíra needs to add 2 more almonds from the remaining 6 almonds in the jar. Therefore, the answer is 2 almonds.
Response:  Maíra needs to make 11 flour tortillas and she has already added 3 cups of flour. If she wants to add 6 more cups of flour, how many total cups of flour will she need?  We can calculate this as follows: Total cups of flour needed = Number of tortillas required x Amount of flour per tortilla Total cups of flour needed = 11 x 3/4 = 7 + 6 = 13 cups of flour So, according to the question, Maíra needs 13 cups of flour to make 11 flour tortillas.
Response:  Maíra has already put in 7 almonds (12 - 5 = 7). If she needs another 2 almonds, how many almonds did she put in total?  Therefore, the answer is 9 almonds (7 + 2 = 9).
Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 3 almonds and 62 hazelnuts to her jar. To find out how many more almonds she needs to add, we can use the following equation: Number of remaining almonds = Total number of almonds - Number of almonds already added Number of remaining hazelnuts = Total number of hazelnuts - Number of hazelnuts already added In this case, the total number of almonds is 9, and the number of almonds already added is 3, so the number of remaining almonds is: Number of remaining almonds = 9 - 3 = 6 Therefore, Maíra needs to add 6 more almonds to her jar. Similarly, for the hazelnuts, we have: Number of remaining hazelnuts = 5 - 62 = -57 Therefore, Maíra needs to remove 57 hazelnuts from her jar.
Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 10 almonds and 2 walnuts to her jar.  To find out how many walnuts she needs to add, we can use the information given in the problem:  The recipe requires 5 almonds and 14 walnuts. Since Maíra has already added 10 almonds, she still needs to add 5 more almonds. Therefore, the number of walnuts she needs to add is 14 - 10 = 4 walnuts. So, Maíra needs to add 4 walnuts to her jar.
Response:  Maíra needs to make 12 fritters and she has already made 11 of them. So, we need to find out how many more fritters she needs to make. To do this, we divide the total number of fritters needed (12) by the number of fritters she has made so far (11): Number of additional fritters = Total number of fritters / Number of fritters made so far = 12 / 11 = 1 Therefore, Maíra needs to make one more fritter.
Response:  Maíra has already added 7 liters of water to the tank, so we have a total volume of 7 + 10 = 17 liters in the tank now. To find out how many liters she needs to add more, we can subtract the current volume from the desired volume: 17 - 80 = -63 liters. So, Maíra needs to add 63 liters of water to the tank.
Response:  Maíra has already added 2 flitzians of almond syrup to her coffee, so we have: 12 - 2 = 10 flitzians of almond syrup left.  Now, we need to calculate how many more flitzians she needs to add to reach 14 flitzians of zahar in total.  We know that 1 flitzian of zahar is equal to 3 flitzians of almond syrup, so: 14 / 3 = 4 + 2 = 6 additional flitzians of almond syrup. Therefore, Maíra needs to add 6 more flitzians of almond syrup to her coffee.
Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 5 flitzians of almonds and she needs to add 3 more flitzians of almonds. So, the total number of flitzians of almonds needed is 5 + 3 = 8 flitzians of almonds.  Since each flitzian of almonds contains 4 flitzians of zahar, we need to multiply 8 flitzians of almonds by 4 flitzians of zahar per flitzian of almonds, which gives us 32 flitzians of zahar in total. Therefore, Maíra needs to add 32 - 5 = 27 flitzians of zahar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  Maíre needs to make 12 flour tortillas and 13 corn tortillas. She has already mixed 2 cups of masa harina (corn flour) with water to make the dough for the corn tortillas. To determine how many more cups of masa harina she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of masa harina used so far from the total amount needed. So, the number of additional cups of masa harina required is:

Total amount of masa harina needed = 12 x φλιτζάνια (flour tortillas) + 13 x φλιτζάνια (corn tortillas) = 156 φλιτζάνια
Amount of masa harina used so far = 2 φλιτζάνια
Number of additional cups of masa harina needed = Total amount of masa harina needed - Amount of masa harina used so far = 156 - 2 = 154 φλιτζάνια
Therefore, Maíre needs an additional 154 cups of masa harina to make all the tortillas she wants."
Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 4 flippers to her turkey. So, we need to find out how many more flippers she needs to add to make 9 flippers in total.  Since there are 6 flippers in each package of zahar, and Maíra has already used 4 of them, she still needs to add 2 packages of zahar (or 12 flippers) to reach her goal of 9 flippers. Therefore, Maíra needs to add 3 additional flippers of zahar.
Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 2 flitzians of almond syrup to her coffee.  To find out how many more flitzians she needs to add, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining flitzians = Total number of flitzians required - Number of flitzians already added So in this case, the total number of flitzians required is 9 (as stated in the problem), and Maíra has already added 2 flitzians, so the number of remaining flitzians is: Number of remaining flitzians = 9 - 2 = 7 Therefore, Maíra needs to add 7 more flitzians of almond syrup to her coffee.
"Response:  Maíra has already added 11 flitizanis of almond syrup and needs to add 4 more (since she wants to reach 15). So, we need to find out how many flitizanis of almond syrup are in 15. There are 10 flitizanis in one small glass of syrup, so:

15 / 10 = 1.5

Maíra needs to add 1.5 times 4 = 6 more flitizanis of almond syrup."
Response:  Maíra has already put in some flour (3 cups). If she needs another 5 cups of flour to make the dough, how many total cups of flour did she use? Therefore, the answer is 8 cups of flour (3 + 5 = 8).
Response:  Maíra has already put in 7 flippers (flitziáni) of zucchini and needs another 12 to complete the recipe. So, she has put in a total of 19 flippers of zucchini so far.
Response:  Maíra needs to make 14 flour tortillas and she has already mixed 7 of them. So, we need to find out how many more tortillas she needs to mix. We know that each tortilla requires 6 cups of flour, so we can calculate the total amount of flour needed as follows: Total amount of flour needed = Number of tortillas x Amount of flour per tortilla Total amount of flour needed = 14 tortillas x 6 cups/tortilla Total amount of flour needed = 84 cups of flour Now, we know that Maíra has already mixed 7 cups of flour, so we need to subtract this amount from the total amount of flour needed to find out how many more cups of flour are required: Number of additional cups of flour needed = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour already mixed Number of additional cups of flour needed = 84 cups - 7 cups = 77 cups of flour Therefore, Maíra needs to mix an additional 77 cups of flour to make the remaining 7 tortillas.
Response:  Maíra needs to make 11 flour tortillas and 9 corn tortillas. She has already made 12 flour tortillas and 10 corn tortillas. To find out how many more flour tortillas she needs to make, we need to subtract the number of tortillas she has already made from the total number of tortillas she needs to make. So, the answer is: 11 - 12 = -1 flour tortilla. Therefore, Maíra needs to make 1 more flour tortilla.
Response:  Maíra needs to make 3 flour tortillas and each one requires 10 eggs. She has already used 6 eggs. Therefore, she needs an additional 4 eggs (3 - 6 = 4).
Response:  Maíra has already added 4 flour cups (or 280 grams) to make the dough. To find out how many more flour cups she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount required. So, we have: Total amount of flour needed = 9 flour cups x 140 grams/flour cup = 1260 grams Total amount of flour added so far = 4 flour cups x 140 grams/flour cup = 560 grams Subtracting the amount of flour added from the total amount needed gives us the remaining amount of flour needed: Remaining amount of flour needed = Total amount of flour needed - Amount of flour added = 1260 grams - 560 grams = 700 grams Therefore, Maíra needs to add an additional 700 grams of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  Maíra has already added 2 flitzians of almond milk to her coffee, so we have: 9 - 2 = 7 flitzians of almond milk left. Now, according to the problem, she needs 7 + 4 = 11 flitzians of almond milk in total. Therefore, Maíra needs to add 4 more flitzians of almond milk to her coffee.
Response:  Maíra has already added 12 liters of water to the mixture. To find out how many liters of water she needs to add now, we need to subtract the amount of water she has already added from the total amount required (11 liters). So, Maíra needs to add 9 liters of water more.
Response:  Maíre needs to make 7 flour tortillas and she has already mixed 4 cups of dough with 10 eggs. To find out how many more eggs she needs, we can subtract the number of eggs she has used from the total number of eggs required:  7 - 4 = 3 eggs are needed. So, Maíre needs 3 more eggs to complete her task.
Response:  We know that Maíra has already added 10 flour spoons (φλιτζάνια) of zahar to the dough, which means she has used 1/3 of the total amount required (12 flour spoons). Therefore, we need to add another 6 flour spoons (φλιτζάνια) of alvi to complete the recipe. So, the final answer is 16 flour spoons (φλιτζάνια) of alvi needed to be added to the dough.
Response:  If there are currently 19 families of foxes living in the area and 60 more foxes from other areas move into the area due to heatwaves, then the total number of fox families in the area will be:  19 + (60 / 2) = 35 fox families.
Response:  If there are 87 families of foxes living in the area and 7 of them moved away due to heat, then the number of remaining families is 87 - 7 = 80. Since we know that each family has an average of 5 pups per litter, the total number of pups born to all families of foxes in the area is 80 x 5 = 400 pups.
Response:  At the beginning of winter (let's say November), there were 20 families of foxes living near the mountain. During the winter season, 14 families of foxes remained in their original location while 6 families migrated to warmer areas. So, at the start of winter, there were 6 families of foxes living near the mountain.
"Response:  If there are currently 85 families of foxes living near the mountain and 23 families migrate to Africa and 37 families migrate to Asia, then we have:

Number of families of foxes remaining in the mountain = 85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25 families

Therefore, 25 families of foxes remain near the mountain after some families migrated to other regions."
Response:  We know that there are 8 families of foxes living near the mountain. If 42 families of foxes migrated to Africa and 31 families migrated to Asia, how many more families of foxes migrated to Africa than to Asia? To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of families that migrated to Asia from the number of families that migrated to Africa. So, the answer is: 42 - 31 = 11 more families of foxes migrated to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain. If 47 of these families migrated to Africa and 94 families migrated to Asia, how many more bird families migrated to Asia than to Africa? To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of families that migrated to Africa from the number of families that migrated to Asia. So, the answer is: 94 - 47 = 47. Therefore, 47 more bird families migrated to Asia than to Africa.
"Response:  If there are currently 18 families of foxes living near the mountain and they move to Africa or Asia, then we have to calculate how many families will be left in Greece after this migration.  Since each family consists of 5-6 individuals (according to the given information), we can assume that the total number of individuals in each family is around 25-30. Therefore, if 38 families of foxes migrate to Africa, the total number of foxes that will leave Greece is:

$$ Number = \frac{38}{2} \times 25 = 70 $$

Similarly, if 80 families of foxes migrate to Asia, the total number of foxes that will leave Greece is:

$$ Number = \frac{80}{2} \times 25 = 120 $$

So, in total, around $Number = 70 + 120 = 190$ families of foxes will leave Greece due to climate change."
Response:  We know that there are currently 87 families of foxes living near a mountain range. If 18 new families of foxes were born and grew up in this area, how many families of foxes would be living near the mountain range now?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of existing families of foxes (87) by the number of years since the birth of the new families of fox (18). So, the answer is: 87 / 18 = 5 families of foxes.
Response:  We know that there are 49 families of foxes living near the mountain and 59 families have moved away due to heat. This means that 10 (49 - 59) families of foxes remained near the mountain.
Response:  If there were initially 27 families of foxes living near a mountain and they moved away due to heat, then the number of families that remained nearby would be equal to the initial number divided by the factor by which they moved away (in this case, 3). So, if there were initially 41 families of foxes living near the mountain, then 16 families (41 / 3 = 16) would remain nearby.
"Response:  If there were initially 86 families of foxes living in an area and they moved away due to heat, then we can assume that each family consisted of about 5-7 individuals (on average). So, the total number of foxes that moved away was approximately:

86 families x 5 individuals per family = 430 individuals

Now, let's consider the second part of the question. If there were initially 45 families of foxes living near the mountain, how many more families would move away due to the heat compared to those that remained? To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of foxes that moved away (from both areas) by the total number of foxes remaining near the mountain:

Total number of foxes moving away / Total number of foxes remaining = 430 / 45 = 9.5

So, approximately 9.5 times as many families of foxes would move away due to the heat if they had lived near the mountain initially."
Response:  We know that there are 41 bird families living near the mountain. If 35 of these families moved to Asia and 62 families moved to Africa, how many more bird families moved to Africa than to Asia? To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of families that moved to Asia from the number of families that moved to Africa. So, the answer is: 62 - 35 = 27 more bird families moved to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are three families of foxes living near the mountain and they have been living there for some time. Then, we learn that 26 new families of foxes came from the Arctic to live near the mountain. Finally, we find out that two families of foxes moved further south. So, the number of families of foxes remaining near the mountain is:  26 - 2 = 24
Response:  The boy had 253 molybium for his teeth and lost 70 of them until the end of elementary school. So, he had 183 molybium left at the end of elementary school.
Response:  The boy had 551 marbles at first and lost 374 of them until he was left with 177 marbles. So, the number of marbles he received for his birthday is:  551 - 374 = 177
Response:  The man had 440 molybdenum coins and gave 111 to his friends during his school years while he lost 106 molybdenum coins. So, the number of molybdenum coins that remained with him is:  440 - 111 = 329 molybdenum coins.
Response:  The boy had 65 molybiums at first and gave away 213 during his school years, which means he lost 16 molybiums. So, the final amount of molybiums he had was: 65 - 16 = 49 molybiums.
Response:  The man had 589 marbles at first and gave away 161 of them during his school years. So he has 428 marbles left. Now we are asked how many more marbles he gave away than he had initially. To find this difference, we subtract the number of marbles he gave away (161) from the initial number of marbles he had (589): 589 - 161 = 428 Therefore, he gave away 428 more marbles than he had initially.
Response:  The man had 110 molybiums at first and gave away 90 of them to his friends during his school years, which means he has 20 molybiums left (110 - 90 = 20). Then, he lost 412 molybiums, so he now has 632 molybiums less than what he initially had (412 - 20 = 632). Therefore, the man has 610 molybiums left (632 - 20 = 610).
Response:  The man had 563 molybiums during his school years and gave away 558 of them while he had 332 left over. So, he received 15 molybiums (563 - 558 = 15)
Response:  If he had only 492 molybiums, then he would have given away 108 molybiums (52 - 492 = 108). So, there would be 108 less molybiums left in his possession.
Response:  The total number of moles is given as 521 + 66 = 587 moles. Since they did not lose any molecules during their school years, the number of moles at the end of their schooling period is equal to the initial number of moles, which is 587 moles. Therefore, no moles were lost during this time.
Response:  We know that at first, Pol had 531 molybiums and 38 svines for his teeth. At the end of his school years, he only had 391 left, meaning he lost 140 molybiums (531 - 391 = 140). So, Pol had 140 molybiums left.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of high school (grade 9), Pol had 601 molybdenum and 406 svines for his genitalia. At the end of high school (grade 12), he only had 336 molybdenum left, while none of them were lost. So, how many more molybdenum did he have than svines? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of molybdenum he had at the end of high school from the total number of molybdenum he had at the beginning of high school: 601 - 336 = 265 molybdenum. Therefore, Pol had 265 more molybdenum than svines.
Response:  The boy had 291 remaining days of his school life until he turned 18 years old. If he lost or gave away 315 days, that means he had -44 days left (315-291= -44). So, he had -44 molybia for his genethlia.
Response:  The man had 267 molybdenum in his pocket when he went to school. During the time he spent at school (which we assume is equal to the duration of his schooling), he lost 231 molybdenum. Therefore, he gave away 308 - 231 = 77 more molybdenum to his friends than he lost during his schooling.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the school year, Pol had 457 teeth and 320 molars. At the end of the school year, they only had 523 teeth left, without losing any. So, we can calculate the number of molars lost as follows: Number of molars lost = Total number of molars at the beginning of the year - Total number of molars at the end of the year = 320 - 523 = -203 molars Therefore, Pol had lost 203 molars during the school year.
Response:  At first, there were 11 customers in total (including the server). When some of them left, he had 3 remaining customers. So, the number of customers who remained after those who left is 3 - 11 = -8. Therefore, more than half of the original customers left.
Response:  The server had 3 customers initially and then lost some of them. After that, he had 4 customers remaining. So, the number of customers who remained after some customers left is 4 - 3 = 1 more customer than the initial number of customers. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 (the total number of customers).
Response:  At first, he had 9 customers (since 9 customers left). Then, he still had 12 customers. So, in total, he had 9 + 12 = 21 customers at the beginning.
Response:  We know that there were initially 14 customers and 5 of them left. So, the number of remaining customers is 14 - 5 = 9. Now we are asked how many customers the server has left. Therefore, the answer is 9.
"Response:  At first, he had 13 customers. After some of them left, he gained 4 new customers. So, the number of customers he had after that is:

13 - (some left) + 4 = x

We don't know exactly how many customers left, so we can't solve for x yet. But we do know that the total number of customers he had after gaining 4 new ones is 9. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 9

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5

So, there were 5 customers who remained with him after some of his original customers left and he gained 4 new ones."
Response:  At first, the sergeant had 12 passengers (including himself). Then, 15 passengers left, leaving him with no passengers. Finally, he gained 14 new passengers, so he has __________ passengers now.  Solution: 14 + 12 = 26
Response:  At first, the server had 3 customers. When more customers arrived, he had 8 customers in total (including the original 3). So, 5 new customers came (8 - 3 = 5).
Response:  At first, the serbitor had 8 customers. After some of them left, he had 5 remaining customers. Then, he gained 99 new customers. So, the number of customers who remained unchanged is:  8 - 5 = 3. Therefore, 3 customers remained with him after the gain and loss of customers.
Response:  At first, he had 12 customers. Then, some of them left and he had 14 customers remaining. Later, he gained 10 new customers. So, now he has 24 customers in total (14 + 10).
Response:  At first, Dan had $300. Then he spent $20 on a chocolate bar. So, his new amount of money is $300 - $20 = $280.
Response: Δan had $4 and he bought a chocolate bar that cost $1. So, now he has $3 left ($4 - $1 = $3).
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 99 chocolates for $3 each. So, he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. Now, we need to find out how much money is left with Dan after buying the chocolates. Therefore, the amount of money left with Dan is $4 - $297 = $-293.
Response:  The total amount of money Dan has is $3. He bought two chocolates for $4 each, so he spent a total of $8. Therefore, the cost of each chocolate is $8 / 2 = $4.
Response:  We know that Dan has $20 and he bought some chocolates for $6 each. So, in total, he spent $6 x  number of chocolates = $6x. Since he had $20 initially, we can say that $6x < $20, which means that $x < 4 (since $6 is greater than $2). Therefore, Dan bought 4 chocolates.
Response:  The total amount of money Dan has is $7. He spent $2 for one chocolate and $3 for another chocolate. So, he had $7 - $2 - $3 = $2 left after buying both chocolates.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan has is $4 + $6 = $10. He bought one chocolate for $7 and another for $6, so he spent a total of $7 + $6 = $13. Therefore, Dan needs $10 - $13 = -$3 to buy both chocolates.
Response:  Dan has $20 and buys two chocolates for $6 each and one for $3 each. To find out how much he spent in total, we can add up the prices of all the chocolates he bought: $6 + $6 + $3 = $15 So, Dan spent $15 to buy three chocolates.
Response:  Dan has $5 and he bought two chocolates for $2 each, so he spent $4 in total. Now he has $1 left. To buy another chocolate that costs $3, he will need to spend an additional $3, so the total amount he will spend is $6 ($4 + $3).
Response:  At first, Dan had $4. Then he bought a chocolate bar for $8. So now he has $4 - $8 =-$4 left. After that, his friend gave him $5. Now Dan has $4 + $5 = $9. Therefore, the amount of money Dan had left was $9.
Response:  At first, Dan had $3. Then he spent $1 on a chocolate bar. So now he has $2 left. If he had $4 at the beginning, then he spent $1 = $0.50 (since $1 is half of $2). Therefore, the cost of the chocolate bar was $0.50.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 10 chocolates with each one costing the same amount of money. So, he spent a total of $4 x 10 = $40. Therefore, there are $40 left over after buying the chocolates.
"Response:  The total amount of money Dan has is $3. He spent $4 to buy two chocolates, each one costing the same amount. So, the cost of each chocolate is:
Cost of each chocolate = Total amount of money / Number of chocolates
= $4 / 2
= $2 per chocolate"
Response:  Dan has $5 and he bought a chocolate bar for $3 and a candy bar for $7. To find out how much money Dan has left after buying these two items, we need to subtract their prices from his initial amount of money. So, the total cost of the two items is: $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, Dan has $5 - $10 = -$5 left after buying them.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys one chocolate bar for $7 and another one for $2. So he spent a total of $9. To buy a chocolate bar from him, you would need to pay him $9.
Response:  We know that Pol had 115 books and sold 78 of them in one garage sale. So, he has 37 remaining books (115 - 78 = 37).
Response:  At first, Pol had some books (we don't know how many). Then he sold 137 of them in one sale. After that, he was left with 105 books. So, initially, Pol had __________ books.
Response:  At first, Pol had 108 books and sold some to a garage sale, leaving him with 73 books. Then he gave 35 books to his friend, who already had 62 books, so now Pol has 38 books left (73 - 35 = 38). Therefore, Pol sold 41 books at the garage sale (108 - 73 = 35, which is the number of books he gave away + the number of books he sold).
"Response:  The bookshelf had 50 books initially. After selling some of them at a garage sale, there were 151 books left. So, the number of books he bought is:

Number of books = Total number of books after garage sale - Initial number of books
= 151 - 50
= 101

Therefore, he bought 101 books."
Response:  At first, Pol had two books. After he sold some of them in a garage sale and bought 150 new books, he now has 58 books left. So, Pol sold 92 books (2 - 58 = 92).
Response:  At first, Pete had 21 books and sold some of them to raise $42. Since he now has 15 books left, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the initial amount to find out how many more books he had initially. So, the answer is: 21 - 42 = -$21.
Response:  At first, Pete had 71 books and sold some of them in a garage sale, gaining $38. So he has fewer books now than he did initially. To find out how many fewer, we can subtract the amount he gained from the initial number of books: 71 - $38 = 33. Therefore, Pete gained 33 more books than he sold at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, Pete had 108 books and 55 molibiia. After he sold some of them in a garage sale, they left with 66 books and 59 molibiia. So, Pete sold 42 books (108 - 66) and 3 molibiia (55 - 59).
Response:  At first, Pete had 51 books and 106 molybians. After he sold some books and gave them away, he had 82 books left. So, if he gave away 14 stylos (which is equal to 14 x 10 = 140), then he had initially 51 + 106 - 14 = 71 books left. Therefore, he gave away 14 stylos.
Response:  If he sold some books in an explosion and had 27 books left, then he must have started with at least 136 books (since 27 is less than half of 136). So, he sold 109 books (136 - 27 = 109).
Response:  At first, Pete had 134 books. Then he gave 39 books to his friend and sold some at a garage sale. After that, he had 68 books left. So, he sold __________ books at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, Pete had 95 pens and 153 books. After selling some books and giving some away, he had 13 books and 23 stylo left. So, he sold x books in the garage sale. Since he had 13 books left after the sale, we can say that x = 13. Therefore, Pete sold 13 books at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, Pete had 42 molybiums and 143 books. After he sold some books and gave them away, he was left with 113 books and 19 stylo. So, Pete sold 26 stylo (19 - 7 = 26).
Response:  At first, there were 10 trees in the garden. Then, Jessica cut 8 of them and threw them into the bushes. So, how many trees are left in the garden now? We can use subtraction to find out. Therefore, there are 2 trees left in the garden (10 - 8 = 2).
Response:  At first, there were 7 triantaphylla in the base. Then, Jésika picked 16 more from the garden and threw them into the basket. Now, there are 23 triantaphylla in the basket. So, initially, there were 7 + 16 = 23 triantaphylla in the basket.
Response:  Initially, there were two triangles in the basket. Then, Jésika picked four triangles from the basket and threw them into the garden. Now, there are 23 triangles in the basket. So, we can conclude that Jésika threw 21 triangles (23 - 2 = 21) into the garden.
Response:  At first, there were 15 trees in the garden. Then, Jésika cut 33 trees from the garden and threw some of them into the pond. Now, there are 17 trees left in the garden. So, how many more trees did Jésika cut than what was initially present?  Answer: 18 (33 - 15 = 18)
Response:  At first, there were 21 trees in the garden. Then, Jésika cut down 34 trees from the garden and threw some of them into the bushes. Now, there are 15 trees left in the garden. So, the number of trees that Jésika cut down is:  34 - 15 = 19
Response:  At first, there were 7 trees in the garden. Then, Jessica cut some more trees from the garden, which had a total of 59 trees. Now, there are 20 trees left in the garden. So, she cut 39 trees.
Response:  At first, there were 13 trees in the garden. Then, Jessica cut some of them from the garden, which had a total of 12 trees. Now, there are 21 trees in the garden. So, the number of trees that remained in the garden is:  21 - 12 = 9
Response:  At first, there were 15 triantaphylla and 62 orchids in the garden. Then, Jésika cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 17 triantaphylla and 96 orchids in the garden. So, Jésika cut 3 more triantaphylla and 30 more orchids than she found initially.
Response:  At first, there were 12 triantaphylla and 2 orchids in the base. Then, Jésika cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 10 triantaphylla and 21 orchids in the base. So, Jésika cut 2 orchids.
Response:  At first, there were 5 triantaphylla and 3 orchids in the garden. Then, Jessica cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 12 triantaphylla and 2 orchids in the garden. So, the number of triantaphylla that are more than the number of orchids in the garden now is:  12 - 2 = 10
Response:  At first, there were 7 triantaphylla and 12 orchids in the garden. Then, Jésika cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 11 triantaphylla and 20 orchids in the garden. So, there are 9 orchids in the garden now.
Response:  At first, there were 20 triangles in the garden. Then, Jessica picked some of them and put them into her basket. Now, there are 19 triangles left in the garden. So, if there were 3 triangles initially, then the number of triangles that Jessica picked is: Number of triangles Jessica picked = Initial number of triangles - Number of triangles left after Jessica's pick = 3 
Response:  At first, there were 13 triantaphylla and 84 orchids in the garden. Then, Jésika cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 91 orchids and 14 triantaphylla in the garden. So, Jésika cut 4 triantaphylla.
Response:  At first, there were 16 triantaphylla and 3 orchids in the base. Then, Jésika cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 7 orchids and 13 triantaphylla in the base. So, Jésika cut 9 orchids (7 - 3 = 9).
Response:  At first, there were 6 triantaphylla and 20 orchids in the garden. Then, Jessica cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 21 orchids and 22 triantaphylla in the garden. So, there are 5 more triantaphylla than orchids in the garden now.
Response:  At first, there were 9 triantaphylla and 6 orchids in the garden. Then, Jésika cut some more triantaphylla and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 13 orchids and 3 triantaphylla in the garden. So, there are 10 orchids in the garden now.
Response:  The distance of Robin's legs was initially 17 inches long and then reduced by some number of inches. If now his legs are 30 inches long, how many inches did they reduce? So, the answer is 13 inches (30 - 17 = 13).
Response:  If Rombin had 20 inches of hair before she cut it and now has 10 inches, then we can calculate how much she lost as follows:  Loss = New length - Original length = 10 - 20 = -10 inches So, Rombin lost 10 inches of hair.
Response:  At first, Robin had 16 inches long hair. After cutting it, he got 35 inches long again. Now, he has cut it again and it is 12 inches long. So, at present, Robin's hair length is:  12 + 16 = 28 inches
Response:  If Róbin's legs were originally 19 inches long and he grew another 18 inches taller, how much longer are his legs now? So, if his legs were initially 19 inches long, and then they got 18 inches longer, that means his new length is: 19 + 18 = 37 inches. Therefore, Róbin's legs are currently 37 inches long.
Response:  If Rome has walked 30 kilometers away from her starting point and initially had 14 inches in height, then now she is X meters tall where X = 30 / 14 = 2.14 meters taller than her initial height.
Response:  At first, Robin had 14 inches long hair. Then he cut it and reduced its length to 8 inches. After that, he grew his hair back and it became 20 inches long. So, currently Robin's hair is 20 - 8 = 12 inches long.
Response:  We know that Δανία has 12 bags of apples in his collection and he found 53 bags of apples in the park. So, we can calculate the total number of bags of apples Dania has now as follows: Total number of bags = Number of bags in collection + Number of bags found in the parkTotal number of bags = 12 + 53 = 65So, Dania has 65 bags of apples now.
Response:  We know that Dan has 21 bicycles in his collection and he found some more in the parking lot. So, let's assume he found x more bicycles. Now we have: Total number of bicycles = 21 + x. Since we want to find out how many bicycles Dan found in the parking lot, we can set up the equation: Number of bicycles found in the parking lot = Total number of bicycles - Number of bicycles in Dan's collection. Substituting the values we know, we get: Number of bicycles found in the parking lot = 53 - 21 = 32. Therefore, Dan found 32 bicycles in the parking lot.
Response:  At first, Dan had 63 balloons in his collection and then he gave away 51 old balloons to someone else. So, he has 33 balloons left in his collection now. Therefore, the number of balloons that Dan had at the beginning is 63 - 51 = 12.
Response:  At first, Dan had 36 bouquets of flowers in his garden and he gave away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 bouquets left in his collection. To find out how many more bouquets Dan found in the park than he gave away, we need to subtract the number of bouquets he gave away from the total number of bouquets he had at first: 36 - 35 = 1 So, Dan found 1 more bouquet in the park than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Νδάνι collected 30 old shoes from the park and then he found 63 more old shoes in the park. So, the total number of old shoes he found is 93 (30 + 63). Now, we are asked how many more old shoes Νδάνι collected than the ones he found in the park. To find this difference, we subtract the number of old shoes he found from the total number of old shoes he collected: 107 - 93 = 14. Therefore, Νδάνι collected 14 more old shoes than the ones he found in the park.
Response:  At first, Ντάνι had 22 kittens and 8 puppies in his yard. Then he found 20 more kittens and 15 more puppies. So, at the end, he had 28 kittens and 63 puppies in total. Therefore, Νδάνι started with 22 kittens.
Response:  At first, Δανία had 22 kittens and 30 puppies in her collection. Then she found 17 more kittens and 57 more puppies in the park. So, at the end, Δανία had 49 kittens (22 + 17) and 97 puppies (30 + 57).
Response:  At first, Δάνι had 30 caps and 14 tyres in his park. Then he found 7 more caps and 86 more tyres. So, initially, he had 30 + 7 = 37 caps and 14 + 86 = 100 tyres. Therefore, he found 63 more caps than tyres (37 - 100 = -63).
Response:  At first, Δάνι had 11 kittens and 28 puppies in his park. Then he found 6 more kittens and 34 more puppies. So, at the end, he had 68 kittens and 51 puppies in total. Therefore, the number of puppies that Δάνι found exceeded the number of kittens by 33 (51 - 11 = 33).
Response:  At first, Δανία had 71 kites and 24 balloons in her collection. Then she found 28 more kites and 16 more balloons. So, now she has 28 + 28 = 56 kites and 16 + 16 = 32 balloons in total. Therefore, Δανία has 56 kites and 32 balloons currently.
Response:  At first, Δανία had 10 capuchins and 62 monkeys in the park. Then, she found 27 more capuchins and 43 more monkeys in the park. So, now Δανία has 27 + 10 = 37 capuchins and 43 + 62 = 105 monkeys in her collection. Therefore, Δανία currently has 37 monkeys and 105 monkeys in total.
Response:  At first, Δανία had 66 bags of apples in the park. Now she has 25 bags left in her collection. So, initially, Δανία had 41 bags (66 - 25 = 41) of apples.
Response:  If Dan has found some toys in his backyard and he already has 32 toys in his collection, then he must have found at least 25 more toys in the backyard. So, the total number of toys that Dan has found is 32 + 25 = 57 toys.
Response:  At first, Ντάνι had 60 old books in his collection. Then he found 58 more used books at the park and added them to his collection, so now he has 67 books in total. Therefore, Νδάνι had 6 + 58 = 64 books at the beginning.
Response:  At first, Dan had 6 old books in his collection and found 50 new ones in the park. So, he now has 60 books in total (6 + 50 = 66). Since he already had 6 old books, he now has 66 - 6 = 60 new books in his collection. Therefore, Dan found 60 more new books than he already had in his collection.
Response:  If Νδάνι had 54 old books in his collection before he found 48 more new ones, then he now has 52 + 48 = 100 books in his collection. So, Νδάνι added 48 more books to his collection than he already had.
Response:  At first, Δανία had 82 pebbles and 29 marbles in her collection. Then she found 42 more pebbles and 61 more marbles to add to her collection. So, at the end, Δανία had 82 + 42 = 124 pebbles and 29 + 61 = 80 marbles in her collection.
Response:  At first, Δανία had 66 puzzles and 39 bouquets in her collection. Then she found 16 more puzzles and 68 more bouquets to add to her collection. So, at the end, Δανία had 66 + 16 = 82 puzzles and 39 + 68 = 107 bouquets in her collection.
Response:  At first, Δάνι had 46 puzzles and 50 bouquets in his park. Then he found 21 more puzzles and 52 more bouquets. So, the total number of puzzles he found is 46 + 21 = 67. Similarly, the total number of bouquets he found is 50 + 52 = 102. Therefore, Δάνι found 67 more puzzles and 102 more bouquets than he initially had in his park.
Response:  We know that Δανί has found 65 pebbles and 5 bouquets of flowers in the park. Now he has 31 caps and 9 pebbles left in his collection. To find out how many more pebbles than bouquets Daní found in the park, we need to subtract the number of bouquets from the total number of items he had at first:  Number of pebbles = Total number of items - Number of bouquets = 65 - 5 = 60 So, Δανί found 60 more pebbles than bouquets in the park.
Response:  At first, Δάνι had 58 kittens and 25 puppies in his park. Now he has 11 puppies and 12 kittens. So, he lost 47 kittens (58 - 12) and gained 9 puppies (25 + 11). Therefore, Δάνι currently has 47 kittens and 9 puppies in his park.
Response:  We know that Δανί has collected 15 caps and 18 toys in his park. Now he has 67 toy cars and 35 buckets in his collection. So, we can calculate the number of toys Daní has now as follows: Number of toys = Total number of toys collected - Number of toys already in his collection Total number of toys collected = 15 + 18 = 33 Toys already in his collection = 67 (from the previous question) Therefore, Δανί has 33 - 67 = -34 toys now.
Response:  We know that Tjeik has 11 fewer roses than Stephen. So if Tjeik has 17 roses, then Stephen must have 28 roses (17 - 11 = 28).
Response:  We know that Σtívan has more red cars than Jéik. Specifically, Σtívan has 14 more red cars than Jéik. So if Jéik has x red cars, then Σtívan has x + 14 red cars. Therefore, the number of red cars that Jéik has is equal to 14 less than the number of red cars that Σtívan has. In other words, Jéik has 14 fewer red cars than Σtívan. So, Jéik has 7 red cars.
Response:  We know that Tjeik has fewer red cars than Stephen (18 - 13 = 5). So, Tjeik has 5 more red cars than Jil (0). Therefore, Jil has 19 - 5 = 14 red cars.
Response:  We know that Tjeik has fewer red cars than Stephen. Specifically, Tjeik has 3 fewer red cars than Stephen. So, if Stephen has 8 more red cars than Jil, then Tjeik has 8 - (3-1) = 6 more red cars than Jil. Therefore, Tjeik has 6 more red cars than Jil.
Response:  We know that Tjeik has 12 fewer roses than Stephen, who has 11 more roses than Jil. So, if we subtract 12 from 11, we get 9. Therefore, Jil has 9 more roses than Tjeik.
Response:  We know that Τζέικ has fewer red cars than Stephen and more red cars than Jill. Specifically, he has 7 fewer red cars than Stephen and 9 more red cars than Jill. So, if Stephen has 16 red cars, then Tjeik must have 9 + 7 = 16 red cars as well. Therefore, Tjeik has 16 red cars.
"Response:  We know that Tjeik has 7 fewer red cars than Stephen and 8 more than Jil. So, if Stephen has x red cars, then Tjeik has x - 7 red cars. Similarly, if Jil has y red cars, then Tjeik has y + 8 red cars. Now we are given that Stephen has 17 red cars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x = 17 - 7 = 10
So, Tjeik has 10 red cars."
"Response:  We know that Tjeik has 9 fewer red cars than Stephen and 18 more than Jil. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:
Tjeik - 9 = Stephen + 18
Now, we are told that Stephen has 16 red cars. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation above to get:
Tjeik - 9 = 16 + 18
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Tjeik = 24
So, Stephen has 24 red cars more than Jil."
"Response:  We know that 
* The Jeep has 6 fewer rodakins than Stephen. So, if Stephen has x rodakins, the Jeep has x - 6 rodakins.
* The Stephen has 18 more pirsikia than the Tzili. So, if the Tzili has y pirsikia, the Stephen has y + 18 pirsikia.
From the information given in the question, we can write two equations:
x - 6 = y + 18...(1)
x = y + 6...(2)
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 9
So, the Jeep has 9 rodakins."
"Response:  The given information is as follows:

* Τζέικ (Jek) has 5 fewer red apples than Stephen.
* Stephen has 18 more pears than Jek.
* Jek has 87 red apples in total.

Now we need to find out how many more red apples Jek has than Stephen. We can do this by subtracting the number of red apples that Jek has from the number of red apples that Stephen has:

Number of red apples that Jek has = 87 - 5 = 82

So, Jek has 82 more red apples than Stephen."
"Response:  The given information is as follows:

* Τζέικ (Jek) has 16 less rodakins than Stiven.
* Stiven has 15 more pirsikia than Jek.
* Tzil has 12 more rodakins than Jek.

So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Jek's rodakins = Stven's rodakins - 16
Stven's pirsikia = Jek's pirsikia + 15
Tzl's rodakins = Jek's rodakins + 12

Now, let's solve for the number of rodakins that Tzl has more than Jek:

Tzl's rodakins = Jek's rodakins + 12
Tzl's rodakins = 16 + 12
Tzl's rodakins = 28

Therefore, Tzl has 28 more rodakins than Jek."
Response:  We know that Tjeik has fewer apples than Stephen. So, if Tjeik has x apples, then Stephen has x + 14 apples. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Tjeik's apples = x (since he has fewer) and Stephen's apples = x + 14 ( since he has more). Now, we are given that Tjeik has 12 less red berries than Stephen. This means that for every red berry that Stephen has, Tjeik has one less. So, we can write another equation as follows: Red berries of Tjeik = (Stephen's red berries - 12) / 3 (since there are three times as many red berries as apples). Finally, we add these two equations together to get our final answer: Apples of Tjeik = 16 (x) Red berries of Tjeik = (19 - 12) / 3 = 6
"Response:  We know that Tjeik has more apples than Stephen. So, if Tjeik has x apples and Stephen has y apples, we can write an equation as follows: 
Tjeik’s total number of apples = x
Stephen’s total number of apples = y
Now, we are given that Tjeik has 13 fewer apples than Stephen. This means that Tjeik’s total number of apples is equal to Stephen’s total number of apples minus 13: 
Tjeik’s total number of apples = Stephen’s total number of apples - 13
Substituting the values given in the question, we get: 
x - 13 = y + 8
Solving for x (the number of apples Tjeik has), we get: 
x = y + 5
So, Tjeik has 5 more apples than Stephen. Therefore, the answer is: 5"
Response:  We know that Tjeik has fewer apples than Stephen. Specifically, Tjeik has 6 less apples than Stephen. So, if Stephen has x apples, then Tjeik has x - 6 apples. Now we are told that Stephen has 17 apples more than Tjeik. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples that Stephen and Tjeik have is equal to 17. So, we can write an equation as follows: x - (x - 6) = 17. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x - 6 = 17. Solving for x, we find that Stephen has 34 apples.
Response:  We know that Τζέικ has fewer apples than Stephen. Specifically, Tjeik has 3 less apples than Stephen. So, if Stephen has x apples, Tjeik has x - 3 apples. Now we are told that Stephen has 12 more apples than Tjeik. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples that Stephen and Tjeik have is 12. So, the number of apples that Stephen has is x + 12.
Response:  We know that Stiven has 12 red apples and Jek has 4 fewer red apples than Stiven. So, if Stiven has x red apples, then Jek has x - 4 red apples. Since Stiven has 67 more red apples than Zee, we can write an equation: x + (x - 4) = 67. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 63. Therefore, Jek has 32 red apples.
Response:  We know that Stiven has 18 red apples and Jek has 12 fewer red apples than Stiven. So, if Stiven has x red apples, then Jek has x - 12 red apples. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  X = 18 (since Stiven has 18 red apples) Jek has x - 12 red apples, so the number of red apples Jek has is equal to 18 minus the number of red apples he has minus 12. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  X = 18 - 12 = 6 ( since Jek has 6 red apples). Therefore, Jek has 6 red apples.
Response:  We know that Stiven has 19 red apples and Jek has 12 fewer red apples than Stiven. So, Jek has 19 - 12 = 7 red apples less than Stiven. Therefore, Jek has 19 + 7 = 26 red apples in total.
Response:  We know that Stiven has 14 red apples and Jek has 6 fewer red apples than Stiven. So, Jek has 14 - 6 = 8 red apples. Now, we are told that Jek has 3 more red apples than Zil. Therefore, Zil has 8 + 3 = 11 red apples.
Response:  We know that Tjeik has more apples than Stephen. So, if Tjeik had x apples and Stephen had y apples, we can write an equation based on this information:  Tjeik has 84 apples, so he must have at least 84 - y apples. Since Stephen has 13 apples less than Tjeik, we can say that Tjeik has 84 - 13 = 71 apples more than Stephen. Therefore, the number of apples Tjeik has is 71.
"Response:  We know that Tjeik has more apples than Stephen. So, if Tjeik has x apples and Stephen has y apples, we can write an equation as follows: 
Tjeik has 13 more apples than Stephen, so we can add 13 to both sides of the equation: 
Now we have: 
So, Tjeik has 15 apples (x + 13). Now let's find out how many oranges Stephen has. We know that Stephen has 17 fewer oranges than Tjeik. So, if Tjeik has x oranges and Stephen has y oranges, we can write an equation as follows: 
Stephen has 17 fewer oranges than Tjeik, so we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation: 
Now we have: 
So, Stephen has 9 oranges (y - 17). Therefore, Tjeik has 15 apples and Stephen has 9 oranges."
Response:  We know that Tjeik has fewer apples than Stephen. Specifically, Tjeik has 8 less apples than Stephen. So, if Stephen has x apples, then Tjeik has x - 8 apples. Now we are told that Stephen has 11 more apples than Tjeik. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples that Stephen and Tjeik have is equal to 11. So, the number of apples that Stephen has is x + 11. Similarly, since Tjeik has fewer red currants than Stephen, we can conclude that Tjeik has x - 8 red currants, and Stephen has x + 18 red currants. Therefore, the total number of red currants that Stephen has is 18 + (x - 8).
"Response:  We know that Tjeik has fewer apples than Stephen. So, if Tjeik has x apples, then Stephen has x + 15 apples. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x = (Stephen's number of apples) - (Tjeik's number of apples).
We are given that Tjeik has 3 less apples than Stephen, so we can substitute this value in the above equation:
x = (Stephen's number of apples) - (Tjeik's number of apples) = (19) - (x - 3)
Now, we have to solve for 'x', which means finding out how many apples Stephen has. To do this, we need to isolate the variable 'x'. In this case, we can divide both sides of the equation by (-3):
x = (19) - (x - 3) / (-3) = 16
So, Stephen has 16 apples."
Response:  At first, there were $78 in Olivia's purse. Then, she spent $15 on supermarket items. So, how much money has remained? We can calculate it as follows: $78 - $15 = $63. Therefore, there are $63 left in Olivia's purse.
"Response:  If Olívia spent $78 on supermarket and she had $33 initially, then we can calculate her initial amount of money as follows:

Initial amount = $33 + $78 = $111

So, Olívia had $111 in total at first."
Response:  At first, there were $100 in Olivia's purse. Then she withdrew another $148 from an ATM. After that, she had $159 left. So, she gained $49 ($148 - $100).
Response:  At first, there were $3 dollars in the portfolio of Olivia. Then, she withdrew $49 from an ATM. After that, she went to a supermarket and spent $49. So, how much money did she have left in her account after spending $49 at the supermarket? Well, if she had $49 before going to the supermarket, then she must have had $0 afterward, since she spent all of it. Therefore, the correct answer is $0.
Response:  At first, there were $53 in Olivia's purse. Then, she received $91 from an ATM. After that, she spent $14 at a supermarket. So, how much money did she have left? $$ = \text { initial amount} - \text{amount received from ATM} + \text{amount spent }$$ In this case, the initial amount was $53, she received $91 from the ATM, and she spent $14 at the supermarket. Therefore, the final amount of money Olivia had was: $$= 53 - 91 + 14 = 28$$ So, Olivia had $28 left after spending $14 at the supermarket.
Response:  At first, there were $106 in the portfolio of Olivia. After visiting a supermarket and an exhibition space, she had $26 left. If she spent $49 on the exhibition space, how much did she spend on the supermarket?
Response:  At first, Oliva had $29 in her supermarket bag, and then she received an additional $54. So, the total amount of money Oliva had at the beginning was $29 + $54 = $83.
Response:  Initially, there were $128 in cash at the supermarket. If Oliva spent $38 on something, then the amount of money left at the checkout is: $128 - $38 = $90. So, $90 remained at the checkout.
Response:  We know that David had 19 applications for his car. He accepted 5 of them. So, we need to find out how many applications he rejected. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of Rejected Applications = Total number of applications - Number of Accepted Applications In this case, the total number of applications is 19 (as given in the question), and the number of accepted applications is 5 (also as given in the question). Therefore, the number of rejected applications is: Number of Rejected Applications = 19 - 5 = 14 So, David rejected 14 applications for his car.
Response: Δevin had 18 applications for his car. After he sold 18 of them, he was left with 5. So, in total, Devin had 5 applications for his car at the beginning.
Response:  At first, David had 10 applications on his phone. Then he added 11 new ones. After deleting some of them, he was left with 4 apps. So, he deleted 7 applications.
Response:  At first, David had 21 applications in his car. After he deleted some of them, there were 24 remaining. So, how many more applications did he add compared to those he deleted? $ = \text {number of new apps added} - \text{ number of apps deleted}$ $= 89 - 24$ $= 65$ Therefore, David added 65 more applications than he deleted.
Response:  At first, David had 15 applications in his mobile phone. Then he added 71 new applications, so the total number of applications became 86 (15 + 71). After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. Therefore, the difference between the number of applications he had after adding and the number he had initially is 71 - 15 = 56.
Response:  At first, David had 16 applications and 77 directories in his phone. After he deleted some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 directories. So, he deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 50 directories (77 - 23 = 50).
Response:  At first, David had 17 applications and 21 departments in his phone. After he left some of them, there were 3 applications and 7 departments remaining. So, the number of departments that remained is 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, David removed 14 departments from his phone.
Response:  At first, David had 15 applications and 24 archives in his phone. After some of them were deleted, he was left with 21 applications and 4 archives. So, how many more applications than archives did he have? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of archives from the total number of applications: 21 - 4 = 17. Therefore, David had 17 more applications than archives after deleting some of them.
Response:  At first, David had 19 applications and 18 departments in his phone. After he deleted some of them, 6 applications and 15 departments remained. So, the number of other applications that he has left is 13 (19 - 6 = 13).
Response:  At first, David had 17 applications on his phone. After adding one more application, he now has 18 applications. So, there is an increase of 1 application.
Response:  At first, David had 59 archives and 15 applications in his phone. After he deleted some of them, he was left with 12 applications and 30 archives. So, he deleted 47 applications (15 - 12 = 47).
Response:  At first, David had 24 archives and 13 applications in his phone. After he deleted some of them, he was left with 17 applications and 21 archives. So, he deleted 7 archives (21 - 17 = 7).
Response:  At first, David had 24 applications and 9 branches in his phone. After some of them were deleted, he was left with 5 branches and 12 applications. So, how many more applications than branches has he deleted? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of branches from the total number of applications. Therefore, the answer is: 12 - 5 = 7 more applications than branches have been deleted by David.
Response:  At first, David had 11 applications and 3 departments in his phone. After he deleted some of them, there were 24 departments left. Now we need to find out how many applications are left after deleting those departments. We know that each department can have multiple applications associated with it, so let's assume that each department has an average of 5 applications associated with it (this is just an estimate). Therefore, the total number of applications associated with the 24 departments is: 24 x 5 = 120 applications. So, after deleting the departments, David has 11 - 24 = -13 applications remaining in his phone.
Response:  We know that Nel has 242 cards and he gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate how many cards Nel has left as follows: Number of cards left = Total number of cards - Number of cards given away = 242 - 136 = 106 cards. Therefore, Nel has 106 cards left.
Response:  At first, Nel had 301 cards from Jeff. Now he has 154 cards left. So, initially, Nel had 301 - 154 = 147 cards.
Response:  Initially, Nel had 528 cards and Jeff had 11 cards.  When Nel gave some of his cards to Jeff, he had 252 cards left. So, the number of cards that Nel gave to Jeff is:  Number of cards given by Nel to Jeff = Total number of cards left by Nel - Number of cards Jeff already had = 252 - 11 = 241 cards.
Response:  Initially, Nel had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now, we know that Jeff has 234 cards more than he initially had (since he received some of Nel's cards). So, Jeff now has 535 cards in total. Therefore, Jeff has 191 cards (535 - 234 = 191) more cards than he initially had.
Response:  If Νελ had 309 cards of each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), then he gave some of them to Jeff. So, let's say he gave away x cards of hearts, y cards of diamonds, z cards of clubs, and w cards of spades. Since he has 415 cards left after giving some away, we can write the equation: 309 + y + z + w = 415. Now we need to solve for x, y, z, and w using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the above equation, we get: x = 72, y = 18, z = 27, and w = 10. Therefore, Νελ has 72 cards of hearts, 18 cards of diamonds, 27 cards of clubs, and 10 cards of spades left.
Response:  If Νελ had 246 mb cards and gave some to Jeff, then he has fewer than that now. So let's say he has x cards left. Since he also gave some 10 cards to Jeff, he has y 10 cards left. We know that the total number of cards he has is 404 (mb) + 495 (10), so we can set up the equation: x + y = 404 + 495. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 358 and y = 47. Therefore, Νελ has 358 mb cards and 47 10 cards left.
Response:  We know that Nel has 573 cards initially and he gives 195 cards to John. So, the number of cards left with Nel is: 573 - 195 = 378. Now, we are told that Nel gave some cards to Jeff too. But the information doesn't tell us how many cards he gave to Jeff. So, we can assume that the number of cards given to Jeff is less than or equal to the total number of cards left with Nel (378). Therefore, the number of cards given by Nel to Jeff is: 378 - x, where x is a positive integer less than or equal to 378. Solving for x, we get: x = 146. So, Nel gave 146 cards to Jeff.
Response:  If Νελ had 438 cards of suit A and 18 cards of suit B, then he gave some number of cards to Jeff. So, Νελ has fewer cards now than he had initially. Let's call this difference x. Since Νελ gave some cards to Jeff, he must have received an equal number of cards from Jeff. Therefore, the total number of cards that Νελ has now is x + (x/2), since he got half of the cards he gave to Jeff back. Now, we know that Νελ has 55 10-card sets and 178 mibezzbol cards, so we can write: x + (x/2) = 55 + 178. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 233. Solving for x, we find that Νελ has 116 cards left after giving some to Jeff.
Response:  If Νελ had 239 cards of each suit and gave some to Jeff, then he has fewer cards now. So, let's say he has x cards left. Since he also received y cards from Jeff, his total number of cards is x + y. Now, we know that he has 376 10-card sets and 111 bridge packs, so the sum of all his cards is: x + y = 376 + 111 = 487. Therefore, Νελ has 487 cards in total.
Response:  If Pako ate 19 biscuits and there were originally 35 biscuits, then we can calculate the number of biscuits that Pako had at the beginning as follows: Number of biscuits Pako had at the beginning = Total number of biscuits - Number of biscuits eaten by Pako = 35 - 19 = 16 Therefore, Pako had 16 biscuits at the beginning.
"Response:  We know that Pako ate 28 biscuits in total and after eating some of them, he had 7 left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: 28 - x = 7 Where ""x"" is the number of biscuits Pako ate before having 7 left. Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we can use subtraction: 28 - x = 7 Subtracting 28 from both sides gives us: x = 21 Therefore, Pako ate 21 biscuits before having 7 left."
Response:  The Pac-Man ate 40 pellets and then he ate two more. So, after eating those two additional pellets, he had 38 pellets left. Then, he ate another 37 pellets. Therefore, at the end, Pac-Man had 38 - 2 = 36 pellets left.
Response:  The pastry chef ate 25 biscuits and then bought 5 more. So, he had a total of 30 biscuits. Now, we need to find out how many additional biscuits he ate beyond what he bought. To do this, we subtract the number of biscuits he bought (5) from the total number of biscuits he had (30): 30 - 5 = 25 Therefore, the pastry chef ate an additional 25 biscuits beyond what he bought.
Response:  The pastry chef ate 13 biscuits and then bought more. Specifically, he bought 36 more biscuits. So, in total, the pastry chef ate 13 + 36 = 49 biscuits.
Response:  We know that Pako ate 40 biscuits in total and gave 13 to his friend. So, we can write an equation as follows: 40 = x + 13 where x is the number of biscuits Pako had left after giving some to his friend. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 13 from both sides of the equation: 40 - 13 = x Substituting the value of x into the equation above gives us: 27 = x Therefore, Pako had 27 biscuits left after giving some to his friend.
Response:  The pastry chef ate 17 biscuits and gave 13 of them to his friend. So, he had 4 more biscuits than he gave away (17 - 13 = 4). Therefore, the pastry chef ate 4 more biscuits than he gave away.
Response:  The pastry chef ate 12 biscuits and gave 21 to his friend. So, he had 9 (12 - 21) more biscuits than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Ο Πάκο had 22 biscuits and 75 almonds initially.  He ate 15 biscuits and 54 almonds. So, we can calculate how many biscuits he had left: Number of biscuits left = Initial number of biscuits - Number of biscuits eaten = 22 - 15 = 7 biscuits. Therefore, Ο Πάκο had 7 biscuits left.
Response:  We know that Pako had 9 baskets of sweets and 6 almonds. He ate 36 baskets of sweets and 3 almonds. So, we can write an equation: 9 + 6 = 36 + 3 To solve for the number of baskets of sweets Pako had after eating them, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 9 + 6 = 30  So, Pako had 30 baskets of sweets after eating them.
Response:  The pako had 37 sweet biscuits and 11 almonds. He ate 5 sweet biscuits and 2 almonds. So, he ate a total of 5 + 2 = 7 sweet biscuits and 2 almonds.
Response:  The pastry chef had 8 baskets of sweets and 6 almonds. He ate 20 sweet baskets and 34 almonds. How many more almonds did he eat than sweets? To find out, we need to subtract the number of almonds eaten from the total number of sweets eaten: Number of almonds eaten = 34 - (20 x 8) = 34 - 160 = -126 almonds So, the pastry chef ate fewer almonds than sweets.
Response:  If Pako had 36 biscuits at the beginning and he ate 3 of them, then he has 36 - 3 = 33 biscuits left. Now, if he eats another biscuit, he will have 33 - 1 = 32 biscuits left. So, the number of biscuits Pako had after eating the third one is 32.
Response:  The Pac-Man ate 36 pellets and gave 14 to his friend. So, he had 22 pellets left (36 - 14 = 22).
Response:  The packer ate 41 biscuits and gave 9 to his friend. So, he had 32 biscuits left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 more biscuits. Therefore, he has 50 biscuits left (32 + 18 = 50).
Response:  The packer ate 6 biscuits and gave 30 to his friend. So, he had 30 - 6 = 24 biscuits left. Then, he ate 23 more biscuits, so he has 24 + 23 = 47 biscuits left now.
Response:  We know that Pako had 97 biscuits and 34 glucose tablets initially. He ate 15 biscuit sandwiches and 56 almonds. So, how many glucose tablets did Pako have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of biscuit sandwiches he ate from the initial amount of glucose tablets he had:  Number of glucose tablets left = Initial number of glucose tablets - Number of biscuit sandwiches eaten = 34 - 15 = 19 Therefore, Pako had 19 glucose tablets left after eating the biscuit sandwiches and almonds.
Response:  We know that Pako had 26 biscuits and 17 sweets in total. He ate 14 biscuits and 9 sweets. So, we can calculate how many biscuits Pako had left: Number of biscuits Pako had = Total number of biscuits - Number of biscuits eaten = 26 - 14 = 12 Therefore, Pako had 12 biscuits left.
Response:  We know that Pako had 39 biscuits and 6 almonds. He ate 23 biscuits and 32 almonds. So, we can write an equation: 39 - 23 = x Where x is the number of biscuits Pako ate. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use subtraction: 39 - 23 = 16 Therefore, Pako ate 16 biscuits.
Response:  We know that Pako had 40 biscuits and 25 almonds. He ate 28 biscuits and 15 almonds. So, he has 40 - 28 = 12 biscuits left. Now, we need to find out how many more almonds he ate than biscuits. We can do this by subtracting the number of almonds he ate from the total number of almonds he had: 15 - 12 = 3. Therefore, Pako ate 3 more almonds than biscuits.
Response:  At first, Guernsey received $700. Then she spent some money and had $50 left. So, the amount of money that Guernsey has now is $50 + $700 = $750.
Response:  The Gkoun received $8 and now has $6 left. So she lost $2. Therefore, the amount of money she got for her genethlia is $2.
Response: Γk received $2 from her mom and the babysitter gave her $4 more. If she spent $3, how much did she have left? So, Γk had $6 left ($2 + $4 - $3).
Response:  The grandmother gave her $8. If the babysitter gave her $5 more, then the total amount of money the grandmother gave her is $13 ($8 + $5). Now, if the babysitter took back $4, then the amount of money the grandmother has left is $9 ($13 - $4). So, the answer is $9.
Response:  The girl received $3 from her mother and $6 from her grandmother. If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($3 + $6 - $4). So, the girl received more money from her grandmother than from her mother.
Response: Γk received $5 from her father and her mother gave her $7 more. If she spends $4, how much money did she receive from her mother? We can write this as: Γk received $5 + $7 = $12 from her mother. So, if she spends $4, she will have $12 - $4 = $8 left.
Response:  The grandmother gave her $8. So, the total amount of money that Guinevere received from her father is: $5 + $8 = $13. Now, let's see how much more she received from her mother. Her mother gave her $2 more, so the total amount of money that Guinevere received from both parents is: $13 + $2 = $15.
Response:  At first, Tzos had 9 balls in his collection. Then he lost some of them. So, let's say he has 4 balls left now. To find out how many balls he lost, we can divide the number of balls he had initially (9) by the number of balls he has now (4): 9 / 4 = 2. Therefore, Tzos lost 2 balls.
Response:  If Tzos had 21 baskets of fruit and gave away 12 baskets, then he has 9 baskets left (21 - 12 = 9).
Response:  At first, Tzos had 19 balls in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them and found 5 new ones. So, at this point, he has 19 - 11 = 8 remaining balls. Finally, he found 5 more balls, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 balls in total. Therefore, Tzos currently has 13 balls in his collection.
Response:  Tzos had 4 balls in his collection initially. He lost 16 balls and found 8 of them. So, he has fewer balls than he started with. To find out how many fewer balls he has, we can subtract the number of balls he found from the initial number of balls he had: 4 - 8 = -4 balls. Therefore, Tzos has -4 balls fewer than he started with.
Response:  The number of balls that Jos had initially was 7. After he lost 8 balls, he had 7 - 8 = 1 ball left. Then, he found 10 additional balls, so now he has 1 + 10 = 11 balls in total. Therefore, the number of extra balls that Jos found is 11 - 7 = 4 more balls than the ones he initially had.
Response:  We know that Tzos had 21 balls in his collection and he found 7 of them to be defective or damaged. So, the number of good balls he has now is:  21 - 7 = 14.
Response:  At first, Τζος had 20 balls in his collection. Then he gave 2 balls to Jack. So, Τζος has 18 balls left (20 - 2 = 18).
Response:  At first, Τζος had 22 balls in his collection. Then, Jack gave him 20 balls. So, now Τζος has 22 - 20 = 2 balls left in his collection.
Response:  If he had 11 balls before and lost 4, then he has 7 balls left (11 - 4 = 7). Now, if he gained 3 more balls, he would have 10 balls in total (7 + 3 = 10). So, his current number of balls is 10.
Response:  At first, Tzos had 22 balls in his collection. Then he found 13 balls and lost 5 balls. So, now he has 22 - 13 + 5 = 14 balls left in his collection.
Response:  We know that Tzos had 15 balls in his collection and found 9 basketballs. So, he lost 6 balls (15 - 9 = 6). Therefore, Tzos lost more than 23 balls (23 - 6 = 17) compared to the number of balls he found (9).
Response:  We know that Tzos had 3 balls in his collection and he lost 5 marbles. So, the number of marbles he has left is 3 - 5 = -2 marbles. Now, we are asked how many more marbles Tzos found than the ones he lost. Since he found 6 marbles, the difference between the number of marbles he found and the number he lost is 6 - (-2) = 8 marbles. Therefore, Tzos found 8 more marbles than the ones he lost.
Response:  The father and son had 8 fridges (4 + 4). Each fridge weighed 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the fridges was: 8 x 40 = 320 kg. Now, let's compare the weight of the fridges owned by Marko's father with those owned by Marko: Marko's father had 5 fridges that weighed 5 x 40 = 200 kg more than Marko's. So, the difference in weight between the two sets of fridges was: 320 - 200 = 120 kg.
Response:  The father and son had 35 kilograms of sweets between them. Mark had 5 kilograms of sweets. So, if we subtract the amount of sweets that Mark had from the total amount of sweets that the father and son had, we get: 35 kg - 5 kg = 30 kg. Therefore, the difference in weight between the sweets of the father and son is 30 kilograms.
Response:  The father of Mark and his dog had 20 kilograms of meat between them. Since the father of Mark had 5 kilograms less than the total amount of meat, we can calculate how much meat there was in total as follows: Total weight of meat = Weight of meat + Weight of father's share - Weight of dog's share = 20 kg + (5 kg - 20 kg) = 15 kg So, the weight of meat that Mark's father had was 15 kilograms.
Response:  The father of Mark and Babas had 32 kilograms of food, while Mark and Babas had 8 kilograms of food together. So, if they shared their food equally, each of them would have how much food?  Solution:  To find out how much food each person will have, we need to divide the total amount of food (32 + 8 = 40) by 2. Therefore, each person will have 20 kilograms of food.
Response:  Mark and his father had 24 kilograms of meat that they were going to grill. On their way back home, Mark lost 9 kilograms of meat. So, the amount of meat left with Mark is 15 kilograms (24 - 9 = 15). Now, we need to find out how much meat Mark's father had initially. Since Mark lost 9 kilograms of meat, his father must have had 3 kilograms of meat more than what he originally had (15 - 9 = 6). Therefore, Mark's father had 6 kilograms of meat initially.
Response:  At first, Mark and his dad were going to mix 36 kilograms of flour. Together they mixed 34 kilograms of flour that was heavier than 36 kilograms because one kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. So, they had 2 kilograms less than the original amount. Now, let's calculate how much flour Mark's dad has now. If he had 34 kilograms of flour initially and he lost 2 kilograms, then he has 34 - 2 = 32 kilograms of flour left. Therefore, the correct answer is 32 kilograms.
Response:  At first, Mark and his dog walked together and collected 22 kilograms of garbage. Then, on their way back, the dog found additional 30 kilograms of garbage. After that, Mark's dog collected 36 kilograms of garbage in total. Therefore, the number of kilograms of garbage collected by Mark's father is:  36 kg - 22 kg = 14 kg
"Response:  The father of Mark and Babas had 5 kilograms of apples. If Mark and Babas together had 37 kilograms of apples, then we can calculate how much each of them had as follows:

Mark had x kilograms of apples, since he alone had 37 kilograms minus the 5 kilograms his father had. Therefore, we have the equation:
x = 37 - 5 = 32 kilograms

Similarly, Babas had y kilograms of apples, since he alone had 37 kilograms minus the 5 kilograms his father had. Therefore, we have the equation:
y = 37 - 5 = 32 kilograms

Now, we are asked to find out how many kilograms of apples the father had. We know that the total weight of apples possessed by Mark, Babas, and their father is 94 kilograms (5 + 32 +?). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
94 = x + y + z
where z is the weight of apples possessed by the father. Substituting the values we know, we get:
94 = 32 + y + z

Now, we can solve for y by subtracting 32 from both sides of the equation:
62 = y
Therefore, the father of Mark and Babas had 62 kilograms of apples."
Response:  The father's fridges contained 30 kilograms of food, and when Mark and his friend combined them, they weighed 17 kilograms less. So, the difference in weight between the father's fridges and those of Mark and his friend is 13 kilograms (30 - 17 = 13). Therefore, the father's fridges were 13 kilograms heavier than those of Mark and his friend.
"Response:  The father's frisbees weighed 5 kg each. If Mark and his dad together had 26 kg of frisbees, then the number of frisbees they had was:

Number of frisbees = Total weight of frisbees / Weight of one frisbee
= 26 kg / 5 kg
= 5.2 kg

So, there were 5.2 kg of frisbees more belonging to the father than to Mark."
Response:  The father of Mark has 5 kilograms of potatoes. If Mark and his friend together have 30 kilograms of potatoes, then we can calculate how many kilograms Mark had individually as follows:  Number of kilograms of potatoes owned by Mark = Total number of kilograms of potatoes / 2 (since Mark and his friend together own 30 kilograms) = 5 kg / 2 = 2.5 kg
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then, other children got on the bus, making the total number of children 10. So, compared to before the stop, there are 8 more children in the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children in the bus. Then, another 38 children got on the bus, so the total number of children in the bus now is 26 + 38 = 64. Therefore, there are 64 children in the bus currently.
Response:  At first, there were 2 children in the bus. Then, 2 more children got on the bus, so now there are 4 children in total. Finally, 39 children got off the bus, leaving 4 children still on it. Therefore, before the stop, there were 4 children in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 43 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off the bus. After that, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number and the final number, which is:  43 - 21 = 22
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the school bus. Then, some of them got off at the stop. After that, there were 18 children left in the bus. So, how many more children were there in the bus before than there are now? We need to find the difference between the initial number and the current number. The difference is 23 (41 - 18). Therefore, there were 23 more children in the bus before than there are now.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 of them got off at the stop while some others entered the bus. So, the number of children left in the bus was 16. Therefore, the number of children who got off at the stop is 10 - 16 = -4.
Response:  At first, there were 5 children in the bus (line 1). Then, 20 children got off the bus (line 2), and 14 remained in the bus (line 3). So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who remained in the bus minus the number of children who were already in the bus initially. Therefore, the answer is: 20 - 5 = 15.
Response:  At first, there were 36 children in the bus station. Then, 68 children got off from the bus and entered the bus station, while some other children left the bus station. Therefore, there were 12 children left in the bus station. To find out how many more children got off from the bus than entered it, we need to subtract the number of children who left the bus station from the total number of children who got off the bus: 68 - 12 = 56. So, 56 more children got off the bus than entered it.
Response:  At first, there were 22 children in the bus. Then, 18 children got off the bus at stop 40, leaving 4 children still on the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus at stop 40 is 18. Therefore, the number of children who remained on the bus after they got off is 4.
Response:  At first, there were 28 children in the bus. Then, 82 children got off the bus and 30 children got on the bus. So, the number of children who got on the bus is equal to the number of children who got off the bus minus the number of children who were already on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus = 82 - 30 = 52.
Response:  At first, there were 23 children in the bus. Then, 4 children got off the bus, leaving 19 children inside. After that, 8 more children boarded the bus, so the total number of children inside the bus was 27. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who boarded is 4 (4 - 8 = -4).
Response:  The fox stole 51 chickens out of 133 in total. So, if the Beiker stole more than 51 chickens from those that the fox stole, then he stole (133 - 51 =) 82 additional chickens.
Response:  The fox has already caught 54 rabbits and sold some of them. If it still has 13 rabbits left, then it must have sold __________ rabbits.
Response:  The fox had 145 kicks and left 72 kicks behind. So, if the fox had remaining 72 kicks, then it means that he kicked 73 kicks in total. Therefore, the answer is 73.
"Response:  The baker received 155 cookies from the oven and gave 140 to his friend. So, the number of cookies that the baker had left was:

155 - 140 = 15

Therefore, the baker had 15 cookies left."
Response:  The fox caught 105 rabbits and sold them for 170 euros each. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the fox is: 105 x 170 = €17,750. So, the fox has earned €17,750.
Response:  The fox stole 91 chickens and sold them for 154 euros. So, the profit made by the fox is: Profit = Selling price - Cost = 154 - 91 = 63 euros. Therefore, the fox made 63 euros in profit.
Response:  The fox caught 78 rabbits and sold them for 31 euros each. So, how much money did the fox make? We need to multiply the number of rabbits caught by the price per rabbit: €31 x 78 = €2460. Therefore, the fox made €2460.
Response:  The first time the fox dug up 110 earthworms and sold 75 of them. Then he dug up again and found 76 more worms. So, if he had already sold 75 worms, then he has 40 ( = 110 - 75) worms left.
Response:  The baker made 71 cookies from the initial batch of 144. So, there were 73 remaining cookies (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made 11 more cookies after that. Therefore, the total number of cookies the baker made is: 73 + 11 = 84 cookies.
Response:  The fox had 149 chicks and 91 eggs. If it hatched 10 chicks and 90 eggs, how many chicks would the fox have? So, the fox would have 10 + 9 = 19 chicks in total.
Response:  The fox had 7 rabbits and 148 carrots. If he sold 15 rabbits and 103 carrots to the baker, how many carrots did the baker get? We know that the total number of carrots is equal to the number of rabbits plus the number of carrots. So, in this case, the baker got 103 + 15 = 118 carrots.
Response:  The fox caught 126 rabbits and 48 hares. If it released 115 rabbits and 81 hares, how many more rabbits than hares did the fox release? We know that the total number of animals released is equal to the total number of animals caught plus the number of animals released. So we can write: 126 + (115 - 81) = 48 + x, where x is the number of rabbits released minus the number of hares released. Solving for x, we get: x = 34. Therefore, the fox released 34 more rabbits than hares.
Response:  The fox caught 19 rabbits and 131 hares. If it released 70 rabbits and 88 hares, how many more hares than rabbits did the fox release? We know that the total number of small game (rabbits + hares) is equal to the total number of large game (deer + wild boar). So if the fox released x hares, then it must have hunted y deer and z wild boars, where x = y + z. Since there are 4 times as many hares as deer, we can write x = 4y. Substituting this equation into the first equation, we get 4y = y + z. Solving for y, we find that the fox released 32 hares more than it hunted deer.
Response:  The fox caught 157 rabbits and 169 hares. If he caught 158 rabbits and 147 hares more than that, how many did he catch? So, the answer is 158 + 147 = 295.
Response:  The fox caught 54 rabbits and 143 hares. If it released 68 rabbits and 92 hares more than it caught, then...
Response:  If the fox had 44 chicks initially and it ate 48 chicks in total, then we can calculate how many chicks the fox would have eaten if it had started with 48 chicks originally as follows: Number of chicks the fox ate = Total number of chicks the fox started with - Initial number of chicks the fox had (which is given in the question) So, in this case, the number of chicks the fox ate = 48 - 44 = 4 Now, to find out how many chicks the fox would have had if it had started with 48 chicks originally, we need to subtract the number of chicks it ate from the original number of chicks: Number of chicks the fox would have had if it had started with 48 chicks originally = Original number of chicks - Number of chicks the fox ate So, in this case, the number of chicks the fox would have had if it had started with 48 chicks originally = 48 - 4 = 44 Therefore, the correct answer is 44.
Response:  The fox stole 8 chickens. If it had originally stolen 40 chickens, how many fewer chickens did the fox steal from what it originally stole? So, the answer is 32 (40 - 8).
Response:  The friend of the baker stole 137 loaves of bread from him. If he had originally had 169 loaves, how many loaves would he have left?
"Response:  The fox caught 103 new rabbits and sold them for $86 each. So, the total amount of money the fox made is:

$86 x 103 = $8,958

So, the fox has made $8,958 in total."
Response:  The fox stole 99 chickens and sold them for 167 euros. So, he made a profit of 68 euros per chicken (167 - 99 = 68). Since he sold 89 chickens, he made a total profit of 5,722 euros (68 x 89 = 5,722).
Response:  The fox has 8 kits. It raised 139 and sold 145 turtles. So, it must have sold 16 (145 - 139) turtles more than it raised. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  The fox had 62 chicks initially and then took away 149 more. It sold 144 of them. So, how many chicks does the fox have now?  We can start by adding the initial number of chicks to the number it took away: 62 + (149 - 144) = 62 + 5 = 67 chicks. Therefore, the fox has 67 chicks now.
Response:  The baker made 81 cookies initially and then added 92 more. He sold 46 of them. So, the number of cookies that the baker made is:  81 + (92 - 46) = 81 + 46 = 127 cookies.
Response:  The baker had 108 cookies and 44 glazed donuts. If he sold each cookie for $2 and each glazed donut for $3, how much money did he make in total?
Response:  The baker had 56 cookies and 124 keys. If he sold 104 keys and 29 cookies, then he would have __________ cookies left. So, the answer is 29.
Response:  The fox caught 52 rabbits and 84 chickens. If it released 102 chickens and 94 rabbits more than it caught, then...
Response:  The fox caught 134 rabbits and 11 hares. If it hunted 140 rabbits and 92 hares more than it caught, then...
Response:  The fox caught 14 rabbits and 153 hares. If it released 8 hares and 97 rabbits more than hares, then...
Response:  The baker made 43 cookies and 114 candies. If he sold 154 candies and 78 cookies more than he baked, then...
Response:  Kelli has 22 Nintendo games and wants to have 140 in total. To find out how many more she needs, we can subtract the number of games she already has from the desired total: 140 - 22 = 118. So, Kelli needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games.
Response:  If Kéli has 106 toys of Nindento and gives away 64 of them, then she will have 42 toys left (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  If Kéli had initially given Ninendo 91 pawns and now has to give her 92 more, then we need to find out how many pawns Kéli gave Ninendo in total. We know that at first, Kéli gave Ninendo 91 pawns, so let's add this number to the total amount of pawns she needs to give her now: 91 + 92 = 183 pawns. Therefore, Kéli gave Ninendo 183 pawns in total.
Response:  We know that Kéli has 20 pieces of Níndento and 70 pieces of Sóny. To have 12 pieces of Níndento, we need to find out how many pieces of Níndento Kéli needs to give away. So, let's divide the number of pieces of Níndento Kéli wants (12) by the total number of pieces of Níndento she has (20):  $ \frac {12} {20} = \frac {6}{10}$. Therefore, Kéli needs to give away $\boxed {6}$ pieces of Níndento.
Response:  We know that Kéli has 46 ninjas and 132 Sonic characters. To have 31 Sonic characters, Soni needs to give away 105 Sonic characters (31 - 105 = -74). So, Soni needs to give away 74 Sonic characters.
Response:  If Kéli has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 of them to be Ninendo games, then she has 59 non-Ninendo games left (80 - 31 = 59). To have exactly 20 non-Ninendo games, Kéli needs to give away 39 non-Ninendo games (59 - 20 = 39).
Response:  If Ran has 52 tetrominos to build his tower, and he uses 38 of them, then we can calculate how many tetrominos he had at the beginning as follows: Number of tetrominos used = Total number of tetrominos - Number of tetrominos used = 52 - 38 = 14 So, Ran had 14 tetrominos at the beginning.
"Response:  Since Ran has 97 tetrominos to build his tower, he can use at most 72 of them to build a tower that is at least as tall as the original one. So, we need to find out how many tetrominos are left after using 72 for building the tower. We have:

Number of tetrominos = 97 - Number of tetrominos used for the tower

Now, let's calculate the number of tetrominos used for the tower. If Ran uses 72 tetrominos, then he has:

Number of tetrominos used = 72

So, we can write:

Number of tetrominos = 97 - 72 = 25

Therefore, Ran has 25 tetrominos left after using 72 for building the tower."
Response:  The Ran has 79 tetrominos to play with. He uses 14 tetrominos to build a tower and 11 tetrominos to build a house. So, there are 64 remaining tetrominos.
Response:  To build a tower (pyrgo), Ran needs to use 27 cubes. So he has 31 cubes left over after building the pyrgo. Now, to build a house (spiti), Ran needs to use 53 cubes. Therefore, he used 26 cubes more than he had left over from building the pyrgo. In total, Ran used 59 cubes (27 + 26 = 59).
Response:  Ran has 37 tetrominos to build his structure. He uses 33 tetrominos to build the pyramid and 13 tetrominos to build the house. To find out how much more he used for the pyramid than for the house, we need to subtract the number of tetrominos used for the house from the total number of tetrominos used by Ran. So, the difference is: 33 - 13 = 20. Therefore, Ran used 20 more tetrominos to build the pyramid than he did to build the house.
Response:  The Ran has 86 tetrominos and uses 79 of them to build a tower and 82 for building a house. So, he used 3 more tetrominos (79 + 82 = 161) than he needed to build the house. Therefore, he used 161 - 79 = 82 additional tetrominos to build the house compared to the tower.
Response:  Ran...
Response:  The Ran has 95 tetrominos and uses 20 of them to build a house and 50 of them to build a tower. To find out how much more block he used for building the tower than for building the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used by the Ran. So, the difference between 50 and 20 is 30. Therefore, the Ran used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  Ran has 90 tetrominos to build his structures. He uses 89 tetrominos to build a house and 63 tetrominos to build a tower. So he used a total of 152 tetrominos (89 + 63). Therefore, he used more than 90 tetrominos to build both structures combined.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 different books in the series "" Crazy, Illegal School"". If you haven't read any of them yet, then the number of books you have read is equal to the number of books you haven't read minus 5. So, we can write: Number of books read = Number of books not read - 5 In this case, the number of books not read is 20 (since you haven't read any of them), so: Number of books read = 20 - 5 = 15 Therefore, you have read 15 books from the series ""Crazy, Illegal School""."
Response:  If you have read 13 books in the series and there are 20 books in total (as stated in the question), then we can calculate the percentage of books you have read as follows:  Percentage = (Number of books read / Total number of books) x 100 % Number of books read = 13 Total number of books = 20 So, you have read approximately 65% of the books in the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 different books and 10 different movies in the series "" Crazy, Stupid Love"". If you have read 12 books and watched 56 movies, then you still have 9 books left to read (since 22 - 12 = 9). So, the answer is 9."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 different books and 17 different movies in the series "" Crazy, Stupid Love"". If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still have 10 movies left to watch (7 - 1 = 10)."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 different books and 14 different movies in the series "" Crazy, Illegal School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies from this series, then we can calculate how many more books than movies exist in the series as follows: Number of more books = Total number of books - Number of books you have read Total number of books = 16 - 19 = -3 Number of more movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies you have watched Total number of movies = 14 - 13 = 1 So, there are 1 more movie than book in the series ""Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the series "" Crazy, Illegal School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 61 movies from this series, then we can calculate how many movies are left in the series as follows: Number of movies left = Total number of movies - Number of movies watched = 10 - 61 = -51 movies So, there are 51 movies left in the series ""Crazy School"" after watching all the available ones."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 different books and 11 different movies in the series "" Crazy, Stupid Love"". If you have read 13 books and seen 12 movies, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than movies as follows: Number of more books = Total number of books - Total number of movies = 13 - 12 = 1 So, you have read one more book than movie."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 different books and 17 different movies in the series "" Crazy, Stupid Love"". If you have read 7 books and seen 21 movies, then we can calculate how many movies you have not seen as follows: Number of movies not seen = Total number of movies - Number of movies seen = 17 - 21 = -4 movies So, you have not seen 4 movies from the series."
"Response:  If you have read 8 books from the series "" Crazy School"", then there are 6 more books left to be read (since there are 14 books in total). So, you still need to read 6 more books from the series."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different movies and 19 different books in the series "" Crazy School"". If you have watched 4 movies and have seen 34 of them, then you still have 28 movies left to watch (62 - 34 = 28). Similarly, if you have read 4 books and have finished reading 19 of them, then you still have 21 books left to read (19 + 4 = 21). Therefore, you have 28 movies and 21 books left to consume."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different movies and 21 different books in the series "" Crazy School"". If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then you still have 3 movies left to watch ( since you haven't seen any of them yet). So, the number of movies you still need to see is 3."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 different movies and 15 different books in the series "" Crazy, Stupid Love School"". If you have read 11 books and watched 40 movies, then we can calculate how many more books than movies there are in the series as follows: Number of more books = Total number of books - Number of books read Total number of books = 15 - 11 = 4 Therefore, there are 4 more books than movies in the series ""Crazy, Stupid Love School""."

Response: Δev had 7 visits and used some of them to buy games. If he still has 2 visits left, how many visits did he use to buy games? So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If David had already used 12 tickets to buy games and he still has 14 tickets left, then he must have bought 2 games with his remaining 14 tickets. So, he gained 2 games.
Response:  If David had spent $5 for toys and $11 for clothes, he would have spent a total of $16 ($5 + $11). So, if he had 18 visits, he would have spent $16 x 18 = $276.
Response:  If David had 19 tickets and he used 12 for pachinko and 7 for roulette, then he has 19 - (12 + 7) = 19 - 19 = 0 remaining tickets. So, David did not have enough tickets to buy any more pachinko or roulette games.
Response:  If David had 13 tickets and he used 8 of them to buy chips, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5). Now, if he wants to buy clothes, he needs more tickets than he already has. So, he will use some of his remaining tickets to buy clothes. Let's say he uses 18 tickets for that. Therefore, after buying clothes, David has 0 tickets left (5 - 18 = 0).
Response:  If David won 14 bets and lost 2, he has a total of 16 bets (wins minus losses). If he used $10 for each bet, then the total amount of money he spent is $10 x 16 = $160. So, David spent $160 to win 14 bets.
Response:  We know that Xylia planted 14 trees in her backyard after Typhoon 9 died. So, we have to find out how many more trees died than those that survived.  Since 5 of the 14 trees (35%) died, we can assume that half of the remaining trees also died. Therefore, the number of dead trees is equal to half of the total number of trees minus the number of surviving trees.  In this case, the number of dead trees = (14 - 5) / 2 = 7.
Response:  At first, Hcheilie planted 13 trees in her garden. After six of them died (6/13), how many more trees survived than those that died? So, we have to find the difference between the number of surviving trees and the number of dead trees. The difference is 7 (13 - 6). Therefore, there were 7 more trees that survived than those that died.
Response:  At first, Hili planted 20 trees in her backyard. After one year, only 4 of them remained (since they died). So, we can say that 16 trees died during this time period (i.e., 20 - 4 = 16).
Response:  At first, there were 10 trees (not 12) that Héila planted in her backyard. After Typhoon 5 passed and destroyed all of them, how many trees did Héila plant again? The answer is zero because she didn't plant any new trees after losing all of them to the typhoon.
Response:  At first, she planted 9 trees in her garden. After that, 4 of them died. Then, she planted another 5 trees. So, the number of trees she has left is: Number of trees she had at first = 9 Number of trees she lost = 4 Number of new trees she planted = 5 Total number of trees she has now = Number of trees she had at first - Number of trees she lost + Number of new trees she planted = 9 - 4 + 5 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 trees left in her garden.
Response:  After the typhoon, two trees in the courtyard of Cheil's house died. If he had planted 12 trees originally, how many trees have remained? We know that after the typhoon, only half of the original number of trees survived (since two trees died). So, if Cheil had planted 12 trees initially, then half of them would be 6 trees. Therefore, 6 trees have remained.
Response:  We know that after the typhoon hit, 13 trees in the area of Heili died. If he had planted 3 seedlings initially, how many more trees died due to the typhoon compared to those that survived?  To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of surviving seedlings from the total number of dead trees. So, the answer is:  Number of additional deaths = Total number of dead trees - Number of surviving seedlings = 13 - 3 = 10. Therefore, 10 more trees died due to the typhoon than survived.
Response:  We know that after the typhoon, two trees in the field of Hilla died. If he had planted 11 trees originally, how many more trees grew from those that died?  To find out, we need to divide the number of trees that died (2) by the number of trees he initially planted (11). So, the answer is 5 more trees grew from those that died.
Response:  The passage states that after he saw the olives being pressed, he found out that they would produce 66 kilograms of oil per day. Now, we need to find out how many portions of 28 olives each there will be in a day if they produce 66 kilograms of oil. To do this, we can divide the total amount of oil produced (66 kg) by the number of olives needed to make one portion (28 olives). So, the answer is: Number of portions = Total amount of oil / Number of olives per portion = 66 kg / 28 olives = 2.4 portions per day.
"Response:  We know that after he saw the olives being pressed, it took 8 hours for them to produce 24 jars of olive oil. So, we can calculate how many hours it will take to make 8 sacks of olives into olive oil as follows:

Number of sacks = Number of jars / Number of olives per jar
= 8 / 16 (since each jar contains 16 olives)
= 0.5 hours/sack

Therefore, it will take approximately 0.5 hours to make one sack of olives into olive oil."
"Response:  If he saw that the portocals were being mixed for 4 minutes, and each mix lasted for 30 seconds, then in total there would be:

56 portocals x (4 minutes / 30 seconds per mix) = 1440 portocals mixed."
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""After 38 days had passed, they saw that the portocali were multiplying."" So, we know that in 38 days, each portocalium will have multiplied into 42 more portocaliums. Now, let's calculate how many total portocaliums there will be after 49 weeks (or 312 days) have passed:  Total number of portocaliums = Number of portocaliums at week 0 x (1 + Multiplication factor per week)^Number of weeks  Total number of portocaliums = 38 x (1 + 0.1367)^312 Total number of portocaliums = 15,749,600 Portocaliums!"
Response:  The question states that after watching the crabs carry their homes for 87 minutes, he learned that they would collect 66 sacks of sand during that time and each sack contains 25 portocali. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of portocali as follows: Total number of portocali = Number of sacks x Number of portocali per sack Total number of portocali = 66 x 25 = 1600 portocali So, there will be 1600 portocali after 87 minutes of carrying their homes.
Response:  The passage states that there are 8 sacks and each sack contains 35 portokali. Therefore, we have: Number of portokali = Total number of sacks x Number of portokali per sack  Number of portokali = 8 x 35 = 280 portokali. So, during the day, they will collect 280 portokali.
"Response:  We know that after 16 hours of work, they will have collected 16 sacks of potatoes, each containing 57 potatoes. To calculate how many hours it will take to collect 80 sacks of potatoes, we can divide the total number of potatoes (80) by the number of potatoes in each sack (57):

Number of hours = Total number of potatoes / Number of potatoes per sack
= 80 / 57
= 1.43 hours

So, it will take approximately 1 hour and 27 minutes (1.43 hours) to collect 80 sacks of potatoes."
"Response:  If they collect 67 sacks of potatoes per day and each sack contains 12 portokali, then...

Answer: 35 x 12 = 420 portokali

So, if they collect 35 sacks of potatoes per day, they will have collected in total 420 portokali."
Response:  The portokalia are cooked for 30 minutes and then left to cool down for 2 hours. After that, they will be peeled and sliced into 74 pieces. Each piece of portokalia weighs approximately 100 grams. Therefore, after 51 parts have been cut out, there will be 74 x 51 = 3690 grams of portokalia remaining.
Response:  The passage states that after watching the crabs carry their shells, he found out that they carried 76 shells in one day and dropped 64 of them. So, if each shell contains 50 portocali, then...
Response:  After 26 weeks of fusion, there will be 28 x 26 = 704 portions of rice left. So, in total, there will be 704 + 52 = 756 portions of rice after 26 weeks of fusion.
Response:  After 25 days of fermentation, the total volume of port wine will be 82 x 0.7 = 57.4 liters and the total volume of white port wine will be 61 x 0.7 = 43.7 liters. So, after 25 days of fermentation, the total volume of both red and white port wines together will be 57.4 + 43.7 = 101.1 liters.
Response:  The first portakali had 31 saki and the second one had 24 saki. After 45 minutes of mixing, they will have mixed together to create 55 saki (31 + 24) worth of portakali. Therefore, after 45 minutes of mixing, they will have 55 saki with ωριμά portakali.
Response:  The first sentence states that after he watched the crabs mate, he saw them carrying 44 eggs and 25 egg sacs. So, we know that there are a total of 69 egg sacs (44 + 25). Now, each egg sac can potentially hatch into multiple baby crabs, so let's assume an average of 3 babies per sac. Therefore, the number of baby crabs that will hatch from these egg sacs is: 69 x 3 = 207. So, there will be approximately 207 baby crabs hatching from the egg sacs that day.
Response:  The first part of the sentence says that after he watched the crabs crawling, he realized they were carrying 5 shells each. So, in total, there are 5 x 5 = 25 shells carried by the crabs.  Then, the second part of the sentence mentions that there are 74 shells more carried by the crabs. Therefore, the total number of shells carried by the crabs is 25 + 74 = 99 shells.
Response:  If they had to mix 54 portions of ice cream and it took them 3 hours to mix 18 portions, then we can calculate how long it would take to mix the remaining 36 portions as follows: Time = Total amount / Amount mixed per hour Time = 54 portions / 18 portions/hour = 3 hours Therefore, it would take 3 hours to mix the remaining 36 portions of ice cream.
Response:  The passage states that after they had eaten 56 portions of fish, they realized that they had consumed 14 portions per day. So, to find out how many days it took them to eat all those portions, we can divide the total number of portions (56) by the number of portions they ate per day (14): 56 / 14 = 4 days. Therefore, it took them 4 days to eat all those portions of fish.
"Response:  After 73 days of sunflower seeds being stored in a container with a hole at the top, we can calculate how many sunflower seeds will be left based on the information given in the problem.

The first part of the problem states that after 73 days, 25 full bags (each containing 100 sunflower seeds) and 5 empty bags (each containing 10 sunflower seeds) will remain. So, the total number of sunflower seeds remaining after 73 days is:

Full bags = 25 x 100 = 2500 sunflower seeds
Empty bags = 5 x 10 = 50 sunflower seeds
Total sunflower seeds = Full bags + Empty bags = 2500 + 50 = 2550 sunflower seeds

Therefore, after 73 days, there will be 2550 sunflower seeds left in the container."
"Response:  If there are 65 sacks of oranges and 46 sacks of apples per day, then in 6 days we will have:

Oranges: 65 x 6 = 390 sacks
Apples: 46 x 6 = 276 sacks
So after 6 days, we will have a total of:
390 + 276 = 666 sacks of fruit."
Response:  The first sentence states that after he watched the crabs mate, he saw them carrying 41 eggs and 86 eggs respectively. So, in total, there are 127 eggs carried by the male and female crabs combined. Therefore, the number of sacs containing eggs is 127.
Response:  The first sentence states that after he watched the crabs mate, he saw them carrying 71 egg sacs and 60 empty shells. So, we know that there were 71 + 60 = 131 egg sacs in total. Since each egg sac can potentially hatch into multiple baby crabs (depending on various factors like water quality, food availability, etc.), we can assume that these 131 egg sacs will eventually produce a large number of baby crabs. However, since the question only asks for the number of egg sacs carried by the crabs on that particular day, we can safely say that there are 131 egg sacs present at that time. Therefore, the answer is 131.
Response:  The length of Jésus' room is given as 12 meters and its width as 11 meters. To find out how much larger it is than the width, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, the difference between the length and width is: Length - Width = 12 - 11 = 1 meter. Therefore, Jésus' room is 1 meter longer than its width.
Response:  We know that the length of Tarzan's room is 2 meters. To find out how many square meters the room has, we need to multiply its length by its width. Since we don't have any information about the width of the room, let's assume it is equal to 1 meter (which means the area of the room is 2 square meters). Now, we are asked how much space Tarzan needs for his chalice. The volume of a cylinder (such as a chalice) is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height. In this case, since we don't know the exact dimensions of the chalice, let's use a rough estimate of 5 cm for the radius and 10 cm for the height (which gives us a volume of approximately 78.5 cubic centimeters). Finally, we want to convert the volume from cubic centimeters to meters, so we divide the volume by 1000 (since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter). This gives us a volume of approximately 0.0785 meters cubed. Therefore, Tarzan needs at least 0.0785 meters cubed of space around his chalice to avoid hitting his head or other parts of his body. Converting this volume back to square meters using the formula Area = Length x Width, we get an approximate value of 0.0069 square meters (or approximately 0.069 square feet). So, Tarzan needs at least 0.0069 square meters (or approximately 0.069 square feet) of clearance around his chalice to avoid injury.
Response:  We know that the length of Tarzan's room is 2 meters and he wants to place a sofa with a length of 14 tetragonal feet (which is equal to 5.67 meters). So we need to find out how many meters long is Tarzan's room. To do this, we divide the length of the sofa by the length of one meter: 5.67 / 1 = 5.67 meters. Therefore, the length of Tarzan's room is 5.67 meters.
"Response:  The room has a length of 3 meters and a width of 4 meters. To cover all the floor area, we need to calculate how many square meters are left after covering the existing area with the rug. So, we can subtract the area of the rug from the total area of the floor to find out how much more space is needed.
The area of the rug is given as 16 square meters. Therefore, we can subtract this amount from the total area of the floor to find out how much more space is needed:
Total area of floor = Length x Width = 3 m x 4 m = 12 sqm
Area of rug = 16 sqm
So, the remaining space needed to cover the entire floor is:
Remaining space = Total area of floor - Area of rug = 12 sqm - 16 sqm = -4 sqm
Therefore, the room needs 4 square meters more to cover the entire floor area."
"Response:  The room of Tzes is 2 meters long and 12 meters wide. If each rug has an area of 4 square meters per meter length, then we need how many rugs to cover the entire floor?

Answer:  To find out how many rugs are needed, we can use the formula: Number of rugs = Total area of floor / Area of one rug.

Total area of floor = Length x Width = 2 m x 12 m = 24 square meters
Area of one rug = Length x Width = 4 sqm/m
Number of rugs = Total area of floor / Area of one rug = 24 sqm / 4 sqm/m = 6 rugs. Therefore, six rugs are needed to cover the entire floor."
Response:  We know that the total area of all rooms is equal to the length times width (in meters) of each room. So, we need to find out how many square meters are needed for all rooms.  The length and width of each room are given as 6 meters each, so the area of one room is 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we need 20 x 36 = 720 square meters of space to cover all the rooms. Therefore, the required area is 720 square meters.
Response:  The length of Jésus' room is given as 6 meters and its width as 6 meters too. To find out how much larger it is than the width, we can use the formula: Length = Width x 2 + Width. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Length = 6 x 2 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18 meters. So, Jésus' room is 18 meters long.
Response:  The distance between Tzesi's house and the point where she wants to place her tent is 10 tetragonal feet. If the distance between her house and the point where she wants to pitch her tent is 5 feet, then how long is the distance from her house to the point where she wants to pitch her tent? Distance = 10 - 5 = 5 feet. Therefore, Tzesi's house is 5 feet away from the point where she wants to pitch her tent.
Response:  Since Tzési needs a hall with an area of 10 square meters to cover her living space, and if the living space is 2 meters wide, then we can calculate the length as follows: Length = Width x Area / Size of Hall = 2 m x 10 m / 10 m² = 20 m The length of Tzési's living space is therefore 20 meters long.
Response:  The length of Tzesí's legs is 18 tetragonal feet, and her room is 4 long feet and 20 wide feet. To cover the entire floor, she needs to move 4 + 20 = 24 steps forward and 18 \* 4 = 72 steps to the side. Therefore, Tzesí needs 96 steps (24 + 72) to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling blouses is $23 x number of blouses sold = $527. Since Arkansas and Texas together made $230 during the contest, that means they sold 5 times as many blouses as each other ($230 / 2 = $115). So, Arkansas sold 115 blouses and Texas sold 115 blouses as well.
Response:  The Reese's Magical Maze game has 3 blimps that are sold during the duration of the contest. Each blimp costs $10. Therefore, the total cost of each blimp is $10.
"Response:  The total number of blades sold during the Arkansas race and the Texas Technology race was 95 blades. If they sold 47 blades during the duration of the Arkansas race, then how much money did they make from selling those blades?

Solution: To find out how much money they made from selling the blades, we need to multiply the number of blades sold (47) by the price per blade ($87). Therefore, the amount of money they made from selling the blades is:

$87 x 47 = $4,069

So, they made $4,069 from selling the blades during the duration of the two races."
Response:  The magician says that he has 106 dollars for each blouse he sells. If during the contest between Arkansas and Texas, 242 blouses were sold in total, then...
Response:  The magazines with razors cost $98 each. During the duration of Arkansas and Texas' race (which was 4 hours), they sold a total of 163 blimps. If they sold 89 blimps during Arkansas' race, how much money did they make from selling blimps during that time?  To find this amount, we need to multiply the number of blimps sold by the price of each blimp. So, if they sold 89 blimps during Arkansas' race, they made $8,572 ($98 x 89) in revenue from selling blimps during that time.
Response:  The magician says that he sold each razorback for $78 and that during the duration of the Arkansas race and the Texas Technology race, a total of 186 blenders were sold. If they sold 172 blenders during the duration of the Arkansas race, how much money did they make from selling the blenders?
"Response:  The total number of blouses sold is given as 183. Since each blouse costs $62, the total amount of money earned from selling blouses is:

$$ = \text {Number of blouses} \times \text{Price of each blouse} $$
= 183 \times 62
= 11,506

Now, let's find out how much money was earned from selling fans. We are told that each fan costs $99 and 31 fans were sold. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling fans is:

$$ = \text {Number of fans} \times \text{Price of each fan} $$
= 31 \times 99
= 3,049

So, in total, $11,506 + $3,049 = $14,555 was earned from selling both blouses and fans."
Response:  The magician has 67 dollars from each basket and 165 dollars from each fan. During the game, 74 baskets and 156 fans were sold. Therefore, the total amount of money earned is: 67 x 74 = $4932 + 165 x 156 = $25908 = $29840.
Response:  The cost of one Reizorbank is $192 and the cost of one fanela is $34. Therefore, we can calculate the cost per unit as follows: Cost per unit = Total cost / Number of units So, if we have 157 blouzaki and 19 fanels, the total cost would be: Total cost = 157 x $192 + 19 x $34 = $30,688 Now, to find out how much more expensive one blouzaki is than one fanela, we need to divide the difference in their costs by the cost of one fanela: Difference in cost = Total cost - Cost of one fanela = $30,688 - ($34 x 19) = $26,576 So, one blouzaki costs approximately $26,576 more than one fanela.
Response:  The cost of one Reizorbank is $86 and the cost of one fanela is $232. Therefore, we can calculate the cost per fanela as follows: Cost per fanela = Total cost / Number of fanelas Total cost = 254 x $86 + 43 x $232 = $19,704 Number of fanelas = 254 + 43 = 297 So, the cost per fanela is $19,704 / 297 = $66.57
Response:  The price of each blouse is $51, and they sell 130 blouses in total. So, their total revenue from selling blouses is:  $51 x 130 = $6,430. Now, we are told that they had an increase of $8 for each blouse sold, so their profit from selling blouses is: $6,430 + ($8 x 130) = $6,430 + $920 = $7,350. Therefore, they made a profit of $7,350 from selling blouses.
Response:  At first, we have to find out how much money did each of them make from selling their blades. We know that Arkanas sold his 20 blades for $200 each, so he made $4,000 ($200 x 20 blades). Texas also sold 14 blades for $217 each, so he made $2,958 ($217 x 14 blades). Now, let's add both amounts together to get the total amount they made from selling their blades: $6,958 ($4,000 + $2,958). Finally, we subtract the cost of the blades ( $200 x 20 blades = $4,000) and we are left with the profit they made from selling the blades: $2,958.
Response:  The Arkansas and Texas magicians together made $60 selling magic tricks. If they sell $10 from each trick they sell, how many tricks do they sell?
"Response:  The total amount of money won was $215 and Reizorbank had to sell 5 blouses. So, the cost price of each blouse is:
$215 / 5 = $43 per blouse"
Response:  The magician has 5 dollars from each fan and 215 dollars from each blouse. During the contest between Arkansas and Texas, 20 blouses and 64 fans were sold. How much money did they raise in total? We need to calculate this: Total amount of money raised = Number of blouses x Price per blouse + Number of fans x Price per fan In this case, we have: Total amount of money raised = 20 x $215 + 64 x $5 = $9,380 + $3,240 = $12,620 So, the total amount of money raised was $12,620.
Response:  The magician has 76 dollars from each fan and 204 dollars from each blouse. In total, he earned $158 for 158 blouses and $2 for 2 fans. Therefore, the amount of money that the magician earned selling fans is $2.
Response:  The cost of one Reizorbank is $210 and that of one Blouzak is $240. So, if we have 177 Blouzaks and 23 Phanels, then the total cost of all these items would be: Total Cost = Number of Blouzaks x Cost per Blouzak + Number of Phanels x Cost per Phanel Total Cost = 177 x $240 + 23 x $210 Total Cost = $45,690 + $4,830 Total Cost = $50,520 This means that one Blouzak costs more than one Phanel.
Response:  The cost of one Reizorbank is $115, and the cost of one Blouzak is $25. So, if we have x Blouzaks and y Phaneles, then the total cost will be: Total Cost = (x \* $25) + (y \* $115). To find out how much more expensive one Phanela is than one Blouzak, we can subtract the cost of one Blouzak from the cost of one Phanela: Difference = ($115 - $25) = $90. Therefore, one Phanela costs $90 more than one Blouzak.
Response:  The total number of coins is given as 5 sets with each set containing 10 more coins than the previous one. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Set 1 = 10 coins + x coins (where x is the number of coins in Set 2) Set 2 = x coins + (x \* 2) coins (where x is the number of coins in Set 3)... Set n = (n-1) coins + (n \* 2^(n-1)) coins (where n is the number of sets) Now, we need to find out how many coins are there in each set. Let's start from Set 1 and move towards Set n. We know that Set 1 contains 10 coins, so the value of x in Equation 1 is 10. Substituting this value into Equation 2, we get: Set 2 = 10 coins + x coins = 10 + 10 = 20 coins Now, we have found the number of coins in Set 2. Using the same approach, we can find the number of coins in Set 3, Set 4, and so on. Finally, we can add up all these numbers to find the total number of coins: Total number of coins = Set 1 + Set 2 + Set 3 +... + Set n = 10 + 20 + 30 +... + (n-1) \* 2^n =? To solve for the last expression, we can use mathematical induction. Assuming that the statement is true for some arbitrary value of n, we can prove it true for n+1 as well. That is, if the total number of coins in the first n sets is equal to, then the total number of coins in the (n+1)th set will be equal to. Therefore, the total number of coins is: Total number of coins = 10 + 20 + 30 +... + (n-1) \* 2^n = 2^n(n-1)! = 2^6(5!) = 64 This means that there are 64 coins in total.
Response:  We have two sets of cards with the same number of cards (10). So, we can divide the total number of cards among the two sets in any proportion. Let's assume that we divided them equally, so each set has 5 cards. Now, let's count how many cards are left for each set after removing one card from each set: Set A - 5 cards x 9 cards = 45 cards Left Set B - 5 cards x 8 cards = 40 cards Left Total number of cards left = 45 + 40 = 85 cards Therefore, there are 85 cards left after removing one card from each of the two sets.
"Response:  The given information is as follows:
Number of people = 5
Number of sets of trapezes = 3
Each set has 3 carrots.
If there were 6 more carrots in the backyard, how many sets of trapezes would they have?
To find out, we need to use multiplication and division. We can start with the number of carrots available before (3 x 3 = 9) and add the additional carrots (6). Therefore, the total number of carrots after adding the new ones will be 9 + 6 = 15. Now, let's divide this number by the number of sets of trapezes they had initially (3):
15 / 3 = 5
So, if there were 6 more carrots in the backyard, they would have 5 sets of trapezes instead of 3."
"Response:  The group of friends have 11 sets of trapezoids and each set has 13 carrots. So, in total they have:

11 sets x 13 carrots per set = 143 carrots

Therefore, the answer is 143 carrots."
Response:  We have 10 trapezes and each set has 6 carrots. If there are 11 people standing in carrots, how many carrots will be left?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of people from the total number of carrots. So, if there are 11 people standing in carrots, then 10 x 6 = 60 carrots - 11 = 49 carrots will remain. Therefore, there will be 49 carrots left.
"Response:  The company has 12 sets of trapezoidal tiles and each set contains 14 tiles. Therefore, the total number of tiles is:

12 sets x 14 tiles/set = 168 tiles

However, there are also 6 extra tiles left over, so the final answer is:

168 tiles + 6 extra tiles = 174 tiles

Therefore, the correct answer is 174 tiles."
Response:  Since there are 14 people in total and each set of trapezes has 3 karakels, we need to find out how many sets of trapezes there will be if all 14 people participate.  There are 4 sets of trapezes in total, so we can calculate the number of sets as follows: Number of sets = Total number of participants / Number of participants per set = 14 / 3 = 4.5 sets Therefore, there will be approximately 4.5 sets of trapezes for all 14 people to play with.
Response:  The number of cards each player has is given as 14 for both players. Therefore, the total number of cards in play is 28 (14 x 2). Since there are 9 sets of trapezes, each set contains 3 cards. So, the total number of cards that each player has beyond their initial hand size is 6 (9 - 14).
Response:  If Liouis wins $460 every week for 5 weeks in total, he will have won $2300 ($460 x 5).
Response:  The Liouuis gains $1216 cumulatively over time. If he earns $16 per week, how many weeks has he worked? We can set up an equation based on this information: Number of weeks = Total amount earned / Weekly income $1216 / $16 per week = 78 weeks So, the Liouuis has worked for 78 weeks.
Response:  The amount of money Lious makes per month is $21, so he has earned $453 in total during the period of 216 months ($21 x 216 = $453). To find out how much money he will have at the end of the period, we need to subtract the taxes he needs to pay from his total earnings. According to the question, he needs to pay $702 in taxes, so his final balance will be: $453 - $702 = -$249. Therefore, Lious will have negative $249 at the end of the period.
Response:  The Lioyis makes $1357 every month for 223 months. Therefore, he has earned $ $1357 x 223 = $296,011 in total during this period. If he works for 73 periods of synodic cycle, he will have earned $ $296,011 / 73 = $4008 per period.
Response:  The Liouis earns $28 per day for 1091 days. Therefore, he earned total amount of money = $28 x 1091 = $276430. Additionally, he earned $939 per day for hyperinflation. So, if he works as an accountant every day for the duration of the simulation, how much money does he make in total? Total amount of money made = $276430 + ($939 x number of days worked) =?
Response:  The amount of money Lious makes per month is $403. Since he works for 233 months, his total earnings are $87,590 ($403 x 233). Now, he has to pay $49 as taxes every month. So, his remaining earnings after taxes are $87,541 ($87,590 - $49).
Response:  The Liouuis gains $368 every month for 1359 months. To find out how much he pays as rent each month, we can use the formula: Rent = Monthly Income x Number of Months. So, Rent = $368 x 1359 = $472,770. Therefore, as a landlord, he pays $472,770 in rent every 1359 months.
Response:  The amount of money Lious makes per month is $491. Since he works for 1181 months, his total income during that time period is: $$ \text {Total Income} = \text {Monthly Income} \times \text {Number of Months} = $491 \times 1181 = $573,091 $$ Now, we need to find out how much money Lious has at the end of the period. To do this, we divide the total income by the number of months he worked: $$ \text {Ending Balance} = \frac{\text{Total Income}}{ \text{Number of Months}} = \frac {$573,091}{1181} = $491,000 $$ Therefore, Lious will have $491,000 at the end of the period.
Response:  For 19 weeks, Louis earns $133 per week. To calculate how much he earns in total, we can multiply the number of weeks by his weekly income: $133 x 19 = $2,507.
Response:  The Liouuis gains $2 per day for 30 days = $60. If he gains synolically $178 dollars, how many months did he save?  So, the number of months is $178 / $2 = 89 months.
Response:  The depth of the water is given as 10 times the height of Mount Din, which is 9 feet (or 2.7 meters) tall. So, if we assume that the depth of the water is proportional to its height, then the depth of the water would be 10 x 9 = 90 feet (or 27 meters) deep.
Response:  We know that after they dived, they decided to swim. The depth of the water is twice the height of Nino. Nino is 2 meters closer to Ron than Ron is to the bottom of the sea. If Ron is at a distance of 4 meters from the bottom of the sea, how deep was the water?  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question and apply some basic calculations. Firstly, let's find out how far Nino is from the bottom of the sea. Since he is 2 meters closer to Ron than Ron is to the bottom of the sea, Nino is 2 meters away from the bottom of the sea. So, the distance between Nino and the bottom of the sea is 2 meters + 4 meters = 6 meters. Now, we can find out how deep the water is by using the following formula: Depth = Distance / Height. In this case, the distance between Nino and the bottom of the sea is 6 meters, and the height of Nino is 2 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water is: Depth = 6 meters / 2 meters = 3 meters. So, the water was 3 meters deep.
Response:  The depth of the water is 5 times the height of Ron. Since Ron is 3 meters closer to the bottom than the depth of the water, we can say that the depth of the water is equal to 5 x (height of Ron). So, if the height of Ron is 10 meters, then the depth of the water would be 5 x 10 = 50 meters.
Response:  We know that after they dived, they reached a depth of 15 times their height. So if they are 1 meter taller than Ron, and Ron is at a distance of 4 meters from the surface, then we can calculate the depth as follows: Depth = (15 x Height) + (4 - Height) Where Height is the height of Ron in meters. Now we have to find out how tall Ron is. According to the question, Ron is 1 meter shorter than Din. So Ron's height is 1 meter less than Din's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is: Depth = (15 x (Din's height - 1)) + (4 - (Din's height - 1)) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Depth = (15 x 9) + (4 - 8) = 135 + (-6) = 129 meters Deep.
Response:  We know that after they dived, they reached a depth of 16 times their height. So if Ron is 3 meters taller than Din, and he is at a depth of 4 meters, then we can calculate how deep the water was as follows: Water Depth = (Ron's Height x Number of Times He Is Deeper) + Din's Height Water Depth = (3 x 16) + 3 = 48 + 3 = 51 meters Deep The water was 51 meters deep.
Response:  The depth of the water is 9 times the height of Ron. If Ron is 5 meters tall and Din is 6 meters shorter than Ron, how deep was the water? We know that the depth of the water is 9 times the height of Ron, so we can write: Depth = 9 x Height Of Ron = 9 x 5 = 45 meters Deep Water
Response:  Mr. Brain has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among two shelves so that each shelf contains an equal number of books. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can assume that Mr. Brain wants to organize his books into 7 categories (shelves) based on their subject or genre. So, if he divides his 34 books equally among 2 shelves, then each shelf will contain 17 books (34 / 2 = 17).
"Response:  If Brain has 42 books and each book contains 2 pages, then...

1. The number of pages in all Brain's books is 42 x 2 = 84 pages.
2. Since there are 7 days in a week, if Brain reads one page per day, he will finish reading all his books in 84 / 7 = 11 days.
3. Therefore, Brain has 11 days to read all 42 books."
Response:  Mr. Brain has 27 books and 80 magazines in total. If he has some of them in each of the 23 rooms, then we need to find out how many books and magazines he has in each room. For example, if he has 5 books in Room A, 3 books in Room B, and 2 books in Room C, then he has a total of 10 books (5 + 3 + 2) in those three rooms combined. Similarly, if he has 40 magazines in Room A, 20 magazines in Room B, and 10 magazines in Room C, then he has a total of 70 magazines (40 + 20 + 10) in those three rooms combined. So, the number of books and magazines that Mr. Brain has in each room can be calculated separately, and then added up to get the overall total. Therefore, the answer is 27 + 80 = 107.
Response:  If Brain has 9 books and 46 magazines in total, and he reads one magazine per day, then he will have read all of his magazines after 46 days. So, if we subtract the number of days Brain has been reading from the total number of magazines he owns, we get the number of magazines he still has left. In this case, that would be 46 - 46 = 0 magazines, since Brain has already read all of them. Therefore, Brain still has 46 magazines left.
Response:  The book collection of Brain consists of 23 books and 61 magazines from any of the 29 regions he has visited. To find out how many books and magazines Brain has in total, we need to multiply the number of regions he has visited by the average number of books or magazines he owns per region. If Brain has visited 6 regions with an average of 4 books per region, then he has 6 x 4 = 24 books. Similarly, if Brain has visited 5 regions with an average of 12 magazines per region, then he has 5 x 12 = 60 magazines. Therefore, Brain has a total of 24 + 60 = 84 books and magazines.
"Response:  The book collector has 7 racks with the same number of books (28). So, we can divide the total number of books (28) by the number of racks (7):

Number of books in each rack = Total number of books / Number of racks
= 28 / 7
= 4
Therefore, there are 4 books in each rack."
"Response:  If Brain has 38 books in total and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then we can calculate the number of bookshelves as follows:
Number of bookshelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 38 books / 2 books per shelf
= 19 bookshelves
Therefore, Brain has 19 bookshelves."
Response:  Carol has 10 friends and each friend receives 2 requests for help. To avoid any of her friends leaving, she needs to have at least 20 requests in total (2 x 10 = 20). Therefore, the number of packages required is 20.
"Response:  Since there are 12 friends and each friend has to guess 5 numbers, we have:
Number of possible combinations = Number of friends x Number of guesses per friend = 12 x 5 = 60
So, each pouch contains 60 possibilities for the combination of numbers that the friend might choose."
Response:  Carol received 35 requests (10 per package x 7 packages). If she sends only two requests to her friends, then the number of remaining requests is:  35 - 2 = 33. So, 33 requests will remain unsent.
Response:  Carol received 35 requests (14 x 2 + 6). After she rejected some of them, she had 11 remaining requests. So, the number of friends she could call is 11 / 2 = 5.
Response:  Carol received 5 requests from her friends and each request had 3 options to choose from, so she received in total 15 options (5 x 3 = 15). Since she bought 2 sets of options, she has 7 remaining options left (15 - 2 = 7). To call 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 2 sets of options (7 + 2 = 9), since each set contains 3 options. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game, then she scored a total of 12 x 5 = 60 points in all games. So, if she played 36 games in total, she played 60 / 36 = 1.75 games per day.
Response:  In each game, Melissa scored 81 points in total, which means she scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27). So, in the first game, she scored 27 points, in the second game she scored 54 points (since she scored 27 + 27), and in the third game she scored 98 points (since she scored 54 + 44). Therefore, the number of points Melissa scored in each game is as follows: Game 1: 27 points, Game 2: 54 points, Game 3: 98 points.
Response:  The Melissa scored 109 points in each game and also got 82 points in each game. So, if she played 79 games, then she scored 79 x 109 = 8643 points.
Response:  Melissa played chess for 21 moves and scored 7 points in each game. Therefore, she played a total of 21 x 7 = 147 games.
Response:  Melissa has scored 91 points in total across 13 games, and she has scored the same number of points (91) in each game. Therefore, we can conclude that she scored 7 points per game (91 / 13 = 7).
Response:  Since there are 4 seats in the Paradeisou's wagon and 20 people can ride it at the same time, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many times each seat can accommodate an individual. Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{5} $. So, each seat in the wagon can accommodate 5 individuals simultaneously.
Response:  The Paradeisou train has 36 seats (9 seats per car x 4 cars). If 18 people can ride the train simultaneously, then each car will have 2 seats left empty (18 - 9 = 9). Therefore, the Monaco train has 9 seats available for passengers.
"Response:  We know that each truck can carry 15 people. So, if we have 19 trucks, then the total number of people who can be carried is:

19 x 15 = 285

So, 285 people can be carried by all 19 trucks together."
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in the Paradeisou circle and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total number of people who can participate in the parade is:

18 seats x 15 people per seat = 270 people
So, if 10 chairs collapse, 270 / 10 = 27 people will be able to continue dancing in the circle."
Response:  The Paradeisou train has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. If there are currently 16 people in the waiting room, how many others can join the train? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people already in the waiting room from the total capacity of the train. So, the answer is: 16 - 14 = 2. Therefore, two other people can join the train.
Response:  The small trough has 2 positions and can hold 14 people each. Therefore, the total number of people who can make jumps in the small trough is 2 x 14 = 28 people.  Similarly, the large trough has 23 positions and can hold 54 people altogether. So, the total number of people who can make jumps in both troughs together is 23 + 54 = 77 people.
Response:  The small trough has 3 small compartments and can hold 16 people each. Therefore, in total, it can hold 3 x 16 = 48 people.  Now, let's consider the large trough. It has 7 large compartments and can hold 12 people each. So, in total, it can hold 7 x 12 = 84 people.  Therefore, a maximum of 84 + 48 = 132 people can make jumps on Feris' trough.
Response:  We have 16 people who want to cross the Paradeisou bridge at the same time. Since each person can hold onto one of the four ropes that make up the bridge, we need to find out how many times 16 goes into 4.  To do this, we divide 16 by 4: 16 ÷ 4 = 4 So, if there are 16 people trying to cross the bridge simultaneously, it can accommodate 4 groups or batches of people.
Response:  If there are 10 people in total and they can all fit on one side of the park (let's say it's 5 meters wide), then each person can occupy 0.2 meters of space (since 10 x 0.2 = 2 meters). Now, if we divide this number by 2 since each person is facing another person, we get 0.1 meters per person (since 2 / 2 = 1 meter). So, each person can stand at most 0.1 meters away from their neighbor.
Response:  If we have 7 pits and each pit has the same number of feet, then the total number of feet in all pits is equal to the number of feet in one pit multiplied by 7. So, if there are 14 feet in one pit, then there are 14 x 7 = 98 feet in all 7 pits combined.
Response:  We have 28 pieces of bread and each piece has 2 slices. So we can make 14 pizzas (28 / 2 = 14).
Response:  We have been given that we have made 17 pits and each pit has 4 feet. So, if there are 25 of us, how many feet will we have in total? To find out, we need to multiply the number of pits (17) by the number of feet in each pit (4). Therefore, the total number of feet we have is: 17 x 4 = 68 feet.
Response:  If we have 9 pits and each pit has 10 feet, then in total we have 9 x 10 = 90 feet. Now, if there are two of us, how many feet will each one get? To find this out, we need to divide the total number of feet by 2. So, 90 feet / 2 = 45 feet per person. Therefore, each person will get 45 feet of pits.
"Response:  If Peity helped her mother plant 10 seeds in each of 45 lilies, then we have to calculate how many seeds were planted overall. So, the total number of seeds planted is:

Number of lilies x Number of seeds per lily = Total number of seeds planted
= 45 lilies x 10 seeds/lily = 450 seeds
Therefore, 450 seeds were planted overall."
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and harvested 9 crops, then each crop contained how many seeds?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of seeds per crop = Total number of seeds / Number of crops Harvested seeds per crop = Number of seeds per crop x Number of loulioudi (9) So, if they planted X sporophytes in each loulioudi, the number of sporophytes that grew in each loulioudi is equal to the number of sporophytes that grew in all the loulioudia multiplied by 9. Therefore, we have: Number of sporophytes per loulioudi = Number of sporophytes that grew in all loulioudia x 9 Solution: The answer is 360 sporophytes per loulioudi.
Response:  The mother plant produced 36 seeds and each seed produced 12 plants, so the total number of plants produced was 36 x 12 = 432 plants. Since only 58 of these plants grew into mature size, we can say that out of every 4 plants, one will grow into a mature plant. Therefore, the number of mature plants produced by the mother plant was 432 / 4 = 108 mature plants.
Response:  The mother planted 55 seeds and produced 15 seedlings per tree, so she had 55/15 = 3.7 seedlings per tree. Since they only grew big enough to produce fruit in 60 days, we can say that each tree produced 60 / 3.7 = 16.4 trees worth of fruit. Therefore, they planted 16.4 x 55 = 928 fruit-bearing trees.
"Response:  If Peity had helped her mother plant 10 seeds per louli and they grew into plants that produced 60 fruits each, then we have to calculate how many louli were there in total. So, let's do it!

Total number of seeds planted = Number of seeds planted per louli x Total number of louli
= 10 seeds/louli x? (since we don't know the total number of louli)

Now, if 60 fruits were produced from each of these louli, then we can calculate the total number of fruits as follows:
Total number of fruits = Number of fruits produced per louli x Total number of louli
= 60 fruits/louli x? (again, we don't know the total number of louli)

So, putting everything together, we get:
Answer: The total number of louli was 120 (60 fruits / louli x 2 louli)."
Response:  Petra helped her mother plant 8 gardens with 32 seeds each. If they had planted the same number of seeds in each garden, how many spores did they plant in total? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of spores = Number of gardens x Number of seeds per garden Total number of spores = 8 x 32 = 256 spores So, Petra and her mother planted 256 spores in total.
Response:  If Máthius fed 3 biscuits to each of his 11 friends, then he gave a total of 3 x 11 = 33 biscuits. So, Máthius had 33 - 2 = 31 biscuits left.
Response:  If Máthius had 8 basketballs to give away to his friends, and he gave 2 balls to each of them, then he gave a total of 16 balls (8 x 2 = 16). So, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  If Máthius had 15 baskets of fruit and gave them equally to 5 friends, each friend would get 3 baskets (since 15 / 5 = 3). However, since there were already 10 baskets left over after giving them to the first 5 friends, each of the remaining 5 friends got only 2 baskets (since 10 / 5 = 2). Therefore, in total, each friend received 3 + 2 = 5 baskets of fruit.
Response:  If Máthios had 24 baskets of fruit and gave an equal number to each of his three friends, then he gave 8 baskets (24 / 3 = 8) to each friend. So, in total, Máthios gave 24 baskets of fruit to his friends.
Response:  If Máthius had 22 baskets of crockets and gave an equal number to each of his 11 friends, then he gave a total of 22 x 11 = 242 crockets. Since each friend received an equal amount, each friend received 242 / 11 = 21 crockets.
Response:  If Máthius had 29 baskets of apples and 30 bags of potatoes, and he gave equal amounts to two friends, then each friend received how much?  We know that the total amount of apples is 29, so if one friend got x apples, the other friend got x/2 apples. Similarly, the total amount of potatoes is 30, so if one friend got y potatoes, the other friend got y/2 potatoes. Now we can substitute these values into the equation: x + (x/2) = 14 (since Máthius had 29 apples in total) y + (y/2) = 20 (since Máthius had 30 potatoes in total). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 7, y = 14. So each friend received 7 apples and 14 potatoes respectively.
Response:  If Máthios had 14 biscuits and gave each of his 7 friends an equal number (not necessarily the same amount), then he distributed a total of 14 x 7 = 98 biscuits among them. Since there were also 21 keys given out, each friend received 98 / 7 = 14 biscuits and 21 keys.
Response:  If Máthios gave out equal numbers of biscuits to his 18 friends, then each friend received an equal number of biscuits. Therefore, if there were 36 biscuits in total, and 18 friends shared them equally, each friend would have received 2 biscuits (36/18 = 2).
Response:  If Máthios gave away 6 baskets of fruit to everyone he met, and he had 36 crockets (a unit of measurement for fruit), then we can calculate how many baskets he gave away per person as follows: Number of baskets given away = Total number of baskets / Number of people met So, in this case, the number of baskets given away per person is: Number of baskets given away/Number of people met = 6/x x represents the total number of people Máthios met, which we are asked to find out. Since there were 12 friends in total, we can set up the equation like this: Number of baskets given away/Total number of friends = 6/12 Solving for x, we get: x = 5 So, Máthios gave away 6 baskets of fruit to each of his 5 friends.
Response:  The teacher had 23 pencils and gave 11 to two friends. So, each friend got 5 pencils (11 / 2 = 5). Therefore, one friend received 5 pencils and the other friend received 5 pencils as well.
Response:  We know that Μάθιου had 31 baskets and gave 23 to his friends. So, he has 9 more baskets than he gave away (31 - 23 = 9). Therefore, Μάθιου gave 9 baskets to his friends.
Response:  The teacher gave equally sized candy to four friends. If there were initially 32 pencils and 98 keys, how many pencils did each friend get? We know that the total number of pencils given is equal to the total number of keys given, so let's call this amount x. Since there are 4 friends, the number of pencils each friend got is x/4. Therefore, the number of pencils each friend got is 32/4 = 8. So, each friend got 8 pencils.
Response:  The teacher gave equally sized candy to four friends. If each friend had 10 lollipops and 8 candies initially, how many candies did each friend eat? We know that there were 4 friends in total, so if one friend ate x candies, then the other three friends together ate 3x candies (since they shared equally). Therefore, the number of candies eaten by each friend is:  X = 2(3x) = 6x. So, each friend ate 6 times as many candies as they initially had.
Response:  If Máthios gave equal amounts of biscuits and cakes to his 28 friends, then he had 13 biscuits and 15 cakes initially (since he gave each friend an equal amount). So, if each friend received 4 biscuits or cakes from Máthios, then: Number of biscuits Máthios gave away = Initial number of biscuits - Number of biscuits given away per person = 13 - 4 = 9 Number of cakes Máthios gave away = Initial number of cakes - Number of cakes given away per person = 15 - 4 = 11 Therefore, Máthios gave away 9 biscuits and 11 cakes in total.
"Response:  If she drank 109 cups of water when she was in heat, and then she drank 74 cups of water for each of the next 3 days, how many cups of water did she drink in total?

To find out, we need to multiply the number of cups she drank each day by the number of days she drank them:

Total cups = Number of cups per day x Number of days
= 74 cups/day x 3 days
= 222 cups

So, she drunk 222 cups of water in total."
Response:  When Dembeas was in detention, he drank 153 cups of water. Now, we want to know how many cups of water he drank each day. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of cups of water he drank (153) by the number of days he was in detention (17). So, the answer is: 9 cups of water per day.
Response:  If she drank 264 cups of water when she was in detoxification and she drank 15 cups per day for 11 hours, then we can calculate how many cups she has drunk so far as follows: Total amount of water drunk = Number of days x Amount drunk per day So, total amount of water drunk = 11 x 15 = 165 cups Therefore, she has drunk 165 cups of water so far.
"Response:  If she drank 301 ml of water when she was in detoxification and she drank 144 ml per day for some days, then we can calculate how many days she drank that amount of water as follows:

Days = Total volume / Daily volume
= 301 ml / 144 ml/day
= 2.06 days
Therefore, she drank that much water for approximately 2.06 days."
Response:  If she drank 88 cups of water and 13 cups of coffee when she was in detoxification, then she had a total of 101 cups of liquid (88 + 13 = 101). Now, if she drank 4 cups of water and 87 cups of coffee during the day, how many hours would it take for her to drink all those cups? We know that 1 cup of coffee is equivalent to 200 ml, so she drank a total of 87 x 200 = 17400 ml of coffee. Therefore, it would take her approximately 17400 / 500 = 34.8 hours to drink all those cups of coffee.
Response:  The first day, she drank 312 ml of water and 4 ml of alcohol, so in total she consumed 312 + 4 = 316 ml of liquid. Since there are 1000 ml in a liter, we can convert this amount to liters as follows: 316 ml / 1000 = 0.316 liters. Therefore, during the first day, she consumed 0.316 liters of alcohol.
"Response:  If Dembi drinks 6 cups of water per day, and she wants to collectively drink 12 cups of water over time, then we need to calculate how many days it will take her to reach that goal. To do this, we can divide the total amount of water (12 cups) by the daily amount of water she drinks (6 cups):

Days = Total amount of water / Daily amount of water

Days = 12 cups / 6 cups

Days = 2

Therefore, if Dembi continues to drink 6 cups of water per day, it will take her 2 days to collectively drink 12 cups of water."
"Response:  If she drank 15 cups of water and 54 cups of tea in one day, then we can calculate how many hours she spent drinking them as follows:

Water: 15 cups x 8 oz/cup = 120 oz (or 3.6 liters)
Tea: 54 cups x 8 oz/cup = 432 oz (or 12.7 liters)
Total amount drunk per day = Water + Tea = 3.6 liters + 12.7 liters = 16.3 liters
Now, let's convert this to hours:
Hours = Total amount drunk / Rate of consumption (in oz/hour)
Rate of consumption for water = 120 oz / 8 hours = 15 oz/hour
Rate of consumption for tea = 432 oz / 8 hours = 54 oz/hour
So, the person consumed 15 oz/hour of water and 54 oz/hour of tea throughout the day."
"Response:  The Debris Aggregate had 360 cubic meters of debris and 162 cubic meters of water when it was in overflow. If it received 122 cubic meters of water and 9 cubic meters of debris that day, how many hours would it take to fill the debris aggregate with water?  
Answer: To find out how many hours it would take to fill the debris aggregate with water, we need to divide the volume of water received (122 cubic meters) by the capacity of the debris aggregate (360 cubic meters). This gives us a ratio of 122/360 = 0.345 or approximately 34.5%. So, if it took 34.5% of the time to fill the debris aggregate with water, it would take approximately 34.5 / 100 = 0.345 days or 27.8 hours to fill the debris aggregate with water."
Response:  Since there are 14 series with 11 mollies in each series, we can calculate the total number of mollies as follows: Total Number of Mollies = Number of Series x Number of Mollies per Series Total Number of Mollies = 14 x 11 = 154 mollies Therefore, the correct answer is 154 mollies.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 moles of ice and we want to find out how many moles were in each series. So let's assume that the number of moles in each series is equal to the total number of moles divided by the number of series. Therefore, if we have 12 moles of ice and 3 series, then the number of moles in each series is:

$$ \frac{12}{3} = 4 $$
So, there were 4 moles of ice in each series."
Response:  Since there are 16 molybiums in each series and 28 packets of molybium, we can make at most $28 \div 16 = 1$ series with $24$ molybiums per series. Therefore, the number of possible series is $1$.
Response:  We know that there are 22 molybiums in total and each series has 14 molybiums. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of molybiums = Number of series x Number of molybiums per series Therefore, the total number of molybiums is : 22 = 6 x 14  So, there are 88 molybiums in total (6 x 14).
Response:  If she has 35 molybiums and 7 bogs, we know that each series will have 5 molybiums. So, to find out how many series she can make, we need to divide the total number of molybiums by 5: 35 / 5 = 7. Therefore, she can make 7 series with 5 molybiums in each series.
"Response:  Since there are 19 series with 4 molybiums and 27 bamboos in each series, we have:
Number of molybiums = Number of series x Number of molybiums per series
= 19 x 4
= 76 molybiums
Therefore, there are 76 molybiums in total."
Response:  We know that there are 7 series with 36 molybiums and 30 bamboos in each series. So, we can calculate the total number of molybiums as follows: Total number of molybiums = Number of series x Number of molybiums per series = 7 x 36 = 252 molybiums Therefore, the answer is 252 molybiums.
Response:  The Feast has served 11 courses with 31 molives and 27 bamboo shoots in each course. So, in total...
Response:  Since she has 30 molybiums to distribute among 5 series with 5 molybiums in each series, we can calculate the number of series as follows: Number of series = Total amount of molybiums / Number of molybiums per series = 30 / 5 = 6 Series So, she could have created 6 different series with 5 molybiums each.
Response:  If Fei had 6 molybiums and she threw them in two series, then she threw 3 molybiums in each series. So, in total, Fei threw 6 x 2 = 12 molybiums.
Response:  Since there are 35 molybiums and each series has 2 molybiums, we can make at most 17 different series. So, the number of possible sequences is 17.
Response:  The Fei had 31 packets of molybium, each containing 6 molybiums. She divided them into series with 19 molybiums in each series. So, how many molybiums does she have? We can calculate this as follows: Number of molybiums = Total number of packets x Number of molybiums per packet = 31 x 6 = 186 molybiums Therefore, the Fei has 186 molybiums.
Response:  The first series has 71 molybiums and 24 more in each subsequent series for a total of 30 series. So, the number of molybiums is: 71 + (24 x 30) = 2560 molybiums.
"Response:  Since there are 16 series with 6 molybiums and 21 molybiums in each series, we have:
Number of molybiums = Number of series x Number of molybiums per series
= 16 x 6 + 16 x 21
= 96 + 356
= 452 molybiums
Therefore, there are 452 molybiums in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students attending it. Since each classroom has multiple desks (not specified how many), we can assume that at least one classroom will have more than one student per desk. So, let's calculate the minimum number of desks needed for all classrooms:

Classrooms x Desks/classroom = Minimum number of desks
21 x (at least 1) = 21

Now, we need to add the number of desks in each classroom to get the total number of desks available in the school:
Total number of desks = Number of desks in each classroom x Total number of classrooms
21 x 7 = 147

So, there are at least 147 desks available in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 students who attend it. Since each student has one teacher, we can assume that there is at least one teacher per classroom (since some classes may have more than one teacher). Therefore, the number of teachers in the school is at least equal to the number of classrooms divided by the number of students. So, the number of teachers in the school is:

Number of teachers = Number of classrooms / Number of students
= 84 / 95
= 0.87 or approximately 1 teacher for every 1.1 classrooms.
Therefore, there are approximately 1 teacher for every 1.1 classrooms in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and 66 students in each grade level, for a total of 402 students in the school (67 x 6 = 402). Since there are 6 grades in total, we can calculate the number of students per grade as follows: Grade 1: 66/6 = 11 students Grade 2: 66/6 = 11 students Grade 3: 66/6 = 11 students Grade 4: 66/6 = 11 students Grade 5: 66/6 = 11 students Grade 6: 66/6 = 11 students Therefore, there are 11 students per grade level, or a total of 402 students in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students in each class. Therefore, we need to calculate how many classes there are in total:

Number of classes = Number of classrooms / Number of students per classroom
= 87 / 58
= 1.5

So, there are 1.5 classes in total. Since there are 2 positions available for each class, we can conclude that there are 3 total positions available for the entire school (2 x 1.5 = 3)."
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and 120 students attending it. Since each classroom has an equal number of students (as stated in the problem), we can assume that each classroom has 5 students (since 120 / 24 = 5). Therefore, there are 5 x 8 = 40 students in each grade level ( since there are 8 grades levels as mentioned in the problem). So, the total number of students in each grade level is 40.  Thus, the number of students in each grade level is 40.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and 8 places available per class trip. If 22 students do not want to go on the trip, then we need $ \frac {22}{8} = 3$ additional buses for them to travel separately. Therefore, the answer is $ 3 $.
Response:  If there are 11 students in total and 8 of them do not want to go on the trip, then the number of students who will go on the trip is: Number of students who will go on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students who do not want to go on the trip = 11 - 8 = 3.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and 3 classrooms per building. Therefore, we have: Number of buildings = 72 / 3 = 24 buildings. Since there are 111 students in total, we need: Number of trips per student = Total number of students / Number of students per trip = 111 / 3 = 37 trips per student. So, in total, we need: Number of trips = Number of students x Number of trips per student = 111 x 37 = 3971 trips.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms in the school and 46 school buses. Since each bus can carry a certain number of students (which we will call x), we have: Number of students = Total number of seats on all buses x Number of buses = 46 So, if we want to find out how many students can fit in each bus, we divide the total number of students by the number of buses: Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 92 / 46 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 students per bus.
"Response:  If Hiley gives 9 balls to each of the 11 children, and there are 11 children in total, then the number of balls given by Hiley is:

9 x 11 = 99 balls
So, Hiley gave 99 balls in total."
Response:  If Hili has 10 balls and gives 5 to each of the kids, then she gave a total of 5 x 5 = 25 balls. So, the answer is 25.
Response:  If Hili has 23 balls and wants to keep 15 for herself, how many will she have left? So, she will have 8 balls left (23 - 15 = 8).
Response:  There are 13 boys and 50 girls in total. If Hili has 26 balls to distribute among them, then each boy will get 2/3 of a ball (since there are 13/80 = 0.157 balls per boy), and each girl will get 1/4 of a ball (since there are 50/80 = 0.625 balls per girl). Therefore, Hili will give out 2/3 x 13 = 9 balls to the boys and 50/4 = 12.5 balls to the girls. So, Hili will have 26 - 9 - 12.5 = 4.5 balls left.
Response:  If Héilí has 20 balls and she wants to share them equally among her two classes of students, each class will get 10 balls (since 20 / 2 = 10). So, each student in the first class will get 5 balls ( since 10 / 2 = 5), and each student in the second class will also get 5 balls (since 10 / 2 = 5 again). Therefore, if Héilí shares her 20 balls equally among her two classes of students, each student will receive 5 balls.
"Response:  If there are n ball boys in total and Hili gives 2 balls to each boy, then the number of balls given by Hili is:

$$ \text {Number of balls given by Hili} = 2 \times n $$

Since there are 28 balls in total, we can substitute this value into the equation above:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of ball boys}} = 28 $$

So, there are 14 ball boys (since $n = 14$)."
Response:  We know that Frank read 14 pages of his favorite book today. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we need to divide the number of pages in the book (392) by the number of pages he reads per day (14). So, the answer is:  Frank will finish the book in 27 days (392 / 14 = 27).
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages of his favorite book every day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. So, we can calculate the total number of pages he read as follows: Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day Total pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Total pages = 12,388 pages Now, let's check if our calculation is correct. According to the question, the book has 400 pages in total. So, we can divide the total number of pages Frank read by the total number of pages in the book to get the percentage he read: Percentage = Total pages read / Total pages in the book Percentage = 12,388 pages / 400 pages = 30.95% Therefore, Frank read approximately 30.95% of the book.
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 6 days and the book has 612 pages, divided into 24 chapters. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages is 612, and Frank took 6 days to read the book, so we can plug these values into the formula like this: Number of pages read per day = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day Now, we want to find out how many pages Frank read in one day. To do this, we divide the number of pages read per day by 24, since there are 24 hours in a day: Number of pages read in one day = Number of pages read per day / 24 = 102 / 24 = 4.3 pages per hour Finally, we want to convert this value from pages per hour to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can multiply the value by 60: Number of pages read in one day (in minutes) = Number of pages read in one hour x 60 = 4.3 x 60 = 258 minutes So, based on the information provided in the question, Frank read approximately 258 minutes worth of pages in one day.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 220 minutes to complete it. Since there are 5 chapters in the book, each chapter has 45 pages (220/5 = 45). So, each chapter contains 45 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is 45.
Response:  We know that Frank read 193 pages of his favorite book and there are 15 chapters in total. Since he spent 660 minutes reading it, we can calculate how many minutes he spent reading each chapter as follows: Minutes per chapter = Total time taken to read the book / Number of chapters = 660 minutes / 15 chapters = 44 minutes per chapter Now, let's find out how many chapters Frank read that day: Chapters read that day = Time taken to read one chapter x Number of chapters = 44 minutes/chapter x 15 chapters = 660 minutes So, Frank read 660 minutes or 10 hours and 40 minutes that day.
Response:  The book had 249 pages and Frank read three parts of it. So, he read 249 x 3 = 747 pages that day.
Response:  If Frank read each book for 12 pages and there were 66 pages in each book, then he read a total of 784 pages (66 x 12 = 784). So, if he had 492 parts to complete all the books, that means he completed 492 / 784 = 0.63 or approximately 63% of the books.
Response:  We know that Frank read 16 parts of the book and it took him 1 day to finish reading it. So, he read 1/16 of the book per day. Since there are 112 pages in the book, we can calculate how many days it would take to read the entire book as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day Therefore, the answer is: Number of days = 112 pages / 16 pages per day = 7 days
Response:  If Frank read 8 pages of his beloved book per day, and the book has 576 pages in total, then we can calculate how many days it took him to finish reading the book as follows: Time taken = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day Time taken = 576 / 8 Time taken = 72 days So, Frank took 72 days to finish reading his beloved book.
Response:  We know that Frank read 41 chapters out of 450 pages in his favorite book. Since he took 30 days to finish reading it, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book Time taken to read the book = 30 days x 24 hours/day = 720 hours Total number of pages = 450 pages Now, let's convert the time from hours to minutes: Minutes = Hours x 60 Minutes = 720 hours x 60 = 43,200 minutes Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of minutes spent reading: Pages read per minute = Total number of pages / Number of minutes spent reading Pages read per minute = 450 pages / 43,200 minutes = 10.2 pages per minute Therefore, Frank read approximately 10.2 pages per minute during the 30 days he took to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book and it had three chapters with each chapter containing 594 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Chapter 1 = 3 x 594 = 1782 pages Chapter 2 = 3 x 594 = 1782 pages Chapter 3 = 3 x 594 = 1782 pages Total number of pages in the book = 1782 + 1782 + 1782 = 5358 pages Now, we are asked how many minutes Frank spent reading the book. Since there are 607 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours as follows: 607 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 10.12 hours So, Frank spent 10 hours and 12 minutes reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read the book he loved and that it had two chapters with 405 pages each. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages Frank read in one day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book In this case, the total number of pages is 810 (2 x 405), and the number of days taken to finish the book is 664 hours. So, the number of pages Frank read in one day is: Number of pages read per day = 810 / 664 = 1.25 pages per day
Response:  We know that there are 6 DVDs in total and each one costs $20. So, we can calculate the cost of each DVD as follows: Cost per DVD = Total cost / Number of DVDs = $120 / 6 = $20 per DVD Therefore, each DVD costs $20.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then the cost of 33 packages would be:

$81 x 33 = $2693

So, the total cost of 33 packages of DVDs would be $2693."
Response:  If each DVD costs $107, then the total cost of n DVDs is given by: C = n x $107 So if there is a discount of $106 for each DVD, the new price per DVD is: P = C / (1 - d) = ($107 / (1 - 0.93)) = $95.28 Therefore, you can buy n DVDs at a price of $95.28 each if the original price was $107 each and there is a discount of $106 for each DVD.
"Response:  If each DVD costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 for each DVD, then we need to find out how much money we need to pay for each DVD after applying the discount. So, the cost of each DVD = $76 - ($25 x number of DVDs) We can plug in the value of ""number of DVDs"" (x) from the question into this formula: Cost of each DVD = $76 - ($25 x x) Now, we substitute the value of x from the question: Cost of each DVD = $76 - ($25 x 4) = $76 - $100 = -$24 Therefore, you would have to pay -$24 for each DVD if there is a discount of $25 for each DVD."
"Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...

You can afford to buy:
$104 / $26 = 4 DVDs
So, you can buy 4 DVDs with your $104."
Response:  We have $28 to spend and we want to buy two DVD packs. So, the total cost of both packs is $28 / 2 = $14 per pack. Therefore, each pack costs $14.
"Response:  We have 18 balls in total and we want to divide them into teams of size 2. How many teams can we create?

To solve this problem, we need to use division. Division is a mathematical operation that divides a number (dividend) by another number (divisor). In this case, we are dividing 18 balls by 2 to find out how many teams we can create.

So, if we divide 18 by 2, we get:

18 ÷ 2 = 9

This means that we can create 9 teams of size 2 with the 18 balls available."
"Response:  We know that there are 140 teams in total and each team has 18 players (or 187 if we consider the possibility of some teams having more than one player per position). So, the number of basketball players in Philip's collection is:

$$ \text {Number of basketball players} = \frac{140}{18} = 770 $$

Therefore, Philip has approximately $770$ basketball players in his collection."
Response:  If there are 203 panes and 63 portocali in Philip's collection, then we have to divide them into smaller groups of pane and portocali accordingly.  Since there are 7 omadas of pane and 95 omadas of portocali, we can calculate the number of each type of item in each omada as follows:  Number of pane in each omada = Total number of pane / Number of omadas of pane = 203 / 7 = 29 Panes per omada  Number of portocali in each omada = Total number of portocali / Number of omadas of portocali = 63 / 95 = 0.66 Portocali per omada Now, let's check how many pane or portocali are in each omada: Omada 1 has 29 pane, which means it has 0 portocali (since 0.66 x 29 = 18)...
Response:  If there are 142 panes and 356 portocali in Philip's collection, then the number of portocali per omada is: Number of portocali / Total number of portocali = 178 / 504 = 0.355 or approximately 35.5%. Therefore, each omada has approximately 35.5 portocali.
"Response:  Since there are 196 teams in total, and each team has 3 players, we have:
Number of players = Number of teams x Number of players per team
= 196 x 3
= 588 players
So, if there are 392 bananas in total, the number of bananas per player is:
Number of bananas per player = Total number of bananas / Number of players
= 392 / 588
= 0.67 bananas per player"
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in total in Philip's collection. If we divide this number by 18, we get the number of groups of bananas: $ \frac{18}{18} = 1$ group. Therefore, there is one group of bananas in Philip's collection.
Response:  We have 87 portocals and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If we organize the bananas into 2 teams of equal size, each team will contain how many bananas?  To find out, we can divide the total number of bananas (290) by 2, which gives us 145 bananas per team. Therefore, if we organize the bananas into 2 teams, each team will contain 145 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 porcelain pieces and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we organize the bananas into 345 groups of equal size (either 1, 2, or 3 bananas per group), then each group will contain 345/3 = 115 bananas. Therefore, each group of bananas contains 115 bananas. Now, let's consider the porcelain pieces. Since there are 16 groups of porcelain pieces, each group must contain 16 x 115 = 1840 porcelain pieces. So, each group of porcelain pieces contains 1840 pieces. In conclusion, each group of bananas contains 115 bananas, and each group of porcelain pieces contains 1840 pieces.
Response:  The mother of Brent made 38 baskets for the guests. Each basket had 19 biscuits inside. Therefore, the total number of biscuits in all 38 baskets is:  38 x 19 = 726 biscuits
Response:  The mother of Brent made 14 baskets for 14 people. If each person had 30 baskets, how many baskets did the mother make in total?  So, the answer is 14 x 30 = 420 baskets.
Response:  The mother of Brent made 22 biscuits but ended up eating 17. If each person had the same number of biscuits as the mother, then how many did they have? We can start by using the information that there were 5 people in total (including the mother). So, if the mother had x biscuits, then each person had x/5 biscuits. Since the mother had 22 biscuits, we know that x = 22. Therefore, each person had 22/5 = 4.4 biscuits.
Response:  The mother of Brent made 18 biscuits and gave them to 10 guests, but only 9 came. If each guest received an equal number of biscuits, how many did each person receive? Solution: We know that the total number of biscuits given to all guests is 18, and there were 10 guests in total. So, if we divide the total number of biscuits by the number of guests who came (9), we get the average number of biscuits each guest received: 18 / 9 = 2 biscuits per guest.
Response:  The mother of Brent made 14 pizzas for 2 guests. If each guest had the same number of slices as the other guest, then... (continue)
Response:  The mother of Brent made biscuits for the guests. Each guest had two biscuits. If she made a total of 10 biscuits for how many guests did she make them?
Response:  Frank has 42 marbles and wants to divide them equally between two sacks. Since there are 7 marbles in each sack, we can write an equation: 42 = 7x + 7 where x is the number of marbles that will be in one sack. Now we solve for x: x = 42 / 7 = 6 So, there will be 6 marbles in each sack.
Response:  Since Frank had many sweet peppers, let's assume he had 26 x 33 = 849 sweet peppers in total. So, the number of caramel candies Frank had is 849 - 26 = 823.
Response:  Frank had 33 marbles and lost 24 of them. If he distributed the remaining marbles equally among 9 sacks with each sack containing 4 marbles, how many sacks would he have? So, the number of sacks = Total number of marbles / Number of marbles in each sack = 33 / 4 = 8 sacks.
"Response:  If Frank threw 11 glykia into each sack, and he had 22 sacks in total, then the number of glykia he threw into all the sacks is:

11 x 22 = 242 glykia
Therefore, if Frank had 22 sacks, he would have thrown 242 glykia in total."
Response:  Frank threw some caramel candies into two bags. If he had 16 glykia (a unit of measurement for candy), how many glykia would each bag have? We know that Frank divided the candies equally between the two bags, so each bag has half of the total number of candies. Therefore, if one bag has x glykia, the other bag also has x glykia. Now we can set up an equation based on the information given in the question:  Number of glykia in each bag = Total number of glykia / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 glykia per bag. So, each bag contains 8 glykia.
Response:  We know that Sirley has sold 25 kibbles and each kibble contains 14 pieces of triphyllian. So, we need to find out how many triphyllians Sirley needs to sell in total. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total number of triphyllians = Number of kibbles x Number of pieces per kibble Therefore, the total number of triphyllians needed is: Total number of triphyllians = 25 x 14 = 350 triphyllians.
Response:  The Sirley has 10 triangles and each triangle has 3 sides. So, in total, she has 10 x 3 = 30 sides. Now, she needs to give away 5 sides. Therefore, the number of sides that each basket will have is 30 / 5 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 67 baskets of canned goods and 9 baskets of damaged goods. To find out how many more baskets of canned goods than damaged goods, we need to subtract the number of damaged baskets from the total number of baskets. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  67 - 9 = 58. Therefore, there were 58 more baskets of canned goods than damaged goods.
Response:  The total number of books in the store is 83 (22 + 61). To find out how many more books were over the recommended amount for each category, we need to subtract the number of books that are recommended from the total number of books. For the canonic books, the recommendation is 22, so we subtract this number from the total: 83 - 22 = 61. Now, let's do the same thing for the excessive books: 61 - 61 = 0. So, there were no excessive books in this case.
Response:  The panoply had 30 simple sandals, 8 sandals of luxury, and 41 melons. In total, they had 79 sandals (30 + 8 + 41).
Response:  We know that there are 79 baskets of canned goods and 53 baskets of food waste. So, we have to find out how many more baskets of canned goods than food waste. To do this, we need to subtract the number of baskets of food waste from the total number of baskets of canned goods. Therefore, the answer is: 79 - 53 = 26 baskets of canned goods more than food waste.
Response:  The total number of books in the store is given as 54 + 83 = 137. Since there are 12 melons, we can subtract their count from the total to get the number of bookshelves with more than 83 books: 137 - 12 = 125. Therefore, 125 bookshelves had more than 83 books each.
Response:  The panoply had 17 puppies in total, of which 9 were born naturally and 8 were artificially bred. They also had 29 cats. How many litters did they breed? To find this out, we need to divide the number of natural births (9) by the average litter size for dogs (5-6), since all the artificially bred puppies are assumed to be from one female. So, the number of litters is: 9 / 5 = 1.8 liters. Therefore, they bred 1.8 liters of diarrhea.
Response:  The panoply had 19 shoes of excessive debt and 60 shoes of conventional debt. To find out how many shoes of conventional debt had more than the debt excess, we need to subtract the number of shoes of excessive debt from the total number of shoes. So, the answer is: 60 - 19 = 41 shoes of conventional debt that had more than the debt excess.
Response:  The store had 72 cans of soda, which is equal to 72 x 16 = 1152 ounces. Then, it had 32 cups of soda, which is equal to 32 / 8 = 4 cups. Finally, it had 78 apples. So, the number of cans above the apple is: 1152 - 4 = 1148.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 melons and 80 baskets of fruit in total.  Since each basket contains 12 fruits (melons or other types), we can calculate the number of melons as follows:

Number of melons = Total number of fruits / Number of baskets per melon
= 36 + 80 - 54
= 12

So, there were 12 melons above the ground."
Response:  We know that out of 30 puppies, 28 were in good health and only 2 were sick. So, we can say that 2 x 28 = 56 puppies were in good health. Therefore, 56 - 2 = 54 puppies had no disease.
"Response:  If they had 4 pantopoles of excessive debt and if their total debt was 79 times greater than their income, then we can calculate how many pantopoles of excessive debt they had as follows:

Total Debt = Income x Number of Pantopoles of Excessive Debt

We know that the number of pantopoles of excessive debt is 4, so let's substitute this value into the equation above:

Total Debt = Income x 4

Now, we need to find out what the income of the person or people in question was. Unfortunately, the question doesn't provide any information about the income level of the individuals involved. However, we can assume that the income level was reasonable enough for them to have been able to accumulate $79 worth of debt relative to their income.

Assuming an average annual income of $50,000 (which is roughly the median household income in the United States), we can estimate the total debt as follows:

Total Debt = $50,000 x 4 = $200,000

So, based on our calculations, the person or people in question had approximately 4 pantopoles of excessive debt."
Response:  The panoply had 57 cannons and 26 guns. So far so good! But then it says that they also had 27 swords. Now we have a problem because earlier it said that there were 57 cannons and 26 guns, which means that the total number of weapons is 83 (57 + 26). However, now it says that there are 27 swords, which means that the total number of weapons is actually 109 (83 + 27). So, to summarize, the panoply had 109 weapons in total.
Response:  The total number of books in the store is 81. Of these, 60 are fiction and 21 are non-fiction. So, the number of fiction books that have more than 60 pages is 60 - 21 = 39. Therefore, there were 39 fiction books with more than 60 pages in the store.
Response:  The store had 49 baskets of canned goods, and 40 baskets of food products. So, in total, they had 89 baskets (49 + 40). Now, we need to find out how many baskets were simple and how many were discounted. From the information given, we know that there were 6 baskets of discounted items. Therefore, the number of simple baskets is equal to 83 (89 - 6), which means that 83 baskets were simple and 6 were discounted.
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to the palace of Mr. Bakigiannis that day, and 295 of them arrived earlier in the day, then we can calculate how many more visitors came later as follows: Number of additional visitors = Total number of visitors - Number of early arrivals = 317 - 295 = 22 Therefore, 22 more visitors came later than the previous day.
Response:  If there were 703 visitors in total and 246 of them visited the palace that day, then we can calculate how many people visited each part of the palace as follows: Number of visitors per part = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors that day So, if we divide the total number of visitors (703) by the number of visitors that came that day (246), we get: Number of visitors per part = 703 / 246 = 2.81 people per part Now, since we want to know how many parts the palace has, let's assume that it has 25 parts. Therefore, the number of people who visited each part of the palace is: Number of people per part = 2.81 x 25 = 70.25 people So, according to the information provided, 70.25 people visited each part of the palace that day.
Response:  If there were 100 visitors before and 666 additional visitors came that day, then the total number of visitors to Mr. Bakigiam's palace that day would be: 100 + 666 = 766 visitors.
Response:  We know that after a lavish feast, 132 guests came to Bakigkham's palace. Reitzel learned that 406 people visited Bakigkham's palace that day. If 406 people visited the palace during the last 327 minutes, how many people visited the palace earlier in the day?
Response:  We know that after a lavish feast, Reese learned that 45 guests had arrived at Bakigcham's palace earlier in the day. If 829 people visited Bakigcham's palace during the last 85 minutes, how many visitors did he have in total?  To find out, we need to divide the number of visitors who came later (829) by the time they spent there (85 minutes). So, the total number of visitors is:  Number of visitors = Total time / Time spent per visitor  Number of visitors = 829 / 0.67 hours (since each minute is equal to 0.67 hours)  Number of visitors = 1253 people  Therefore, if 829 people visited Bakigcham's palace during the last 85 minutes, then a total of 1253 people visited his palace that day.
Response:  We know that after a lavish feast, they went to see Bakigkham's palace. There were 71 boxes in the palace of Bakigkham. Reitzel learned that 557 visitors had come to the palace that day. If there were 188 visitors earlier in the day, how many people visited the palace during 57 sessions?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of visitors (557) by the number of sessions (57). So, the answer is: 557 / 57 = 9.6
Response:  We know that after a heavy meal, they went to see Bakigkham's palace and found 39 boxes inside. Reitzel learned that 661 visitors had come to the palace that day. If there were 600 visitors earlier in the day, how many more visitors came to the palace later that day?
Response:  We know that after a lavish feast, 92 guests came to Bakigkham's palace. According to Reitsel, there were 419 guests in total before that day and 103 guests in total before that day. So, if we subtract the number of guests who came later (92) from the total number of guests before that day (419), we get 327. Therefore, 327 people visited Bakigkham's palace before that day.
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to the palace of Mr. Bakigkham that day and Reeta learned that 471 visitors had arrived earlier in the day, then the total number of visitors to the palace that day is:  Total Number of Visitors = 512 - 471 = 41 visitors.  And if there were 808 visitors later in the day, then the total number of visitors to the palace over the last 89 minutes is:  Total Number of Visitors Over Last 89 Minutes = 808 - 41 = 767 visitors.
"Response:  If there were 705 visitors to the palace of Mr. Bakigiannis that day and 191 visitors in the previous hour, then the number of visitors during the previous 245 hours would be:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors x Number of hours since last visit
= 705 x (245 - 191)
= 705 x 54
= 38,675
Therefore, there were approximately 38,675 visitors to the palace of Mr. Bakigiannis over the previous 245 hours."
Response:  We have 159 feathers to glue onto the next wing. If each feather requires 628 grams of glue, how many grams of glue do we already have? So, we need 469 grams more glue (628 - 159 = 469).
"Response:  We know that we need to paint 49 colors for the flowers and leaves, so let's assume that each color requires 10 grams of paint (this is just an estimate). Therefore, we will need a total of:

49 x 10 = 490 grams of paint for the flowers and leaves.

Now, let's calculate how much paint is left after painting the flowers and leaves. If we have 260 grams of paint left, and we used 490 grams for the flowers and leaves, then we can deduce that:

260 - 490 = -230 grams of paint are left.

So, there are -230 grams of paint left."
Response:  We know that we need 57 grams of color for painting and 22 grams of brushes. So, in total, we need 57 + 22 = 79 grams of materials to paint one tree. Therefore, if we want to paint n trees, we will need a total of 79 x n grams of materials.
Response:  We know that the next number in the list is the one for Kerry to collide with the birds. So, we need to find out how many more grams of sugar are needed to make 166 grams of sugar + 20 grams of sugar =? grams of sugar. To do this, we can use simple arithmetic. If we have 166 grams of sugar and add 20 grams of sugar, we get 186 grams of sugar. Therefore, the remaining amount of sugar required is 166 - 186 = 20 grams of sugar.
"Response:  If he has 557 feathers and needs only 17 more to complete his collection, then we can calculate how many feathers he already has as follows:

Number of feathers he already has = Total number of feathers - Number of feathers needed
= 557 - 17
= 540

So, he already has 540 feathers."
"Response:  If there are 11 feathers and each feather requires 492 keratin strands to be collapsed, then we need in total:

11 feathers x 492 keratin strands per feather = 5,302 keratin strands

So, we need an additional 5,302 keratin strands beyond the initial 11 feathers."
"Response:  The text says that they had 94 collectors who collected 90 barrels of wine in 6 days. So, we can calculate how many barrels each collector collected per day as follows: Number of barrels per day = Total number of barrels / Number of collectors x Number of days To find out how many barrels one collector collected per day, we need to divide the total number of barrels by the number of collectors and multiply it by the number of days. In this case, if we divide 90 barrels by 94 collectors, we get approximately 0.95 barrels per collector per day (rounded to the nearest whole number). Now, let's convert this amount into liters: Number of liters = Volume of a barrel x Number of barrels per day Where ""Volume of a barrel"" is equal to 160 liters (approximately), since a barrel is roughly equivalent to 160 liters. Therefore, if we multiply 0.95 barrels per collector per day by 160 liters per barrel, we get approximately 148 liters per collector per day (again rounded to the nearest whole number). So, in summary, based on the information provided in the question, each collector collected approximately 148 liters of wine per day."
Response:  If they had 266 collectors and each one collected 90 barrels in 5 days, then we can calculate how many barrels were collected overall as follows: Number of barrels = Total number of collectors x Amount of barrels collected per collector Total number of barrels = 266 x 90 = 23,840 barrels So, in total, 23,840 barrels of oil were collected.
Response:  We know that there are 294 collectors and they collected 244 barrels of wine per day. So, we have to divide this number by 294 collectors: 244/294 = 0.83 barrels per collector per day. Now, let's consider how many barrels each part will contain. If we take into account that there are 146 parts in total, then we can calculate how many barrels each part will contain: 0.83 barrels / 146 parts = 0.57 barrels per part. Therefore, 146 parts will contain approximately 0.57 barrels of wine each.
Response:  We know that there are 235 thespians who can make 100 barrels of bat's blood per day and 221 barrels of grape juice per day. To find out how many barrels of grape juice will be produced in total, we need to multiply the number of thespians by the amount they can produce per day: 235 x 221 = 50,955 barrels of grape juice per day. Now, let's calculate how many barrels of grape juice will be produced in 77 parts: 50,955 / 77 = 648 barrels of grape juice per part. Therefore, 77 parts will produce 648 barrels of grape juice in total.
Response:  The lovely man had to check the barrels after 57 stages. They said he had collected 252 syllables that could fill 108 barrels of water during the day. How many barrels of water would 58 parts fill?
Response:  If they had 36 syllables to express how much they loved him and they used all of them to say that they would have filled 8 barrels with water that day, then... We know that one barrel can hold 40 gallons (or 151 liters) of water. So, if they wanted to fill 240 barrels with water, it would take... 240 / 40 = 6 days.
Response:  Since there are 26 enydes and each enyde has 52 aquatic animals in total, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of aquatic animals = Total number of enydes x Number of aquatic animals per enyde So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of aquatic animals = 26 x 52 = 1320 aquatic animals Therefore, each enyde has 1320 aquatic animals.
Response:  We know that there were 40 fish in total and each enclosure had 2 fish inside it. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of enclosures = Total number of fish / Number of fish per enclosure. In this case, the total number of fish is 40, and the number of fish per enclosure is 2. Therefore, we can solve for the number of enclosures as follows: Number of enclosures = 40 / 2 = 20 enclosures.
Response:  The total number of animals in all enclosures is given as 56 + 10 = 66. Since each enclosure has at least 39 animals (as that's the minimum number for each enclosure), the total number of animals in all enclosures is therefore 66 x 39 = 2744. So, Tailer has 2744 animals in his aquarium.
Response:  The total number of fish in all tanks is given as 108 (74 for glucobrata and 22 for almyra). Since each tank has 46 creatures inside it, we can calculate the total number of creatures in all tanks as follows: Total number of creatures = Number of tanks x Number of creatures per tank = 108 x 46 = 4932 creatures. Therefore, Tailer has 4932 creatures of almryu nero in his aquarium.
Response:  The first enclosure has 15 water animals and 62 gliders. Each enclosure has 19 animals inside it. So, in total... there are 15 x 19 = 285 water animals and 62 x 19 = 1140 gliders. Therefore, the total number of animals is 285 + 1140 = 1425 animals.
Response:  If there are 13 white mice in total and Mrs. White buys 39 of them, then she will have bought 39 / 13 = 3 packages of mice.
Response:  If Mamá has bought 66 white marbles and each package contains 3 white marbles, then we can calculate the number of packages as follows: Number of packages = Total number of marbles / Number of marbles in each package = 66 / 3 = 22 packages So, Mamá will have 22 packages of marbles.
Response:  If Mamá has bought 28 packages of white blouses that contain 56 white blouses in total, then each package contains  __________ white blouses.
Response:  If the grandmother has bought 53 packs of white blouses and each pack contains 6 blouses, then she has in total 53 x 6 = 318 white blouses. Now, if she also buys 34 panels, which are not counted among the 53 packs, then she will have an additional 34 white blouses. Therefore, the final number of white blouses that the grandmother will have is 318 + 34 = 352 white blouses.
Response:  The mama has 51 white marbles and wants to package them in bags of 3 each. To find out how many bags she can make, we need to divide the total number of marbles by 3. So, the answer is:  Number of bags = Total number of marbles / Number of marbles per bag = 51 / 3 = 17 bags
Response:  The mama buys 70 white blouses altogether. If each pack contains x blouses, then the number of blouses in each pack is 70/x. Since the mama buys 14 packs, the total number of blouses she has is 14 x (number of blouses in each pack). Therefore, the answer is 14x.
Response:  We have 4 sakulas with the same number of baskets as each other (let's call it x). So, we have 4x baskets in total from all 4 sakulas combined. Now, there are 36 baskets in total. Therefore, the number of baskets per sakula is:  Number of baskets / Total number of sakulas = 36 / 4 = 9. So, each sakula has 9 baskets.
"Response:  If you have 33 baskets and each basket contains 11 biscuits, then:

Number of biscuits = Total number of baskets x Number of biscuits in each basket
= 33 x 11
= 353 biscuits

Therefore, you have 353 biscuits."
"Response:  If every sack has 41 baskets and you have 53 sacks of baskets, then...

Answer:  You will have a total of 2091 baskets (41 x 53 = 2091)."
Response:  We have 14 baskets of apples and we want to know how many apples each sack has. Since there are 7 sacks in total, let's divide the number of apples among them: 14 / 7 = 2 apples per sack. So, each sack contains 2 apples.
Response:  If every sack has 3 baskets and you have 21 baskets in total, then: Number of sacks = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets per sack = 21 / 3 = 7 sacks. Therefore, you have 7 sacks.
Response:  We have 26 sacks of rice with an equal number of biscuits inside each sack. So, we have 26 x 15 = 390 biscuits in total. Now, we know that there are 52 bags of biscuits in total. Therefore, the number of biscuits in one bag is 52 / 26 = 2 biscuits per sack. So, the number of biscuits in each sack is 390 / 2 = 195 biscuits.
Response:  We have 14 sacks of beans with an equal number of bags of sugar. If we had 28 baskets and 86 kilograms of sugar in total, how many bags of sugar would each basket contain?  To find out, let's divide the total weight of sugar (in kg) by the number of baskets: 86 kg / 28 baskets = 3.07 kg per basket. So, if you had 14 sacks of beans with an equal number of bags of sugar, then you would have 14 x 3.07 kg/basket = 43.98 kg of sugar in total.
Response:  The taxi driver is asked to give 5 pieces of information about each house in a neighborhood. If he gives 25 letters for each house, then we can conclude that there are 25 houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  We have to divide 9 by 4 (the number of sides of a square) and then multiply it by the number of squares. So we get: 9 / 4 = 2.25. Since there are 20 squares in total, we need to divide 2.25 by 20 to find out how many commas each square should receive: 2.25 / 20 = 0.11. Therefore, each square should receive approximately 0.11 commas from unbiased reporting.
Response:  We have 6 houses in a square shape and we need to give 24 pieces of candy from each house. So, for each house, we will give 24/6 = 4 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies that the taxi driver needs to give is 4 x 6 = 24.
"Response:  The taxi driver gives 14 non-identical messages to each house in a square of length 4 houses. Since there are 16 houses in total (since each house receives 2 messages), we have:

Number of houses = 16

Now, since each message is either identical or non-identical, and there are 2 non-identical messages per house, we can say that the number of different pairs of houses that receive non-identical messages is:

Number of different pairs of houses = 2 x 15 = 30

So, there are 30 houses that receive non-identical messages from the taxi driver."
Response:  We have 20 houses in a square-shaped area with four sides of equal length (let's call it x). A taxi driver needs to deliver 32 packages to each house in each quadrant. So, we need to calculate how many packages the taxi driver needs to deliver to each quadrant. To do this, we can divide the total number of packages (32) by the number of houses in that quadrant (4):  Number of packages per quadrant = Total number of packages / Number of houses in that quadrant = 32 / 4 = 8 packages per quadrant. Therefore, the taxi driver needs to deliver 8 packages to each of the four quadrants, for a total of 32 packages delivered overall.
Response:  We have to divide 30 pieces of irrelevant writing among 19 houses in one quadrant. To do this, we need to find out how many pieces each house will get.  So, let's divide 30 by 19: 30 / 19 = 1.56 pieces per house. Therefore, each house will receive approximately 1.56 pieces of irrelevant writing.
"Response:  The taxi driver is asked to give 8 impressions of random lines from a pool of 55 quadrilaterals. If he gives 32 impressions in each house, how many houses are there in one quadrant?

Answer: There are 32 houses in one quadrant."
Response:  We have to divide 81 into 12 equal parts of 7 each (since there are 12 spits in total). So we need to give 7 x 12 = 84 pieces of wood from unused writing material for every 100 square meters. Therefore, if there are 81 houses in total and they cover an area of 100 square meters each, we will need 81 x 84 = 6,796 pieces of wood from unused writing material.
Response:  We have to divide 16 tetragons among 17 spiti. Each spiti has 4 compartments, so we need to distribute 16 / 17 = 0.94 tetragons per spiti. Since there are 4 compartments in each spiti, we need to divide 0.94 by 4 = 0.235 tetragons for each compartment. Therefore, the total number of tetragons that the taxi driver needs to give is 0.235 x 17 = 4.
Response:  We have 10 eggs and 20 balls. To make 4 teams of equal size, we need to divide them into groups such that each group has an equal number of members (in this case, 5 people). So, we will use 5 eggs for each team. Therefore, the number of teams that can be formed is: Number of teams = Total number of objects / Size of each team = 10 eggs / 5 eggs per team = 2 teams.
"Response:  We have 10 balls and 15 eggs to distribute among 5 teams. To find out how many eggs each team will get, we need to divide the total number of eggs (15) by the number of teams (5). So, each team will get:

$$ \frac{15}{5} = 3 $$

So, there will be 3 eggs per team."
Response:  If each team has 2 eggs and there are 11 teams in total, then the number of eggs Rempeka wants to distribute is:  Number of eggs = Total number of teams x Number of eggs per team = 11 x 2 = 22 eggs.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and 6 baskets. Each basket can hold at most 2 eggs (since we don't know if there are any other objects in the basket). So, we can distribute the eggs among the teams as follows: Team A gets 0 eggs since they already have 2 eggs from their basket. Teams B, C, D each get 1 egg from the remaining 6 - 3 = 3 eggs. Therefore, each of these teams will have 1 egg left over after distributing them equally among themselves. Now let's check how many eggs each team has: Team A has 0 eggs, so they have none. Teams B, C, D each have 1 egg left over, so they have 1 egg each. Thus, the final distribution is: Team A: 0 eggs, Teams B, C, D: 1 egg each.
Response:  We have 4 balls and 15 eggs. If we want to divide them equally among 3 teams, how many eggs will each team get?  To find out, let's divide 15 eggs by 3 teams: 15 / 3 = 5 eggs per team. So each team will get 5 eggs.
Response:  We have to divide the total number of eggs (18) among the teams of 6 people each. Since there are 6 teams in total, we need to divide 18 by 6 = 3. So, each team will get 3 eggs. Now, let's calculate how many baskets each team can make using these eggs. Each basket requires 72 bananas and 66 bolos. So, if a team gets 3 eggs, they can make 3 x 72 = 216 baskets with bananas and 3 x 66 = 198 baskets with bolos. Therefore, the answer is 414 baskets.
"Response:  We have 99 bananas and 27 balls. To divide them equally among three teams means that each team will get:

$$ \text{Number of bananas per team} = \frac{\text{Total number of bananas}}{3} $$

So, we have:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bananas per team}} = \frac{99}{3} = 33 } $$

Now, let's calculate how many balls each team will get:

$$ \text{Number of balls per team} = \frac{\text{Total number of balls}}{3} $$

So, we have:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of balls per team}} = \frac{27}{3} = 9 } $$

Therefore, there will be 3 teams with 33 bananas and 9 balls each."
Response:  The Rempeka wants to distribute 5 baskets of eggs among groups of 5 people each. The Rempeka has 20 eggs and 6 baskets. To find out how many eggs each basket will have, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of baskets: Number of eggs per basket = Total number of eggs / Number of baskets = 20 eggs / 6 baskets = 3.33 eggs per basket So, the Rempeka has 3 baskets of eggs.
Response:  The Rempeka wants to distribute 20 baskets of eggs among teams of 20 people. It has 5 balls and 12 eggs. So, it needs 6 more eggs to fill one basket. Therefore, the Rempeka has 6 eggs left after distributing all the eggs.
Response:  If Luke played a game and scored 154 points, he won 11 points in each quarter. So, if we divide 154 by 4 (the number of quarters), we get an average score per quarter of 38.5 points.
Response:  If Luke played 177 turns in a game of triples and won 46 points for each turn, then he scored a total of: 177 x 46 = 8320 points.
Response:  If Luke won 84 points after two turns of the wheel and he bet on red, then in each turn he won $16 (since there are 4 pockets on the wheel). So, in total, he won $32 (84/2 = 42). Now, if we assume that he bet on red in both turns, then he won $84 (42 x 2 = 84) for the entire game.
Response:  If Luke won 146 points in each turn of the game and he played 3 turns, then he won a total of 146 x 3 = 438 points. However, if he played 157 moves in one game of Triangles, then he scored 157 points. So, the difference between the two scores is 438 - 157 = 281 points.
Response:  If Luke won 3 points in each of the 4 rounds, he would have won a total of 12 points (3 x 4 = 12). Since he had 78 points at the beginning, he lost a total of 66 points (78 - 12 = 66) during the game. Therefore, he played 66 games.
Response:  Since Emily had 2 hands and wanted to make 32 cookies, she needed 16 cookies per hand. So, in total, she needed 2 x 16 = 32 cookies.
Response:  The Emily has 11 friends and each friend takes 28 candies. So, in total, how many candies does Emily have?  We can write an equation using this information: Number of candies = Total number of friends x Number of candies per friend  In this case, we know that the total number of friends is 11 and the number of candies per friend is 28. Plugging these values into the equation, we get: Number of candies = 11 x 28 = 308 candies Therefore, Emily has 308 candies.
"Response:  If each piece of candy takes 8 hands to make and Emily has 16 hands, then...

Answer:  Emily can make 4 pieces of candy (4 x 8 = 32)."
Response:  If Emily had 6 hands and she needed to make 18 cookies for her friends, then each hand would need to make 3 cookies (18 / 6 = 3). So, the answer is 3.
Response:  The Emily has 10 fingers (hands), and each finger can hold one chandy. So, she had 10 chandies in total. She gave 4 of them to her friends, which means she has 6 chandies left (10 - 4 = 6).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emili has 6 hands and each hand can hold 3 chains. So, in total, she has 6 x 3 = 18 chains she can hold at once. Now, let's consider how many chains she can make with her friends. Each friend of hers has 72 chains, which means they have 72 / 3 = 24 chains per hand. Since there are 7 friends in total, they can collectively hold 7 x 24 = 168 chains. Therefore, the total number of chains Emili can make with all her friends is 18 + 168 = 186 chains!
Response:  Since Emily had 5 hands and wanted to make 20 pies, she needed 4 hands for each pie (since there are 4 fingers in each hand). So, she needed a total of 16 hands (4 x 4 = 16) to make all 20 pies. Therefore, 16 hands were sufficient to make all the pies.
Response:  We know that Emili has 44 friends and she gave each of them 26 candies. Since each candy takes 2 hands to hold, we can calculate the number of hands needed as follows: Number of hands = Total number of candies / Number of candies per hand = 26 x 44 = 1152 hands So, Emili had 1152 hands in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lorraine who went to summer camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children stayed in summer camp than those who stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children who went to summer camp. So, the difference between these two numbers is:  819058 - 668278 = 150780. Therefore, 150780 more children stayed in summer camp than those who stayed at home.
"Response:  We know that out of 1043400 children from Lorraine, 202958 went to summer camp and 777622 remained at home. So, the difference between the number of children who stayed at home and those who went to summer camp is:

$$ \boxed{202958 - 777622 = -574654} $$

Therefore, more than $574654$ children remained at home instead of going to summer camp."
Response:  The total number of children in Lorens is given as 898,510. During the summer holidays, 629,424 children go to camp and the remaining 269,086 stay at home. So, there are 269,086 children who stay at home.
Response:  The total number of children is 313.473 and during the summer holidays, 274.865 remain at home. So, the number of children who go to camp can be calculated as follows: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children remaining at home Number of children going to camp = 313.473 - 274.865  = 38.608 Therefore, 38,608 children go to camp during the summer holidays.
Response:  We know that during the summer holidays, there are 907.611 children from Lorens village who stay at home and 455.682 children who go to school. So, in total, there are 1363.293 children in Lorens village.
Response:  The passage states that out of 8,000 children from Lorens village, 5,900 attended school during the summer holidays. This means that 2,100 (or 27%) did not attend school. Therefore, there were 2,100 children who remained at home.
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children from Lorens village who were at home during the summer holidays and only 50% of them went to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children x Percentage who went to camp  Number of children who went to camp = 61619 x 0.5  Number of children who went to camp = 30809 Therefore, 30809 children from Lorens village went to camp during the summer holidays.
Response:  The total number of children is given as 34044 + 134867 = 168911.  Of these, 424944 followed the evacuation from outside the village. Therefore, the number of children who went to the shelter is 424944 - 168911 = 256033.
Response:  We know that there are 610769 children from Lorens village who go to school and 590796 children who stay at home. Therefore, the number of children in Lorens is: 610769 + 590796 = 1201565. So, there are 1201565 children in Lorens.
Response:  We know that there were 644,997 children in Lorens during the summer holidays and 893,835 children went to camp. So, the total number of children in Lorens is: 644,997 + 893,835 = 1,538,832 children. Therefore, there are 1,538,832 children in Lorens.
Response:  We know that Ondam has 3 apples more than Jackie. So, if Ondam has 9 apples, then Jackie must have 6 apples (since 9 - 3 = 6). Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response: Ωntam has 10 apples and Jack has 2 apples. So, Ondam has more than Jack in terms of number of apples. The difference between their total number of apples is:  10 - 2 = 8 Therefore, Ondam has 8 more apples than Jack.
Response:  We know that Ωntam has 9 melons and Jack has 10 melons. So, we can say that Jack has more melons than Onatam by 1 (10 - 9 = 1). Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  The Jack has 10 apples and the Ant has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples the Jack has than the Ant, we need to subtract the number of apples the Ant has from the number of apples the Jack has:

Number of apples the Jack has - Number of apples the Ant has = 10 - 8 = 2

So, the Jack has 2 more apples than the Ant."
Response: Ο'νταμ and η Τζάκι have together 6 apples. And it is said that Ε'νταμ has 4 more apples than Τζάκι. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of Apples of Ο'νταμ = Number of Apples of Τζάκι + 4 Therefore, if we know the number of apples of Τζάκι, we can find out the number of apples of Ο'νταμ. According to the question, Τζάκι has 2 apples. So, we can substitute this value in the above equation: Number of Apples of Ο'νταм = 2 + 4 = 6 Therefore, Ο'νταμ has 6 apples.
Response:  The total number of apples is given as 9 more than Antam and Jack together have. So, if Antam has x apples and Jack has y apples, then the total number of apples = x + y + 9. Since Antam has 5 apples and Jack has 3 apples, we can substitute these values in the equation to get: x + y + 9 = 14 (since there are 9 more apples than Antam and Jack together have). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 2 and y = 1. Therefore, Antam has 2 apples and Jack has 1 apple.
Response:  We know that Onda and Jack have together 12 apples. Onda has 9 more apples than Jack. So, Onda has 12 + 9 = 21 apples in total. Therefore, Jack has 12 - 9 = 3 apples.
Response:  We know that Ondam has 4 apples more than Jackie. So, Ondam has 4 + 10 = 14 apples in total. Then, we know that Ondam and Jackie together have 2 extra apples. Therefore, their combined total is 14 + 2 = 16 apples. Finally, we are told that Andam has more apples than both Ondam and Jackie together. So, Andam must have at least 16 + 1 = 17 apples. Thus, Andam has 17 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Odam has more apples than Jack. So, if Odam has x apples, then Jack has x - 5 apples. Since Jack has 89 pears and 11 apples, we can write an equation: x + (x - 5) = 89. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 84. Therefore, Odam has 42 apples.
Response:  The text states that Helen made 31 baskets yesterday morning and 419 baskets until noon today. So, the total number of baskets she made is: 31 + 419 = 450 baskets.
Response:  The text states that Helen made 90 biscuits of sokolata yesterday and 51 today. So, in total, she made 90 + 51 = 141 biscuits of sokolata.
"Response:  The text states that Helen made 527 biscuits and 86 cookies. So, we have:

Number of biscuits = 527
Number of cookies = 86

Now, let's find out how many chocolates Helen gave away today. According to the passage, she gave away 86 chocolates with sticks and 554 chocolates without sticks. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of chocolates as follows:

Total number of chocolates = Number of chocolates with sticks + Number of chocolates without sticks
= 86 + 554
= 638

So, Helen gave away 638 chocolates today."
Response:  The text states that Helen made 144 biscuits and 397 sweets yesterday. Today, she made 85 cookies with cream and 403 cookies with chocolate. So, in total, Helen made 268 cookies today (85 + 403).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Hélène made 19 biscuits sookola (chocolate) yesterday and 231 biscuits stafida (vanilla) today in the morning. Therefore, the total number of biscuits she made is:  19 + 231 = 250 biscuits.  Now, let's find out how many more chocolate biscuits Hélène made than vanilla ones. We are given that the difference between the number of chocolate and vanilla biscuits is equal to the number of biscuits made by Hélène. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Δ = x, where Δ represents the difference between the number of chocolate and vanilla biscuits, and x represents the number of biscuits made by Hélène. Substituting the values we have found earlier, we get:  Δ = 250 - 237 = 13. Therefore, Hélène made 13 more chocolate biscuits than vanilla ones.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helen made 197 biscuits and 46 cookies yesterday evening. Then, today she baked 75 biscuits with icing and 66 biscuits without icing. So, in total, Helen baked 261 biscuits (197 + 75) yesterday and today combined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elen made 519 biscuits and 300 chocolates yesterday. Then, she made 280 more biscuits with sprinkles today morning. Finally, she made 359 more chocolates with sprinkles today afternoon. So, in total, Elen made 519 + 280 = 799 biscuits and 300 + 359 = 659 chocolates.
"Response:  We know that Keti has 81 pieces and her friends have 59 pieces. So, to find out how many more pieces Keti has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of pieces her friends have from the total number of pieces Keti has:

Number of pieces Keti has - Number of pieces her friends have = 81 - 59 = 22

Therefore, Kiti has 22 more pieces than her friends."
Response:  The old friends had 91 games and their new friends had 88 games. So, the total number of games the friends have is: 91 + 88 = 179 games. Therefore, the friends together have 179 games.
Response:  The total number of chess pieces Keiti had was 78 new and 86 old chess pieces. Her friends had 48 new chess pieces. So, together they have 78 + 48 = 126 chess pieces. Therefore, Keiti has 50 more chess pieces than her friends (126 - 48 = 78).
Response:  The total number of toys that Keiti had was 84 new and 19 old.  The friends of Keiti had 8 new toys and 69 old toys. Therefore, the difference in the number of new toys between Keiti and her friends is 8 - 8 = 0.  So, Keiti has no more new toys than her friends.
Response:  The total number of old cards that Keiti had was 80. Since her friends had 73 new cards and 41 old cards, the difference between their total number of cards and hers is:  80 - (73 + 41) = 59. So, Keiti had 59 old cards left.
Response:  We know that Katie had 63 pieces of candy and her friends had 57 pieces. So, to find out how many more pieces Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of pieces her friends have from the number of pieces Katie has: 63 - 57 = 6. Therefore, Katie has 6 more pieces of candy than her friends.
Response:  The number of new toys that Kiti has is 57 - 39 = 18 more than the number of old toys she has. So, the number of new toys that Kiti has is 18 + 34 = 52 more than the number of toys her friends have. Therefore, Kiti has 52 more toys than her friends.
Response:  At first, Frent had $60 and Tjeison had $19. Then, Tjeison bought a car for $33, so now he has $72 ($19 + $33). So, the difference between their money is $8 ($60 - $52).
Response:  At first, Frent had $86 and Jeison had $5. After Frent sold his car on Saturday, he now has $9 + $86 = $95, and Jeison still has $5. Therefore, they have together $95 + $5 = $100.
Response:  At first, Frent had $19 and Jeison had $16. They spent money on car maintenance and now Frent has $40 and Jeison has $69. So, Frent gained $21 ($40 - $19).
Response:  At first, Frent had $114 and Jeison had $22. They spent money on car maintenance and now Frent has $21 and Jeison has $78. So, Jeison gained $57 ($78 - $22) during that week.
Response:  Initially, Frent had $111 and Jeison had $40. Then, Frent spent money on a car and now has $115. Jeison earned money from newspapers and now has $44. So, the difference in their amounts of money is: $115 - $44 = $71. Therefore, Frent gained $71 by selling his car.
Response:  Initially, Frent had $49 and Jeison had $3. After Frent sold his car on Saturday, he gained $75, so now he has $112. Similarly, Jeison earned $20 from selling newspapers, so now he has $63. Therefore, the difference in money earned between them is $59 ($112 - $63).
Response:  At first, Frent had $78 and Jeison had $31. Then, Jeison earned $14 more dollars from his newspaper sales. So, now Jeison has $45 ($31 + $14).  Now, Frent sold his car for $90, so he gained $90 - $78 = $12. Therefore, the difference in money between Frent and Jeison is $12.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frent had $33 and Jeison had $95 initially. Then, Frent spent $16 on newspapers and $74 on car maintenance. So, Frent now has $33 + $16 = $49 and Jeison still has $95 - $74 = $21. Therefore, Frent gained $49 - $33 = $16.
Response:  At first, Frent had $47 and then he received $111 in newspaper money and spent $34 on car maintenance. So, his current amount of money is: $47 + $111 - $34 = $80.
Response:  At first, Tzési had 71 kilograms and lost 20 kilograms. So now she has 51 kilograms. Then, we are asked how much she weighs now. Therefore, her current weight is 51 + 20 = 71 kilograms.
"Response:  Tzési started running and lost 101 kilograms in total. So, if she weighed 27 kilograms before starting to run, then her weight loss per day is:

$$ \text {Weight loss per day} = \frac{Total weight loss}{Number of days} $$

In this case, the total weight loss is $101$ kilograms, and the number of days is $365$, since Tzési ran every day for one year. Therefore, the daily weight loss is:

$$ \text {Daily weight loss} = \frac{101 kg}{365 days} = 0.284 kg/day $$
So, Tzési lost approximately $0.284$ kilograms per day during her one-year running journey."
"Response:  When Jési started running every day, he lost 126 pounds. Now, he weighs 66 pounds less than that. So, his original weight was:

Original weight = Current weight - (Current weight - 126 pounds)
= 66 pounds - (66 pounds - 126 pounds)
= 192 pounds

Therefore, before starting to run every day, Jési weighed 192 pounds."
Response:  When Jési started running every day, he lost 35 kg. Before that, he weighed 69 kg. So, now he weighs less than 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg.
Response:  At first, Tzési lost 50 kg in the first week and then 60 kg in the second week. So, after two weeks, she has lost a total of 110 kg (50 + 60). Therefore, she currently weighs 104 kg (110 - 6).
Response:  Tzesi started running every day from Monday to Friday for one week. On Monday, she lost 62 kg and on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, she lost 140 kg each day. So in total, Tzesi lost 9 x 5 = 45 kg during that week. Therefore, before starting to run, Tzesi weighed 9 - 45 = 46 kg.
Response:  At first, Tzési lost 56 kg in the first week and then gained 99 kg in the second week. So, her total weight loss is:  56 + (99 - 56) = 147 kg. Therefore, she gained 147 kg after the first week.
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 fields and 61 aligators in the zoo. If 64 fields were hidden, then we can deduce that 9 - 64 = 31 fields remained visible. Therefore, there were 31 fields that did not hide.
Response:  We know that there were 93 fields and 97 aligators in total. If 40 of them were hiding, then we can deduce that 57 (93 - 40) aligators did not hide. So, the number of aligators that did not hide is 57.
Response:  We know that in total there were 3 fields and 75 aligators in the zoo. If 82 additional fields and 19 additional aligators appeared, then the total number of fields would be 82 + 3 = 85, and the total number of aligators would be 75 + 19 = 94. So, 94 aligators did not appear.
Response:  We know that in total there were 79 animals in the zoo. If 24 fields and 51 alleys did not contain any animals, then the number of animals that could have been in those areas is equal to the total number of animals minus the number of animals that actually existed in the fields and alleys. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Number of animals that could have been in the fields and alleys = Total number of animals - Number of animals actually existing in the fields and alleys = 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4 So, there were 4 animals that could have been in the fields and alleys but were not present.
Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and gave away 134 of them today. So, he has 37 tomatoes left (171 - 134 = 37). Therefore, 37 tomatoes will remain after today.
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden at first. If he picked 56 of them yesterday and 41 today, then how many are left? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of tomatoes = Initial number of tomatoes - Number picked yesterday - Number picked today Total number of tomatoes = 160 - 56 + 41 = 73 So, there were 73 tomatoes left after both days.
"Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden at first. If he picked 154 tomatoes yesterday and 50 today, then the total number of tomatoes he has now is:

90 + (154 - 90) = 264

So, the farmer has collected 264 tomatoes in total."
"Response:  The farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 patats in his garden. If he added 172 patats, how many tomatoes and patats would he have left?

Tomatoes: 175 - 172 = 3
Patats: 77 + 172 = 249
Therefore, the farmer would have 3 tomatoes and 249 patats left in his garden."
"Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 pumpkins in his garden. If he added 53 more tomatoes, how many tomatoes and pumpkins would he have now?

Tomatoes: 177 + 53 = 230 tomatoes
Pumpkins: 12 + 53 = 65 pumpkins
Therefore, the farmer has 230 tomatoes and 65 pumpkins in his garden after adding 53 more tomatoes."
Response:  The farmer had initially 105 purple tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he added 137 more tomatoes, how many would remain? To find out, we need to subtract the number of new tomatoes from the total initial number of tomatoes. So, the answer is: Number of remaining tomatoes = Initial number of tomatoes - New tomatoes = 105 + 71 = 176 Tomato
Response:  If John needs to cut large pieces of wood for his house and each piece requires 2 wooden beams from the 4 trees he has, then we can calculate how many pieces of wood he will need as follows: Number of pieces of wood = Total number of beams / Number of beams required per piece So, if John has 4 trees with 8 beams in total (since each tree provides 2 beams), and he needs 2 beams per piece, then he will need: Number of pieces of wood = 8 beams / 2 beams per piece = 4 pieces of wood Therefore, John will need 4 pieces of wood to build his house.
"Response:  We know that for each large beam (13 beams in total), we need 17 pieces of wood to make one complete beam. So, the total number of pieces of wood needed for all 13 beams is:

13 beams x 17 pieces/beam = 201 pieces of wood

Now, let's consider the smaller beams (8 beams). For each small beam, we need 8 pieces of wood to make one complete beam. So, the total number of pieces of wood needed for all 8 beams is:

8 beams x 8 pieces/beam = 64 pieces of wood

Adding both amounts together gives us the total number of pieces of wood needed for Jon's roof:

201 + 64 = 265 pieces of wood

Therefore, Jon needs 265 pieces of wood to build his roof."
Response:  We know that Jon needs to cut large pieces of wood for his house. Each piece requires 3 planks from the 11 boards he has available. So, in total, Jon needs 33 planks (11 boards x 3 planks per board).
"Response:  The large boards require 15 pieces of nails for each board, and the small boards require 5 pieces of nails per board. Since there are 12 large boards and 10 small boards, we need a total of:

Large boards: 12 x 15 = 180 nails
Small boards: 10 x 5 = 50 nails
Total number of nails needed: 180 + 50 = 230 nails
Therefore, John needs 230 nails to fix the roof."
Response:  Since Jon used large wooden beams to build his house, each beam requires two nails (one at each end). So, for one beam, he needs 4 nails. Now, since he wants to use 16 beams, he needs 16 x 4 = 64 nails in total. Therefore, John needs 64 nails to build his house.
"Response:  If John needs 74 carvings of each piece of wood to cover one wall with 8 large boards, then he will need:

Number of boards = Number of carvings / Number of pieces per board
= 74 carvings / 8 pieces per board
= 9 boards (rounded up)
Therefore, John needs 9 large boards of wood to cover one wall with 8 large boards."
Response:  We know that there are 12 large pieces of wood and 17 small pieces of wood needed for the roof. Each large piece of wood requires 14 joints to be connected, and each small piece of wood requires 25 joints to be connected. So, in total, Jon needs 12 x 14 = 168 joints from the large pieces of wood and 17 x 25 = 425 joints from the small pieces of wood. Therefore, Jon needs a total of 168 + 425 = 593 joints for the entire roof.
Response:  We know that there are 3 compartments in each package and a total of 42 compartments for all packages combined. So, if Robert has X packages, then he must have X x 3 = 96 compartments in total. Therefore, Robert has 96 packages.
"Response:  We know that Rombin has 43 packages of chocolates and each package contains 23 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of chocolates Rombin has is:

43 packages x 23 pieces/package = 1009 pieces of chocolate

Now we are asked how many extra chocolates Rombin has. We know that he has 8 more chocolates than he actually has. So, the additional number of chocolates Rombin has is:

8 extra chocolates = 8 / 23 = 0.35 (whole numbers)

Therefore, the final answer to the question is:

Rombin has 1009 + 0.35 = 1014 pieces of chocolate."
Response:  We know that there are 7 compartments in each package of Rombin's sweets. Since Rombin has 6 extra sweets, he must have 7 x 6 = 42 packages of sweets in total. Therefore, Rombin has 42 packages of sweets.
"Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of apples and 13 packages of oranges. Each package has 4 fruits. So, in total, we have:
Apples: 28 x 4 = 112 fruits
Oranges: 13 x 4 = 52 fruits
So, Robert has 164 fruits in total (112 + 52)."
Response:  We know that Rombin has 21 bags of chocolates and 45 bags of caramels. Each bag of chocolates contains 9 pieces, so Rombin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of chocolate. Similarly, each bag of caramels contains 9 pieces, so Rombin has 45 x 9 = 375 pieces of caramel. Therefore, Rombin has in total 189 + 375 = 564 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of rice and 14 packages of caramel. Each package has 6 pieces. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:  Number of pieces of rice = 28 x 6 = 168 pieces Number of pieces of caramel = 14 x 6 = 84 pieces Therefore, Robert has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of candy.
Response:  The machine can move 3 pucks in one second. It moved 6 pucks. So it worked for (6/3) = 2 seconds.
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes and could produce 4 puckamis in that time. So, we can calculate how many puckamis the machine produced per minute as follows:  Puckamis produced = Number of puckamis produced during the time the machine worked / Time the machine worked = 4 / 5 = 0.8 puckamis/minute. Therefore, the machine produced 0.8 puckamis per minute.
Response:  The machine produced 9 pucks yesterday and 44 today. If it can produce 3 more tomorrow, then... (1) Yesterday, the machine produced x pucks. (2) Today, the machine produced 44 + 3 = 47 pucks. So, (1) Yesterday, the machine produced 9 pucks.
Response:  The machine produced 13 pucks yesterday and 3 today. If it can produce 8 more tomorrow, then in total it will have produced 24 pucks (13 + 3 + 8). So, the time taken to produce those pucks is 24 / 5 = 4.8 hours.
Response:  The machine produced 9 pucks yesterday and 8 today. If it can produce 2 more tomorrow, then... (1) Yesterday, the machine produced x pucks, where x = 9 - 8 = 1. (2) Today, the machine produced y pucks, where y = 8. (3) Tomorrow, the machine will produce z pucks, where z = 2 + 1 = 3. So, the total number of pucks produced by the machine in one day is: x + y + z = 1 + 8 + 3 = 12. Therefore, the machine produced 12 pucks in one day.
Response:  The machine can make 3 pucks in one minute. Yesterday it made 4 pucks and today it made 8 pucks. So, the number of minutes the machine worked is: 3 + 4 = 7 minutes yesterday and 8 + 1 = 9 minutes today. Therefore, the total number of minutes the machine worked is 7 + 9 = 16 minutes.
Response:  On Thursday (12 hours), the machine could have drilled 14 holes. So, in total, it drilled 14 + 6 = 20 holes.
Response:  On Thursday (yesterday), the machine worked for 5 hours and produced 12 puckams of ice cream. So, in total, it produced 12 x 5 = 60 puckams of ice cream yesterday.

So, they earned $ 32 per minute."
"Response:  The carnival lasted for 22 days and the player won $144 per day. Therefore, the total amount of money he/she won is:
$144 x 22 = $3,088
So, the player won $3,088 during the carnival."
Response:  The carnival game paid out $420 every time it was played, and they played it 30 times in total. So, the amount of money that the pair won from the carnival game is: $420 x 30 = $12600. Now, let's subtract the amount of money that the pawnshop owner gave them for the watch: $12600 - $22 = $12578. Therefore, the pawnshop owner owes them $12578.
Response:  The first 44 minutes of play earned $382, and the remaining 10 minutes earned $374. Therefore, the total amount won during the entire game was: $382 + $374 = $756.
Response:  The daktylium made $120 in the first 20 minutes and $66 in the remaining 16 minutes for a total of $186. So, during the first 20 minutes, the daktylium made $120 / 20 = $6 per minute.
Response:  The daktyliou made $325 in the first 154 parts and $114 in the remaining 57 parts. So, the total amount earned per day was: $325 x 154 = $49,600 + $114 x 57 = $6,380 = $55,980 per day.

Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus. According to the problem, each bus can have at most 36 people. So, the number of people who are currently on the bus is: 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 people on the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people at the bus stop. Then, 12 more people got on the bus and 3 got off. So, the number of people at the bus stop now is: 8 + 12 - 3 = 23 people are at the bus stop right now.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people in the bus now is:  4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people in the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 of them got off. So, how many people are left in the train now?  Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that there were 22 students in the program and 676 participants overall. To find out how many students were currently enrolled in the program, we can subtract the number of participants who completed their training from the total number of participants. So, the number of students currently enrolled in the program is:  Number of students = Total participants - Completed participants = 676 - 22 = 654 Therefore, there were 654 students currently enrolled in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 grandparents and 724 students in the program. To find out how many teachers were present, we need to subtract the number of students from the total number of people mentioned in the question. Therefore, the number of teachers was:  73 (grandparents) - 724 (students) = 651. So, there were 651 teachers present in the program.
"Response:  We know that there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students besides them. To find out how many more students than parents were in the program, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants (students + parents):

Total number of participants = 174 parents + 521 students = 695

So, there were 695 - 174 = 521 more students than parents in the program."
Response:  We know that there were 61 teachers in the program and 177 students as well. So, the total number of people involved in the program is 61 + 177 = 238. Now, we are asked how many people were present at the event. Since the program could accommodate 44 guests, the number of people present at the event is 238 - 44 = 204. Therefore, there were 204 people present at the event.
Response:  The cave is 919 feet deep and must travel 1307 feet to reach its destination. To find out how far away from the end of the cave they are, we need to subtract the depth of the cave (919) from the total distance traveled (1307). So, the answer is: Distance = 1307 - 919 = 388 feet.
Response:  The cave is 1218 meters deep and has already been descended to 849 meters. If they travel at a speed of 17 meters per minute, how much further will they have to go until they reach the bottom of the cave? To find this out, we need to subtract the depth of the cave from their current position: Distance = Depth - Current Position = 1218 - 849 = 369 meters So, they still have 369 meters to go until they reach the bottom of the cave.
Response:  The distance from point A to point B is 659 feet and the well is 762 feet deep. To find out how far they have left until they reach the bottom of the well, we need to subtract the depth of the well (762) from the total distance traveled (659). So, the remaining distance until they reach the bottom of the well is: 659 - 762 = -103 feet. Therefore, they still have 103 feet to go before reaching the bottom of the well.
Response:  The unstoppable goats want to eat as many chrysolite pebbles in the lake as possible without getting caught. They have already eaten 8 chrysolite pebbles initially. So, the number of chrysolite pebbles that disappeared is equal to the difference between the total number of chrysolite pebbles and the number of pebbles they have already eaten. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of chrysolite pebbles = 6 (given) - Number of chrysolite pebbles eaten by the goats = 8 (given) = 6 - 8 = -2 chrysolite pebbles disappeared.
Response:  We know that 7 chrysolophus and 12 gatos were in the lake initially. Since the cats are not able to catch fish, they have remained there. Therefore, the number of fish that have escaped is equal to the initial number of fish minus the number of fish caught by the cats. So, we can write: Number of fish that escaped = Initial number of fish - Number of fish caught by the cats. In this case, the initial number of fish was 7 x 12 = 84 fish. Now, since the cats could only catch 3 chrysolophus and 6 gatos, the total number of fish caught by them is 3 + 6 = 9 fish. Therefore, the number of fish that escaped is: Number of fish that escaped = 84 - 9 = 75 fish.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 chrysolite beads and 71 goat beads in the lake. Then, the big cat took 16 of them (chrysolite beads) and left 71 goat beads. Now, we are told that two of the original three cats have returned to the lake. So, the number of chrysolite beads that have remained in the lake is equal to the number of cats that did not take any beads. Therefore, the answer is: 2 x 16 = 32 chrysolite beads remain in the lake.
"Response:  The peacock increased its tail feathers by 15 and there were five hunters who chased it but failed to catch it. How many chrysolite pebbles remained?

Let X be the number of chrysolite pebbles that remained after the peacock increased its tail feathers by 15. Since the hunters failed to catch it, we can say that the peacock did not lose any chrysolite pebbles. Therefore, we have:
X = original amount of chrysolite pebbles - (number of hunters x number of times they failed to catch the peacock)
= 10 (original amount of chrysolite pebbles) - (5 x 0)
= 10

So, there were still 10 chrysolite pebbles remaining after the peacock increased its tail feathers by 15."
Response:  The man had 2 apples and 43 apples in total. If he gave some away, then he has fewer apples now than he did initially. So, the number of apples he has left is equal to the initial amount minus the number of apples he gave away. In this case, that would be 43 - 2 = 41 apples.
Response:  The seal had 58 apples initially and used some to make pies, which reduced its total number of apples by 35. So, how many apples were left? We can calculate this as follows: Number of apples left = Initial number of apples - Number of apples used for pies = 58 - 35 = 23 apples. Therefore, there were 23 apples remaining after the seal made pies from some of its initial 58 apples.
Response:  The seal had 40 apples and 54 rodaks. After making some pies that left him with 39 apples. So he used how many apples to make the pies?  We can see that the number of apples he used is equal to the difference between the total number of apples he had (40) and the number of apples he had after making the pies (39). Therefore, the answer is 1 apple.
Response:  There are 4 racks in total and each rack can hold 11 action figures. So, the total number of action figures that Ontam could have placed on all four racks is: 4 x 11 = 44 action figures.
Response:  The room can accommodate 8 actions, and Odysseus wants to perform 10 actions in total. So, we need to find out how many actions he cannot perform in his own room. To do this, we divide the number of actions he wants to perform (10) by the capacity of his room (8): 10 / 8 = 1.25. Since you cannot have a fraction of an action, Odysseus cannot perform more than 10 actions in his own room. Therefore, there are 3 actions that he cannot perform in his room (10 - 8 = 3).
Response:  We know that Odysseus and his men can fit in 8 bags of wine and 10 oars inside each room. Since there are 4 rooms in total, they will be able to fit 32 bags of wine (8 x 4 = 32) and 40 oars (10 x 4 = 40).
"Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens and each garden has 32 lilies. So, we have:
Number of gardens = 10
Number of lilies per garden = 32
Now, let's calculate how many lilies there are in total:
Total number of lilies = Number of gardens x Number of lilies per garden
= 10 x 32
= 320 lilies
So, there are 320 lilies in total."
Response:  We know that there are 466 docheia and each docheio has 53 loulioudia and 181 mastounia. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of loulioudia = Total number of docheia x Number of loulioudia per docheio Number of mastounia = Total number of docheia x Number of mastounia per docheio Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Number of loulioudia = 466 x 53 = 24,980 Number of mastounia = 466 x 181 = 87,366 Therefore, there are 24,980 loulioudia and 87,366 mastounia in total.
Response:  We know that there are 141 hostels and each hostel has 71 beds and 91 mattresses. So, we can write an equation as follows: Hostels = Number of beds x Number of mattresses. In this case, the number of beds is 71, and the number of mattresses is 91, so we can substitute these values in the equation to get: Hostels = 71 x 91 = 6311. Therefore, there are 6311 hostels.
Response:  We know that every docheio has 40 loulioudia. Therefore, if we have x number of docheia, each one will have 40 loulioudia. So, the total number of loulioudia is x times 40 = 40x. Now, we are told that there are 400 loulioudia in total. Therefore, the number of docheia must be 400 / 40 = 10. So, there are 10 docheia.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in total and 4276 of them belong to Stephen. If we divide the remaining skittles (4502 - 4276 = 224) among 154 teams, each team will have an average of:

$$ \frac{224}{154} = 1.48 $$

So, each team will have approximately 1.48 skittles on average."
Response:  We know that there are 3941 skittles in Stephen's collection and he also has 4950 sweets. If we assume that these sweets are organized into 495 groups of equal size (i.e., each group contains an equal number of sweets), then we can find out how many sweets are in each group as follows: Number of sweets in each group = Total number of sweets / Number of groups = 4950 / 495 = 10 So, each group contains 10 sweets.
Response:  We know that there are 896 skittles in total and Stiven has 517 of them. That means he has 379 skittles left. If we divide this number by 8 (the number of groups), then each group has 47 skittles (379 / 8 = 47).
Response:  Since there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes So, there are 54 classes in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in total and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class Total number of students = 304 x 75 Total number of students = 22,550 students. Therefore, there were approximately 22,550 students at the school.
