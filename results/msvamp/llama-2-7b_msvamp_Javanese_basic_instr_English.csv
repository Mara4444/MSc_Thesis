Response:  The area of the carpet needed is 10 square feet. To determine the length of the carpet required for each room, we need to divide the total area by the length of each room. In this case, if there are 5 rooms with an average length of 3 feet (or 9 square feet), then the length of each room would be: $ \text{Length} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Number of Rooms}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ feet} $
Response:  The area of the carpet needed is 40 square feet (10 x 4 = 40).
Response:  The area of the carpet is 18 square meters (m²).) and it needs to cover an area of 4 square meters (m²) in the room with a height of 20 feet (ft.). Therefore, the number of pieces of carpet needed can be calculated as follows: Area of carpet = 18 m² Number of pieces of carpet = Area of room / Area of carpet = 4 m² / 18 m² = 0.22 or approximately 1/4 piece of carpet.

Response:  Helen made 197 chocolate cookies and 46 sprinkle cookies. She also baked 75 sugar cookies and 66 coklat chip cookies. If we assume that each type of cookie is equally popular among the guests, then the number of cookies eaten by each guest can be estimated as follows: For chocolate cookies, since there were 197 cookies in total, each guest ate approximately 0.1 (or 1/10) of a cookie. Therefore, 19 guests ate at least one chocolate cookie. Similarly, for sprinkle cookies, since there were 46 cookies in total, each guest ate approximately 0.08 (or 8/10) of a cookie. Therefore, 23 guests ate at least one sprinkle cookie. For sugar cookies, since there were 75 cookies in total, each guest ate approximately 0.1 (or 1/10) of a cookie. Therefore, 75 guests ate at least one sugar cookie. And finally, for coklat chip cookies, since there were 66 cookies in total, each guest ate approximately 0.1 (or 1/10) of a cookie. Therefore, 66 guests ate at least one coklat chip cookie.
