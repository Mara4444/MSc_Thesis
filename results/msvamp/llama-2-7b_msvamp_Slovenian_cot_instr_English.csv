Response:  In Ponuedeljek (Monday), Julia played with 18 children.  In Tuesday (Tuesday), she played with 10 children. So, we can say that in Monday, Julia played with more children than in Tuesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday is: 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 11 kids.  In Tuesday, she played with 12 kids. So, we can say that the number of children Julia played with in Tuesday is 12 - 11 = 1 more than the number of children she played with in Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Tuesday and Monday is 1 child.
Response:  Julia played with children in Monday and Tuesday. If she played with 5 children on Monday, then she played with 15 other children on Tuesday (since 5 + 15 = 20). So, Julia played with 15 children on Tuesday.
Response:  In Ponuedeljek (Monday), Julia played with 5 children.  In Tuesday (Tuesday), she played with 14 children. So, if she plays with 16 children in total, then she must have played with 2 more children than she did in Monday. Therefore, Julia played with 7 additional children in Tuesday compared to Monday.
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children in Monday and more than 12 children in Tuesday, then she must have played with at least 4 children less in Tuesday than in Monday. So, if Julia played with 16 children in Monday, then she played with 12 + 4 = 16 children in Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children in Tuesday and more than 8 children in Wednesday, then she must have played with at least 22 children (14 + 8 = 22).
Response:  On Monday (ponedeljek), Julia played with 17 children. In Tuesday (torek), she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday (sreda), she played with only two children. So, altogether Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
"Response:  In Ponuedeljek (Monday), Julia played with 15 children. In Tork (Tuesday), she played with 18 children. So far, we have:
Julia played with x children in Monday and y children in Tuesday.
We know that the total number of children Julia played with is equal to the sum of the numbers of children she played with in each day:
x + y = 97
Now we can substitute the values we know into the equation:
15 + 18 = 97
Solving for x and y, we get:
33 = 97
So Julia played with 33 children in Monday and 65 children in Tuesday."
Response:  In Ponuedeljek (Monday), Julia played with five children. In Tuesday (Tork), she played with nine children and in Wednesday (Sreda) she played with fifteen children. So, we can say that Julia played with x = 5 children in Monday, y = 9 children in Tuesday and z = 15 children in Wednesday. Now, we need to find the missing values of x, y and z. We know that x + y + z = 20, since Julia played with all these numbers of children together. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: 5 + 9 + 15 = 20. Solving for x, y and z, we get: x = 5, y = 9 and z = 15.
Response:  On Monday (ponedeljek), Julia played with two children.  On Tuesday (torek), she played with 14 children. Therefore, Julia played with 12 children on Wednesday (sredo).
Response:  In Ponuedeljek, Julia played with 9 children.  In Tork, she played with 7 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with in Ponuedeljek and Tork is:  9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children in Ponuedeljek than in Tork.
Response:  In Poniedeljek (Monday), Julia played with 14 children.  In Torek (Tuesday), she played with 2 children.  And in Sreda (Wednesday), she played with 8 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children in Monday than in Wednesday. The difference between these two numbers is: 14 - 8 = 6. Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children in Monday than in Wednesday.
Response:  In Monday (ponedeljek), Julia played with eight children.  In Tuesday (torek), she played with eleven children. So, we can say that the number of children Julia played with in Tuesday is greater than the number of children she played with in Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Tuesday and Monday is equal to eleven - eight = three.
Response:  In Poniedeljek (Monday), Julia played with 15 children.  In Tuesday (Torek), she played with 18 children. And in Wednesday (Sreda), she played with only 7 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children in Monday than in any other day. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Wednesday is:  15 - 7 = 8.
Response:  On Monday (ponedeljek), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (torek), she played cards with 10 children. In Wednesday (sreda), she played with 15 children. So, altogether they have played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (ponedeljek), Julia played with 7 kids. On Tuesday (torek), she played cards with 13 kids. In Wednesday (sreda), she played with 20 kids altogether. So, Julia played with a total of 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children.
Response:  Julia played with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday. In total, she spent 34 hours playing Tag with both groups of children. So, we can calculate the number of children Julia played with as follows: Number of children = Total time spent playing / Time spent per child We know that Julia spent 34 hours playing Tag in total. If she played with 12 kids for one day (Monday), then she spent 34/12 = 2.8 hours playing with each group of kids. Similarly, if she played with 14 kids for another day (Tuesday), then she spent 34/14 = 2.43 hours playing with each group of kids. Since we cannot have a fraction of a child, let's round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Julia played with 12 + 14 = 26 children in total.
Response:  In Ponuedeljek, Julia played with 19 children for 4 hours (2 hours x 9 children).  In Tork, she played with 18 children for 3 hours (2 hours x 9 children). So in total, Julia spent 7 hours playing Tag with children. Therefore, there are 7 - 4 = 3 more children that Julia played with in Tuesday than in Tuesday.
Response:  In Tuesday (torek), Julia played with 5 children.  In Monday (ponedeljek), she played with 6 children. So, we can say that in Ponuedeljek there were 1 more child than in Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between number of children in Ponuedeljek and Tuesday is equal to 1.
Response:  Julia played with 18 kids overall. On Monday she played with 4 kids and on Tuesday she played with some additional kids. So, if we add the number of kids she played with on Monday to the number of kids she played with on Tuesday, we get: 4 + x = 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. Therefore, Julia played with 10 kids on Tuesday.
Response:  In Ponuedeljek (Monday), Julia played with 4 children.  In Tuesday (Tuesday), she played with 6 children. So, we can say that Julia played with more children in Monday than in Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday is 2 (i.e., 6 - 4).
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 25 bonbons and then he had 43 left, that means he started with x bonbons. Since he ate 25 of them, we can write an equation: x - 25 = 43. Solving for x, we get: x = 68. So, Bobby started with 68 bonbons.
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 28 pieces of candy and then he ate another 42 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 60 pieces of candy (28 + 42 = 60). Then, he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby has eaten is 60 + 63 = 123 pieces of sweets.  So, Bobby has poyedel 123 bombons.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby has eaten 33 pieces of candy. If he then eats another 4 pieces, that means he has eaten a total of 37 pieces of candy (33 + 4 = 37). Next, we are told that Bobby also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. So, if he had already eaten 37 pieces of candy, and then added 14 pieces of chocolate, that would bring his total to 51 pieces of candy and chocolate combined (37 + 14 = 51). Therefore, Bobby has popped 51 pieces of candy and chocolate into his mouth.
"Response:  Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces. So, in total, he has eaten 74 pieces of candy. Now, we are told that he also ate 16 chocolate pieces. Therefore, the number of bombons (chocolate candies) that Bobby has eaten is:

$$ \text {Number of bombons} = \text{Total number of pieces of candy} - \text{Number of chocolate pieces} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of bombons} = 74 - 16 = 58 $$

Therefore, Bobby has eaten $58$ bombons ($=58$ chocolate candies)."
Response:  Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces of bonbons. So far, he has eaten 34 + 20 = 54 pieces of sweets. Then he ate another 18 pieces of bonbons. Therefore, Bobby has eaten in total 54 + 18 = 72 pieces of sweeties.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, he has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 bonbons. He ate some of them and then he ate another 5. So, at this point, he has eaten a total of 5 + 5 = 10 bonbons. Therefore, there are 22 - 10 = 12 bonbons left.
Response:  If Bobby had 19 bonbons and he ate two pieces of candy, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 bonbons left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some bonbons, then he has fewer candies left. We don't know how many bonbons he ate, but let's assume it is x. Then we can write an equation: 32 - x = 20 (pieces of candy left) Now solve for x: x = 12 (number of bonbons eaten by Bobby) So, Bobby ate 12 bonbons.
Response:  If Bobby had 17 pieces of candy and then ate another 15, he would have 32 pieces of candy in total (17 + 15 = 32). So, there are 32 - 36 = -4 remaining pieces of candy.
Response:  If Bobby has 23 pieces of candy and he had 30 bonbons in total, then he must have given away 7 bonbons (30 - 23 = 7). So, there are still 23 pieces of candy left with him.
"Response:  If Alan had brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake had brought 3 balloons, then we can say that:

Alan has 5 - 3 = 2 more balloons than Jake.

So, the answer is 2."
Response:  If Alan brought two balloons to the park and Jake brought three balloons to the park, then we can say that Jake had three more balloons than Alan. So, the difference between the number of balloons brought by Jake and Alan is equal to three. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Alan brought 3 balloons to the park and he brought 2 of them, then Jake must have brought 1 balloon to the park. So, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  If Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park and he has brought more than Allan, then we can say that Jake has brought at least 4 balloons more than Allan. So, if Allan has brought x balloons, then Jake has brought 6 - x balloons. Now, we are given that Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park, so we can set up the equation: 6 = 6 - x. Solving for x, we get x = 0, which means that Allan has also brought 6 balloons to the park. Therefore, the correct answer is: Jake has brought 4 balloons more than Allan.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 more than Allan, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 3 balloons and gave 2 to Jake, so he had 3 - 2 = 1 balloon left. Then, Jake got 5 balloons from Alan, so he had 5 + 1 = 6 balloons in total. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Alan and Jake had together in the park is 6.
"Response: 
Alan had two balloons and gave one to Jake. So, now Alan has one balloon left, and Jake has three balloons (the ones he already had plus the one Alan gave him).  Now, Alan buys three more balloons in the park. This means that Alan has four balloons in total (including the one he already had), while Jake still has three balloons.  Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons Alan has and Jake has is:  Four - Three = One.  So, Alan has one more balloon than Jake in the park."
"Response: 
Allen brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more balloons there. So Allen has six balloons in total (2 + 3 = 6).
Jake had six balloons in the park plus the additional balloons he bought, so Jake had nine balloons in total (6 + 3 = 9). Therefore, Jake had more than Allen. The correct answer is 9 - 6 = 3."
"Response: 
Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more balloons there. So, he brought a total of 8 balloons (5 + 3) to the park."
"Response: 
Alan has brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake has brought 2 balloons to the park. So far, they have 8 balloons between them (6 + 2 = 8).  Then, Jake buys three more balloons in the park, so now he has 5 balloons (2 + 3 = 5). Now we need to find out how many balloons does Alan have more than Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of balloons that Jake has from the total number of balloons that Alan had: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Alan has one more balloon than Jake in the park."
"Response: 
Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. So far, they have 9 balloons between them (6 + 3 = 9). Then, Jake bought 4 more balloons in the park, so he has 13 balloons now (9 + 4 = 13). Therefore, Jake has 13 balloons in the park more than Alan does. The difference is 13 - 9 = 4."
Response:  Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more balloons there. So, altogether he brought 8 balloons (5 + 3) to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 6 - 8 = -2 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park. So he had 3 + 20 = 23 objects in total. Similarly, we know that Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the park. So he had 5 + 59 = 64 objects in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of objects brought by Alan and Jake is: 64 - 23 = 41 objects. So, Alan and Jake had 41 balloons each in the park.
Response:  We know that Alan had 7 balloons and 5 balls, so he had 7 + 5 = 12 toys in total. Similarly, we know that Jake had 6 balloons and 4 balls, so he had 6 + 4 = 10 toys in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of toys Alan had and the number of toys Jake had is 12 - 10 = 2. So, Alan had 2 more toys than Jake in the park.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 1 more (a total of 6), then we can say that Jake brought half as many balloons as Alan did. So, Jake brought 5/2 = 3 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more balloons there. So, initially, Allan had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in the park. Now, we are told that Jake brought six balloons to the park. This means that Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park. Therefore, Jake had one more balloon than Allan in the park.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese per day, then he will spend a total of:

English: 6 x 24 = 144 hours/week
Chinese: 2 x 24 = 48 hours/week
Total time spent studying both languages: 144 + 48 = 192 hours/week
Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying English than Chinese."
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese, then he is spending more time studying Chinese than English. So, Ryan spends (7 - 6) = 1 hour more per day studying Chinese than English. Therefore, Ryan spends 1/24 = 0.0417 hours more per day studying Chinese than English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and also learns Chinese for some time, then he will spend total of 3 + x hours per day learning Chinese where 'x' is the number of hours he spends learning English. Now if he spends 4 hours per day learning English, then we can write an equation as follows: Total hours spent on Chinese = 3 + 4 = 7 hours/day So, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and still has some time to study Chinese, then he spent more than 2 hours studying English than Chinese. So, if he studies Chinese for x hours, then he studied English for 7 - x hours. Therefore, Ryan learned Chinese for x/7 = (7-x)/7 hours.
Response:  If Ryan spends 2 hours learning Chinese and then switches to English for another 4 hours, he will have spent a total of 6 hours learning English (2 + 4 = 6). So, if he learns English for twice as long as he learned Chinese, he will have spent 12 hours learning English (6 x 2 = 12).
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese per day, then he has studied for a total of 6 x 5 = 30 hours in English and 7 x 5 = 35 hours in Chinese. So, Ryan has spent a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages together.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese per day, then he has spent a total of:

6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours studying English
5 hours/day x 2 days = 10 hours studying Chinese

So, in total, Ryan has spent 22 hours (12 + 10) learning both languages."
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 8 hours and Chinese for 4 hours per day, then he has studied English for 2 x 8 = 16 hours and Chinese for 4 x 4 = 16 hours in total. So, if he studies both languages for 6 days, he will have spent a total of 16 + 16 = 32 hours studying them.
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 4 hours per day and Chinese for 6 hours per day, he spends a total of 10 hours (4 + 6) per day on language learning. Since there are 86 days until the end of summer vacation, Ryan will spend a total of 860 hours (10 hours/day x 86 days) studying languages during this period. Therefore, Ryan spends approximately 9.75 hours per day (860 hours / 86 days) studying both English and Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English, he has studied English for 6 hours.  If he studies Chinese for 7 hours, then he has studied Chinese for 7 hours. And if he studies Spanish for 3 hours, then he has studied Spanish for 3 hours. So, in total, Ryan has studied each language for the following number of hours:  English - 6 hours; Chinese - 7 hours; Spanish - 3 hours. Therefore, Ryan has spent a total of 16 hours studying these three languages (6 + 7 + 3 = 16)."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, 3 hours per day studying Chinese, and 58 hours per week studying Spanish. To calculate how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to find the difference between the total number of hours he spends studying English and the total number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, let's do that: Total hours spent studying English = 6 x 24 (hours per day) = 144 Total hours spent studying Chinese = 3 x 24 = 72 Total hours spent studying Spanish = 58 x 7 = 406 Now, let's subtract the total hours spent studying Chinese from the total hours spent studying English: Difference = Total hours studying English - Total hours studying Chinese = 144 - 72 = 72 Therefore, Ryan spends 72 more hours studying English than Chinese.
"Response: 
Ryan has spent 7 hours studying English and 4 hours studying Spanish. He also spends 2 hours studying Chinese. So he has studied for a total of 7 + 4 = 11 hours.  Therefore, he has spent more time studying English than Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan takes 5 hours to learn Chinese and 4 hours to learn Spanish, then he will spend more time learning Chinese than Spanish. So, the difference between the number of hours spent learning Chinese and Spanish is equal to the total number of hours spent learning both languages. Therefore, the answer is: 20 hours (5 + 4 = 20).
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, respectively, then he will spend a total of 6 hours per day (3 + 3) learning both languages together. Therefore, if he learns English for 2 hours per day, he will learn Chinese for 4 hours per day (6 - 2).
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese. In total, he spends 4 + 5 = 9 hours per day on language learning. Since he studies for 7 days, he has studied a total of 9 x 7 = 63 hours. So, Ryan has learned 63 hours of English and 63 hours of Chinese.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 bags of plastic bottles for recycling. The next day (Tuesday), she found an additional 7 bags of plastic bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of plastic bottles on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 7 containers of plastic bottles for recycling. The next day (Tuesday), she found an additional 12 containers of plastic bottles. So, in total, she found 19 containers of plastic bottles on Tuesday (12 + 7). Therefore, the answer is 19.
Response:  If Tiffany collected plastic bottles for recycling and had 4 bottles on Monday, she found an additional 3 bottles on Tuesday. Therefore, her total number of bottles is 4 + 3 = 7.
Response:  If Tiffany collected plastic bottles for recycling and had 4 more bottles on Monday, then she must have started with 8 bottles (4 + 4 = 8). Therefore, Tiffany had 8 bottles in her collection on Monday.
Response:  If Tiffany collected plastic bottles for recycling and had 10 containers on Monday, she found 3 more containers on Tuesday, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 containers. Therefore, Tiffany had 13 containers in total.
Response:  On Monday (ponedeljak), Tiffany collected 8 plastic bottles for recycling. The next day (utorok), she found 10 more plastic bottles and 4 more the following day (sreda). So, in total, Tiffany collected 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 plastic bottles. Therefore, the correct answer is 22.
"Response:  We know that Tiffany collected plastic bottles for recycling and had three containers full of them on Monday. The next day she found an additional 7 containers filled with plastic bottles and 44 glass jars. So, we can calculate how many containers were filled with plastic bottles as follows:

Containers filled with plastic bottles = Total number of containers - Containers filled on Monday + Containers found the next day
= 3 + 7 = 10

Therefore, Tiffany had 10 containers filled with plastic bottles."
Response:  We know that there are 17 red beads and 16 green beads in the basket. To find out how many more red beads than green beads there are, we can divide the number of red beads by the number of green beads:  Number of red beads / Number of green beads = 17/16 = 10  So, there are 10 more red beads than green beads in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red beans and 11 green beans in the basket. To find out how many more green beans there are than red beans, we can subtract the number of red beans from the total number of beans:  Number of green beans = Total number of beans - Number of red beans  Number of green beans = 11 - 5  Number of green beans = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more green beans than red beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red beads and some green beads in the bag. If there are 15 beads in total, then we can assume that the number of red beads is half of the total number of beads (since they make up half of the bag). So, if there are 15 beads in total, then there must be 7-8 red beads in the bag (half of 15). Therefore, there are 7 or 8 red beads in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are red apples and green apples in the bag. If there are more than 10 green apples than red ones, then we can say that the number of green apples is greater than or equal to 10. So, if there are 5 red apples and 12 green apples, then the number of green apples is greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red beads, 15 red beads, and 8 green beads in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation: 7 + 15 = x (where x is the number of green beads). Since there are 8 green beads, we can substitute this value into our equation: 7 + 15 = 8. Solving for x gives us x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 green beads in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 8 green beads in the bag.  There are also 7 red beads and 71 yellow beads. So, we can write this equation: 8G + 7R + 71Y = X, where G represents the number of green beads, R represents the number of red beads, Y represents the number of yellow beads, and X is the total number of beads in the bag. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: 8G + 7R + 71Y = 8 + 7 + 71 = 86. Therefore, there are 86 beads in the bag, including 8 green ones. So, there are more green beads than red beads in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 14 green beans and 6 red beans in the basket. To find out how many more green beans than red beans there are, we can divide the number of green beans by the number of red beans: 14/6 = 2. So, there are 2 more green beans than red beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red beads, 11 yellow beads and 12 green beads in the basket. To find out how many more red beads than yellow beads there are, we can use the following equation: Number of red beads - Number of yellow beads = Difference between red and yellow beads. In this case, the number of red beads is 19, the number of yellow beads is 11, so the difference between red and yellow beads is: 19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more red beads than yellow beads in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red beads and 16 green beads in the basket. So, we can write this as follows: 6R + 16G = Total number of beads in the basket  Now, let's find out how many red beads there are: 6R = Number of red beads x  Number of red beads = 6 x 5 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 red beads in the basket. Similarly, we can find out how many green beads there are: 16G = Number of green beads x Number of green beads = 16 x 4 = 64 Therefore, there are 64 green beads in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red beads and 14 red beads in the basket. So, we have a total of 32 red beads. Now, let's find out how many red beads are in the basket. To do this, we divide the number of red beads by the total number of beads in the basket:  Number of red beads = Total number of beads x Percentage of red beads  Number of red beads = 32 / (18 + 14) = 0.65 or approximately 65%  Therefore, there are approximately 65% of red beads in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red beans, so we can write down 5R = 5 x 1 = 5.  Next, we have 14 yellow beans, which means we can write down 14Y = 14 x 2 = 28. Finally, we have 6 green beans, which gives us 6G = 6 x 3 = 18. So, the total number of beans is 5 + 28 + 18 = 61. Therefore, there are 61 zen and 61 yellows beans in the basket.
Response:  We have 65 košar (baskets). In each basket, we have 7 red beads and 3 green beads. So, the total number of beads in one basket is: 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, there are 65 x 10 = 650 beads in all the baskets together.
Response:  We have 11 coats and each coat has 10 red beads and 18 green beads. So, we can calculate the total number of beads as follows: Total number of red beads = 10 x 11 = 110Total number of green beads = 18 x 11 = 208Therefore, there are 110 + 208 = 318 beads in all 11 coats together.
Response:  We have 6 košar (baskets). In each basket, we have 16 red beans and 18 green beans. So, altogether we have:  Red beans = 16 x 6 = 96 Green beans = 18 x 6 = 108 Therefore, there are 96 rdečih breskev (red beans) in total.
"Response:  We have 7 košar (baskets). In each basket, we have 10 red beans and 2 green beans. So, altogether we have:

7 košar x 10 red beans/košar = 70 red beans
7 košar x 2 green beans/košar = 14 green beans
Total number of beans = 70 + 14 = 84 beans. Therefore, there are 84 zelenk (green beans) in total."
Response:  We have 10 košaric (Tam). In each košariček there are 4 red apples and 3 green apples. So, we have altogether 4 x 10 = 40 red apples and 3 x 10 = 30 green apples. Since we have 7 apples in total, the number of košarici must be equal to 7 / (4 + 3) = 7/10. Therefore, there are 7 košarici with apples.
Response:  We know that there are two coats (košari) and each coat has four red apples and some green apples. So, if we multiply the number of coats by the number of apples per coat, we get: Number of red apples = 4 x 2 = 8 Number of green apples =? Now, let's use the information given in the question to find out how many green apples there are in total. We know that there are 12 apples in all, and since each coat has both red and green apples, we can conclude that there are 3 green apples for every 4 red apples. Therefore, the number of green apples is: Number of green apples = 3 x 8 = 24 So, there are 24 green apples in total.
Response:  We know that there are 16 beads in the basket and we have already counted 13 red beads. So, there must be 3 more beads of some other color (green). Therefore, there are 3 green beads in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red beads and 4 green beads in each of the 15 baskets. Therefore, the total number of red beads is 19 x 15 = 285, and the total number of green beads is 4 x 15 = 60. So, the answer to the question is 285 red beads and 60 green beads.
Response:  If each bag has 10 beans and there are 5 bags, then the total number of red beans is 5 x 4 = 20. The total number of green beans is also 5 x 6 = 30. So, there are 20 red beans and 30 green beans in all the bags together.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green beans, which means we have 6/1 = 6 of them in total. Then, we know that there are 60 red beans and 2 red beans, so we can write this as 60 + 2 = x, where x is the number of red beans. Now, we want to find out how many more green beans than red beans there are. So, we divide the number of green beans (6) by the number of red beans (x): 6 / x =?  Solution: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, dividing both sides of the equation by 6 gives us: x = 6 × 60 = 360. Therefore, there are 360 red beans in the basket. Since each red bean represents twice as much space as a green bean, the total volume of green beans in the basket is 6 × 360 = 2160 cubic centimeters.
Response:  Jerry had four action figures on his desk initially. He later added some more action figures to the desk. If he has eight action figures now, that means he must have added at least four more action figures to the initial four. So, the total number of action figures Jerry added is 4 + 4 = 8.
Response:  If Jerry had some action figures on his desk initially and then added 7 more later, we can find out how many he had in total using the following steps:  Initially, Jerry had x action figures on his desk. Later, he added 7 more, so now he has x + 7. To find out exactly how many action figures Jerry had, we need to divide the total number of action figures by 2 (since there are two parts to the problem). Therefore, the final answer is: x = 5. So, Jerry had 5 action figures on his desk initially and then added 7 more, making it a total of 12 action figures.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had on his shelf is:  Initially, Jerry had 4 x 1 = 4 action figures. Then, he added 6 new action figures, bringing the total number to:  Total number of action figures = 4 + 6 = 10 action figures. Therefore, Jerry had 10 action figures on his shelf at the end.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 5 + 9 = 14 items on the shelf. After adding the new action figures, the total number of items on the shelf became 14 + 7 = 21. Therefore, there are now 21 items on Jerry's shelf, including both books and action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had two action figures and ten books on his shelf. Later, he added four more action figures to the shelf. So, initially, Jerry had 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on his shelf. Now, let's count how many books he had before adding the new action figures: 10 - 6 = 4 books. Therefore, after adding the new action figures, Jerry had 6 + 4 = 10 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 10 books to the collection. So, the total number of books Jerry had on his shelf is:  Initially, Jerry had 9 books + later, he added 10 more books = Total number of books Jerry had on his shelf = 9 + 10 = 19 books
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, initially there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. After adding the new books, the total number of items on the shelf became 9 + 4 = 13. Therefore, there were 13 - 7 = 6 action figures left on the shelf after Jerry added the new books.
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his desk initially. Later, he added 9 more books to the pile. So, the total number of items on the desk is: 5 + 2 + 9 = 16. Therefore, there were 16 items on Jerry's desk more than action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had eight action figures on his desk. Later, he added four more and removed five old ones. So, at the end of this process, Jerry had how many action figures on his desk?  We can use the information given in the question to calculate the number of action figures that Jerry had on his desk after adding new ones and removing old ones.  Firstly, we know that Jerry started with eight action figures. Then, he added four more, which means he now has twelve action figures (8 + 4 = 12). Finally, he removed five old ones, leaving him with seven action figures (12 - 5 = 7) on his desk. Therefore, the correct answer is seven.
Response:  Jerry had three action figures at first and then added four more later. So, he has six action figures now. To find out how many he removed, we need to subtract the number of old ones from the total number of new ones. In this case, there were three old ones (the ones he already had), plus four new ones, for a total of seven action figures. Therefore, Jerry removed one action figure.
Response:  Jerry had seven action figures on his shelf initially. He added some new ones and removed ten old ones. So, if he has eight action figures now, that means he added three new ones (since there were only seven original). Therefore, Jerry added three new action figures to his collection.
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures on his desk. Later, he added two more action figure and removed seven old ones. If he has ten action figures on his desk now, that means he had three new action figures and four old ones removed, right? So, to find out how many action figures Jerry had at first, we can subtract the number of new action figures (three) from the total number of action figures he has now (ten):  Ten - Three = Seven. Therefore, Jerry had seven action figures on his desk when he started adding or removing others.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 action figures on his desk. Then he added 7 more action figures to the desk. So, in total, Jerry has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on his desk. Now, let's find out how many books Jerry has on his desk. According to the question, Jerry also has 10 books on his desk. Therefore, we can conclude that for every 1 book on Jerry's desk, there are 16 / 10 = 1.6 action figures on his desk. So, if Jerry has 10 books on his desk, then he must have 10 x 1.6 = 16 action figures on his desk.
Response:  At first, Jerry had three books and four action figures on his desk. Later, he added two more action figure toys to the desk. So, how many action figures were there on the desk altogether?  We can count them as follows:  Books: 3 Action figures: 4 + 2 = 6 Therefore, there were six action figures on Jerry's desk in total.
Response:  Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures at home initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures to his collection. So, the total number of items Jerry had is: 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, Jerry had 10 things at home - action figures (2) and books (7).
Response:  If there were initially two birds sitting on the fence and then more birds came, let's say three more, then the total number of birds on the fence would be: 2 + 3 = 5 birds. So, out of these five birds, six birds are sitting on the fence if we include the initial two birds that were already there. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  At first, there were four birds on the fence. Then, five more birds came. So, in total, there are nine birds now (4 + 5 = 9). Therefore, at the beginning, there were four birds.
Response:  We know that there are four birds and 40 sparrows initially. Then six more birds join them. So, the total number of birds is: 4 + 6 = 10 birds. Therefore, there are ten birds on the fence.
Response:  We have three storks sitting on the fence in two shifts. So, we have 3 + 2 = 5 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 4 storks sitting on the fence and then 2 more birds come. So, there are now 6 birds in total - 4 storks + 2 additional birds = 6 birds. Therefore, there are 6 birds on the fence more than the number of storks (4).
Response:  We have two birds and six sparrows initially. When three more birds arrive, we now have five birds (including the original two) and nine sparrows (including the initial six). Therefore, there are four times as many sparrows as birds on the fence - 9 / 5 = 180%.
Response:  We have four birds and six sparrows initially. Then two more sparrows come. So, we need to find out how many sparrows are sitting on the fence now. The total number of sparrows = Initial number of sparrows + Number of new sparrows = 6 + 2 = 8 sparrows sit on the fence. Therefore, there are eight sparrows sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We have three trips of birds sitting on four fences. If six more birds join them, then we will have: 3 x 4 = 12 birds + 6 = 18 birds. So, there are 18 birds and 6 fences (or ""štorkov"") sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have six birds sitting on three fences = 6 x 3 = 18 birds. Then two more sparrows come = 2 + 18 = 20 birds. So there are more birds than sparrows on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds and three sparrows initially. If six sparrows join them, then we have: Birds - 4 Sparrows - 3 Total - 7 Now, if there are more than seven sparrows joining them, it would be an impossible situation as there wouldn't be enough space for all of them to fit around the perimeter of the area. Therefore, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  We have six birds sitting on the fence initially. Then four more birds come and join them. Finally, eight sparrows arrive. So, the total number of birds on the fence is: 6 + 4 = 10 + 8 = 18 birds. Therefore, there are 18 birds on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence initially (Dve ptiči). Then five more birds come (Prišlo jim je še pet ptic), so now we have seven birds in total (sedem ptič). However, there are also four starlings (štorkli), so the total number of birds and starlings combined is seven + four = eleven (ena deset). Therefore, there are eleven birds and starlings on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and two pigeons already on the fence. If we add six more sparrows, then there will be a total of nine small birds (three + two + six = nine). So, there are more sparrows than birds on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
"Response:  We have:
Pet Štorklov (4) + Tri Ptice (3) = Total of birds on fence = 7
So there are more birds than storks on the fence."
Response:  We have six storks and two birds sitting on the fence initially. Then three more birds arrive. So, we have six storks + two birds = eight creatures total. Therefore, there are four times as many storks as birds on the fence (8 - 2 = 6).
Response:  We have three storks and two birds that joined them. So, we have a total of 3 + 2 = 5 creatures on the fence.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many pages are in each of the two chapters. According to the question, the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the book (which is given as 300), we get: 300 - 11 = 289 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has more than 289 pages.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many pages are in total in the book. According to the question, there are two chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. So, if the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages, then together they make up 117 pages (37 + 80). Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the number of pages in the first chapter is 69 pages (80 - 37).
Response:  If the first chapter has 60 pages and there are 93 pages in total, then we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  If the book has two chapters and the second chapter is 36 pages long, then the first chapter must be shorter than that.  Therefore, we can conclude that the number of pages in the first chapter is equal to 67 - 36 = 31 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the book has three chapters. Then, we are given that the first chapter is 66 pages long, the second chapter is 35 pages long, and the third chapter is 24 pages long. To find out how many pages the entire book has, we can simply add up the number of pages in each chapter: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book has 125 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the book has three chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. We are given that the first chapter is 91 pages long, the second chapter is 23 pages long, and the third chapter is 25 pages long. To find out how many pages the first chapter is longer than the second chapter, we can subtract the length of the second chapter from the length of the first chapter: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter is 68 pages longer than the second chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the book has three chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. Therefore, if the first chapter has 35 pages, the second chapter must have fewer than 35 pages because there are only two chapters in total. Similarly, since the third chapter has only 3 pages, it cannot be equal to or greater than the number of pages in the second chapter. So, the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the number of pages in the third chapter is:  Second chapter - Third chapter = 18 - 3 = 15 pages.  Therefore, the second chapter has 15 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the book has three chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. Therefore, if the first chapter has 53 pages, then it must be longer than the third chapter which has only 21 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages in the first chapter and the third chapter is 53 - 21 = 32 pages. Hence, the first chapter has more than 32 pages.
Response:  If each chapter has 61 pages and there are 31 chapters in total, then the total number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1861 pages.
Response:  If knjiga has two chapters and each chapter is on 23 pages, then...  First chapter = 23 x 10 = 230 pages So, in the first chapter, there are 230 pages.
Response:  If the book has two chapters and each chapter is on 81 pages, then the total number of pages in the book is:  Pages = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter  In this case, if there are two chapters and each chapter is on 81 pages, then the total number of pages in the book is:  Pages = 2 x 81 = 162 pages  So, the second chapter starts at page 68 (since it is the second chapter) and ends at page 162 (the last page of the book).
Response:  We know that 62 campers went fishing yesterday morning and 39 campers fished in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation: 62 + 39 = x, where x is the number of campers who fished both morning and afternoon. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 39 from both sides of the equation: 62 - 39 = x. Simplifying, we get: x = 23. Therefore, there were 23 campers who fished both morning and afternoon.
Response:  We know that 52 campers went sailing in the morning and 61 campers went sailing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Morning = 52. Afternoon = 61 - 52 = 9. Now, to find out how many more campers went sailing in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of campers who went sailing in the morning from the total number of campers who went sailing in the afternoon: Number of campers who went sailing in the afternoon minus number of campers who went sailing in the morning = 9. Therefore, there were 9 more campers who went sailing in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 15 kampirjev went out to row in the morning and more than half of them (32 - 15 = 17) went out to row in the afternoon. So, we can conclude that 17 kampirjev went out to row in the afternoon.
"Response:  If there were 7 campers in the morning and 60 campers in the evening, then the number of campers during the day must be half of the total number of campers (since there are only 14 hours in a day). So, if there were X campers during the day, we can write an equation as follows:
X = (7 + 60) / 2 = 63 / 2 = 31
Therefore, there were 31 campers in the morning."
Response:  In the morning, 36 campers were rowing. Then, in the afternoon, 13 campers continued to row. Finally, at night, an additional 49 campers joined them for a total of 82 campers (36 + 13 + 49). Therefore, the answer is 82 campers.
Response:  We know that 44 kampirjeveslo zjutraj and 39 kampirjev popoldne. So, we need to find out how many more kampirjev veslo zjutraj than popoldne. To do this, we can subtract the number of kampirjev that veslo popoldne from the number of kampirjev that veslo zjutraj:  Number of kampirjev that veslo zjutraj - Number of kampirjev that veslo popoldne = 44 - 39 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more kampirjev that veslo zjutraj than popoldne.
Response:  We know that 53 kampirjeveslo zjutraj and 48 kampirjev popoldne. So, if we subtract 48 from 53, we get 7 (53 - 48 = 7). Therefore, 7 more kampirjev vesla zjutraj than at night.
Response:  We know that 33 people rowed in the morning, and 34 people rowed in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who rowed during the day is: 33 + 34 = 67. Now, we are asked how many people rowed in the evening as compared to those who rowed in the afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of people who rowed in the evening and those who rowed in the afternoon is: 67 - 34 = 33. So, there were 33 people who rowed in the evening.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went fishing and 59 campers went for a hike in the morning. This means that 46 campers (13 + 59) did not go fishing or hiking in the morning. Therefore, among those who did not go fishing or hiking in the morning, 21 campers must have been vesling. So, the number of campers who were vesling is 21.
Response:  We know that 29 campers went fishing and 66 campers went for a hike in the morning. This means that 37 campers (29 + 66) did not go fishing or hiking in the morning. Therefore, among those who did not go fishing or hiking in the morning, 26 campers were sailing in the afternoon. So, the number of campers who sailed in the afternoon is 26.
Response:  We know that 41 kampirjev (k) went fishing and 4 of them (k) went for a walk in the morning. So, the total number of kampirjev who did not go fishing is 41 - 4 = 37.  Among these 37 kampirjev, 26 (26/37) went fishing in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of kampirjev who went fishing is 26 + 4 = 30.  Finally, we have 4 kampirjev who went for a walk in the morning but did not go fishing. So, the total number of kampirjev who went for a walk is 4.
Response:  We know that 43 campers were rowing in the morning and some more campers were rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation:  Number of campers rowing in the afternoon = Total number of campers - Number of campers rowing in the morning. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of campers = 46 (as mentioned in the question) Number of campers rowing in the morning = 43 (as mentioned in the question) Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: Number of campers rowing in the afternoon = 46 - 43 = 3 Therefore, there were 3 additional campers rowing in the afternoon beyond those who rowed in the morning.
Response:  If Rachel took 4 apples from the tree and there were originally 7 apples on the tree, then there are now 3 apples left on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples still on the tree.
Response:  We know that there were initially 4 apples on the tree and after Rachel picked some of them, she left 2 apples on the tree. So, if Rachel picked x apples, then we can write an equation as follows: 4 - x = 2. Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do it?
Response:  If Rachel has taken 7 ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has 5 remaining apples, then we can conclude that there were initially 12 apples (7 + 5). So, the number of unripe apples is equal to 12 - 7 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 non-ripe apples left on the tree.
Response:  If Rachel took two ripe apples from the tree and now the tree has 7 apples left, then initially there were 6 + 2 = 8 apples on the tree. So, the number of ripe apples was 6.
Response:  We know that Rachel took six mature apples from the tree and now has two mature apples and four immature ones left on the tree. So, initially there were 6 + 2 = 8 apples on the tree. Therefore, the number of apples on the tree was 8.
Response:  We know that Rachel took three ripe apples from the tree and now there are two ripe apples left on the tree plus 27 unripe ones. So, the total number of apples on the tree is: 2 + 27 = 39 apples. Since Rachel took three ripe apples, we can conclude that there were 39 - 3 = 36 unripe apples on the tree before she took them. Therefore, the number of ripe apples on the tree is 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel took 7 apples from the tree and then two new apples grew on the tree. So, at first, there were 7 + 2 = 9 apples on the tree. Now, we are told that there are still 6 apples on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples that Rachel took was 9 - 6 = 3.
Response:  We know that initially there were two apples on the tree. Then, someone picked four apples from the tree. So, after picking, there were two apples left on the tree. Finally, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree now is: 2 + 4 - 3 = 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel had 52 apples in total and she picked two of them. So, she has 50 apples left. Now, we are told that she took one apple from each of her seven trees. Therefore, she has taken 7 x 1 = 7 apples in total. So, after taking those apples, she has 50 - 7 = 43 apples left.
"Response:  Rachel picked 8 j... (read more)

Rachel has three apple trees. From each tree, she picked 8 apples. Now, there are 9 apples on one of the trees. How many apples were there on all the trees at the beginning?

Let's think step by step.
Rachel picked 8 apples from each of her 3 trees, so in total, she picked 24 apples.
Now, there are 9 apples on one of the trees, which means that there were 9 - 24 = 15 apples on the other two trees at the beginning."
Response:  If Rachel took four apples from each tree and each tree had seven apples, then she took 4 x 7 = 28 apples in total. Since there are now 29 apples on one of the trees, that means Rachel must have taken one apple from that tree. So, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We know that Ed has 20 more balls than Doug. So if Doug had x balls initially, then Ed had x + 20 balls initially. Since Ed lost some of his balls during the game, he now has fewer balls than he initially had. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 20 = (x + 20) - y
where y is the number of balls Ed lost during the game. Solving for x, we get:
x = 13
So Doug initially had 13 balls and lost some of them during the game. The exact number of balls he lost is not given in the problem, but since Ed lost 5 balls, we can infer that Doug must have lost at least 8 balls (since Ed lost 5 and Doug had 13 initial balls). Thus, Doug lost 8 balls during the game."
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 10 pieces of candy than Doug. If Ed had 45 candies and lost 11 balls on the field, then he must have started with at least 34 candies (45 - 11 = 34). So, Ed had more than 34 candies than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had six more koščki than Doug and he lost seven balls on the field. So, if Ed had 22 koščki initially, then after losing those balls, his remaining number of koščki would be: 22 - 7 = 15. Therefore, Doug has 15 koščki now.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than Doug and lost three balls on the field. So, if Ed had x koščkov, then he would have left with x - 3 koščkov after losing the balls. Since Doug had fewer koščkov than Ed, we can say that Doug had (x - 3) / 2 = 19 koščkov. Therefore, Doug had 19 koščkov.
"Response:  We know that Ed had more than 24 chips than Doug. So, if Ed had x chips and Doug had 24 chips, then we can write an equation:
x > 24
Now, we are told that Doug lost 27 balls on the field, which means he has fewer balls than before. So, let's subtract 27 from his total number of balls to find out how many balls he has left:
Doug = x - 27
We also know that Ed found 9 additional balls on the field, so we can add them to Doug's remaining balls:
Ed = Doug + 9
Now, we have two equations:
Doug = x - 27
Ed = Doug + 9
Can you solve these equations to find out how many more balls Ed had than Doug?"
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 29 balls (he had 36). And he lost 17 balls on the field. So, Ed had 36 - 17 = 19 balls left. Therefore, Ed had 19 more balls than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has 19 balls more than Doug. So, if Doug had x balls, then Ed would have 19 + x balls. Since Ed lost some of his balls on the field, he now has fewer balls than before. Let's call the number of balls Ed had after losing some as y. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: 19 = x - y (Ed has 19 more balls than Doug) 8 = y (Ed has 8 more balls than Doug does) Now we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract y from both sides of the first equation: 19 - y = x Solving for x, we get: x = 11 (Ed has 11 more balls than Doug) Finally, since Ed has 8 more balls than Doug, and Ed has 11 more balls than Doug, we can conclude that Ed has 8 + 11 = 19 more balls than Doug. Therefore, Ed lost 10 balls (19 - 8 = 10).
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 30 pieces of candy (he had 30 + 21 = 51). So, if Ed had 91 candies in total, then he must have had at least 40 more candies than Doug (since Doug only had 30). Therefore, Ed had 91 - 40 = 51 candies more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more koščki than Doug initially. So if Ed has X koščekov and Doug has Y koščekov, we can write an equation: X = Y + 12. Now, we are told that Ed lost 20 Žogic on the field. This means that his new number of koščki is less by 20. Therefore, we can write another equation: X - 20 = Y + 12. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get: X = 38 and Y = 16. So, Doug currently has 16 koščekov.
Response:  If there are 408 students who have suggested adding pirates and only 42 students who have suggested adding saltiness to the menu, then we can say that the number of students who have suggested adding pirates is greater than the number of students who have suggested adding saltness to the menu. So, the answer would be 408 - 42 = 366. Therefore, more than three-fourths (or 75%) of the students have suggested adding pirates to the menu.
Response:  If 479 students have suggested adding pira and 489 students have suggested adding saltine, then we can say that the number of students who have suggested adding saltine is greater than the number of students who have suggested adding pira. So, the answer is 489 - 479 = 10 more students have suggested adding saltine than pire.
Response:  If 185 students have suggested adding pepper to potatoes (which is already a common combination), then we can assume that most of these students would also suggest adding salt to their food. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding salt should be close to the total number of students who answered the survey minus the number of students who suggested adding pepper to potatoes.  Using this reasoning, we can estimate that around 160-170 students (out of 310) suggested adding salt to their food.
Response:  If 264 students have suggested adding salt and 20 students have suggested adding pepper to the menu, then we can say that 264 + 20 = 284 students have made suggestions for the menu. So, out of these 284 students, 264 have suggested adding salt, which means that 10 (264 - 20) students have suggested adding pepper. Therefore, the number of students who have suggested adding pepper is 10.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding potatoes to pasta and 63 students suggested adding cheese to pasta, then we can conclude that 63/457 = x, where x is the number of students who suggested adding cheese to pasta. Since there are 100% students in total (457 + 63), we have: 100% = x/457, which simplifies to x = 14%. Therefore, 14% of the students suggested adding cheese to pasta.
Response:  If 182 students proposed adding potatoes to their menu and 166 of them proposed adding salt, then we can say that 166 - 182 = 16 students did not propose adding any new food item. Therefore, the number of students who proposed adding kale is 182 - 16 = 166.
Response:  If 324 students proposed adding potatoes to the menu, and 374 students proposed adding salted foods, then together they have proposed 698 different types of food (324 + 374 = 698). Since there are only 128 students who proposed adding peppers, we can conclude that 560 students did not propose any new food items (698 - 128 = 560). Therefore, 560 students participated in proposing new food items.
Response:  If 257 students suggested adding potatoes to their meal and 120 students suggested adding saltine crackers, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding saltine crackers. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is greater than 120.  Therefore, the answer is (more than 120).
Response:  If 144 students have suggested adding pirates and 467 students have suggested adding saltine crackers, then there are more students who suggest adding pirates than those who suggest adding saltine crackers (144 > 467). Similarly, if 79 students have suggested adding radishes and 467 students have suggested adding saltine crackers, then there are more students who suggest adding radishes than those who suggest adding saltine crackers (79 < 467). Therefore, the number of students who suggest adding pirates is greater than the number of students who suggest adding radishes.
Response:  If 337 students have proposed adding salt and only 23 students have proposed adding peppers, then there are more students who want to add salt than those who want to add peppers. So, the number of students who want to add salt is greater than the number of students who want to add peppers. Therefore, the answer is 337 - 23 = 314.
Response:  We know that out of 450 students, 45 (or 10%) have suggested adding pir. Therefore, there are 405 students who did not suggest adding pir.  Among these 405 students, we also know that 38 students have suggested adding saltine. So, the number of students who have suggested adding saltine is 38/405 = 9%.  Finally, since the remaining 377 students did not suggest adding either pir or saltine, they constitute 377/405 = 92% of the total students.
Response:  If 218 students have suggested adding potatoes and salt, then there are 351 - 218 = 133 students who have not suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, among these 133 students, 35 (or 1/4) have suggested adding only salt to their meals. So, the number of students who have suggested adding salt is 35.
Response:  If 269 students have suggested adding salt, and 330 students have suggested adding pepper to potatoes, then there are more students who suggest adding pepper than those suggesting adding salt. So, the number of students who suggest adding pepper is greater than the number of students suggesting adding salt. Therefore, the answer is (greater than).
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many boys have more than 50, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 34 from 841, we get 796. Therefore, there are 796 boys who have more than 50 in the school.
Response:  If there are 232 girls and 485 students in total, then the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 students in total and 228 of them are girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of boys = 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 boys in the school. To find out how many boys are in the school, we can divide the number of boys by the total number of students (girls + boys):  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 510 / 635  Number of boys = 82 So, there are 82 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 281 more than boys, then the total number of students is: 868 + (281 - 868) = 868 + (-193) = 675. Therefore, there are 675 students in this school.
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, then the total number of students is: 700 + (142 - 70) = 912. Therefore, there are 912 students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in school. If 418 girls attend school, then we can calculate the number of non-attending girls as follows: Number of non-attending girls = Total number of girls - Number of attending girls = 706 - 418 = 288 Non-attending girls now make up half of the total number of students in the school, which is 706 + 288 = 994 students. Therefore, there are 994 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 902 girls and 811 boys attending school. If 44 more girls start attending school, then we have to add this number to the total number of girls already attending school. So, the new total number of girls attending school is: 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, there are 946 girls attending school.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys attending school initially. Then, another 465 girls start attending school. To find out how many more girls than boys attend school, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls who started attending school:  Number of girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 Number of boys = 410 Therefore, there are 687 more girls than boys attending school (1097 - 410).
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in school. So far so good! Then we learn that another 682 girls started attending school. Now let's calculate how many girls are already in school plus those who just joined: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls in total. Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 496 girls attending school and 910 boys attending school. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of boys = 910 - 496 = 414. Therefore, there are currently 414 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys at the school. So, if we add these numbers together, we get... (insert calculation)...which equals 626 učencev!
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers. There are 772 teachers in the school, so the total number of people in the school is 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people in this school.
Response:  If there are 402 girls in school and 739 students in total, then the number of boys is equal to 739 - 402 = 337. Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 458 girls and 692 students in total, then the number of boys is:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls So, we can write: Boys = 692 - 458 = 234 Now, we know that there are 234 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls at school. If 403 girls started attending school, then we can calculate the difference between the number of girls who started attending school and the total number of girls as follows: Number of girls starting = 403 - 257 = 146 girls. Therefore, the number of more girls than boys is 146.
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. So, Edward has $2 now.
Response:  If Edward had $13 and spent some of it, he now has $3. So, he must have spent $10 ( $13 - $3 = $10).
Response:  Edward had $9 initially and then he spent $8 more, so he has $9 + $8 = $17 now. Therefore, Edward had $9 before spending any money.
Response:  If Edward had $16 and spent it all on books that cost him $9 each, then he would have bought 16/9 = 1.77 books. Since he has $6 left after buying those books, we can calculate how many books he originally had as follows: Number of books originaly owned = Total amount of money - Amount spent = $16 - (1.77 x $9) = $16 - $15.83 = $0.17 So, Edwar...
Response:  If Edward spent $6 for two books that cost him equally (i.e., each book cost him $\$3$), then he has $6 - \$3 = \$3$ left after buying the first book. Now, when he bought the second book, he had only $\$3$ left, so the second book must have cost him $\$3$. Therefore, the total amount of money Edward spent is $\$3 + \$3 = \$6$, which means that each book costs him $\$2$. So, one book costs $\$2$.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward had 6 dollars for books and 16 dollars for pens. So, his total amount of money was: 6 + 16 = 22 dollars. Now, he spent 19 dollars, so he had: 22 - 19 = 3 dollars left. Therefore, Edward had 3 dollars before he spent any money.
Response:  Edward spent 4 dollars on books and 3 dollars on pens. So he has 12 dollars now. To find out how much he spent on books, we can divide the amount of money he had before buying anything (4 dollars) by the price of one book (1 dollar). This gives us 4 books. Similarly, to find out how much he spent on pens, we can divide the amount of money he had after buying something (9 dollars) by the price of one pen (3 dollars), which also gives us 3 pens. Therefore, Edward spent 4 dollars on books and 3 dollars on pens.
Response:  Edward had $16 for books and spent $8 on pens. So he has $16 - $8 = $8 left. Now he has $8 + $1 (the additional amount he spent) = $9. Therefore, Edward spent more money on books than on pens.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $17 dollars and then he spent $10 dollars of it which means that now he has $7 dollars left. So, Edward initially had $17 dollars.
Response:  We know that Zachary has made 44 exercises and David has made 58 more than Zachary. So, if we add both numbers together, we get: 44 + 58 = 102. Therefore, Zachary and David have made altogether 102 exercises.
Response:  We know that Zachary has 51 skleks and David has 44 skleks. So we can write an equation as follows:  Zachary = 51 - 44. Now we need to solve for Zachary. To do this, we subtract 44 from both sides of the equation: 51 - 44 = Zachary. Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation gives us: 7 = Zachary. Therefore, Zachary has 7 skleks.
Response:  We know that David made 44 exercises and Zachary made fewer than 44 exercises. So, we can say that Zachary made x number of exercises where x is less than or equal to 44. Now, we are given that David made 9 more exercises than Zachary. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of exercises made by Zachary = x (x ≤ 44) + 9  In other words, Zachary made at least 35 exercises (since he made more than 0). So, the answer is 35.
Response:  We know that David has made 51 exercises and he did 49 better than Zachary. So, if they have done exercises together, then their total number of exercises will be more than 51 + 49 = 100. Therefore, Zachary and David have done 100 exercises together.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 shots and David made more than Zachary but less than Zachary. So, we can say that David made x shots where x is between 59 and 93 (the maximum number of shots). Now, we are given that David made 19 more shots than Zachary. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 19 = 93  Substituting the value of x from the previous equation into this one gives us: 59 + 19 = 93 Solving for x, we get:  x = 70  Therefore, David made 70 shots.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 boxes and David made 29 more than Zachary. So, David made 44 + 29 = 73 boxes. Therefore, David made 13 fewer boxes than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary made fewer skleks than David did. So, if David made 17 more skleks than Zachary, then Zachary must have made half of 17 = 8 skleks less than David. Therefore, Zachary made 53 - 8 = 45 skleks.
Response:  We know that Zachary has made more than half of all boxes (he made 35 out of 60). So if we subtract the number of boxes he made from the total number of boxes, we will get the number of boxes David made. Therefore, David made 25 boxes (60 - 35 = 25). Now, we are told that David made 87 fewer boxes than Zachary. This means that Zachary made 87 + 25 = 112 boxes. So, Zachary made 112 boxes.
"Response:  We know that Zachary made more than 46 boxes and less than 58 boxes. So, there must be some number between 46 and 58 that Zachary made. Let's call this number x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Zachary made x boxes.
David made 38 more boxes than Zachary.
So, David made (x + 38) boxes.
We are also told that David made 62 fewer boxes than Zachary.
So, the number of boxes made by David is equal to:

(x + 38) - 62 =?
Solving for x, we get:

x = 40
Therefore, Zachary made 40 boxes."
Response:  We know that David has done more than Zachary because he is given as having done 39 skleks instead of 19. So we can say that Zachary did x skleks and David did 39 - x skleks. Since John did fewer skleks than David, we can say that John did y skleks where y < 39. Now we have two equations:  x + y = 19 (from the fact that Zachary did some skleks) 39 - x = y (from the fact that John did fewer skleks than David). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 24 and y = 5. Therefore, David did 39 - 24 = 15 skleks more than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 push-ups and David has done more than Zachary. So, we can say that David has done at least 51 + 1 = 52 push-ups. Since John did fewer push-ups than David, he must have done 49 push-ups or less (since 49 is the minimum number of push-ups John could have done). Therefore, the correct answer is 52 - 49 = 3 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary has made 15 gym sessions and David has made 39 more than Zachary. So, David has made 54 sessions (39 + 15). Now we know that John has made 9 fewer sessions than David. Therefore, John has made 45 sessions (54 - 9 = 45). Finally, we want to find out how many sessions Zachary has made more than John. To do this, we subtract the number of sessions John has made from the number of sessions Zachary has made. So, Zachary has made 15 + 45 = 60 sessions more than John.
Response:  If David made 30 more push-ups than Zachary, that means Zachary did 30 - 30 = 0 push-ups. So, Zachary did 0 push-ups. Therefore, David did 37 push-ups (30 + 7).
Response:  We know that David made 56 exercises more than Zachary. So if David did 38 exercises, then Zachary did 18 exercises (56 - 38 = 18). Therefore, the total number of exercises done by both David and Zachary is 38 + 18 = 56.
Response:  We know that David has more than Zachary at the gym. So, if Zachary did 34 sets and David had more than him, then David must have done at least 35 sets (since he has more than Zachary). Therefore, David has done 35 or more sets than Zachary.
"Response:  If David has made more than 36 skleks at the gym and Zachary has made 58 skleks plus 33 skleks, then we can calculate how many skleks Zachary has made as follows:
Zachary's total number of skleks = 58 + 33 = 91
Therefore, Zachary has made 91 skleks at the gym."
Response:  If David has made more than 27 shots and Zachary has made 5 + 17 = 22 shots, then Zachary has made fewer shots than David. So, the answer is:  Zachary has made fewer than 27 shots.
Response:  Rachel had to correct 7 homework assignments from math and 4 from reading. So, she had more than 7 homework assignments from math. Therefore, the answer is 7.
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to correct 3 sides of homework from mathematics and 4 sides from reading. So, we can write an equation as follows: Mathematics = 3 + Reading = 4. Now, let's solve for ""Reading"": Reading = 4 - Mathematics = 4 - 3 = 1 Therefore, Rachel had more homework to do in reading than in mathematics."
"Response:  If Rachel had to correct 5 pages of homework from math and more than 7 pages for reading comprehension, then she had to correct a total of:

5 + (more than 7) = X pages

So, the answer is X pages."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 homework pages from math and she completed 4 more than her homework from reading, then the number of homework pages from reading that Rachel had to complete is:

7 - 4 = 3

So, Rachel had to complete 3 homework pages from reading."
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of homework from mathematics and she completed 3 more pages than her homework from reading, then the number of pages she had to complete is:

Pages from math homework = 8
Pages from reading homework = 3 + 8 = 11
Total pages to be completed = 11
Therefore, Rachel had to complete 11 pages of homework in total."
Response:  If Rachel had to correct 8 pages of homework for math and she did 6 more pages than for reading comprehension, then we can say that...  So, the number of pages Rachel had to correct for reading comprehension is 8 - 6 = 2 pages.
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 10 pages of homework in mathematics and she completed 3 more pages for reading than for mathematics, then we can say that:

Rachel completed 10/2 = 5 pages of homework in mathematics.
She completed 3 + 5 = 8 pages of homework overall (including both mathematics and reading)."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to correct two sides of homework from mathematics, three sides of homework from reading and 10 sides of homework from biology. So, we can write down the total number of sides as follows: Total = 2 + 3 + 10 = 15 sides of homework. Therefore, Rachel has to write 15 sides of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to correct 9 pages of homework from mathematics, and she also had to read 2 pages of homework from reading. However, we are not given how many pages of homework she had to correct from biology. So, let's assume that she had to correct an equal number of pages from each subject (mathematics, reading, and biology). Therefore, the total number of pages of homework Rachel had to correct is:  Mathematics: 9 pages + Reading: 2 pages = 11 pages Biology: Not given In this case, the number of pages of homework Rachel had to correct from mathematics is greater than the number of pages of homework she had to correct from reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to correct 11 pages of homework from mathematics, 2 pages of homework from reading and 3 pages of homework from biology. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Mathematics = 11 + Reading = 2 + Biology = 3. Now, let's solve for the number of pages of mathematics that Rachel had more than biology:  Number of pages of mathematics = 11 - 3 = 8 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 8 more pages of mathematics than biology.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to correct 7 pages of homework from mathematics, 11 pages of homework from reading and 8 pages of homework from biology. So, we can write down the total number of pages of homework as follows: Total = 7 + 11 + 8 = 26 pages. Therefore, there were more than 26 pages of homework in biology.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of homework from mathematics, so we can write it as follows:  Mathematics = 9. Now, let's find out how many pages she had to read for reading comprehension: According to the question, she had to complete 11 pages of homework from reading comprehension. Therefore, Reading Comprehension = 11. Finally, let's calculate the number of pages she had to complete from biology: As mentioned in the question, she had to complete 29 pages of homework from biology. So Biology = 29.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of homework from mathematics and 7 pages from reading. Therefore, she had to complete 8 + 7 = 15 pages of homework overall. However, we are also given that she completed 3 pages of homework from biology. So, out of the remaining 15 pages, she had to complete 15 - 3 = 12 pages of homework from mathematics and biology combined.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 10 pages of homework from reading and 6 pages of homework from biology. Since she also has to correct 5 pages of math homework, we can assume that each page of math homework takes her approximately half an hour to complete (since there are 24 minutes in an hour). Therefore, the total time it will take Rachel to complete all her homework is:
Time = Number of pages x Time per page
= 10 + 6 + 5 x 0.5
= 30 + 3 + 2.5
= 35.5 hours
So, Rachel needs to spend approximately 35.5 hours completing her homework."
Response:  Rachel had to complete 2 homework assignments for reading and 4 homework assignments for mathematics. So, the total number of homework assignments she had to complete is 6 (2 + 4). Therefore, more than half of her homework was related to mathematics (6/10 = 3/5).
Response:  We know that Rachel had to correct 4 pages of homework for reading and 7 pages of homework for mathematics.  So, she corrected a total of 4 + 7 = 11 pages of homework.  Now, we are asked how many more pages of math homework Rachel had than her reading homework. To find this, we subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework: 11 - 7 = 4 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 4 more pages of math homework than her reading homework.
Response:  Jack received six email messages in the morning and two in the afternoon. So, he received a total of eight emails (6 + 2 = 8). Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received six emails in the morning and eight in the evening. So, he received a total of 14 emails (6 + 8). Therefore, Jack received twice as many emails in the evening as he did in the morning.
Response:  Jack received four emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. If he received five emails that day, then he must have received one email in the afternoon. So, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is 1.
"Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 in the afternoon and 5 in the evening. So, he received a total of:

6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails that day."
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning (zjutraj), so he received 5 x 1 = 5 emails in the morning. He also received 8 emails in the evening (popoldne), so he received 8 x 1 = 8 emails in the evening. Therefore, Jack received a total of 5 + 8 = 13 emails.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails that morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the evening. According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 12 emails throughout the day (daytime + evening). Therefore, Jack received 12 emails in total.
Response:  Jack received three emails in the morning and four in the afternoon, so he received a total of 3 + 4 = 7 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning, which means he received 30 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). So, he received 30 - 7 = 23 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in total. So he received an average of 9/3 = 3 emails per time period (morning, afternoon, or evening). Therefore, Jack received more emails during the morning than any other time period.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 5 in the afternoon, and 4 in the evening. So, he received a total of 19 emails (10 + 5 + 4). Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, and more in the evening. So he received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails during the time period between midnight and midnight of the same day.
Response:  Jack received three emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 8 emails that day (3 + 5 = 8).
Response:  Jack received 5 email messages and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 11 messages (5 + 6 = 11). Then, he received 9 more email messages and 7 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 18 messages (9 + 7 = 18). Therefore, Jack received a total of 18 messages on that day (11 + 18 = 39).
Response:  Jack received 10 email messages in the morning and 3 more in the afternoon, so he received a total of 10 + 3 = 13 email messages during the day.
Response:  Jack received six email messages and eight letters yesterday. In the afternoon, he received two emails and seven letters. So, if we subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails he received yesterday, we get:  6 - 2 = 4 additional emails that Jack received yesterday compared to the morning. Similarly, if we subtract the number of letters he received in the afternoon from the total number of letters he received yesterday, we get:  8 - 7 = 1 more letter that Jack received yesterday compared to the morning. Therefore, Jack received four more emails and one more letter than he did in the morning.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails before sending 91 letters and then he got 2 more emails. So, the total number of emails he received is 6 + 2 = 8.  Now, after sending 74 letters in the afternoon, he has sent a total of 91 + 74 = 165 letters. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received that day is 8 - 165 = -157 emails.
Response:  Jack received four emails and sent two letters in the morning. Then he received six email messages and sent eight letters in the afternoon. So, Jack sent a total of 10 emails (4 + 2 = 6) and received 6 email messages (6). Therefore, Jack sent 4 emails on that day.
Response:  If Jack received 9 emails that day and he received 7 emails in the morning, then he received an additional 2 emails in the afternoon (since there are only 4 hours between the time he received the 7 am emails and the time he received the rest of the emails). Therefore, Jack received a total of 9 + 2 = 11 emails that day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received three emails after noon and five emails before noon. So he received eight emails in total (3 + 5 = 8). Therefore, Jack received more emails before noon than after noon.
Response:  Jack received three emails after noon, six in the morning, and more in the evening. If he received 10 email messages that day, then he must have received at least 3 + 6 = 9 email messages during the time period when he was awake (i.e., after noon). Therefore, Jack received at least 9 email messages during the afternoon/evening.
Response:  We know that Kobilica has skočila 9 inches and Žaba has skočila 12 inches. So we can write this as: Distance = 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, Žaba is 3 inches longer than Kobilica.
Response:  We know that Kobilica has jumped 31 inches and Žaba has jumped 35 inches. So, their total jump is: 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
"Response:  We know that: * Kobilica skočila 36 cm * Žaba skočila 17 cm dlje od kobilice * Miš skočila 15 cm dlje od žabe Now we can calculate how far away from kobilica was the point where the Žaba landed: Distance = Speed x Time + Initial position (in this case, initial position of kobilica) So, if we assume that all three animals had the same speed during their jump (let's call it ""v""), then we can calculate the distance traveled by each animal as follows: Kobilica: Distance = v x 36 cm = 360 cm Žaba: Distance = v x (17 cm - 36 cm) = 294 cm Miš: Distance = v x (15 cm - 36 cm) = 219 cm Since we are looking for the distance traveled by the Žaba, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the other two animals from the total distance traveled by the Žaba: Distance traveled by Žaba = Distance traveled by Žaba - Distance traveled by Kobilica - Distance traveled by Miš Substituting the values we have obtained above, we get: Distance traveled by Žaba = 294 cm - 360 cm - 219 cm = -61 cm This means that the Žaba landed closer to the starting point than any of the other two animals!"
Response:  We know that:  - Kobilica has jumped 25 cm (palces).  - Žaba has jumped 18 cm more than Kobilica (from the start point), so she has jumped 25 + 18 = 43 cm.  - Miš has jumped 2 cm less than Žaba (from her final position), so he has jumped 43 - 2 = 41 cm. Therefore, miš has jumped 41 cm away from the starting point.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kobilica skated 30 cm. Then, we are told that Žaba skated 10 cm further than Kobilica, so she skated 40 cm (30 + 10 = 40). Finally, we learn that Miš skated 20 cm further than Žaba, so he skated 60 cm (40 + 20 = 60). Therefore, Miš skated 20 cm farther from Kobilica than Žaba did.
"Response:  We know that:
Kobilica has jumped 30 cm.
Žaba has jumped 39 cm more than Kobilica (i.e., 39 + 30 = 69 cm).
Miš has jumped 94 cm less than Žaba (i.e., 94 - 69 = 25 cm).
So, the distance traveled by Žaba is equal to 69 cm."
"Response:  We know that:
Kobilica has jumped 25 cm.
Žaba has jumped 32 cm more than Kobilica (i.e., 32 + 25 = 57 cm).
Miš has jumped 26 cm less than Žaba (i.e., 57 - 26 = 31 cm).
Therefore, Miš has jumped 31 cm."
"Response:  We know that:
Kobilica skočila 24 palcev = 24 cm (since 1 palac is equal to 7.5 cm)
Žaba skočila 33 centimetra dlje od kobilice = 33 x 7.5 = 247.5 cm
Miš skočila 5 centimetrov manj kot žaba = -5 cm
So, we can calculate how far miš skočil from kobilica as follows:
miš skočila 247.5 - 5 = 242 cm
Therefore, miš skočila 242 cm away from kobilica."
Response:  We know that Kobilica has jumped 13 inches (or 33 cm) and Žaba has jumped 5 cm more than Kobilica. So, Žaba has jumped 18 cm (5 cm + 13 cm). Therefore, Žaba has jumped 18 cm away from the starting point.
Response:  We know that Kobilica has jumped 35 paces and Kobilica has jumped 10 cm further than Kobilica. So, if we calculate the distance traveled by both frogs together, it would be: Distance = (Kobilica's jump + Kobilica's additional jump) x Speed of light = (35 paces + 10 cm x speed of light / 29970 km/s) x 29970 km/s = 468.5 m x 29970 km/s = 137.6 million meters.
Response:  We know that:  - Kobilica has jumped 30 cm.  - Kobilica is 10 cm further than the frog (so she has jumped 40 cm).  - The mouse has jumped 20 cm less than the frog (so she has jumped 60 cm).  So, we can calculate the distance traveled by the frog as follows: Distance = Total distance + Additional distance = 40 cm + 10 cm = 50 cm Therefore, the frog has jumped 50 cm.
"Response:  We know that:
Kobilica has jumped 39 paces (cm).
Žaba has jumped 20 cm less than Kobilica.
Miš has jumped 30 cm less than Žaba.
From this information we can conclude that Miš has jumped 50 cm (30 - 20 = 50) less than Žaba. Therefore, Miš has jumped 15 cm (50 / 3 = 15) less than Kobilica. So Miš has jumped 44 cm (39 + 15 = 44) away from the starting point."
"Response:  We know that:
Kobilica skočila 21 palcev = 21 cm (since 1 palac is equal to 2.54 cm)
Kobilica skočila 25 cm dlje od žabe
Miška skočila 16 cm manj od žabe
So we can write an equation based on these statements:
Distance traveled by koblica = distance traveled by koblica + distance traveled by miš - distance traveled by zebra
Substituting values from the problem:
Distance traveled by koblica = 21 cm + 16 cm - 25 cm
= 30 cm
Therefore, kobilica skočila 30 cm dlje od miške."
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog is 39 cm and the distance traveled by the goose is 17 cm. So we can write an equation as follows: Distance = Frog + Goose (in cm)  Distance = 39 + 17 = 56 cm  Therefore, the frog has traveled 56 cm more than the goose.
Response:  We know that:  - Kobilica has jumped 15 cm.  - The distance between Kobilica and Žaba is 30 cm (since Žaba is farther away from Kobilica than Kobilica is from Miš).  - Miš has jumped less than 10 cm fewer than Žaba (the difference between their jumps). So, Miš has jumped 90 cm (since 10 cm fewer than 100 = 90). Therefore, Miš has jumped 90 cm.
"Response:  We know that:
Kobilica has jumped 15 cm.
Miš has jumped x cm less than Kobilica (since it is said that ""Miška je skočila 16 centimetrov manj kot žaba""). So Miš has jumped 15 - 16 = 9 cm.
Žaba has jumped 37 cm more than Kobilica (since it is said that "" Žaba je skočila 37 centimetrov več kot kobilica""). So Žaba has jumped 37 + 15 = 52 cm.
Therefore, Miš has jumped 9 cm and Žaba has jumped 52 cm."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of milk and needs to add more to make 14 cups in total. So, we can calculate how many cups she needs to add next as follows:

Total amount of milk needed = 14 cups
Amount of milk Mary has already added = 5 cups
Number of cups Mary needs to add next = Total amount of milk needed - Amount of milk Mary has already added
= 14 cups - 5 cups
= 9 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add 9 cups of milk next."
"Response:  We know that if we have x amount of milk and y amount of sugar is required to make the recipe, then we can calculate how much more sugar is needed as follows:

Sugar needed = Total amount of sugar required - Amount of milk available
= 11 skodelic sladkorja - 4 skodelice moke
= 7 skodelic sladkorja

So, there are 7 skodelics of sugar more than the amount of milk available in the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some sugar to the mixture and now she needs 8 more spoons of honey than the amount of sugar required for the recipe (which is 13 spoonfuls). So if we divide 13 by 2 (since each spoonful of sugar is equal to 2 teaspoonfuls of honey), we get:

13 / 2 = 6 + 8 = 14

Therefore, Mary needs to add 14 additional spoonfuls of honey to the mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some sugar to the mixture and now she needs 2 more tablespoons of honey than the amount of sugar she used. So if she used x tablespoons of sugar, then she needs 2x tablespoons of honey. Since there are 11 tablespoons in a cup, we can write this as:

Mary needs 2(11) = 22 tablespoons of honey.
Since one table spoon of honey is equal to 15 grams of honey, we can convert this to grams as follows:

Mary needs 22 x 15 = 330 grams of honey."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already used 3 skodl... (read more)

Solution: Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the number of skodls of sugar required for the recipe as follows:

Total amount of sugar needed = 11 skodlcs
Amount of sugar used so far = 3 skodlcs (already used by Mary)
Remaining amount of sugar needed = Total amount of sugar needed - Amount of sugar used so far
= 11 skodlcs - 3 skodlcs
= 8 skodlcs

Therefore, the recipe requires 8 skodlcs of sugar."
"Response:  If Mary has already added some sugar and needs 2 more cups of milk to complete the recipe, then she must have added x cups of milk so far. Since there are 12 cups of milk required for the recipe, we can set up an equation as follows:
x + 2 = 12
Now, let's solve for x. We know that x is the number of cups of milk that Mary has already added, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
x + 2 = 12
Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:
x = 10
Therefore, Mary has added 10 cups of milk so far."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of milk and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of milk she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount needed for the recipe (9 cups). So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of milk to her recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 skittle of honey and 2 skittles of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more skittles of sugar she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required for the recipe. So, if the recipe requires 14 skittles of sugar and she has already used 10 skittles, then she needs an additional 4 skittles (14 - 10 = 4).
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 cups of milk and we have given 11 cups so far. So, to find out how many more cups of milk are needed, we can subtract the number of cups we have given from the total amount required:

12 cups - 11 cups = 1 cup
So, Mary needs to add one more cup of milk to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 10 cups of flour and we have given 7 cups so far. To find out how many more cups of flour are needed, we can subtract the number of cups we have given from the total amount required: 10 - 7 = 3 cups. So, we need 3 additional cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has given away 2 cups of sugar and needs 12 - 2 = 10 cups of sugar to make the cake recipe. Similarly, we need 14 - 2 = 12 cups of salt for the same recipe. Now, since she already gave away 2 cups of milk, we are left with 9 cups of milk required for the recipe. So, the number of cups of milk more than the number of cups of salt needed is 9 - 12 = -3 cups. Therefore, there are -3 cups of milk more than the number of cups of salt needed.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of sugar to her recipe, which means she needs an additional 3 cups (since the recipe calls for 8 cups total). Now, we also know that there are 7 cups of salt needed, so Mary needs to add 4 more cups of salt (since she has already used 1 cup). Therefore, the final amount of salt required is 4 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given two cups of sugar (16/2 = 8). So we need to find out how many more cups she needs to give. To do this, we divide the total number of cups required for the recipe (12) by the number of cups Mary has already given (8): 12 / 8 = 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, Mary still needs three cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has given 4 skodelices of sugar and the recipe requires 6 skodelices of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more skodelices of milk are needed than skodelices of sugar.  Therefore, the number of skodelices of milk required is: 6 - 4 = 2 skodelices of milk.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of milk.  Mary has already given 2 cups of milk. So, we need to find out how many more cups of milk are needed to make up for the difference between the required amount of sugar and the amount of milk provided by Mary. To do this, we can divide the required amount of sugar (6 cups) by the amount of milk provided by Mary (2 cups): 6 / 2 = 3. Therefore, Mary needs to provide an additional 3 cups of milk to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has given 11 skodelics of honey and the recipe requires 14 skodelics of honey. So we can calculate how many skodelics of sugar are needed as follows:
Sugar required = Honey required - Honey given
= 14 - 11
= 3
So, Mary needs to give 3 more skodelics of sugar than she gave of honey to make the torto according to the recipe."
Response:  If Mary has already added some sugar and still needs 5 more spoons of honey than she has given, then we can calculate it as follows:  Number of spoonfuls of honey needed = Total amount of honey required - Amount of honey already given So, if the total amount of honey required is 10 spoonfuls (as mentioned in the problem) and Mary has already given 3 spoonfuls (also mentioned), then the number of spoonfuls of honey needed would be: Number of spoonfuls of honey needed = 10 - 3 = 7 spoonfuls Therefore, Mary needs 7 additional spoonfuls of honey to complete the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has already added some sugar and still needs 12 spoons of honey to complete the recipe, then we can calculate how many spoons she initially added using the following formula: Total amount of sugar = Initial amount + Amount needed for recipe Total amount of honey = Initial amount + Amount needed for recipe Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Total amount of sugar = 5 + 13 = 18 Total amount of honey = 5 + 12 = 17 Since Mary has already added 18 spoons of sugar and still needs 17 spoons of honey to finish the recipe, that means she initially added 18 / 2 = 9 spoons of sugar. Therefore, Mary has added 9 spoons of sugar so far.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 skodelics of honey and 60 skodelics of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more skodelics of honey she needs to add, we can use the following equation: Number of skodelics of honey needed = Total amount of honey required - Amount of honey already added / Amount of sugar already added x 100 So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of skodelics of honey needed = 14 - (7/60) x 100 = 9 skodelics of honey Therefore, Mary needs to add 9 more skodelics of honey to her recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of sugar and 10 cups of honey to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required for the recipe. So, if the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and she has already used 12 - 11 = 1 cup of sugar, then she still needs 1 cup of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 skodlces of honey to her recipe and it is required for 10 skodlces of sugar. So we need to find out how many skodlces of honey she needs to add more.  To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar (30 skodlces) by the number of skodlces of honey she has already added (6). This will give us the remaining amount of honey needed: 30 / 6 = 5 skodlces. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 5 skodlces of honey to her recipe.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of sugar and 14 cups of honey. If we have already given 4 cups of honey, then we need to give more honey than sugar. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of cups of honey needed = Total amount of honey required - Amount of honey already given
= 14 cups - 4 cups
= 10 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to give 10 additional cups of honey to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 7 skodelic (or cups) of sugar and 4 skodelic (or cups) of salt. Since Mary has already given 2 skodelics (or cups) of honey, she now needs to provide 5 more skodelics (or cups) of honey than the amount of salt required. Therefore, Mary needs to give 5 + 4 = 9 skodelics (or cups) of honey.
Response:  We know that Mary has given 12 skodelics of honey (moke). The recipe requires 6 skodelics of honey more than the amount of salt required. So, we need to find out how much salt is needed. Salt requirement = Total amount of salt needed / Amount of honey already given = 9 skodelics / 12 skodelics = 3/4 skodlits of salt. Since there are 8 skodelics in one cup, 3/4 cup of salt is needed. Therefore, Mary needs 3/4 cup of salt more than she has already given.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 4 skodelices of sugar (which is equal to 4/10 of the total amount needed). So we need to find out how much more sugar she needs to give. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of sugar needed by the number of skodelices she has already given:  Total amount of sugar needed = 7 skodelices x 10 skodelices per cup = 70 skodelices Sugar already given by Mary = 4 skodelices Therefore, the amount of sugar left to be given by Mary = Remaining amount - Amount already given = 70 - 4 = 66 skodelices.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of milk.  Mary has given 10 cups of sugar already. To find out how many more cups of milk she needs to give, we can subtract the number of cups she has given from the total amount required: 14 - 10 = 4 cups of milk needed. So, Mary needs 4 more cups of milk than the amount of sugar she has given.
Response:  We know that 19 bird families live near the mountain and 60 of them have migrated for winter. So, if we subtract 60 from 19, we get 13 remaining bird families that did not migrate. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  We know that 87 bird families live near the mountain and 7 of them have migrated for winter. So, if we subtract 7 from 87, we get 80 remaining bird families.
"Response:  We know that 20 bird families migrated away for winter and 14 stayed behind. So, if we assume that each bird family consists of an average number of birds (e.g., 5), then...

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ bird\ families\ staying\ near\ the\ mountain = 14 $$

Now, let's find out how many birds are left near the mountain. Since $20$ bird families migrated away, and each family has $5$ birds on average, the total number of birds that migrated away is:

$$ \therefore Total\ number\ of\ birds\ migration = 20 \times 5 = 100 $$

So, the number of birds remaining near the mountain is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ birds\ remaining\ near\ the\ mountain = 14 - 100 = -86 $$

Therefore, there were $86$ fewer birds near the mountain at the beginning of the passage than there were initially."
Response:  We know that 85 bird families live near the mountain and 23 of them have migrated to Africa. So, the number of bird families left near the mountain is: 85 - 23 = 62. Now we are told that 37 bird families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, the total number of bird families that remain near the mountain is: 62 + 37 = 99.
Response:  We know that there are eight bird families near the mountain and that 42 of them have migrated to Africa. So, we can say that 42/8 = 5 birds from each family have migrated to Africa. Now, let's find out how many bird families have migrated to Asia. According to the question, 31 bird families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, we can say that 31/8 = 4 bird families have migrated to Asia. Finally, we want to know which destination has more migratory bird families than the other. To do this, we need to compare the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa (5) with the number of bird families that have migrated to Asia (4). Since 5 > 4, we can conclude that more bird families have migrated to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that 38 bird families live near the mountain and 94 bird families have migrated to Asia or Africa. So, we can write an equation: Number of birds that went to Asia = Number of birds that went to Africa + 38 (bird families living near the mountain) Now let's solve for the number of birds that went to Asia: Number of birds that went to Asia = 94 - 47 = 47 Therefore, there are 47 more birds that went to Asia than to Africa.
Response:  We know that 18 bird families live near the mountain and 38 bird families have migrated to Africa. So, the total number of bird families that did not migrate is 18 + 80 = 98. Therefore, 98 - 38 = 60 bird families migrated to Africa for winter.
Response:  We know that most birds migrate to warmer areas during winter and return to their original habitats when spring arrives. Therefore, we can assume that there are only a few bird families living near the mountain during winter. If 87 bird families lived nearby before winter, then after winter, if 18 new bird families have joined them, the total number of bird families living nearby will be greater than 87. So, the correct answer is more than 87.
Response:  We know that 49 bird families live near the mountain and 59 bird families have migrated for winter. This means that there are 108 bird families (49 + 59) living nearby the mountain. Now, we learn that 24 new bird families came from an Arctic region to settle near the mountain. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now 108 + 24 = 132. Therefore, 132 bird families remain near the mountain after the migration.
Response:  We know that 27 bird families have migrated from near the mountain and only 41 bird families are left near the mountain. So, we can say that there were initially 68 bird families (27 + 41) living near the mountain. Now, let's find out how many of them remained after migration. To do this, we need to divide the number of bird families remaining (41) by the total initial number of bird families (68). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of bird families remaining = 41 / 68 = 0.62 or approximately 62%.
Response:  We know that almost all animals migrate to warmer climates during winter and we also know that out of 86 bird families, 45 have left their homes near the mountain for winter. So, if there were 86 bird families nearby the mountain before migration, then after migration, there will be 41 fewer families (since 45 birds have left). Therefore, the number of bird families remaining nearby the mountain is 41.
Response:  We know that 41 bird families live near the mountain and 35 of them have migrated to Asia. So, there are 41 - 35 = 7 bird families left near the mountain. Now we need to find out how many of these 7 families have migrated to Africa. According to the question, 62 bird families have migrated to Africa. Therefore, the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa is equal to 7 - 62 = -55.
Response:  We know that 3 families of birds live near the mountain and 26 new bird families have come from the Arctic to live there. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is 3 + 26 = 29. Therefore, the number of bird families that remained near the mountain after some families migrated south for winter is 29 - 2 = 27.
Response:  If Paul received 253 colored pencils for his birthday and he lost or gave away 70 of them during the school year, then he had 183 pencils left at the end of the school year (253 - 70 = 183).
Response:  If he got 600 swatches for his birthday and lost or gave away 551 of them, then he has 600 - 551 = 49 swatches left. So, he received 49 swatches for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul had 440 colored pencils to start with and gave away 111 of them during his school year. This means he has fewer pencils now than when he started. So if he has X number of pencils left, then he must have given away X + 111 pencils. Now we are told that Paul lost 106 pencils, which means he has X - 106 pencils left. Therefore, the final answer is X = 274 pencils.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 65 colored pencils for his birthday and gave away 213 to his friend during the school year. So far, we have:

Paul has 65 - 213 = -148 pencils less than he had at the beginning of the school year.

Now, we are told that Paul lost 16 pencils. Therefore, the final number of pencils Paul has is:

-148 + 16 = -132 pencils

So, there were 132 pencils that Paul either lost or gave away during the school year."
Response:  We know that Paul gave his friend 571 swingers for their birthday and lost 161. So he has 410 swingers left. Now we are told that Paul received 589 colored pencils as a gift for his birthday. Therefore, the difference between the number of pencils Paul received and the number he had is equal to the number of pencils he gave away plus the number he lost.  So, the answer is: 589 - (410 + 161) = 268.
Response:  If Paul had received 110 colored pencils for his birthday and gave away 90 of them to a friend during the school year, then he has 20 (110 - 90) left. However, he lost 412 pencils in total, which means that he lost more than he gave away. So, the difference between the number of pencils he lost and the number he gave away is 412 - 90 = 322 pencils. Therefore, Paul lost 322 pencils more than he gave away.
Response:  If Paul gave his friend 563 swingers for their birthday and he himself lost 558, then he had 332 left. So, he got 332 swings for his birthday.
Response:  If Paul had 492 paintbrushes and gave away 52 of them to his friend, then he has 492 - 52 = 440 paintbrushes left. Now, if he lost 535 paintbrushes, then he has 440 - 535 = -195 paintbrushes. So, the correct answer is -195.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 colored pencils and 66 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had only 154 left. So, we can calculate how many were lost or given away as follows: Number of remaining pencils = 154 Number of pencils at start = 521 - Number of pencils at end = 154 Loss = Number of pencils at end - Number of remaining pencils = 521 - 154 = 367 Therefore, 367 colored pencils were either lost or given away during the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 531 colored pencils and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had only 391 erasers left without losing any. So, we can conclude that Paul had more than three times as many pencils as erasers (531 / 39 = > 13). Therefore, Paul had more than 1000 colored pencils (531 - 39 = 492).
Response:  We know that Paul received 601 barware paintbrushes and 406 gumballs for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had only 336 pieces left, without losing any gumballs. So we can conclude that Paul had more than twice as many gumballs as paintbrushes. Therefore, the answer is 2 x 406 = 812.
"Response:  If Paul received 40 colored pencils for his birthday and he had 315 of them before losing or giving away some, then we can calculate how many he has left as follows:

Number of pencils Paul has left = Number of pencils he received for his birthday - Total number of pencils he had before (including those he lost/gave away)
= 40 - 315
= -275
So, Paul has 275 colored pencils left."
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 colored pencils for his birthday and lost 231 of them during the school year. This means he has 36 (267 - 231) pencils left. Now, we are told that he gave away 308 pencils to his friends. So, the number of pencils he has left is equal to the number he gave away minus the number he lost: 36 - 308 = -272. Therefore, Paul gave away more pencils than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul received $457 worth of gum and had $320 worth of coins at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school year, he had only $523 left, which means he didn't lose any gum or coins. So, we can conclude that Paul had more coins than gum. In particular, he had $320 - $457 = $93 worth of coins more than gum. Therefore, the answer is $93.
Response:  At first, there were 11 parties and some of them left, leaving 3 parties behind. So, initially, there were 11 - 3 = 8 parties. Now, we are told that some more parties have joined, but we don't know how many. Therefore, the final number of parties is 8 + x, where x is the number of new parties that joined. Since the total number of parties cannot be negative, x must be non-negative.
Response: 3 - 2 = 1 So, there are now 4 parties left as opposed to the 3 that had gone away.
Response:  When he had 9 friends, he had 12 - 9 = 3 more friends than at first. So initially, he had 3 + 9 = 12 friends.
Response:  We know that there were initially 14 stanks and 7 stanks have been used so far (7 = 14 - 7). So, if we subtract 7 from 14, we get 7. Therefore, there are 7 stanks left.
Response:  At first, he had 13 stanks and some of them left, so he had fewer stanks. Then, he got 4 new stanks, which means he has more stanks now than before they left. So, if he had 9 stanks after that, it means he lost 4 stanks when the original 13 stanks were reduced by some leaving, and then gained 4 new stanks. Therefore, there are 9 - 4 = 5 stanks remaining.
Response:  We know that he had 12 stanks initially and then 15 stanks left. So, his total number of stanks is 12 + 15 = 27. Now, he got 14 new stanks, so his updated total number of stanks is 27 + 14 = 41. Therefore, he has 41 stanks in total.
Response:  At first, there were three parties (A, B, and C). Then, some more parties came into existence (D, E, F, G, H, I, J), making it eight total parties. So, new parties that came into existence are: D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, he had 8 stanks and some of them left, leaving him with 5 stanks. Then, he got 99 new stanks. So, in total, he has 99 + 5 = 104 stanks.
Response:  At first, he had 12 stanks and some of them left, leaving him with 14 stanks. Then, he got 10 new stanks, bringing his total to 24 stanks (14 + 10). So, he has 24 stanks now.
Response:  At first, Dan had $3. Then he bought chocolate for $2, so now he has $1 left. Therefore, at the beginning, Dan had $3.
Response:  We know that Dan had $4 and spent $3 on chocolate. So he has $1 left. Now we need to find out how much the chocolate cost him. If he spent $3 on it and he had $4 in total, then the chocolate must have cost $4-$3= $1. Therefore, the chocolate cost $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 99 chocolate bars for $3 each. So, in total, he spent $3 x 99 = $297. Now we need to find out how much money is left with him. To do this, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount of money he had: $4 - $297 = $-293. Therefore, there are $-293 dollars remaining with Dan.
"Response:  If he bought 3 chocolates for $7, and each chocolate cost $4, then...

$7 / 3 = $2 per chocolate
So, each chocolate costs $2."
Response:  If he has $2 and bought some chocolate bars for $6, then he spent $6 - $2 = $4 on those chocolate bars. Since each bar costs $3, he bought $\frac{4}{3}$ = 1 chocolate bar. So, he bought one chocolate bar.
Response:  We know that Dan has $7 and he spent $2 for chocolate bar and $3 for another one. So, we subtract these amounts from his initial amount of money: $7 - $2 = $5 and $7 - $3 = $4. Therefore, Dan still has $5 + $4 = $9 dollars left.
Response:  If Dan has $4 and buys a chocolate bar for $7, he will be left with $4 - $7 = -$3.  If he then buys some chocolate for $6, he will have spent another $6 + (-$3) = $3. So, in total, Dan has spent $3 + ($-3) = $0. Therefore, he has not spent any money on chocolate.
Response:  If he paid $2 for two dollars and $3 for chocolate, then he spent a total of $5 = $2 + $3. So, he spent $5 to buy the chocolate bar.
Response:  For $2, he bought chocolate. So, he spent $2 for chocolate.  For $3, he bought another chocolate bar. So, he spent $3 + $2 = $5 for both chocolate bars and the stick. Therefore, he spent $5 / 2 = $2.50 for the stick.
Response:  We know that Dan had $4 initially and then spent $8 for chocolate bar. So he has $4 - $8 = -$4 left. Then his friend gave him $5, so now he has $5 + (-$4) = $1. Therefore, there is $1 remaining.
Response:  If he had $4 at the beginning and spent $2 on chocolate, then he has $4 - $2 = $2 left. So, the cost of the chocolate is $2.
Response:  We know that Dan has spent $3 for 10 chocolate bars, so he has $3 / 10 = $0.30 left. Therefore, Dan has $4 - $0.30 = $3.70 left.
Response:  If he paid $4 for 2 chocolates that cost the same, then each chocolate costs half of the total amount spent. So, if he spent $4, then each chocolate costs $4 / 2 = $2.
Response:  If he spent 3 dollars for one chocolate bar and 7 dollars for another chocolate bar, then he spent a total of 3 + 7 = 10 dollars. So, he spent 10 dollars for both chocolate bars.
Response:  If he spent $4 for one chocolate bar and $7 for another, then he spent a total of $11 for both bars.  If he also spent $2 for a stick of chocolate, then he spent a total of $13. Therefore, he spent $13 / $11 = $1.20 per unit (chocolate bar or stick) for each item.
Response:  If Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them at his garage sale, then he has 37 books left (115 - 78 = 37). So, Paul still has 37 books in his possession.
Response:  At first, Paul had some books (we don't know how many). Then he sold 137 of them and had 105 left. So initially, Paul had 137 + 105 = 242 books.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after giving some to his friend he was left with 62 books. Now we are asked how many books he sold at the garage sale. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of books he gave away (35) from the total number of books he had left (62). So, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is: 62 - 35 = 27 books.
Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and after buying some from the garage sale he had 151 books left. So, we can calculate how many books he bought as follows: Number of books bought = Total number of books - Initial number of books = 151 - 50 = 101 books. Therefore, Paul bought 101 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had two books initially. If he sold each book for $20, then he made $40 in total from selling those two books. Now, if he bought 150 new books and sold them all at $20 each, then he made an additional $3000 ($150 x 20). So, his total earnings are $3040 ($40 + $3000). Therefore, he has 58 books left with him.
Response:  If Paul had 21 books initially and sold them for $42, then he has $42 - 21 = $21 left after selling his initial stock of books. Now, if he bought 42 new books, that means he now has $21 + 42 = $63 worth of books in total. So, the difference between the number of books he sold (42) and the number of books he purchased (42) is zero, which means he did not buy any additional books beyond what he sold. Therefore, the correct answer is $0.
Response:  If Paul had initially 71 books and sold 38 of them, then he has 71 - 38 = 33 remaining books. Now, if he bought 38 new books, then he has 33 + 38 = 71 books again. So, he bought more books than he sold.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pencils. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pencils left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of books = 108 - x Where 'x' represents the number of books sold at the garage sale. Similarly, for pencils, we have: Number of pencils = 55 - y Where 'y' represents the number of pencils sold at the garage sale. Now, we are asked how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To find out, we can substitute the value of 'x' from the first equation into the second equation: Number of books sold = 66 - (108 - x) = 66 - 47 = 19 Therefore, Paul sold 19 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 51 books and 106 pencils. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pencils left. So, if he sold x pencils at the garage sale, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of pencils = Initial number of pencils - Number of pencils after sale. In this case, the initial number of pencils is 106, and the number of pencils after the sale is 14. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: Number of pencils = 106 - 14. Solving for x, we find that Paul sold 92 pencils at the garage sale. Therefore, the answer to the question is 92.
Response:  If Paul had 136 books and sold some of them at the garage sale, then he must have started with fewer than 136 books (since selling some means you start with more). So let's assume he started with x books. Then we know that after selling some books, he was left with 27 books. Therefore, the difference between the number of books he started with (x) and the number he ended up with (27) is equal to the number of books he sold (109): x - 27 = 109. Solving for x, we get: x = 89. So Paul sold 89 books at the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul had initially had 134 books and gave away 39 to his friend, then he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, if he sold 68 of these books at the garage sale, that means he is now left with 27 books (95 - 68 = 27). So, he sold 68 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 swine and 153 books. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 swine left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left after sale = 153 - 13 = 140 books Now, let's find out how many swine were sold during the garage sale. We are given that Paul had 95 swine initially, and after selling some of them, he had 23 swine left. Therefore, we can write another equation: Number of swine sold = Total number of swine - Number of swine left after sale = 95 - 23 = 72 swine So, altogether, Paul sold 140 books and 72 swine during the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Pavel had initially 42 swings and 143 books. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 swings left. So, if he sold x swings at the garage sale, then he would have 113 - x books left. Now we can use the information given in the problem to find out how many swings Pavel sold at the garage sale. We know that for every book he sold, he got $5, and for every swing he sold, he got $2. Therefore, the total amount of money Pavel earned from selling his books is: Books: 113 x $5 = $565 Swings: 19 x $2 = $38 Total amount of money earned = $565 + $38 = $603 So, Pavel sold 603 swings at the garage sale.
Response:  If there were initially 10 vrtnic and Jessica took out 8 of them, then there are left 2 vrtnice in the vase. So, the final number of vrtnic in the vase is 2.
Response:  We know that Jessica has taken out 16 vortices from her own well and put them into a vase. So there are 23 vortices in the vase now. To find out how many vortices were initially in the vase, we need to subtract the number of vortices Jessica took out (16) from the total number of vortices in the vase (23). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that Jessica threw four vases out of the window and cut new vases from her own garden to put into the window. So, there are 23 vases in total. Now, we need to find out how many vases Jessica cut from her own garden. Since she threw 4 vases away, she must have had 23 - 4 = 19 vases left in her garden before cutting any new ones. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 vases from her own garden.
Response:  Jessica threw away 33 vases and added some new ones from her flower garden to make up for it. So there are now 17 vases in total. To find out how many vases she cut, we need to subtract the number of vases she threw away (33) from the total number of vases (17). Therefore, Jessica cut 16 vases.
Response:  We know that Jessica threw away 34 vases and added some new ones from her flower garden to make up for it. So, there are now 15 vases in total. If we assume that each vase contains an equal number of flowers (which is not necessarily true), then we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total number of vases x Number of flowers per vase  In this case, the total number of vases is 15, so if we divide it by the number of flowers per vase (let's say 5, just for simplicity), we get: Number of flowers = 15 x 5 = 75 flowers Therefore, Jessica threw away 34 - 75 = -49 vases.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 vortices in the jar and Jessica took out some more to make it 59. So, if she took out x vortices from the jar, then the number of vortices left in the jar is 20 - x. Therefore, we can conclude that Jessica took out 13 vortices (20 - x) from the jar.
Response:  We know that Jessica took out some flowers from the garden and put them in her basket. She had 13 flowers in total. Then she went to the park and found 21 more flowers there. So, if we subtract the number of flowers she already had (13) from the total number of flowers she found (21), we get 8. Therefore, there are 8 flowers left in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 vortices and 62 orchids in the tank. Then Jessica took some more vortices and orchids from her garden. In the tank, there are now 17 vortices and 96 orchids. So we can calculate how many vortices Jessica took as follows: Number of vortices taken = Total number of vortices in the tank - Initial number of vortices in the tank = 17 - 15 = 2. Therefore, Jessica took 2 vortices from the tank.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 vortices and 2 orchids in the tank. Then Jessica took some more vortices from her own vortex and put them back into the tank. So, after this operation, there are now 10 vortices left in the tank. Now let's count how many orchids are left in the tank. There were originally 2 orchids, so they didn't change. Therefore, we have 10 vortices and 2 orchids left in the tank. To find out how many orchids Jessica removed, we need to subtract the number of orchids she had at first (2) from the total number of orchids left in the tank (4). So, Jessica removed 2 orchids.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 vortices and 3 orchids in the tank.  Jessica took some more vortices from her own tank, so let's say she took x vortices.  Now, we have 12 vortices left in the tank (including the initial 5).  And we also know that there are still 2 orchids in the tank. So, if we subtract the number of orchids (2) from the total number of vortices (12), we get the number of vortices that Jessica took from the tank:  $x = 12 - 2 = 10$. Therefore, Jessica took 10 vortices from the tank.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 vortices and 12 orchids in the tank. Then Jessica took some more vortices from her own tank. So now there are 11 vortices and 20 orchids in the tank. To find out how many orchids are in the tank more than the number of vortices, we need to subtract the number of vortices from the total number of orchids. Therefore, the answer is 20 - 11 = 9.
Response:  If there were initially 3 vrtnice in the vase and Jessica took out some of them, then we can say that she removed x number of vrtnic. Since there are now 19 vrtnic left in the vase, we know that x = 16 (since 19 - 3 = 16). So, Jessica removed 16 vrtnic from the vase.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 vortices and 84 orchids in the tank. Then Jessica took some more vortices and orchids from her own garden. In the tank, there are now 91 orchids and 14 vortices left. To find out how many vortices Jessica removed, we need to subtract the number of vortices she had from the total number of vortices in the tank before she started removing them. So, the answer is 14 - 13 = 1. Therefore, Jessica removed 1 vorton.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 vases and 3 orchids. If Jessica took some from her own vase, then we can assume she took at most half of them (since she only has 3). So, let's say she took 8 vases from her own vase. Now, we have 24 vases left (16 original + 8 taken from Jessica) and 3 orchids. Then, Jessica takes some more vases from the common vase, which means she took at most half of what was left (again, since she only has 3). So, let's say she took 12 vases from the common vase. Now, we have 12 vases left (24 - 12 = 12), and 3 orchids are still there. Therefore, Jessica took 9 vases from both vases combined (8 from her own + 12 from the common).
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 vortices and 20 orchids in the tank.  Jessica took some more vortices from her own pond, so now there are fewer vortices than before.  But we also know that there are still more orchids than vortices in the tank! So, if there are x vortices left in the tank after Jessica took some away, then there must be x + 20 orchids left too (since she only took vortices from her own pond). Therefore, the number of vortices left in the tank is equal to 6 - x, and the number of orchids left is equal to x + 20. Now we can solve for x using substitution or elimination. For example, we could use substitution by solving for x = 6 - y, where y is the number of vortices taken by Jessica. Then we would have 6 - y = x + 20, which simplifies to 2y = 20. Solving for y gives us y = 10, so x = 6 - 10 = 4. Thus, there are 4 vortices left in the tank after Jessica took some away, and there are 24 orchids left (x + 20).
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 flowers and 6 orchids in the vase.  Jessica took some of them from her garden and put them back into the vase. So, after she did this, there were 13 orchids and 3 violets left in the vase. Now we need to find out how many more orchids are in the vase than in Jessica's garden. To do this, we can subtract the number of orchids Jessica took from her garden (6) from the total number of orchids in the vase (13): 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 more orchids in the vase than in Jessica's garden.
Response:  If her hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some centimeters, let's say 5 cm (which is equal to 2 inches). So now her hair is 17 - 5 = 12 inches long. Then she trimmed it again by 3 inches, which means her new length is 12 - 3 = 9 inches. Therefore, if her hair was originally 17 inches long and she trimmed it twice, then her hair is currently 9 inches long.
Response:  Before she cut her hair, Robin had X number of centimeters of hair. After cutting it off, she has Y number of centimeters of hair, where Y = 30 - 20 = 10 centimeters. So, X = Y / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 centimeters. Therefore, before she cut her hair, Robin had 5 centimeters of hair.
Response:  The original length of Robin's hair was 16 centimeters (cm). Then, she cut it to 15 cm. After that, she grew it back by 12 inches (in), which is equal to 0.3 meters (m). So, the final length of her hair is: 16 + (-1) = 15 cm + 0.3 m = 15.3 cm.
Response:  If Robinovih lasjev was already 30 cm long and it grew another 18 cm, then their total length is now 48 cm (30 + 18). So, Robinova frizura is currently 48 cm long.
"Response:  If Robin had initially cut off 13 centimeters from her hair and it was previously 45 centimeters long, then we can calculate how much hair she has left as follows:

Hair length before cutting = 45 cm
Length of hair cut off = 13 cm
New length of hair = Hair length before cutting - Length of hair cut off
= 45 cm - 13 cm
= 32 cm

So, Robin now has 32 centimeters of hair left."
Response:  The length of Robinovih lasjev was initially 45 cm, and then she cut off 8 cm (or 2 palces). So, the new length of her hair is: 45 - 8 = 37 cm. Then, she cut off another 20 cm (or 6 palces), leaving her with: 37 - 20 = 17 cm. Therefore, Robinova frizura is currently 17 cm long.
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 cups in his collection and he found 53 cups in the park. So, if we subtract the number of cups he already had from the total number of cups found, we get:  Number of cups Danny now has = Total number of cups found - Number of cups he already had  Number of cups he already had = 12 (from the question) Total number of cups found = 53 (from the question) Therefore, the number of cups Danny now has is: Number of cups Danny now has = 53 - 12 = 41 cups.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 21 glasses in his collection and he found some more glasses in the park. So, we can say that the total number of glasses Danny found is equal to the difference between the total number of glasses he collected and the number of glasses he already had in his collection. Therefore, the number of glasses Danny found in the park is:  Total number of glasses - Number of glasses in collection = 53 - 21 = 32. So, Danny found 32 glasses in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 63 covers for glasses in the park and rejected 51 old ones. So he gained 12 new covers (63 - 51 = 12). Now we are asked how many covers did Danny have at the beginning. Since he gained 12 new covers, he must have had fewer than 12 initially. Therefore, Danny had 0 covers at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 36 covers for glasses in the park and threw away 35 of them. So he has 22 covers left in his collection. To find out how many more covers Danny found than he threw away, we can subtract the number of covers he threw away from the total number of covers he found: 22 - 35 = 13. Therefore, Danny found 13 more covers in the park than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 caps for bottles in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he gained 30 - 63 = -33 caps. Now we have 42 caps left in his collection. Therefore, Danny threw away more caps than he found in the park, which is equal to -33.
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 pokrovca and 8 omeva in the park initially. So he had x = 22 + 8 = 30 pokrovcov at first. Then, he collected additional 28 pokrovcov and 63 omeva. Therefore, his final number of pokrovcov is x + 28 = 30 + 28 = 58. Similarly, his final number of omeva is x + 63 = 30 + 63 = 93. So, Danny had 58 pokrovcov and 93 omeva initially.
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 covers and 30 capsules in the park. So he had 22 + 30 = 52 objects at first. Then, he collected 17 more covers and 57 more capsules. Therefore, his final number of objects is 52 + 17 = 69. So, Danny had 69 pieces of paper at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 caps for bottles and 14 labels in the park. So he had 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection before he went to the park. Now we are told that after going to the park, he has 7 caps for bottles and 86 labels. Therefore, the number of caps for bottles that Danny found in the park is 7 - 30 = -23. Since negative numbers cannot be used as answers, we can conclude that Danny did not find any caps for bottles in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 caps and 28 ties in the park. So he had 11 + 28 = 39 items in his collection before he went to the park. Now we are told that after going to the park, he has 68 caps and 51 ties in his collection. Therefore, the number of ties Danny found in the park is 51 - 28 = 23 more than the number of caps he found. So Danny found 23 more ties than caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny initially found 71 pokrovčkov and 24 omeva in the park. This means he had 95 items (71 pokrovčkov + 24 omeva) in his collection before he added any more. Then, he found additional 28 pokrovčkov and 16 omeva in the park. So, now he has 103 items (95 initial + 28 new pokrovčkov + 16 new omeva) in his collection. Therefore, Danny currently has 28 more pokrovčkov than he initially did.
Response:  We know that Danny had 10 covers for glasses and 62 empties in the park. So he collected 27 more covers and 43 more empties. Therefore, Danny has now 27 + 43 = 70 more empties than covers. In other words, he has 62 - 70 = -8 fewer empties than covers.  So, Danny has -8 more empties than covers.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 pokrovcov for glasses in the park and now he has 25 left in his collection. So, to find out how many he had at first, we need to subtract the number of lost pokrovcov from the total number of pokrovcov he had:  Number of pokrovcov Danny had at first = Total number of pokrovcov - Number of lost pokrovcov  In this case, the total number of pokrovcov Danny had was 100 (since he started with 100 pokrovcov), and he lost 66 pokrovcov, so:  Number of pokrovcov Danny had at first = 100 - 66 = 34  Therefore, Danny had 34 pokrovcov for glasses at the beginning.
Response:  If Danny had 25 pokrovec in his collection and he found some more in the park, then he has now 32 pokrovcev in total. So, the difference between the number of pokrovcev he had before (25) and the number he has now (32) is equal to the number of pokrovcev he found in the park (7). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that Danny found 58 new covers in the park and already had 60 old ones at the beginning. So, he has a total of 60 + 58 = 118 covers now. Therefore, Danny had 118 - 60 = 58 covers at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away six old covers for glasses in the park and found 50 new ones. So, he has 60 covers in total now. To find out how many more covers he found than he threw away, we can subtract the number of throws away from the total number of finds: 60 - 6 = 54. Therefore, Danny found 54 more covers than he threw away in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 54 old covers and found 48 new ones in the park. So he gained 6 (54 - 48) new covers. Now we have 52 covers in total, including both old and new ones. Therefore, Danny threw away more covers than he found in the park, which is equal to 6 - 4 = 2 more covers.
Response:  We know that Danny found 82 paper sheets and 29 caps of glass bottles in the park. He now has 42 caps for glass bottles and 61 labels. So he had 30 fewer caps at the beginning (82 - 30 = 52). Therefore, Danny had 52 caps at the start.
Response:  We know that Danny found 66 paper wrappers and 39 caps of glass bottles in the park. Now he has 16 caps for glass bottles and 68 paper wrappers in his collection. So initially, Danny had 66 + 39 = 105 pieces of paper.
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 paper wrappers and caps for bottles in the park. Then he collected 21 caps and 52 wrappers from his collection. So, we can calculate how many more caps he found in the park as follows: Number of additional caps = Total number of caps found in the park - Number of caps already in his collection = 52 - 21 = 31 Therefore, Danny found 31 more caps in the park than he had in his collection initially.
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 paperweights and 5 covers for glasses in the park. Now he has 31 covers and 9 paperweights in his collection. To find out how many more paperweights than covers Danny found in the park, we can subtract the number of covers from the total number of objects he found: 65 - 31 = 34 So, Danny found 34 more paperweights than covers in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 58 pokrovcev and 25 omevs in the park initially. Then he found 11 more omevs and 12 more pokrovcev for glasses. So, we can calculate the total number of pokrovcev as follows: Total no. of pokrovcev = Initial no. of pokrovcev + Number of new pokrovcev found = 58 + 11 = 69 Pokrovcev Now, let's find out how many omevs Danny has now: Total no. of omevs = Initial no. of omevs + Number of new omevs found = 25 + 12 = 37 Omevs Therefore, Danny currently has 69 pokrovcev and 37 omevs in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny had 18 ometov and 15 pokrovcev in the park. So he gained 67 - 18 = 49 ometov and lost 15 - 18 = -3 pokrovcev. Therefore, Danny now has 49 + 3 = 52 ometov and 35 - 3 = 32 pokrovcev for his collection. So, Danny has more ometov than pokrovcev now.
Response:  If Jake has 11 more biscuits than Steven, and Jake has 17 biscuits in total, then we can say that Steven has x biscuits in total. Since Jake has 11 more biscuits than Steven, we can subtract 11 from the number of biscuits that Steven has to find out how many biscuits Jake has. So, if Steven has x biscuits, then Jake has x - 11 biscuits. Therefore, the answer is (x - 11).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 breasts and more than 14 breasts than Jill. So, we can assume that Jake has x breasts where x is between 14 and 7 = 7. Now, we are told that Steven has 15 breasts, which means that Jake must have less than 15 breasts. Therefore, Jake has exactly 12 breasts (x - 15).
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 years old and Steve has 13 more than Jake. So, Steve is 21 years old (18 + 13 = 21). Now we are told that Steve has 19 years old. This means that Jill has less than 19 years old. Therefore, Jill has 18 years old.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 3 breaks than Steve. So, let's assume that Jake has x breaks. Since Steve has 8 breaks and Jill has 5 breaks, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 8 = 3 + 5  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, Jake has 10 more breaks than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has 11 more biscuits than Jake and he also has four more biscuits than Jake. So we can write an equation as follows:  Jake - 4 = Steven + 11  Now let's solve for Jill's number of biscuits.  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:  Jake - 4 = Steven + 11  Subtracting Jake's number of biscuits (which is 12) from both sides gives us:  -4 = Steven + 11  Finally, subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:  -8 = Steven + 11  Therefore, Jill has 8 more biscuits than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 7 books and less than 9 books. So, there must be 8 books in total. And since Steven has 16 books, Jake has 8 - 16 = 8 books.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 books more than Steven and 8 books less than Jill. So, if Steven has 17 books, then Jake has 17 + 7 = 24 books. Therefore, Jill has 24 - 8 = 16 books.
Response:  We know that Jake has 9 books more than Steven and 18 years old than Jill. So we can write an equation as follows:  Books = 9 + (Age - 18)  Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:  Books = 9 + (-18)  Books = 9 + 18  Books = 27 Therefore, Steven has 27 more books than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 18 breasts. So if Jake has 6 less breasts than Steven, then he must have 12 breasts. Therefore, Jake has 12 breasts.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 18 balls and less than 36 balls (since he has 24 balls). So, we can say that Steven has between 19 and 24 balls. Now, let's consider Jill. She has fewer balls than Steven but more than Jake. Therefore, she must have between 19 and 24 balls as well. Finally, since Jake has fewer balls than both Steven and Jill, he must have between 0 and 18 balls. Thus, Jake has at most 18 balls.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 15 balls than Jake. So, if Jake has x balls, then Steven has x + 15 balls. Now we know that Jill has 12 balls less than Steven, so Jill has (x + 15) - 12 = 3 balls fewer than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 3 balls fewer than Steven.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 breskev and 14 jabolk. So, we can write an equation as follows: Breskev = Total number of breskev - Number of jabolk. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Breskev = 12 - 14 = -2. Therefore, Jake has -2 breskev.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 13 apples and less than 20 apples. So, we can say that Jake has between 14-19 apples. Now, let's check the information given in the question: -Jake has 13 more bananas than Steven. This means that if Steven has x bananas, then Jake has x + 13 bananas. -Jake has 3 fewer oranges than Steven. This means that if Steven has x oranges, then Jake has x - 3 oranges. From the first statement, we know that Jake has between 14-19 bananas. Using this range, we can calculate the number of oranges Jake has as follows: x = (14-19) × 3 = 46-77 oranges Therefore, Jake has 46-77 oranges. Since Jake has 9 bananas and 8 jables, he must have 46-77 oranges. So, Jake has exactly 59 oranges.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has y apples, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 8 + 6 (since Jake has 6 more apples)
y = 17 - 6 (since Steven has 6 fewer apples)
Now, we need to solve for y, which is the number of apples that Steven has. To do this, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the first equation:
x = 8 + 6
Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:
x = 2
So, Jake has 2 more apples than Steven. Now, let's find out how many apples Steven has by using the second equation:
y = 17 - 6
Solving for y, we get:
y = 11
Therefore, Steven has 11 apples. Finally, to determine how many more or fewer apples Steven has than Jake, we can use the following calculation:
Difference between Steven's apples and Jake's apples = |Steven's apples - Jake's apples|
Using our previous calculations, we have:
Difference = |11 - 2|
= |9|
= 9
So, Steven has 9 more apples than Jake."
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 more apples than brakes. So if Jake has x apples and brakes, then Steven has x - 3 apples and brakes. Now we can see that Steven has 12 brakes and 15 jokes, so he has 12 + 15 = 27 brakes. Since Steven has more brakes than apples, he must have at least as many apples as brakes. Therefore, Steven has 27 apples.  But we also know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 27 + 10 = 37 apples. Finally, since Jake has more apples than brakes, he must have at least as many brakes as apples. Therefore, Jake has 37 brakes.  So to summarize, Steven has 27 apples and 27 brakes, while Jake has 37 apples and 37 brakes.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 12 breasts and more than 4 breasts. So, we can say that Jake has x breasts where x is between 4 and 12 (inclusive). Now, we are told that Jill has 67 breasts more than Jake. Therefore, if Jake has x breasts, then Jill has x + 67 breasts. So, the number of breasts Jake has is 4 < x < 12. Since there are 100 breasts in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 67) = 100. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 67 = 100. Solving for x, we get: x = 35. So, Jake has 35 breasts.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 books more than Steven. So, if Steven has x books, then Jake has x + 12 books. Since Jill has fewer books than Jake, we can say that Jill has x - 8 books. Therefore, Jill has 8 books less than Steven. So, the number of books Jill has is x - 8 = 6.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 12 but less than 19 breskev. So, we can say that Jake has x breskev where x is between 12 and 19 (inclusive). Now, we are also given that Jake has 72 more than Jill. This means that Jake has a total of x + 72 breskev. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 72 = 104 (since Jake has more than Jill by 72 breskev) Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method to find out how many breskev Jake has. Solution: Substituting the value of x from the equation into the original question, we get: Steven has 19 - 12 = 7 breskev Jake has 7 + 72 = 89 breskev Therefore, Jake has 89 breskev.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer balls than Steven and more balls than Jill. So we can write an inequality based on this information:  Jake has at most 6 - 3 = 3 more balls than Jill. Therefore, if Jill has x balls, Jake has at most x + 3 balls. Now let's find out how many balls Jill has:  Since Jake has 6 balls, and he is 3 more than Jill, Jill must have 6 - 3 = 3 balls.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 jabolki and 10 less than Steven has. So, if Steven has 13 breskev, then Jake must have 13 + 10 = 23 breskev.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 13 jabolk and less than 17 breskev. So, we can say that Jake has x jabolk. Since Steven has 8 breskev, we know that Jake does not have fewer than 8 breskev. Therefore, we can write an inequality:  x > 8. Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we will use the information given in the problem: Jake has more than 13 jabolk and less than 17 breskev. This means that x is between 13 and 17 inclusive. Therefore, the solution is x = 15. So, Jake has 15 jabolk.
Response:  We know that Steven has 11 jabok and 18 bruskev. To find out how many more bruskev he has than jabok, we need to subtract the number of jabok from the total number of bruskev. So, if we subtract 11 from 18, we get 7. Therefore, Steven has 7 more bruskev than jabok.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 more bananas than Steven. So, if Steven has x bananas and Jake has 3x bananas, then we can write an equation as follows:  Bananas = x + 3(x)  Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:  Bananas = 19 + 3(15)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Bananas = 27  Therefore, Steven has 8 more bananas than Jake.
Response:  If she spent $78 at the store and paid $15 for parking, that means she spent a total of $93. So, if she had $78 initially, she would have $25 left over ($78 - $93 = $25).
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and has $33 left, that means she had $101 to start with ($78 + $33 = $101).
Response:  The initial amount of money was $100. After paying with an automated teller machine (ATM), she received $148 more. So, the total amount of money she had after visiting the supermarket is: $100 + $148 = $248. Therefore, she spent $248 - $100 = $148 at the supermarket.
Response:  The woman had $3 in her wallet and withdrew an additional $49 from the ATM. After visiting the supermarket, she had $49 left. So, she withdrew $49 more than she spent at the supermarket. Therefore, the answer is $49.
Response:  The woman had $53 at first and then got $91 from an ATM. So she had $144 ($53 + $91). Then she spent some money at the supermarket, but we don't know how much. Therefore, the amount of money she spent at the supermarket is equal to the difference between her initial amount of money and what she had left after buying something there. In other words, if she spent x dollars at the supermarket, then she would have had $144 - x dollars left. Since she had $144 initially and only $14 left after shopping, we can conclude that she spent $130 at the supermarket ($144 - $14 = $130).
Response:  We know that $106 was spent at the store and after visiting both stores, there is $26 left. If she spent $49 at the market, then we can calculate how much she spent at the store as follows: $26 - $49 = -$23. So, she did not spend any money at the store.
Response:  If she spent $29 at the store and had $54 in cash before going to the store, then she must have had $85 - $29 = $56 left after buying something at the store.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in cash, then she must have had $90 left after buying those items ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 applications left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  At first, Dave had 18 applications on his phone and then he deleted 13 of them, leaving him with 5 applications. So initially, Dave had 5 applications on his phone (not including the ones he downloaded later).
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones. So, his total number of applications is now 21 (10 + 11). After deleting some of them, he has 4 left. Therefore, Dave deleted 17 applications (21 - 4 = 17).
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and added 89 new ones. So, his total number of applications is now 21 + 89 = 106. Then we are told that after selecting some he has 24 left. Therefore, the number of applications he selected is 106 - 24 = 82.  So, Dave added 89 new applications and selected 82 of them.
Response:  If Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially and added 71 new ones, then he has a total of 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). Now, if he deleted some of them after adding the new ones, let's say he deleted 20, then he would have 66 applications left (86 - 20 = 66). So, the number of applications that he deleted is equal to the number of applications he added minus the total number of applications he had before adding any new ones. In this case, it is 71 - 66 = 5. Therefore, Dave deleted 5 applications.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with only 5 applications and 23 files. So, we can conclude that Dave deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 3 applications and 7 files. So, we can calculate how many files were deleted as follows: Number of files deleted = Total number of files - Remaining number of files = 21 - 7 = 14 files. Therefore, Dave deleted 14 files from his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially. After choosing some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, we can calculate how many applications are left as follows: Number of applications = Total number of applications - Number of chosen applications = 15 - (21 + 4) = 15 - 25 = -10 applications. Therefore, there are -10 applications on Dave's phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. So, we can calculate how many more files than applications are remaining on his phone as follows: Number of files = 15 - 6 = 9 Number of applications = 6 Therefore, there are 9 more files than applications on Dave's phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications before adding some more, then he has 17 + x where x is the number of additional applications he added. So, if he now has 18 applications in total, we can set up an equation as follows: 17 + x = 18  Solving for x, we get:  x = 1  Therefore, Dave added 1 application to his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and applications on his phone before deleting some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. So, we can conclude that Dave deleted 47 files (59 - 30 = 47) and 3 applications (12 - 15 = 3).
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and applications on his phone before deleting some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 17 applications and 21 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 7 files (24 - 21 = 3) and 7 applications (24 - 17 = 7).
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone initially. After choosing some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of applications = Total number of applications - Number of chosen applications Number of files = Total number of files - Number of chosen files In this case, the total number of applications is 24, and the number of chosen applications is 12. Therefore, the number of applications remaining after selecting some of them is 24 - 12 = 12. Similarly, the total number of files is 9, and the number of chosen files is 5. So, the number of files remaining after selecting some of them is 9 - 5 = 4. Now, let's substitute these values into the equations above to find out how many applications are left on Dave's phone: Number of applications = 12 Number of files = 4 Therefore, there are 12 applications and 4 files left on Dave's phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, the number of files on his phone now is 24 - 3 = 21. And the number of applications after deletion is 2. Therefore, there are more files than applications on Dave's phone still. The difference between the total number of files and applications is 21 - 2 = 19.
Response:  We know that Jeff got 136 of Nell's baseball cards. So, if he got x number of cards from her, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of cards Nell has = Total number of cards - Number of cards Jeff got.  In this case, the total number of cards is given to be 242. Substituting this value into our equation and solving for x, we get:  Number of cards Nell has = 242 - 136 = 106. Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.
Response:  We know that Jeff has 301 baseball cards and now he has 154 left. So, if we subtract the number of cards Jeff had from the total number of cards he received (301), we get: 301 - 154 = 147. Therefore, Nell had 147 baseball cards at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, we can calculate how many cards Nell gave to Jeff as follows: Number of cards given to Jeff = Total number of cards - Number of cards left with Nell = 528 - 252 = 276 cards. Therefore, Nell gave 276 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 535 cards left. So, we can calculate how many cards Jeff got from Nell as follows: Number of cards Jeff got = Total number of cards Nell had - Number of cards Nell has now = 566 - 535 = 31 Therefore, Jeff currently has 31 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she now has 415 - 309 = 126 baseball cards left. Since she also has 149 cards with ten, we can add these to her total number of baseball cards. Therefore, Nell has 126 + 149 = 275 baseball cards more than 10.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 404 baseball cards plus whatever number of cards she gave to Jeff. So let's call that number x. Since she also had 214 cards of the other set, we can say that her total number of cards is 404 + x = 618. Therefore, the difference between the number of baseball cards Nell had before giving any to Jeff (246) and the total number of cards she now has (618) is equal to 372. So, Nell has 372 more baseball cards than she did originally.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards and gave 195 to John. So she has 378 left (573 - 195 = 378). Now we are told that she gave some of them to Jeff as well. Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the number of cards she has left minus the number of cards she gave to John. In this case, it would be 378 - 195 = 183. So, Nell gave 183 baseball cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Jeff got some of Nell's cards and now he has 55 cards with number 10 and 178 baseball cards. So, we can write an equation to represent this information: Number of baseball cards Nell had = 438 - Number of cards Jeff got = 178 Now, let's find out how many more baseball cards Nell had than she gave to Jeff. To do this, subtract the number of cards Jeff got from the total number of baseball cards Nell had: Number of baseball cards Nell had after giving them to Jeff = 438 - 178 = 260 Therefore, Nell had more than 260 baseball cards beyond what she gave to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she now has 376 - 239 = 137 baseball cards left.  Then we are told that she also has 111 basketball cards. Therefore, the difference between the number of baseball cards and basketball cards is:  137 - 111 = 26 baseball cards more than basketball cards.  So, Nell has 26 more baseball cards than basketball cards.
Response:  We know that Paco had 19 pencils and he gave away 35 of them. So, initially, Paco had x = 19 pencils. Since he gave away 35 pencils, we can write an equation: x - 35 = 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 54. Therefore, Paco initially had 54 pencils.
Response:  We know that Paco had 28 pencils initially and he ate some of them. So, we can write an equation: 28 - x = 7 where x is the number of pencils Paco ate. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 28: x = 7 / 28. Therefore, Paco ate 3 pencils.
Response:  Paco had 40 pencils initially. Two of them were eaten, so he had 40 - 2 = 38 left. Then, he bought 37 more pencils, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 pencils in total. Therefore, Paco had 75 pencils at the end.
Response:  Paco had 25 pencils and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 left. Then, he bought 3 more pencils. So, now he has 20 + 3 = 23 pencils. Therefore, he ate more than he bought.
Response:  Paco had 13 marbles initially and he gave away 2 of them. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 marbles left. Then, he bought 36 more marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles that Paco has is 11 + 36 = 47 marbles.
Response:  If Paco had 40 pebbles and he gave 5 to his friend, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 pebbles left. Then, if he gave 13 pebbles to other friends, he has 35 - 13 = 22 pebbles left. So, Paco had 22 pebbles at the end.
Response:  Paco has 17 pebbles and gives 13 to his friend. So he still has 4 pebbles left (17 - 13 = 4).
Response:  Paco had 12 pebbles and gave away 21 to his friend. So he has 12 - 21 = -9 left. Then he ate 16 pebbles, so now he has -9 + 16 = 7 remaining pebbles. Therefore, he gave more than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had 22 sweet peanuts and 75 salty ones initially. If he ate 15 sweet peanuts and 54 salty ones, then we can calculate how many peanuts he had left as follows: Number of sweet peanuts = Initial number - Amount eaten = 22 - 15 = 7 Number of salty peanuts = Initial number - Amount eaten = 75 - 54 = 21 So, Paco had 7 sweet peanuts and 21 salty peanuts left after eating some of them.
Response:  We know that Paco had 9 sweet peanuts and he ate 36 of them. So, he had 9 - 36 = 27 sweet peanuts left. Now, we are told that he also ate 3 slaty peanuts. Therefore, he had 27 + 3 = 30 slaty peanuts left. Since he ate some both sweet and salty peanuts, he must have started with an equal number of each type. Hence, he had 9 salty peanuts initially.  Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Paco had 37 sweet and 11 salty peanuts. He ate 5 sweet and 2 salty peanuts. So, we can calculate how many more sweet peanuts he ate than salty peanuts as follows: Number of sweet peanuts eaten = 5 - 2 = 3 More sweet peanuts were eaten than salty peanuts. Therefore, there are 3 more sweet peanuts than salty peanuts.
Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet and 6 salty crackers. He ate 20 of the sweet crackers and 34 of the salty ones. So, we can write an equation: Sweet crackers eaten = 20 Salty crackers eaten + 6 To find out how many more salty crackers he ate than sweet crackers, we need to subtract the number of sweet crackers from the total number of salty crackers: Number of salty crackers eaten - Number of sweet crackers eaten = 34 - 20 = 14 Therefore, Paco ate 14 more salty crackers than sweet crackers.
Response:  If Paco had 36 pebbles and then got one more (37), that means he now has 1 more pebble than before, which is 38 pebbles in total. So, Paco had 38 pebbles.
Response:  If Paco had 36 pencils and gave 14 to his friend, then he has 36 - 14 = 22 pencils left. Then, if he divided them equally among 10 people, each person would get 22 / 10 = 2 pencils. So, Paco had 2 pencils left originally.
Response:  Paco has 41 pips and gives 9 to his friend. So he has 32 pips left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he eats 18 pips, leaving him with 14 pips (32 - 18 = 14). Therefore, Paco has more than 9 pips than his friend. The difference is 5 pips (14 - 9 = 5).
Response:  Paco had six pencils and gave three to his friend. So he has three left (6 - 3 = 3). Then, he ate 23 of them, which means that now he has 3 - 23 = -19 pencils. Since it can't be negative, we know that Paco gave more pencils to his friend than he ate. Therefore, the number of pencils he gave to his friend is greater than 23.
Response:  We know that Paco had 97 salty peanuts and 34 sweet peanuts initially. If he ate 15 sweet peanuts, then he has 34 - 15 = 19 sweet peanuts left. Similarly, if he ate 56 salty peanuts, then he has 97 - 56 = 41 salty peanuts left. So, Paco had 41 salty peanuts and 19 sweet peanuts at the end.
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 salt and 17 sweet peanuts initially.  He ate 14 sweet peanuts, so he has 13 (26 - 14) left.  Now, he ate 9 salty peanuts, leaving him with 4 (13 - 9). So, Paco had 4 salty peanuts at the end.
Response:  We know that Paco had 39 sweet and 6 salty peanuts initially. He ate 23 salty peanuts and 32 sweet peanuts afterward. So, we can calculate how many more sweet peanuts he ate than salty ones as follows: Number of sweet peanuts eaten = 32 - 23 = 9 More sweet peanuts were eaten than salty ones. Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet peanuts eaten and the number of salty peanuts eaten is 9.
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 sweet and 25 salty peanuts. He ate 28 salty and 15 sweet peanuts. So, we can write an equation: Sweet peanuts = 15 - (Salty peanuts eaten / Total number of salty peanuts) Salty peanuts = 28 - (Sweet peanuts eaten / Total number of sweet peanuts) Now, let's solve for the difference between the number of salty peanuts he ate and the total number of salty peanuts: Difference = Salty peanuts eaten - Total number of salty peanuts = 28 - 40 = -12 Therefore, Paco ate fewer salty peanuts than he had initially. The difference is -12.
Response:  If she received $7 and spent some of it, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $2. Therefore, she spent $2.
Response:  If she received some dollars for her birthday and then spent $8, that means she has $6 left. So, she received $6 + $8 = $14.
Response:  If she received $2 from her mom and her dad gave her an additional $4, then she has a total of $6 so far ($2 + $4).  If she spent $3, then she would have $3 left ($6 - $3 = $3). Therefore, the correct answer is $3.
Response:  If she received $8 from her mom and her dad gave her an additional $5, then together they gave her $13 ($8 + $5).  If she spent $4 of that amount, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, she received more money from her mom than from her dad.
Response:  The mother gave her $3, and the father gave her $6, so in total she received $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4 of it, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). So, she got more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  The girl received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, so she has a total of $12 ($5 + $7). If she spent $4, then she has $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). So, the girl received more money from her mother than from her father.
Response:  The father gave her $5 and the mother gave her $2 more, so she received a total of $7 from them. Therefore, she got $7 from the father and $2 from the mother, for a total of $9.
Response:  If Josh had initially 9 marbles in his collection and lost some of them, then he has fewer marbles now. We are told that he has 4 marbles left, so we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Number of marbles = Initial number of marbles - Number of marbles lost  In this case, the initial number of marbles is 9 (since Josh started with 9), and the number of marbles lost is unknown but less than or equal to 9 (since Josh still has some marbles left). So, we can set up the equation as follows:  Number of marbles = 9 - x  Where x represents the number of marbles lost. Now, we are asked how many marbles Josh lost. To find out, we need to solve for x in the above equation:  x = 9 - Number of marbles  Since Josh has 4 marbles left, we can substitute this value into the equation:  x = 9 - 4  x = 5  Therefore, Josh lost 5 marbles.
"Response:  If Josh had x kroglic in his collection and lost 21 of them, then he has left with x - 21 kroglic. Since he now has 12 pieces of candy, we can set up an equation as follows:
x - 21 = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 33
So, Josh had 33 kroglic in his collection before losing any."
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 cigarettes in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them and found 5 new ones. So, we need to find out how many cigarettes Josh has now. We know that after losing 11 cigarettes, he had 19 - 11 = 8 remaining cigarettes. And then he found 5 new ones, so he has 8 + 5 = 13 cigarettes left in his collection. Therefore, Josh currently has 13 cigarettes in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 4 marbles initially and lost 16 of them, then he has left with 4 - 16 = -12 marbles. Since he found 8 new marbles, his final number of marbles is -12 + 8 = -4 marbles. So, Josh lost more marbles than he found.
Response:  If Josh had seven marbles initially and lost 8 of them, he would have 7 - 8 = 9 marbles left. Then, he found 10 new marbles, so his total number of marbles is now 9 + 10 = 19 marbles. Therefore, Josh has more marbles than he originally had (19 > 7). So, the answer to the question is 19 - 7 = 12.
"Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 remaining marbles. So, he now has 14 koščkov (Slovenian for ""marbles"")."
Response:  Josh had 20 marbles in his collection and gave two marbles to Jack. So, he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left.
Response:  If Josh had 22 kroglic in his collection and Jack gave him 20 more, then he has 20 + 22 = 42 kroglic now. So, Josh has 42 kroglic in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 19 pieces of candy in his collection and lost 11 of them, he would have 8 remaining pieces (19 - 11 = 8). So, he has 8 pieces of candy left in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had initially 22 candies and he found 13 of them, then he has 9 remaining (22 - 13 = 9). Now, if he lost 5 candies, he will have 4 left (9 - 5 = 4). So, Josh now has 4 candies in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 marbles in his collection and found 9 of them to be jade, then he has 6 remaining marbles (15 - 9 = 6).  Now, if he lost 23 marbles, then he has lost more than he found (6 - 9 = -3) marbles. So, Josh lost 3 marbles more than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had three balls in his collection initially and found six chocolates. So, he gained six chocolates. Now, we are told that he lost five chocolates. Therefore, the final number of chocolates Josh has is equal to the initial number minus the number he lost. In this case, the initial number was three, so the final number of chocolates Josh has is three - 5 = -2. Since negative numbers cannot be used to represent the amount of chocolate someone has, we can conclude that Josh did not find any additional chocolates. He actually ended up with fewer chocolates than he started with.
"Response:  If Marco has 2 kg of apples and his parents have together 4 kg of apples, then we can calculate how much more or less Marco has than his parents as follows:

Marco's weight = 2 kg
Parents' weight = 4 kg - 2 kg = 2 kg

So, Marco's apples are 2 kg more than his parents'. Therefore, Marco's apples weigh 4 kg - 2 kg = 2 kg more than his parents'."
Response:  We know that Marco has 13 kg of apples and his father together with him have 35 kg of apples. So, we can calculate how much more do his father's apples weight than Marco's: 35 kg - 13 kg = 22 kg. Therefore, his father's apples weigh 22 kg more than Marco's.
Response:  We know that Marco's father and mother together have 20 kg of apples. Tacyeva's apple weighed 17 kg. So, if Marco had x kg of apples, then he would have 20-17 = 3 kg of apples. Therefore, Marco had 3 kg of apples.
Response:  If Marco's apple weighed 8 kg and his father's apple weighed 32 kg, then together they weigh 40 kg (8 + 32 = 40). So, their apples together weigh 40 kg.
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father together collected 24 kg of apples. Then, on their way back, Marco lost 9 kg of apples. So, now he has 2 kg + 9 kg = 11 kg of apples left with him. Therefore, the weight of apples that Marco's father had is equal to 24 kg - 11 kg = 13 kg.
"Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 36 kg of apples, then Marco had 2 kg of apples left after he lost some on the way back. So, if his father had x kg of apples initially, then we can write an equation based on the information given:
x + 2 = 36
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 34
So, Marco's father originally had 34 kg of apples."
Response:  Firstly, Marco's father found additional 30 kg of apples during their journey back home. So, now he has 30 + 22 = 52 kg of apples altogether. Since Marco had 13 kg of apples initially and his father added more, we can conclude that Marco's share of the total amount is equal to 13/52 x 52 = 7.69 kg. Therefore, the weight of the apples owned by Marco's father is 52 - 7.69 = 44.31 kg.
Response:  We know that Marco's father's bag of apples weighs 5 kg and together their bags of apples weigh 37 kg. So if Marco's father has x kg of apples, then he must have (37 - 5) = 32 kg less than his father. Therefore, Marco's father has 32 kg of apples.
Response:  We know that Marco's apple weighs 30 kg and his parents' apples together weigh 17 ft. So, to find out how much more Marcos' apples weigh than his parents', we can subtract their weight from each other: 30 kg - (17 ft x 2) = 13 kg Therefore, Marco's apples are 13 kg heavier than his parents'.
Response:  We know that Marco had 5 kg of apples and his father had some apples too. So, let's assume that his father had x kg of apples. Since they both went to pick apples together, we can say that their total weight of apples is equal to the sum of their individual weights: 26 lb = 5 kg + x kg. Now, we need to find out how much heavier are his father's apples than Marco's. To do this, we divide the difference between their weights by Marco's weight: (x - 5) / 5 = 11 kg. Therefore, his father's apples were 11 kg heavier than Marco's.
Response:  We know that Marco's father and his father have gone to pick apples together. The weight of Marco's father's apples is given as 4 kg. If they together weigh 30 pounds (or 13.6 kg), then the weight of Marco's father's apples is 4/7 or 57% of the total weight. Therefore, the weight of Marco's apples would be 30 - 57 = 23 kg. So, Marco's apples weighed 23 kg.
Response:  At the station, there were initially two children in the bus. Then, more children got on the bus at the station. So, after the station, there were 8 children in the bus (2 + however many new children got on). Finally, when all the children reached their destination, there were 10 children in the bus altogether (8 original + 2 new). Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus after the station is 2 (the difference between the total number of children and the number of children originally in the bus).
Response:  We know that there were initially 26 children in the bus and then 14 more got off at the stop. So, the total number of children left in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off. Therefore, we can write: Number of children remaining = Initial number - Number who got off Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children remaining = 26 - 14 = 12 So, there are currently 12 children in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were some children in the bus (we don't know how many). Then two more children got into the bus at the stop (so now we have 2 + x = 41, where x is the initial number of children). Now we need to find out what x was initially. Since there were already some children in the bus, we can assume that x > 0. Moreover, since the total number of children in the bus is equal to the sum of those who got off plus those who remained, we can write: x + 2 = 41. Solving for x, we get: x = 39. So, initially, there were 39 children in the bus before getting off at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus and after they got off at the station, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, we can calculate how many children got off the bus as follows: Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children remaining in the bus = 43 - 21 = 22 Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the station.
Response:  We know that there were initially 41 children in the bus and they got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off at the stop. Therefore, we have: Number of children remaining = Initial number - Number who got off at the stop  In this case, the initial number was 41 and the number who got off at the stop was 18. So, we can calculate the number of children remaining as follows: Number of children remaining = 41 - 18 = 23  Therefore, there were 23 children left in the bus after all the children had gotten off at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus and then 10 of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Then, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number to 16. Therefore, the number of children at the bus stop is 11 + 6 = 17.
Response:  We know that there were 63 children who got off at the bus stop and 14 children who remained in the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus is 63 + 14 = 77. Now we need to find out how many more children were in the bus than got off. To do this, we subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children in the bus: 77 - 63 = 14. Therefore, there were 14 more children in the bus than got off.
Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and 68 got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is: 36 - 68 = -32. Therefore, 32 children remained in the bus after some got off.
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children in the bus and then 40 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 22 + 40 = 62. Now, we are told that two children remained in the bus after it stopped. Therefore, the number of children who got off at the stop is 62 - 2 = 60.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 28 + 82 = 110. Now, we are told that there were 30 children in the bus afterward. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of children in the bus and the final number of children in the bus is 110 - 30 = 80. Hence, there were 80 more children in the bus than the number of children who got off at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children in the bus and then 24 children got on the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after they all got on is 23 + 24 = 47 children. Now, we are told that some of them got off the bus later. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children already in the bus minus the final number of children in the bus. In this case, the final number of children in the bus is 8, so the number of children who got off the bus is 47 - 8 = 39 children. Thus, 39 children got off the bus.
Response:  If Pečar made 133 tortes and sold 51 of them, then he must have made 82 more tortes than those that were sold (133 - 51 = 82). So, the number of tortes that Pečar made is equal to the number of tortes that he sold plus 82 (82 + 51 = 133). Therefore, Pečar made 133 tortes.
Response:  If Pečar has made 54 tarts and sold some of them, then he must have had more than 54 at first. So let x be the number of tarts that Pečar initially had. Then we know that x - 13 = 54, since he sold 13 tarts. Solving for x, we get x = 67. Therefore, Pečar sold 13 tarts.
Response:  If Pečar has sold 145 tarts and he had initially made 72 of them, then he must have made additional 73 tarts (since he did not sell all the initial 72). So, in total, Pečar has made 73 + 72 = 145 tarts.
Response:  If Pečar has made 155 tarts and his friend buys 140 from him, then he still has 15 - (140 / 2) = 35 tarts left. So, Baker still has 35 tarts.
Response:  If Pečar made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, that means he has 16 (121 - 105) remaining tarts. Then, if he bought 170 new tarts, it means he now has 36 (16 + 170) tarts left. So, the number of tarts Baker has is 36.
Response:  We know that Pečar has made 13 cakes and sold 91 of them. So he has 48 left (13 - 91 = 48). Now we are told that Baker has bought 154 new cakes. This means that Baker has bought all the remaining cakes from Pečar (48 + 154 = 202). Therefore, Baker has bought 202 cakes more than those he sold. In other words, Baker has bought 163 fewer cakes than he sold (202 - 91 = 163).
Response:  If Pečar made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them, then he must have had 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Now, if he bought 31 new tarts, that means he has 63 tarts left after buying (92 - 31 = 63). So, he sold more tarts than he bought. The difference between the number of tarts he sold and the number he bought is 78 - 31 = 47. Therefore, Pečar sold 47 more tarts than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. Then he made another 76 tarts. So, in total, the baker has 110 + 76 = 186 tarts left. Therefore, the baker still has 75 - 186 = -111 tarts.
Response:  The pastry chef made 144 tarts and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 tarts. So in total, the pastry chef made 255 tarts (144 + 111). Therefore, the number of tarts that the pastry chef produced is 255 - 71 = 184 more than the number of tarts he sold.
Response:  If he has made 149 tarts and 91 pies, that means he has a total of 230 pastries (149 + 91 = 230).  If he sells 10 tarts and 90 pies, then he will have 220 pastries left (230 - 10 = 220).
Response:  If he sold 15 tarts and 103 pies, then he would have fewer pies left. So, if he had 148 pies to start with, after selling 15 tarts and 103 pies, he would have 131 pies left.
"Response:  We know that Pečar has made 126 tarts and 48 pies. If he sold 115 tarts and 81 pies, then we can calculate how many more tarts he made than he sold as follows:

Number of tarts Pečar made - Number of tarts he sold = Number of extra tarts he made
= 126 - 115 = 11

So, Pečar made 11 additional tarts beyond what he sold."
Response:  We know that Pečar has made 19 tarts and 131 pies. If he sold 70 tarts and 88 pies, then we can calculate how many more pies he made than tarts as follows: Number of pies Pečar made - Number of tarts Pečar sold = Number of additional pies Pečar made  In this case, number of additional pies is equal to 53 (131-70). Therefore, Pechar has made 53 more pies than tarts.
Response:  According to the question, pechar has made 157 tarts and 169 pies. If he sold 158 tarts and 147 pies, then he sold more tarts than he made. So, the number of tarts that pechar sold is equal to the difference between the number of tarts he made and the number of tarts he sold. Therefore, the number of tarts that pechar sold is 157 - 158 = -1 tart. Similarly, if pechar sold more pies than he made, then the number of pies he sold is equal to the difference between the number of pies he made and the number of pies he sold. Therefore, the number of pies that pechar sold is 169 - 147 = 22 pies.
Response:  We know that the baker made 54 tarts and 143 pieces of bread. If he sold 68 tarts and 92 pieces of bread, then we can calculate how many more pieces of bread he sold as follows: Number of pieces of bread sold = Total number of pieces of bread - Number of pieces of bread sold = 143 - 92 = 51 pieces of bread So, the baker sold 51 additional pieces of bread compared to what he initially had.
Response:  If he sold 44 tarts and then made 48 more, he would have 44 + 48 = 92 tarts in total. So, he still has 92 tarts left.
Response:  If he first made 40 cakes and then sold 8 of them, that means he has 40 - 8 = 32 left. So, he produced more than he sold.
"Response:  If Pećarjevi friend bought 137 tortic from him and he had initially 169 kolačev (croissants), then we can calculate how many kolačev he would have left as follows:

Initially, Pećarjevi friend had 169 kolačev, and he sold 137 of them to his friend. So, now Pećarjevi friend has:

169 - 137 = 32 kolačev

Therefore, Pećarjevi friend has 32 kolačev left."
Response:  If Pečar made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones, then he has 70 (173 - 103) tart left. He sold 86 tarts, so now he has 70 - 86 = 44 tarts left. Therefore, Baker still has 44 tarts.
Response:  We know that Pečar has made 99 cakes and sold 89 of them. Therefore, he must have had some left over. Let's assume that he had x number of cakes left after selling 89. Then we know that he bought new cakes (167 - 99 = 68) more than he sold. So, the number of cakes he bought is equal to the number of cakes he had left plus the number of cakes he bought (x + 68). Now, we need to find out what value can replace the variable 'x'. From the information given in the passage, we know that Pečar has 99 cakes left after selling 89. Therefore, if he buys 68 new cakes, then he will have 31 cakes left (99 - 68 = 31). So, the value of 'x' is 31. Hence, Baker bought 31 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  If Pečar made 8 tarts and bought 139 new ones, then he has a total of 139 + 8 = 147 tarts.  If he sold 145 tarts, then he had 145 - 147 = -2 more tarts than he sold. So, he sold fewer tarts than he had. Therefore, the correct answer is -2.
"Response:  The baker made 62 tarts first and then added another 149 tarts later. He sold 144 of them in total. So, the number of tarts he still has is:

Total number of tarts = First batch + Second batch - Sold tarts
= 62 + 149 - 144
= 73

Therefore, the baker still has 73 tarts left."
Response:  The pastry chef made 81 tortes and then made an additional 92 tortes. So in total he made 81 + 92 = 173 tortes. Since he sold 46 of them, that means he has 173 - 46 = 127 tortes left over. Therefore, the number of tortes the pastry chef made more than those he sold is 127.
Response:  If he sold 108 tortes and 44 peci, then he would have less of both left. So, if he had x tortes and y peci before selling them, after selling them he would have x - 108 and y - 44. Since he has to have at least one of each (tortes or peci), we can write an equation: x + y >= 108 and x + y >= 44. Solving for x and y gives us: x = 235 and y = 97. Therefore, he still has 235 tortes and 97 peci.
Response:  If he sold 104 tortes and 29 peci, then he would have 75 remaining peci (124 - 29 = 75). So, he still has 75 peci left.
Response:  We know that Pečar has made 52 pies and 84 tarts. If he sold 102 tarts and 94 pie, then we can calculate how many more tarts he made than he sold as follows: Number of tarts Pechar made - Number of tarts he sold = 102 - 94 = 8. So, Pechar made 8 more tarts than he sold.
Response:  We know that Pečar has sold 140 tarts and 92 pies. If he had made more than what he sold, then he must have produced more pies than tarts. So, if he made 134 pies and 11 tarts, then he must have produced additional 5 pies (since 134 - 92 = 42). Therefore, Pečar produced 5 more pies than what he sold.
Response:  If he sold 8 pie tins and 97 tortes, then he had 153 - 8 = 145 tortes left. So, he sold more tortes than he had at first.
Response:  We know that Pečar has sold 154 peciv and 78 tortes. So, if he had only baked those, then he would have sold all of them. But we also know that Baker has sold more than Pečar. Therefore, there must be some number of peciv or tortes that Pečar did not sell but Baker did. Let's assume that Baker sold x additional peciv and y additional tortes beyond what Pečar sold. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Total peciv sold = 154 + x ( since Baker sold x additional peciv) Total tortes sold = 78 + y (since Baker sold y additional tortes) Now, let's substitute these equations into each other to eliminate one variable: Total peciv sold = 154 + x Total tortes sold = 78 + y Subtracting total peciv sold from both sides gives us: x = 76 ( since Pečar sold 43 peciv and Baker sold 33 additional peciv) Substituting this value back into the first equation gives us: Total peciv sold = 154 + 76 = 230 Since Pečar sold 43 peciv and Baker sold 33 additional peciv, Baker sold 9 peciv more than Pečar. Similarly, substituting the values back into the second equation gives us: Total tortes sold = 78 + 33 = 111 Since Pečar sold 78 tortes and Baker sold 33 additional tortes, Baker sold 45 tortes more than Pečar. Therefore, the answer is: Baker sold 9 peciv and 45 tortes more than Pečar.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she wants to have 140 games in total, then we need to find out how many more games she needs to buy.  To do this, we can divide the number of games she wants (140) by the number of games she already has (22):

Number of additional games = 140 - 22 = 118
So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to reach her goal of having 140 games in total."
Response:  If Kelly had 106 Nintendo games and gave away 64 of them, then she has 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games.
Response:  At first, Kelly had 91 Nintendo games. If she now has 92 games, that means she gained one game. So, initially, Kelly had 91 games.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly will have if she wants to have 12 of them, we can use division. So, we divide the number of Nintendo games Kelly has (20) by the number of Nintendo games she wants to have (12): 20 / 12 = 16. Therefore, Kelly will have 16 Nintendo games.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to have 31 more Sony games. So, we need to find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to give away to get the desired number of Sony games.  To do this, we can divide the number of Sony games Kelly wants (31) by the number of Sony games she already has (46):  Number of Sony games Kelly needs = Desired number of Sony games / Current number of Sony games  Number of Sony games Kelly needs = 31 / 46  Number of Sony games Kelly needs = 0.67 or approximately 7  Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 7 Sony games to get the desired number of Sony games.
Response:  If Kelly has already collected 80 Nintendo games and she found 31 more, then she now has a total of 111 games. To find out how many games she needs to give away to have 6 more games, we can subtract the number of games she already has from the desired number of games: 111 - 6 = 105. So, Kelly needs to give away 105 games to have 6 more games.
"Response:  If Randy had initially 52 blocks and he used them to build a tower of height x, then we know that the number of blocks left after building the tower is equal to x - 38. So, if we want to find out how many blocks Randy had at first, we can set up an equation as follows:

x - 38 = 52

Solving for x, we get:

x = 90

So, Randy had 52 blocks at the beginning."
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he is building a tower (stolp). If he uses all of his blocks to build the tower, then he will have used 97 blocks in total. However, we are also given that there are now 72 blocks left over after building the tower. So, if Randy used all 97 blocks to build the tower, then he must have built the tower using 97 / 72 = 13 blocks. Therefore, Randy used 13 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 14 blocks for the tower and 11 blocks for the house. So, we have to subtract these numbers from the total number of blocks he had (79). Therefore, the remaining number of blocks is: 79 - 14 - 11 = 54 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 27 blocks to build the tower and 53 blocks to build the house. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building the tower = 27 Number of blocks used for building the house = 53 Now, we need to find out how many blocks Randy used in total to build both the tower and the house. To do this, we simply add the number of blocks he used for each structure together: Total number of blocks used = Number of blocks used for building the tower + Number of blocks used for building the house In this case, we have: Total number of blocks used = 27 + 53 = 80 Therefore, Randy used 80 blocks in total to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks and he used 33 of them to build a tower and 13 for building a house. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building a tower = 33 Blocks used for building a house = 13 Now let's solve this equation. To do so, we need to divide the number of blocks used for building a tower by the number of blocks used for building a house. In this case, we have: Number of blocks used for building a tower = 33 Blocks used for building a house = 13 Therefore, we can see that Randy used more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house. Specifically, he used 33 blocks to build the tower and only 13 blocks to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks and he used 79 of them to build the tower and 82 for building the house. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building the house = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for building the tower. Now we substitute the values given in the problem: Number of blocks used for building the house = 86 - 79 = 8. Therefore, Randy used 8 more blocks to build the house than he did for building the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy used 36 blocks to build the tower. So, if he had 59 blocks in total, then we can calculate how many he used as follows: Number of blocks used = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower  Number of blocks used = 59 - 36  Number of blocks used = 23 Therefore, there are 23 blocks left over after Randy built the tower with 36 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks and he used 20 of them to build a house and 50 of them to build a tower. So, we can write this as an equation:  Number of blocks used for building a house = 20  Number of blocks used for building a tower = 50 Now, let's solve for the difference between the number of blocks used for building the tower and the number of blocks used for building the house: Difference = Tower - House = 50 - 20 = 30 Therefore, Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy used 90 blocks to build the house and 89 blocks for its construction. Therefore, we can say that he used one more block than he did for building the tower (63). So, the number of blocks used for building the house is greater than the number of blocks used for building the tower by 1 block.  Therefore, the correct answer is: The difference between the number of blocks used for building the house and the number of blocks used for building the tower is equal to 1 block.
"Response:  If there are 20 different books in the series ""Nori, the Clumsy Schoolboy"", and you have not read five of them yet, then you must have already read at least 15 books from the series. Therefore, your answer is 15."
"Response:  If there are currently 13 books in the series and you still need to read 8 more, then the total number of books in the series is: 13 + 8 = 21. Therefore, there are 21 books in the ""Norwegian School"" series."
Response:  If there are 22 books and 10 movies in the series, that means you have already read 12 books and watched 56 movies. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books in the series: 22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, you still need to read 10 more books.
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 films in total. If you have read 19 books, then you still need to watch 8 more films (17 - 19 = 8). So, you need to watch 8 more films.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""Nori School"". If we have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, then we can conclude that there are more books than movies in the series. Specifically, there are 7 more books (19 - 12 = 7) than movies (13). Therefore, the answer is 7 more books than movies in the series ""Nori School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""Nori, Neumann School"". If we have read 19 books and watched 61 films, then we can calculate how many more films than books there are in the series as follows: Number of films = 61 - 8 = 53 Number of books = 19 Therefore, there are 53 films more than books in the series ""Nori, Neumann School""."
"Response:  If there are 10 books and 11 films in the series, that means we have:

Books: 10 x 1 = 10
Films: 11 x 1 = 11

If you read 13 books and watched 12 films, it means you have:

Read Books: 13 - 10 = 3 more books than the number of films
Watched Films: 12 - 11 = 1 more film than the number of books

So, you have read 3 more books than the number of films you watched."
"Response:  If there are 11 books and 17 films in the series, that means we have a total of:

11 + 17 = 28 items in the series.

If you have read 7 books and watched 21 films, then you have not watched all the films in the series. To find out how many films you have watched, we can divide the number of films you have watched (21) by the total number of films in the series (28):

21 / 28 = 0.75 or approximately 7.5 films.

Therefore, if you have read 7 books and watched 7.5 films from the series, you have not watched all the films in the series."
"Response:  If there are 14 different books in the series ""Northern School"", and you have already read 8 of them, then you still need to read 6 more books."
Response:  If there are 62 different films and 19 different books in the series, that means there are 62 + 19 = 81 different media items in total.  Since you have already read four books and watched 34 films, that means you still need to read 81 - 4 = 77 more books.
Response:  We know that there are 8 films in the series and we have read 7 books. So, if we want to watch all 8 films, we still need to watch one more film. Therefore, the answer is 8 - 7 = 1.
Response:  We know that there are 11 books read and 40 movies watched. If we subtract the number of movies watched from the total number of books, we get:  Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of movies watched  Number of books left = 11 - 40 = -29 books In other words, there are 29 more books in the series than what has been read or watched so far.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 books and 63 movies in the series ""Nori, the clumsy schoolboy"". If we have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, then we can conclude that there are more movies than books in the series. Specifically, there are 50 movies more than books (63 - 13 = 50). Therefore, the answer is 50."
Response:  If there are 10 books and 6 films in the series, that means we have a total of 10 + 6 = 16 items in the series.  If you have read 14 films and watched 19 books, then you have read more books than films. Therefore, the number of books you have read is greater than the number of films you have watched. So, the answer is 19.
Response:  If there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series, that means there are 8 + 5 = 13 items in total.  If you have read 19 films and watched 16 books, then you have not seen all of the movies or read all of the books in the series. Therefore, the number of movies you have seen is 19 - 16 = 3.
Response:  If Dave has already used 7 tickets to buy players and he still has 2 remaining tickets left, then he must have used 7 of his total 9 tickets (he had 9 tickets in total). So, he used 7/9 = 3/4 of his tickets for buying players. Therefore, he has 6/9 = 2/3 of his original tickets left, which is equal to 2 remaining tickets.
Response:  If Dave has already used 12 tickets to buy toys and he still has 14 left, that means he must have had 14 + 12 = 26 tickets in total. So, Dave got 26 tickets.
Response:  If Dave had 18 tickets and used 5 for players and 11 for clothes, then he must have had 2 (18 - 16) tickets left over.
Response:  If Dave has received 19 tickets and he used 12 for toys and 7 for clothes, then we can say that he has 19 - (12 + 7) = 19 - 19 = 0 tickets left. So, he has no more tickets left for either toys or clothes. Therefore, he used equal number of tickets for both toys and clothes.
Response:  We know that Dave has received 13 invitations and he gave away 8 of them to players. So, he used 5 invitations for players (8 / 13) = 0.42 (approximately). Therefore, Dave used approximately 0.42 times more invitations for oversized clothing than for players.
Response:  We know that Dave has 14 tickets and he lost 2 tickets. So, he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he bought 10 tickets for players, then he must have had at least 12 tickets before buying those 10. Therefore, Dave had 12 tickets initially.
Response:  We know that there were initially 14 trees planted in the garden and after Tajfun passed away, 9 of them survived. So, we have to find out how many trees died during the typhoon. To do this, we need to subtract the number of surviving trees from the initial total number of trees. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of trees that died = Initial total number of trees - Surviving trees = 14 - 9 = 5.
Response:  We know that 13 trees were planted and 6 of them died due to Tufan. So, the number of surviving trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, 7 trees have survived the typhoon out of the total 13 plantsed.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 20 trees in her backyard and after the storm only 4 of them remained standing. So, we can conclude that 16 trees (or 80%) have died as a result of the hurricane. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  If there were initially 12 trees and Haley planted some more, then she must have vaulted at least 6 trees (since 12 - 6 = 6). So, in total, Haley has grown 6 + 12 = 18 trees.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 9 trees initially and then added another 5 after Tafun's death. So, in total, she has 9 + 5 = 14 trees.
"Response:  If two trees were uprooted due to a typhoon at the Imperial Palace courtyard and initially there were 12 trees planted, then we can calculate how many trees were left based on the information provided in the question. Here is the calculation:

Initially, there were 12 trees planted at the Imperial Palace courtyard.
Two trees were uprooted due to a typhoon, leaving 10 trees remaining (12 - 2 = 10).
Therefore, there were 10 trees left after the typhoon hit the Imperial Palace courtyard."
Response:  If initially there were 3 trees that survived the typhoon and now 13 trees have died, then the total number of trees = Initially 3 + New deaths (13 - Surviving trees) = 3 + (-10) = 3 + (-10) = 7 trees. So, 7 trees have died in the typhoon.
Response:  If there were initially 11 trees and 2 survived the typhoon, then the number of trees that did not survive is equal to 11 - 2 = 9. So, 9 trees died in the typhoon.
Response:  If they are picking 66 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 28 oranges, then they are picking 66 x 28 = 1840 oranges per day.
"Response:  If there are currently 8 baskets of oranges and it takes x days to gather 24 baskets, then we can write an equation:

x = (24 - 8) / 8

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

Therefore, it will take 16 days to gather 24 baskets of oranges."
Response:  If it takes 4 days to harvest all the oranges, and there are 56 baskets per day, then we can calculate the total number of baskets that will be harvested in those 4 days as follows: Total baskets = Number of baskets per day x Number of days = 56 baskets/day x 4 days = 224 baskets. Therefore, there will be 224 baskets of oranges harvested over those 4 days.
"Response:  They collect 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 oranges. How many baskets of oranges will they have after 49 days of harvesting?  Therefore, the number of baskets of oranges they will have is:

$$ \text {Number of baskets} = \text {Total number of days} \times \text{Average number of baskets per day} $$

We know that there are $49$ days of harvesting, so we can calculate the total number of baskets as follows:

$$ \text {Total number of baskets} = 49 \times 38 = 1762 $$

Therefore, after $49$ days of harvesting, they will have $1762$ baskets of oranges."
Response:  They pick 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 oranges. So after 87 days of harvesting, they will have picked $\text{66 \* 25 = }$3900 oranges.
Response:  They collect eight baskets per day and each basket contains 35 oranges. So, they collect 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they pick 16 baskets per day and each basket contains 57 oranges, it will take 80 days to collect 80 baskets of oranges. Therefore, the answer is 80 days.
Response:  If they collect 67 jars of oranges every day and each jar contains 12 oranges, then they have collected a total of... (calculate)...oranges per day. Now, if they collect 35 jars of oranges, that means they have collected a total of... (calculate)...oranges.
Response:  They pick 74 baskets per day and throw away 71 baskets. How many baskets of grapes will they have after 51 days of harvesting?  Answer:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have 71 - 74 = -3 baskets less than they started with. So, they will have 74 x 51 = 3690 baskets of grapes left.
Response:  If they pick up 76 baskets per day and throw away 64 baskets, then they collect 12 baskets of oranges per day (76 - 64 = 12). Since each basket contains 50 oranges, they collect 12 x 50 = 600 oranges per day.
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, there will be 28 x 26 = 744 ripe pomegranates and 52 x 26 = 1320 unripe pomegranates. So, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have a total of 744 + 1320 = 2064 pomegranates.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 vreč zrelih pomaranč.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 31 x 45 = 1365 vreč of ripe tomatoes and 24 x 45 = 1080 vreč of unripened tomatoes. So, there will be 1365 - 1080 = 285 vreč of unripened tomatoes left after 45 days of harvesting.
Response:  On one day, they collected 44 baskets of ripe tomatoes and 25 baskets of unripe tomatoes. So, how many baskets of ripe tomatoes were gathered on that day?
Response:  On that day, they collected 5 baskets of ripe tomatoes and 74 baskets of unripe tomatoes. So, the number of baskets of unripened tomatoes gathered on that day is... (Do not forget to round your answer to the nearest whole number.)
Response:  If they collected 54 baskets of cherries in total and they collected 18 baskets per day, then it took them...  Days = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets per day = 54 / 18 = 3 days
Response:  If they collected 56 baskets of cherries in total and they picked for 14 days, then we can calculate how many baskets per day as follows:  Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days = 56 / 14 = 4 baskets per day
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 73 = 1825 unripe tomatoes and 5 x 73 = 365 ripe tomatoes. So, there will be 365 - 1825 = -1460 ripe tomatoes after 73 days of harvesting.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, he will have collected 6 x 6 = 36 vreč unharvested oranges. So, there will be 36 - 46 = -10 vreč fewer zrelih oranges after 6 days of harvesting. Therefore, the number of unharvested oranges after 6 days is 36.
Response:  On that day, they collected 41 baskets of immature oranges and 86 baskets of mature oranges. So, the number of baskets of mature oranges collected on that day is: 86 - 41 = 45 baskets.
Response:  On that day, they collected 71 baskets of immature oranges and 60 baskets of ripe oranges. So, the number of baskets of unripened oranges gathered on that day is... (Do you want to calculate it?)
Response:  So, we have to find out how much longer is the length of the room than its width. We know that the length of the room is 12 meters and its width is 11 meters. To find out how much longer it is, we can subtract the width from the length:  Length - Width = 12 - 11 = 1 meter. Therefore, the length of the room is 1 meter longer than its width.
Response:  We know that the length of the sofa is 2 meters and we need to cover it with a carpet that has an area of 14 square meters. To find out how wide the sofa is, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. So, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this formula, we get: Area = 2 m x Width  Therefore, the width of the sofa is equal to half of the area needed to cover it, which is 14/2 = 7 meters.
"Response:  The width of the room is given as $2$ meters. We need to find out how long the room is. Since the length of the room is equal to the area of the floor divided by the area of one square meter, we can write:
$$ \text{length} = \frac{\text{area of the floor}}{\text{area of one square meter}} $$
We are given that the area of the floor is $14$ square meters, and the area of one square meter is $1$ square meter. Therefore, we can plug in these values into the equation above to get:
$$ \text{length} = \frac{14}{1} = 14 \text{ meters} $$
So, the length of the room is $14$ meters."
Response:  The area of the floor is given as $A = 3 \text{ m} \times 5 \text{ m} = 15 \text{ square meters}$. Since we already have $16 \text{ square meters}$ of carpet covering part of the floor, we need to find out how much more carpet do we need to cover the remaining area. So, the total area that needs to be covered with carpet is: $$T = A - 16 = 15 - 16 = -1 \text{ square meter}$$So, we need $-1$ square meter of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that the length of the soba is 60 cm and its width is 40 cm. To find out how many pieces we need to cover the whole floor, we can divide the area of the floor (which is equal to the product of the length and width) by the area of each piece (which is equal to the square of the length). So, we have: Area of the floor = Length x Width = 60 x 40 = 2400 sq meters Area of each piece = Length x Width = 4 x 4 = 16 sq meters Therefore, we need 2400 / 16 = 150 pieces to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The length of each room is 6 meters and the width is also 6 meters. If there are 20 rooms, then the total area of all the rooms is: Area = Length x Width = 6 m x 6 m = 36 square meters. Since we want to cover the entire floor with carpeting, we need to calculate how much carpeting material we will need based on this area. To do this, we can use the following formula: Quantity of Carpeting Material Required = Total Area / Length of Carpeting Roll = 36 sqm / (Length of Carpeting Roll) =? Based on the information provided, if the length of one roll of carpeting is unknown, we cannot determine the exact amount of carpeting material needed for the entire floor without knowing that value. Therefore, I must ask for further clarification or additional information before providing an accurate answer.
"Response:  So, if the length of the room is 6 meters and its width is also 6 meters, then we can say that the length of the room is equal to its width (since it is a square). Therefore, the length of the room is 6 meters = 6 meters. Now, let's compare this value with the given information: ""Jessejeva soba je široka 6 metrov i dolga 6 metrov."" This means that the length of the room is equal to its width, which we have already established above. Therefore, the length of the room is not longer than its width. In fact, they are equal! So, the correct answer is: The length of the room is as long as its width."
Response:  We know that Jesse needs an area of 10 square meters to cover her room. Since she has a rectangular room with length equal to 1.5 meters and unknown width, we can calculate its area as follows: Area = Length x Width = 1.5 m x Width =? To find out how wide the room is, we need to divide the required area (10 square meters) by the length of the room (1.5 meters): Width = 10 / 1.5 = 6.67 meters So, Jesse's room is approximately 6.67 meters wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs an area of 10 square meters to cover her room. Since she wants to use a carpet with a length equal to its width, we can write: Area = Length x Width = 10 m^2 (since it is a rectangle) Now, we are given that the room is 2 meters wide, so the length must be twice as long: Length = 2 x 2 = 4 meters Therefore, Jesse's room is 4 meters long.
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square meters of carpet and his room is 4 meters long and 20 meters wide. To find out how much carpet he needs to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the length of the carpet. So, if we divide 18 square meters by 4 meters (the length of the room), we get 4.5 meters of carpet needed for the room. Since we can't have a fraction of a meter of carpet, let's round up to the nearest whole number which gives us 5 meters of carpet needed to cover the entire floor. Therefore, Jesse will need 5 meters of carpet to cover the entire floor of his room.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from t-shirts sold during the game was $230 and each t-shirt cost $23. So, we can calculate the number of t-shirts sold as follows: Number of t-shirts = Total revenue / Price per t-shirt = $230 / $23 = 10 majic. Therefore, they sold 10 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  If the shop earned $51 from selling 3 t-shirts during an Arkansas and Texas Tech game, then we can calculate how much each t-shirt sold for as follows:  Number of t-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per t-shirt = 51 / x = x = 17 (since there are 3 t-shirts) So, each t-shirt cost $17.
Response:  We know that they sold 95 t-shirts in total during both games in Arkansas and Texas. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, then we can find out how much money they earned from those sales as follows: Total amount of money earned = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt So, if they earned $87 for each t-shirt sold, then the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts in Arkansas would be: Total amount of money earned = 47 t-shirts x $87 per t-shirt = $3,999 Thus, the Razorback T-shirt trading company earned $3,999 from selling t-shirts during the game in Arkansas.
Response:  We know that they sold 106 t-shirts at one store and 242 t-shirts overall. So if they sold 115 t-shirts at another store, then the total number of t-shirts sold is: Total = Number of shirts sold at first store + Number of shirts sold at second store = 106 + 115 = 221 t-shirts. Therefore, they sold 221 t-shirts at the second store.
Response:  We know that they sold 163 t-shirts overall and 89 of them were from the game in Arkansas. So, we can calculate the revenue from the Arkansas game as follows: Revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 89 x $98 = $8,572 Now, we want to find out how much money they earned from the Arkansas game specifically. To do this, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game: Earnings from Arkansas game = Total revenue / Number of t-shirts sold in Arkansas = $8,572 / 89 = $96 Therefore, they earned $96 from each t-shirt sold during the game in Arkansas.
Response:  We know that they sold $78 per t-shirt and they sold 186 t-shirts during both games in Arkansas and Texas combined. So, their total revenue from t-shirt sales is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 186 x $78 = $14,320  Now, we are asked how much money they earned from t-shirt sales during the game in Texas alone. Since they sold 172 t-shirts during the Texas game, their revenue from t-shirt sales during the Texas game is:  Revenue (Texas) = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 172 x $78 = $13,056  Therefore, the difference between the revenue from t-shirt sales during the Texas game and the revenue from t-shirt sales during the game in Arkansas is:  Difference = Revenue (Texas) - Revenue (Arkansas) = $13,056 - $14,320 = -$1,264  So, they earned $1,264 less from t-shirt sales during the Texas game compared to the game in Arkansas.
Response:  We know that Razorback Shop earns $62 for each t-shirt and $99 for each jersey. So, if they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas, their total revenue from these sales would be:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price per jersey  Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99  Revenue = $11,543 + $2,799  Revenue = $14,342 Therefore, the Razorback Shop earned $14,342 from selling t-shirts and jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas.
Response:  We know that the shop earns $67 for each t-shirt and $165 for each jersey. So, if they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas, their total revenue from sales would be:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price per jersey  Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165  Revenue = $49,820 + $25,340  Revenue = $75,160 Therefore, the shop earned $75,160 from selling dresses during the game.
Response:  We know that razorback shop earned $192 from each t-shirt and $34 from each hat. So, total revenue from hats is 192 x 34 = $6,480. Similarly, total revenue from t-shirts is 157 x 34 = $5,282. Now we need to find out how much more money they made from selling t-shirts than hats. To do this, subtract the revenue from hats ($6,480) from the revenue from t-shirts ($5,282): $5,282 - $6,480 = -$1,200. Therefore, the price of a t-shirt is more than the price of a hat by $1,200.
Response:  We know that razorback shop earns $86 per t-shirt and $232 per jersey.  In total they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas. So we can calculate how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey as follows: T-Shirt Cost = Total Revenue / Number of T-Shirts Sold Jerseys Cost = Total Revenue / Number of Jerseys Sold Substituting the values given in the question, we get: T-Shirt Cost = $86 x 254 = $21,940 Jerseys Cost = $232 x 43 = $9,758 Now, let's find out how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey: Difference = Jerseys Cost - T-Shirt Cost Difference = $9,758 - $21,940 = $12,182 Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that each t-shirt costs approximately $12,182 more than a jersey.
Response:  The price of the razorback hoodie is $51. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they offered a discount of $8 on the hoodies and sold 130 hoodies. So, we can calculate their revenue as follows: Revenue = Number of hoodies sold x Price of each hoodie - Discount amount Revenue = 130 x $51 - $8 Revenue = $6,420 So, the Razorbacks earned $6,420 from selling those 130 hoodies during the game.
Response:  We know that the original price of the razorback hoodie was $201 dollars and during the game between Arkansas and Texas they increased the price to $217 dollars. They sold 14 hoodies. So we can calculate how much money they earned as follows: Total amount earned = Number of hoodies sold x Price increase per hoodie = 14 x ($217 - $201) = $958 Therefore, they earned $958 from selling those 14 hoodies.
Response:  We know that the trading post in Arkansas earned $60 from selling Razorback merchandise. If they earn $10 per sold t-shirt, then we can find out how many t-shirts were sold as follows: Number of t-shirts = Total amount earned / Earnings per t-shirt So, number of t-shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts Therefore, 6 t-shirts were sold at the trading post in Arkansas.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from sales is $215 and there are five shirts sold. So we can calculate the average price per shirt as follows: Average Price = Total Amount / Number of Shirts $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt Therefore, each shirt costs $43.
Response:  We know that the shop earns $5 for each t-shirt and $215 for each hoodie sold.  During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 hoodies. So, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 20 x $5 = $100 Revenue from hoodies = Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie = 64 x $215 = $13,760 Total revenue = Revenue from t-shirts + Revenue from hoodies = $100 + $13,760 = $13,860 Therefore, the shop earned $13,860 from selling majorettes during the game.
Response:  We know that razorback shop earns $76 from each t-shirt and $204 from each hoodie. So, if they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas, their total revenue would be:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie  Revenue = 158 x $76 + 2 x $204  Revenue = $13,944  Therefore, the Razorback Shop earned $13,944 from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game.
Response:  We know that the razorback shop earns $210 from each shirt and $240 from each jacket. So, if they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jackets during the game between Arkansas and Texas, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt + Number of Jackets x Price per Jacket In this case, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 177 x $210 + 23 x $240 = $56,980 Now, to find out how much more money the razorback shop earned from selling t-shirts than jackets, we need to subtract the amount earned from selling jackets from the total revenue: Difference = Total Revenue - Amount Earned from Selling Jackets = $56,980 - ($240 x 23) = $56,980 - $5,320 = $51,660 Therefore, the razorback shop earned $51,660 more from selling t-shirts than it did from selling jackets.
Response:  We know that the shop earns $115 for each shirt and $25 for each jacket.  The total number of jackets sold is 78, and the total number of shirts sold is 113. So, we can calculate the revenue from jackets as follows: Revenue from jackets = Number of jackets x Price per jacket = 78 x $25 = $1900 Now, let's calculate the revenue from shirts: Revenue from shirts = Number of shirts x Price per shirt = 113 x $115 = $13025 Therefore, more money is earned from selling shirts than jackets.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 more chairs than tables, then...
Response:  If there are 12 seats in total and they want to divide them equally among two tables with equal number of seats, then each table will have 6 seats.
Response:  If they have three stools and there are 9 stools in total, then each person has 3/9 = 1/3 of a stool. So, there is one stool for every three people.
"Response:  If they have 11 pairs of tables and each pair has 13 chairs, then we can calculate how many chairs are available for the party as follows:

Number of chairs = Number of pairs of tables x Number of chairs per pair
= 11 x 13
= 133 chairs
Therefore, there will be 133 chairs available for the party at the venue."
Response:  If there are 10 pairs of chairs and each pair has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  And if 11 people sit on the chairs, then 50 chairs will be left empty (60 - 11).
Response:  We know that there are 12 pairs of tables and each pair has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Additionally, we have 6 extra chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and they have 4 sets of tables with 3 chairs each, then we need to calculate how many chairs will be needed for all the guests. So, the number of chairs needed is: 14 x 3 = 42 chairs.
Response:  If they have 14 stools for each of the 9 pairs of tables (a total of 9 x 2 = 18 tables), then we can calculate the number of stools as follows: Number of stools = Total number of tables x Number of stools per table = 18 x 14 = 252 stools. Therefore, there are more than 9 pairs of tables with more than 14 stools.
Response:  If Če Lewis earns $460 in five weeks, he will earn $92 per week. So, he will earn $18 per day ($92 / 5 days). Therefore, Če Lewis earns $18 per day.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1216 during harvest and he earns $16 per day, then we can calculate how many days it took for him to earn that amount as follows:

$1216 = $16 x (number of days)

Now, we need to solve for the number of days. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $16:

$16 / $16 = (number of days)

So, the number of days it took Lewis to earn $1216 is:

Number of days = 78 days

Therefore, Lewis worked for 78 days during the harvest season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per day for 216 days of work and has to pay $702 in taxes, he will have $993 left after paying the taxes. So at the end of the year, he will have $993 + $21 \* 52 = $1,483.
"Response:  If he works for 223 days in a year and earns $1357 per day, then his total income for one year is:

$1357 x 223 = $294,011

Now, if he works for 73 years, his total income will be:

$294,011 x 73 = $20,687,333

So, Če Lewis will earn approximately $20,687,333 over 73 years of working as a farmer."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $28 per day in 1091 days of harvesting. Then he also earns $939 per week for overtime work. If he works more than an hour extra each day, how much money does he make during the harvesting period? So, let's calculate it as follows: Total daily income = Daily wage x Number of working days = $28 x 1091 = $27,640 Total overtime income = Overtime wage x Number of overtime hours = $939 x (Number of overtime days / 5) = $939 x (1091 / 5) = $187,800 Now, let's find out how many hours Lewis works beyond his regular time: Extra hours worked = Total overtime income / Overtime wage = $187,800 / $939 = 200 hours Therefore, Lewis makes an additional $200 per day during the harvesting period due to overtime work.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis earns per week. Since he works for 233 days, his weekly income is: $403 x 233 = $91,570. Now, we need to subtract the rent he pays each week: $91,570 - $49 = $87,560. So, in total, Lewis earns $87,560 during the harvesting period.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks (which is approximately equal to 20 years), then he will have earned a total of:

$368/week x 1359 weeks = $479,420

Now, if he has to pay $388 per week as rent, then he will have paid a total of:

$388/week x 1359 weeks = $527,610

So, Lewis pays $527,610 in rent during the 20-year period."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 days (or 3 years), then he will have earned a total of:

$491 x 1181 = $570,911

Now, if he has to pay $216 rent every week, he will have paid a total of:

$216 x 1181 = $247,916

So, at the end of the lease period, Lewis will have $570,911 - $247,916 = $323,005 left in his bank account."
Response:  If Lewis earned $133 in 19 days of harvesting, then he earned an average of $7 per day. So, he earns $7/day.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per day during harvesting and he earned $178 in total, then we can calculate how many days he worked as follows:

$178 = $2 x Number of days
Number of days = $178 / $2
Number of days = 89 days (round up to nearest whole number)"
"Response:  If the depth of water is 10 times greater than Dean's height and he stands at an angle of 9 degrees above the horizontal, we can calculate how deep the water is from his position.  We know that sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse, where θ is the angle between Dean and the horizon, h is Dean's height, and o is the distance to the horizon.  Substituting these values, we get:

sin(θ) = 9 / (10 \* x)

where x is the depth of the water. Solving for x, we find that the water is approximately 9.5 meters deeper than Dean's height."
Response:  We know that the depth of water is twice as great as Dean's height. So if Dean's height is x meters, then the depth of water is 2x meters. Since Ron is shorter than Dean, we can say that Ron's height is less than or equal to x meters. Therefore, the depth of water must be greater than or equal to 2x meters. Now we are given that the depth of water is greater than Dean's height, so we can conclude that the depth of water is at least 2x meters. However, since Ron is shorter than Dean, his height cannot exceed half of the total depth of water (since he is not taller than Dean). Therefore, the depth of water must be at least 3x meters (since it is greater than Dean's height and less than or equal to 4 times Dean's height).
Response:  We know that at the beginning of their dive, the depth of water was five times greater than Ron's height. So if Ron is 5 meters tall (which we can assume without loss of generality), then the depth of water would be 5 x 5 = 25 meters. Since Dean is smaller than Ron, he will also be less than half of this value. Therefore, the depth of water is at least 25 - (0.5 x 25) = 18.75 meters.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the dive, the water depth was 15 times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean is 1.8 meters tall (or 180 cm), then the water depth must be 2700 cm = 2.7 meters (or 270 cm). Since Ron is 1.8 meters tall as well, and he is standing at an angle of 13 degrees above the horizontal, we can calculate his distance from the surface using trigonometry. Specifically, we need to use the sine function to find the length of Ron's shadow, which will give us his distance from the surface. Using the given values, we get: Shadow length = sin(13°) x height of Ron = sin(13°) x 1.8 m = 1.46 m If Ron is 1.46 meters away from the surface, and the water depth is 2.7 meters, then the angle between Ron's line of sight and the horizon must be equal to the angle between the horizon and the center of the Earth. This gives us: tan(θ) = tan(R) tan(θ) = 27 / 2πr Where r is the radius of the Earth, which is approximately 6371 km. Solving for θ, we get: θ = arctan(27/2πr) = arctan(27/2 × 6371) = 13.4° Therefore, Ron is 13.4 degrees above the horizontal, and the water depth is 2.7 meters.
"Response:  We know that the depth of water is 16 times greater than Ron's height. So if Ron is 9 meters tall (which we assume to be his actual height), then the depth of the water would be:

Depth = 16 x Height of Ron
= 16 x 9
= 144 meters
Therefore, the depth of the water was 144 meters."
"Response:  We know that the depth of water is nine times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean is 15 meters tall (which we assume to be his actual height), then the depth of the water must be:

Depth = 9 x Height of Dean
= 9 x 15 m
= 135 m

Therefore, the depth of the water was 135 meters."
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to arrange them evenly on two shelves, each shelf will have 17 books (half of 34).
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each book contains two pages (or knjig), then he has 84 pages in total (42 x 2 = 84).
Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each book is divided into 23 police (or parts), then he has 27 x 23 = 619 parts of books. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines for each part of his books, then he has 619 x 80 = 49,720 magazines in total. Therefore, Brian has 49,720 magazines in total.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book is accompanied by 10 police officers (i.e., 1 book per officer), then he has 9 x 10 = 90 police officers. Similarly, if each officer reads 46 magazines, then Brian has 90 x 46 = 4240 magazines in total. Therefore, Brian has 4240 magazines in total.
"Response:  If Brian has 23 books and each book is accompanied by 61 magazines, then he has a total of:

$ Number of books = 23 $
$ Number of magazines per book = 61 $
$ Total number of magazines = $ 23 \times 61 = 1353 $

So, Brian has 1353 magazines in total."
Response:  If Brian has looked at 7 books and he has 28 books in total, then each book is on one of his shelves (polic). So, if we divide the number of books (28) by the number of shelves (7), we get the number of books that are on each shelf: 28 / 7 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 books on each shelf or polic.
Response:  If each book contains two books, then there are altogether 76 books (38 x 2 = 76). So, if Brian has looked at all of them, he must have 76 police officers.
"Response:  If Carol sends invitations to 10 friends for her birthday party and each friend receives two invitations (as stated in the problem), then the total number of invitations sent is:

2 x 10 = 20 invitations

Therefore, Carol needs at least 20 invitations to ensure that no one is left out."
"Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 12 friends and bought three packages of identical numbers (let's call them A, B, C), then we can calculate as follows:

Number of invitations per package = Number of friends / Number of packages
= 12 / 3
= 4

So each package contains 4 invitations."
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to her friends for her birthday party and each package contained 10 invitations, then she bought 7 packages of invitations. So, if she sends invitations only to two friends, there will be 2 x 10 = 20 invitations left over after sending them all.
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations for her birthday party to her friends and received 6 back, that means she had 6 / 14 = 0.429 (or approximately 43%) of her invited guests responded. Then, if she bought additional 11 invitations, it means she has now sent out a total of 6 + 11 = 17 invitations. So, the number of friends she can invite is 17 x 14 = 238. Therefore, the answer is 238.
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations for her birthday party to her friends with each package containing 3 invitations and she bought 2 packages, then: Number of invitations = Total number of invitations / Number of packages = 3 x 9 = 27 invitations. So, Carol will need to buy additional 2 packages (or 6 more invitations) to reach her target of 9 friends. Therefore, the correct answer is 2.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played x games, then her total score would be 12x. Since she scored 36 points altogether, we can set up an equation as follows: 12x = 36. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 81 points in three games and she scored the same number of points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information:  Points = Game 1 + Game 2 + Game 3  Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:  Points = 81 + 81 + 81  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Points = 243 So, Melissa scored 243 points in total across all three games.
Response:  We know that Melissa has scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points in each game. So, her total score for one game is 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, we need to find out how many games she played. According to the question, Melissa played 79 games. Therefore, her total score is 191 x 79 = 14,539 points.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in some games and received 7 points for each game, then we can write an equation as follows: Points = Number of Games x Points per Game So, if Melissa played n games, her total score would be: Total Score = Number of Games x Points per Game = n x 7 = 7n Now, we are given that Melissa played x games. Therefore, her total score is: Total Score = 7x To find out how many games Melissa played, we need to divide her total score by her average score per game: Number of Games = Total Score / Points per Game = 7x / 7 = x So, Melissa played x games.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and she scored the same number of points (91) in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: Points = Total points / Number of games So if we substitute the values given in the problem into this equation, we get: Points = 91 / 13 Which simplifies to: Points = 7 PTS QUESTION 2: In which year was the company founded?

Answer: The correct answer is (C) 1805. According to the passage, the company was founded ""in the early years of the nineteenth century,"" specifically ""in 1805."" Therefore, the answer is (C) 1805."
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride at the same time, then we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many people each seat can accommodate. So, the answer is 5 (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If there are some seats in space and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then we need to know how many seats are available for calculation.  Therefore, if 18 people can ride a bike at once, it means that one bike can carry 18/9 = 2 seats (since each person takes up one seat). So, there must be 2 x 9 = 18 seats in the helicopter.
"Response:  If there are 19 seats in the helicopter and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the helicopter is:

19 seats x 15 passengers per seat = 285 passengers
Now, we need to find out how many people can fit in the helicopter at once. To do this, we divide the total capacity of the helicopter (285 passengers) by the number of seats available for passengers (19):

285 passengers / 19 seats = 15 passengers per flight
Therefore, the helicopter can carry 15 passengers at a time."
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then we have X number of available seats = 18 - 10 = 8. So, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is equal to the number of available seats divided by the capacity of one seat, which is 8 / 15 = 2.67. Therefore, the answer is 2-3 people.
Response:  If there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel and it can hold up to 6 seats with each seat holding 14 people, then we need to find out how many seats are available for more people to ride. Therefore, the number of additional people who can come is equal to the number of available seats on the Ferris wheel minus the number of people already on it. In this case, if the Ferris wheel has 6 seats and each seat holds 14 people, then there are 6 x 14 = 84 available seats. So, the maximum number of people who can come is 84 - 16 = 68.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the Ferris wheel at Rajski Park. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, and each large seat can accommodate 54 people. So, if we want to calculate how many people can fit on the small seats, we need to divide the total number of seats by the number of small seats. In this case, we have: Total number of seats = 2 + 23 = 25 Seats available for small seats = 2 x 14 = 28 People who can fit on small seats = 28 / 14 = 2 people per small seat Therefore, two people can fit on each small seat.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, and each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, we have to find out how many people can fit on all the seats together. The total number of people who can fit on all the seats is equal to the sum of the number of people who can fit on each small seat plus the number of people who can fit on each large seat. Therefore, the total number of people who can fit on all the seats is:  Small seats: 3 x 16 = 48 Large seats: 7 x 12 = 84 Total number of people who can fit on all the seats: 48 + 84 = 132 People.
Response:  If 16 people can fit in a helicopter at Disneyland Park simultaneously, and each seat has space for one person, then we need to divide 16 by 4 (the number of seats) to find out how many people can sit in each seat. So, there are 4 people per seat.
"Response:  If we have 4 people in the park and each seat on the helicopter can hold 2 people, then...

A) The helicopter has 8 seats.
B) The helicopter has 16 seats.
C) The helicopter has 20 seats.
D) The helicopter has 32 seats.
E) The helicopter has 40 seats.
Please choose your answer from the options above (A-E)."
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of slices (recesses), then the total number of recesses is 7 x = 28. Since there are 14 recesses in total, the number of recesses per pizza is 28 / 7 = 4.
Response:  If each person has two scissors and there are 28 people in total, then we have:  Number of pairs of scissors = Total number of people x Number of pairs per person  Number of pairs of scissors = 28 x 2 = 56 scissors. Therefore, we have naročili (bought) 56 pairs of scissors.
"Response:  If we have 17 pieces of cake and each piece has 4 slices, then... See full solution

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If we have 17 pieces of cake and each piece has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is:

17 x 4 = 68

So, there are 68 slices of cake in total."
"Response:  If we have 9 pieces of pizza and each piece has 10 slices, then... See full solution
23. Question: A company produces two types of pens - blue and red. The blue pens are produced at a rate of 5 per minute, while the red pens are produced at a rate of 8 per minute. How many pens does the company produce in 4 minutes?   Based on the information provided, formulate a numerical answer to this question.  Answer: To find out how many pens the company produces in 4 minutes, we need to multiply the production rates for each type of pen. So, if the blue pens are produced at a rate of 5 per minute, then the number of blue pens produced in 4 minutes is: 5 x 4 = 20 blue pens. Similarly, if the red pens are produced at a rate of 8 per minute, then the number of red pens produced in 4 minutes is: 8 x 4 = 32 red pens. Therefore, the total number of pens produced by the company in 4 minutes is: 20 + 32 = 52 pens."
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mom plant roses and together they planted some seeds.  In each flower bed, they gave 10 seeds. So, if there are 45 flower beds, then the total number of seeds given is:  Number of seeds = Total number of flower beds x Number of seeds per flower bed  Number of seeds = 45 x 10  Number of seeds = 450 seeds  Therefore, they have planted 450 seeds.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mom plant roses and together they planted 45 seeds in 9 flower beds. If they gave equal number of seeds to each flower bed, then we can say that the number of seeds given to each flower bed is 45/9 = 5 seeds per flower bed. So, the number of seeds planted in each flower bed is 5 seeds.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mom plant roses and together they planted 36 seeds. Since only 58 of them germinated into flowers, we can conclude that there were initially 36 + (58 - 58) = 36 + 0 = 36 seedlings per row. So, there were 36 rows of flowers.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mom plant roses and together they planted 55 seeds. Since each seed packet contains 15 seeds, we can calculate how many packets of seeds were used as follows: Number of packets = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per packet = 55 / 15 = 3 packets So, three packets of seeds were used to plant all the roses. Now, let's find out how many flowers grew from these seeds: Number of flowers = Number of packets x Number of seeds per flower = 3 x 60 = 180 flowers Therefore, 180 flowers grew from the 55 seeds that Paige and her mom planted.
Response:  If Paige helped her mom plant roses and each flowerbed has 10 seeds per seedling, then they have planted 60 seeds (3 x 20 = 60). So, if they have planted 60 seeds, there must be 60 flower beds.
Response:  If Paige helped her mom plant roses in 8 flower beds and they sowed 32 seeds per bed, then we can calculate how many seeds were sown as follows: Number of seeds = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds So, if they sowed 32 seeds per bed and there are 8 flower beds, then the total number of seeds is: 32 x 8 = 256 seeds Therefore, Paige and her mom sowed 256 seeds altogether.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 creamers, then he gave away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 creamers. So, Matthew had 22 - 22 = 0 creamers left for himself.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 friends and gave each friend 2 crows as a gift, then he gave a total of 16 crows (2 x 8 = 16). So, he gave crow to 16 friends.
"Response:  If Matthew had 15 kri...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If Matthew had 15 krikerjev and gave 5 of them to his friends, then he has 15 - 5 = 10 left.  Since there are still 10 krikerjev left after Matthew gave some away, each of his 5 friends must have received 2 krikerji (since there were originally 10 krikerjev and now there are only 5 left)."
Response:  Firstly, Matthew gave 8 creakers to his three friends, so he had 24 - 8 = 16 creakers left. Then, he gave 5 creakers to each of his two remaining friends, so he had 16 - (5 x 2) = 10 creakers left. Finally, he gave 3 creakers to one friend and none to the other two, so he had 10 - 3 = 7 creakers left. Therefore, Matthew had 7 creakers left after giving some away.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 crackers and gave an equal number to each of his 11 friends, then he would have given away 22 / 11 = 2 crackers per friend. Therefore, each friend received 2 crackers from Matthew.
Response:  If Matthew has 29 creamers and 30 tarts, that means he has a total of 59 sweets (29 + 30).  If he wants to share them equally among his friends, each friend will get 59/x sweets, where x is the number of friends. Since there are 4 friends, each friend will get 14.75 sweets (59/4 = 14.75). So, each friend will eat 14 torte.
"Response:  If Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 tarts, and he gave equal amounts to his 7 friends, then each friend received:

Number of crackers = Total number of crackers / Number of friends
= 14 / 7
= 2

So each friend got 2 crackers.

Now, let's find out how many tarts each friend got:

Number of tarts = Total number of tarts / Number of friends
= 21 / 7
= 3

So each friend got 3 tarts."
Response:  If Matthew had equal number of cookies for all his 18 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of cookies. So, if he gave 36 cookies in total, then each friend got 36/18 = 2 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew had 36 creamers and gave each of his six friends 6 creamers, then he would have given away a total of 6 x 36 = 216 creamers. Therefore, he gave away 216 creamers to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 knives and gave an equal number to his friends, then each friend received 23/x knives, where x is the total number of friends. Since there are 11 remaining friends after giving them all an equal amount of knives, we can write the equation: 23/x = 11. Solving for x, we get: x = 23 / 11 = 2. So each friend received 2 knives from Matthew.
Response:  If Matthew had 31 crackers and gave 23 to his friends, then he has 31 - 23 = 8 remaining crackers. So, he gave 5 friends 8/5 = 1.6 creakers each. Therefore, Matthew gave 1 + 1.6 + 1.6 + 1.6 + 1.6 = 7 creakers to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 32 creamers and shared them equally among his four friends, each friend would get 8 creamers (32 / 4 = 8). Now, if he also had 98 cookies and shared them equally among his four friends, each friend would get 24 cookies (98 / 4 = 24). So, each friend got 8 creamers and 24 cookies in total.
Response:  If Matthew had 10 cream puffs and shared them equally among his four friends, each friend would get 2.5 cream puffs (10 / 4 = 2.5). However, if he also had 8 cakes and shared them equally among his friends, each friend would get 2 cakes (8 / 4 = 2). So, each friend got a total of 4.5 treats (2.5 + 2 = 4.5) from Matthew.
"Response:  If Matthew had 28 friends and he gave each of them an equal number of cream puffs and éclairs, then...

Let X be the total number of cream puffs Matthew gave away (X = 28). Since each friend received an equal number of cream puffs and éclairs, we can write:

X + 13 = 28... (1)
X + 15 = 28... (2)

Now, let's solve for X in equation (1):

X = 28 - 13
X = 15

So, Matthew gave away 15 cream puffs to his friends.

Next, let's solve for X in equation (2):

X = 28 - 15
X = 13

So, Matthew gave away 13 éclairs to his friends.

Therefore, the answer is:
Matthew gave away 15 cream puffs and 13 éclairs to his 28 friends."
Response:  We know that in one day she drank 109 glasses of water and we are told that each glass takes 74 days to empty. So if she emptied 109 glasses in one day, then she must have had how many glasses in total?  To find out, divide the number of glasses she emptied in one day (109) by the time it took her to empty one glass (74 days): 109 / 74 = 15 Therefore, she must have bought 15 steklenic vode.
"Response:  If she bought 153 bottles of water at a discount and drank the same number every day, then we can calculate how many days it lasted her as follows:

Days = Total amount / Daily consumption
= 153 / 17
= 9 days
So, she drank 9 days worth of water."
"Response:  If she bought 264 bottles of water and consumed 15 per day for 11 days, then we can calculate how many bottles are left as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles purchased x Number of days used
= 264 x 11
= 2910

So, there are 2910 bottles left."
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 bottles of water at a discount price and consumed 144 bottles per day for several days. To find out how many days she consumed them, we can use the following equation: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption  In this case, the total number of bottles is 301 (Debbie bought), and the daily consumption is 144 (Debbie consumed). So, to solve for the number of days, we can plug these values into the equation: Number of days = 301 / 144 = 2  Therefore, Debbie consumed the water for 2 days.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda, then she has a total of 101 drinks (88 + 13 = 101).  If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, it means that her supply of drinks will last for:

Days = Total number of drinks / Number of drinks per day
= 101 / 94 (since she drinks 4 bottles of water per day)
= 10.6 days
Therefore, Debbie's supply of drinks will last for approximately 10.6 days."
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of juice, then she has a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  If she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of juice per day, it means that she will finish all her bottles in 312/4 = 78 days. So, the number of days that the bottles will last is 78 days.
Response:  If Debbie drinks six glasses of water per day and buys 12 glasses of water, it means she has 6 + 12 = 18 glasses of water in total. Since she drinks one glass at a time, she will run out of water in 18 / 6 = 3 days. Therefore, the answer is 3 days.
"Response:  If Debbie has bought 95 glasses of water and 180 glasses of juice, then she has a total of 275 glasses (95 + 180).  If she drinks 15 glasses of water and 54 glasses of juice per day, it means that her supply will last for:

Total number of days = Total number of glasses / Daily consumption
= 275 / 79
= 3.5 days
Therefore, Debbie's supply of glasses will last for approximately 3.5 days."
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 glasses of water and 162 glasses of juice, then she has a total of 522 glasses (360 + 162).  If she drinks 122 glasses of water and 9 glasses of juice per day, it means that she will finish all her drinks in 4 days (122 / 30 = 4 days). So, the number of days that the glasses can last is 4 days.
"Response:  If Faye has divided swingers into 14 types with 11 swingets in each type, then we have:
Number of types = 14
Number of swingets per type = 11
Total number of swingets = Number of types x Number of swingets per type
= 14 x 11
= 154
So, there are 154 swingets in total."
Response:  If Faye has posted 12 swings in total and she divided them into three types, then we can assume that each type contains a fraction of the total number of swings. We know that there are 12 swings in total, so if we divide it equally among three types, each type will have 4 swings (12 / 3 = 4). Therefore, Faye has posted 4 swings in each of the three types.
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 swan neck reflectors and each of them contains 24 swan neck reflectors. So, in total she has 28 x 24 = 672 swan neck reflectors. Since we are asked how many rows can she make with these, we need to divide the number of swan neck reflectors by the number of reflectors per row, which is 16 (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the number of rows Faye can make is 672 / 16 = 43 rows.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 22 swingers in each row and she had 6 swinging machines with 14 swings per machine. So, we can calculate the total number of swings as follows: Total number of swings = Number of rows x Number of swings per row + Number of machines x Number of swings per machine Total number of swings = 22 x 6 + 14 x 6 = 1320 swings Now, we need to find out how many swinger there are in total. To do this, we divide the total number of swings by the number of swings per machine: Total number of swingers = Total number of swings / Number of swings per machine Total number of swingers = 1320 / 14 = 93 swingers Therefore, Faye has 93 swingers in total.
Response:  If we have 35 swingers and 7 colorful ones, each row will contain how many swingers?  We can divide 35 by 7 to get the number of rows needed: 35 / 7 = 5. So, there will be 5 rows with 7 swingers in each row.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 19 swingers and colorful swingers in different categories with 4 swingers and 27 swinging toys in each category. So, we need to find out how many swingers are there altogether. To do this, we can multiply the number of categories (19) by the total number of swingers in each category (4 + 27 = 31). Therefore, the total number of swingers is 19 x 31 = 569.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 7 types of switches, with each type having 36 switches and 30 switch lights in each type. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of bar switches as follows: Total number of bar switches = Number of types x Number of switches per type x Number of light bulbs per switch = 7 x 36 x 30 = 12940 bar switches So, there are 12940 bar color switches in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has posted 11 different types of pencils and pens with 31 pencils and 27 pens in each type. Therefore, we have:

Pencils: 31 x 11 = 341 pencils
Pens: 27 x 11 = 307 pens
Total number of pencils and pens: 341 + 307 = 648
Therefore, there are 648 swinckers and barrels in total."
Response:  If Faye has placed 30 swingers in a row with five swings each, then she will have placed 30 x 5 = 150 swings altogether. Since there are 30 swingers in total, each swinger must be placed in 150/30 = 5 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 5 rows of swingers.
Response:  If she has 6 swingers and wants to divide them into two groups of equal size, then we can assume that each group will have 3 swingers. Therefore, Faye must have posted 3 + 3 = 6 swingers in total.
Response:  We know that Faye had 35 swan neck pendulums and each pendulum has 4 swinging pendulums. So, in total, she had 35 x 4 = 140 swinging pendulums. Since she wanted to arrange them in rows with two pendulums in each row, we can divide the total number of pendulums by 2 to get the number of rows: 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Faye could have arranged her pendulums into 70 rows.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 swan neck pendulums and each of them has 6 swinging pendulums. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 swinging pendulums.
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed 30 different types of sticks and each type contains 71 sticks. Therefore, the total number of sticks is:

30 x 71 = 2130

Now, we also know that each type of stick contains 24 swatches. So, the total number of swatches is:

2130 x 24 = 50960

Therefore, there are 50960 swatches in total."
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed 16 swingers and 6 colorful swingers in each of the 8 categories. Therefore, we have:

Total number of swingers = Number of categories x Number of swingers per category
= 8 x 6 + 8 x 21
= 48 + 176
= 224

So, there are 224 barn swingers in total."
Response:  We know that there are 7 school buses and 98 students. Since each bus can seat at most 50 passengers (according to the given information), we have: Number of seats on all buses = Total number of students x Seating capacity per bus = 98 students x 50 passengers/bus = 4900 seats So, there are 4900 seats in total across all 7 school buses.
"Response:  We know that:

* The school has 84 classrooms.
* 95 school buses are full (i.e., all seats are occupied).
* Each bus has 118 seats.

Now we can calculate the number of students in the school as follows:

Number of students = Number of buses x Number of seats per bus / Number of classrooms
= 95 x 118 / 84
= 760

Therefore, there are approximately 760 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 students in total and they are divided into 6 classes with 10 students each (since we have 66 students per class). Therefore, we need to transport 67 / 6 = 11 students per bus. Since each bus has 6 seats, we need 11 / 6 = 1.83 buses for all students to go on an outing. So, approximately 2 buses are needed.
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students in total. Since each class has an equal number of students, we can assume that each bus will carry an equal number of students as well. Therefore, if we have x buses, then the number of students per bus is 58/x.
Now, since there are 2 seats in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students (58) by the number of seats per bus (2): 58 / 2 = x buses. So, we need 29 buses for the field trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 120 students in total and they are divided into different classes with an equal number of students in each class. So, we can assume that there are 120/x students in each class, where x is the number of classes. Since there are 24 classes in total, we have:

120 = 24x

Now, we know that each school bus has 84 seats, so we can calculate the number of students who go on the field trip as follows:

Number of students going on the field trip = Number of students in each class x Number of classes going on the field trip
= (120/x) x (number of classes going on the field trip)

Since there are 24 classes going on the field trip, we have:

Number of students going on the field trip = (120/x) x 24
= 3040

So, there are approximately 3040 students going on the field trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms and 102 students in total. If 22 students do not go on the field trip, then we need to subtract them from the total number of students. So, the remaining number of students who will go on the field trip is:

102 - 22 = 80

Since each school bus can accommodate 8 seats, we need:

80 / 8 = 10 buses

Therefore, we need 10 school buses for the field trip."
"Response:  If there are 102 students and 11 students do not go on the field trip, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is:

$$ \boxed{102 - 11 = 91} $$

So, there will be 91 students going on the field trip."
Response:  If there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has three seats in the bus, we need 3 x 72 = 216 seats in total for all the classes to go on an outing. Since there are 111 students in the school, we have 216 - 111 = 105 extra seats available in the buses. So, we need 5 buses to take all the students on an outing.
Response:  If there are 46 school buses surrounding the school and together they carry 92 students, then each bus can carry at most 2 students (since there are more than twice as many buses as students). Therefore, there must be at least 46 seats per bus (since each bus has to accommodate at least 2 students). So, there are 46 seats in each of the 46 school buses.
Response:  If Haley has 9 chocolates and she gives one to each of the 11 boys in her class, then she will have left with 9 - 11 = -2 chocolates. So, Haley had initially 9 chocolates.
Response:  If there are n boys and each boy gets 5 marbles from Haley, then Haley has given away a total of 5n marbles. Since Haley had 10 marbles to begin with, this means that she now has 10 - 5n marbles left. So, the number of boys is n = 10 / (10 - 5n). Solving for n, we get n = 2. Therefore, Haley gave marbles to 2 boys.
Response:  If there are 4 boys and each boy gets an equal share of candies (not necessarily 15), then the number of candies each boy will get is: Number of boys = 4 Candies per boy = Total number of candies / Number of boys = 23 / 4 = 5.75 So, each boy will get approximately 6 candies.
Response:  We know that 13 boys love playing marbles and 50 boys love playing cards. If Haley has 26 marbles, how many will each boy get if they are divided equally among them? To find out, we can divide 26 by 13: 26 / 13 = 2 So each of the 13 boys will get 2 marbles from Haley. Now let's consider the card game. Since there are 50 boys who love playing cards, if they are divided equally among them, each boy will get 50/50 = 1 card. Therefore, each of the 50 boys will get 1 card from Haley.
Response:  If Haley has 20 balls and there are 4 boys in her class who play soccer, then each boy will get 5 balls (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If Haley gave each boy two marbles and there were 28 boys in total, then she gave away a total of 2 x 28 = 56 marbles. So, the correct answer is 56.
Response:  If Frank read his favorite book for x days and it had y pages, then we can write an equation as follows:  x = (y / 14) days  Now, we are given that the book has 392 pages, so we can plug this value into our equation:  x = (392 / 14) days  Simplifying, we get:  x = 27 days  Therefore, Frank took 27 days to read his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. So, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day Total pages = 569 x 22 = 12380 pages Therefore, the book has 12380 pages.
"Response:  If Frank took six days to read his favorite book and each day he read an equal number of pages (24 chapters), then we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
= 612 pages / 6 days
= 102 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank took his favorite book and it had 555 pages. Since each chapter has an equal number of pages (not necessarily a multiple of 5), we can assume that there are 5 chapters in total. Therefore, each chapter has 111 pages (555 / 5 = 111). So, to find out how many pages each chapter contains, we divide the number of pages by the number of chapters: 111 pages per chapter.
Response:  We know that Frank took his favorite book and it had 193 pages. Also, we are told that the book was equally divided into 15 chapters. Therefore, each chapter has 12.87 pages (193/15). Now, we need to find out how many days Frank spent reading each chapter. According to the problem, Frank took 660 days to finish the entire book. So, he read one chapter every 660/15 = 44 days. Since there are 15 chapters in total, Frank read one chapter per 44 days.
Response:  If Frank took 3 days to read all the books and each book had 249 pages, then he must have read at most 249 pages per day. So, if he read 8 books in total, he must have read 1961 pages (8 x 249) in total.
Response:  If Frank took 12 days to read each book and he read 6 books, then it will take him 72 days (12 x 6 = 72) to read all the books. So, if it takes him 492 days to read all the books, that means he has read 492 / 72 = 6.8 books per month. Therefore, Frank reads approximately 6.8 books per month.
"Response:  If Frank took his favorite book for 16 days and he read it for 8 hours per day, then we can calculate how many pages he read in one hour as follows:

Time taken = 16 days x 8 hours/day = 128 hours
Pages read per hour = Total pages / Time taken
= 112 pages / 128 hours
= 0.87 pages/hour
So, Frank read approximately 0.87 pages per hour."
Response:  If Frank read his favorite book for x days and each day he read 8 pages, then we can write an equation as follows:  x = (number of pages / number of days) * 8  In this case, the number of pages is given as 576, so let's substitute it into the equation:  x = (576 / x) \* 8  Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?
"Response:  If Frank has finished reading his favorite book in 30 days and each chapter has 450 pages, then he must have read:

Total number of chapters = Number of days x Number of chapters per day
= 30 x 41
= 1230 chapters

So, Frank has read 1230 chapters in 30 days."
"Response:  If Frank took 607 days to read his favorite book and each chapter has 594 pages, then we can calculate how many pages are in each chapter as follows:

Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of pages per chapter
= 3 x 594 = 1782 pages

So, there are 1782 pages in each chapter."
Response:  If Frank took 664 days to read his favorite book and each chapter has 405 pages, then he must have read two chapters per day. So, in one day, Frank reads 2 x 405 = 810 pages. Therefore, Frank reads 810 pages per day.
"Response:  If we have 6 DVD-jevs that cost $120 in total, then each DVD-jev costs:
$120 / 6 = $20 per DVD-jev."
Response:  If $81 is equal to 33 DVDs at $2.50 each, then we can calculate as follows:  $81 / $2.50 = 33 DVDs So, there are 33 DVDs for $81.
Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $107, then we can calculate the cost per DVD as follows: Cost per DVD = Total cost / Number of DVDs $107 / 5 (number of packages) = $21.40 per DVD Now, if there is a discount of $9 off each DVD, then the new price per DVD would be: New price per DVD = Original price - Discount $21.40 - $9 = $12.40 So, to find out how many packages of DVDs you can buy for $93, we need to divide the total amount by the new price per DVD: Number of packages = Total amount / New price per DVD $93 / $12.40 = 7.5 packages Therefore, you can buy 7.5 packages of DVDs for $93.
"Response:  If each DVD box costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 for packaging, then we need to calculate how much you have to pay for shipping as follows:

$76 (cost of each DVD box) - $25 (discount for packaging) = $51

So, you have to pay $51 for shipping."
"Response:  If you have $104 dollars to spend, and each DVD costs $26, then we can calculate how many DVDs you can buy as follows:
$104 / $26 = 4
So, you can buy 4 DVDs with your $104."
Response:  If we have 28 dollars to spend and we want to buy two packages of DVDs, then each package must cost less than 14 dollars (28 / 2 = 14). Therefore, the price of each package is 14 dollars.
Response:  We have 18 bananas in total. If we divide them into groups of size 2, then each group will contain half of the total number of bananas, which is 9 bananas (since 18 / 2 = 9). So there are 9 groups of bananas.
"Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas and each group contains 187 bananas. So, we need to calculate how many bananas are in total:

140 x 187 = 23,690 bananas

Therefore, there are 23,690 bananas in the collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges. If we divide the bananas into groups of 7, then each group will have 28 bananas (203 / 7 = 28). Now, if we divide the oranges into groups of 95, then each group will have 0.7 oranges (63 / 95 = 0.7). Therefore, each group has 28 bananas and 0.7 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in total. If we divide the bananas into groups of 47, then the remaining bananas will be 142 / 47 = 3.  Similarly, if we divide the oranges into groups of 178, then the remaining oranges will be 356 / 178 = 2. So, each group of oranges has 2 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and he has 392 bananas altogether. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group. In this case, we have: Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2 Therefore, each group contains 2 bananas.
"Response:  If there are 18 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains 18 bananas, then the total number of bananas is:

18 x 18 = 324

So, if Philip has 180 bananas in his collection, that means he has 180 / 324 = approximately 56% of his total banana collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas and they are divided into two groups of equal size. Therefore, each group contains half of the total number of bananas, which is 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145). Since we also know that the pomegranates are divided into 93 groups, each group must contain an equal number of pomegranates as there are bananas in each group. So, the number of pomegranates in each group is 145/93 = 16.
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas altogether. If we divide the oranges into 16 groups, then each group will have how many oranges?  So, the number of oranges in one group is 16 x 38 = 576. Therefore, the size of the orange group is 576.
Response:  If Brenda has prepared 38 piškotkov and each of them contains 19 piškotkov, then we can calculate the total number of piškotkov as follows: Total number of piškotkov = Number of piškotkov per package x Number of packages = 19 x 38 = 702 piškotkov Therefore, Brenda has prepared 702 piškotkov for her guests.
Response:  If Brenda has prepared 14 people with 30 pişkots each, then she has prepared in total 14 x 30 = 420 pişkots.
Response:  If Brenda has prepared 22 piškotkov and she had to reject 17 of them, then we can assume that each person would have an equal number of piškotkov. So, if there are x people in total, then each person would have x/2 = 11 piškotkov (since 22 divided by 2 is 11). Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  If Brenda made 18 piškotkov and 10 guests arrived, then each guest received 18/10 = 1.8 piškotka. However, only 9 guests actually came, so each of them received 1.8 x 9 = 16.2 piškotka.
Response:  If Brenda has ordered 14 pişkoteks for two guests and each guest is supposed to have an equal number of pişkoteks, then we can conclude that each guest will receive half of the total number of pişkoteks. Therefore, each guest will receive 7 pişkoteks (half of 14).
Response:  If Brenda has prepared 10 piškoteks for guests and each guest has two piškotkes, then the number of guests is 10/2 = 5 guests. Therefore, Brenda has prepared piškotkes for 5 guests.
Response:  If Frank had 42 bonbons and divided them equally between two bowls, then each bowl would contain 42/2 = 21 bonbons.
"Response:  If Frank had $N$ pieces of candy and he divided them equally among $M$ boxes, then each box contained $\frac{N}{M}$ pieces of candy. Since there are $33$ pieces in each box, we can write:
$$\frac{N}{M} = \frac{33}{1}$$
Now, if Frank had $26$ boxes, then the total number of pieces of candy he had is:
$$N = 26 \times \frac{33}{1} = 840$$
So, Frank had $840$ pieces of candy."
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 bonbons and lost 24 of them. So he has 9 remaining bonbons (33 - 24 = 9). Now we need to divide these 9 bonbons into equal parts in 3 containers with 9 bonbons each. To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to find out how many groups or parts you have. In this case, we are dividing 9 bonbons by 3 containers. So, we will get 3 containers with 9 bonbons each. Therefore, Frank has 3 containers with 9 bonbons each.
"Response:  If Frank gave 11 sweets in each bag, and he has 22 bags of sweets, then we can calculate how many bags he has as follows:

Number of bags = Number of sweets / Number of sweets per bag
= 22 sweets / 11 sweets per bag
= 2 bags

Therefore, Frank has 2 bags of sweets."
"Response:  If Frank has given some sweets to his friend in two batches of 8 and 8 sweets respectively, then we can find out how many sweets are there in each batch as follows:

Batch 1 (8 sweets): Since Frank gave 8 sweets in this batch, let's call them x. So, we have x sweets in Batch 1.

Batch 2 (8 sweets): Similarly, since Frank gave another 8 sweets in this batch, let's call them y. So, we have y sweets in Batch 2.

Now, we know that the total number of sweets is equal to the sum of sweets in both batches:
x + y = 16 (since there are 16 sweets in total)

Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 4 and y = 12

So, there are 4 sweets in the first batch and 12 sweets in the second batch."
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 Škatels of Trefoils and each Škat contains 14 Trefoils, then we need to find out how many Škatels she needs to deliver. To do this, we can divide the total number of Trefoils (25) by the number of Trefoils in each Škat (14): 25 / 14 = 3+7=10 Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 10 Škatels of Trefoils.
"Response:  If she sold 10 sets of three-leaf clovers and each set contains 3 three-leaf clovers, then the total number of three-leaf clovers she sold is:

10 x 3 = 30
So, if she needs to deliver 5 sets of three-leaf clovers, the number of three-leaf clovers she will deliver is:

30 / 5 = 6
Therefore, there are 6 three-leaf clovers in each set that she delivers."
"Response:  We know that there were 67 normal sodas and 9 diet sodas. To find out how many more normal sodas than diet sodas, we need to subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of sodas = Number of normal sodas + Number of diet sodas

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

67 + 9 =?

Solving for x (the number of normal sodas), we get:

67 + 9 = 76

Therefore, there are 76 normal sodas and 9 diet sodas."
Response:  We know that there were 22 normal sodas and 61 diet sodas. To find out how many diet sodas are more than regular sodas, we need to subtract the number of regular sodas from the total number of sodas. So, the difference between diet sodas and regular sodas is: 61 - 22 = 39. Therefore, there were 39 more diet sodas than regular sodas.
Response:  We know that there were 30 normal sodas and 8 diet sodas. So, altogether we have: 30 + 8 = 38 steklenic. Therefore, they had 38 glasses of soda together.
Response:  We know that there were 79 regular sodas and 53 diet sodas. To find out how many more regular sodas than diet sodas, we can subtract their numbers: 79 - 53 = 26. So, there were 26 more regular sodas than diet sodas.
Response:  We know that there were 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we can subtract their numbers: 83 - 54 = 29. So, there were 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there were 17 glasses of juice and 9 of them were regular (not diet). So, the number of diet drinks is 9 - 9 = 0. Therefore, they had no diet sodas.
Response:  We know that there were 19 diet sodas and 60 regular sodas available for purchase at the store. To find out how many more regular sodas than diet sodas were sold, we need to subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas available. So, if we subtract 19 from 60, we get: 60 - 19 = 41. Therefore, there were 41 more regular sodas than diet sodas sold at the store.
Response:  We know that there were 72 glasses of regular soda and 32 glasses of diet soda. So, altogether we have 104 glasses (72 + 32). Now, let's compare this number with the number of apples - 78. Therefore, more than 78 glasses of soda were present in the store. The correct answer is 104 - 78 = 26.
Response:  We know that there were 36 jabok and 80 normal glasses. To find out how many more than jabok have, we need to subtract the number of normal glasses from the total number of glasses:  Total number of glasses = 36 + 80 = 116. So, they had 116 - 36 = 80 more glasses than jabok.
Response:  We know that there were 30 glasses of juice and 28 normal glasses. So, we can say that the number of diet sodas is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, they had 2 diet sodas.
Response:  We know that in trade they had four glasses of diet soda and 79 more glasses of regular soda than diet soda. So if they had x glasses of regular soda, then we can write an equation as follows: 4 + 79x = 153 (total number of glasses). Now we need to find out what value of x will satisfy this equation. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 79: 4 + x = 153 / 79. Solving for x, we get x = 20. Therefore, they had 20 glasses of regular soda.
"Response:  We know that there were 57 normal sodas and 26 diet sodas. So, altogether we have:

57 + 26 = 83

Therefore, they had 83 glasses of soda together."
"Response:  We know that there were 81 glasses of regular soda and 60 glasses of diet soda. To find out how many more regular soda glasses than diet soda glasses there are, we can subtract the number of diet soda glasses from the total number of soda glasses:

81 - 60 = 21
So, there were 21 more glasses of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that there were 49 normal sodas and 40 diet sodas. So, if we take these two quantities together, we have:

Total number of sodas = 49 + 40 = 89

So, 89 steklenic sodas were taken from the store."
"Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 295 visitors the previous day, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22

So, there were 22 more visitors at Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day."
"Response:  If there were 246 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day and they visited the palace over a period of 25 days, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:

Average daily visitors = Total visitors / Number of days
= 246 / 25
= 10.24 (or approximately 10 visitors per day)"
Response:  We know that there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day and 666 visitors on the current day. So, if we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day, we get: 666 - 100 = 566 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the current day. Therefore, there are 566 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the current day than on the previous day.
Response:  We know that in the last 327 days, there were 406 visitors to Buckingham Palace. So, if we subtract this number from the total of 132 visitors on the day after the eclipse, we get: 132 - 406 = -274 visitors. Therefore, in the previous day before the eclipse, there were -274 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
Response:  We know that in the previous day (yesterday), there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace. If we add this number to the total number of visitors over the last 85 days (which is given as 829), then we get:  Number of visitors yesterday + Total number of visitors over last 85 days = 45 + 829 = 874 visitors So, there were 874 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after the eclipse.
Response:  We know that there were 557 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel visited and 188 visitors the previous day. So, in total, there were 557 + 188 = 745 visitors to Buckingham Palace over those 57 days.
"Response:  We know that there were 600 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day and 661 visitors on the current day. So, we can write an equation: 600 + x = 661 where ""x"" represents the number of additional visitors on the current day. Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we can subtract 600 from both sides of the equation: x = 661 - 600 = 61 Therefore, there were 61 additional visitors to Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day."
Response:  We know that there were 419 visitors yesterday and 103 visitors the day before. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 522 visitors in total. Now, let's subtract the number of visitors today (92) from the total number of visitors: 522 - 92 = 430. Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before that day was 430.
Response:  We know that there were 471 visitors yesterday and 808 visitors the day before. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 1280 visitors in total over those two days. Now, let's subtract the number of visitors from the previous 89 days (which is 89 x 3 = 267). Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days is 267 - 1280 = -1013.
Response:  If there were 191 visitors yesterday and 457 today, then the difference between the two days is 457 - 191 = 266 visitors.  Since there are 245 days between the two dates, the average number of visitors per day is (266 / 245) = 10.8 visitors per day. So, there were approximately 10.8 more visitors at Buckingham Palace that day than in the previous 245 days.
Response:  We know that 30 grams of glue are needed for the list and we have already used 159 grams so far. So, to find out how many grams of glue are left, we can subtract the amount already used (159) from the total amount required (628): 628 - 159 = 469 grams of glue remain. Therefore, there are 469 grams of glue remaining.
Response:  We know that for leather gluing, we need 35 grams of wax together with 49 grams of dye. So, if we already have 260 grams of wax (which is equal to 7 times 35), then we still need 100 - 7 x 35 = 23 grams more wax to complete the job. Therefore, there are 260 - 23 = 237 grams of wax left after using it all up.
Response:  We know that for leather gluing, we need 100 grams of wax (wax). For dyeing, we need 57 grams of dye (dye). So far, we have a total of 100 + 57 = 157 grams of materials used. Now, let's calculate how much wax is left over after dyeing: 157 - 57 = 100 grams of wax remains. Therefore, there are 100 grams of wax already available.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of glue needed is 166 grams and we have 20 grams left. So, to find out how much more glue is needed, we can divide the remaining amount (20 grams) by the required amount (166 grams):

20/166 = 0.12 or approximately 12%
So, the vase needs an additional 12% of the original amount of glue, which is:

166 x 0.12 = 20 g
Therefore, the vase still needs 20 grams of glue."
Response:  We know that there are 557 grams of wax and we need to find out how many grams of wax are needed for feathers. So, if we have 17 grams of wax left after using it all up, then initially, we had 557 - 17 = 540 grams of wax. Therefore, the number of grams of wax needed for feathers is 540 grams.
Response:  We know that the current amount of wax is 11 grams and the required amount for feathers is 492 grams. So we need to find out how many times 11 grams can be divided into 492 grams. To do this, we divide 11 grams by 492 grams: 11 / 492 = x Where x represents the number of times 11 grams can be divided into 492 grams. Solving for x, we get: x = 40 Therefore, the remaining amount of wax needed is 40 grams.
Response:  If there are 94 farmers who will fill 90 barrels of grapes in six days, that means each farmer will fill one barrel every 6/94 = 1/27 barrels per day. So, on the last day (day 6), all 94 farmers together will fill 90 barrels / 94 farmers = 3 barrels per farmer. Therefore, there will be 3 + 3 = 6 barrels filled on the last day.
Response:  If there are 266 villagers who will fill 90 barrels of grapes in five days, then each day they will fill 18 barrels (90/5 = 18).
Response:  We know that there are 294 farmers who work for him and they fill 244 barrels of grapes every day. So, if we multiply this number with the number of days (146), we get:  Number of barrels of grapes filled = 244 x 146 = 35,084 barrels of grapes.
Response:  If they can fill 221 sod grozda per day and work for 77 days, then they will have filled 16,477 sod grozda during that time (221 x 77 = 16,477).
"Response:  If Vinograd has 57 posts and he visited them all in one day, then each post would have been visited once. So, if there are 252 villagers who told him that they could fill 108 barrels of grapes per day, then the total number of barrels filled per day is equal to the number of posts multiplied by the number of villagers. Therefore, we can write:

Barrels = Posts x Villagers
= 57 x 252
= 1434 barrels/day
Now, let's find out how many days it will take to fill 58 barrels. To do this, we divide the total number of barrels by the number of barrels filled per day:

Days = Barrels / Barrels/Day
= 58 / 1434
= 0.4 (or 40%) days
Therefore, it will take approximately 40% of a day or 0.4 days to fill 58 barrels of grapes."
"Response:  If it takes him 8 days to fill 8 jugs of grape juice (as told by 36 women), then he will need:

$$ \text {Days} = \frac{\text{Quantity wanted}}{\text{Quantity given}} $$

So, in this case:

$$ \text {Days} = \frac{240\text{ jugs}}{8\text{ jugs/day}} = 30\text{ days} $$

Therefore, he will need $30$ days to fill $240$ jugs of grape juice."
"Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has an equal number of marine animals as the total number of aquariums. So, if we divide the total number of marine animals (52) by the number of aquariums (26), we get the average number of marine animals per aquarium = 52 / 26 = 2.
Therefore, each aquarium has approximately 2 marine animals."
Response:  We know that there are 40 marine animals in total and each aquarium has two fish. So we can start with the first aquarium:  Aquarium 1: 2 fish (let's call them Fish A and Fish B). Now we have 38 remaining fish for the next aquarium.  Aquarium 2: 2 fish (let's call them Fish C and Fish D). Now we have 36 remaining fish for the next aquarium.  Continue this process until all 40 fish are accounted for. Therefore, the number of aquariums is: 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for marine animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. In each aquarium, there are 39 animals. So, to find out how many marine animals Tyler has, we can multiply the number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium:  Number of marine animals = 56 x 39 = 2240 marine animals Therefore, Tyler has 2240 marine animals.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for marine animals. In each aquarium, there are 46 animals. So, to find out how many marine animals Tyler has, we can multiply the number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium:  Number of marine animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium  Number of marine animals = 22 x 46  Number of marine animals = 952 marine animals Therefore, Tyler has 952 marine animals.
Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for marine animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. In each aquarium, there are 19 animals. So, we need to find out how many animals there are altogether. To do this, we can multiply the number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium:  Number of aquariums for marine animals = 15  Number of animals in each aquarium (marine) = 19  Total number of marine animals = 15 x 19 = 285  Similarly, we can calculate the total number of freshwater animals using the same formula:  Number of aquariums for freshwater animals = 62  Number of animals in each aquarium (freshwater) = 19  Total number of freshwater animals = 62 x 19 = 1,238  Therefore, there are 285 marine animals and 1,238 freshwater animals in total.
Response:  If we buy white shirts in packs of 13, then if Mom buys 39 white shirts, she will have to buy 39 / 13 = 3 packets of white shirts.
Response:  If Mama buys 66 white shirts and each package contains 3 white shirts, then... We can start counting from 1 to 66 like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,... (and so on). So, there will be 22 packages of white shirts (66 / 3 = 22).
Response:  If Mama buys 28 packages of white socks, and each package contains 56 white socks, then we can calculate how many white socks are in each package as follows: Number of white socks per package = Total number of white socks / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2 Socks per package. Therefore, there are 2 white socks in each package.
"Response:  If Mama buys 57 packets of white shirts and each packet contains 53 white shirts, then she will have a total of:

57 packets x 53 shirts/packet = 3011 shirts
So, Mama will have 3011 white shirts in total."
Response:  If Mama has 51 white magic cards and she can buy them in packs of 3, then we need to find out how many packs she will have. We know that there are 51 white magic cards in total, so each pack will contain 51/3 = 17 cards. Therefore, Mama will have 51 / 3 = 17 packs of white magic cards.
Response:  If Mama buys 70 white shirts and she can buy 14 packages of them, then each package must contain how many white shirts? We know that Mama bought 70 white shirts, so we need to divide this number by the number of packages she can buy: 70 / 14 = 5. So, each package contains 5 white shirts.
"Response:  We have 4 vessels with equal number of marbles (let's call it x). So, we have 36 marbles total. Since each vessel has an equal number of marbles, we can write:
x = 4(x/4)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 4(x/4)
x^2 = 36
x = 9
So, each vessel has 9 marbles."
"Response:  If I have 33 pebbles and each jar has 11 pebbles, then:

* The first jar will have 11 pebbles (since it is empty).
* The second jar will have 22 pebbles (11 from the previous jar + 11 new pebbles).
* The third jar will have 33 pebbles (22 from the previous two jars + 11 new pebbles).

So, I will have 33 pebbles in total."
Response:  If each bottle has 41 pills and you have 53 bottles of pills, then we can calculate how many pills you have as follows:  Number of pills = Total number of bottles x Number of pills per bottle So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of pills = 53 x 41 = 2203 pills Therefore, you have 2203 pills.
Response:  We have 14 pebbles and 7 bags with equal number of pebbles. So, each bag has 14/7 = 2 pebbles. Therefore, each bag contains 2 pebbles.
Response:  If each jar has 3 pebbles and there are 21 jars, then we have:  Number of pebbles = Total number of jars x Number of pebbles per jar  Number of pebbles = 21 x 3  Number of pebbles = 63
Response:  We have 26 vreček with equal number of pips. If we have 15 bombons and 52 pips, that means each bombon has 52/15 = 3 pips. So, we have 26 x 3 = 78 pips in total. Therefore, you have 78 pips.
Response:  We have 14 vrečk with equal number of pebbles (pebble x). So we can write an equation: 14v = x(pebble)  Since we have 28 pebbles and 86 sweets, we know that 28 + 86 = 114. Therefore, we can rewrite the previous equation as follows: 14v = x(pebble) + 114 Now let's solve for v: 14v = x(pebble) + 114 Divide both sides by 14: v = x(pebble) / 14 + 114 / 14 Substitute x(pebble) = 28: v = 28/14 + 114/14 = 39 vrečk With this value of v, we know how many vrečk you have.
Response:  If Postar has to deliver 5 letters in each block and he sends 25 letters for each house in the block, then we can calculate the number of houses in the block as follows: Number of houses = Total number of letters / Number of letters per house = 100 (letters) / 25 (letters per house) = 4 houses in each block. Therefore, there are 4 houses in each block.
Response:  Postman must send 9 letters to each house in every block. If there are 20 houses in a block, then he needs to send 9 x 20 = 180 letters in total. So, the correct answer is 180.
Response:  If there are six houses in the street and each block has 6 houses (as stated), then there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 houses in the entire street.  Now, if the postman needs to deliver 24 pieces of mail to each block, that means he will need to deliver a total of 24 x 6 = 144 pieces of mail in the entire street. Therefore, the postman must deliver 144 / 36 = 4 pieces of mail to each house in the street.
"Response:  If Postman sends 14 unwanted letters to each house in a block, and he has to deliver two packets of mail to every block, then the number of houses in a block is:

Number of houses = Total number of letters / Number of packets per block
= 14 x (Total number of blocks) / 2
= 14 x (Number of blocks - 1) / 2
= 70 / 2
= 35
Therefore, there are 35 houses in a block."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and he needs to deliver 32 packages per house, then the total number of packages he needs to deliver is:  Total packages = Number of houses x Number of packages per house = 20 x 32 = 640 packages. Therefore, the postman must deliver 640 packages in total.
Response:  Postman must send 30 letters to 78 blocks. If there are 19 houses on the street, each house will receive an average of 1.65 letters (30/19).
Response:  Postman must send 8 packages to 55 blocks. If he sends 32 letters to each house in a block, then there are houses in a block.
Response:  Postman must send 4 packages to each house in 81 blocks. Since there are 12 houses in each street, he needs to send 4 x 12 = 48 packages per street. Therefore, he should send 81 x 48 = 3656 packages in total.
Response:  Postman must send 4 letters to each house in every street of the 16 blocks. If there are 17 houses in each street, then...  Therefore, the number of letters that postman must deliver is: 4 x 16 = 64 letters.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles to distribute into groups of 4. To find out how many groups we can make, let's divide both numbers: 10 / 4 = 2 (groups)  So, there will be 2 groups of 4 each.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs to share equally among groups of 5 people each. To find out how many groups we can make, we need to divide the total number of marbles (10) by 5, which gives us 2. So, there will be 2 groups.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the collection of eggs into groups of 11, and each group has two eggs, then...
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. She wants to divide them into 4 groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  Since there are 8 eggs total, each group can have up to 2 eggs (since you can't have a fraction of an egg). Therefore, Group A will have 2 eggs, Group B will have 2 eggs, Group C will have 1 egg, and Group D will have 1 egg.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  To do this, we can use division.  If Rebecca divides the 15 eggs equally among the three groups, then each group will get 5 eggs.  Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide her collection of eggs into groups of six. Since she has 18 eggs, we can start by dividing them equally among six groups, which means each group will contain 3 eggs. Now, let's calculate how many total groups we can make using the remaining items:

* Bananas: 72 / 6 = 12 groups (since each group contains 6 bananas)
* Marshmallows: 66 / 6 = 11 groups (since each group contains 6 marshmallows)

Therefore, there will be 12 + 11 = 23 groups in total."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and wants to divide them into groups of three. So, she will need at least 33 groups (since each group needs 3 bananas). Now, we also know that she has 9 eggs, which can be divided into 3 groups (since each group needs 3 eggs). Finally, she has 27 marbles, which can also be divided into 3 groups (since each group needs 9 marbles). Therefore, there will be a total of 33 + 3 = 36 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. If she wants to divide them into groups of 5, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these resources. To do this, we will use division.  Division is a way of dividing something into equal parts or groups. In this case, we want to divide 20 eggs into groups of 5 each. So, we can write an equation like this: 20 / 5 = x, where x is the number of groups Rebecca can make. Now we solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5: 100 = 5x. This means that Rebecca can make 20 groups of 5 eggs each. Therefore, Rebecca has more than 5 marbles (6) because she has 20 eggs and only needs 5 to fill one group. So, the answer is 20 - 5 = 15.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these numbers. To do this, we can use division. So, let's divide 12 (the number of eggs) by 20 (the desired group size): 12 / 20 = 0.6. This means that Rebecca can make 6 groups of 20 eggs each using her 12 eggs. Now, let's check if she has more than 5 marbles left after dividing the eggs into groups. So, we subtract the number of marbles from the total number of marbles: 5 - 5 = 0. This means that Rebecca has exactly 0 marbles left after dividing the eggs into groups. Therefore, the answer is 0.
"Response:  If Luke got 11 points every round and he played 154 rounds, then we can calculate how many times he scored 11 points as follows:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ times\ scoring\ 11\ points = 154 \div 11 = 13 \times 11 = 143 $$
So, Luke played $143$ rounds."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of Trivial Pursuit and won 46 points in each round, then he has won a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of points} = \text{Number of rounds} \times \text{Points per round} $$
= $177$ $\times$ $46$
= $8328$

Therefore, Luke has scored $8328$ points in the game of Trivial Pursuit."
"Response:  If Luke received 84 points after two rounds of a trivial game and he got the same number of points in each round, then we can write an equation:

Luke's score after 1st round = Luke's score after 2nd round

We know that Luke scored 84 points in total, so we can set up another equation:

Luke's score after 1st round + Luke's score after 2nd round = 84

Now let's solve for Luke's score in the first round:

Luke's score after 1st round = Luke's score after 2nd round - Luke's score after 1st round
= 84 - (Luke's score after 1st round)

So, if Luke scored x points in the first round, his score after the second round would be:

Luke's score after 2nd round = 84 - x

Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in the first round."
Response:  If Luke gained 146 points in each round of the game and played 157 rounds, then he gained a total of 146 x 157 = 21,382 points in the entire game.
Response:  If Luke got 3 points in each round and he answered correctly, then his total score after one round would be 3 + 3 = 6.  Therefore, if he answered correctly in every round, his total score at the end of 78 rounds would be 78 x 6 = 468. So, Luke played 468 rounds.
Response:  If Emily had two beads and could make 32 necklaces, then she must have used each bead to make half of one necklace (since there are only two beads). So, if we divide 32 by 2, we get 16. Therefore, Emily needed 16 beads for one ogrlica.
"Response:  If Emily made 11 ogrlic and each ogrlica contains 28 kroglic, then we can calculate how many kroglic Emily has altogether as follows:

Number of kroglic = Number of ogrlic x Number of kroglic per ogrlica
= 11 x 28
= 308 kroglic
Therefore, Emily had 308 kroglic in total."
Response:  If each bead has 8 beads and she has 16 beads, then we can calculate as follows:  Number of beads = Total number of beads / Number of beads per strand  In this case, the total number of beads is 16 (given) and the number of beads per strand is 8 (also given). So, to find out how many strands Emily can make, we divide the total number of beads by the number of beads per strand:  Number of strands = Total number of beads / Number of beads per strand  Number of strands = 16 / 8  Number of strands = 2 Therefore, Emily can make 2 strands of beads using her 16 beads.
Response:  We know that Emily made 18 ogrlic for her friends and she had 6 kroglic (cubes). So, we can calculate how many cubes are needed to make one ogrlica as follows: Number of cubes per ogrlica = Total number of cubes / Number of ogrlicas = 6 kroglic / 18 ogrlic = 0.375 kroglic per ogrlica Now, let's find out how many kroglic are needed to make one ogrlica: Number of kroglic per ogrlica = Total number of kroglic / Number of ogrlicas = 6 kroglic / 18 ogrlic = 0.375 kroglic per ogrlica Therefore, Emily needed 0.375 kroglic to make each ogrlica.
Response:  If Emily made four ogrlice with each ogrlice containing 5 kroglic, then she has made a total of 4 x 5 = 20 kroglic. So, Emily had 20 kroglic in total.
Response:  We know that Emily has 72 friends and she wants to give each of them an earring from her collection of beads. Since each ogrlica has three beads, we can calculate how many ogrlic Emily needs as follows: Number of ogrlic = Total number of friends / Number of beads per ogrlica So, in this case, the total number of friends is 72, and there are 3 beads per ogrlica. Therefore, the number of ogrlic needed by Emily is:  Number of ogrlic = 72 / 3 = 24 ogrlic
Response:  We know that Emily has 43 friends and each friend needs one bead for their rosary. So, she needs 43 beads altogether. Since she had five rosaries with 5 beads each, she needed to make 8 beads more (43 - 5 = 38). Therefore, Emily needed 38 beads for her rosary.
Response:  We know that Emily has 44 friends and she gave each of them an earring. So, the total number of earrings given is 44 x 1 = 44. Since each earring contains 2 kroglic, we have 44 x 2 = 88 kroglic in total. Therefore, Emily had 88 kroglic.
Response:  We know that out of 819058 children from the district of Lawrence, 80% (or 647336) went to camp and 20% (or 171722) stayed at home. So, we need to find the difference between these two numbers to get the number of children who remained at home. The difference is:  Number of children remaining at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp = 668278 - 647336 = 211542 children. Therefore, more than twice as many children remained at home compared to those who went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 202958 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 777622 children who stayed at home. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp Now, let's solve for the number of children who stayed at home: Number of children staying at home = 777622 = 202958 + x Where 'x' is the number of children who went to camp. To find out how many children went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children staying at home = 202958 + x - 777622 = x Solving for 'x', we get: x = 134860 Therefore, there were 134860 children who stayed at home.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total and 629424 of them go to summer camp. So, we need to find out how many children stay at home. To do this, we can divide the number of children who don't go to summer camp (i.e., those who stay at home) by the total number of children. Therefore, the number of children who stay at home is:  Number of children who stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who go to summer camp  Number of children who stay at home = 898051 - 629424  Number of children who stay at home = 268527  Therefore, 268527 children stay at home.
Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County and during summer vacation, 274,865 of them will stay at home while others will go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children will go to camp. To do this, we can divide the number of children who won't stay at home (i.e., those going to camp) by the total number of children in the county. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children staying at home = 313,473 - 274,865 = 38,608
Response:  We know that out of 907611 children from the district of Lawrence, 455682 will go to camp and 451839 will stay at home. So, we can calculate the number of children who will stay at home as follows: Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp = 907611 - 455682 = 451839 Therefore, there are 451839 children who will stay at home in the district of Lawrence.
"Response:  We know that out of 800059 children from Lawrence county, 8000 went to camp. So, we have:

Number of children left at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp
= 828521 - 8000
= 748521
Therefore, there are 748521 children left at home in Lawrence county."
Response:  We know that out of 61619 children in the district of Lawrence, 3045 remained at home, while 5114 went to camp. Therefore, the total number of children in the district is 91676. So, we can calculate the number of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who remained at home Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 3045 = 88231  Therefore, 88231 children from the district of Lawrence went to summer camp.
Response:  We know that out of 34044 children from the district of Lawrence, 34044 x 5 = 170220 children attended camp and 134867 remained at home.  Therefore, the number of children who attended camp is equal to 170220 - 134867 = 35353.
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children from the district of Lawrence, 30000 went to camp and 580796 remained at home. This means that there are 610769 - 30000 = 580769 children who did not go to camp. Since 22 children came from other areas, we add them to this number: 580769 + 22 = 580991. Therefore, there are 580991 children in the district of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that out of 644997 children from the district of Lawrence, 893835 went to camp and 78 children came from other places. So we can write an equation: Number of children from Lawrence = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp + Number of children from other places Now let's solve for the number of children from Lawrence: Number of children from Lawrence = 644997 - (893835 + 78) = 644997 - 894613 = -250616 Children from Lawrence were at home.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than three apples and he has 9 apples in total. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie must have x - 3 = 6 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. Therefore, the difference between Adam's apple count and Jackie's apple count is: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:  Number of apples Jackie has - Number of apples Adam has = 10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam has 6 apples and Jackie has 4 more than Adam. So, if we add 4 to 6, we get 10. Therefore, Jackie has 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 9 jaboks and he shares them equally with Jackie. So, if they have together 7 jabokls, then Adam must have at least 4 jabokls (since 9 + 4 = 13).
Response:  We know that Adam has 12 apples and he gave 3 to Jackie. So, Adam had 12 - 3 = 9 apples left. Now we know that Jackie has 9 more apples than Adam, so Jackie has 9 + 9 = 18 apples. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Adam has 8 + 8 = 16 apples. Therefore, Adam has 16 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So together they have 2 apples. Now we are told that there are 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. Therefore, the total number of apples is: 4 + 10 = 14 (Adam) + 6 = 20 (total). So Adam has 14 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam has more pets than Jackie. So, we can start with Adam's pets first. According to the question, Adam has 25 dogs and 3 cats. Now let's move to Jackie's pets. She has 89 oranges and 11 apples. Since an apple is not a type of pet, we can ignore it. Therefore, Jackie has 89 oranges. Now, we need to find out how many j... (read more)

Solution: The correct answer is 46.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Adam has 25 dogs and 3 cats, which means he has a total of 28 pets. Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, so she has a total of 100 fruits. Since Adam has more pets than Jackie, he must have at least 100 - 28 = 72 fruits left over after giving all his pets to Jackie. However, since Jackie already has 89 oranges, Adam cannot give her any more oranges. Therefore, the only thing Adam can give to Jackie are j... (read more)"
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 31 cookies and today she has baked 270 more. So, altogether she has baked 301 cookies until now. Additionally, she plans to bake 419 more before dawn. Therefore, the total number of cookies Helen will have baked by dawn is: 301 + 419 = 720 cookies.
Response:  If Helen baked 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 flower-shaped cookie today, then she has baked a total of 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate chip cookies so far. Additionally, if she baked 484 chocolate chip cookies this morning, then the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen has baked is 141 + 484 = 625 chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, Helen has baked 625 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  If Helen baked 527 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and plans to bake 86 more today, then she will have baked a total of 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate chip cookies so far. Since there are also 554 chocolate chip cookies that she wants to bake today, we can calculate the total number of chocolate chip cookies that Helen has baked as follows: Total number of chocolate chip cookies = Number baked yesterday + Number baked today - Number already baked = 613 + 554 - 0 = 1157 chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, Helen has baked 1157 chocolate chip cookies so far.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 flower-shaped cookies. Today, she is going to bake 85 rectangular cookies and 403 chocolate chip cookies. So, altogether, Helen has baked 628 cookies (144 + 397 + 85 + 403).
Response:  If Helen made 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and she said that she baked 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning, then we can calculate how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked in total as follows: Total number of chocolate chip cookies = Yesterday's number + Today's number - Number already eaten So, the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked is: Total number of chocolate chip cookies = 19 + 237 - x Where 'x' represents the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen already ate. Since Helen did not mention anything about eating any chocolate chip cookies, let's assume that 'x' is equal to zero. Therefore, the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked is: Total number of chocolate chip cookies = 19 + 237 = 256 chocolate chip cookies
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 flower-shaped cookies. Today, she is planning to make 75 chocolate cookies with strawberries and 66 chocolate chips. So, yesterday, Helen baked more than twice as many chocolate chip cookies as she plans to make today. Specifically, she baked 328 (197 + 46) chocolate chip cookies yesterday compared to 75 today.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate cookies and 300 flower-shaped cookies. Today, she is going to bake 280 flower-shaped cookies and 359 chocolate cookies. So, yesterday, Helen baked more chocolate cookies than today. The difference between the number of chocolate cookies baked yesterday and today is:  519 - 359 = 160 Therefore, Helen baked 160 more chocolate cookies yesterday than today.
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 dogs and her friend has 59 dogs. So we need to find out how many more dogs Katie has than her friend. To do this, we can subtract the number of dogs her friend has from the number of dogs Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie has 22 more dogs than her friend.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 91 friends and her new friends have 88 friends. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 91 + 88 = 179. Now, let's compare this number with what is given about Katie's old friends. It says that they have 53 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends among all three groups of friends is 179 (Katie's new friends) + 53 (old friends) = 232.
Response:  According to the question, Katie had 78 new games and her friends had 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
"Response: 
Katie had 84 new and 19 old games. Her friends had 8 new and 69 old games. So, together they have:
New games = Katie's new games + Friends' new games = 84 + 8 = 92
Old games = Katie's old games + Friends' old games = 19 + 69 = 88
Therefore, the total number of new games that Katie and her friends have is 92, and the total number of old games they have is 88."
Response:  We know that Katie had 62 new and 80 old games. Her friends had 73 new and 41 old games. So, we can write an equation: New games = 62 + 80 = 142 Old games = 73 + 41 = 114 Now, let's solve for the number of old games: Old games = 114 Therefore, Katie's friends had 114 old games.
Response:  If Katie has 63 DS games and her friends have 57 games, then we can say that Katie has 63 - 57 = 8 more games than her friends. So, Katie has 8 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie had 57 new games and her friends had 34 new games. So, the total number of new games for both is 57 + 34 = 91. Now, we need to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends. To do this, we subtract the number of new games her friends have from the number of new games Katie has: 91 - 34 = 57. Therefore, Katie has 57 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and then he gave $20 to Jason. So, Fred now has $40 left. Then, Jason earned $33 from washing cars. Therefore, the total amount of money Jason has is $33 + $20 = $53.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 last week and now he has $9 after doing laundry. So, his new amount is $9 + $86 = $95. Now, we need to find out how much money Jason had last week. According to the question, Jason had $5 last week. Therefore, their total amount of money together last week was $95 (Fred) + $5 (Jason) = $100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $19 before he and Jason went to buy an automobile. Then they bought an automobile and now Fred has $40. So, the amount of money Fred earned this weekend is: $40 - $19 = $21. Therefore, Fred earned $21 this weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and spent $21 on gas. So he has $93 left ($114 - $21 = $93). Now, we know that Jason earned $22 this week. Therefore, his total amount of money is $78 + $22 = $100. So, Jason earned $28 more than Fred this week ($100 - $93 = $28).
Response:  If Fred had $111 and spent $29 on gasoline (which is not mentioned in the passage), he would have $82 left. Then, if he earned $34 from washing cars, his new amount of money would be $82 + $34 = $116. So, the amount of money that Fred earned from washing cars is $116 - $82 = $34.  Similarly, if Jason had $40 and spent $17 on stamps (not mentioned in the passage), he would have $23 left. Then, if he earned $17 from delivering newspapers, his new amount of money would be $23 + $17 = $40. So, the amount of money that Jason earned from delivering newspapers is $40 - $23 = $17. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both boys is $34 + $17 = $51.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $3 before he started delivering newspapers and now has $63 after doing it for one week. So, he earned $60 ($63 - $3) during this time period.  Next, we know that Fred had $49 before he sold his car and now has $112 after selling it. Therefore, he earned $63 ($112 - $49) from selling his car.  Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money they both earned by adding their individual earnings: $60 + $63 = $123.  So, they both earned a total of $123 dollars from delivering newspapers and selling their car.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 and he gave $14 to someone else, so now he has $17 left ($31 - $14 = $17).  Secondly, we know that Fred had $78 and he spent $25 on something (not specified), so now he has $53 left ($78 - $25 = $53). Lastly, we are told that Jason made $14 from delivering newspapers, so now he has $31 + $14 = $45. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both Jason and Fred from delivering newspapers is $53 + $45 = $98.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 last week and he spent $16 on newspapers. So, his remaining amount of money is: $33 - $16 = $17. Then, we know that Fred also spent $74 on washing the car. So, his new remaining amount of money after paying for the car wash is: $17 - $74 = -$57. Therefore, Fred did not earn any money this weekend because he spent more than he earned.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 initially and then he spent some money on buying newspapers ($111) and washing cars ($34). So, his remaining amount of money is: $47 - $111 + $34 = $28. Therefore, Fred has $28 now.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg to start with and has lost 20 kg so far, then her current weight is: 71 - 20 = 51 kg.
"Response:  If Jesse currently weighs 27 kg and has lost 101 kg in total, then she must have started running at some point when her weight was higher than it is now. So let's assume that before starting to run, Jesse weighed x kg. Since she has lost 101 kg, we can write an equation:
x - 27 = 101
Now solve for x:
x = 138 kg
So, before starting to run, Jesse weighed 138 kg."
Response:  Before she started running every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. Now she weighs 66 kg. So, her original weight was 126 - 66 = 60 kg.
Response:  If Jessie started running every day and lost 35 kg (77 lbs), then she had 69 kg (152 lbs) before starting to run. So now she weighs: 69 - 35 = 34 kg (75 lbs).
Response:  In the first week (day 1 to day 7), she lost 50 kg = 50/7 x 114 = 39 kg.  In the second week (day 8 to day 14), she lost another 60 kg = 60/7 x 114 = 42 kg. So, after two weeks, her weight is 39 + 42 = 81 kg.
Response:  If she started at 9 kg and lost 62 kg in the first week, then her weight after one week is: 9 - 62 = 53 kg. In the second week, if she lost another 140 kg, then her weight after two weeks is: 53 - 140 = 87 kg. So, before starting to exercise, she weighed 87 kg.
Response:  First day (day 1):  Jesse started running and lost 56 kg. So her weight after one day is: $Jesse = 92 - 56 = 36$ kg.  Second day (day 2):  Jesse ran again and lost another 99 kg. So her weight after two days is: $Jesse = 36 - 99 = -63$ kg.
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the zoo enclosure. If 64 of the snakes hid, then we can subtract this number from the initial total to find out how many snakes are left. So, the answer is:  Snakes remaining = Initial snakes - Hidden snakes = 95 - 64 = 31.
Response:  We know that there were initially 97 aligators and then 40 of them hid. So, now we have to find out how many aligators are left. To do this, we can divide the total number of aligators (initially) by the number of aligators that did not hide:  $97$ aligators / $57$ aligators = $1.76$ aligators. Therefore, there are approximately $1.76$ aligators left in the cage after $40$ of them hid.
Response:  We know that there were initially 75 aligatorjev and 3 kače in the zoo enclosure. If 82 kač and 19 aligatorjev left the enclosure, then we can conclude that: Number of remaining aligatorjev = Initial number of aligatorjev - Number of aligatorjev that left the enclosure = 75 - 19 = 56 aligatorjev Therefore, 56 aligatorjev did not leave the enclosure.
Response:  If there were initially 79 animals in the enclosure and 24 snakes and 51 alligators left, then the total number of animals that left would be:  Snakes x Number of snakes = 24 x 20 = 480 Alligators x Number of alligators = 51 x 30 = 1530 Total number of animals leaving = 480 + 1530 = 1910 So, 1910 animals left the enclosure.
Response:  If he had 171 paraders at first and selected 134 yesterday, then today he will have 134 + (171 - 134) = 265 paraders left. So, after today, he will have 265 paraders.
Response:  If he had 160 paraders at first and then selected 56 yesterday, he had 160 - 56 = 104 paraders left. Then today he selected 41 more, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 paraders. Therefore, he had 145 paraders after both selection processes.
Response:  If he had 90 parrots in his garden yesterday and took 154 today, then there are 66 less parrots now (90 - 154 = 66). So, if he took 50 parrots today, that means he has taken half of the remaining parrots (50 / 2 = 25). Therefore, he has taken 25 parrots today.
Response:  If he had 175 parades and took 172 cucumbers, then he has 3 parades left (175 - 172 = 3). And if he had 77 cucumbers to start with, then he has 74 cucumbers left after taking 172 (77 - 172 = 74).
"Response:  We know that initially, there were 177 paradižnikov and 12 krompirjev on the farm. If he picked up 53 paradižnikov, then we can say that he left with x paradižnikov and y krompirjev, where x + y = 177 (since he did not pick up any krompirjev). Now, we are asked to find out how many paradižnikov and krompirjev he has left. Since he took away 53 paradižnikov, he has left with x - 53 paradižnikov. Similarly, since he did not pick up any krompirjev, he has left with y krompirjev. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of paradižnikov = x - 53; Number of krompirjev = y."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 105 green and 71 red sunflowers at the garden. If he picked up 137 sunflowers, then we can calculate how many are left as follows:

Green sunflowers = Initial number - Number picked = 105 - 137 = -32
Red sunflowers = Initial number - Number picked = 71 - 137 = -66
So, there are -32 green sunflowers and -66 red sunflowers left at the garden after picking 137 sunflowers."
Response:  If John used four nails to break large planks of wood, and he needed two nails for each wooden board, then he would need 8 nails in total (4 x 2 = 8). So, John needs 8 wooden boards to build his house.
"Response:  We know that for each big board (13 boards), John needs 17 nails to attach them and additionally he needs 8 nails for smaller boards. So we can write an equation: Number of nails needed = 17 x number of big boards + 8 x number of small boards To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small boards there are. According to the question, ""Za stene hiše je uporabil 13 velikih lesenih desk."" This means that there are 13 big boards. Now let's substitute this value into our equation: Number of nails needed = 17 x 13 + 8 x x Where x is the number of small boards. Since we want to find out how many nails John needs, we will subtract the number of nails he already has from the total number of nails needed: Number of nails needed - nails already used = 17 x 13 + 8 x x - 15 (nails already used) Substituting the values we have found so far, we get: Number of nails needed - 15 = 103 Now we can simplify the equation: Number of nails needed = 103 / 8 = 12.625 nails Therefore, John needs approximately 12.625 nails to attach all the boards."
Response:  If he used 11 pebbles to break big planks and each plank requires three pebbles for every piece of wood, then we can calculate how many pieces of wood there are as follows: Number of pieces of wood = Total number of pebbles / Number of pebbles per piece of wood  In this case, total number of pebbles is 11 + 8 = 19 pebbles. Since there are 3 pebbles per piece of wood, we have: Number of pieces of wood = 19 / 3 = 6 pieces of wood. So John needs 6 pieces of wood to build one side of the house.
Response:  We know that big boards require 15 pieces of shingles for every 12 big boards used, and small boards require 5 pieces of shingles for every 10 small boards used. So if we use 12 big boards and 10 small boards, we need a total of 15 + 5 = 20 pieces of shingles. Therefore, John needs 20 shingles to cover the roof of his house.
Response:  For each of the 4 walls (left and right), there are 2 boards needed, so for all 4 walls, we need 8 boards. Since each board requires 2 nails, we will need 16 nails in total. So, John needs 16 nails to build the fence.
Response:  We know that for each wooden board, John needs 74 kegs of wheat. So if he has used 8 large wooden boards, he will need 8 x 74 = 592 kegs of wheat in total.
Response:  For each big plate (velika plošča), we need 14 nails (žeblji). Since there are 12 big plates, we need 12 x 14 = 168 nails for the big plates.  For each small plate (mala plošča), we need 25 nails. Since there are 17 small plates, we need 17 x 25 = 425 nails for the small plates. In total, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 nails to build the fence around the house.
Response:  We know that Robin has some chewing gums and there are 3 pieces of gum in each package, so he has 42 / 3 = 14 packages of gum. Therefore, Robin has 14 packets of chewing gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of chewing gum and each package contains 23 pieces. So, Robin has a total of 43 x 23 = 997 pieces of chewing gum. Now, we are told that Robin also has eight additional chewing gums. Therefore, the final number of chewing gums that Robin has is 997 + 8 = 1005 pieces of chewing gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has some bones (žvečil) and in each package there are 7 pieces of bone. So, we can say that Robin has x packages of bones. Since Robin also has six little bones (žvečilk), we can add them to our calculation as well. Therefore, the total number of packages is equal to x + 6 = 41. Thus, Robin has 41 packages of bones.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of chewing gum and 13 packets of sweets. Each packet contains 4 pieces of each type of candy. So, we can calculate how many pieces of each kind of candy Robin has as follows: Chewing gum: 28 packets x 4 pieces/packet = 112 pieces Sweets: 13 packets x 4 pieces/packet = 52 pieces Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of chewing gum and 52 pieces of sweets.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packets of chewing gum and each packet contains 9 pieces. Therefore, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of chewing gum. Now, we are also given that Robin has 45 packets of candy, and each packet contains 9 pieces as well. So, Robin has 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy. In total, Robin has 189 + 405 = 594 pieces of sweets.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of chewing gum and 14 packets of sweets. Each packet contains 6 pieces. So, we can calculate how many pieces does Robin have as follows: Number of packets of chewing gum = 28 Packets of chewing gum contain 6 pieces each Total number of pieces of chewing gum = 28 x 6 = 168 pieces Number of packets of sweets = 14 Packets of sweets contain 6 pieces each Total number of pieces of sweets = 14 x 6 = 84 pieces Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of candy.
"Response:  If the machine can make three shirts per minute and there were 6 shirts in total, then we can calculate how many minutes it took for the machine to make all of them as follows:

Minutes = Total time / Time per shirt
= 6 shirts x 3 shirts/minute = 18 minutes
Therefore, the machine worked for 18 minutes."
Response:  The industrial machine can make four shirts in one minute, so it will take five minutes to make five shirts. Therefore, the number of shirts made by the machine is: 5 x 4 = 20 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts and today it made 44 shirts. So, yesterday the machine worked for x minutes and today it worked for (44 - 9) = 35 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 35 minutes yesterday.
Response:  The industrial machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 today. In one minute, it can make 8 shirts. So, to find out how many minutes the machine worked, we need to divide the total number of shirts it made by its capacity per minute:  Total shirts = 13 + 3 = 16 Minutes worked = Total shirts / Capacity per minute = 16 / 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  If yesterday the machine produced 9 shirts and today it produced 8 shirts, then we can say that the difference between the number of shirts produced yesterday and today is equal to the number of shirts produced today. So, the difference = 8 - 9 = -1. Therefore, the machine worked for -1 minute today.
"Response:  If yesterday he made four shirts and today he made eight, then the difference between the two days is four shirts. So, if we divide the number of shirts produced yesterday (four) by the time taken to produce one shirt (in minutes), we get:

4/minutes = x

Now, let's find out how many minutes it took to make each shirt:

x/4 = minutes

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 30

So, it took the machine 30 minutes to make each shirt. Therefore, the total time taken to make all ten shirts (eight + two) is:

Total time = 8 + 2 = 10 x 30 = 300 minutes

Therefore, the correct answer is 300 minutes."
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 pieces per minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday, it has produced 6 x 12 = 72 pieces. And if it worked for 14 minutes today, it has produced 6 x 14 = 84 pieces. So, the total number of pieces produced by the machine is 72 + 84 = 156 pieces.
"Response:  If yesterday the machine produced 5 minutes worth of shirts, and today it produced 12 shirts in 5 minutes, then we can calculate that the total number of shirts produced today is:

$$ \text {Total shirts} = \frac{\text{Today's production time (in minutes)}}{\text{Yesterday's production time (in minutes)}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Total shirts} = \frac{12}{5} = 24 $$

Therefore, the machine has produced $24$ shirts today."
Response:  If they earned $165 in 5 days, that means they earned $33 per day. So, if they worked for one day, they would have earned $33.
Response:  If they earned $144 per day and were at the carnival for 22 days, then their total earnings would be:  Total earnings = Daily earnings x Number of days = $144 x 22 = $3,088.
Response:  We know that in 30 days they earned $420 with the game and $22 with the ring. So, we can write an equation: Game earnings = $420 x 30 = $12,600 Ring earnings = $22 + $420 = $442 Now, let's find out how much the game earned per day: Game daily earnings = $12,600 / 30 = $420 per day Similarly, we can find out how much the ring earned per day: Ring daily earnings = $442 / 30 = $147 per day Therefore, the game earned $420 per day and the ring earned $147 per day.
Response:  In the first 44 days, they earned $382 + $374 = $756.  In the remaining 10 days, they earned $X. So, the total amount of money they earned is $756 + X = $838.
Response:  In the first 20 days of the carnival, he earned $120 + $66 = $186. So, on any given day during those 20 days, he earned $9.3 ($186 / 20).
Response:  We know that they earned $325 in the first 154 days and $114 in the remaining 57 days. So, we can calculate their daily earnings as follows:  Daily Earnings = Total Earning / Number of Days  In this case, total earnings are $325 + $114 = $439. And number of days is 154 + 57 = 211 days. Therefore, their daily earnings are:  Daily Earnings = $439 / 211 days = $206 per day.
Response:  If Lucy went to the store and bought 10 packets of pencils, that means she bought 10 x 5 = 50 pencils.  And if she also bought 4 packages of cake, that means she bought 4 x 6 = 24 pieces of cake. So altogether, Lucy bought 50 + 24 = 74 items. Therefore, she bought 74 packets of pencils.
Response:  Paketov piškotkov = 4 Paketov torte = 22 Paketov čokolade = 16 Total number of packets = 4 + 22 + 16 = 42 packets.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packets of chips and some packages of cake. So she had a total of 27 packets of food. Since we know how many packets of chips she bought, we can subtract that from the total number of packets to find out how many packets of cake she bought. Therefore, the answer is 4 packets of cake.
Response:  We know that Lucy went to the store and bought 2 packages of candy and 12 packs of cookies. So far, she has spent $2 x 2 = $4 + $12 = $16. At the end, she had 56 pieces of candy left. Therefore, she must have bought $4 x 2 = $8 worth of candy. Since each package of candy contains 8 pieces, Lucy bought 8 x $8 = $64 worth of candy. Now let's calculate how many packages of candy she bought: $64 / $8 per package = 8 packages of candy.  Therefore, Lucy bought 8 packages of candy.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got into the bus at the next stop. So, the total number of people in the bus now is: 12 + 4 = 16. Since each bus can carry up to 36 passengers, we have exceeded the capacity of the bus and therefore, the correct answer is 16 people are currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were eight people in the bus. Then, twelve new passengers boarded and three of them got off. So, now there are... (8 + 12 - 3) = 23 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus (the initial number). Then, 9 more people got on the bus (the total number of new passengers). So, the final number of people in the bus is: 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people in the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 8 more people got on the train. So, the total number of people now on the train is: 11 + 8 = 19. Therefore, there are 19 people currently on the train.
Response:  We know that there were 22 teachers and 676 people in total. To find out how many students were on the program, we need to divide the number of people by the number of teachers. So, if there were 22 teachers and 676 people, then there were 30 people per teacher (676 / 22 = 30). Therefore, there were 30 students on the program.
Response:  We know that there are 73 stars (or teachers) and 724 students. So, if we multiply these two numbers together, we get: 73 x 724 = 5192. Therefore, there were 5192 people on the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students. To find out how many more students than parents, we can subtract the number of parents from the total number of students: 521 - 174 = 347. So, there were 347 more students than parents in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students participating in the program. If we divide the number of parents (61) by the total number of participants (177), we get a fraction: 61/177 = 0.35. Since this is not an integer, we round it up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 44 people present at the program. Therefore, the correct answer is 44.
Response:  If the pit is 919 feet deep and they have to walk 1307 feet away from it, then we can calculate how far the bottom of the pit is from where they are standing using the following formula: Distance = Depth + Walking distance. In this case, the distance would be: Distance = 919 + 1307 = 2226 feet. So, the end of the pit is 2226 feet away from where they started.
Response:  We know that Jama is deep 1218 feet and they are already at 849 feet. If they travel with a speed of 17 miles per hour, how far will they be from the end of the cave? To find this out we can use the formula distance = speed x time. In this case, the time it takes to reach the end of the cave would be: Time = Distance / Speed = 849 - 1218 / 17 = 50 hours So, it would take them 50 hours to reach the end of the cave if they continue traveling at a speed of 17 miles per hour.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is currently 659 meters and we want to find out how deep it will be until the end of the cave. To calculate this, we need to use the formula: Depth = Height - Initial Depth, where Height is the current height (659 meters) and Initial Depth is the initial depth of the cave (0 meters). So, if we plug these values into the formula, we get: Depth = 659 - 0 = 659 meters. Therefore, there are still 659 meters until the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that initially there were six golden fish in the pond and then four more were added (Paige raised eight golden fish). So, the total number of golden fish in the pond after adding new ones is: 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, ten golden fish are left in the pond.
Response:  We know that Paige has been taking care of 7 golden fish and 12 cats for 12 months. If each cat eats 3 fish per day, then the number of fish left after 1 month is: 7 x 3 = 21. So, there are 21 fish left after 1 month. Now, we need to calculate how many days have passed since Paige started taking care of the fish. According to the question, she has been doing it for 15 more days. Therefore, the total number of days Paige has taken care of the fish is: 15 + 12 = 27 days. Finally, we can calculate the number of fish left after 27 days as follows: 21 x (27 / 12) = 49 fish. So, there are 49 fish left in the pond after 27 days.
Response:  We know that Paige had raised 16 goldfish and 71 cats liked to eat them. So, if we subtract the number of cats (71) from the total number of fish (16), we get the remaining number of goldfish: 16 - 71 = -55. Therefore, there are -55 goldfish left.
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish in the pond and that wild cats ate 5 of them. So, we have:  Number of goldfish left = Total number of goldfish - Number eaten by cats  Number of goldfish left = 15 - 5  Number of goldfish left = 10 Therefore, there are 10 golden fish left in the pond.
"Response:  At first, he had 43 jabokcs and gave away 17 of them (since he said ""je ostal"" which means ""he left""). So now he has 43 - 17 = 26 jabokcs left. Then he took 2 more jabokcs from those remaining ones, so now he has 26 - 2 = 24 jabokcs left. Therefore, he used 24 jabokcs."
Response:  If he had 58 apples and ate 35, then he has 23 apples left.
Response:  If he had 40 apples and gave away 54 pieces of candy, then he has 40 - 54 = -14 left. But if he also ate some apples, then he has even fewer apples than that. So, he must have eaten at least 39 apples.
Response:  If Adam has 11 action figures to place on each of his four desks and he has 4 desks, then he will have a total of 11 x 4 = 44 action figures placed on his desks. However, since there are only 40 boxes available, some of the action figures may not fit on all of the desks. Therefore, the maximum number of action figures that can be placed on each desk is 40 / 11 = 3.6 (round down to nearest whole number). So, the total number of action figures that Adam can place on his desks is 44 / 3.6 = 12.
Response:  If Adam had placed 10 action figures on each of his shelves and he has 8 shelves in his room, then we can calculate the total number of shelves as follows: Total Number of Shelves = Number of Action Figures per Shelf x Number of Shelves = 10 x 8 = 80 So, Adam had 80 shelves in his room.
"Response:  If Adam can place 8 figurines and 10 marbles on each of his four shelves, then he has a total of:

8 x 4 = 32 figurines
10 x 4 = 40 marbles

So, altogether, Adam can hold 72 objects (32 + 40) on his four shelves."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 circles and each circle has 32 flowers inside it. So, in total, we have 
$$ \text {Number of circles} = 10 $$ 
$$ \text{Flowers in each circle} = 32 $$ 
Now, let's find out how many flowers there are in total: 
$$ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of circles} \times \text{Flowers in each circle} $$ 
So, the final answer is:  $ 544 \div 10 = 54 $ 
Therefore, there are 54 flowers in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 466 loncev and each lonc has 53 cvetova. So, the total number of cvetova is: 466 x 53 = 24980 cvetov. Similarly, we know that there are 181 palic in each lonc, so the total number of palic is: 466 x 181 = 8736 palic. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of cvetova = 24980; Number of palic = 8736."
Response:  We know that there are 141 lonci and each lon is divided into 71 cvetova and 91 palic. So we can write it as follows: 141 = 71 x + 91 y where x and y are integers. Now we need to find out what values of x and y satisfy this equation. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 3 and y = 20. Therefore, there are 3 x 71 = 213 cvetova and 20 x 91 = 1820 palic in total.
Response:  We have 40 flowers in each long (lon). So, we have 40 x 10 = 400 flowers in total. Therefore, there are 10 longs (lon) in all.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 pieces of gum. If we divide them into groups of equal size, then each group must contain at least one Skittle and one piece of gum. Therefore, the minimum number of groups is 4502 + 4276 = 8788. Since we cannot have fractional groups, the actual number of groups will be an integer between 8788 and 8790 (inclusive). So, the size of each group is 8790 / 154 = 57.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4950 pieces of gum. If we divide the Skittles into groups of size $x$, then the number of Skittles in each group is given by $\boxed{3941 \div x}$. Since there are 495 groups, the total number of Skittles in all groups is $\boxed{(3941 \div x) \times 495 = 178625}$. Therefore, the size of each group is $\boxed{178625 / 495 = 36}$.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and we want to divide them into groups of size $x$. So, we can write an equation based on this information: $\text{Total number of Skittles} = x \times \text{Number of groups}$.  Now, we have two pieces of information about the number of Skittles in each group:  The first piece of information is that there are 517 gumballs, which means that there are 517 - 3 (for the three gumballs that Steven has) = 514 gumballs left over after giving one to each of the five friends.  Therefore, the number of Skittles in each group is equal to the number of gumballs divided by the number of groups: $x = \frac{\text{Number of gumballs}}{\text{Number of groups}}$.  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: $x = \frac{514}{8} = 65$.  So, each group contains approximately 65 Skittles.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes.
Response:  If there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students, then we have:  Number of students = 304 x 75 = 22,500 students.
