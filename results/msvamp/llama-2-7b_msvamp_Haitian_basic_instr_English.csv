"Response: 35649875

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

Jerry has $100 in his pocket and he spends $2 every time he takes an action. He takes 10 actions in total.

To find out how much money Jerry has after taking all the actions, we need to calculate the amount of money he has at each step:

Step 1: Jerry has $100 in his pocket.
Step 2: Jerry spends $2, so now he has $100 - $2 = $98.
Step 3: Jerry spends $2 again, so now he has $98 - $2 = $96.
...
Step 10: Jerry spends $2 for the last time, so now he has $96 - $2 = $94.

Therefore, the final amount of money Jerry has is $94."

Explanation:
The problem states that there are 4 lots of 12 eggs each in one basket and 5 lots of 8 eggs each in another basket. To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to multiply the number of eggs in each lot by the number of lots. Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is:

4 x 12 = 48 (eggs in first basket)
5 x 8 = 40 (eggs in second basket)
Total number of eggs = 48 + 40 = 88
So, there are 88 eggs in both baskets."

Explanation:
The question asks how many cents Dean has after he gives 9 francs to Dlo and gets back 5 pounds from Ron. Since there are 100 francs in one Swiss franc (CHF), we can convert the amount of money that Dean gave to Dlo as follows:

9 CHF x 100 = 900 Francs

Now, we need to calculate the number of pounds that Dean received from Ron:

5 £ x 100 = 500 Pounds

Finally, we subtract the amount of money that Dean received from Ron from the total amount of money that he gave to Dlo:

900 - 500 = 400 Francs

Therefore, Dean has 400 francs left after giving 9 francs to Dlo and receiving 5 pounds from Ron."

Response:  The number of bonbons that Helen has is 270 + (31 x 419) = 1569 bonbons.
"Response: 3672

Explanation:
The question states that Helen has 90 chocolates and 51 resealable bags of chocolate. Additionally, she has 484 chocolates in total. To find out how many chocolates Helen has overall, we need to add up the number of chocolates in each bag and the number of individual chocolates. Therefore, the answer is 3672 (90 + 51 x 484 = 3672)."
"Response: 1039
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, Helen made 527 pieces of chocolate cake and 86 pieces of resin chocolate. If she sold each piece for $5, then the total amount of money she made from selling chocolate is: ($5 x 527) + ($5 x 86) = $2635 + $430 = $3065. Therefore, the number of boxes of chocolates that Helen sold is: $3065 / $50 = 61.3 (round to nearest whole number). So, Helen sold 61 boxes of chocolates."
Response: 265

"Response: 26458

Explanation:
The first part of the question ""si twou wòch la"" means ""if two watches"", and the second part ""se 919 pye fon e yo bezwen vwayaje"" means ""there are 919 pieces in each watch"". Therefore, we need to multiply the number of pieces in each watch by 2 to get the total number of pieces. Finally, we add the last part of the question ""lwen se fen twou wòch la"" which means ""and let's find out how many there are altogether"", so we add the total number of pieces from both watches together to get our final answer of 26458."
