Response:  On Monday (mandag), Julia played with 18 children.  On Tuesday (tirsdag), she played with 10 children. So, we can say that Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 8.
Response:  If Julia played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday, then she had 12 - 11 = 1 more child to play with on Tuesday than on Monday. So, Julia played with 1 more child on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  If Julia has 5 children on Monday (leg day), then she must have played with at least 10 other children on Tuesday (play day). So, in total, Julia played with 15 children (5 + 10 = 15).
Response:  On Monday (mandag), Julia played with 5 children.  On Tuesday (tirsdag), she played with 14 children. If she played with 16 children in total, then how many children did she play with on Monday?  Solution: We know that the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is equal to the number of children she played with on Tuesday minus the number of children she played with on Monday. So we can write an equation based on this information: Number of children Julia played with on Monday = Total number of children she played with - Number of children she played with on Tuesday Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Number of children Julia played with on Monday = 16 - 5 = 11 Therefore, Julia played with 11 children on Monday.
Response:  If Julia played tug of war with 16 children on Monday and she played with 12 more children than on Tuesday, then we can say that...
Response:  If Julia played tug of war with 14 children on Tuesday and she played more children than that on Monday, then we can say that Julia played with at least 20 children (Tuesday + Monday). So, the answer is 20.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday, she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday (onsdag), she played with only 2 children. So in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 33 children on those two days. Now, we are asked how many children she played with on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is 33.
Response:  On Monday (9 children), Tuesday (5 children) and Wednesday (15 children). So, Julia played with 9 + 5 = 14 children on those days.
Response:  On Monday (14 children), Tuesday (20 children) and Wednesday (16 children). So, Julia played with 14 + 20 = 34 children on those days.
Response:  On Monday (7 children), Tuesday (9 children) and Wednesday (96 children). So, we have to find out how many more children Julia had with her on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she had on Tuesday from the number of children she had on Monday:  Number of children Julia had with her on Monday - Number of children Julia had with her on Tuesday = 7 - 9 = 2 Therefore, Julia had 2 more children with her on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday, she played with 2 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 8 children. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday as follows:  Difference = Number of children played with on Wednesday - Number of children played with on Monday  Difference = 8 - 14  Difference = -6  Therefore, Julia played with 6 fewer children on Wednesday than she did on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (11 children), Tuesday (8 children) and Wednesday (9 children). So, we have to find out how many more children Julia had with Tirsdag than she did with Onsdag. We can do this by subtracting the number of children Julia had with Onsdag from the number of children she had with Tirsdag:  Number of children Julia had with Tirsdag - Number of children Julia had with Onsdag = 11 - 9 = 2 Therefore, Julia had 2 more children with Tirsdag than she did with Onsdag.
Response:  On Monday (legde), Julia had 15 children. On Tuesday (tirsdag), she had 18 children. And on Wednesday (onsdag), she had 7 children. So, we need to find out how many more children Julia had with Monday and Tuesday compared to Wednesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children Julia had on Wednesday from the number of children she had on Monday and Tuesday:  Number of children Julia had on Monday + Number of children Julia had on Tuesday - Number of children Julia had on Wednesday = 15 + 18 - 7 = 26 Therefore, Julia had 26 more children on Monday and Tuesday than she did on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday, she played with 10 children. On Wednesday (onsdag), she played with 15 children. So in total, Julia played with 13 + 10 = 23 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday, she played with 13 children. On Wednesday (onsdag), she played with 20 children. So in total, Julia played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 12 children for 10 hours (50% of 34 hours). So she played with 12 x 10 = 120 children on Monday.  On Tuesday, she played with 14 children for 10 hours (50% of 34 hours), so she played with 14 x 10 = 140 children on Tuesday. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 120 + 140 = 260 children.
Response:  On Monday (mandag), Julia played with 19 children. On Tuesday (tirsdag), she played with 18 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Mandag), Julia played with six children. On Tuesday (Tirsdag), she played with five children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 6 - 5 = 1 more child. Therefore, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. On Monday, she played with four children. So, the number of children she played with on Monday is 4. Now, we are asked how many children she played with on Tuesday. Since ""tirsdag"" means Tuesday in Danish, and Julia played with more than four children on that day, we can conclude that she played with at least five children on Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"Response:  On Wednesday (onsdag), Julia played with four children.  On Monday (mandag), she played with six children. So, we can write down:
Ononday = 4 children
Monday = 6 children
Now, let's subtract the number of children Julia played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Wednesday to find out how many more children she played with on Wednesday than on Monday:
Difference = 4 - 6 = -2
So, Julia played with two fewer children on Wednesday than she did on Monday."
"Response:  If Bobby spat out 25 more pieces of candy after eating some initially, that means he had x pieces of candy to start with. Since he spat out 25 more, we can write an equation:
x + 25 = 43
Now solve for x:
x = 18
So, Bobby started with 18 pieces of candy."
Response:  If Bobby spat 28 pieces of candy initially and then he ate 42 more, so in total he ate 70 pieces (28 + 42). And if he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate, then the total number of candies he ate is 70 + 63 = 133 pieces. Therefore, Bobby spat 133 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Bobby spat 33 pieces of candy and then he ate four more, that means he ate 37 pieces of candy in total (33 + 4 = 37). Additionally, if he ate 14 pieces of chocolate, that brings the total number of candies and chocolates to 51 (37 + 14 = 51). So, Bobby spat and ate a total of 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.
Response:  If Bobby spat out 38 pieces of gum and then spat out 36 more, that means he spat out a total of 74 pieces of gum (38 + 36).  Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. So, if he spat out more gum than he ate chocolate, then the number of pieces of chocolate he ate is equal to the difference between the number of pieces of gum he spat out and the number of pieces of chocolate he ate. In this case, that would be 74 - 16 = 58 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby spat out more gum than he ate chocolate.
Response:  If Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces, then he ate 18 more pieces than he initially had. So, if we let x be the number of candies Bobby initially had (i.e., x = 20), then we can say that he ate 18 more pieces, which means he ate a total of x + 18 = 34 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby had 20 + 18 = 38 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially. If he ate 5 pieces, then he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Then, he ate 9 more pieces, so now he has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had 22 pieces of candy initially and he ate some, then he had x pieces of candy left after eating some. Since he ate five more pieces of candy, he now has x + 5 pieces of candy left. Finally, if he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, Bobby started with 22 pieces of candy and ate 19 (22 - 3).
Response:  Bobby had 19 sweets and he ate two of them. So, how many sweets does he have left? We can use subtraction to find out!  Subtracting 2 from 19 gives us... (counting on fingers)...17! Yes, Bobby has 17 sweets left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, then he has 20 pieces left. So, if he ate x pieces of candy, then he must have started with 32 - x pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy that Bobby ate is equal to 20 - (32 - x).
Response:  If Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy and he ate 17 pieces, then he has eaten a total of 17 + 15 = 32 pieces of candy so far. So, he still has 36 - 32 = 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby has 23 pieces of candy and he eats 3, then he will have 23 - 3 = 20 pieces of candy left. So, Bobby has 20 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Alan took five balloons to the park and Jake took three balloons to the park, then we can say that Alan had five more balloons than Jake at the park. So, the difference between their number of balloons is five. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If Allan took one balloon and Jake took three balloons, then we can say that Jake had 3 - 1 = 2 more balloons than Allan in the park.
Response:  If Allan took two balloons with him to the park, then he has 2 - 2 = 0 balloons left at home. So Jake must have taken 0 + 1 = 1 balloon with him to the park.
Response:  If Jake took 6 balloons to the park and he took 4 more than Allan, then Allan took 6 - 4 = 2 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan took 5 balls to the park, and then Jake took 6 more than Allan, that means Jake took 6 + 5 = 11 balls to the park.
"Response: 
Allen took 3 balloons with him and Jake took 5 balloons with him to the park. So together they had 3 + 5 = 8 balloons at the park. Then Allen bought two more balloons in the park, so now he has 2 + 8 = 10 balloons. Therefore, Allan had 10 balloons and Jake had 5 balloons in the park."
"Response: 
Allan took one balloon and Jake took four balloons to the park. So, in total, they have five balloons (one from Allan + four from Jake).  Now, Allan bought three more balloons at the park. So, now there are eight balloons in total - seven from Jake and one from Allan. Therefore, Allan had two more balloons than Jake in the park."
"Response: 
Allan took three balloons with him and Jake took six balloons with him to the park. So, if we add up all the balloons that both of them had, it would be: 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, Jake had nine more balloons than Allan in the park."
"Response: 
Allan took five balloons to the park and Jake took four balloons to the park. So far, we have 5 + 4 = 9 balloons at the park. Then, Allan bought three more balloons while he was there. Therefore, the total number of balloons at the park is now 9 + 3 = 12 balloons."
"Response: 
Allan took 6 balloons to the park and Jake took 2 balloons to the park. So far, they have taken a total of 8 balloons (6 + 2) to the park.  Then, Jake bought three more balloons in the park. Now, the total number of balloons that Jake has is 3 + 2 = 5.  Therefore, Allan had more balloons than Jake at the park, by 8 - 5 = 3."
"Response: 
Allan took 6 balloons to the park and Jake took 3 balloons to the park. So far, they have taken a total of 9 balloons (6 + 3) to the park.  Then, Jake bought 4 more balloons in the park. Now, the total number of balloons that Jake has is 4 + 3 = 7 more than Allan. Therefore, Jake had 7 more balloons than Allan in the park."
"Response: 
Alan took five balloons to the park and Jake took six balloons to the park. Then, in the park, Jake bought three more balloons. So, how many balloons did Jake take with him to the park?  We can use the information given in the question to find out.  First, we know that Jake took six balloons to the park. Then, he bought three more balloons in the park, so now he has nine balloons (six + three = nine). Therefore, Jake took nine balloons with him to the park."
Response:  If Allan took 3 balls and 20 balloons to the park, then he had 3 + 20 = 23 objects in total. Similarly, if Jake took 5 balls and 59 balloons to the park, then he had 5 + 59 = 64 objects in total. So, Allan had 23 objects and Jake had 64 objects in the park.
Response:  If Allan took 7 balls and 5 bounces to the park, then he had 7 + 5 = 12 objects in total (balls plus bounces). Similarly, if Jake took 6 balls and 4 bounces to the park, then he had 6 + 4 = 10 objects in total (balls plus bounces). So, Allan had more objects than Jake in the park.
Response:  If Allan took 5 balloons to the park and then he and Jake together took 6 balloons, that means Jake took 1 additional balloon. So, Jake took 1 ballon with him to the park.
Response:  If Allan bought three balloons from the park and Jake took six balloons there, then we can say that Jake has taken six - three = three more balloons than Allan in the park. So, the correct answer is three.
Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and two hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours per day studying languages. So, he spends more time learning English than Chinese. Therefore, the difference in hours is 8 - 2 = 6 hours per day.
Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and seven hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day studying languages. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning English from the number of hours he spends learning Chinese: 13 - 6 = 7 hours. So, Ryan spends 7 more hours learning Chinese than English.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends x hours per day learning Chinese.  Since he spends 4 hours per day learning both languages together, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

So, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends seven hours per day learning English and some additional hours learning Chinese, then he spends x hours per day learning Chinese.  If he spends two more hours per day learning English than he does learning Chinese, then we can set up the equation:

7 + 2 = x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5

Therefore, Ryan spends five hours per day learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends five hours per day learning Chinese and some additional time learning English, then he spends x hours per day learning English. Since he spends two more hours learning English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5 + 2 = 7
Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English."
"Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and seven hours per day learning Chinese, then in five days he will have spent a total of:
6 x 5 = 30 hours on English
7 x 5 = 35 hours on Chinese
So, in total, Ryan will have spent 30 + 35 = 65 hours on both languages during those five days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and five hours per day learning Chinese, then in two days he will have spent a total of:
6 x 2 = 12 hours learning English
5 x 2 = 10 hours learning Chinese
So, if he learns for two days, he will spend 12 + 10 = 22 hours learning English and Chinese combined."
"Response:  If Ryan spends five hours per day learning English and four hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day he will spend:
5 + 4 = 9 hours learning English and Chinese combined.
If he learns for six days, then he will spend:
9 x 6 = 54 hours learning English and Chinese combined."
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends in total 10 hours (4 + 6) per day studying languages.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide the total time spent studying languages by 24 to get the number of hours per day: 10 hours / 24 hours = 0.417 hours/day (or approximately 41.7 minutes per day).
Response:  Ryan spends six hours per day learning English, seven hours per day learning Chinese, and three hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many hours he spends learning each language in total, we can multiply the number of days he spends learning each language by the number of hours he spends learning that language per day. For example, if he learns English for 30 days, he will have spent 6 x 30 = 180 hours learning English in total. Similarly, if he learns Chinese for 42 days, he will have spent 7 x 42 = 294 hours learning Chinese in total, and so on. Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 180 hours learning English, 294 hours learning Chinese, and 108 hours learning Spanish.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends six hours per day learning English, three hours per day learning Chinese, and 58 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends on learning English than on learning Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese from the total number of hours he spends on learning all three languages. So, let's do that:
Total hours spent on learning all three languages = 6 + 3 + 58 = 77 hours/day
Number of hours spent on learning Chinese = 3 hours/day
Now, let's subtract the number of hours spent on learning Chinese from the total number of hours spent on learning all three languages:
More hours spent on learning English than on learning Chinese = 77 - 3 = 74 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 74 more hours on learning English than on learning Chinese."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends seven hours per day learning English, two hours per day learning Chinese, and four hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent learning Spanish from the total time spent learning both languages. So, let's do that:
Total time spent learning both languages = 7 + 2 = 9 hours/day
Time spent learning Spanish = 4 hours/day
Now, let's subtract the time spent learning Spanish from the total time spent learning both languages:
More hours spent learning English than Spanish = Total time spent learning both languages - Time spent learning Spanish
= 9 - 4
= 5 hours/day
Therefore, Ryan spends five more hours learning English than he does learning Spanish."
Response:  We know that Ryan uses five hours per day to learn English and four hours per day to learn Spanish.  To find out how many more hours he uses to learn Chinese than he does to learn Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning Spanish from the number of hours he spends learning Chinese.  So, if Ryan learns Chinese for five hours per day and learns Spanish for four hours per day, then he uses five - four = one hour more per day to learn Chinese than he does to learn Spanish.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spends 2 hours per day learning English if he spends 1 hour less than before (3 - 1 = 2). So, he spends 2 hours per day learning Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends four hours per day learning English and five hours per day learning Chinese, he will spend a total of:
4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours learning English
5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours learning Chinese
Therefore, in total, Ryan will spend 63 hours (28 + 35) learning both English and Chinese."
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 bags of expired canned goods. The next day, she found 7 more bags worth of expired canned goods. So, in total, she had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of expired canned goods.
Response:  On Monday (Mandag), she had 7 bags of used clothes. The next day (Tirsdag), she found an additional 12 bags of clothes worth of donations. So, in total, she found 19 bags of clothes (7 + 12). Therefore, she found 12 more bags of clothes than on Monday.
Response:  We know that Tiffany had four jars of pickles on Monday and found more jars on Tuesday. If she had six jars in total, then we can say that she had x jars on Monday and x + 4 jars on Tuesday. Since she found more jars on Tuesday than on Monday, we can write an equation: x + 4 = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2. So Tiffany had two jars of pickles on Monday and found additional three jars on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, she had some jars filled with leftovers. If she found 4 more bags of leftovers the next day, that means she now has a total of 12 bags (8 from Monday + 4 new). So, she had 3 tasks full of leftovers on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Mandag), Tiffany had 10 boxes of collected cans. Then, she found three more boxes on Tuesday (Tirsdag) and seven more boxes on Wednesday (Onsdag). So, in total, Tiffany had 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 boxes of collected cans.
Response:  On Monday (Mandag), Tiffany collected 8 bags of used containers. The next day she found 10 more bags with containers inside them. So, in total, she found 8 + 10 = 18 bags of containers after Monday. Then, on the third day, she found 4 more bags with containers inside them. Therefore, the final number of bags that Tiffany found is 18 + 4 = 22 bags of containers.
Response:  On Monday, she had 3 boxes of collected jars. Then, on Tuesday, she found 7 bags of jars and 44 bottles. So, in total, she has 3 + 7 + 44 = 54 containers with jars. Therefore, she has 54 poses (boxes) of jars in all.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red berries and 16 green berries in the basket. To find out how many more red berries than green berries there are, we can subtract the number of green berries from the number of red berries: 17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red berry than green berry in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red berries and 11 green berries in the basket. To find out how many more green berries than red berries there are, we can subtract the number of red berries from the total number of berries:  5 (red) + 11 (green) = 16  So, there are 16 - 5 = 11 more green berries than red berries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red berries and some green ones in the basket. If there are 15 total berries in the basket, then we can assume that the number of green berries is equal to the number of red berries minus 10 (since there are already 10 red berries). So, if there are 15 berries in the basket, then there must be 5 green berries in the basket (since 10 + 5 = 15).
Response:  We know that there are three red berries and some green berries in the basket. If there are more than ten green berries than red berries in the basket, then we can say that there must be at least 10 + x green berries where x is the number of red berries (3). So, the total number of green berries in the basket is 10 + x = 10 + 3 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 green berries in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red freshmen, 15 yellow freshmen, and 8 green freshmen in the basket. So, we can write this as follows:

Red freshmen = 7
Yellow freshmen = 15
Green freshmen = 8
Now, let's count the total number of freshmen in the basket:
Total freshmen = Red + Yellow + Green = 7 + 15 + 8 = 20
Therefore, there are 20 freshmen in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 7 red freshmen, 71 yellow freshmen and 8 green freshmen in the curve. To find out how many more green freshmen than red freshmen are in the curve, we need to subtract the number of red freshmen from the total number of freshmen. So, the answer is:  Number of green freshmen - Number of red freshmen = 8 - 7 = 1. Therefore, there are one more green freshman than red freshman in the curve.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 green freshener in the basket and 6 yellow freshener in the basket. So, we have a total of 20 freshener in the basket. Now, let's find out how many more green than yellow there are in the basket. According to the question, ""there are x more green than yellow"". Since there are 6 yellow freshener and 14 green freshener, if x is greater than 6 then there will be more green than yellow in the basket. Therefore, the answer is x = 10 (more green than yellow)."
Response:  We know that there are 19 red berries in the basket and 11 yellow berries. To find out how many more red berries than yellow berries there are, we need to subtract the number of yellow berries from the total number of berries. So, the difference between the number of red berries and yellow berries is:  19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more red berries than yellow berries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red freshmen in the basket and 90 green freshmen. So, we can write this as follows: 6R + 90G = Total number of freshmen in the basket. Now, we also know that there are 16 green freshmen in the basket. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows: 6R + 90G + 16 = Total number of freshmen in the basket. Simplifying the equation, we get: 72 = Total number of freshmen in the basket. Therefore, there are 72 freshmen in the basket - 6 red and 64 green.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red berries in the basket and 14 yellow berries in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation:

Red berries = 18
Yellow berries = 14

Now, let's find out how many green berries are in the basket. According to the question, there are 17 green berries in the basket. Therefore, we can add this value to our equations:

Red berries + Yellow berries + Green berries = Total number of berries

So, we have:

Red berries + Yellow berries + Green berries = 18 + 14 + 17 = 59

Therefore, there are 59 berries in total - 30 red berries, 14 yellow berries, and 17 green berries."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red berries in the basket and 14 green berries. So, we can write this as follows: 5R + 14G = x (where R represents red berries and G represents green berries). Now, we also know that there are 6 yellow berries in the basket. So, we can add them to our equation: 5R + 14G + 6Y = x. Can you solve for x now?
Response:  We know that there are 65 curves with fresh berries. Since each curve has either red or green berries, we can say that the total number of red berries is equal to 65 x 7 = 455 red berries. Similarly, the total number of green berries is equal to 65 x 3 = 195 green berries. Therefore, the total number of berries in each curve is 455 + 195 = 650 berries. So, there are 650 berries in each curve.
Response:  There are 11 curves with fresh berries. Each curve has 10 red berries and 18 green berries. So, in total, there are 10 x 11 = 110 red berries and 18 x 11 = 208 green berries. Therefore, there are 110 + 208 = 318 berries in all the curves combined.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 curves with fresh berries. Each curve has 16 red berries and 18 green berries. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:
Red Berries = 16 x 6 = 96 Green Berries = 18 x 6 = 108 Total Berries = Red + Green = 96 + 108 = 204 Now, we want to find out how many red berries there are in total. To do this, we divide the number of red berries by the total number of berries: Red Berries / Total Berries = 96 / 204 = 0.47 or approximately 47% of the total berries are red. Therefore, there are 47% of 6 = 2.88 red berries in each curve."
Response:  There are 7 curves with fresh berries. Each curve has 10 red berries and 2 green berries. So, in total there are 7 x 10 = 70 red berries and 7 x 2 = 14 green berries. Therefore, there are 14 green berries in the curves.
Response:  We know that there are 7 ferns in all curves. Since each curve has 4 red ferns and 3 green ferns, we can write this as: 4R + 3G = 7 (1) where R is the number of red ferns and G is the number of green ferns. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: 4(4) + 3(3) = 7 (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: 16 + 9 = 7 (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: 25 = 7 (4) Therefore, there are 3 curves.
Response:  There are two curves with fresh berries. Each curve has 4 red berries and some green berries. If there are 12 berries in all curves combined, how many green berries are there in each curve?  We can start by using the information that there are 4 red berries in each curve. So, if we divide the total number of berries (12) by the number of red berries (4), we get the number of green berries in each curve: Number of green berries = Total berries / Number of red berries = 12 / 4 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 green berries in each curve.
Response:  We know that there are 16 fresh fruit in total and 13 of them are red. So, we can conclude that the number of green ones is equal to the number of red ones minus 13. Therefore, the number of green fruits in the bowl is 16 - 13 = 3.
Response:  We know that each curved has 19 red beads and 4 green beads. If there are 15 curves, then we can calculate how many beads are in total as follows: Number of red beads = 19 x 15 = 285 Number of green beads = 4 x 15 = 60 Therefore, there are 285 red beads and 60 green beads in all 15 curves combined.
Response:  We know that there are 10 ferns in total and they are distributed equally among some curves. Since each curve has either 4 red or 6 green ferns, we can say that the number of curves with red ferns is equal to the number of curves with green ferns. Therefore, the number of curves with ferns is 4 + 6 = 10. So, there are 10 curves with ferns.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green freshener bags in total and each bag contains 60 gul...
"Response:  If Jerry had four action figures on his shelf initially and then added more later, we can represent this as follows:
Jerry's initial collection of action figures = 4
New action figures added to the collection = x
So, in total, Jerry has x + 4 action figures on his shelf. To find out how many new action figures Jerry added, we need to subtract the number of original action figures from the total number of action figures he has now:
x + 4 = 8 (total number of action figures)
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:
x = 4
Therefore, Jerry added 4 new action figures to his collection."
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, if there are now 10 action figures on his shelf in total, how many did he originally have on the shelf? We can use algebra to solve this problem as follows: Let x be the number of action figures Jerry had on his shelf initially. Since he later added 7 more action figures, we can write: x + 7 = 10 (total number of action figures) Now, we need to isolate the variable x. To do that, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7 Solving for x, we get: x = 3 So, Jerry originally had 3 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had four action figures and 22 books on a shelf in his room initially. Later, he added six more action figures to the shelf. So, how many action figures did Jerry have on the shelf after adding the new ones?  We can use multiplication to solve this problem. If Jerry had four action figures initially and then added six more, he now has 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  Jerry had five action figures and nine books on his shelf initially. Later, he added seven more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, how many action figures were there after Jerry added the new ones?  We know that the initial number of action figures was five, plus the new ones he added later is seven, so the total number of action figures now is five + seven = twelve.  Therefore, there are twelve action figures on Jerry's shelf after he added the new ones.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 10 + 2 = 12 items on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had eight action figures and nine books on a shelf in his room initially. Later, he added ten more books to the shelf. So, how many books did he have on the shelf after adding the new ones?  We can use multiplication to solve this problem. If he had eight action figures initially and each figure takes up one space on the shelf, then he had 8 x 9 = 72 spaces available on the shelf for books. Since he added ten new books, he now has 72 + 10 = 82 books on the shelf. Therefore, Jerry had 82 books on the shelf after adding the new ones.
"Response:  Jerry had seven action figures and two books on his shelf initially. Later, he added four more books to the shelf. So, in total, there were:
7 (action figures) + 2 (books) = 9 items on Jerry's shelf initially.
When he added four more books later, the total number of items on his shelf became:
9 (initially) + 4 (new books) = 13 items on Jerry's shelf after adding new books."
Response:  Jerry had five action figures and two books on a shelf in his room earlier. Later, he added nine more books to the shelf. So, initially there were 5 + 2 = 7 items on the shelf. After adding 9 more books, the total number of items on the shelf is now 7 + 9 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 books on Jerry's shelf.
"Response:  Jerry had eight action figures on a shelf in his room initially. Later, he added four new action figures to the shelf and removed five old ones. So, how many action figures did Jerry have on the shelf after these changes?

Step 1: Initially, Jerry had 8 action figures on the shelf.

Step 2: He added 4 new action figures, so now he has 8 + 4 = 12 action figures on the shelf.

Step 3: Then, he removed 5 old action figures, leaving him with 12 - 5 = 7 action figures on the shelf.

Therefore, Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf after the changes were made."
Response:  If Jerry had three action figures on his shelf initially and then added four more later, that means he has a total of seven action figures now (3 + 4 = 7). So, if he removed some of the old action figures from the shelf, there would be six action figures left on the shelf (7 - X) where X is the number of action figures he removed. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
Response:  Jerry had seven action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added more action figures to the shelf and removed ten of the old ones. If there are eight action figures on his shelf now, that means Jerry has added x new action figures to the shelf. Since he removed ten of the old ones, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 8. Solving for x gives us: x = 5. So, Jerry has added five new action figures to his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added two new action figures and removed seven of the old ones. So, how many action figures does Jerry have now if there are ten on his shelf in total?  We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let X be the number of action figures Jerry had originally on his shelf. Then, we know that after adding two new action figures, the total number of action figures is X + 2. And after removing seven old action figures, the remaining number of action figures is X - 7. Now, let's equate these two expressions: X + 2 = 10... (1) X - 7 = X... (2) Subtracting (1) from (2), we get: 2 = X - 7 Solving for X, we find that Jerry had initially 3 action figures on his shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  Jerry had nine action figures on his shelf initially. If he added seven more action figures later, then there are now 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total on the shelf. Similarly, if he also has 10 books on the shelf, then there were originally 10 - 9 = 1 books on the shelf for every 9 action figures. So, the number of action figures is 16 / 9 = 1.8 action figures per book. Therefore, there are 10 books on the shelf and 1.8 x 10 = 18 action figures on the shelf in total.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures initially. Later, he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 3 + 2 = 5 action figures on his shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is 5.
Response:  Jerry had seven books and three action figures on a shelf in his room earlier. Later, he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, how many more books than action figures were there on his shelf initially?  Books = 7 Action Figures = 3 + 2 = 5 Therefore, there were five more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf initially.
Response:  If there are six birds on the fence and more birds join them, then there will be a total of... (use mathematical operations to solve)...birds on the fence. So, the answer is 6 + x = where x is the number of additional birds that joined them.
Response:  If there were some birds on the fence and then four more birds came to them, that means there are now five birds in total - including both the ones already on the fence and the new ones that arrived. So, the correct answer is 5.
Response:  We know that there are 46 chickens and 6 ducks on the fence. To find out how many birds sit on the fence, we need to add the number of chickens and ducks together. So, the total number of birds sitting on the fence is 46 + 6 = 52 birds.
"Response:  We know that five more birds came to join the two ducks and the two storks already sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have:
2 ducks + 2 storks = 4 birds already on the fence.
Plus, 5 more birds came to join them, so the total number of birds on the fence is:
4 (already there) + 5 (newly arrived) = 9 birds on the fence."
Response:  We have 2 ravens and 4 crows sitting on the fence. Two more birds come to join them. How many more birds are there than crows sitting on the fence?  Solution: Ravens = 2 Crows = 4 Total number of birds = 2 + 2 = 4 So, there are 4 more birds than crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that three birds came to the fence and four large crows sat on it. So far, we have 3 + 4 = 7 creatures sitting on the fence. However, we were asked how many more crows than birds are sitting on the fence. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of birds from the total number of creatures, which gives us 7 - 3 = 4 additional crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 6 chickens and 2 crows sitting on the fence. If we assume that each crow sits next to one of the chickens, then there are 3 chickens left without a crow (since 2 crows already sat down). So, in total, there are 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence initially. Then, 6 storks come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 6 = 9 creatures sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more storks came to join them. So, in total, we have: 6 birds + 2 storks = 8 creatures sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 4 large birds (fugle) sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more large birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 4 + 6 = 10 large birds (storke) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds and eight storks coming to the nest. So, if we assume that each bird takes up one perch space (which is not necessarily true), then there will be 4 + 8 = 12 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have five birds (fugle) and four crows (storke). If we assume that each bird sits on one nest, then there will be five nests occupied by birds. However, if we consider that some of the birds may sit on multiple nests, then the number of nests occupied by birds could be higher than five. Therefore, the correct answer is more than five.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 6 storks initially sitting on the fence. Now, we are told that 2 more storks came to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds and 6 + 2 = 8 storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 5 birds and 8 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds coming to join the three storks already sitting on the fence. So, in total we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 crows and 2 birds on the fence. Then 3 more birds came. So, now we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds on the fence. But what about the crows? There are still 6 of them. Therefore, the total number of creatures sitting on the fence is 9 (birds) + 6 (crows) = 15.
Response:  We have 6 storks and 2 birds already sitting on the fence. If we add 3 more storks, then there will be a total of 9 birds (including the two existing ones) and 8 storks (including the six existing ones). So, in total, there are 9 + 8 = 17 creatures sitting on the fence.
Response:  The first chapter is 48 pages long, and the second chapter is 11 pages long. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the two chapters is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter is 37 pages long. The second chapter is 80 pages long, which means it is longer than the first chapter. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter, we can subtract the length of the first chapter from the length of the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, the second chapter has 43 pages more than the first chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book. The first chapter is 60 pages long, so it has x pages. Since there are 93 pages in total, we can write an equation: 60 + y = 93 where y is the number of pages in the second chapter. Now we need to solve for y. Can you do that?
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book. The second chapter is 36 pages long, so the total number of pages in both chapters is: 2 x 36 = 72 pages. Since there are 67 pages in the book, we can deduce that the first chapter has 15 pages (67 - 72).
"Response:  The first chapter is 66 pages long, so it has x + 66 pages. Since there are three chapters in total, each with a different number of pages, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 66 = 3(y + 35)
where y represents the number of pages in the second chapter and z represents the number of pages in the third chapter. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
x + 66 = 3(y + 35)
= 3(35 + 24)
= 3(59)
= 177
Therefore, the book has 177 pages in total."
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter is 91 pages long, while the second chapter is 23 pages long. Therefore, if we subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in all three chapters, we get: Total pages = 91 + 23 + 25 = 149 pages. So, the first chapter has more than 100 pages compared to the second chapter (149 - 23 = 126).
Response:  First chapter is 35 pages long, second chapter is 18 pages long, and third chapter is 3 pages long. To find out how many pages more the second chapter has than the third chapter, we can subtract their lengths: 18 - 3 = 15 pages. So, the second chapter has 15 pages more than the third chapter.
Response:  The first chapter is 53 pages long, the second chapter is 75 pages long, and the third chapter is 21 pages long. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 53 - 21 = 32 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that each chapter has 61 pages long and there are 31 chapters in total. So, we can calculate the number of pages as follows: Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Length of each chapter In this case, the number of pages would be: Number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages Therefore, the book has 1931 pages in total.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in total and each chapter has 23 pages. So, if we divide the number of pages by the number of chapters, we get: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 23 / 2 = 11 pages per chapter. Since the first chapter is 10 pages long, we can conclude that there are 10 + 11 = 21 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book with a total of 81 pages. The second chapter is 68 pages long, so we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter Number of pages in second chapter = 81 - 23 = 58 pages Therefore, there are 58 pages in the second chapter of the book.
"Response:  We know that 62 people went out to row in the morning and 39 people went out to row in the afternoon. So, we have:

Morning: 62 people x number of rows =...
Afternoon: 39 people x number of rows =...
We want to find out how many more rows were done in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of rows done in the afternoon from the number of rows done in the morning:

Number of more rows in the morning = Morning - Afternoon =...
So, there were more rows done in the morning than in the afternoon by... people."
Response:  We know that 52 people went fishing in the morning and 61 people went fishing in the afternoon. To find out how many more people went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of people who went fishing in the morning from the number of people who went fishing in the afternoon: 61 - 52 = 9 Therefore, there were 9 more people who went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  If 15 people went out to row in the morning and more than half of them (based on the information provided) went again in the afternoon, then we can assume that around 9-10 people went for a second time in the afternoon. So, if 32 people participated in total during the day, then the number of people who went in the afternoon is 9 or 10.
"Response:  If 8 camper went out in the morning and 7 campers went out in the afternoon, then the total number of campers that went out during the day is:

8 + 7 = 15

So, if 60 campers went out to roam that day, then the proportion of campers who went out in the morning is:

15/60 = 0.25 or 25%

Therefore, 25% of the campers went out in the morning."
Response:  We know that there were 36 matches in the morning, 13 in the afternoon, and 49 in the evening. So, we have to add these numbers together to find out how many matches there were altogether. Therefore, the total number of matches is: 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 matches.
Response:  We know that there were 44 players who went to bed early and woke up in the morning.  Then we have 39 players who went to bed late and woke up in the afternoon. Finally, we have 31 players who went to bed very late and woke up in the evening. So, if we subtract the number of players who went to bed late and woke up in the afternoon from the total number of players who went to bed early and woke up in the morning, we get the difference between the two groups. Therefore, the answer is: 44 - (39 + 31) = 23 more players went to bed early than went to bed late.
Response:  We know that there were 53 matches played in the morning, 48 matches played in the afternoon and 49 matches played in the evening. To find out how many more matches were played in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of matches played in the evening from the number of matches played in the morning. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  53 - 49 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 more matches played in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 33 people went for a morning walk and 34 people went for an afternoon walk. To find out how many more people went for a walk in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of people who went for a walk in the morning from the number of people who went for a walk in the afternoon:  34 - 33 = 1 Therefore, there were 1 more person who went for a walk in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went fishing and 59 campers went for a walk in the morning. In addition, 21 leaders went out to row in the afternoon. So, we have a total of: 13 + 59 = 72 campers who went out during the daytime hours (morning and afternoon).
"Response:  We know that 29 players went fishing in the morning and 66 players went for a walk around noon. To find out how many more players went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of players who went for a walk in the morning from the total number of players who went fishing. So, let's do that:

Total number of players who went fishing = 29 + 66 = 95

Now, we can see that there are 95 players who went fishing in total, but only 66 players went for a walk around noon. Therefore, the difference between the number of players who went fishing in the morning and those who went for a walk is:

Difference = Total number of players who went fishing - Number of players who went for a walk = 95 - 66 = 29

So, there were 29 more players who went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that 41 people went out and cleaned in the morning, so they are not included in the count of those who went for a walk or rowing. Therefore, we have to subtract them from the total number of people who went for a walk or rowing. So, the number of people who went for a walk or rowing is equal to 4 - (41).  Now, let's calculate it: 4 - (41) = -37.  Therefore, there were 37 people who went for a walk or rowing in total.
Response:  We know that 43 people went out to sea in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, we can say that there are x number of people who went out to sea in the afternoon. Since there were already 43 people out at sea in the morning, the total number of people out at sea is equal to 43 + x. Therefore, the number of camps out at sea in the afternoon is equal to x.
Response:  If Rachel picked 3 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples on the tree, then after she picked them, there would be 4 apples left on the tree (7 - 3 = 4). So, there are still 4 apples on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel had 4 apples in the beginning and she picked some of them. Now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, we can say that Rachel picked x apples where x is the difference between the number of apples she started with (4) and the number of apples left after picking (2). Therefore, Rachel picked 2 apples.
Response:  If Rachel picked seven mature apples from her tree and now the tree has five apples left, then we can assume that three of them are still mature (since they were not picked). So, there are two unripe apples remaining on the tree. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Rachel picked mature apples from her tree and now the tree has seven apples left, then six of them must be mature because she picked some. So, initially, the tree had 7 - 6 = 1 mature apple.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked six apples from her tree. Now, we see that the tree has two mature apples and four immature apples. So, if Rachel picked six apples, then she must have left three unpicked (immature) apples on the tree. Therefore, the number of apples the tree had when Rachel started picking them is equal to the number of unpicked apples plus the number of picked apples, which is 3 + 6 = 9. So, the tree had nine apples when Rachel started picking them.
Response:  Rachel picked three mature apples from her tree. Now the tree has two mature apples and 27 unripe apples. To begin with, the tree had x mature apples. Since Rachel picked 3 mature apples, we can set up the equation:  x - 3 = 2. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, the tree had 5 mature apples to begin with.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked seven apples from her tree and then two new apples grew on the tree. So far, we have nine apples (seven + two). Now, the statement says that the tree still has six apples on it. Therefore, the total number of apples that the tree had at the beginning was six + nine = fifteen.
Response:  Rachel had two apples on her tree initially. She picked four apples from the tree and then three new apples grew on the tree. So, there are now seven apples on the tree (2 + 4 - 3 = 7).
Response:  If Rachel had 52 apple trees and she picked two apples from one of them, then she has 52 - 2 = 50 apple trees left. Now, if she took seven apples from one of these remaining trees, then that tree would have seven apples left. So, in total, Rachel had 50 apple trees with seven apples each, which means she had 350 apples (50 x 7).
Response:  If Rachel had three apple trees and she picked 8 apples from each tree, then she picked a total of 24 apples (3 x 8 = 24). Now, if there were originally X apples on all the trees in the beginning, then after Rachel picked the apples, there are now X - 24 apples left on the trees. So, the answer is X = 72 apples (3 x 24 = 72).
Response:  If Rachel picked 7 apples from each of her four apple trees, then she picked a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. So, there are 28 - 7 = 21 apples left on the trees after she picked some.
Response:  We know that Ed had 20 more marbles than Doug initially. So, if Doug had x marbles initially, then Ed had 20 + x marbles initially.  Now, we are told that Doug lost some of his marbles on the playground. Let's say he lost y marbles. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:  Number of marbles Ed has = Number of marbles Doug has + Number of marbles Doug lost  Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:  Number of marbles Ed has = Number of marbles Doug has + Number of marbles Doug lost  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of marbles Ed has = 20 + x - y  Now, we want to find out how many marbles Doug lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug had at first (x) from the total number of marbles he had before losing any (20 + x):  Number of marbles Doug lost = 20 + x - x = 19  Therefore, Doug lost 19 marbles.
Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug initially. So if Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, then Ed had 10 + 10 = 20 marbles in total.  Now we are told that Doug lost 11 of his marbles on the playground. So, Doug now has 39 - 11 = 28 marbles left.  Therefore, Ed has 20 - 11 = 9 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had more than seven balls at first and lost some of them in the game. So he must have had exactly seven fewer balls than Doug. Therefore, if Ed has 22 balls now, then Doug must have had 29 balls initially (7 + 22 = 29).
Response:  We know that Ed had five more balls than Doug. So, if Ed had 27 balls, then Doug must have had 27 - 5 = 22 balls.
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more balls than Doug. So if Doug had x balls, then Ed had x + 24 balls.  Now we are told that Doug lost 27 of his balls on the playground while Ed found 9 more balls. So the total number of balls that Doug had is now x - 27. Similarly, the total number of balls that Ed had is (x + 24) - 9 = x + 15. Therefore, Ed had 15 more balls than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more balls than Doug. If Ed lost 17 of his balls on the playground, then he has fewer balls now than he did before. So, the difference between the number of balls Ed had and the number of balls Doug had is equal to the number of balls Ed lost. Therefore, the answer is: Ed had 12 more balls than Doug (29 - 17 = 12).
"Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more balls than Doug. So if Ed had x balls and Doug had y balls, then we can write an equation:
x = 19 + y
Now, we are told that Ed lost some of his balls at the playground. Let's say he lost x balls. Then we have two equations:
x = 19 + y
x - x = y - (lost balls)
Solving for the value of ""lost balls"", we get:
lost balls = x - (19 + y)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
lost balls = 8
So Ed lost 8 balls."
Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug. If Ed lost 21 of his marbles at the park, then he has fewer marbles left now. So, let's subtract 21 from the number of marbles Ed initially had to find out how many marbles he has left. According to the problem statement, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, which means that if we subtract 21 from Doug's initial number of marbles (which is not given in the problem), we will get Ed's remaining marbles. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles Ed and Doug had is equal to the number of marbles Ed had minus the number of marbles Doug had before they both went to the park. Now, we are told that Ed had 91 marbles initially, while Doug had fewer marbles. So, if we subtract the number of marbles Doug had from Ed's initial number of marbles, we should be able to determine the exact number of marbles Ed had after losing some at the park. Thus, the correct answer is: Ed had 60 marbles left after losing 21 at the park (i.e., 91 - 21 = 60).
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more balls than Doug initially. So if Ed had 17 balls now and lost 20 of them, then he must have started with 17 - 20 = 5 balls less than Doug. Therefore, Doug has 12 + 5 = 17 balls.
"Response:  If 408 students suggested potato soup and 42 students suggested bacon, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested potato soup = 408
Total number of students who suggested bacon = 42

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested potato soup than those who suggested bacon:

Number of students who suggested potato soup minus number of students who suggested bacon = (408 - 42) = 366

Therefore, there were 366 more students who suggested potato soup than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  If 479 students suggested potato soup and 489 students suggested bacon, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested bacon = 489
Total number of students who suggested potato soup = 479

Now, to find out how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested potato soup, we can use the following formula:

Number of students who suggested bacon - Number of students who suggested potato soup

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

(489) - (479) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested potato soup."
Response:  We know that out of 310 students, 185 suggested potato dumplings while others suggested bacon on the menu. So, we can say that 185 + x = 310, where x is the number of students who suggested bacon. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Substituting x = 185 in the equation above, we get 185 + x = 310. Solving for x, we get x = 125. Therefore, 125 students suggested bacon on the menu.
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, which means that 14 students did not suggest adding bacon.  Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding kartoffelmos is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who suggested adding bacon, i.e., 288 - 14 = 274. So, 274 students suggested adding kartoffelmos to the menu.
"Response:  If there are 457 students in total, and 63 more students suggested kartoffelmos than those who suggested bacon, then the number of students who suggested bacon is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ students\ who\ suggested\ bacon = 457 - 63 = 394 $$"
"Response:  We know that 182 students suggested adding potato mash to the menu, while 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding potato mash. So, if X is the number of students who suggested adding bacon, we can write an equation as follows:
X - 182 = (166 + 182) / 2
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 348
Therefore, 348 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
Response:  We know that there were 324 students who suggested potato dumplings, 374 students who suggested bacon, and 128 students who suggested tomatoes. So in total, we have: 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students who participated in suggesting food items.
"Response:  We know that out of 257 students, 120 suggested bacon and 97 suggested tomatoes. So, we have:

Bacon - 120
Tomatoes - 97
Kartoffelmos -?

We are asked to find out how many more students suggested kartoffelmos than those who suggested bacon. To do this, we can subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who suggested something other than kartoffelmos:

Total (other than kartoffelmos) - Bacon = Kartoffelmos

So, let's substitute the values we know into the equation:

Total (other than kartoffelmos) - 120 = Kartoffelmos

Now, we can solve for ""Kartoffelmos"" :

Kartoffelmos = Total (other than kartoffelmos) - 120
= 257 - 120
= 137

Therefore, 137 more students suggested kartoffelmos than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  We know that out of 144 students, 467 students suggested bacon and 79 students suggested tomatoes. So, we have:

Number of students who suggested kartoffelmos = Total number of students - Number of students who suggested bacon - Number of students who suggested tomatoes
= 144 - 467 + 79
= -328

Therefore, more students suggested kartoffelmos than those who suggested tomaters."
Response:  We know that out of 228 students, 337 students suggested bacon and 23 students suggested tomatoes. So, we have: Bacon - 337 Tomato - 23 Now, let's find out how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes: Bacon (total) - Tomato (total) = 337 - 23 = 314 Therefore, there are 314 more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes.
Response:  We know that out of 450 students, 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the remaining 412 did not participate in suggesting new food items. So, we can conclude that 38 + (412 - 450) = 70 students participated in suggesting new food items.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potato mash and bacon to the menu, and 351 students suggested only adding bacon to the menu, then we have a total of 579 suggestions (218 + 351). Therefore, the number of students who foresaw adding bacon to the menu is 351.
Response:  We know that there were 269 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu and 330 students who suggested adding potato dumplings. So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested adding potato dumplings (269 > 330).  Now, we also know that 76 students suggested adding tomatoes to the menu. Since this is a smaller number than both the number of students who suggested adding bacon (269) and the number of students who suggested adding potato dumplings (330), it can be concluded that more students suggested adding potato dumplings than either adding bacon or adding tomatoes (330 > 76 > 269).
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333 Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys at this school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:  Number of boys = 841 - 34 = 796  Therefore, there are 796 more boys than girls at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school.  Of those, 232 are girls and the remaining are boys. So, to find out how many boys there are, we can use the following equation: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Therefore, the number of boys at this school is: Number of boys = 485 - 232 = 253 boys.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys, then the number of boys must be less than 697.  Therefore, the number of boys is 469 (697 - 228 = 469).
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls, then the number of boys is 635 + 510 = 1145. Therefore, there are 1145 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 587 boys in school, then the total number of students is 868 + 587 = 1455. Since more than half of the students (281) are girls, we can say that at least half of the remaining students must be boys. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is greater than or equal to 281 / 2 = 140. So, there are between 140 and 1455 students in the school.
Response:  If there are 700 students in total and 142 more boys than girls, then the number of girls is 700 - 142 = 558. So, there are 558 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are initially 706 girls and 222 boys in the school.  If 418 girls join the school, then the total number of girls in the school is now 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Similarly, if 418 boys do not join the school, then the total number of boys in the school remains unchanged at 222. Therefore, the total number of students in the school now is 1124 + 222 = 1346 students.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 girls joined the school. To find out how many girls are left after they join, we need to subtract the number of girls who joined from the total number of girls initially present. So, the number of girls remaining = Initially there were 902 girls - Number of girls who joined (44) = 902 - 44 = 858 girls. Therefore, there are 858 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in school initially. Then, 465 girls joined the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys who joined from the total number of girls who joined:  Number of girls who joined = 465 So, the difference between the number of girls and boys is:  Difference = Number of girls - Number of boys = 465 - 410 = 55 Therefore, there are 55 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. If 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school, then the number of girls in the school increased by 682 - 732 = -$50. So, now there are $50 fewer girls than boys in the school. Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 761 - 50 = 711 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 214 boys in the school initially and 496 girls join the school later. So, the total number of students in the school now is:  Number of boys = 214 + (Number of girls / 2) = 214 + (496 / 2) = 214 + 248 = 462 boys. Therefore, there are 462 boys in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls in school and 318 boys. Therefore, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 36 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of teachers to students is 36/626 = 1/17.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. So, the ratio of students to teachers is 624 / 772 = 0.83. Therefore, approximately 83% of the people in the school are students, while 17% (or 772/624) are teachers.
Response:  If there are 402 girls and 739 students in total, then the number of boys is equal to 739 - 402 = 337. Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys at school and there are 692 students in total, then the number of boys is equal to 692 - 458 = 234. Therefore, there are 234 boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in school initially. Then, 403 girls joined the school later. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls who joined the school: Number of girls = Initially + Joined = 257 + 403 = 660 Therefore, there are 660 girls more than boys at the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and used $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Edward now has $2.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $13. Then he used some money, so now he has $10 (since he had $13 and spent some). Finally, he has $3 left, which means that he spent $7 ($13 - $6 = $7). Therefore, Edward brugte $7.
"Response:  If Edward had $9 initially and spent $8 more than that, then he has $17 now. So, to find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we can set up an equation using the information given in the question:

$9 + ($8 - $8) = $17

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$9 + $0 = $17

Solving for $9, we get:

$9 = $17

Therefore, Edward had $8 dollars before he spent any money."
Response:  Before he spent his money, Edward had $16 - ($92 x 9) = $16 - $81 = $75. So, Edward had $75 before he used his money.
Response:  If Edward spent $6 on buying 2 books and each book cost him the same amount of money, then he spent $3 per book. So, each book cost $3.
Response:  Before he spent his money, Edward had $25 (6 + 16). Now he has $19, so he spent $6 and $7 respectively. Therefore, Edward had $25 before he spent his money.
Response:  If Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pencils, then he has $12 - ($4 + $3) = $12 - $7 = $5 left after buying both. So, Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pencines.
"Response: 
Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he had $19 after buying both. To find out how much more he spent on books than pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had:
$19 - $8 = $11
So Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens."
Response:  Before he spent his money, Edward had $17. When he got $10 from his friend, he now has $27 ($17 + $10). So, Edward had $17 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 arm movements in gymnastics today and David did more than Zachary in terms of push-ups. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 44. Therefore, the total number of push-ups done by both Zachary and David together is equal to the sum of their individual numbers of push-ups, which is:  Zachary did 44 push-ups + David did x push-ups = 44 + x  In this case, x = 58 since David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary. So, the total number of push-ups done by both Zachary and David together is:  44 + 58 = 102
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract their numbers: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David did 44 arm movements in gymnastics today and he did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if David did x push-ups, then Zachary did x - 9 push-ups. Therefore, we can conclude that Zachary did 35 arm movements (x - 9).
Response:  We know that David did 51 arm curls in gymnastics today and he did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if David did x push-ups, then Zachary did x - 49 push-ups. Therefore, the total number of push-ups done by both David and Zachary is x + (x - 49) = 2x - 49.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches in gym class today. David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, which means he did 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. However, David did 27 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. So, David performed 78 push-ups and 17 crunches in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches in gym class today. David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary but fewer sit-ups (crunches). So if David did x push-ups, he would have done y crunches less than Zachary. Can you find out how many crunches David did?
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches in total.  David did more push-ups than Zachary (17), but fewer sit-ups (10). So we can conclude that Zachary did 53 - 10 = 43 push-ups and 14 crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches.  David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, which means he did 93 push-ups (58 + 35). However, David did 87 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 16 crunches (87 - 3). So, the difference in number of push-ups between Zachary and David is 93 - 35 = 58, and the difference in number of crunches between them is 16. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary. So, David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. Now we are told that David did 62 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. This means that if Zachary did x sit-ups, then David did x - 62 sit-ups. Therefore, the difference in number of sit-ups between Zachary and David is 46 (the number of push-ups Zachary did) minus 62 (the number of sit-ups David did). So, the difference in number of sit-ups between Zachary and David is 46 - 62 = -16. Therefore, Zachary did 16 more knæbøjninger than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 arm movements in gymnastics today. David did more than Zachary, so he must have done at least 19 + 3 = 22 arm movements. Since John did fewer push-ups than David, he did less than 22 arm movements. Therefore, David did 22 arm movements.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in gymnastics today. David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Now we are told that John did fewer push-ups than David. If John did x push-ups, then David did x + 22 push-ups. So, John did 49 push-ups (x - 22 = 49).
Response:  We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 39 push-ups.  Since John did 9 fewer push-ups than David, John did (x + 39) - 9 = x + 30 push-ups. Now we can find out how many push-ups Zachary did by subtracting John's number from David's number: x + 30 - 9 = 40. Therefore, Zachary did 40 push-ups.
Response:  If David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary, that means Zachary did x push-ups. Since David did 37 arm curls and Zachary did x push-ups, we can set up the equation: 37 = x + 30. Solving for x gives us x = 27. So Zachary did 27 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 56 more arm movements than Zachary in gymnastics today. So if David did 38 arm circles, then Zachary did x arm circles. Since they together did 56 more arm movements, we can set up the equation: 38 + x = 56. Solving for x, we get: x = 18. Therefore, Zachary did 18 arm circles.
Response:  We know that David did more push-ups than Zachary (40 vs 34). So if we divide the number of push-ups done by David by 2, we get the number of push-ups done by Zachary: 40/2 = 20 push-ups done by Zachary. Now, we also know that Zachary did more sit-ups than David (62 vs 0). So, to find out how many sit-ups David did, we can multiply the number of sit-ups done by Zachary by 2: 62 x 2 = 124 sit-ups done by David. Therefore, David did 20 push-ups and 124 sit-ups in total.
Response:  We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then we can say that Zachary did X push-ups where X is equal to 29 (since he did 58 - 36 = 22 more push-ups than David). Now we also know that Zachary did 33 crunches, so we can say that Zachary did Y crunches where Y is equal to 33 (since he did 33 - 33 = 0 more crunches than David). Therefore, Zachary did 29 + 33 = 62 total exercises.
Response:  We know that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, then he did 38 (17 + 21) crunches more than push-ups.
Response:  If Rachel had to do five pages of math homework and two pages of reading homework, then she would have done a total of 5 + 2 = 7 pages of homework. So, she did more math homework than reading homework.
"Response:  If Rachel had to do 3 sides of homework in math and 4 sides of homework in reading, then she would have done a total of:

Math Homework: 3 x 7 = 21 pages
Reading Homework: 4 x 7 = 28 pages
Total Homework: 21 + 28 = 59 pages
Therefore, Rachel had more reading homework than math homework."
Response:  If Rachel should do five pages of math homework and additional pages for reading comprehension, then she would have to do seven pages of homework in total. So, if she has to do seven pages of homework, then she will need to do one page of reading comprehension for every two pages of math homework, which is three pages of reading comprehension in this case. Therefore, Rachel needs to do three pages of reading comprehension as her additional homework.
"Response:  If Rachel has to do 7 sides of homework in mathematics and she wants to do 4 more sides than reading homework, then we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of sides of homework = 7 + (4 x Number of sides of reading homework)
= 7 + (4 x X)

Where X is the number of sides of reading homework that Rachel wants to do more than mathematics homework.

So, if Rachel wants to do 4 more sides of reading homework than mathematics homework, then the total number of sides of homework would be:

Total number of sides of homework = 7 + (4 x 3)
= 7 + 12
= 19

Therefore, Rachel should do 19 sides of homework in total - 7 sides of mathematics homework and 12 sides of reading homework."
Response:  If Rachel should do 8 pages of math homework and she wants to do 3 more pages than reading homework, then she would have to do 11 pages of math homework in total. So, the answer is 11 pages.
Response:  If Rachel should read 8 pages of math lessons and she reads 6 more pages than that, then she would have to read 8 + 6 = 14 pages in total.
Response:  If Rachel should write 10 pages of math homework and she decides to read 3 more pages than that, then she would need to write 13 pages (10 + 3 = 13).
"Response:  If Rachel should do two sides of lectures in mathematics, three sides of lectures in reading, and ten sides of lectures in biology, we can calculate how many total sides she needs to fill as follows:

2 + 3 = 5 sides of lectures in mathematics
10 = 10 sides of lectures in biology

Therefore, Rachel needs to fill a total of 5 + 10 = 15 sides of lectures."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework.  To find out how many more pages she had in math than in reading, we can subtract the number of pages she did in reading from the number of pages she did in math:

9 pages - 2 pages = 7 pages
So, Rachel had 7 more pages of math homework than she did in reading homework."
Response:  If Rachel had to do 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework, that means she did 11/5 = 2.2 pages of math homework per page of reading comprehension homework.  Similarly, if she had to do 3 pages of bio homework, that means she did 3/2 = 1.5 pages of math homework for every page of bio homework. So, Rachel had more math homework than bio homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So she did 7 + 11 = 18 pages of homework in total. Now we need to find out how many more pages of reading comprehension homework she had than math homework. To do this, we can subtract the number of pages of math homework from the total number of pages of homework: 18 - 7 = 11 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 11 more pages of reading comprehension homework than math homework.
Response:  If Rachel should make 9 pages of math homework and she has already made 11 pages of reading homework, then she still needs to make 8 more pages of reading homework (9 - 11 = 8). Similarly, if she has already made 29 pages of biology homework, then she still needs to make 71 pages of other subjects homework (29 - 9 = 62). So, in total, Rachel needs to make 62 pages of other subjects homework.
Response:  If Rachel should make 8 pages of math homework and she has to do 7 pages of reading comprehension, then she needs to make 1 page more of reading comprehension to fulfill the total number of pages required for both subjects. Therefore, she needs to make 8 + 1 = 9 pages of reading comprehension.  For biology, since it is only mentioned that she needs to make 3 pages of homework, she will need to make exactly 3 pages of biology homework. So in total, Rachel needs to make 9 pages of reading comprehension and 3 pages of biology homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete five pages of math worksheets and ten pages of reading comprehension exercises, she will need to do 5 + 10 = 15 pages of homework in total. Similarly, if she needs to complete six pages of biology worksheets, she will also need to do 6 + 10 = 16 pages of homework in total. Therefore, Rachel should complete 15 pages of reading and biology homework in total.
"Response:  If Rachel had more homework in math than reading, then she would have x + y = 4, where x is the number of pages for reading and y is the number of pages for math. Since there are 20 pages for reading and 16 pages for math, we can set up the equation as follows:
x + y = 4... (1)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 4 - y... (2)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
(4 - y) + y = 4
Combine like terms:
3y = 4
Divide both sides by 3:
y = 1
So, Rachel has 16 pages of math homework and 20 pages of reading homework."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to read 4 pages of lection in literature and 7 pages of lection in mathematics. Therefore, she had to read a total of 4 + 7 = 11 pages of lection. Now we are asked how many more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading did Rachel have. So let's subtract the number of pages of lection she had to read from the number of pages of homework in mathematics: 11 - 7 = 4 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 4 more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, we have:

Morning: 3 emails
Afternoon: 2 emails

To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning:

Number of more emails = Morning emails - Afternoon emails
= 3 - 2
= 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 more email in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  If Jack received 8 mails in the afternoon and 5 mails in the morning, then we can write this as follows:

Number of mails received in the afternoon = 8
Number of mails received in the morning = 5
Total number of mails received = Number of mails received in the afternoon + Number of mails received in the morning
= 8 + 5
= 13
Therefore, Jack received 13 more mails in the afternoon than he did in the morning."
"Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he must have received x emails in the afternoon. Since we know that Jack received 5 emails in total during the day (morning + afternoon), we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 5...(1)

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 5 - 4...(2)

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon."
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning, 5 emails in the evening, and 2 emails after lunchtime. Therefore, he received a total of 10 emails per day (3 + 5 + 2 = 10).
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 5 + 8 = 13 emails during these two time periods.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received five emails in the morning and eight in the evening. So, he received a total of 13 emails. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received four emails in the morning and eight emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 12 emails (4 + 8). Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  If Jack received 10 emails in the morning, that means he received 10 x 3 = 30 emails during the day (morning + afternoon).  If he received 7 emails in the afternoon, then he received 30 - 7 = 23 emails during the day.  Now, if he received 17 emails in the evening, then he received 23 + 17 = 40 emails overall. So, Jack received 40 emails more in the evening than he did in the morning.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the morning, 20 emails in the afternoon, and 7 emails in the evening. Therefore, we can calculate the difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the evening as follows:
Morning (3) - Evening (7) = 4 more emails received in the evening than in the morning."
Response:  If Jack received 10 emails in the morning, that means he received 10 x 2 = 20 emails total during the day (morning + afternoon).  Now, if we subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from those he received in the daytime, we get:  20 - 5 = 15 emails received in the evening. Therefore, Jack received 15 more emails in the evening than he did in the afternoon.
Response:  If Jack received 10 emails in total during the day (morning and afternoon), then he received 5 emails in the morning (since there are 2 time slots) and 5 emails in the afternoon (again, since there are 2 time slots). So, Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 10 emails received that day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So in total he received 67 messages (3 + 64 = 67).  In the afternoon, Jack received 5 emails and 54 letters. Therefore, in total he received 62 messages (5 + 54 = 62) per day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. So he got a total of 11 messages in the morning (5 emails + 6 letters = 11).  In the afternoon, Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters. Therefore, he received a total of 16 messages during the day (9 emails + 7 letters = 16).
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. So in total he received 22 messages (emails + letters).  In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So in total he received 47 messages (emails + letters) in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 8 letters and 2 emails.  Therefore, he received a total of 10 pieces of mail in the morning.  Later that day, he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters. So, in total, Jack received 9 more pieces of mail in the afternoon than he did in the morning (2 + 7 = 9).  Thus, Jack received a total of 19 pieces of mail during the day (10 + 9 = 19).
Response:  If Jack sent out 91 emails in the morning and received 2 emails, then he sent out a total of 93 emails (91 + 2).  In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and sent out 74 emails, so his total number of emails sent was 76 (74 + 2). Therefore, Jack received 2 emails per day and sent out 76 emails per day.
Response:  If Jack sent 8 letters in the afternoon and received 6 emails, then he must have sent more than 6 emails during the day. So, the number of emails that Jack sent is greater than or equal to 6. Therefore, the answer is 7 or more emails.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 + x mails in the afternoon, where x is the number of additional emails he received. So, Jack received a total of 7 + x mails that day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 16 emails in the evening. So, we can write this as follows:

Morning: 5 emails
Evening: 16 emails

Now, let's compare these two quantities:

5 < 16 (less than)

Therefore, Jack received more emails in the evening than he did in the morning."
Response:  If Jack received 10 emails during the day, and he got 3 emails in the afternoon, then he received 7 emails after noon (10 - 3 = 7).
"Response:  The distance that the grasshopper jumped is given as 9 tommer (which means ""tomme"" in Danish). A tomme is equal to 0.5 meters. So, the grasshopper jumped 9 x 0.5 = 4.5 meters.  Now, we are told that the seed sprang 12 tommer. Again, a tomme is equal to 0.5 meters, so the seed sprang 12 x 0.5 = 6 meters. Therefore, the seed has sprung further than the grasshopper."
Response:  The grashopper jumped 31 times its own length and the seed jumped 35 times its own length. So, the total distance they both jumped together is:  Distance = (Grasshopper's jump x Seed's jump) / (Grasshopper's jump + Seed's jump)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Distance = (31 x 35) / (31 + 35)  Distance = 2790 meters  Therefore, the combined distance that the grasshopper and the seed jumped is 2790 meters.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen sprang 36 tommer and Frøen sprang x tommer longer than Græshopperen. Musen sprang y tommer shorter than Frøen. So we can write an equation based on this information:  Distance = (Græshopperen + Frøen) - (Musen)  Substituting the values given in the problem:  Distance = (36 + x) - (y)  Solving for x:  x = 36 + y  Now we have found the distance Frøen sprang:  Frøen sprang 43 tommer.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen (Grasshopper) can jump 25 cm.  Frøen (Seed) jumps 18 cm more than Græshopperen, so it jumps 43 cm (25 + 18).  Musen (Mouse) jumps 2 cm less than Seed, so it jumps 41 cm (43 - 2). Therefore, Musen jumps 41 cm.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen sprang 19 tommer and Frøen sprang 10 tommer more than Græshopperen. So, Frøen sprang 29 tommer (10 + 19). Now we know that Musen sprang 20 tommer more than Frøen. Therefore, Musen sprang 49 tommer (20 + 29). Hence, Musen has sprung 49 tommer longer than Græshopperen.
Response:  We know that:  Græshopperen sprang 19 tommer.  Frøen sprang x tommer more than græshopperen. So, we can write an equation:  Frøen = Græshopperen + (x - 19). Now, we are given that Musen sprang 94 tommer less than frøen. So, we can substitute this value in the previous equation:  Frøen = Græshopperen + (x - 19) = Græshopperen + (94 - 19) = Græshopperen + 75. Therefore, Frøen sprang 75 tommer.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen (Grasshopper) can jump 25 cm.  Frøen (Seed) jumps 32 cm more than Græshopperen, so Frøen jumps 32 + 25 = 57 cm.  Musen (Mouse) jumps 26 cm less than Frøen, so Musen jumps 57 - 26 = 31 cm. Therefore, Musen jumps 31 cm.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen (Grasshopper) can jump 24 inches or 60 cm.  Frøen (Seed) jumps 33 inches or 84 cm more than Græshopperen. So, Frøen jumps 57 inches or 145 cm.  Now we need to find out how much Musen (Mouse) has jumped less than Frøen. Since Musen jumped 5 tommers less than Frøen, Musen has jumped 52 inches or 132 cm less than Frøen. Therefore, Musen has jumped 95 inches or 241 cm longer than Græshopperen.
"Response:  The first grashopper (Grasshopper 1) jumped 13 inches and then the second grashopper (Grasshopper 2) jumped 2 inches more than Grasshopper 1. So, Grasshopper 2 jumped 15 inches (13 + 2). Now we need to find out how far Frø (Seed) jumped. According to the question, Frø jumped ""hvor langt"" (how far) after Grasshopper 2. Since Grasshopper 2 jumped 15 inches, Frø jumped 15 - 2 = 13 inches. Therefore, Frø jumped 13 inches."
Response:  The first grasshopper (Græshopperen) jumped 35 centimeters (tommer).  The second grasshopper (Græshopperen) jumped 10 centimeters more than the first one, so it jumped 45 centimeters (10 + 35 = 45).  Therefore, together they jumped 35 + 45 = 80 centimeters.
Response:  We know that græshopperen (the grasshopper) jumped 19 tommers (or 19 cm).  Frøen (the seed) and musen (the mouse) participated in the competition as well.  According to the problem statement, græshopperen jumped further than frøen, so græshopperen's jump was 19 cm + 10 cm = 29 cm longer than frøen's jump.  However, we are also told that musen jumped 15 cm less than frøen. Therefore, frøen jumped 29 cm - 15 cm = 14 cm farther than musen.
Response:  We know that grashopperen (grasshopper) jumped 39 cm and Frøen (seed) jumped 12 cm less than grashopperen. So, Frøen jumped 39 - 12 = 27 cm.  Now we need to find out how much longer musen (mouse) jumped than Frøen. The question states that musen jumped x cm more than Frøen. Since Frøen jumped 27 cm, then musen jumped 27 + x = 66 cm.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen sprang 21 tommer and Frøen sprang 16 tommer less than Græshopperen. So, Græshopperen sprang 37 tommer (21 - 16 = 37) more than Frøen. Now we need to find out how much longer Græshopperen sprang than Musen. We are told that Græshopperen sprang 25 tommer more than Frøen. Therefore, Græshopperen sprang 52 tommer (25 + 37 = 52) more than Musen.
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the seed is 12 cm and the distance traveled by the grasshopper is 17 cm. So we can write this as follows:  Distance = Seed + Grasshopper  Distance = 12 + 17 = 29 cm  Therefore, the seed has traveled farther than the grasshopper by 7 cm (or 29 - 22).
Response:  We know that the grasshopper jumped 15 cm and the seed jumped 20 cm more than the grasshopper. So, the distance traveled by the seed is:  Seed = Grasshopper + (Seed - Grasshopper) = 15 + (20 - 15) = 35 cm  Therefore, the mouse jumped 35 cm.
Response:  We know that Græshopperen (the grasshopper) can jump 14 inches.  Frøen (the seed) can jump 37 inches more than Græshopperen. So, Frøen jumps 51 inches (37 + 14). Now we need to find out how much longer Musen (the mouse) jumps than Græshopperen. We are told that Musen jumps 16 inches less than Frøen. Therefore, Musen jumps 35 inches (51 - 16).
Response:  We know that there are 14 cups of flour required in the recipe and Mary has already added 5 cups of flour. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required: 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  If Mary has already added four cups of sugar to the mixture and the recipe calls for eleven cups of sugar in total, then we can calculate how many more cups of sugar she needs as follows:

Number of remaining cups of sugar = Total number of cups of sugar required - Number of cups of sugar added so far
= 11 cups - 4 cups
= 7 cups
Therefore, Mary needs seven additional cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour to make the cake batter and the recipe requires 6 cups of flour, then she needs 6 - x cups more flour where x is the amount of flour she has already added. Similarly, if the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar and Mary has already added some amount of sugar, then she needs 13 - y cups more sugar where y is the amount of sugar she has already added. So, we can write an equation as follows: 6 - x = 13 - y  Now, we need to solve for x. We know that x + y = 6 (since Mary started with some amount of flour) so we can rewrite the above equation as: 2x + y = 6 Substituting y = x, we get: 2x = 6 - x Solving for x : x = 4 Therefore, Mary needs 4 cups more of flour than the amount of sugar she has already added.
"Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (let's say x) and the recipe requires 11 cups of flour in total, then we can write an equation as follows:

x + 11 = 11

Now, if she still needs two more cups of flour than sugar, which is equal to 7 cups, we can write another equation:

x + 11 = 7

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 4

So, Mary has added 4 cups of flour so far."
"Response:  If we know that Mary has already added three cups of sugar to make the cake and the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar in total, then we can calculate how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. We do this by subtracting the number of cups she has already added from the total amount required:

11 cups - 3 cups = 8 cups
So, Mary still needs to add 8 cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
"Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (let's say x) and the recipe requires 12 cups of flour in total, then we can calculate how much flour she still needs to add as follows:

x + 12 - 5 = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

So, Mary has already added 7 cups of flour."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to the mixture. According to the recipe, she needs 9 cups of flour in total. So, we can calculate how many cups she still needs as follows:

Total amount of flour needed = 9 cups
Amount of flour already added = 3 cups
Remaining amount of flour needed = Total amount - Amount already added = 9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups
Therefore, Mary needs 6 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the mixture and the recipe requires 14 cups of sugar in total. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount required: 14 - 10 = 4 cups of sugar remaining to be added. Therefore, Mary needs 4 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  If we know that there are 12 cups of flour required for the recipe and Mary has already added 11 cups, then we can calculate how many more cups she needs to add. So, the number of cups of flour needed is:

12 - 11 = 1

Therefore, Mary needs to add one cup of flour more to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of sugar to the mixture (since she has ""lagt syv kopper mel i""). Now we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than flour are needed in order for the recipe to be balanced. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour used, there should be 2 cups of sugar used as well. So if Mary has already added 7 cups of sugar, and the recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar per cup of flour, then she needs to add an additional 5 cups of sugar ( since 7 / 2 = 3.5). Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of sugar to the mixture now."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of sugar (14/2 = 7) and she needs to add more sugar than salt. So, we can subtract 7 from the amount of salt required (14 - 7 = 7). Therefore, Mary should now add three more cups of sugar (3 + 7 = 10) to the recipe.
"Response:  If we start with 5 cups of sugar and then add another cup (which is what ""nu"" means in Danish), that would be 6 cups of sugar total. So, if the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and there are already 5 cups of sugar used, then the remaining amount needed is 1 cup of sugar."
Response:  If we start with 13 cups of sugar and Mary has already added 2 cups (as stated in the problem), then we are left with 13 - 2 = 11 cups of sugar remaining to be added. So, Mary needs 11 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of flour required in the recipe and Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total number of cups of flour required: 9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour remaining to be added. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that there are six cups of sugar and nine cups of flour in the recipe.  If we have already added two cups of flour (mel), then we need to add how many more cups of flour than sugar? So, we can calculate it as follows: 6 - 2 = 4 cups of sugar remaining + 9 - 2 = 7 cups of flour remaining. Therefore, she needs to add three more cups of flour than sugar.
"Response:  If we know that Mary has already added 11 cups of sugar to the mixture and the recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar in total, then we can calculate how many more cups of sugar she needs to add as follows:

Total amount of sugar needed = Number of cups of sugar in the recipe - Amount of sugar already added
= 5 cups - 11 cups
= -6 cups
So, Mary needs to add 6 cups of sugar more to the mixture."
Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of sugar (3 cups) and she still needs to add 5 more cups of sugar than flour (10 cups), then we can calculate how much flour Mary has added so far as follows:  Total amount of flour needed = Number of cups of sugar - Amount of flour already added = 10 cups - 3 cups = 7 cups So, Mary has added 7 cups of flour so far.
"Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of sugar and needs to add 12 more cups of sugar, then she must have started with an initial amount of sugar that is equal to or greater than 12 cups. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Sugar initially = Sugar needed + Initial Amount of Sugar

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Sugar initially = 12 + x

Where x is the initial amount of sugar that Mary had before starting to make the cake.

Now, we are asked how many cups of sugar Mary has left after adding 12 more cups. So, we need to find out how much sugar Mary has used so far. We know that the total amount of sugar required is 5 cups plus the initial amount of sugar (x), which gives us:

Total Sugar Required = 5 + x

Now, we can use the information that Mary has added 12 more cups of sugar to find out how much sugar she has used so far:

Used Sugar = Total Sugar Required - Number of Cups Added
= 5 + x - 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

Therefore, Mary had 9 cups of sugar initially."
Response:  We know that there are 14 cups of sugar required in the recipe and Mary has already added 60 cups of sugar. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar Mary has already added from the total amount of sugar required for the recipe: 14 - 60 = -46. Since it is not possible to have negative cups of sugar, we can conclude that Mary needs to add 46 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 46.
Response:  If Mary has already added 12 cups of sugar and wants to follow the recipe that requires 11 cups of sugar, then she needs to subtract 1 cup of sugar from what she has already added. So, the number of cups of sugar left for her to add is: 12 - 1 = 11 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of sugar to the mixture (she is halfway through). To find out how many more cups she needs, we can divide the total amount of sugar required by the amount she has already added:  Total amount of sugar = 3 cups + 10 cups + 15 cups = 38 cups. Since Mary has already added 6 cups, she still needs 32 cups of sugar (38 - 6 = 32). So, Mary needs 32 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour in the recipe. So far, Mary has added 4 cups of flour (mel). To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required: 9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour left to add. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour.
"Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar in total and we have already added 2 cups of sugar (since ""Hun har allerede lagt to kopper mel"" means ""She has already added two cups of sugar""). So, the number of cups of sugar left is 9 - 2 = 7 cups. Now, we need to find out how many cups of salt are needed. The recipe says ""4 kopper salt"", so we need to divide the number of cups of salt by the number of cups of sugar left to find out how much salt to add for each cup of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 4/7 = 0.57 or approximately 1/2 cup of salt."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of sugar to the mixture (she is halfway through). So if she needs to add 6 more cups of sugar, how many cups will be left after adding them all? Therefore, Mary needs 6 - 12 = 6 cups of sugar remaining.
Response:  If the recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and Mary has already added 4 cups, then she needs to add an additional 3 cups (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added ten cups of sugar to the mixture and the recipe requires twelve cups of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add now. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups of sugar she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 12 - 10 = 2 cups of sugar left to be added. Therefore, Mary needs to add two additional cups of sugar to the mixture.
"Response:  If 60% of bird families flew away to warmer lands during winter and there are currently 19 bird families near the mountain, then the number of bird families that remained behind is:

$$ Number \ of \ bird \ families \ remaining = 100\% - (60\% \times 19) $$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$ Number \ of \ bird \ families \ remaining = 100\% - (12%) $$

Therefore, $Number \ of \ bird \ families \ remaining = 88$ bird families stayed back in the area around the mountain."
"Response:  If we assume that each bird family has an average of 10 birds per family (which is a rough estimate), then:

* If 7 bird families flew away to migrate, there will be 7 x 10 = 70 birds less in the area.
* If 87 bird families remain in the area, then their total number will be 87 x 10 = 870 birds.

So, the difference between the number of birds remaining and the number of birds that flew away is:

870 - 70 = 790 birds."
Response:  We know that 20 bird families flew away to go overwinter in warmer lands and only 14 bird families stayed behind near the mountain. So, if we assume that there were initially X number of bird families living near the mountain before they started migrating, then after 20 bird families left, the remaining birds would be equal to X - 20. Therefore, the initial number of bird families living near the mountain was X = 34 (X - 20).
Response:  If 23 bird families flew to Africa and 37 bird families flew to Asia, then the total number of bird families that left the area near the mountain is: 23 + 37 = 60 bird families. So, there are 60 bird families remaining in the area near the mountain after some birds have migrated to other continents.
"Response:  We know that 42 bird families flew to Africa and 31 bird families flew to Asia. So, we have:

Africa = 42 / 8 = 5
Asia = 31 / 8 = 4
Therefore, more birds flew to Africa than to Asia."
"Response:  We know that 38 bird families live near the mountain and they migrate to warmer places during winter.  If 47 bird families flew to Africa and 94 bird families flew to Asia, then we can calculate the number of bird families that flew to each place as follows:

Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 47
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 94 - 47 = 47
Therefore, more bird families flew to Asia than to Africa."
Response:  We know that 38 bird families flew to Africa and 80 bird families flew to Asia. So, in total, we have 38 + 80 = 118 bird families flying away from their summer homes. Now, we are told that there are 18 bird families living near the mountain. Therefore, the number of bird families remaining at the mountain is 18 - 118 = -100. Since negative numbers indicate a decrease or absence of something, it means that none of the bird families remained at the mountain after they all flew away to warmer climates for winter.
Response:  If there are currently 87 bird families living near the mountain and 18 new bird families move in, then the total number of bird families living nearby will be: 87 + 18 = 105. Therefore, there are 105 bird families living near the mountain after the new families arrive.
Response:  We know that 59 families of birds flew away to go somewhere warmer and 24 new bird families came from the Arctic to settle near the mountain. So, we can write an equation: Number of bird families remaining = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that fled - Number of new bird families that arrived. Now let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of bird families = 49 (as mentioned in the question) Number of bird families that fled = 59 (given in the question) Number of new bird families that arrived = 24 (also given in the question) Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: Number of bird families remaining = 49 - 59 + 24 = 16 So there were 16 bird families left in the area near the mountain after all the migration.
"Response:  We know that 27 bird families flew away for winter from near the mountain. So initially there were 41 bird families in the area around the mountain. Now we are told that 27 of these families flew away for winter. Therefore, the number of bird families left behind near the mountain is:

$$ \boxed{ Number = 41 - 27 } $$

So, there were 14 bird families left behind near the mountain after 27 bird families flew away for winter."
"Response:  We know that in total, 86 bird families flew away for winter from near the mountain.  In the beginning, there were 45 bird families near the mountain. So, the difference between the number of birds that fled and those that remained is:  
$$ \boxed{\text{Difference = 86 - 45}} $$
Therefore, $ \boxed{\text{41 more bird families flew away than remained}} $."
Response:  We know that 35 bird families flew to Asia and 62 bird families flew to Africa. So, we can write this as : 35 + 62 = 97. Now,we need to find out how many more birds flew to Africa than to Asia. To do this, we subtract the number of birds that flew to Asia from the total number of birds that flew to both places : 97 - 35 = 62. Therefore, more birds flew to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that 3 families of birds live near the mountain and 2 families flew south to winter. So, we have a total of 5 bird families in the area. Now, let's consider the new families that arrived from the Arctic. They are 26 in number. Since they came from far north, it is likely that most of them will not migrate further south but will instead stay near the mountain. Therefore, we can assume that all 26 families will be present near the mountain after their arrival. This means that there are now a total of 5 + 26 = 31 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that Paul had 253 colored pencils at first and then he either lost or gave away 70 of them. So, we can write an equation: 253 - 70 = X Where X is the number of colorful pencils left with Paul after school year ended. Now we need to solve for X. To do this, we can use subtraction: 253 - 70 = 183 Therefore, Paul had 183 colored pencils left when the school year ended.
Response:  We know that Paul had 551 farvebleker at first and lost or gave away 374 of them (551 - 374 = 177). So he has 177 farveblekes left.
Response:  If Paul had 440 coloring books at first and gave away 111 during the school year, he would have 329 left (440 - 111 = 329). Then, if he lost 106 blyants, he would be left with 223 coloring books (329 - 106 = 223). So, Paul had 223 coloring books left after everything was said and done.
Response:  We know that Paul had 65 paintboxes at first and gave away 213 pencils during the school year. So he lost 16 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Paul had after giving them away is: 65 - 16 = 49 pencils.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 589 colored pencils in his case and gave away 571 during the school year while losing 161. To find out how many more he gave away than he lost, we can use the following equation:

Number of colored pencils given away - Number of colored pencils lost = Difference

Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get:

571 - 161 = 410

Therefore, Paul gave away 410 more colored pencils than he lost during the school year."
Response:  If Paul had 110 coloring books and gave away 90 during the school year, then he has 20 left (110 - 90 = 20).  If he lost 412 blyants, then he is left with (-412) = -638 blyants. So, he lost more than he gave away. The difference between the number of blyants he gave away and the number he lost is 90 - (-638) = 628 blyants. Therefore, he lost 628 more blyants than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 blyants during the school year and lost 558 blyants. So he had 332 - 558 = 174 blyants left at first. Now we are told that he received 332 farveblekser for his birthday. Therefore, he has now 174 + 332 = 506 blyants in total.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 492 blyants left at the end of the school year. If he gave away 52 blyants during the year and lost 535 blyants, then we can calculate how many blyants he had at the beginning of the year as follows:

Total number of blyants = Beginning balance + Gifts given - Losses
= 492 + 52 - 535
= 485

So, Paul had 485 blyants at the beginning of the school year."
Response:  We know that Paul had 521 colored pencils and 66 gummies in total when he was born. At the end of the school year, he had only 154 left without losing or giving any away. So, we can calculate how many were lost or given away as follows: Number of colored pencils lost/given away = Total number of colored pencils - Number of colored pencils left = 521 - 154 = 367 Number of gummies lost/given away = Total number of gummies - Number of gummies left = 66 - 0 = 66 Therefore, Paul lost/gave away 367 colored pencils and 66 gummies during the school year.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 531 coloured pencils and 38 gummies. At the beginning of the school year, he had 391 coloured pencils left without losing any. So, we can calculate how many more gummies he had at the beginning of the school year as follows: Number of gummies = Initial number of gummies - Number of gummies remaining = 38 - x Where x is the number of gummies Paul lost during the school year. Since Paul did not lose any gummies, x = 0, so the number of gummies Paul had at the beginning of the school year was 38. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of gummies and the number of gummies Paul had at the beginning of the school year is: Difference in gummies = Initial number of gummies - Number of gummies at the beginning of the school year = 38 - 38 = 0. So, Paul had no more gummies at the beginning of the school year than he initially had.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 601 farvebleker and 406 gummies in his piggy bank. At the beginning of the school year, he had 336 left without losing any gummy. So we can calculate how many more farbe blekes he had than gummies as follows: Number of farvebleker = Initial amount - Amount remaining = 601 - 336 = 265 Therefore, Paul had 265 more farvebleker than gummies after the school year ended.
Response:  We know that Paul had 315 farvebleke at the beginning of the school year and he lost or gave away 34 (315 - 34 = 281) during the school year. So, he has 281 left at the end of the school year. Then, we are told that he received 29 new ones for his birthday, so now he has 281 + 29 = 310 farvebleke in total. Therefore, the answer is 310.
Response:  We know that Paul had 267 colored pencils at first and lost 231 of them during the school year. So he has 36 (267 - 231) colored pencils left. Then we are told that he gave away 308 colored pencils to his friends. So now he has 36 - 308 = -272 colored pencils left. Since negative numbers indicate how many fewer something is than another thing, in this case, Paul gave away more colored pencils than he lost. Therefore, the difference between the number of colored pencils he gave away and the number he lost is 308 - 231 = 77.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 457 gummies and 320 colored pencils. If he didn't lose any of them during the school year, then he must have gained some new ones. The total number of gummies he had at the beginning of the school year was 457 + (number of days in the school year x number of gummies per day) = 457 + (180 x 457) = 457 + 83,960 = 84,810 gummies. Similarly, we can calculate the number of colored pencils he had at the beginning of the school year as follows: 320 + (number of days in the school year x number of colored pencils per day) = 320 + (180 x 320) = 320 + 57,600 = 377,600 colored pencils. Now, let's find out how many more colored pencils than gummies Paul had at the end of the school year: Number of colored pencils - Number of gummies = 377,600 - 84,810 = 292,790. So, Paul had 292,790 more colored pencils than gummies at the end of the school year.
Response:  At first, there were 11 customers. After some of them left, there were still 3 customers remaining. To find out how many more customers are left than those who left, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers at first. So, the answer is: Number of customers left = Total number of customers - Number of customers who left = 11 - 5 = 6 Customers.
Response:  The haved had three customers initially and after some of them left, he still had four customers remaining. So, the number of customers who left is equal to the number of customers he still has (4). Therefore, the number of customers who remained behind = 3 - 4 = -1 customer.
Response:  If he had 9 customers after 9 customers, then he started with 1 customer. Therefore, he had 12 - 9 = 3 customers in the beginning.
Response:  If the server had 14 customers initially and now there are only five left, then he has lost 9 customers (14 - 5 = 9). So, the number of customers the server still has is 9.
Response:  At first, the server had 13 customers. Then, some of them left, and he got 4 new customers. So, the number of customers the server has now is: 13 - (customers who left) + (new customers). In this case, we know that 5 customers left, so the number of customers the server has now is: 13 - 5 + 4 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 customers remaining.
Response:  At first, he had 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left and 14 new customers arrived. So, in total, he has 12 + 14 = 26 customers now.
Response:  The hawker had three customers initially and then more people came to buy from him, so he now has eight customers in total. To find out how many new customers have come, we need to subtract the number of original customers (3) from the current number of customers (8). Therefore, there are 5 new customers who have come to buy from the hawker.
Response:  The initial number of customers was 8. After some customers left, there were still 5 customers remaining. Then, he got 99 new customers. So, the total number of customers now is: 8 + 5 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 customers left.
Response:  The hawker had initially 12 customers. After some of them left, he still had 14 customers. So, the number of customers he has now is 14 - (the number of customers who left) = 14 - x, where x is the number of customers who left. Since we are given that x is equal to 3, so the number of customers the hawker has now is 14 - 3 = 11.
Response:  At first, Dan had $5 (starting amount). Then he spent $2 on the chocolate bar, so now he has $3 left ($5 - $2 = $3). Therefore, Dan started with $5.
Response:  We know that Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 on the chocolate bar. So, he has $1 left after buying the chocolate bar. Therefore, the cost of the chocolate bar is $3.
Response:  We know that Dan had $4 to start with and he bought 99 chocolate bars for $3 each. So, he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. Now we need to find out how much money is left with Dan after buying those chocolate bars. Therefore, we can subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $4 - $297 = -$293. So, there are -$293 remaining in Dan's pocket.
"Response:  If Dan has three dollars and bought two chocolate bars for $4 each, then he spent a total of:

$3 + ($2 x 2) = $3 + $4 = $7

So, each chocolate bar cost him $7 / 2 = $3.50."
Response:  If Dan has two dollars and bought some chocolate bars that cost $6 each, then he spent a total of $12 on those chocolate bars. So, if he spent $12 on them and they cost $6 each, then he must have bought 2/3 = 2 x 6 = 12 chocolate bars. Therefore, he bought 12 chocolate bars.
Response:  First, Dan spent $2 on one chocolate bar, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he spent another $3 on another chocolate bar, so now he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, there are $2 remaining dollars.
"Response: 
Dan spent money on two chocolates: one costing $7 and another costing $6. So, he spent a total of:
$7 + $6 = $13
Therefore, Dan used $13 to buy both chocolates."
Response:  If Dan spent $6 on one chocolate bar and $3 on another, then he spent a total of $6 + $3 = $9 on chocolate bars. So, he spent more money on buying chocolate bars than he did on buying chocolate.
Response:  If Dan spent $2 on one chocolate and $3 on another chocolate, then he spent a total of $5 on both chocolates combined. So, he spent $5 / 2 = $2.50 on each chocolate. Therefore, he spent more money on chocolate than he did on chocolate.
Response:  Firstly, Dan had 4 dollars and bought a chocolate bar for 8 dollars, so he spent 8 - 4 = 4 dollars. Now, his friend gave him 5 dollars, so there are 5 + 4 = 9 dollars left with Dan.
Response:  If Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 on the chocolate bar, then he has $1 left after buying it. So, the cost of the chocolate bar is $3.
"Response:  We know that Dan has $4 to spend and he spent $3 for 10 chocolate bars which cost the same amount. So, we can say:

$4 - $3 = $1

Therefore, there are $1 left with Dan after buying the chocolate bars."
Response:  If Dan has $3 and spent $4 for two chocolate bars that cost the same amount, then he had $3 - $4 = $1 left after buying the chocolate bars. So each chocolate bar costs $\$1$.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $3 to buy one chocolate bar. Therefore, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left after buying one chocolate bar. Now, he spends $7 to buy another chocolate bar. So, he uses up all of his remaining money ($2) and an additional $7, which means he now has zero money left.  Therefore, the amount of money that Dan used to buy chocolate bars is $7.
"Response: 
Dan spent $7 on chocolate and $2 on gum. So he spent a total of $9 (=$7 + $2). Therefore, he used $9 / $4 = $2.30 on chocolate per dollar he had ($4)."
Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them in a garage sale. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Books available = Initial books - Sold books.  In this case, the equation would be:  Books available = 115 - 78 = 37. Therefore, Paul has 37 books left after selling 78 at the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books in a garage sale, he had 105 left. So, if he started with some number of books (let's call it x), then we can set up the equation:

x - 137 = 105

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 269

So, Paul had 269 books in his collection to start with."
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after selling some in a garage sale he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows:  Books available = Initial books - Number of books sold (garage sale)  In this case, the number of books sold in the garage sale is equal to 108 - x, where x is the number of books sold. Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:  Books available = 108 - x  Now, we are given that Paul gave 35 books to his friend. So, the number of books available for him is reduced by 35:  Books available = 108 - x - 35  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Books available = 73  Therefore, Paul sold 35 books in the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and after buying some from an auto sale he had 151 left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books bought = Total number of books - Remaining books After buying = 50 - 151 = -101 books Therefore, Paul has bought 101 books.
Response:  If Paul had 2 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale, then he has X - 2 = 58 books left. Now, if he bought 150 new books, then the total number of books he has is X + 150 = 58. Solving for X, we get X = 43. So, Paul sold 43 books in the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale, then he had fewer books than before. Let's assume that he sold x books. Then, after buying 42 new books, he has a total of 21 + 42 = 63 books now. So, he sold more books (x) than he bought (42). Therefore, the difference between the number of books he sold and the number he bought is equal to the initial number of books he had minus the number of books he sold: 63 - x = 21.  Thus, he sold 42 more books than he bought.
Response:  If Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale, then he has fewer books than before. Let's say he sold x books. Then, he had 71 - x books left. Now, he bought 38 new books, so he has 71 - x + 38 = 116 books now. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he bought: x + 38 - x = 30. Therefore, he bought 30 more books than he sold.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 pens initially. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. To find out how many books he sold in the garage sale, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:

Let x be the number of books Paul sold in the garage sale.
We know that after the sale, Paul had 66 books left, so the total number of books he had before the sale (108) minus the number of books he sold (x) equals the number of books he had left after the sale (66):

108 - x = 66

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 54

So, Paul sold 54 books in the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had 51 books and 106 pens before selling some in the garage sale. After the sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. So, if he sold x pens in the garage sale, we can write an equation as follows: Books = 51 + x Pens = 106 - 14 = 92 Now, we need to find out how many pens he sold in the garage sale. To do this, we divide the number of pens he had after the sale (14) by the number of pens he had before the sale (106): x = 14 / 106 = 0.13 Approximately, he sold 13 pens in the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul had 136 books at first and sold some of them in the garage sale, then he must have started with more than 27 books (the number he left with). So, we can deduce that he sold x - 27 = 109 books initially.
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave away 39 to his friend. So he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then he sold some books in a garage sale and had 68 books left. Therefore, the number of books he sold in the garage sale is 68 - 95 = -27 books. He did not sell any books in the garage sale as he had fewer books than he started with.
Response:  We know that Paul had 95 pens and 153 books initially. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Pens = 95 - x Books = 153 - y Where 'x' is the number of books sold in the garage sale, and 'y' is the number of pens sold. Now, we are asked how many books Paul sold in the garage sale. To find out, we can substitute the value given in the question into our equation: Pens = 95 - x Books = 153 - y Substituting x = 7 (the number of books sold in the garage sale), we get: Pens = 95 - 7 Books = 148 Now, we can solve for 'y', which represents the number of pens sold: Pens = 95 - 7 Books = 148 y = 26 Therefore, Paul sold 26 pens in the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 143 books and 42 pens before selling some of them in the garage sale. After the sale, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. So, if we subtract the number of books he sold from the original number of books, we get: Number of books sold = Original number of books - Number of books left after sale = 143 - 113 = 30 books. Therefore, Paul sold 30 books in the garage sale.
Response:  Jessica has 8 roses from her garden and she lays them in the vase. So, there are 8 + 8 = 16 roses in the vase now.
Response:  We know that Jessica added 16 roses to the vase and there are now 23 roses in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses she added from the current number of roses, we get:  Number of roses in the vase at the beginning = 23 - 16 = 7. Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning.
Response:  Jessica had 2 roses in the vase initially and then she threw 4 roses out of the vase and cut some new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. So, there are now 2 + 4 = 6 roses in the vase. Then, she added more roses, so there are now 6 + x = 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, x = 17. So, Jessica has cut 17 roses from her flower garden to add to the vase.
Response:  Jessica threw away 33 roses and added new ones to the vase, so there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she cut than she threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase after she added new ones. So, the answer is:  Number of more roses she cut = Total number of roses in vase after adding new ones - Number of roses she threw away = 17 - 33 = -16. Therefore, Jessica cut 16 fewer roses than she threw away.
Response:  Jessica removed 34 roses from the vase and cut some new ones from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she removed than she cut, we can subtract these two numbers: 34 - 15 = 19. So, Jessica removed 19 more roses than she cut.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses in the vase and Jessica cut 3 from her garden which had 59 roses in total. So, after she cut those 3 roses, there are now 20 roses left in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica cut is equal to the difference between the initial number of roses in the vase (7) and the final number of roses in the vase (20): 7 - 20 = -13. So, Jessica has cut -13 roses from her garden.
Response:  If there were initially 12 roses in the garden and Jessica removed 5 of them (as stated in the problem), then there are now 7 roses left in the garden.  Since Jessica also added 3 more roses to the vase, there are now 10 roses in total in both the vase and the garden. So, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that there were originally 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the original number of roses (15) from the new number of roses (17): 17 - 15 = 2. Therefore, Jessica cut 2 roses from her flower garden.
Response:  We know that there were originally 2 orkideoers in the vase and then Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her flower garden. After she finished cutting, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the original number of orchids (2) from the new total number of orchids (21): 21 - 2 = 19. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orkideoers from her flower garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were five roses and three orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now there are 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of orchids from the total number of flowers: 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 orchids and 7 roses in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden and added them to the vase, so now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers: 20 - 11 = 9. So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If there were three roses in the vase to begin with and she cut 16 roses from her garden, then how many roses are left in the garden after cutting those 16 roses? The answer is 3 - 16 = -13 roses. So, if there were three roses in the vase initially, Jessica must have cut 13 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now, there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before (13) from the number of roses after (14). Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 orkideoers in the vase and Jessica removed 2 of them, leaving us with 1 orkidioer remaining. Then she added 7 roses to the vase, so now there are 7 + 1 = 8 flowers in total in the vase. Therefore, Jessica has removed 2 orkideoers from the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her flower garden. Now there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of roses and orchids as follows: Number of roses - Number of orchids = 22 - 20 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 orchids and 9 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more orchids and roses from her flower garden. Now, we have 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids: 13 - 3 = 10. So, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 meters long and she cut some centimeters off it, then her new length is 13 meters. So, she cut 4 meters (or 40 centimeters) of her hair.
Response:  If Robin cut off 20 meters of her hair and now it is 10 meters long, then before she cut it, it was 30 meters long (20 + 10 = 30).
"Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 16 meters long and she cut off 35 centimeters (or 0.35 meters), then her remaining hair would be:

$$ \text{Original length} = 16 \text{ meters} $$

$$ \text{Cutoff length} = 0.35 \text{ meters} $$

Now, let's find out how much her hair grew back:

$$ \text{New length} = \text{Original length} - \text{Cutoff length} $$

Substituting the values we know, we get:

$$ \text{New length} = 16 \text{ meters} - 0.35 \text{ meters} $$

Simplifying and solving for $\text{New length}$, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{New length} = 15.65 \text{ meters}} $$

Therefore, Robin's hair is now $15.65$ meters long."
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 meters long and she grew an additional 18 meters, then her new length would be:  19 + 18 = 37 meters. So, Robin's hair is now 37 meters long.
Response:  If Robin cut off 13 tommers of her hair and it was originally 14 tomers long, then how much is her hair now? So, we can see that after cutting 13 tomers of her hair, she has 14 - 13 = 1 tomer of hair left. Therefore, her hair length now is 1 tomer or 10 cm.
"Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 14 meters long and grew by 15 centimeters (or 6 inches), then it is now:

Hair length = Original length + Growth
= 14 m + 15 cm
= 14 m + 6 in
= 20 m

So, Robin's hair is now 20 meters long."
Response:  We know that Danny had 12 bottlecap in his collection before he found 53 bottle caps in the park. So, if we multiply 12 by 53, we get 636. Therefore, Danny now has 636 bottlecaps in his collection.
Response:  If Danny has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he found 7 bottle caps in the park, then he now has 21 + 7 = 28 bottle caps in total.
Response:  We know that Danny found 63 flaskehuller in the park and smashed 51 of them. This means he had 63 - 51 = 12 flaskehullers left after smashing some. Now, we are told that he has 33 flaskeborre in his collection. So, the number of flaskehullers Danny had at the beginning is equal to the number of flaskeborre he has now, which is 33. Therefore, the answer is 33.
Response:  We know that Danny found 36 flaskehuller in the park and smashed 35 of them. So he had 1 more than the number of flaskehullers he smashed. Therefore, the difference between the number of flaskehullers he found and the number he smashed is equal to the total number of flaskehullers he found minus the number he smashed.  That is, 36 - 35 = 1.  So, Danny found 1 more flaskehuller in the park than he smashed.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 flaskehuller in the park and he smashed 63 old beetles. So, the total number of flaskehullers he had before smashing them is: 30 + 63 = 93. Now, we are told that after smashing them, he has 42 flaskeborre in his collection. Therefore, the difference between the number of flaskehullers he found and the number he smashed is: 93 - 42 = 51. So, Danny smashed 51 more flaskehullers than he found in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 0 flaskehuller because he didn't have any yet. Then, he found 22 flaskeborster and added them to his collection, so now he has 22 flaskehuller. Next, he found 8 more packings and added them to his collection, giving him an additional 8 flaskehuller. Therefore, in total, Danny started with 0 flaskehuller and now has 30 (22 + 8).
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 flaskehuller and 30 packings in the park. This means he collected 22 + 30 = 52 items. Now, we are told that he has 17 flaskeborers and 57 packings in his collection. So, he must have had 17 - 5 = 12 packings in his starting collection. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 30 flaskeborster and found 14 packings in the park. So he had 30 + 14 = 44 flaskehullers at first. Now he has 7 more flaskeborsters, so he has 44 + 7 = 51 flaskehullers left. Therefore, Danny found 51 - 30 = 21 flaskehullers in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 11 flaskeborre and 28 pakninger in the park initially. Then he found 6 more flaskeborre and 5 more paknings. So, his new collection is 68 flaskeborre and 51 pakning. To find out how many more paknings he found than flaskeborre, we need to subtract the number of flaskeborre from the number of pakning. Therefore, the answer is 51 - 11 = 40 more paknings found by Danny in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 71 flaskehuller and 24 packings in the park initially. Then he found 28 flaskeborers and 16 packings in his collection. So, the total number of flaskehuller Danny has now is:  Initially, Danny had 71 flaskehuller + 24 packings = 95 flaskehuller. Now, he has 28 flaskeborers + 16 packings = 44 flaskehuller left. Therefore, the number of flaskehuller Danny has now is 95 - 44 = 51 flaskehuller.
Response:  We know that Danny had 10 flaskeborster and 62 paper clips in the park initially.  He found 27 more flaskeborsters and 43 more paper clips in his collection now. So, the total number of flaskeborsters he has is 27 + 10 = 37. Similarly, the total number of paper clips he has is 43 + 62 = 105. Therefore, Danny has 37 more flaskeborsters than paper clips now.
"Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 bottle caps in the park and now has 25 left. So, if he had x bottle caps at the beginning, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 92

So, Danny had 92 bottle caps at the beginning of the game."
Response:  If Danny had 25 flaskehuller in his collection earlier and found 32 more in the park, then he now has a total of 57 flaskehuller (25 + 32). Therefore, the answer is 57.
Response:  We know that Danny had 60 old bottles in his collection before he went to the park and found new ones. So, initially, Danny had 60 + 58 = 118 bottle caps in total. Therefore, the correct answer is (118).
Response:  We know that Danny found 50 new flaskehuller in the park and he already had 6 of them from before. So, altogether he has 60 flaskeborre in his collection now. To find out how many more flaskehullers Danny found than he threw away, we need to subtract the number of flaskehullers he threw away (6) from the total number of new flaskehullers he found (50). Therefore, the answer is 44 (50 - 6 = 44).
Response:  We know that Danny found 48 new bottle caps in the park and he already had 54 old ones, so together they have 102 bottle caps. Now, we are told that Danny has 52 bottle caps left in his collection after he smashed some of them. Therefore, the number of bottle caps Danny smashed is equal to the difference between the total number of bottle caps he found (102) and the number of bottle caps he has left (52):  Smashed bottle caps = 102 - 52 = 50. So, Danny smashed 50 more bottle caps than he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 82 paper clips and found 29 empty bottles in the park. So he now has 82 + 29 = 111 objects in his collection. Then, he caught 42 more bottlescapes, which means he now has 111 + 42 = 153 objects in his collection. Finally, we are told that he has 61 plastic bags in his collection, so the total number of objects he had at the end is 153 + 61 = 214 objects. Therefore, Danny had 29 empty bottle caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 16 flaskeborster and now he has 68 in his collection. So, he must have collected 52 additional flaskeborsters.  Now, we are told that he found 66 paper papers and 39 glass bottles in the park. Since each paper can be used to make one flaskeborster, Danny will have 66 / 1 = 66 flaskeborsters from the papers. And since each glass bottle can also be used to make one flaskeborster, Danny will have 39 / 1 = 39 flaskeborsters from the glass bottles. Therefore, the total number of flaskeborsters Danny had at the beginning is 66 + 39 = 105.  As for the packets, we are told that Danny found 66 packet wrappers and now he has 68 in his collection. So, he must have collected 66 - 68 = -2 packets.
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 paper clips and 50 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 21 bottle brushes and 52 packages in his collection. So we can conclude that Danny found 50 - 21 = 29 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 65 paper clips and 5 bottle caps before he found any more items in the park.  After finding additional items, he now has 31 bottle caps and 9 packages in his collection. So, we can calculate how many more packages he found as follows:  Number of packages found = Total number of packages after finding additional items - Initial number of packages = 9 - 5 = 4 packages. Therefore, Danny found 4 more packages in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 11 packagings and 12 bottle caps in his collection before he found more bottles and packages in the park. If he found 58 bottles and 25 packages in the park, then he now has 63 bottles (58 + 5) and 37 packages (25 + 12). So, Danny now has 37 package hulls in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny had 15 flaskeborster and 18 packings in the park. He now has 67 paper papers and 35 glass capsules in his collection. To find out how many more packaging he has than bottle caps, we need to subtract the number of paper papers from the number of glass capsules. So, the answer is:  Number of additional packages = Number of paper papers - Number of glass capsules = 67 - 35 = 32. Therefore, Danny has 32 more packagings than bottle caps.
Response:  If Jake has 11 fewer freshmen than Steven, then Steven must have 11 + 1 = 12 more freshmen than Jake. So, if Jake has 17 freshmen, then Steven must have 17 + 12 = 39 freshmen.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer freshmen than Steven, who has more freshmen than Jill. So we can start with Jake and count how many freshmen he has less than Steven. If Jake has x freshmen, then Steven has x + 14 freshmen. Therefore, Jake has 7 - (x) = 7 - (x + 14) freshmen. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So Jake has 7 freshmen.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 18 ferrets (he has 18 - 1 = 17).  We also know that Steven has more than 13 ferrets (he has 13 + 6 = 19). So, Jill must have at least as many ferrets as Steven minus the number of ferrets Jake has. Therefore, Jill has at least 19 - 17 = 2 ferrets.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than eight freshmen less than Steven, so he must have five or six freshmen. Since Jill has three more freshmen than Steven, she must have two or four freshmen more than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 6 - 4 = 2 more freshmen than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 ferrets less than Steven, who has 11 more ferrets than Jill. So, if we subtract 12 from Jill's number of ferrets (which is not given), we get:  Jill has 49 ferrets (12 - 11 = 1).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer freshmen than Steven and more freshmen than Jill. So we can start with an estimate of how many freshmen Jake has based on those two facts.  If Jake has fewer freshmen than Steven, then he must have at least as many freshmen as Steven minus his own number of freshmen. Therefore, if Steven has x freshmen, Jake has at least x - 7 freshmen. Similarly, since Jake has more freshmen than Jill, he must have less than or equal to Jill's number of freshmen plus his own number of freshmen minus Jill's number of freshmen. So Jake has at most x + 9 - x = 9 freshmen.  Now let's find the exact value of x using the information given in the problem. According to the problem, Steven has 16 freshmen, so Steven's total number of students is 16 + 7 = 23. Since Jake has fewer freshmen than Steven, Jake's total number of students is also less than 23. Moreover, Jake has more freshmen than Jill, who has 8 freshmen according to the problem. So Jake's total number of students is between 8 and 23 inclusive. The only integer between 8 and 23 is 14, which means that Jake has exactly 14 students in addition to his 7 freshmen, for a total of 21 students.
Response:  We know that Jake has seven freshmen less than Steven and eight more than Jill. So, if we let S be the number of freshmen Steven has, then Jake has 7S - 7 = 5 fewer freshmen than Steven. And Jill has 8 more freshmen than Jake, so she has 5 + 8 = 13 freshmen. Therefore, Jill has 13 freshmen.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 less freshmen than Steven and 18 more freshmen than Jill. So, if we let S be the number of freshmen Steven has, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
S - 9 = Jakes ferskner
Jakes ferskner + 18 = Jills ferskner
We also know that Jill has 16 freshmen. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get:
18 + 16 = S
Solving for S, we get:
S = 34
So, Steven has 34 more freshmen than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 18 freshpersimmons. So let's say he has x freshpersimmons. Since Jake has fewer than 6 freshpersimmons, we can say that Jake has y freshpersimmons, where y < x. Now, we are told that Jill has five freshpersimmons. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: x + y = 5 (since Jill has 5) and y > 0 (since Jake has at least one freshpersimmon). Solving for y, we get y = 3. So, Jake has 3 freshpersimmons.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer freshmen than Steven. So if Steven has x more freshmen than Jake, then Jake has x - 5 freshmen.  Since Jill has 87 freshmen, we can say that Jill has 87 - 5 = 82 more freshmen than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 82 + 5 = 87 more freshmen than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 fewer freshmen than Steven. So if Steven has x freshmen, then Jake has x - 16 freshmen.  We also know that Steven has 15 more persimmons than Jill. So if Jill has y freshmen, then Steven has y + 15 persimmons.  Finally, we are told that Jill has 12 fewer freshmen than Steven. So if Steven has z freshmen, then Jill has z - 12 freshmen.  Substituting these equations, we get:  Jake has x - 16 = 16 (since he has 16 fewer freshmen than Steven) Jill has y = z - 12 (since she has 12 fewer freshmen than Steven) Solving for x and y, we find that:  X = 24 (Steven has 24 freshmen) Y = 30 (Jill has 30 freshmen) Therefore, Jill has 10 more freshmen than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer fresh apples than Steven. So if Steven has x fresh apples, then Jake has x - 12 fresh apples. Similarly, we know that Jake has 79 more pears than Steven. So if Steven has y pears, then Jake has y + 79 pears. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  x - 12 = (y + 79) / 2  To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, we can do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 2:  x = (y + 79) / 2 - 12  Simplifying this equation gives us:  x = y + 67  Therefore, Jake has 67 fresh apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer fresh apples than Steven. So if Steven has x fresh apples, then Jake has x - 13 fresh apples. Also, we know that Jake has 3 more pears than Steven. So if Steven has y pears, then Jake has y + 3 pears. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  x - 13 = (y + 3) / 2  To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, we can divide both sides of the equation by -13 and then simplify:  x = (y + 3) / 2  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  x = (9 + 3) / 2  = 12  Therefore, Jake has 12 fresh apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 more apples than pears. So if Jake has x pears and y apples, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 9 = y (1) Since Steven has 17 pears and 16 apples, we can write another equation as follows:
x + 16 = 17 (2) Now we need to find out how many more pears than apples Steven has. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:
x - 16 = 9 (3) Solving for x, we get:
x = 23 (4) Therefore, Steven has 23 more pears than apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer fresh apples than Steven and 10 more pears than Steven. So if we write it down like this:
Jake has x fresh apples and y pears.
Steven has x + 3 = 12 fresh apples and y - 10 = 15 pears.
Now we can solve for y (the number of pears) in both equations:
x + 3 = 12... (1)
y - 10 = 15... (2)
Solving equation (1), we get:
x = 9
Substituting this value into equation (2), we get:
y = 18
So Steven has 18 pears more than Jake."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 ferrets and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, we can start with an estimate of Jake having 9 ferrets (since he has 4 less than Steven). Now, let's see how many ferrets Jill has. According to the problem statement, Jill has 67 more ferrets than Jake. Therefore, if Jake has x ferrets, then Jill has x + 67 ferrets. Substituting this into our equation for Jake's number of ferrets, we get:  Jake has 9 ferrets, so Jill has 9 + 67 = 76 ferrets.  So, Jake has 9 ferrets.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 ferskners and Jake has fewer than 18 ferskners. Therefore, we can say that Jake has x ferskners, where x is less than or equal to 18.  Moreover, we are told that Jill has 8 more ferskners than Jake. So, if Jake has x ferskners, then Jill has x + 8 ferskners.  Now, we need to find out how many ferskners Jill has. Since x is less than or equal to 18, we can write x = 10, for example. Then, Jill has 10 + 8 = 18 ferskners.  Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 ferrets and Jake has fewer than 19 ferrets. So, we can say that Jake has x ferrets, where x is less than or equal to 19. Also, we know that Jill has 72 ferrets more than Jake. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Jakes ferrets = x (x ≤ 19) + 72  Now, let's solve for x using substitution method.  First, we will solve for the inequality x ≤ 19.  Since 19 > 0, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 19 to get x < 19.  Next, we will substitute this value in the original equation:  Jakes ferrets = x (x < 19) + 72  Now, we can simplify the equation:  Jakes ferrets = x + 72  Finally, we can solve for x by subtracting 72 from both sides of the equation:  x = Jakes ferrets - 72  Substituting the given information, we have:  x = 19 - 72  x = -53  Therefore, Jake has 53 ferrets.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 ferrets and Jake has fewer than 14 ferrets. So, we can say that Jake has x ferrets, where x is less than or equal to 14. Also, we know that Jill has three more ferrets than Jake, so Jill has x + 3 ferrets. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies all these conditions. Let's substitute the values in the equation: Jake has x ferrets, Steven has 14 ferrets, and Jill has x + 3 ferrets. Substituting these values, we get: x + (x + 3) = 14 - x Jake has x ferrets, Steven has 14 ferrets, and Jill has x + 3 ferrets. Substituting these values, we get: x + (x + 3) = 14 - x Solving for x, we get: x = 7 Therefore, Jill has 7 ferrets.
"Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has y ferskner, we can write an equation:
Jake = x + 84 (since he has 84 more apples than Steven)
Steven = y + 10 (since he has 10 fewer fermented cherries than Jake)
Now we have two equations:
x + 84 = 93 (from the first equation)
y + 10 = 43 (from the second equation)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 93 - 84 = 9
So Jake has 9 ferskner."
"Response:  We know that Jake has more fresh apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x fresh apples and Steven has y fresh apples, we can write an equation:
Jake = x + 13 (fresh apples)
Steven = y + 17 (fresh apples)
We also know that Jake has fewer dried apricots than Steven. So, if Jake has z dried apricots and Steven has w dried apricots, we can write another equation:
Jake = x + 13 - z (dried apricots)
Steven = y - w (dried apricots)
Now we have two equations and three variables to solve for x, y, and z. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the following values:
x = 15 (fresh apples)
y = 9 (fresh apples)
z = -4 (dried apricots)
Therefore, Jake has 15 fresh apples, Steven has 9 fresh apples, and Jake has -4 dried apricots."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer fresh apples than Steven and 10 more pears than Steven. So, if we let X be the number of fresh apples Steven has, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
X + 10 = 8 (since Jake has 8 fewer fresh apples)
X = 18 (since Steven has 18 fresh apples)
Now, we want to find out how many more fresh apples Steven has than Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of fresh apples Jake has from the number of fresh apples Steven has:
Number of fresh apples Steven has - Number of fresh apples Jake has = 18 - 8 = 10
So, Steven has 10 more fresh apples than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer fresh apples than Steven and 4 more pears than Steven. So, if we let X be the number of fresh apples Steven has, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:
X + 4 = 3 (since Jake has 3 fewer fresh apples)
Jake has 19 æbler, so he must have X - 15 æbler (since Steven has 15 fresh apples).
Now we can substitute these equations into each other to solve for X:
X + 4 = 3... (1)
Jake has X - 15 æbler... (2)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
X + 4 = 3
X = 18
So, Steven has 18 æbler more than Jake."
Response:  If there were $78 in Olive's drawing book and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then she has $63 left ($78 - $15 = $63).
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and has $33 left, then she must have had $105 in her wallet to begin with ($78 + $33 = $105).
Response:  We know that there were initially $100 in Olive's drawing book and she took $148 from an ATM. So, after her visit to the supermarket, there was $159 left. To find out how much Olive spent at the supermarket, we can subtract the amount she had before ($100) from the total amount left after her visit ($159): $$ \therefore Spent = Total - Initial = 159 - 100 = 59 $$ Therefore, Olive spent $59 at the supermarket.
Response:  We know that there were $3 in Olive's drawing book and she took $49 from an ATM. After visiting the supermarket, there was $49 left. So, we can write this equation:  $3 + ($49 - x) = $49 where x is the amount of money Olive spent at the supermarket. Now, let's solve for x:  $3 + ($49 - x) = $49  Subtracting $3 from both sides gives us:  $46 = x  Dividing both sides by $46 gives us:  x = 10  Therefore, Olive collected $10 more than she spent at the supermarket.
"Response:  We know that $53 was in Olive's drawing book and she took $91 more from an ATM. So, after her visit to the ATM, there were $143 - $53 = $90 left with Olive. Now, we need to find out how much money Olive spent at the supermarket. According to the question, ""After she visited a supermarket, there were $14 dollars left."" Therefore, the amount of money Olive spent at the supermarket is $14. Subtracting this amount from the total amount of money she had ($90) gives us the difference between the two amounts: $90 - $14 = $76. So, Olive used $76 more than she collected from the ATM at the supermarket."
Response:  We know that there were initially $106 in Olive's sketchbook and she spent some money at both the supermarket and the showroom. After visiting these places, there was $26 left in her sketchbook. If she then used $49 in the exhibition room, we can calculate how much she spent at each place as follows: Supermarket: $26 - $49 =-$23 Exhibition room: $49 Showroom: $106 - $49 = $57 So, Olive spent $23 at the supermarket and $57 at the showroom.
Response:  If there were $54 in her wallet at the beginning and she spent $29 at the store, then she has $25 left ($54 - $29 = $25).
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet to begin with, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  If Dave had 19 apps on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 apps left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
"Response:  At first, Dave had x apps on his phone. After deleting 18 of them, he was left with y apps. Since he still has 5 apps remaining, we can set up the equation:
x - 18 = y + 5
Now solve for x:
x = y + 18
So, Dave had 23 apps on his phone in the beginning (y + 18)."
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 apps on his phone initially and then added 11 new ones. So, he has a total of 21 apps (10 + 11) now. Then we are told that after deleting some apps, he is left with 4 apps. Therefore, the number of apps that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of apps and the final number of apps, i.e., 21 - 4 = 17.  Hence, Dave has deleted 17 apps from his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 apps on his phone initially and he added 89 new ones. So, in total, he has 21 + 89 = 110 apps now. Then we are told that after deleting some of them, he was left with 24 apps. Therefore, the number of apps he added minus the number of apps he deleted is equal to the final number of apps he has (110 - 24 = 86). So, Dave has added 86 more apps than he has deleted.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 15 apps on his phone initially. Then he added 71 new apps to it. So, in total, he has 86 apps (15 + 71) now. To find out how many more apps he deleted than he added, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the total number of apps he added. Therefore, if he deleted some apps after adding 71 new ones, then the difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of apps he deleted. In other words, the answer can be found as follows: Number of apps deleted = Total number of apps added - Number of apps left After simplifying the equation above, we get: Number of apps deleted = 86 - x Where 'x' represents the number of apps left on Dave's phone after deleting some of them. Now, we are given that after deleting some apps, Dave was left with 14 apps. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: Number of apps deleted = 86 - 14 = 72 So, Dave deleted 72 apps more than he added.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 apps and 77 files on his phone initially. After deleting some apps and files, he had 5 apps and 23 files left. To find out how many apps Dave deleted, we can divide the number of apps he had after deletion (5) by the initial number of apps (16): 5/16 = 0.3125. Since there are 4 apps in each quarter, Dave deleted approximately 4 apps. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 files initially and after deleting some of them he was left with 3 files. So, we can say that he deleted 18 files ( = 21 - 3).
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone. Then he deleted some apps and files, so he had 21 apps and 4 files left. To find out how many more apps than files he has left, we need to subtract the number of files from the number of apps: 21 - 4 = 17. So, Dave has 17 more apps than files left on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone. Then he deleted some apps and files, so he had 6 apps and 15 files left. To find out how many more files than apps he has left, we need to subtract the number of apps from the total number of files: 6 apps + 15 files = 21 files. So, Dave has 21 more files than apps left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 apps on his phone and then added some more, he would have 18 apps left. So, he must have added 1 app to his phone. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and 15 apps initially. After deleting some files and apps, he had 12 apps and 30 files left. To find out how many apps Dave deleted, we can divide the number of apps he had after deletion (12) by the initial number of apps (15):

Number of apps deleted = Number of apps after deletion / Initial number of apps
= 12 / 15
= 8
Therefore, Dave deleted 8 apps from his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 apps initially. After deleting some apps and files, he had 17 apps and 21 files left. To find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the initial number of files he had:  Number of files deleted = Initial number of files - Number of files after deletion = 24 - 21 = 3  So, Dave deleted 3 files.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. Then he deleted some apps and files, leaving him with 5 files and 12 apps remaining. To find out how many more apps than files he has left on his phone, we can subtract the number of files from the number of apps: 12 apps - 5 files = 7 apps. So, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. Then he deleted some apps and files, leaving him with 24 files and 2 apps remaining. To find out how many more files than apps he has left on his phone, we can subtract the number of apps from the total number of files:  Number of files = 24 Number of apps = 2 Subtracting the number of apps from the total number of files gives us the difference between the two quantities: Difference = Number of files - Number of apps = 24 - 2 = 22 So, Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.
Response:  If Nell had 242 cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has 242 - 136 = 106 cards left. So, Nell has 106 cards left.
Response:  If Nell had 301 cards and gave 301 to Jeff, then she has none left. So, in first instance, Nell had 301 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Then she had 252 cards left. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her original amount, we get:  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = Total number of cards - Number of cards left after giving some to Jeff  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 528 - 252 = 276 cards. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards.
Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, she now has 535 cards left. So, Jeff must have received some of those cards from her. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of cards Nell has = 535 (given) Number of cards Jeff has = x ( unknown ) Now, let's solve for x using substitution method : Number of cards Jeff has = Number of cards Nell has - Number of cards he got from Nell Number of cards Jeff has = 535 - x x = 535 - 566 x = -131 Since negative numbers are not possible in this case, we can conclude that Jeff has 0 cards. So, the correct answer is: Jeff has 0 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-cent cards initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of cards. After giving away some cards, she had 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-cent cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-cent cards, we need to subtract the number of ten-cent cards from the number of baseball cards. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  415 - 149 = 266 Therefore, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than ten-cent cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card packs initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of cards. Specifically, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card packs left after giving some to Jeff. To find out how many more ten-card packs than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of cards she has:  Number of ten-card packs = Total number of cards - Number of baseball cards  In this case, the total number of cards is 404 + 495 = 899. Subtracting the number of baseball cards (246) gives us the number of ten-card packs:  Number of ten-card packs = 899 - 246 = 653 So, Nell has 653 more ten-card packs than baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving some to John, she had 210 cards left. So, if she gave X cards to Jeff, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of cards Nell has = 573 - X. Now, we are told that after giving some cards to John, Nell had 210 cards left. Therefore, substituting this value in the above equation, we get: 573 - X = 210. Solving for X, we get: X = 363. So, Nell gave 363 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards she has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball cards:  Number of baseball cards = Total number of baseball cards - Number of ten-card packs  In this case, the total number of baseball cards is 178, and the number of ten-card packs is 55. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  Number of baseball cards - Ten-card packs = 178 - 55 = 123  Therefore, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 376 ten-cards and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more ten-cards than baseball cards Nell has, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of ten-cards: 376 - 111 = 265. So, Nell has 265 more ten-cards than baseball cards.
Response:  If Paco started with x kags and ate 19 of them, then he has 35 - 19 = 16 kags left. So, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Paco had 28 cakes and he ate some of them, then he has less than 28 cakes left. We know that he has 7 small cakes left, so we can deduce that he ate more than 7 cakes. Therefore, the number of cakes Paco ate is greater than 7.
Response:  If Paco had 40 sausages and he ate two of them, then he has 38 sausages left. So, the answer is 38.
Response:  Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, now he has 25 - 5 = 20 cookies left. He bought x cookies. Since he already ate 5, we can say that he bought x - 5 = 15 cookies more than he had initially.
Response:  Paco had 13 cats and he ate two of them. So, he bought how many more cats than he ate?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of cats he ate from the total number of cats he had.  Therefore, the answer is: 13 - 2 = 11.  So, Paco bought 11 more cats than he ate.
Response:  Paco had 40 kager initially and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 kager left. Then, he gave 13 kager to his friend, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 kager left. Therefore, Paco had 22 kager left after giving some to his friend.
Response:  Paco had 17 cakes and he ate 14 of them, so he has 17 - 14 = 3 more cakes than he gave his friend.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them, so he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. Then, he gave his friend 21 cookies, which means that his friend got 21 + (-4) = 17 more cookies than Paco had initially. So, Paco gave his friend 17 more cookies than he had himself.
Response:  Paco had initially 22 sweet candies and 75 salted candies, so together he had 97 candies (22 + 75). Then, he ate 15 sweet candies and 54 salted candies, leaving him with 82 candies (97 - 15 - 54). Therefore, Paco had 82 small candies left after eating some of them.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 9 sweet cakes and 6 salty cakes. He then ate 36 sweet cakes and 3 salty cakes. So, he has eaten a total of 36 + 3 = 40 cakes. Now, we need to find out how many salty cakes Paco had left after eating those. To do this, we can use the information that he started with 6 salty cakes. Therefore, the number of salty cakes Paco had left after eating is 6 - 3 = 3.
Response:  We know that Paco had in total 37 sweet cakes and 11 salted cakes. If he ate five sweet cakes and two salted cakes, then we can say that he ate a total of 5 + 2 = 7 cakes. So, he has 37 - 7 = 30 sweet cakes left. Now, let's compare this with the number of salted cakes he ate, which is 11. Therefore, he has more sweet cakes than salted cakes. The difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of sweet cakes he ate minus the number of salted cakes he ate, which is 30 - 11 = 19. So, Paco spat
"Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet cakes and 6 salted cakes initially. He then ate 20 sweet cakes and 34 salted cakes. To find out how many more salted cakes he ate than sweet cakes, we can subtract the number of sweet cakes he ate from the total number of salted cakes he ate:

Number of salted cakes eaten = Total number of salted cakes - Number of sweet cakes eaten
= 6 + 34 - 8
= 42

Therefore, Paco ate 42 more salted cakes than sweet cakes."
Response:  If Paco had 37 kags in the beginning and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 kage left. So, Paco has 1 kage remaining.
Response:  Paco had initially 36 cakes and gave 14 to his friend. So he has 36 - 14 = 22 cakes left. Then, he ate 10 of them, leaving him with 22 - 10 = 12 cakes. Therefore, Paco had 12 cakes left.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then, he ate 18 of them. Therefore, he has 32 - 18 = 14 cookies left after eating.  Hence, he spat more than he gave away.
Response:  Paco gave his friend 30 candies and he ate 23 candies. So, the difference between the number of candies given to his friend and the number of candies eaten is:  30 - 23 = 7. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 7 more candies than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 97 salted crackers and 34 sweet crackers. If he ate 15 sweet crackers, then he has 34 - 15 = 19 sweet crackers left. Similarly, if he ate 56 salted crackers, then he has 97 - 56 = 41 salted crackers left. Therefore, Paco has 19 + 41 = 60 crackers left in total.
Response:  Paco had initially 26 salted crackers and 17 sweet crackers, for a total of 43 crackers. Then he ate 14 sweet crackers and 9 salted crackers, leaving him with 26 - 14 = 12 salted crackers and 17 - 9 = 8 sweet crackers. So, Paco had 12 salted crackers and 8 sweet crackers left after eating some of them.
Response:  We know that Paco had 39 sweet cakes and 6 salty cakes in total. He ate 23 salty cakes and 32 sweet cakes. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Sweet cakes = Total cakes - Salty cakes  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Sweet cakes = 39 + 6 - 23 = 14  Therefore, Paco ate more sweet cakes than salty cakes.
Response:  We know that Paco had in total 65 candies (40 sweet and 25 salty). He ate 28 salty candies and 15 sweet candies. So, if we subtract the number of sweets he ate from the total number of candies he had, we get: Total number of candies - Number of sweets = 65 - 15 = 50 Now, we can see that Paco ate more salty candies than sweet ones. Therefore, the difference between the number of salty candies he ate and the number of sweet candies he ate is equal to the total number of candies he had minus the number of sweets he ate: Difference = Total number of candies - Number of sweets = 50 - 15 = 35 So, Paco ate 35 more salty candies than sweet candies.
Response:  If she had $7 to start with and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $2. Therefore, she spent $2.
Response:  If Hun gave Gwen $10 for her birthday and she spent $8 of it, then she has $2 left ($10 - $8 = $2). So, Gwen received $10 for her birthday.
Response:  Hun had $10 from her mother ($20 - $4 = $8). Then she spent $3, so she had $8 - $3 = $5 left.
Response:  Hun fik $8 from her mother and $5 more from her father. If she spent $4, then she received $12 ($8 + $5) from her mother and $4 from her father. So, she received $16 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Hun fik $3 from her mother and $6 more from her father, so she received a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she used $4 of it, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). So, her father gave her $5 more than her mother.
"Response: 
Gwen received $5 from her father and then her mother gave her $7 more. So, in total, she got $5 + $7 = $12 from both of them.  If she used $4 of it, then she has $12 - $4 = $8 left with her. Therefore, her mother gave her $8 more than her father did."
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and her mother gave her $2 more, then she has a total of $7 ($5 + $2).  If she spent $6, then she has $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, her father gave her more money than her mother did.
Response:  If Josh had 9 balls in his collection and he lost some of them, then he has fewer balls now than he did before. So, if he has 4 balls left, that means he must have lost 5 balls (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had x kugler in his collection and lost 21 kuglers, then he has x - 21 kuglers left. Now, if he has 12 kuglers, we can set up an equation as follows: x = 12. Solving for x, we get that Josh originally had 12 kuglers in his collection.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 19 balls in his collection and lost 11 of them. So he has 19 - 11 = 8 remaining balls. Then, he found 5 new balls. Therefore, he now has 8 + 5 = 13 balls in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 4 kugs in his collection and lost 16 of them, then he had 4 - 16 = -12 kugs left. But if he found 8 new ones, then he has now 8 + 4 = 12 kugs in his collection. So, he lost more kugs than he found.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had seven marbles in his collection and lost eight of them. So he had seven - 8 = 9 marbles left. Then, he found ten new marbles. Therefore, he now has nine + 10 = 19 marbles in total. So, he found more than he lost.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles in his collection and he found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left in his collection. So, he now has 14 marbles.
Response:  Josh had 20 balls in his collection and gave one ball to Jack. So now he has 20 - 1 = 19 balls left.
Response:  Josh had 22 marbles in his collection initially. Then, Jack gave him 20 marbles. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 11 kuglers in his collection earlier and he added 9 more kuglers now, then he has 20 kuglers in total (11 + 9 = 20).
Response:  If Josh had 22 balls in his collection and found 13 of them, he now has 9 (22 - 13 = 9) balls left. However, if he lost 5 balls, then he has 4 balls remaining (9 - 5 = 4). So, Josh currently has 4 balls in his collection.
"Response:  If Josh had 15 balls in his collection and found 9 of them, then he lost 23 balls. To find out how many more balls he lost than he found, we can subtract the number of balls he found (9) from the total number of balls he had (15):

15 - 9 = 6

So, Josh lost 6 more balls than he found."
Response:  We know that Josh had three balls in his collection and found six marble pieces while losing five marble pieces. To find out how many more balls he found than he lost, we can use the following equation: Number of balls found = Number of balls lost + Number of marble pieces found The number of balls found is equal to the number of balls lost plus the number of marble pieces found. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of balls found = 3 + 6 = 9 So, Josh found nine more balls than he lost.
Response:  If Marco and his father together weigh four pounds of strawberries, then Marco alone must have weighed nineteen pounds more than that amount. So if they together weigh four pounds, then Marco alone would weigh 19 + 4 = 23 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weigh 23 pounds more than his father's.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 35 pounds of strawberries.  If Marco's strawberry weighs 5 kg (which is equal to 11 lbs), then his father's strawberry must weigh more than him by 24 pounds (35 - 11 = 24). So, his father's strawberry weighs 24 + 11 = 35 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 20 pounds of strawberries. His father has 17 pounds of strawberries. So, if we subtract what his father has from what they both have, we get: 20 - 17 = 3 pounds. Therefore, Marco's share of the strawberries is 3 pounds.
Response:  If Marco's strawberries weigh 8 pounds and his father's strawberries weigh 32 pounds, then together they have 40 pounds of strawberries (8 + 32 = 40).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father collected 24 kg of strawberries together. Then, on their way back, Marco lost 9 kg of strawberries. So, now Marco has 1 kg of strawberries left. To find out how much his father's strawberries weigh, we can simply subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total amount they collected: 24 kg - 1 kg = 23 kg. Therefore, his father's strawberries weigh 23 kg.
Response:  Marco and his father collected together strawberries weighing 10 kg (Marco's share). On their way back, Marco's father lost 8 kg of strawberries (his share). So now Marco has 12 pounds of strawberries (10 kg x 2 = 20 lb), which is equal to 5 kg (since 1 lb = 0.453592 kg). Therefore, Marco's father's remaining strawberries weigh 8 kg - 5 kg = 3 kg or 7.2 pounds (since 1 lb = 0.453592 kg).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father collected 22 pounds of strawberries together. Then, when they were returning home, his father found an additional 30 kilograms (or 30 pounds) of strawberries. So, in total, Marco has 22 + 30 = 52 pounds of strawberries now.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father were picking strawberries together.  Marco's strawberry weighs 5 kg (kilograms). If their combined weight of strawberries is 37 pounds (pounds), then we can calculate how much each strawberry weighed as follows:

Weight of all strawberries = Total weight in pounds / Number of strawberries
= 37 pounds / 2 (since there are two people)
= 18.5 pounds per person

So, if Marco's strawberry weighs 5 kg, then his father's strawberry must weigh:

Weight of his father's strawberry = 18.5 pounds - 5 kg
= 13.5 pounds

Therefore, his father's strawberry weighs 13.5 pounds or approximately 6 kg."
Response:  If Marco and his father together picked 30 pounds of strawberries, then each of them must have picked half of that amount, which is 15 pounds.  Since Marco's strawberries weigh more than his father's, he must have picked 15 + 3 = 18 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weigh 18 pounds more than his father's.
Response:  If Marco and his father were picking strawberries together, and Marco's strawberry weighed five kg (5), then his father's strawberry would have to weigh more than five kg (5) to make up for the total weight of their strawberries together, which is 26 pounds or 11.7 kg (11). So, his father's strawberry must weigh at least 11.7 - 5 = 6.7 kg (6.7) more than Marco's strawberry.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father were picking strawberries together. His father's strawberry weighed 5 kg (Marco's father's strawberry). If their strawberries together weighed 30 pounds (13.6 kg), then how much does Marco's strawberry weigh?  Therefore, Marco's strawberry weighs 27 kg - 5 kg = 22 kg.
Response:  Before stopping at the bus stop, there were 10 children in total on the bus. When more children got on the bus after stopping, then there are now 10 + x children in total on the bus, where x is the number of additional children who got on the bus after stopping. So, the answer is 10 + x = 10 (the original number of children) + however many children got on the bus after stopping.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children in the bus. Then, 38 more children got on the bus at the stop. So, now there are 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  Before stopping at the bus stop, there were some children in the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus was 41. To find out how many children were in the bus before it stopped, we need to subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the total number of children in the bus after it stopped. Therefore, the answer is 39 (41 - 2).
Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the bus stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children who stepped off = Total number of children - Number of children remaining in the bus.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of children who stepped off = 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, 22 children stepped off the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the bus stop (we don't know how many). So, after they left, there were 18 children remaining in the bus. To find out how many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than are now, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children. Therefore, the answer is: 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 of them got off at the bus stop while some others went to the bus. So, the total number of children left in the bus was 16. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the bus. Then, we are told that 63 children got off the bus while some others went on it. So, the total number of children on the bus after this process is 14 (as given in the question). Now, to find out how many more children came on the bus than those who got off, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children on the bus: 5 - 63 = -58. Therefore, there were 58 more children who came on the bus than those who got off.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and 68 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children on the bus was 36 + 68 = 104 children. Now, we are told that ""several"" children went on the bus, which means that some children got on the bus after it left the stop. Therefore, the final number of children on the bus is 104 - 12 = 92 children. So, the correct answer is 92 children more than the initial number of children who came on the bus."
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children in the bus. Then, at the bus stop, 40 children got off the bus, leaving 2 children still on it. So, the final number of children on the bus is 2. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is 40 - 2 = 38.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus. Then, at the stop, 82 more children got on the bus, so the total number of children in the bus became 108 (28 + 82). Now, some children got off the bus, leaving only 30 children remaining. So, the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children is equal to the number of children who got off the bus. Therefore, the answer is 58 (30 - 28) more children came onto the bus than those who got off it.
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus. Then, when the bus stopped, 24 children got off the bus, leaving 8 children still on it. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who got on the bus minus the number of children who were already on the bus. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the number of children who got on the bus is 24 - 8 = 16. Hence, 16 more children got off the bus than got on it.
Response:  If baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than 51 cakes. So, we can say that the number of cakes baker made is equal to 133 - 51 = 82. Therefore, baker made 82 additional cakes beyond what he sold.
Response:  We know that baker sold some of his eggs and still has 13 left. So if he started with 54 eggs (kagers), then he must have sold x eggs. Since he still has 13 eggs left, we can write an equation: 54 - x = 13. Now solve for x : x = 40. Therefore,baker sold 40 eggs.
"Response:  We know that baker made 145 kags and sold them all. So he must have started with some number of kagers (let's call it x). Since he still has 72 kagers left after selling all the others, we can write an equation: 
x + 72 = 145
Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations:
x = 145 - 72
= 73
So baker made 73 kages in total!"
Response:  If baker has 155 cakes and his friend buys 140 from him, then he will have 155 - 140 = 15 cakes left.
Response:  If baker sold 105 of his 121 cakes and bought 170 new ones, then he has (121 - 105) = 16 remaining cakes. So, baker still has 16 cakes.
Response:  If baker sold 91 kags and bought 154 new ones, then he has 63 more kagers than he sold (154 - 91 = 63). So, baker bought 63 more kagers than he sold.
Response:  If baker sold 78 kags and bought 31 new ones, then he has 47 remaining kagers (78 - 31 = 47). So, the difference between the number of kagers sold and the number of kagers bought is 47. Therefore, the answer to the question is 47.
Response:  The baker made 110 bagels and sold 75 of them. This means he has 35 extra bagels (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made 76 more bagels, so now he has 35 + 76 = 111 bagels in total. Therefore, the baker still has 111 bagels.
Response:  If baker made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them, then he has 73 remaining (144 - 71 = 73). So, he produced more than he sold. The difference between the number of cakes he produced and the number he sold is equal to the number of cakes he still has (73). Therefore, the answer is 73.
Response:  If baker sold 10 kags and had 90 kagers left, then he would have 80 kagers left after selling those 10 kagers. So, the number of kagers baker has left is 80.
Response:  If bakeren sold 15 kags and 103 kagers, he would have sold in total 118 kagers (15 + 103).  Now we need to find out how many kagers bakeren had at first. According to the question, he had 7 kagers and 148 bagvérk. So, if he sold 118 kagers, he must have had 118 - 7 = 111 kagers left after selling. Therefore, bakeren would have 111 kagers left.
Response:  If bageren sold 115 kags and 81 kagers, then he had 37 kagers left (126 - 115 = 37). So there were more than 37 kagers at the beginning if he sold that many.
Response:  We know that the baker made 19 large cakes and 131 small cakes in total. If he sold 70 large cakes and 88 small cakes, then we can calculate how many more cakes he sold as follows: Number of additional cakes = Total number of cakes sold - Total number of cakes made = 70 + 88 = 158 - 229 = -71 cakes So there were 71 fewer cakes sold than the total number of cakes made by the baker.
Response:  If baker sold 158 kags and 147 bagvæk, then he sold more kagers than bagvæk. So, if we subtract the number of bagvæk from the total number of products sold, we can find out how many more kagers were sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of kagers and bagvæk is equal to 158 - 147 = 11.  Hence, baker sold 11 more kagers than bagvæk.
"Response:  We know that baker sold more than he had at first because we are told that ""he sold 68 kags and 92 kagers"". So if he started with 54 kagers and 143 bagvérk, then he must have had fewer kagers after selling some of them.  Therefore, the number of kagers baker sold is equal to the difference between his initial amount of kagers (54) and the total number of kagers he had left after selling some (68 + 92 = 150).  So, baker sold 150 - 54 = 96 additional kagers."
Response:  If the baker sold 44 bagels and had made 48 in the beginning, then he would have 4 (48 - 44) bagels left.
Response:  If baker made 40 kags in total and sold 8 of them, then he must have produced more than 8 times as many kagers as he sold. So if he sold 8 kagers, he must have produced at least 8 x = 64 kagers (since we know that he did not produce exactly 64 kagers).
Response:  If baker had initially made 169 cakes and sold 137 of them, then he would have 32 left (169 - 137 = 32).
Response:  If baker started with 173 kags and bought 103 new ones, then he has now 276 kagers (173 + 103).  If he sold 86 kagers, then he still has 190 kagers (276 - 86).
Response:  If baker bought 167 new cages and sold 89 cages, then he must have had some old cages that he did not sell.  So let X be the number of old cages he had at first. Then we know that total number of cages he has is equal to the number of old cages plus the number of new cages he bought. Therefore, the equation is:  Number of cages = X + 167. Now we are given that he sold 89 cages. So the number of cages he had left after selling is equal to the number of cages he had initially minus the number of cages he sold. Therefore, the final equation is: X - 89 = X + 167. Simplifying this equation, we get: 256 = 256. This means that baker did not buy or sell any cages. The correct answer is (0).
Response:  If baker bought x new cakes and sold y more cakes than he bought, then we can write an equation as follows:  x + y = 8 (the number of cakes he already had)  Since he sold 145 more cakes than he bought, we have:  y = 145 - x  Substituting this value in the first equation, we get:  x + (145 - x) = 8  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 67  Therefore, baker purchased 67 new cakes and sold 67 + 145 = 212 cakes more than he bought.
Response:  If baker made 62 cakes and then made 149 more, he has a total of 211 cakes (62 + 149 = 211). Then, if he sold 144 of them, that means he still has 7 cakes left (211 - 144 = 7). So, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  If baker made 81 bagels and then made 92 more, he has a total of 173 bagels (81 + 92).  He sold 46 of them, so the number of bagels left with him is 173 - 46 = 127.  Therefore, baker made 92 more bagels than he sold.
Response:  If baker sold 108 kags and 44 kagers, he would sell a total of 152 kagers (108 + 44).  Now, we need to find out how many kagers baker had at first. According to the question, baker had 61 kagers and 167 kagers, so in total he had 228 kagers (61 + 167). Therefore, baker would have 134 kagers left after selling 152 kagers (228 - 152 = 134).
Response:  If baker sold 104 kags and 29 bagværk, then he would have sold a total of 133 kagers (104 + 29).  Since he started with 56 kagers and 124 kagers, that means he has 56 + 124 = 178 kagers left after selling 133 kagers. Therefore, baker will have 178 - 29 = 149 bagværk left.
Response:  If bageren sold 102 kags and 94 kagers, then he had 52 + 84 = 136 kags left after selling those two amounts. So there were more than 136 - 52 = 84 kags left.
Response:  If the baker made 134 bagels and sold 140 bagels, then he has 6 more bagels to sell than he made (140 - 134 = 6). Similarly, if he made 11 bagels and sold 92 bagels, he has 81 more bagels to sell than he made (92 - 11 = 81). So, there are 6 + 81 = 87 more bagels for sale than the baker produced.
Response:  If baker sold 8 kags and 97 kagers, he sold more than 14 kagers because he started with 14 kagers and added 97 kagers to that amount. So if he sold 8 kagers, then he must have had at least 22 kagers left (14 + 97 = 111). Therefore, baker sold more than 14 kagers.
Response:  If baker sold 154 kags and 78 kagers, he would have sold in total 232 kagers (154 + 78).  Now we know that baker had 43 kagers left after selling all his products, so the number of kagers he sold is equal to the number of kagers he had left minus the number of kagers he sold, which is 43 - 232 = -190 kagers. So, baker sold more than 190 kagers than what he had initially.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and wants to have 140 games back, she needs to buy X number of games. We know that 140 is the desired total, and 22 is the current number of games she owns. So we can set up an equation like this:

X = 140 - 22

Now we need to solve for X. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 22:

X / 22 = (140 - 22) / 22

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:

X = 68

So Kelly needs to buy 68 more Nintendo games to reach her goal of having 140 games in total."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and gives away 64 of them, then she will have 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games.
Response:  At first, Kelly had 91 Nintendo games. If she still has 92 matches left, that means she started with more than 91 games. So, in the beginning, Kelly had 91 + x games, where x is the number of games she had at the start. Since she gave away 91 games and now has 92 matches remaining, we can set up the equation: 91 + x = 92. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. Therefore, Kelly had 10 games at the start.
Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and wants to have 12 of them left after giving some away, then she must give away at least 8 Nintendo games (since 20 - 8 = 12).
Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to give away so that she has 31 Sony games left, we can subtract the number of Sony games she already has from the total number of Sony games she owns. So, if Kelly gives away x Sony games, she will have 132 - x Sony games left. Since she wants to have exactly 31 Sony games left, we can set up the equation: 132 - x = 31. Solving for x, we get: x = 98. Therefore, Kelly should give away 98 Sony games in order to have 31 Sony games left.
Response:  Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 of them. To find out how many she needs to give away so that she has six matches left, we can use subtraction. So, Kelly needs to give away 49 games (80 - 31 = 49).
"Response:  If Randy has x blocks to begin with and he uses y blocks to build the tower, then the number of blocks left after building the tower is equal to x - y. So we can set up an equation as follows:
x = Number of blocks Randy had in the beginning
y = Number of blocks used to build the tower
Now we are given that there are 38 blocks left after building the tower, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
x - y = 38... (1)
We also know that Randy used 52 blocks to build the tower, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
y = 52... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for x using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving Equation (1), we get:
x = 52 + 38 = 90... (3)
So Randy had 90 blocks in the beginning."
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. After using some for the tower, there are 72 blocks left. So, we can write an equation: Number of blocks used = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks left. In this case, it would be: Number of blocks used = 97 - 72 = 25 blocks. Therefore, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks and he uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of blocks used for the tower = 14 Number of blocks used for the house = 11 Now, we need to find out how many blocks are left after building these structures. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for each structure from the total number of blocks available: Blocks left over = Total number of blocks - (Number of blocks used for the tower + Number of blocks used for the house) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Blocks left over = 79 - (14 + 11) = 54 Therefore, there are 54 blocks left over after building the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Tower = 27 blocks House = 53 blocks Total =? To find out how many blocks Randy used for both the tower and the house together, we need to add the number of blocks used for each one: Tower + House = Total blocks Therefore, we have: 27 + 53 = 80 blocks So, Randy used 80 blocks in total to build the tower and the house together.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks and he used them to build a tower and a house.  To find out how many more blocks were used for the tower than the house, we can use the following equation:
Number of blocks used for the tower - Number of blocks used for the house = Number of more blocks used for the tower
We are given that Randy used 33 blocks to build the tower and 13 blocks to build the house. So, if we subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks available (37), we get:
33 - 13 = 20
Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
Response:  To build a house, Rand used 82 blocks. To build a tower, he used 79 blocks. So, we can write an equation: House = 82 and Tower = 79. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks were used for building the house than for building the tower. We do this by subtracting the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: Number of blocks used for house - Number of blocks used for tower = 82 - 79 = 3. Therefore, Rand used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 36 blocks to build his tower and he uses all of them. So, there are no blocks left. If he had 59 blocks in total, then he would have used 36 blocks to build the tower and there would be 23 blocks left (59 - 36 = 23).
Response:  To build a house, he used 20 blocks. So, to build a tower, he used x - 20 blocks, where x is the number of blocks needed for the tower. Since he has 95 blocks in total, we can write an equation:  x = 95 - 20. Solving for x gives us x = 75. Therefore, he used 75 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks and he used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of blocks used for the house = 89  Number of blocks used for the tower = 63  Now, we want to find out how many more blocks were used for building the house than for building the tower. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house:  Difference in number of blocks = Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Difference in number of blocks = 89 - 63  = 26  Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
"Response:  If there are 20 books in the series ""The Clumsy, Stupid School"" and you have not read 5 of them yet, then you have read 15 books from the series."
"Response:  If you have read 13 books in the series and there are 8 books left to read, then the total number of books in the series is:  Number of books read = 13 Books left to read = 8 Total number of books = 13 + 8 = 21 Therefore, there are 21 books in the series ""Den Skøre Dumme Skole""."
Response:  We know that there are 22 books in the series and you have read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of books: 22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, you still need to read 10 more books from the series. Similarly, if you have seen 56 films among the 100 films in the series, then you still need to see 44 more films (100 - 56 = 44).
Response:  If there are 4 books and 17 films in the series, that means there are 4 x 17 = 68 different media items in total.  Since you have read 19 books and seen 7 films, that means you still need to see 68 - 7 = 61 more films. Therefore, you should watch 61 more films from the series.
"Response:  If there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""The Stupid, Dumb School"", then we know that there are more books than films.  Therefore, if you have read 19 books and seen 13 films, it means that there are 6 more books (19 - 13 = 6) than films (13). So, the answer is 6."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""The Stupid School"". If you have read 19 of the books and seen 61 of the films, then we can calculate how many more films than books there are in the series as follows:

Films - Seen = Books - Read = 61 - 19 = 42

So, there are 42 more films than books in the series ""The Stupid School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in the series ""The Stupid School"". If you have read 13 of the books and seen 12 of the films, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than films as follows:

Books - Films = Number of more books read
= 13 - 12
= 1

So, you have read one more book than film."
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 films in the series. If you have read 7 books, then you have not seen any of the films yet. So, the number of films you have seen is equal to the number of books minus the number of books you have read, which is 11 - 7 = 4. Therefore, you have seen 4 films out of 17.
"Response:  If you have read 8 books from the series ""The Clumsy, Stupid School"", and there are 14 different books in the series, then you still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
Response:  If there are 62 books and 19 movies in the series, that means we have to find out how many books one person has read if they have seen 34 of the movies. To do this, we can divide the number of movies by the number of books: 34 / 62 = 0.55 or approximately 1/2. So, if you have seen 34 of the movies, you would still need to read 31 more books (62 - 34 = 31).
Response:  If there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series, that means there are 8 + 21 = 39 different media items in total.  If you have read 7 books and seen 4 movies, then you still need to see 39 - 7 - 4 = 28 more media items from the series. Therefore, if you want to watch all the movies in the series, you will need to see 28 more movies.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 movies and 15 books in the series ""The Stupid School"". If we have read 11 books and seen 40 movies, how many more books than movies are there in the series?  To find out, we can use the information given in the question: There are 14 movies and 15 books in the series. So, if we have read 11 books and seen 40 movies, there must be (14 - 11) = 3 more books than movies in the series. Therefore, there are 3 more books than movies in the series ""The Stupid School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""The Dumb and the Ugly School"". If you have read 13 books and seen 63 movies, how many more movies than books are there in the series?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of movies: 63 - 13 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 more movies than books in the series ""The Dumb and the Ugly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series ""The Stupid School"". If you have read 14 of the movies and seen 19 of the books, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than movies as follows:

Books - Movies = Number of More Books Read
= 19 - 10
= 9

So, you have read 9 more books than movies in the series ""The Stupid School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in the series ""The Stupid School"". If you have read 19 of the films and seen 16 of the books, then we can calculate how many more films than books you have seen as follows:

Films - Books = Number of more films than books
= 5 - 16 = 11

So, you have seen 11 more films than books in the series ""The Stupid School""."
Response:  If Dave has won 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 3 tickets for that purpose (since he cannot use more than his total number of tickets). So, the remaining tickets are 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, Dave used 4 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave won some tickets and used 12 of them to buy toys, that means he has 14 - 12 = 2 tickets left. So, Dave won 2 tickets in the slot machine.
Response:  If Dave has won 18 tickets and he used 5 to buy toys and 11 to buy clothes, then he had 8 tickets left after using them (18 - 5 - 11 = 8).
Response:  If Dave won 19 tickets and used 12 to buy toys and 7 to buy clothes, then he has 19 - (12 + 7) = 9 remaining tickets. So, Dave used more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave has won 13 tickets and he used 8 of them to buy toys, then he has 5 remaining tickets (13 - 8 = 5).  Now, if he uses 18 of his remaining tickets to buy clothes, that means he has spent all of his remaining tickets (18 / 5 = 3.6). So, Dave used 3.6 more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left.  If he uses 10 of his remaining tickets to buy toys, then he will have 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Haley had 14 trees in her backyard before the tornado and after the tornado 9 remained standing, then we can say that 5 more trees died than survived. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees in her backyard and after the tornado, 6 of them died. So, we have to find out how many more trees survived than those who died. To do this, we need to subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees planted. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees - Number of dead trees = 13 - 6 = 7
Response:  We know that Haley had 20 trees in her backyard before the tornado. After the tornado, there were left four trees. So, we can deduce that 16 trees died during the tornado (20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Haley had planted some trees in her backyard and after Typhoon 5, 12 trees were left standing, then we can calculate the number of trees that grew using the following formula: Number of trees grown = Total number of trees - Number of trees remaining after the storm / Number of trees remaining before the storm x 100 (%) Where:  Total number of trees = Number of trees planted by Haley (given as 12) - Number of trees remaining after the storm (given as 12) / Number of trees remaining before the storm (not given) x 100 (%) Now, let's plug in the values we know into the formula: Number of trees grown = 12 - 12 /? x 100 (%) Substituting the values, we get: Number of trees grown = 12 - 12 /? x 100 (%) = 12 - 12 /? = 0% Therefore, none of the trees grew during this time period.
"Response: 
Haley initially pruned nine trees in her backyard. After the tornado, four of them died. So she planted five new ones. To find out how many trees Haley has left, we need to subtract the number that died from the total number of trees she had at first. Therefore, the answer is:
Trees remaining = Initial trees - Dead trees = 9 - 4 = 5"
Response:  At first, Haley had 12 trees in her backyard. After the tornado, two of them died. So, she has 12 - 2 = 10 trees left.
Response:  If Haley had started with 3 trees and 13 died in the tornado, then 3 - 13 = -10 trees survived the storm. So, there were 10 more trees that died than survived.
Response:  If Haley had started with 11 trees and 2 died after the tornado, then she has 9 remaining trees. Now, if we assume that each tree lost is proportional to the number of trees present initially (i.e., the probability of a tree dying does not change), then the proportion of dead trees among the initial 11 trees would be the same as the proportion of surviving trees among the remaining 9 trees. So, if 2 out of 11 trees died in the storm, then 4 out of 9 trees also died (since the ratio of dead to alive remains constant). Therefore, there are 7 surviving trees left in Haley's backyard after the tornado.
"Response:  If they harvest 66 sacks per day and each sack contains 28 apples, then we can calculate how many apples are harvested in total per day as follows:

Total number of apples = Number of sacks x Number of apples per sack
= 66 x 28
= 1904 apples/day
Therefore, the farmer harvests 1904 apples every day."
"Response:  If they harvest 8 sacks per day, it will take them x days to harvest 24 sacks of apples. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of days = Number of sacks per day × Number of sacks needed
= 8 × 24
= 192
Therefore, it will take them 192 days to harvest 24 sacks of apples."
"Response:  If Han goes to see the apple harvest every day for four days and they will collect 56 baskets of apples in total, then we can calculate how many baskets they collect each day as follows:

Day 1: 0 baskets (since the harvest hasn't started yet)
Day 2: 14 baskets (since they will collect 56 baskets in total, and there are 4 days left after Day 2)
Day 3: 28 baskets (again, since there are 4 days left after Day 3 and they will collect 56 baskets in total)
Day 4: 30 baskets (since they have collected 30 baskets so far and there is only one day left until the end of the harvest)

Therefore, the answer is:

Han finds out that they will collect 14 + 28 + 30 = 72 baskets of apples per day."
"Response:  If they are harvesting 38 sacks per day and each sack contains 42 apples, then after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of:

38 x 49 = 1762 sacks

So, after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1762 sacks of apples."
"Response:  If they are picking 66 sacks per day and each sack contains 25 apples, then after 87 days of harvest, they will have picked a total of:

66 x 25 = 1650 apples per day

So, in 87 days, they will have picked a total of:

1650 x 87 = 143,500 apples!"
"Response:  If they harvest 8 sacks per day and each sack contains 35 apples, then...

Answer: They harvest 8 x 35 = 280 apples per day."
"Response:  If they harvest 16 sacks per day and each sack contains 57 apples, then in one day they will harvest:

16 x 57 = 902 apples

So, to harvest 80 sacks of apples (which is equal to 80 x 57 = 4480 apples), it would take:

4480 / 902 = 4.9 days

Therefore, it would take approximately 4.9 days to harvest 80 sacks of apples."
Response:  If they harvest 67 sacks of apples per day and each sack contains 12 apples, then they harvest a total of 67 x 12 = 804 apples per day.  If they harvest in total 35 sacks of apples, then they harvest a total of 35 x 12 = 420 apples.
Response:  If they are picking 74 sacks per day and throwing away 71 of them, then after 51 days, they have picked $\boxed{51 \times 74 = 3690}$ sacks of apples and thrown away $\boxed{51 \times 71 = 3615}$ sacks of apples. So, the number of sacks of apples they have after 51 days is $\boxed{3690 - 3615 = 175}$.
"Response:  If they harvest 76 sacks per day and throw away 64 of them, then the number of apples they actually pick is equal to the number of sacks they don't throw away. So we can write an equation as follows:  
$$ \text{Number of apples picked} = \text{Number of sacks not thrown away} $$
We know that 64 sacks are thrown away, so the number of sacks not thrown away is equal to $76 - 64 = 12$. Therefore, the number of apples picked per day is equal to $12 \times 50 = 600$ apples per day."
"Response:  If they pick 28 mature apples and 52 immature apples per day, then after 26 days of harvesting, they will have picked a total of:

Mature apples x Days = Total mature apples
28 x 26 = 704 mature apples

Immature apples x Days = Total immature apples
52 x 26 = 1328 immature apples

Total apples = Mature + Immature
Total apples = 704 + 1328 = 2032 apples"
"Response:  If they pick 82 sacks of mature apples and 61 sacks of unripe apples per day, then after 25 days of harvesting, they will have picked a total of:

82 x 25 = 2050 sacks of mature apples
+ 61 x 25 = 1525 sacks of unripe apples
= Total of 3575 sacks of apples

So, after 25 days of harvesting, they will have picked a total of 3575 sacks of apples."
"Response:  If they are able to collect 31 sacks of mature apples and 24 sacks of unripe apples per day, then after 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of:

31 x 45 = 1365 sacks of mature apples
24 x 45 = 1080 sacks of unripe apples

Therefore, after 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of 2445 sacks of apples (1365 + 1080)."
"Response:  We know that 44 sacks of mature apples are harvested per day and 25 sacks of unripe apples are harvested per day. To find out how many more sacks of mature apples are harvested than unripe apples, we can subtract the number of unripe apples from the total number of apples harvested per day:  
$$ \text {Number of mature apples harvested per day} = 44 \text{ sacks} $$
$$ \text {Number of unripe apples harvested per day} = 25 \text{ sacks} $$
$$ \text {Difference between mature and unripe apples harvested per day} = 44 - 25 = 19 $$
So, $19$ more sacks of mature apples are harvested than unripe apples per day."
Response:  We know that 5 sacks of mature apples are harvested per day and 74 sacks of unripe apples are harvested per day. To find out how many more sacks of unripe apples are harvested than mature apples, we can subtract the number of mature apples from the number of unripe apples:  5 sacks/day - 74 sacks/day = -69 sacks/day This means that 69 fewer sacks of unripe apples are harvested than mature apples per day.
"Response:  If they harvested 54 sacks of apples, and they harvested 18 sacks per day, then it took them:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of sacks}}{\text{Number of sacks per day}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Number of days} &= \frac{54}{18} \\[5pt] &= 3 \end{aligned} $$
Therefore, it took them 3 days to harvest all 54 sacks of apples."
"Response:  If they harvested 56 sacks of apples in total and worked for 14 days, then we can calculate how many sacks they harvested per day as follows:

Total number of sacks = Number of working days x Number of sacks per day
= 14 x?

So, if they harvested 56 sacks of apples in total and worked for 14 days, then they must have harvested 56 / 14 = 4 sacks of apples per day."
Response:  If they are able to hose 5 sacks of mature apples per day and they have been doing this for 73 days, then they have collected 5 x 73 = 365 sacks of mature apples.
"Response:  If they are able to collect 65 unripe apples per day and 46 ripe apples per day, then after 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of:

Unripe apples = 65 x 6 = 390
Ripe apples = 46 x 6 = 276
Total apples = Unripe + Ripe = 390 + 276 = 666
Therefore, after 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 666 sacks of apples, including both unripe and ripe ones."
Response:  We know that 41 unripe apples are harvested per day and 86 ripe apples are harvested per day. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of unripe apples = 41  Number of ripe apples = 86 To find out how many more ripe apples are harvested than unripe apples, we need to subtract the number of unripe apples from the number of ripe apples:  Number of ripe apples - Number of unripe apples = 86 - 41 = 45 Therefore, there are 45 more ripe apples harvested than unripe apples per day.
Response:  We know that han found out they were harvesting 71 unripe apples and 60 ripe apples per day. So, we can write this as an equation: 71 + 60 = x (where x is the number of unripe apples harvested). Now, we are asked to find out how many more unripe apples are harvested than ripe apples. To do this, we subtract the number of ripe apples from the total number of apples harvested: x - 60 = 71. Solving for x, we get x = 91. Therefore, there are 91 more unripe apples harvested than ripe apples per day.
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is given as 4 meters and its width is given as 3 meters. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, we can write: Length - Width = Longer Room... (1) Substituting the values given in the question into equation (1), we get: 4 m - 3 m = 1 m... (2) Simplifying equation (2), we get: 1 m = 1 m... (3) Therefore, Jessie's room is 1 meter longer than it is wide.
"Response:  We know that Jess has a room that is 2 meters long (or 6 feet). If she wants to use a rug with an area of 14 square feet, we can calculate the length and width of the room based on this information.
To do this, we need to convert the length from meters to feet. There are 0.3048 meters in one foot, so:
Length = 2 meters x 0.3048 feet/meter = 0.6096 feet
Now, we have the dimensions of the room: length = 0.6096 feet and width =?
We want the width of the room to be equal to the area of the rug divided by its length. So, we can set up the following equation:
Width = Area of rug / Length of room
Substituting the values we know, we get:
Width = 14 square feet / 0.6096 feet = 22.7 inches or approximately 23 inches
Therefore, the width of Jess's room is approximately 23 inches."
Response:  We know that Jess's room is 2 meters wide (or 200 cm).  A square meter is equal to 100 cm x 100 cm, so one square meter is equal to 10,000 square centimeters. Therefore, we can convert the width of Jess's room from meters to square centimeters as follows:  Room width = 2 m = 200 cm x 100 cm/m = 20,000 cm. Now, let's find out how many square feet are in 14 square meters. One square meter is equal to 10.764 square feet, so we can convert 14 square meters to square feet as follows:  Number of square feet = 14 sq m x 10.764 sq ft/sq m = 153.988 sq ft. Finally, we can calculate the length of Jess's room in square feet by dividing its width in square feet by its length in square feet:  Length of Jess's room = Width of Jess's room / Number of square feet per meter  Length of Jess's room = 20,000 cm / 153.988 sq ft/m = approximately 130.6 feet. So, based on the given information, the length of Jess's room is approximately 130.6 feet or 40 meters.
Response:  We know that Jess has already covered 16 square feet of floor with her tape measure. To cover the entire floor, we need to find out how many square feet are left to cover. The length of the room is 3 meters (or 9.84 feet) and the width is 5 meters (or 16.40 feet). So, the area of the remaining part of the floor can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 9.84 x 16.40 = 162.76 square feet Now, we subtract the area she has already covered from the total area of the floor to find out how much more tape measure she needs: Total area - Covered area = 162.76 - 16 = 146.76 square feet Therefore, Jess needs 146.76 square feet of tape measure to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that Jess' room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If each tile is a square meter, how many tiles will she need to cover the entire floor?  To find out, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length is 2 feet (which is equal to 0.6 meters) and the width is 12 feet (which is equal to 3.6 meters). So, the area of the room is: Area = 0.6 x 3.6 = 2.16 square meters. Since there are 10 square meters in a square meter, we can divide 2.16 by 10 to get the number of square meters needed to cover the entire floor: Number of square meters = 2.16 / 10 = 0.216 square meters. Therefore, Jess will need approximately 0.216 square meters of tiles to cover the entire floor of her room.
Response:  If each room is 6 meters long and 6 meters wide, then the total area of one room is 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since there are 20 rooms in total, the total area of all the rooms is 36 x 20 = 720 square meters. To cover the entire floor with carpeting, Jess will need to buy enough carpet to cover an area of 720 square meters.
Response:  The width of Jess' room is given as 6 meters and its length is also given as 6 meters. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, we can write: Length = Width + (Length - Width) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Length = 6m + (6m - 6m) Simplifying, we get: Length = 0 m Which means that Jess' room is not longer or shorter than it is wide.
"Response:  We know that Jesse has to use a rug of size 3 square meters for her room. Since her room is 1.5 meters long, we can find out the width of the rug as follows:

Width = Length x Area per Meter
= 1.5 meters x 3 square meters / 10 meters (conversion factor)
= 4.5 meters

Therefore, the width of the rug is approximately 4.5 meters."
Response:  We know that Jesse has a room of 3 square meters and it is 2 feet wide (or 60 inches). So we can calculate the length of her room as follows: Length = Width x Area / Square Meters Length = 2 ft x 3 sqm / 1 m^2 Length = 60 in / 0.9144 m Length = approximately 65.78 inches or 167 cm Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 167 cm or 65.78 inches.
Response:  The room is four feet long and six feet wide, so it has an area of 4 x 6 = 24 square feet. Since Jesse has 6 square meters of carpet, we can convert this to square feet by multiplying by 0.1 (since there are 0.1 square meters in one square foot). So, 6 square meters = 0.6 square feet. Now, we need to find out how much of the floor needs to be covered with carpet. To do this, we divide the total area of the room by the amount of space that will be covered with carpet: 24 square feet / 0.6 square feet per meter = 40 square feet. Therefore, Jesse should use approximately 40 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.
Response:  We know that they sold $ 23 per shirt and made $ 230 in total from both games. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of shirts = Total amount earned / Price per shirt. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of shirts = $ 230 / $ 23 = 10 shirts. Therefore, they sold 10 shirts.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling 3 T-shirts is $51. If each T-shirt costs $20, then we can calculate the cost of each T-shirt as follows: Cost = Total Revenue / Number of T-shirts = $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $17.
Response:  We know that they sold $87 per shirt and they sold in total 95 shirts during both games. So, if they sold 47 shirts during Arkansas game, then they earned $409 ($87 x 47) dollars.
Response:  We know that they sold $106 per shirt during the Arkansas game and $106 x 2 = $212 for both games combined. So, if they sold 115 shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 242 - 115 = 127 shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  We know that they sold 163 T-shirts in total during both games. If they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then we can find out how much money they made from each T-shirt by dividing the total amount of money earned from T-shirt sales by the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game: $$ = \frac {163}{89} = 1.85$$ So, they made $1.85 per T-shirt sold during the Arkansas game.
Response:  We know that they sold $78 per shirt during the Arkansas game and $186 in total for both games combined. So if they sold x shirts during the Arkansas game, then we can set up an equation as follows:  $78x = 186 Total T-Shirt Sales$ / 2 Games$  Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem statement:  x = 172 (since they sold 172 shirts during the Arkansas game)Now, we can solve for $78x : $78x = 186Total T-Shirt Sales$/2 Games$$78x = 186 \times 2 = 372$So, they earned $372 in revenue from selling T-shirts during the two games.
Response:  We know that Razorback-butikken sold 183 T-shirts and 31 sweatshirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game. According to the information provided in the question, each T-shirt costs $62, while each sweatshirt costs $99. So, we can calculate how much money Razorback-butikken made from selling these items as follows:  For T-shirts: Total number of T-shirts sold = 183 T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = $62 per T-shirt Total amount earned from T-shirts = Total number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt = $11,406 (round off to $11,400) For sweatshirts: Total number of sweatshirts sold = 31 sweatshirts x Price per sweatshirt = $99 per sweatshirt Total amount earned from sweatshirts = Total number of sweatshirts sold x Price per sweatshirt = $3,079 (round off to $3,080) Therefore, Razorback-butikken earned a total of $14,485 ($11,400 + $3,080) from selling T-shirts and sweatshirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
"Response:  We know that Razorback-butikken sold $67 per T-shirt and $165 per jersey. During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 jerseys. So, we can calculate how much money they made from each item as follows:
T-shirts: 74 x $67 = $4934
Jerseys: 156 x $165 = $25,840
Therefore, Razorback-butikken made a total of $29,774 from selling both T-shirts and jerseys during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game."
Response:  We know that the razorback-butikken sells each T-shirt for $ 192 and each sweatshirt for $ 34.  During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 sweaters. To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a sweater, we can use the following formula: Difference = Selling price of T-shirt - Selling price of sweater. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Difference = $ 192 - $ 34 = $ 158. Therefore, a T-shirt costs $ 158 more than a sweater.
Response:  We know that the razorback store sells $86 per T-shirt and $232 per jersey.  During the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys. To find out how much more a jersey costs than a T-shirt, we can subtract the price of a T-shirt from the price of a jersey: $232 - $86 = $146. So, a jersey costs $146 more than a T-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each t-shirt is sold for $51. So, if they sold x t-shirts, they earned $x \* $51 = 51x dollars.  Now, in the second part of the question, it says that under Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. So, the total amount of money they earned from these t-shirts is 51(130) = 6430 dollars. Therefore, the answer is 6430 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each Razorback t-shirt is sold for $201. In addition, during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the price of each t-shirt increased by $217. Therefore, the total amount earned from selling t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Amount = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt + (Increase in Price x Number of T-shirts) Total Amount = 14 x $201 + ($217 x 14) Total Amount = $28,560 + $3,098 Total Amount = $31,658 So, the answer is $31,658.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned by the Razorback T-shirt store is $60 and they sold T-shirts for $10 each. So we can write an equation based on this information as follows:  Total Amount Earned = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price per T-Shirt  In this case, we are asked to find out how many T-shirts were sold. To do this, we need to isolate the variable ""Number of T-Shirts Sold"" on one side of the equation.  We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the price per T-shirt ($10):  Number of T-Shirts Sold = Total Amount Earned / Price per T-Shirt  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:  Number of T-Shirts Sold = $60 / $10  Number of T-Shirts Sold = 6  Therefore, the Razorback T-shirt store sold 6 T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech."
Response:  We know that the butikken sold 5 T-shirts and earned $215 in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total amount of money = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt. In this case, we are given that the price per T-shirt is $40 (since each T-shirt costs $40). Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation and solve for the number of T-shirts: Number of T-shirts = Total amount of money / Price per T-shirt. Substituting the values we were given, we get: Number of T-shirts = $215 / $40. Simplifying and solving for the number of T-shirts, we find that there were 5 T-shirts sold: Number of T-shirts = $215 / $40 = 5. Therefore, each T-shirt cost $40.
Response:  We know that Razorback-butikken sold $215 worth of T-shirts and $5 x 64 = $320 worth of jerseys during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game. So altogether they made $535 from these sales.
Response:  We know that Razorback-butikken sold $76 per jersey and $204 per T-shirt. During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 2 T-shirts and 3 jerseys. So, we can calculate how much money they made from each item as follows:  For T-shirts: $204 x 2 = $408 For jerseys: $76 x 3 = $228 Total amount of money earned from both items: $408 + $228 = $636 Therefore, Razorback-butikken earned $636 from selling those 2 T-shirts and 3 jerseys during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling T-shirts and jerseys is $210 x 177 = $36,970 for T-shirts and $240 x 23 = $5,380 for jerseys. So, the difference between the cost of a T-shirt and a jersey is: $36,970 - $5,380 = $31,590. Therefore, a T-shirt costs $31,590 / 177 = $180 more than a jersey.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling shirts and jerseys is $115 for each jersey and $25 for each T-shirt. So, if they sold 78 jerseys and 113 T-shirts, then the total amount of money earned from these sales would be:

$115 x 78 = $9030 (for jerseys)
$25 x 113 = $2725 (for T-shirts)
Total amount of money earned = $9030 + $2725 = $11755
So, to find out how much more a jersey costs than a T-shirt, we can subtract the amount earned from selling T-shirts ($2725) from the amount earned from selling jerseys ($9030):

$9030 - $2725 = $6305
Therefore, a jersey costs $6305 more than a T-shirt."
Response:  If they have five sets of tables and ten chairs in each set, then the total number of tables is 5 x 10 = 50 tables. Since there are more chairs than tables, that means there are more than 50 chairs. So, the answer is 50 or more chairs.
Response:  If there are 12 chairs in the backyard and they want to seat two sets of guests with equal number of seats, then each set will have 6 chairs. So, there will be 6 chairs at each table.
Response:  If there are 9 chairs in the backyard and they have sets of 3 chairs each, then we can calculate the number of sets as follows: Number of sets = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per set = 9 chairs / 3 chairs per set = 3 sets So, they have 3 sets of chairs in their backyard.
Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and chairs in their backyard, that means they have 11 x 13 = 143 chairs in total. So, if they have 13 chairs per group, then they must have 143 / 13 = 10 groups or circles of chairs in their backyard.
Response:  If there are 11 people sitting on chairs and each set of tables has 6 chairs, then we can calculate the number of empty chairs as follows: Number of empty chairs = Total number of people - (Number of sets x Number of chairs per set) In this case, the total number of people is 11, and the number of sets is 10. So, we need to subtract the product of these two numbers from 11: Number of empty chairs = 11 - (10 x 6) = 5 Therefore, there are 5 empty chairs at the party.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Additionally, there are six extra chairs. So, the total number of chairs for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If there are 14 guests attending the party and each set of tables has 3 chairs, then we need to find out how many sets of tables are needed. Since there are 4 sets of tables available, we can divide 14 by 4 to get the number of sets required: 14 / 4 = 3.5 sets. So, they will need 3.5 sets of tables.
Response:  If they have 9 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs, then we can calculate as follows: Number of chairs = Total number of tables x Number of chairs per table So, in this case, the total number of chairs is: Number of chairs = 9 x 14 = 126 chairs Therefore, they have more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Lewis earns $460 in 5 weeks of harvest, he will have earned... (insert calculation here)
"Response:  If Lewis earns $16 per week during autumn, and he has earned a total of $1216 in autumn, then we can calculate how many weeks autumn lasted as follows:

$1216 / $16 = x weeks

x = 78 weeks (rounded to nearest whole number)

Therefore, autumn lasted for 78 weeks."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks in the fall season and has to pay $702 in taxes, we can calculate his remaining amount as follows:

Remaining Amount = Total Earnings - Taxes Paid
= $21 x 216 weeks
- $702

So, at the end of the fall season, Lewis will have $593 left ($21 x 216 weeks - $702)."
Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks of an autumn season, he will have earned total amount of money equal to:  $$ Total = \times 223 weeks = $1357 x 223 = $294,610$$ Therefore, if he works in 73 harvest seasons, he will have earned a total amount of money equal to:  $$Total = \times 73 seasons = $294,610 x 73 = $20,833,300$$
Response:  If Lewis earns $28 per week during the 109 weeks of harvest and also earns $939 overtime pay each week, his total weekly income can be calculated as follows: Total weekly income = Regular wage + Overtime pay = $28 + $939 = $967 per week Now, to find out how much he earned in the entire harvest period, we need to multiply his total weekly income by the number of weeks in the harvest period: Total income in harvest period = Total weekly income x Number of weeks in harvest period = $967 x 109 = $104,533 So, Lewis earned $104,533 in the entire harvest period.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week during the 23 weeks of harvest season and he pays $49 in rent each week, then his total income for the harvest season is:

Total income = Number of weeks x Weekly income
= 23 x $403
= $8,690
Therefore, Lewis will have earned $8,690 during the harvest season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks with summer, and he has to pay $388 rent per week during that time period, then we can calculate his total rent payment as follows: Total rent paid = Number of weeks x Rent per week = 1359 x $388 = $507,420 So, Lewis pays $507,420 in rent during the summer season.
Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks with fall season and he has to pay $216 rent every week, then at the end of the fall season, he will have how much money? So let's calculate it! Total amount earned = Number of weeks x Weekly income = 1181 x $491 = $573,091 Total amount paid = Rent per week x Number of weeks = $216 x 1181 = $249,766 Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount earned, and we get the remaining balance or savings. Remaining balance = Total amount earned - Total amount paid = $573,091 - $249,766 = $323,325 Therefore, at the end of the fall season, Lewis will have $323,325 in his bank account.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $19 per hour and works for 13 hours in a week, his total weekly income is:  
$19 x 13 = $257  
So, Lewis earns $257 per week."
Response:  If Lewis earns $178 in total during høsten and he works for 4 weeks, then his weekly income is:  $178 / 4 = $44 per week.
"Response:  If water is 10 times deeper than Dean is tall and he stands at 9 feet, then we can calculate how deep the water is compared to Dean's height as follows:

Water depth = Dean's height x 10
= 9 ft x 10
= 90 ft

Therefore, the water is 90 feet deep compared to Dean's height of 9 feet."
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to take a swim. The depth of water is two times Dean's height. Since Dean is shorter than Ron, we can say that Ron stands in 4 meters deep water if Dean stands in 8 meters deep water. So, the depth of water is 8 meters.
Response:  We know that Ron is three meters shorter than Dean and that the depth of water is five times Ron's height. So if Ron stands at 12 feet (3.6 meters) high, then the depth of the water would be 5 x 3.6 = 18 feet (5.4 meters).
Response:  We know that Dean is $1$ meter higher than Ron, so Dean's height is $Dean=Ron+1$.  Since they decided to take a swim after resting, we can say that their position was $(4)$ meters below the surface of the water initially.  Now, since the depth of the water is $15$ times the height of Dean, we can write $\text{water depth} = 15\times \text{height of Dean}$.  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get $\text{water depth} = 15\times (Ron+1) = 15\times Ron + 15$.  Solving for $\text{water depth}$, we get $\text{water depth} = 22.5$ meters.
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to take a swim. The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Since Dean is three meters higher than Ron, we can say that Dean is 3 x 16 = 48 meters above the water level. If Ron stands on 4 meters above sea level, then the depth of the water would be 48 - 4 = 44 meters deep.
Response:  We know that Ron is 5 meters tall and Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron, so Dean is 3 meters tall (since he is 2 meters shorter). Now we are told that the depth of the water is nine times Ron's height, which means it is 45 meters deep (9 x 5 = 45). So, the water was 45 meters deep.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among two shelves, then each shelf will have Books = 34 / 2 = 17 books.
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf contains two books, then he must have:

$ Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf $
= 42 / 2 $
= 21 shelves $
Therefore, Brian has 21 shelves."
Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each book is placed on one of his 23 shelves, then he will have 27/23 = 11 books left over after placing all 27 books on the shelves. Similarly, if he has 80 sheets for each of his 23 shelves, then he will have 80 x 23 = 1920 sheets in total. So, Brian has 11 + 1920 = 1931 books in total.
"Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book contains 46 pages (blades), then he has a total of:

9 x 46 = 424 pages or blades in his books."
Response:  If Brian has 23 books and each book is placed on one of his 29 shelves, then he will have 23/29 = 0.79 books per shelf. Similarly, if he has 61 sheets for each of his 29 shelves, then he will have 61/29 = 2.17 sheets per shelf. Therefore, in total, Brian has 0.79 x 29 = 22.53 books and 2.17 x 29 = 64.83 sheets.
Response:  We know that Brian has seven bookshelves with an equal number of books on each shelf. Therefore, he has 7 x 28 = 196 books in total. Since there are 7 bookshelves, we can divide the total number of books by 7 to find out how many books are in each shelf: 196 books / 7 bookshelves = 28 books per shelf. So, there are 28 books in each of Brian's seven bookshelves.
Response:  If Brian has 38 books in total and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then he has 38 / 2 = 19 bookshelves.
"Response:  If Carol sends out birthday invitations to ten friends and each package of invitations she bought had 2 invitations in it, then we can find out how many packages she needs to buy without forgetting any friends as follows:

Number of friends = 10 (the number of friends she wants to invite)
Total number of invitations needed = Number of friends x Number of invitations per package
= 10 x 2 (since each package has 2 invitations)
= 20 invitations total

So, Carol needs to buy at least 2 packages of invitations to make sure she doesn't forget any of her friends."
Response:  If Carol sent out birthday invitations to 12 friends and bought three packs of the same number of invitations, then there must be 12 x 3 = 36 invitations in total. So, each pack contains 36/3 = 12 invitations.
Response:  If Carol sends out 7 packages of invitations each containing 10 invitations for a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations in all, and she only sends invitations to two friends, then there are 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over that she did not send to anyone.
Response:  We know that Carol sent out birthday party invitations to her friends in packages of 14 each. She bought 6 packages, so she invited a total of 84 people (6 x 14 = 84). Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number of guests she can invite to 95 (84 + 11 = 95). Therefore, the answer is 95.
Response:  If Carol sends out birthday party invitations to her friends and each package contains 3 invitations, then she needs to buy $3 \times 2 = 6$ packages of invitations if she wants to invite 9 friends in total. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she scored 36 total points, then she must have played x number of games where x = 36 / 12 = 3. So, Melissa played 3 games.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 81 points in total and scored the same amount for each game, then she must have scored x points per game. Since there were 3 games, we can write an equation as follows:
x + x + x = 81... (1)
Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many points Melissa scored in each game. We can do this by adding the three expressions inside the parentheses:
x + x + x = 81... (1)
x + x + x = 81... (2)
Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:
x = 27
So, Melissa scored 27 points in each of her 3 games."
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each game and got 82 bonus points in each game. So her total score per game is: Total score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now we are asked how many points she scored in 79 games. To find this out, we can multiply her total score per game by the number of games she played: Points scored = Total score x Number of games = 191 x 79 = 14699 points. Therefore, Melissa scored 14699 points in 79 games.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points per game. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game Now, we are asked to find out how many games Melissa played. Therefore, we need to solve for the variable 'Number of games'. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total score = (Number of games) x (7 points/game)  Simplifying the equation, we get: Total score = 7(Number of games)  Since Melissa scored 21 points in total, we can set up another equation: 21 = 7(Number of games) Solving for the variable 'Number of games', we get: Number of games = 3  Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and she scored the same number of points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: Total score = Number of games x Points per game So if we know that Melissa played 13 games, we can substitute this value into our equation to solve for the number of points she scored in each game: Total score = Number of games x Points per game = 13 x 91 = 1123 points Therefore, Melissa scored 1123 points in each game.
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the gyrocopter and 20 people can ride at the same time, then we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many people can sit on each seat. So, the answer is 5 (20 / 4).
Response:  If we have one big wheel in Paradise Park with seats that can accommodate 9 people each and if 18 people can ride on it at the same time, then we need to find out how many seats are available for those 18 riders. So, the number of seats available = Number of riders x Number of seats per rider. Therefore, the answer is:  Seats available = 18 x 9 = 162 seats.
Response:  We know that each Pariserhjul in Paradise Park has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, we need to find out how many people can ride on all 20 Pariserhjul at once. To do this, we multiply the number of seats per Pariserhjul (19) by the number of Pariserhjul available for riding (20):  Number of people who can ride = Seats per Pariserhjul x Number of Pariserhjul available = 19 x 20 = 380 people. So, 380 people can ride on 20 Pariserhjul at the same time.
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in the gondola and each seat can hold 15 people, then the total capacity of the gondola is:

18 seats x 15 people per seat = 270 people

If 10 seats are damaged, then the remaining seats available for use are:

270 - 10 = 260 people

Therefore, if 10 seats are damaged, up to 260 people can ride on the Ferris wheel at the same time."
"Response:  If there are currently 16 people on the Ferris wheel (Guldhjulet) in Paradise Park and it has six seats, then we can calculate how many more people can fit on it as follows:

Number of available seats = Number of current riders x Number of seats per ride
= 16 x 14
= 224

Therefore, there are 224 additional people who can fit on the Ferris wheel if all the current riders were to leave at once."
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the Danish gyratory at Paradise Park. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, and each large seat can accommodate 54 people. So, if we divide the total number of seats (2 + 23 = 25) by the number of small seats (2), we get the number of people who can ride on the small seats: 25 / 2 = 12. Therefore, 12 people can ride on the small seats of the Danish gyratory at Paradise Park.
Response:  We know that there are 7 big seats and each of them can accommodate 12 people, so we have 7 x 12 = 84 people who can ride on the big seats. Now, let's consider how many people can ride on the small seats. There are 3 small seats and each of them can accommodate 16 people, so we have 3 x 16 = 48 people who can ride on the small seats. Therefore, in total, we have 84 + 48 = 132 people who can ride on Pariserhjulet at Paradise Park.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride on the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park simultaneously and it has 4 seats per car, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many cars can fit on the Ferris wheel at once. So, the answer is 4.
"Response:  If we have X number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time and each seat on the Ferris wheel can hold two people, then we can calculate the total number of seats as follows:
X = Number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time
2 = Number of people that can sit in each seat on the Ferris wheel
Therefore, the total number of seats on the Ferris wheel is:
Total Seats = X x 2
= (Number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time) x (Number of people that can sit in each seat on the Ferris wheel)
So, if 10 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, and each seat can hold 2 people, then there are 20 seats on the Ferris wheel."
Response:  If we have ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then there are 7 x Number of slices in one pizza = Total number of slices in all pizzas.  Since there were 14 slices in total, we can set up an equation as follows: 7x + 0 = 14.  Solving for x (the number of slices in each pizza), we get: x = 2. So, each pizza has 2 slices.
"Response:  If there were 28 slices in total and each pizza had two slices, then we would have ordered:

28 / 2 = 14 pizzas

So, we would have ordered 14 pizzas."
"Response:  If we ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices in all 17 pizzas.
Total number of slices = Number of pizzas x Number of slices per pizza
= 17 x 4
= 68 slices

So there are 68 slices in all 17 pizzas."
Response:  If we ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then if we divide them equally among ourselves (2 people), we will get 45 slices of pizza in total.
"Response:  If they have sowed 10 seeds in each of the 45 flower beds, then the total number of seeds sowed is:

45 x 10 = 450 seeds

Therefore, they have sowed 450 seeds."
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 45 seeds in 9 flower beds, then they must have planted an equal number of seeds (i.e., 5) in each flower bed. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total.  Since only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each bed, we can say that there are 58/36 = 1.6 frames per bed. So, if they had x beds, then the number of frames would be x \* 1.6 = 1.6x. Therefore, the number of beds is 1.6x.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds in total.  Since they only got 60 flowers to grow from each of the 15 seed beds, we can calculate how many seed beds they had as follows: Number of seed beds = Total number of seeds / Number of flowers grown per seed bed = 55 / 60 = 9 seed beds So, Paige and her mother planted 9 seed beds with 15 seeds in each.
Response:  If they planted 60 seeds in total and each bed has 10 seeds, then the number of beds is: 60 / 10 = 6. So, they had 6 blomsterbeds.
"Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 32 seeds in total, and they divided them equally among 8 flower beds, then each flower bed received:

$$ \text {Number of seeds in each flower bed} = \frac{\text{Total number of seeds}}{ \text{Number of flower beds}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of seeds in each flower bed}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 } $$
Therefore, Paige and her mother planted $4$ seeds in each of the $8$ flower beds."
Response:  If Matthew had some cookies and gave two cookies to each of his 11 friends, then he would have given away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 cookies. So, Matthew had 22 - 2 = 20 cookies left originally.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 kicks and gave two kicks to each of his friends, then he would have given away 2 x 8 = 16 kicks in total. So, he gave kicks to 4 friends (since there are 4 options).
Response:  If Matthew had 15 cookies and gave an equal number of cookies to each of his 5 friends, then he would have given away 3 times as many cookies (15 / 5 = 3). So now Matthew has 10 cookies left, which means each friend got 3 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 kicks and gave an equal number of kicks to his 3 friends, then he would have given away 8 kicks (since 24 / 3 = 8). So now, Matthew has 16 kicks left (24 - 8 = 16). Then, if he gives away 5 more kicks to his friends, he will be left with 11 kicks (16 - 5 = 11). Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 kicks and gave an equal number to his 11 friends, then he would have given them 22 / 11 = 2 kicks each. So, his 11 friends together received 2 x 11 = 22 kicks.
Response:  If Matthew had 29 kicks and gave an equal number of kicks and cakes to his two friends, then he would have given 14.5 kicks (29 / 2) and 14.5 cakes (30 / 2). So, his two friends would have eaten 14.5 cakes each.
"Response:  If Matthew had 14 cookies and 21 cakes, and he gave an equal number of each to his 7 friends, then the number of cookies and cakes given to each friend is:

Cookies: 14 / 7 = 2 per friend
Cakes: 21 / 7 = 3 per friend
So, each of Matthew's 7 friends received 2 cookies and 3 cakes in total."
"Response:  If Matthew gave out many kicks to his 18 friends, then he must have had some amount of kicks left over after giving them all away. So let's call that amount ""x"". Since there are 18 friends and each friend got ""x"" kicks, we can write an equation: x + (x \* 18) = 36. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 36. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 18. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his 18 friends 18 kicks."
Response:  If Matthew gave 4 small bagels to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 4 x 5 = 20 small bagels to all his friends together. Since there were 36 kicks in total, and Matthew gave out 20 small bagels, that means he had 36 - 20 = 16 small bagels left over for himself.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 kicks and gave away an equal number of kicks to each of his two friends, then he must have given 23/2 = 11 kicks to each friend. So, each friend got 11 kicks.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 kicks and gave away an equal number of kicks to his friends. So he has 23 kicks left after giving them away. Therefore, the number of kicks he gave away is equal to 31 - 23 = 8.
"Response:  If Matthew gave out ""lige mange"" (a lot) of cookies and cakes to his 4 friends, then we can assume that he gave each friend an equal number of both cookies and cakes.  Therefore, if he had 32 cookies and 98 cakes in total, then each friend would have received:

Cookies: 32 / 4 = 8 cookies per friend
Cakes: 98 / 4 = 24 cakes per friend"
"Response:  If Matthew gave out ""ligelige mange"" (a lot) of cookies and cakes to his 4 friends, then we can assume that he had more than enough for all of them. So let's say he had 20 cookies and 16 cakes in total. Then each friend would have received:

Cookies: 20 / 4 = 5 cookies per friend
Cakes: 16 / 4 = 4 cakes per friend
Therefore, each friend got 5 cookies and 4 cakes."
"Response:  If Matthew gave out ""lige mange"" (a lot of) candies and cookies to his 28 friends, then we can assume that he had more than enough for all of them. So let's say he had x candies and y cookies in total. Since there are 28 friends, each friend got a fraction of the total amount of candies and cookies. We know from the problem statement that Matthew had 13 candies and 15 cookies at the beginning, so if we divide these numbers equally among the 28 friends, each friend would get:
x/28 = 13
y/28 = 15
Now we have two equations:
x/28 = 13
y/28 = 15
Can you solve for x and y?"
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought water bottles when they were on sale and she drank 109 bottles per day. If each bottle lasted for 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she had purchased as follows:

Number of bottles = Total number of days / Number of bottles used per day
= 74 days / 109 bottles/day
= 6.85 bottles (round up to nearest whole number)
Therefore, Debbie had purchased approximately 7 bottles."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 water bottles when they were on sale and she drank the same number of bottles each day. If the bottles lasted for 17 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she drank per day as follows:

Number of bottles = Total number of bottles / Number of days
= 153 / 17
= 9

So, Debbie drank 9 bottles of water each day."
"Response:  If she bought 264 water bottles and drank 15 per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many are left as follows:

Total number of bottles drunk = Number of bottles drunk per day x Number of days
= 15 bottles/day x 11 days
= 165 bottles (rounded to nearest whole number)

So, Debbie has 165 bottles left."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 water bottles and drank 144 per day for some days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of days = 301 / 144 = 2

Therefore, Debbie has been drinking water from those 301 bottles for 2 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 88 water bottles and 13 soda bottles in total. If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles per day, we can calculate how many days they will last as follows:

Number of water bottles = 4/day x 88 bottles = 340 bottles (Debbie will use up all the water bottles in approximately 340 days)

Number of soda bottles = 87/day x 13 bottles = 1091 bottles (Debbie will use up all the soda bottles in approximately 1091 days)

Therefore, the water bottles will last for approximately 340 days, while the soda bottles will last for approximately 1091 days."
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles when they were on sale. If she drinks 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles per day, how many days will the soda bottles last?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of soda bottles by the number of bottles she drinks per day: Number of days = Total number of soda bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day  In this case, the total number of soda bottles is 256, and the number of bottles drunk per day is 4. So, we can calculate the number of days as follows: Number of days = 256 / 4 = 64 days  Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 64 days if Debbie continues to drink at the same rate.
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and buys 12 bottles, then she will have enough water for how many days?  To find out, we need to divide the number of bottles she has (12) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (6). So, if Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and buys 12 bottles, then she will have enough water for 2 days.
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 water bottles. If she drinks 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles per day, we can calculate how many days they will last her as follows:

Days = (Number of bottles / Number of bottles consumed per day) x Total number of days
= (95 / 15) x 30
= 62.5 days
Therefore, the water bottles will last Debbie for approximately 62.5 days, assuming she continues to consume at the same rate."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 water bottles. If she drinks 122 water bottles per day, then we can calculate how many days the remaining water bottles will last her as follows:

Days = Total number of water bottles / Number of water bottles consumed per day
= 162 / 122
= 1.34 days

So, the remaining water bottles will last Debbie approximately 1.34 days. As for the soda, since Debbie only drank 9 soda bottles in one day, it means that the remaining soda bottles will last her for an infinite amount of time, since there are no further consumption values given in the question."
Response:  If Faye placed her 15 blyants in 14 rows with 11 blyants in each row, then we can calculate the total number of blyants as follows: Total number of blyants = Number of rows x Number of blyants in each row Total number of blyants = 14 x 11 = 154 Blyants So, Faye has 154 blyants in total.
Response:  If Faye placed 12 balls in 3 rows, then she must have placed 4 balls in each row (since there are 3 rows). So, the number of balls that Faye placed in each row is 4.
Response:  We know that Faye had 28 packets of blyants with each packet containing 24 blyants. Therefore, in total she had 28 x 24 = 672 blyants. Since we are asked how many rows she could make with her blyants, we need to divide the total number of blyants by the number of blyants in one row. So, if there are n rows, then the number of blyants in each row is 672 / n. Now we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by 672 and simplifying: n = 672 / 672 = 1. Therefore, Faye could make only one row of blyants.
Response:  We know that Faye has six packets of bait with 14 baits in each packet. Therefore, she has 6 x 14 = 84 bait altogether. However, we are asked how many bait does she have in total. So, let's add up all the numbers: 84 + 84 + 84 + 84 + 84 + 84 = 504 bait.  Therefore, Faye has 504 bait in total.
Response:  If Faye has 35 blyanters and she wants to arrange them in rows of five each, then she will need at least 7 rows (since there are 7 different colors). So, the number of rows that Faye can make is 7.
Response:  We know that Faye placed her stamps in 19 rows with 4 stamps and 27 colored stamps in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of stamps as follows: Number of stamps = Total number of rows x Number of stamps per row = 19 x 4 = 76 stamps In addition to these 76 stamps, there are also 27 colored stamps for each row, which makes it a total of 27 x 19 = 503 colored stamps. Therefore, the total number of stamps including both plain and colored ones is 76 + 503 = 579 stamps.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her sticks in seven rows with 36 sticks and 30 colored sticks in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of colored sticks as follows: Number of colored sticks = Total number of sticks x Number of colored sticks per row = 36 x 30 = 1080 colored sticks Therefore, Faye has 1080 farvebleke (colored sticks).
Response:  We know that Faye placed her stamps in 11 rows with 31 stamps and 27 colored stamps in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of stamps as follows: Total number of stamps = Number of rows x Number of stamps per row + Number of colored stamps per row x Number of rows Therefore, the total number of stamps is equal to:  Total number of stamps = 11 x 31 + 27 x 11 = 341 + 3075 = 3425 stamps In conclusion, Faye has 3425 stamps in all.
Response:  If Faye has 30 blyanters and wants to arrange them in rows of 5 each, she can make 6 rows (30 / 5 = 6). So, the answer is 6 rows.
Response:  If Faye had six blyanters and she placed them in two rows of three each, then the number of blyants placed in each row is 3. Therefore, the answer is (3, 3).
Response:  We know that Faye had 35 packets of pens with four pens in each packet. So, she had a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pens. Now, we need to find out how many rows or layers can be made using these pens. To do this, we divide the number of pens by two, since there are two pens in each row or layer. Therefore, the number of rows or layers that Faye could make is 140 / 2 = 70 rows or layers.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packets of pens with her and each packet contains 6 pens. So, in total she has 31 x 6 = 186 pens.   
Response:  We know that Faye placed her sticks and pencils in 30 rows with 71 sticks and 24 sticks in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of sticks as follows: Total number of sticks = Number of rows x Number of sticks per row = 30 x 71 = 2130 sticks And for pencils, we have: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 30 x 24 = 720 pencils Therefore, Faye has 2130 sticks and 720 pencils in total.
Response:  We know that Faye placed her sticks in 16 rows with 6 sticks and 21 sticks in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of sticks as follows: Total number of sticks = Number of rows x Number of sticks per row = 16 x 6 + 16 x 21 = 356 + 376 = 732 sticks. Therefore, Faye has 732 farbeblekes.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 15-20 students (depending on the size of the bus), we have: Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 98 / 7 = 14 Students per bus. Therefore, there are 14 students per bus.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 buses full of students (118 seats per bus). So we can write an equation using these values: Number of students = Total number of classrooms x Number of students per bus  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Number of students = 84 x 118  Number of students = 10,272 Now, let's simplify the calculation: 10,272 = 84 x 118  To find out how many students are at the school, divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: Number of students = 10,272 / 84  Number of students = 1236 Therefore, there are approximately 1236 students at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and 66 students per classroom, so we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4258 students in the school. Since there are six seats available on each bus, we need to divide the number of students by six to find out how many buses will be needed: 4258 / 6 = 709. Therefore, four buses (or 710 students) will be needed to take the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students per classroom, so there are 87 x 58 = 4912 students in total. Since each student needs two seats on the bus, we need 4912 / 2 = 2456 seats on the buses. Therefore, there will be 2456 / 2 = 1228 bus riders.
Response:  We know that there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students as there are seats in the school buses (84). So we can set up an equation based on this information: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of classes = 120 / 84 = 3.   Therefore, there are 3 classes in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total at the school and 8 seats available per bus. So if 22 students do not want to go on the trip, we need to find out how many buses will be needed to accommodate all the remaining students. To do this, we can divide the number of remaining students (i.e., 80 = 102 - 22) by the number of seats available per bus (i.e., 8). Therefore, the answer is 10 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. We also know that each bus can hold 99 students. If 8 students do not want to go on the trip, then we need to find out how many students will actually go on the trip. So, let X be the number of students who will go on the trip. According to the problem statement, X = 102 - 8 = 94. Therefore, 94 students will go on the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and three seats per bus. So we need to divide the number of students (111) by the number of seats per bus (3). Therefore, the answer is: 111 / 3 = 37 buses needed for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 92 students in total and we have 46 school buses. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 17 students (as mentioned in the problem), then: Number of seats per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 92 / 46 = 2 So, there are 2 seats available in each bus.
"Response:  If there are 11 boys and each boy gets 9 balls from Haley, then the total number of balls given out is:

11 boys x 9 balls per boy = 99 balls in total

So, Haley gave away 99 balls to the 11 boys."
Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and she gave 5 balls to each of 5 boys, then she gave a total of 5 x 5 = 25 balls away. So, there are 10 - 25 = 15 balls left with Haley.
Response:  If Haley has 23 balls and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she will have 8 balls left (23 - 15 = 8). Now, if there are 4 boys in her class who love playing marbles, each boy will get how many marbles from Haley's remaining 8 balls? To find out, we can divide 8 balls by 4 boys, which gives us 2 balls per boy (8 / 4 = 2). So, each of the 4 boys will get 2 marbles from Haley.
Response:  If Haley has 26 kuglers and 13 boys like to play with kuglers, then she can give each boy 2 kuglers (since there are 26 total). So, 13 boys will get 2 kuglers each = 26 kuglers given out. Now, if 50 boys like to play cards, how many cards can they get? Since there are only 26 kuglers available, we need to divide the number of boys who want to play cards by the number of kuglers available. In this case, 50 boys / 26 kuglers = 2 cards per boy. Therefore, all 50 boys will get 2 cards each.
Response:  If Haley has 20 balls and her classmates love playing ball, if she divides them equally, then how many will each of her classmates get? So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of balls = Total number of classmates / Number of classmates who will receive one ball. In this case, total number of classmates is 20 (since there are 20 balls), and number of classmates who will receive one ball is 1 (since Haley has already divided the balls). Therefore, we can solve for the number of balls each classmate gets by dividing 20 by 1: Each classmate gets 20/1 = 20 balls.
Response:  If Haley has 28 kugler and she gives 2 kuglers to each of 14 boys, then she gave away a total of 2 x 14 = 28 kuglers. So, the correct answer is 28.
"Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book for x days and he read 14 pages per day. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x = (Total number of pages in the book) / (Number of pages read per day)
In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 392, and Frank read 14 pages per day. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for x:
x = 392 / 14
x = 27
So, it took Frank 27 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Number of pages = Total days of reading / Daily reading pages Therefore, the number of pages in the book is: Number of pages = 569 days / 22 pages/day = 25,714 pages In conclusion, there are approximately 25,714 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took six days to finish reading his favorite book. So, he read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the number of pages (612) by the time taken (six days):  Number of hours = Number of pages / Time taken  Number of hours = 612 / 6  Number of hours = 102 hours/day Now, let's convert this value from hours to pages:  Pages read per day = Number of hours / 24 hours in a day  Pages read per day = 102 hours / 24 hours = 4.3 pages/day Therefore, Frank read approximately 4.3 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book and it had 555 pages equally distributed among 5 chapters. To find out how many pages are in each chapter, we can use the information that Frank spent 220 days reading the book. So, let's convert the number of days to pages per day: 220 days / 1 page per day = x pages per chapter (where x is the number of pages in each chapter) Now, since there are 5 chapters, we can multiply the number of pages per chapter by 5 to get the total number of pages in the book: x pages per chapter × 5 chapters = 5x pages Total number of pages in the book = 5x pages Therefore, based on the given information, there are 5x pages in the book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish writing his book and it has 193 pages with 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of days taken by him to complete the book (660) by the total number of chapters in the book (15). So, Frank read approximately 44 chapters per day (660 / 15 = 44).
Response:  If it took Frank 3 days to read through all of these books (since each book had 249 pages), then he must have read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the total number of pages by the time taken to read them:  Total pages = Number of books x Number of pages per book = 5 x 249 = 1245 pages  Time taken to read = Number of books / Reading speed in hours/day = 5 / x = 3 days  Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read per hour:  Pages read per hour = Total pages / Time taken to read = 1245 / 3 = 415 pages/hour  So, Frank read 415 pages per hour.
Response:  If it takes Frank 12 days to read each book and he has read through 6 books, then it will take him 72 days (12 x 6 = 72) to read all 66 pages of the remaining books. So, if it takes him 492 days to read all the books, that means he has read 66 / 0.72 = 90 books in total.
Response:  We know that it took Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day Now, we are given that the book had 112 pages. Therefore, we can plug in this value into our equation: Number of days = 112 / x Where x is the number of pages read per day By solving for x, we get: x = 112 / 16 = 7 pages per day So, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day.
"Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book for x days and he read 8 pages per day. So, we can write an equation as follows:

x = (Number of pages read/Pages read per day) × (Days taken to complete the book/Days read)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

x = (8/1) × (576/8) = 72

Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book for 30 days and the book had 450 pages (or ""siders"" as you say in Danish). So, to find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the number of days by the number of pages: 30 days / 450 pages = approximately 15 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish reading his favorite book. If we divide this number by the number of chapters in the book (which is 3), we get the average time it took him to read each chapter: 607 / 3 = 202 days per chapter. Since each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages in each chapter as follows: 594 pages/chapter x 202 days/chapter = 118,800 pages per chapter. Therefore, there are approximately 118,800 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read through his favorite book for 664 days and the book had two chapters with each having 405 pages. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can use the formula: Number of chapters read per day = Total number of days / Number of chapters in the book x Number of pages per chapter So, plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of chapters read per day = 664 days / (2 chapters x 405 pages/chapter) = 179 chapters/day Therefore, Frank read 179 chapters per day during the time he spent reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that 6 packs of DVD can be bought for $120. To find out how much each pack costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of packs. So, $120 / 6 = $20 per pack. Therefore, each pack of 6 DVDs costs $20.
Response:  If one package costs $81, then three packages will cost $81 x 3 = $243. So, it will cost $243 to buy 33 packets of DVDs.
Response:  We know that each package of DVD'ers costs $107. If there is a discount of $106 on each package, then we can calculate the cost per package as follows: Cost = Price - Discount = $107 - $106 = $1. So, if you want to buy X packages with $93, you will be able to buy X/1 = 93 packages.
Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then we need to calculate how much one package costs after applying the discount. So, the cost of one package = $76 - ( $76 x 25% ) = $76 - $19 = $57. Therefore, you will have to pay $57 for each package of DVDs.
"Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...

Answer Explanation: To find out how many DVDs can be bought with $104, we need to divide the amount of money available ($104) by the cost of one DVD ($26). This gives us the number of DVDs that can be purchased:

$104 / $26 = 4

So, if you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, you can buy 4 DVDs."
Response:  If we have two packages of DVDs and each package costs $28, then... (insert calculation) Therefore, each package of DVDs costs $14.
Response:  If there are 18 bananas in Phil's collection and they are grouped into sizes of two, then we need to find out how many groups of two bananas each exist. To do this, we can divide 18 by 2: 18 / 2 = 9 So, there are 9 groups of two bananas each.
"Response:  We know that there are some bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size $187$. So, we need to find out how many groups Philip has in his collection.  To do this, we can use the fact that the total number of bananas in all the groups is equal to the product of the number of groups and the average number of bananas per group.  Therefore, we can write:
$$\text{Total number of bananas} = \text{Number of groups} \times \text{Average number of bananas per group}$$
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:
$$\begin{align\*}
\text{Total number of bananas} &= 140 \times? \\
&= 140 \times \frac{\text{number of bananas in Philip's collection}}{\text{total number of bananas}} \\
\end{align\*})$$We are also given that the total number of bananas is equal to $325$, so we can solve for $\text{number of bananas in Philip's collection}$:
$$\begin{align\*}
\text{number of bananas in Philip's collection} &= \frac{\text{Total number of bananas}}{140} \\
&= \frac{325}{140} \\
&= 23 \\
\end{align\*})$$Therefore, Philip has $23$ groups of bananas in his collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 apples in Phil's collection. If we divide the bananas into 7 groups of equal size, then each group will contain 28 bananas (203 / 7 = 28). Similarly, if we divide the apples into 95 groups of equal size, then each group will contain 6 apples (63 / 95 = 6). Therefore, the sizes of the groups are as follows: Bananas - 28 per group; Apples - 6 per group."
"Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 apples in Phil's collection. If we divide the bananas into groups of 47 each, then the number of groups is:

$$ \text {Number of groups} = \divide{142}{47} = 3 $$

Similarly, if we divide the apples into groups of 178 each, then the number of groups is:

$$ \text {Number of groups} = \divide{356}{178} = 2 $$

Therefore, the size of the groups for both bananas and apples are $3$ and $2$, respectively."
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's collection of bananas and each group contains 392 bananas. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of bananas = Total number of groups x Number of bananas per group  In this case, we have:  Number of bananas = 196 x 392  Therefore, there are 75,048 bananas in Philip's collection (196 x 392).
Response:  We know that there are 18 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. If there are 180 bananas in total, then each group contains 18/180 = 10 bananas. Therefore, there are 18 groups or 18 x 10 = 180 bananas in Philip's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 87 apples and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into two groups of 145 each, then we have: Group 1 has 145 bananas = 145/2 = 72.5 bananas per group Group 2 has 145 bananas = 145/2 = 72.5 bananas per group Now, if we divide the apples into 93 groups, each group will contain: Apples in Group 1 = 87 / 93 = 0.93 apples per group Apples in Group 2 = 87 / 93 = 0.93 apples per group Therefore, the size of the apple and banana groups is approximately equal to 0.93 apples or 0.93 x 2 = 1.86 bananas per person.
"Response:  We know that there are 384 apple trees and 192 banana plants in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into groups of 345 each, then we will have 345 groups of bananas. Similarly, if we divide the apples into groups of 16 each, then we will have 16 groups of apples. So, the size of each group is:  Bananas: 345; Apples: 16."
Response:  If Brenda has made 38 cakes and each of them contains 19 pieces, then she has made in total 38 x 19 = 702 pieces of cake. So, she has baked 702 cakes for her guests.
Response:  If Brenda had 14 bags of chips and each bag contained 30 chips, then she would have... (14 x 30 =)...140 chips in total!
Response:  If Brenda made 22 kagers and threw away 17 of them, that means she had 5 kagers left. So, if they all had the same number of small kagers, then there were 5 small kagers in total.
Response:  If Brenda made 18 kagers and each guest received an equal number of kags, then she must have given out 18/2 = 9 kagers to each of the 10 guests who came. So, in total, Brenda gave out 9 x 10 = 90 kagers.
"Response:  If Brenda had 14 large bags of chips and she shared them equally among two guests, then each guest would get an equal number of chips. So, if there were x chips in each bag, then each guest would have x/2 chips. Since we know that Brenda had 14 bags, and each bag contained the same number of chips, we can set up the equation:

x = (14 x / 2)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 70

So, there were 70 chips in each bag."
Response:  If Brenda made 10 kagers in total and each guest received two kagsers, then the number of guests she served is given by the equation: Number of guests = Total number of kagers / Number of kagers per guest. In this case, we are given that Brenda made 10 kagers in total, so let's substitute this value into the equation: Number of guests = 10 / 2 = 5 guests. Therefore, Brenda served 5 guests with kagers.
Response:  If Frank had 42 pieces of candy and he puts them in two boxes, then there must be an odd number of candies in each box since Frank is odd. So, if x is the number of candies in one box, we can write: x + 1 = 42 (since Frank has 42 candies altogether). Now, we have two equations: x + 1 = 42 and x = 42 - 1. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 21 and x = 21. Therefore, there are 21 candies in one box and 21 + 21 = 42 candies in total.
"Response:  If Frank had some such as in the question and he put them in 26 positions with 33 pieces in each position, then we can calculate how many snacks Frank had as follows:

Number of positions = 26
Number of pieces per position = 33
Total number of pieces = Number of positions x Number of pieces per position
= 26 x 33
= 840

So, Frank had 840 snacks."
Response:  If Frank had 33 bricks and lost 24 of them, he would be left with 9 bricks. To find out how many piles of 9 bricks Frank would have, we can divide the number of remaining bricks (9) by the number of bricks in each pile (9): 9 / 9 = 1 pile. So, Frank would have one pile of 9 bricks.
"Response:  If Frank has 22 pieces of candy and he puts 11 in each position, then...

Answer: He would have 22 / 11 = 2 positions."
Response:  If Frank had 16 pieces of candy and he placed some in each of two positions, then we can assume that there were an equal number of candies in each position. So if there were x candies in one position, there would be x candies in the other position as well. Since Frank had 16 pieces of candy in total, the sum of the number of candies in both positions must be equal to 16. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x = 16. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. So there were 8 candies in each position.
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 cases of trefoil, and each case has 14 packets, then she needs to deliver 350 packets (25 x 14 = 350).
Response:  If Shirley has 10 boxes of Trefoil, and she wants to deliver 5 boxes, then there are 10 / 5 = 2 boxes in each box.
"Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in total. So we can write this as an equation:

Regular soda = 67
Diet soda = 9

Now let's subtract the number of diet soda from the number of regular soda to find out how many more regular soda there are:

Number of regular soda - Number of diet soda = 67 - 9 = 58

So there are 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that there were 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Regular soda = 22 bottles
Diet soda = 61 - 22 = 39 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles of diet soda there are than regular soda. To do this, we can subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the number of diet soda bottles:

Number of more diet soda bottles = 39 - 22 = 17 bottles

Therefore, there are 17 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda in the store."
"Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of bottles of cola and juice. So we can write an equation as follows:

Total Number of Bottles = Number of Cola Bottles + Number of Juice Bottles

From the problem statement, we know that there are 30 bottles of cola and 8 bottles of diet cola, so the number of cola bottles is 30. Similarly, we know that there are 41 bottles of applesauce, so the number of juice bottles is 41. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation:

Total Number of Bottles = 30 + 41

Now we have two numbers (30 and 41) that add up to a total value of 71. Is this correct?"
"Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of regular soda water and 53 bottles of diet soda water in total. So we can write this as an equation: 79 + 53 = x, where ""x"" represents the number of bottles of regular soda water. Now we are asked how many more bottles of regular soda water there were than diet soda water. To find out, we subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the total number of bottles: x - 53 = y, where ""y"" represents the number of more bottles of regular soda water. Finally, we can solve for ""y"" by adding 53 to both sides of the equation: y = x - 53. Therefore, there were 18 more bottles of regular soda water than diet soda water (i.e., y = 18)."
Response:  The total number of bottles is 54 + 83 = 137 bottles. Since there are more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we can say that the difference between these two quantities is equal to the total number of bottles of regular soda minus the number of bottles of diet soda. Therefore, the difference in bottles is: 137 - 83 = 54 bottles. So, there are 54 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that out of 17 bottles, 9 are regular soda and the remaining are diet soda. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 9/17 = 56%. Therefore, they have 56% of their total bottles as diet soda, which means they have 9/17 x 56% = 5 bottles of diet soda.  Now let's move to the apples. They have 29 apples in total.
Response:  The kiosk owner had 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. So in total, he has 89 bottles (19 + 60). Now we need to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda. To do this, we divide the number of regular soda bottles by the number of diet soda bottles:  Number of regular soda bottles = 60 / 19 = 3.2 With this calculation, we can conclude that there are 3 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  The total number of bottles is given as 72 + 32 = 104 bottles.  Since there are more than apples, we can say that the difference between the total number of bottles and the number of apple bottles is equal to the number of bottles with ordinary soda. Therefore, the number of bottles with ordinary soda is 104 - 32 = 72 bottles. So, they had more bottles of ordinary soda than apples.
Response:  The total number of bottles is given as follows: 36 apples + 80 ordinary soda water + 54 diet soda water = 160 bottles. Therefore, they have more than 36 apples.
Response:  We know that out of 30 bottles, 28 are regular soda and the remaining 2 are diet soda. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 2/30 = 1/15. Therefore, there are 15 bottles of diet soda.
"Response:  We know that in total they had 4 flasks of diet soda and 79 more flasks of regular soda. So, if we let x be the number of flasks of regular soda, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of flasks of diet soda = 4
Total number of flasks = Number of flasks of diet soda + Number of flasks of regular soda
= 4 + x

Now, we are also given that there were 79 more flasks of regular soda than diet soda. This means that for every flask of diet soda, there are 79/4 = 19.25 flasks of regular soda. So, we can rewrite the previous equation as follows:

Number of flasks of diet soda = 4
Total number of flasks = Number of flasks of diet soda + (Number of flasks of regular soda / 4)
= 4 + (x / 4) * 19.25

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Total number of flasks = 4 + x * 19.25

So, the answer to the question is x = 138."
"Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of bottles of each type. So we can write an equation as follows:

Total Number of Bottles = Number of Flasks of Ordinary Soda + Number of Flasks of Diet Soda + Number of Flasks of Light Soda

From the problem statement, we know that there are 57 flasks of ordinary soda, 26 flasks of diet soda, and 27 flasks of light soda. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation as follows:

Total Number of Bottles = 57 + 26 + 27

Simplifying this expression gives us:

Total Number of Bottles = 100

Therefore, the answer is 100 flasks in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of cola in total.  The number of bottles of regular cola is 60, and the number of bottles of diet cola is also 60. So, we have:

Total number of bottles = Number of regular cola + Number of diet cola
= 81 - (60 + 60)
= 81 - 120
= -39

Therefore, there are 39 more bottles of regular cola than diet cola."
Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of ordinary soda water in total. Of these, 40 bottles were diet soda water and 6 bottles were lightly sweetened soda water. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of ordinary soda waters = Total number of bottles - Number of diet soda waters - Number of lightly sweetened soda waters  Number of ordinary soda waters = 49 - (40 + 6)  Number of ordinary soda waters = 49 - 46  Number of ordinary soda waters = 3 Therefore, there were 3 bottles of ordinary soda water in the store.
Response:  If there were 317 guests at Buckingham Palace one day after 295 guests, then the difference in number of guests is 22 (317 - 295 = 22). So, the number of additional guests that visited Buckingham Palace that day was 22.
"Response:  If there were 703 guests at Buckingham Palace the day before and 246 visitors that day, then the number of visitors over the past 25 days would be:

703 + (246 x 24) = 703 + 58,960 = 59,660

So, there were approximately 59,660 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 25 days."
Response:  If there were 100 more guests than the previous day and they visited Buckingham Palace after having a good meal, then we can assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace increased by 100 from the previous day. So, if there were 666 visitors on the day in question, then the total number of visitors would be:  666 + (100 - 666) = 400 visitors.
"Response:  If 132 guests visited Buckingham Palace today and there have been 327 days since the last time they counted the number of visitors, then we can calculate the total number of visitors as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors today x Total number of days
= 132 x 327
= 42,560

Therefore, the answer is 42,560."
"Response:  If there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 829 people have visited in total over the last 85 days, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:

Average number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 9.76
So, approximately 9-10 people visit Buckingham Palace every day."
"Response:  If there were 557 guests at Buckingham Palace on the day after they had dinner, and 188 guests visited the palace the day before, then we can calculate how many guests visited the palace in total over 57 days as follows:

Day 1 to Day 57: Total number of guests = (Number of guests on Day 1 x Number of days) + (Number of guests on Day 2 x Number of days) +... + (Number of guests on Day 57 x Number of days)
Total number of guests = (188 x 57) + (557 x 1)
Total number of guests = 10,436 + 557
Total number of guests = 11,003
Therefore, there were 11,003 guests who visited Buckingham Palace over 57 days."
Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 661 guests visited the palace on the day after lunch. To find out how many more guests visited the palace on that day than the previous day, we need to subtract the number of guests who visited the palace the day before from the total number of guests who visited the palace on the day after lunch. So, if there were 600 guests who visited the palace the day before, then the difference between the number of guests who visited the palace on both days is:  661 - 600 = 61 guests. Therefore, 61 more guests visited Buckingham Palace on the day after lunch compared to the day before.
Response:  If there were 419 visitors the day before and 103 visitors the day before that, then there were 419 + 103 = 522 visitors in total the two days before the day of the meal.  And if there were 92 guests at Buckingham Palace on the day of the meal, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over those three days is 522 + 92 = 614 visitors.
Response:  If there were 512 guests at Buckingham Palace yesterday and 471 guests the day before that, then there were 35 (512 - 471) more guests yesterday than the day before. Similarly, if there were 808 guests today, then there are 436 (808 - 471) more guests today than yesterday. So, over the last 89 days, there have been a total of 35 + 436 = 471 additional guests at Buckingham Palace.
"Response:  If there were 705 guests at Buckingham Palace that day and 191 guests the day before, then the increase in number of guests from the previous day is:

$$ \text {Increase} = \text {705 - 191} = 514 $$

Similarly, if there were 457 guests the day after, then the difference between the current day and the previous two days is:

$$ \text {Difference} = \text {514 - (191 + 457)} = 326 $$

Therefore, the answer to the question is $326$."
Response:  If he needs to glue together 3 feathers and each feather requires 628 grams of glue, then he will need more glue for the additional feather. So, if he needs 159 grams more glue, that means he will need (159 g) + (628 g) = 787 grams of glue in total.
Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of paint to color the feathers and we have already used 260 grams of glue to stick them together. So, if he has only used 260 grams of glue so far, then he must have had 288 grams - 260 grams = 128 grams of glue left before he started coloring the feathers.
"Response:  We know that he needs to glue together and paint 10 feathers. He has already used 22 grams of glue more than needed. So, we can subtract this amount from the total amount of glue required. Therefore, the remaining amount of glue needed is:

Total amount of glue required = 353 grams - (22 grams / 10) = 353 grams - 22/10 = 331 grams

So, he has 331 grams of glue left after using 22 grams more than necessary."
"Response:  If he needs 166 grams of glue to stick together all his fingers and he currently has 20 grams of glue, then he will need more glue. To find out how much more glue he needs, we can divide the total amount of glue needed (166 grams) by the amount of glue he currently has (20 grams):

166 grams / 20 grams = 8.3 times more glue
So, if he currently has 20 grams of glue, he will need 8.3 x 20 = 166 grams of glue in total."
"Response:  If he has 557 grams of glue and needs to remove 17 grams in total, we can calculate how many grams of glue are left by subtracting the amount needed from the total amount available:

Grams of glue remaining = Total grams of glue - Amount needed
= 557 g - 17 g
= 540 g
Therefore, there are 540 grams of glue remaining after removing 17 grams."
"Response:  If he has 11 grams of glue and needs 492 grams in total to stick the feathers together, then we can calculate how much more glue he needs as follows:

Total amount of glue needed = 492 grams
Amount of glue he already has = 11 grams
Difference between total amount and amount he already has = Total amount - Amount he already has = 481 grams
Therefore, he needs an additional 481 grams of glue."
"Response:  If there are 94 pickings and each picking contains 90 tons of grapes in 6 days, then we can calculate the number of tons of grapes that need to be filled per day as follows:

Number of tons of grapes per day = Total number of tons of grapes / Number of days
= 90 tons/day x 6 days
= 540 tons/day

Therefore, there would need to be 540 tons of grapes filled every day for 6 days."
"Response:  If there are 266 pickings and each picking contains 90 tons of grapes in 5 days, then we can calculate the number of tons of grapes that need to be filled per day as follows:

Number of pickings = 266
Number of tons of grapes per picking = 90
Total number of tons of grapes = Number of pickings x Number of tons of grapes per picking = 266 x 90 = 23,440 tons

Now, let's divide the total number of tons of grapes by the number of days it takes to fill them (5 days):

Tons of grapes per day = Total number of tons of grapes / Number of days = 23,440 / 5 = 4,688 tons per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 244 tonnes of grapes per day and 47 tonnes of berries per day. To find out how many tonnes of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we need to divide the total number of grapes by the number of days. So, the answer is:

Tonnes of grapes = Total number of grapes / Number of days
= 244 tonnes/day x (146 days)
= 35,080 tonnes
Therefore, approximately 35,080 tonnes of grapes would be filled during the 146-day period."
"Response:  If there are 221 tønder druer per day and we want to know how many will be filled in 77 days, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of tønder druer = Total number of tønder druer / Number of days
= 221 tønder / 77 days
= 2964 tønder druer
Therefore, there will be approximately 2964 tønder druer filled during the 77-day period."
"Response:  If we have 252 pickers and they can fill 108 tons of grapes per day, then in total we have:

$$ \text {Total number of tons of grapes} = \text{Number of pickers} \times \text{Tons of grapes per day} $$

So, the total number of tons of grapes after 58 days would be:

$$ \text {Total number of tons of grapes after 58 days} = \text{Initial number of pickers} \times \left( \text{Tons of grapes per day} \times \text{Number of days} \right) $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text {Total number of tons of grapes after 58 days} = 252 \times (108 \times 58)} $$

Therefore, there would be approximately $26,432$ tons of grapes filled after 58 days."
"Response:  If it takes 36 pickers to fill 8 tons of grapes per day, and there are 240 tons in total, then we can calculate how many days it would take as follows:

Number of pickers x Number of tons per picker = Total number of tons collected per day
= 36 pickers x 8 tons/picker = 288 tons/day

Therefore, it would take approximately 288 days (or about 9 months) to collect 240 tons of grapes."
"Response:  If Han had 26 aquariums for saltwater fish and each aquarium has the same number of fish, then we can say that... See full solution

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If Han had 26 aquariums for saltwater fish and each aquarium has the same number of fish, then we can say that the total number of saltwater fish in all 26 aquariums is equal to the product of the number of aquariums and the number of fish in each aquarium.

So, if each aquarium has 52 saltwater fish, then the total number of saltwater fish in all 26 aquariums is:

26 x 52 = 1320

Therefore, there are 1320 saltwater fish in all of Han's aquariums."
Response:  If he had 40 saltwater fish in total and each aquarium has two fish, then we can calculate the number of aquariums as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of fish / Number of fish per aquarium = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Han had 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Since each aquarium has 39 fish in it, we can calculate the total number of fish as follows: Saltwater fish = 56 x 39 = 2174 Freshwater fish = 10 x 39 = 390 Total number of fish = 2174 + 390 = 2564 Therefore, Tyler has 2564 fish in his aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 22 aquariums for saltwater fish and each aquarium has 46 fish in it. So, we can calculate the total number of saltwater fish as follows:  Number of saltwater fish = Total number of aquariums x Number of fish per aquarium = 22 x 46 = 952 fish. Therefore, Tyler has 952 saltwater fish in his collection.
"Response:  For the saltwater tanks, he has 15 tanks and each tank contains 19 fish, so...

$$ \text {Number of fish in saltwater tanks} = 15 \times 19 = 285 $$
For the freshwater tanks, he has 62 tanks and each tank contains 19 fish, so...

$$ \text{Number of fish in freshwater tanks} = 62 \times 19 = 1,238 $$
Therefore, the total number of fish is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of fish}} = 285 + 1,238 = 1,523 $$"
Response:  If white T-shirts can be bought in packages of 13 pieces, then if Mor buys 39 white T-shirts, she will have to buy them in how many packages? We know that 39 / 13 = 3 packages. So, Mor has to buy her white T-shirts in 3 packages.
"Response:  If Mor buys 66 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then we can find out how many packages she will buy as follows:

Total number of T-shirts = Number of T-shirts per package x Total number of packages
= 3 x (Number of packages)
= 3 x 66
= 198

So, Mor will buy 198 packages of white T-shirts."
Response:  If mom buys 28 packages of white T-shirts and each package contains 56 white T-shirts in total, then we can calculate the number of white T-shirts per package as follows: Number of white T-shirts per package = Total number of white T-shirts / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2. Therefore, each package contains 2 white T-shirts.
Response:  If Mor can buy white T-shirts in packs of 53 pieces, then she will get 53 x 57 = 3093 white T-shirts if she buys 57 packets. Similarly, if she buys 34 pairs of pants, she will get 34 x 53 = 1822 white T-shirts. Therefore, Mor will get a total of 3093 + 1822 = 4915 white T-shirts.
"Response:  If she buys 51 white T-shirts and each T-shirt comes in packs of three, then...

$$ \begin{align\*} 51 &= 3^x \\ x &= \log_3(51) \end{align\*} $$

So, she will have $x = \log_3(51) = 4$ packets of T-shirts. $$"
Response:  If Mor buys 70 white T-shirts in total and each package contains X shirts, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of packages = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per package  In this case, we know that Mor buys 14 packages, so we can substitute this value into the equation:  Number of packages = 70 / X  Now we need to solve for X, which represents the number of shirts in each package. We can do this by dividing 70 by 14:  X = 70 / 14  So there are 5 shirts in each package (70 / 14).
Response:  If we have 4 positions with equal number of bags and total 36 bags, then each position must contain 9 bags (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  If you have 33 small bags and each bag has 11 small bags inside, then we can calculate the total number of small bags as follows: Total Number = 33 + (33 x 11) = 33 + 363 = 400 small bags. Therefore, you have 400 small bags in total.
Response:  If each pose has 41 small kebabs and you have 53 small kebabs in total, then you must have 2 poses with 41 small kebabs each. Therefore, you have 2 x 41 = 82 small kebabs in total.
Response:  If you have 14 small bags in total and each bag contains an equal number of small bags, then we can assume that each bag contains 1/14 of the total number of small bags. Therefore, if there are 7 positions with an equal number of small bags, then each position contains 1/7 of the total number of small bags. So, the answer is 14 x 7 = 98 small bags.
"Response:  If each pose has 3 small kebabs and you have 21 small kebabs in total, then we can calculate how many poses with small kebabs you have as follows:

Number of poses = Total number of small kebabs / Number of small kebabs per pose
= 21 / 3
= 7

So, you have 7 poses with small kebabs."
Response:  We know that you had 26 pieces of candy in total and we also know that there were 15 sour candies among them. So, if we subtract 15 from 26, we get 11. Now, we are told that there were 52 small candies in addition to the 15 sour ones. Therefore, the number of small candies is equal to 52 - 15 = 37. So, you have 37 poses with small candies.
Response:  We know that you had 14 pieces of cake and 86 sweets in total. If we divide the number of sweets (86) by the number of pieces of cake (14), we get 6 as an average number of sweets per piece of cake. So, if you have x pieces of cake, then you will have 6x sweets in total. Therefore, the answer is 6x.
Response:  If the spam bot sends 5 pieces of junk mail to each block and there are 10 blocks in total, then it will send 5 x 10 = 50 pieces of junk mail in total.  Therefore, there are 10 houses in one block.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the spam bot needs to send 9 pieces of junk mail to each house, then we need to calculate how many pieces of junk mail the spam bot will need to send overall. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the spam bot will need to send is:  Number of blocks x Number of houses per block x Number of pieces of junk mail per house = 20 x 9 x 9 = 1760 pieces of junk mail. Therefore, the spam bot will need to send 1760 pieces of junk mail to all the houses in the neighborhood.
Response:  If there are six houses in one block and each house receives 24 pieces of trash, then we need to divide 24 by 6 to find out how many pieces of trash each house will receive. So, the answer is 4 (i.e., 24 / 6 = 4). Therefore, the postman should give 4 pieces of trash to each house in that block.
Response:  If the postman gives 14 unwanted emails to each house in a block, and he wants to give two pieces of junk mail to each block, then there are 14 x 2 = 28 houses in one block. Therefore, there are 28 houses in each block.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the postman needs to deliver 32 pieces of junk mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that need to be delivered is:

20 x 32 = 640 pieces of junk mail."
Response:  We know that there are 78 blocks in total and each block has 19 houses. So, we need to calculate how many pieces of junk mail should be given to each house. Therefore, the number of pieces of junk mail for each house is 78/19 = 4.  Hence, he will give 4 pieces of junk mail to each of the 19 houses in each block.
Response:  If there are 55 blocks and each block has 8 pieces of junk mail, then the total number of pieces of junk mail is: 55 x 8 = 440.  Now, if he sends 32 mails to each house in a block, then the total number of houses in one block is: 55 / 32 = 17. So, there are 17 houses in each block.
Response:  If there are 4 pieces of junk mail to be delivered to each house in each of the 81 blocks, and there are 12 houses in each block, then we need to calculate how many pieces of junk mail should be delivered to each block. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the postman needs to deliver is:  Number of blocks x Number of houses per block x Number of pieces of junk mail per house = 81 x 12 x 4 = 3648 pieces of junk mail. Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 3648 pieces of junk mail to all the houses in the city.
Response:  If there are 16 blocks and each block has 4 houses, then the total number of houses is 16 x 4 = 64. So, if the postman wants to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, he will need to give a total of 64 x 4 = 256 pieces of junk mail.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 balls. If she wants to divide them into groups of four, we need to find out how many times 4 can go into 20.  So, let's divide 20 by 4: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, Rebecca will be able to create 5 groups of four balls each.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 kugler and 15 eggs to divide into groups of five. To find out how many groups will be created, we need to divide 15 by 5. So, the number of groups that will be created is:

15 / 5 = 3

Therefore, three groups of five eggs each will be created."
Response:  If Rebecca has to divide an egg collection into groups of 11, then she will have to distribute 11 eggs among 11 groups. Since each group consists of two eggs, Rebecca will have to give 2 eggs to each group. Therefore, Rebecca will have 2 x 11 = 22 eggs in total.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 balls. If she wants to divide them into four groups, each group must contain how many eggs?  To find out, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we want to divide 8 eggs by 4 groups. So, if we divide 8 by 4, we get 2 eggs per group. Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 kugler and 15 eggs. To divide them into three groups, we need to find out how many eggs each group should get.  Group 1: 4 kugler x 3 = 12 eggs  Group 2: 4 kugler x 2 = 8 eggs  Group 3: 4 kugler x 1 = 4 eggs Therefore, each group will have the following number of eggs: Group 1 - 12 eggs Group 2 - 8 eggs Group 3 - 4 eggs
Response:  We have to divide the total number of eggs (18) into groups of six. So we need to find out how many groups we can make with 18 eggs.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 18 by 6 to see how many groups we can make.  The result of this division is 3. That means we can make 3 groups of six eggs each.  Now let's look at the other ingredients. We have 72 bananas and 66 kuglers. These ingredients don't affect the number of groups we can make with the eggs, so we can ignore them for now.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 3 groups.
Response:  We have to divide the total number of objects into groups of three. So we will divide them like this: Bananas - 99 / 3 = 33 groups Kegs - 27 / 3 = 9 groups Eggs - 9 / 3 = 3 groups Therefore, there will be 33 + 9 + 3 = 45 groups in total.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. To divide them into groups of five, we need to distribute them equally among the groups. So, if we divide 20 eggs equally among 5 groups, each group will get 4 eggs. Similarly, if we divide 6 marbles equally among 5 groups, each group will get 1 marble. Therefore, Rebecca has 4 more eggs than marbles.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 kugler and 12 eggs. If she divides them into groups of 20, then each group will contain 20/5 = 4 eggs from each kugle. Therefore, Rebecca has 4 x 5 = 20 more eggs than marble. So, the answer is 20.
"Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in total and he got 11 points per round, then we can calculate his number of rounds as follows:

Total score = Number of rounds x Points per round
= 154 points x 11 points/round
= 1760 points (rounded to nearest integer)

So, Luke played 1760 rounds."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a trivia game and scored 46 points in each round, then he scored a total of:

$$ Total = \sum_{i=1}^{177} 46 = 8232 $$
So, Luke scored 8232 points in the entire game."
"Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after playing two rounds of a trivia game and each round awarded him the same number of points, then we can find out how many points he scored per round as follows:

Points scored by Luke = Total points scored / Number of rounds played
= 84 / 2
= 42 points per round
Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per round in the trivia game."
"Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of a game and played 157 rounds, then he would have scored a total of:

146 x 157 = 21,892 points

Therefore, Luke scored 21,892 points in the trivia game."
"Response:  If Luke scored 78 points in total and got 3 points per round, then he must have played x number of rounds. We can set up an equation to represent this situation as follows:

Total score = Number of rounds \* Points per round

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

78 = x \* 3

Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 3 gives us:

x = 26

Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds in the trivia game!"
Response:  Since Emily had two beads and could make 32 necklaces, we can write an equation: 2 + 2 = 32.  Now let's divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for the number of beads in each necklace: 2 + 2 = 16 (divided by 2) = 8. So there are 8 beads in each necklace.
Response:  If Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace takes 28 beads, then she used a total of 28 x 11 = 308 beads. So, Emily had 308 beads in total.
Response:  If Emily has 16 perlers and each necklace takes 8 perlers, then she can make 16 / 8 = 2 necklaces. Therefore, Emily can make 2 necklaces.
Response:  If Emily made 18 necklaces and had 6 beads, she must have used 3 beads for each necklace (since there are 3 beads in every halskæde). So, to find out how many beads were needed for one necklace, we can divide 6 by 3: 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, Emily needed 2 beads for each necklace.
Response:  If Emily made four necklaces with each taking 5 perls, then she had to make a total of 4 x 5 = 20 perls for all four necklaces together. So, in total, Emily had 20 perls.
Response:  If Emily has six perls and each necklace takes three perls, then she can make 6 / 3 = 2 necklaces. Since there are 72 friends, Emily can make 2 x 72 = 144 necklaces in total.
Response:  Since Emily has five perls and can make 20 necklaces, she needs to divide her total number of perls equally among all the necklaces. Therefore, each necklace requires 5/20 = 1/4 of a perle. So, there are 4 perles in each necklace.
Response:  If Emily made 44 friendship bracelets and each bracelet requires 2 pearls, then she used a total of 88 pearls (44 x 2 = 88). So, Emily had 88 pearls in total.
Response:  We know that 819058 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 668278 children stayed home. So we have a difference of 819058 - 668278 = 150780 children who spent their summer vacation at camp more than those who stayed home.
"Response:  We know that 202958 children went to camp from Lawrence County and 777622 children stayed home. To find out how many more children stayed home than went to camp, we can subtract these two numbers:

Number of children who stayed home = 777622 - 202958 = 574664

Therefore, there were 574664 more children who stayed home than went to camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in Lawrence county and we want to find out how many of them go to summer camp. The ratio is given as 629424/898051 = 0.72 or approximately 3/4. So, 3/4 of 898051 = 629424. Therefore, 629424 children will be at home during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 313.473 children in total and during summer vacation, 274.865 go home while the remaining 38.608 go to camp. So, the number of children who go to camp is equal to 38.608 / 313.473 = 0.127 or approximately 12.7% of the total number of children.
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who will be at home during summer vacation and 455682 children who will go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children there are in total in Lawrence County. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who will be at home by the number of children who will go to camp:  Total number of children = Number of children at home x Number of children going to camp  Total number of children = 907611 x 455682  Total number of children = 4,137,372,802 Therefore, there are approximately 4,137 billion children in Lawrence County.
Response:  If 800059 children go to summer camp and the remaining are at home in Lawrence county, then we can calculate the number of children who were left behind as follows: Number of children left behind = Total number of children in Lawrence County - Number of children going to summer camp Total number of children in Lawrence County = 828521 So, the number of children left behind is: Number of children left behind = 828521 - 800059 = 484662
Response:  We know that out of 61619 children at home, 3045 took part in summer camp (as stated). So, we have to find out how many children were left behind.  To do this, we can use the information given earlier - there are 91676 children in total in Lawrence County. Therefore, if 3045 went to summer camp, then the number of children remaining behind is:  Number of children remaining = Total number of children - Number of children who went to summer camp = 91676 - 3045 = 88631  So, out of the total number of children in Lawrence County, 88631 remained behind while 3045 went to summer camp.
Response:  We know that there are 34044 children from Lawrence County attending camp and 134867 children who will be at home. Additionally, we know that 424944 children from other countries participated in the camp. So, to find out how many children were at the camp overall, we can add up these numbers:  Total number of children = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children who will be at home + Number of children from other countries  Total number of children = 34044 + 134867 + 424944  Total number of children = 599885 Therefore, there were 599885 children at the camp overall.
Response:  We know that 610769 children from Lawrence County go to summer camp and 590796 children stay home. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children in Lawrence County = Total number of children - Number of children who go to summer camp. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of children in Lawrence County = 610769 - 590796 = 200973. Therefore, there are 200973 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children at home and 893835 children went to camp. This means that the number of children who did not go to camp is equal to the number of children who went to camp minus the number of children at home. So we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children at home = Number of children who didn't go to camp  Equation:  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of children at home = 893835 - 644997  Equation:  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of children at home = 250000  Therefore, there are 250000 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  If Adam has three more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total, then Jackie must have 6 apples (3 + 6 = 9). Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So, the answer is:  Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:  10 - 9 = 1 Therefore, Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam.
"Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, we can write:

Number of apples Jackie has - Number of apples Adam has = How many more apples Jackie has

We are given that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

10 - 8 = 2

Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam."
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together. If they have 4 more apples than they have together, then we can say that Adam has x apples and Jackie has x apples. Since they have 6 apples together, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 6... (1)

Now, we are told that Adam and Jackie have 4 more apples than they have together. So, we can subtract the number of apples they have together from their total number of apples to find out how many apples each person has:

x + x - 6 = 0... (2)

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 6

x = 3

So, Adam has 3 apples and Jackie has 3 apples as well."
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 7 apples.  If Adam has x apples more than Jackie, then he must have 7 + x = 16 apples in total (since he has more than Jackie). So, x = 9. Therefore, Adam has 9 apples more than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. If they have more than 12 apples combined, then Jackie must have fewer than 12 apples. So, if Jackie has x apples, Adam has 12 - x apples. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, we can write: Adam = 12 - x + 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. Therefore, Adam has 12 - 4 + 8 = 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has four more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 10 apples, then Adam has 14 apples (4 + 10). Now we are told that Adam and Jackie have two apples together. Therefore, the total number of apples they have is 16 (2 + 14). Finally, we are asked whether six apples more than Adam and Jackie together. This means that Adam has 10 apples (not including the two they share).
Response:  We know that Adam has more than five apples and less than or equal to ten apples. So, we can say that Adam has between six and ten apples. Since Jackie has eighty-nine apples, she must have fewer than one hundred apples. Therefore, Adam has at least nine apples but not more than ten apples.
Response:  We know that Helen baked 31 cakes yesterday morning (morgens), and then she baked another 270 cakes in the afternoon (forgårs). So far, we have 31 + 270 = 291 cakes. Now, let's check how many cakes Helen baked last night (aften): According to the question, Helen baked 419 cakes before Thanksgiving. Since Thanksgiving is tomorrow, we can assume that Helen didn't bake any more cakes after she finished preparing them for the holiday. Therefore, the total number of cakes Helen baked last night (aften) is 419. So, the answer to the question is: 391 cakes.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday), Helen baked 90 chocolate cakes. Today, she baked 51 rose-shaped cakes and 484 chocolate cakes. So in total, Helen has baked 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 chocolate cakes.
Response:  If Helen baked 527 chocolate cakes and 86 rose cakes yesterday, then she has baked a total of 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cakes so far.  If she also baked 86 rose cakes today, then the total number of chocolate cakes she has baked is now 613 - 86 = 527. So, Helen has baked 527 chocolate cakes in total.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 85 rosinkager so far today and she wants to have 397 rosinkager in total for Thanksgiving. So we can calculate how many more rosinkager she needs to bake:  Number of remaining rosinkager = Total number of rosinkager needed - Number of rosinkager baked so far = 397 - 85 = 312 Therefore, Helen has baked 312 rosinkager so far today.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday), Helen baked 19 chocolate cakes. Today (today), she baked 237 more chocolate cakes. So, in total, Helen has baked 256 chocolate cakes (19 + 237). Now, let's compare this number with the number of rose-shaped cookies that Helen baked. According to the question, Helen baked 231 rose-shaped cookies yesterday and 237 today, so in total, she has baked 468 rose-shaped cookies (231 + 237). Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate cakes and rose-shaped cookies that Helen baked is 256 - 468 = -212.
Response:  Yesterday (in går), Helen baked 197 chocolate cakes and 46 rose cakes. Today (i dag), she baked 75 rose cakes and 66 chocolate cakes. To find out how many more chocolate cakes Helen baked yesterday than today, we can subtract the number of chocolate cakes she baked today from the number she baked yesterday: 197 - 66 = 131. So, Helen baked 131 more chocolate cakes yesterday than today.
Response:  In the morning of thanksgiving day, Helen baked 280 rosinkager and in the afternoon she baked additional 359 chocolate kegger. So total number of rosinkager baked by Helen is 280 + 359 = 649. Therefore, the difference between the number of rosinkager baked by Helen in gourd and in da is 649 - 300 = 349.
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. So, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So, in total, Katie has 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now, let's find out how many games her old friends have. We are told that they have 53 games. Therefore, the total number of games among all three groups is 179 (Katie's new friends) + 53 (Katie's old friends) = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and 86 old games, so together she has 78 + 86 = 164 games. Her friends have 48 new games, so they have 48 alone. Therefore, the total number of new games that Katie and her friends have is 164 + 48 = 212 new games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has in total 103 games (84 + 19 = 103). Now, her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have in total 77 games (8 + 69 = 77). Therefore, the total number of new games that Katie and her friends have together is 103 + 77 = 180.
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So, in total, they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie played 57 board games and her friend played 63 DS games. To find out how many more games Katie played than her friend, we need to subtract the number of games her friend played from the number of games Katie played. So, the answer is: 57 - 63 = -6. Therefore, Katie played 6 fewer games than her friend.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Her friends have 34 new games, which means they have a total of 34 games as well. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends. The difference between Katie's number of games and her friend's number of games is 96 - 34 = 62. So, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $19 initially and then he earned $33 after washing cars. So, his new total amount of money is $19 + $33 = $52. Therefore, Jason earned $52 by washing cars.
"Response: 
Fred had $86 and worked for $9, so now he has $95 ($86 + $9). 
Jason had $5 and didn't work, so he still has $5.  Therefore, they have a total of $95 + $5 = $100 together."
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 at first and then he earned $20 in one day (Saturday). So, his new balance is: $19 + $20 = $39. Now we know that Jason started with $16 and earned $75 in total during the weekend ($69 from Saturday plus $7 from Sunday), so his new balance is: $16 + $75 = $91. Therefore, Fred earned $39 in total during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 and he spent some of it during the weekend. So, his remaining amount is $21 = $114 - x, where x is the amount he spent. Similarly, we know that Jason had $22 and he earned some money during the weekend. So, his remaining amount is $78 = $22 + y, where y is the amount he earned. Now, we can equate these two expressions to find out how much Jason earned in total during the weekend: $$ 21 = $114 - x \\ 78 = $22 + y $$ Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get: $$ x = $93 $$ Therefore, Jason earned $93 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 and then he earned $4 from washing cars. So now he has $115. Similarly, Jason had $40 and then he earned $6 from delivering newspapers. So now he has $44. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from washing cars is $115 - $4 = $111.
"Response: 
Fred had $49 and earned $73 from washing cars over the weekend, so he now has $112. 
Jason had $3 and earned $50 from delivering newspapers, so he now has $63.  Therefore, Jason earned $50 from delivering newspapers."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 and then he delivered newspapers to earn $14, so now he has $45.  Next, we know that Fred had $78 and then he washed cars over the weekend to earn $90, so now he has $168.  Therefore, the amount of money they earned from delivering newspapers is $45 - $31 = $14.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 at the beginning of the weekend. Then he earned $16 from delivering newspapers and $74 from washing cars. So, in total, Fred earned $90 during the weekend. Therefore, the answer is $90.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 initially. Then he earned $111 from delivering newspapers and spent $34 on washing cars. So his new balance is: $47 + $111 - $34 = $80. Therefore, Fred now has $80.
"Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg when she started running every day and lost 20 kg, then her current weight is:

71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg

So, Jessie now weighs 51 kg."
Response:  Before she started running, Jessie weighed 27 kg. After she started running every day, she lost 101 kg in total. So, if she lost 101 kg, then her weight before starting to run was:  Weight before running = Total weight lost - Current weight = 101 kg - 27 kg = 74 kg. Therefore, before she started running, Jessie weighed 74 kg.
Response:  Before she started running, Jessie weighed 192 kg (126 + 66).
"Response:  Before she started running, Jessie weighed 69 kg. If she lost 35 kg while running, then her current weight is:

69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg

So, Jessie now weighs 34 kg."
Response:  In week one, she lost 50 kg or 114 kg / 2 = 57 kg.  In week two, she lost another 60 kg or 57 kg x 2 = 134 kg. So now she weighs 134 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie weighed 9 kg initially. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, so her new weight is: 9 kg - 62 kg = 53 kg.  In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, so her new weight is: 53 kg - 140 kg = 87 kg. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 87 kg.
Response:  After Jessie started running every day, she lost 56 kg in the first week and 99 kg in the second week. So, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed...  We can start by using the information given in the question to find out how much Jessie weighed before she started running. According to the question, Jessie weighed 92 kg before she started running. Now, let's use this information to calculate how much Jessie weighed after the first week of running. If Jessie lost 56 kg in the first week, then her weight after the first week would be: 92 kg - 56 kg = 36 kg. Therefore, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed 36 kg.
"Response:  If we assume that each snake hid itself in a different location (i.e., not necessarily in the same hiding place as its neighbor), then...

Let S be the number of snakes that hid themselves. Since there were 95 snakes initially, and 64 of them hid themselves, we can write:
S = 95 - 64 = 31

So, 31 snakes did not hide themselves."
Response:  If you had 93 snakes and 97 alligators in a den (which is not possible), then if 40 of them hid themselves, there would be 57 alligators left that did not hide themselves.
Response:  We know that there were initially 75 alligators and 82 snakes in the den. If 75 alligators are hiding where are 82 snakes hiding? So, there are no alligators hiding.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 animals in total in the enclosure.  From this information, we can conclude that if 24 snakes and 51 alligators are hiding, then the number of animals not hiding is:

$$ \boxed{79 - (24 + 51)} = 79 - 75 = 4 $$

Therefore, 4 animals are not hiding."
Response:  Yesterday, Bonde had 171 tomatoes in his garden and took 134 of them. So he has 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left from yesterday. Today, he takes 30 more tomatoes, so he will have 37 - 30 = 7 tomatoes left after today. Therefore, Bonde will have 7 tomatoes left in his garden after today.
Response:  Yesterday (går), Bonde had 160 tomatoes in his garden and took 56 of them. So, he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left after yesterday's harvest. Today, he took 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 - 41 = 63 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday (yestarday), Bonde had 90 tomatoes in his garden. If he took 154 of them yesterday and 50 today, then the total number of tomatoes he collected is:  90 + 154 = 244 - 50 = 194 tomatoes. So, Bonde collected 194 tomatoes in total.
Response:  If Bonde had 175 tomatoes and he picked 172 potatoes, then he has 3 tomatoes left (175 - 172 = 3).
"Response:  If Bonde had 177 tomatoes and he picked 53 of them, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he had 12 kartoflers (potatoes) and he picked none of them, then he still has 12 kartoflers. So, to summarize: Number of tomatoes left = 124; number of potatoes left = 12."
Response:  We know that Bonde had initially 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 137 tomatoes, then we can say that he picked (137 - 105) = 32 green tomatoes and (137 - 71) = 66 red tomatoes. So, there are 32 green tomatoes and 66 red tomatoes left in the garden after Bonde picked 137 tomatoes.
Response:  If he used 4 nails for each of the large wooden boards, and each board needs two nails to be fixed, then... (1)...he will need 8 nails in total to fix all the boards. (2)...if there are x boards in total, then he will need 8x nails in total. So, the number of boards that John will use is 8x / 4 = 2x.
Response:  We know that for the walls of the house he used 13 large boards and each board requires 17 nails to be nailed down. So, we need to calculate how many nails are needed in total. The number of nails required is equal to the number of boards multiplied by the number of nails per board. Therefore, the total number of nails needed is: 13 x 17 = 201 nails.
"Response:  If he used 11 nails to fix each large wooden board, and there are additional 8 nails, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many boards John needs for one wall of the house.
Let's assume that one wall requires x number of boards. Since there are 11 nails per board, we can calculate the number of boards as follows:
x = (Number of nails / Number of nails per board)
x = (11 / 11) = 1
So, John needs 1 board for one wall.

Step 2: Calculate how many walls John needs to build for the entire house.
Since the house has multiple walls, let's assume that John needs to build y walls for the entire house. Therefore, the total number of boards John needs is:
Total number of boards = Number of walls \* Number of boards per wall
Total number of boards = y \* 1

Now, we know that John needs 1 board for every wall he builds, so:
y = Total number of boards / Number of boards per wall
y = 10 (since there are 10 walls in a typical house)
Therefore, John needs to build 10 walls for the entire house.

Conclusion: Based on the information provided, John needs to use 10 boards for the entire house."
Response:  Firstly, we know that big boards require 15 nails and small boards require 5 nails to fix them onto the wall. So, if John used 12 big boards and 10 small boards for the walls of his house, he will need 15 x 12 = 180 nails to fix the big boards and 5 x 10 = 50 nails to fix the small boards. Therefore, John will need in total 180 + 50 = 230 nails to fix all the boards onto the wall of his house.
"Response:  We know that John used 16 large boards for the walls of his house. Each board requires two nails (or ""søm"" in Danish), so he will need 8 nails in total. Therefore, John will use 8 nails or søm to secure the boards for the walls of his house."
Response:  If he used 8 big boards for the walls of the house and each board requires 74 nails to fix it, then we need to calculate how many boards John needs to use. We can do this by dividing the total number of nails required (74) by the number of nails needed per board (74). So, John will need 1 board.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that big boards require 14 pieces of nails and small boards require 25 pieces of nails per board.  Therefore, if John uses 12 large boards and 17 small boards, he will need a total of:

Large boards x Number of nails = 12 x 14 = 168 nails
Small boards x Number of nails = 17 x 25 = 425 nails
Total number of nails needed = Large boards + Small boards = 168 + 425 = 593 nails
Therefore, John needs to use 593 planks to build the walls of his house."
Response:  We know that there are 42 gummies in total and each package contains 3 pieces of gummy. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of packages = Total number of gummies / Number of gummies per package.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of packages = 42 / 3 = 14 packages. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gummies.
"Response:  We know that there are 43 packages of gummies and each package contains 23 pieces. So, we have:

43 x 23 = 1006

Now, we also know that Robin has 8 extra gummies. Therefore, the total number of gummies Robin has is:

1006 + 8 = 1014

So, Robin has 1014 gummies in total."
Response:  We know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package and Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. So, the total number of pieces of gum is: 7 x 5 = 35 pieces of gum. Since we were asked how many packages Robin has, we can divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces per package to find out how many packages Robin has: 35 / 7 = 5 packages. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces of gum. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces of gum as follows:  Number of pieces of gum = Total number of packages x Number of pieces in each package  Number of pieces of gum = 28 x 4  Number of pieces of gum = 112 pieces of gum Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces of gum. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pieces of gum = Total number of packages x Number of pieces per package  In this case, the total number of packages is 21, and the number of pieces per package is 9. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the total number of pieces of gum:  Number of pieces of gum = 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum.  So, Robin has 189 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 6 pieces of gum. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces of gum as follows:  Number of pieces = Total number of packages x Number of pieces in each package  Number of pieces = 28 x 6  Number of pieces = 168 Therefore, Robin has 168 pieces of gum.
Response:  If one shirt takes 1 minute to make and there were six shirts in total, then it will take 6 minutes for all of them to be made. So, the machine was working for 6 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine worked for 5 minutes and can produce 4 shirts per minute. So, in 5 minutes, it has produced 4 x 5 = 20 shirts. Therefore, the answer is 20 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine washed 9 shirts in total. If it can do three shirts per minute, then it worked for... (3 x 9 =) 27 minutes yesterday. Today, the machine washed 44 shirts in total. If it can do three shirts per minute, then it worked for... (44 / 3 =)... 14 minutes today. So, the machine worked for 27 + 14 = 41 minutes in total.
"Response:  Yesterday, the machine washed 13 shirts in total. If it can do 8 shirts per minute, then it worked for... See More
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Yesterday, the machine washed 13 shirts in total. If it can do 8 shirts per minute, then it worked for:

13 shirts / 8 shirts/minute = 16 minutes (yesterday)

Today, the machine washed 3 shirts. So, it worked for:

3 shirts / 8 shirts/minute = 4 minutes (today)

Therefore, the machine worked for a total of 16 + 4 = 20 minutes."
Response:  Yesterday, the machine washed 9 shirts in total (yesterday + today). So, if it can do two shirts per minute, then the time taken to wash those shirts is: Time = Number of shirts / Speed = 9 / 2 = 4.5 minutes Today, the machine washed 8 shirts, so again we need to calculate the time taken for that: Time = Number of shirts / Speed = 8 / 2 = 4 minutes Therefore, the machine worked for 4.5 minutes yesterday and 4 minutes today.
"Response:  If yesterday the machine could make three shirts in one minute and today it made eight shirts in one minute, then we can say that the difference between the number of shirts produced yesterday and today is equal to the number of minutes taken to produce those shirts. So, if yesterday the machine took x minutes to produce three shirts, then today it took (x + y) minutes to produce eight shirts, where y is the difference between the number of shirts produced yesterday and today. Therefore, we have:

3 = x + (y - 3)

Now, we are given that yesterday the machine produced four shirts in one minute, so the time taken to produce each shirt was:

x = 4 / 1 = 4

Similarly, today the machine produced eight shirts in one minute, so the time taken to produce each shirt was:

y = 8 / 1 = 8

Substituting these values in the equation above, we get:

3 = 4 + 8 - 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 7 minutes to produce three shirts yesterday and 8 minutes to produce eight shirts today."
Response:  If the machine can make six shirts in one minute and it took 12 minutes to make six shirts yesterday, then it made 6 x 12 = 72 shirts yesterday.  And if it takes 14 minutes to make six shirts today, then it made 6 x 14 = 84 shirts today. So, in total, the machine made 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  If the machine could make six shirts in one minute yesterday and made twelve shirts today, then we can calculate how many shirts it made today as follows: Number of shirts made today = Total number of shirts made yesterday x Rate at which the machine produced shirts today / Rate at which the machine produced shirts yesterday  In this case, the total number of shirts made yesterday was five minutes x 6 shirts/minute = 30 shirts Today, the rate at which the machine produced shirts is 12 shirts/minute So, to find out how many shirts the machine made today, we divide the total number of shirts made yesterday by the rate at which the machine produced shirts today: Number of shirts made today = 30 shirts x (12 shirts/minute) / (6 shirts/minute) = 48 shirts Therefore, the machine made 48 shirts today.
"Response:  We know that they earned $165 in total over 5 days, so we can write this as:

$165 = x \* 5

where x is the amount they earned per day.  Solving for x, we get:

x = $165 / 5

x = 33

So, they earned $33 per day."
Response:  If they earned $144 per day and were at the carnival for 22 days, then their total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Daily earnings x Number of days at the carnival Total earnings = $144 x 22 Total earnings = $3,088 So, they earned $3,088 during the carnival.
Response:  We know that Ringkastet earned $420 in total over 30 days, which means it earned an average of $14 per day.  Now, we are asked how much Ring Toss-spillet earned each day. Since Ring Toss also earned $22, we can conclude that it earned twice as much as Ringkastet, or $44 per day.
Response:  First 44 days = $382 x 44 = $16,596  Remaining 10 days = $374 x 10 = $3,740 Total amount earned = $16,596 + $3,740 = $20,336
Response:  The first 20 days of carnival earned $120 per day, and the remaining 16 days earned $66 per day. So, to find out how much they earned per day in the first 20 days, we can simply multiply the total amount earned during those days by 20: Total earnings = $120 x 20 = $2400. Therefore, they earned $2400 / 20 = $120 per day during the first 20 days of carnival.
"Response:  We know that in the first 154 days of carnival, they earned $325 and in the remaining 57 days, they earned $114. So, we can write this as follows:

$325 x (154/301) = Total earnings for first 154 days
$114 x (57/301) = Total earnings for last 57 days

Now, to find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total earnings by the number of days left:

Total earnings for last 57 days / Number of days left = Daily earnings

So, the daily earnings of the ringkastert on the carnival were:

($114 x 57)/301 = $68.94 per day

Therefore, the answer is $68.94."
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packets of candy and 4 packets of candy, then she has bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packets of candy.
Response:  Lucy bought x number of packages of candy and y number of packages of chocolate. We know that x + y = 4 (the total number of packages she bought). Also, we know that 2x + 3y = 22 (the total cost of the candy) and 5y = 16 (the total cost of the chocolate). Now we can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the system of equations, we get x = 8 and y = 4. So Lucy bought 8 packages of candy and 4 packages of chocolate in total.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packets of candy and some packets of cake. In total, she had 27 packets of food. So, we can say that she bought x packets of cake, where x is the difference between the number of packets of candy (23) and the total number of packets of food (27). Therefore, x = 4. So, Lucy bought 4 packets of cake.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought two packages of candy and 12 packages of candy in total. So she spent $2 x 12 = $24 for all the candy. Then we are told that after buying the candy, she had $56 left. Therefore, the cost of each package of candy is $56 / 12 = $4.50 per package. So Lucy bought $2 x 2 = $4 worth of candy.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, four more people got on the bus at the next stop. So, now we need to find out how many people are currently in the bus. We know that each bus can carry up to 36 passengers, so if there are already 12 people in the bus and then four more get on, there will be a total of 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus right now. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  At first, there were eight people in the bus. Then, twelve more got on board and three got off. So, now there are... (8 + 12 - 3) = 23 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were four people on the bus. Then, 13 more people got on the bus. So, in total, how many people are now on the bus?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of people initially = 4 + 13 = 17 People currently on the bus = 17 - 4 = 13 Therefore, there are 13 people currently on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 8 more people got on the train, so now there are 19 people on the train (11 + 8 = 19).
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and 676 people in total. To find out how many students were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 students present in the program.
Response:  There were 73 fathers, 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. To find out how many people were present at the program, we need to add up these numbers: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531. Therefore, there were 1531 people present at the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in the program. To find out how many more students than parents were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents in the program.
Response:  There were 61 parents and 177 students. If we assume that all of them attended the program (which is unlikely), then there would be 61 + 177 = 238 people in total. However, since the program could only accommodate 44 people at a time, it means that not everyone who wanted to attend was able to do so.
Response:  We know that the depth of the hole is 919 feet and they need to climb 1307 feet to reach the top. So, we can calculate the distance from the bottom of the hole to the top as follows: Distance = Depth + Desired height = 919 + 1307 = 2226 feet Therefore, it is 2226 feet from the bottom of the hole to the top.
Response:  We know that Hulen is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they move with 17 km/h, how far will they reach the end of the cave?  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance is the length of the cave (1218 - 849) feet, which is equal to 369 feet. So, if they move with 17 km/h, it will take them approximately 369 / 17 = 21.5 hours to reach the end of the cave.
"Response:  We know that the depth of the hole is 762 feet and the height of the people is 659 feet. To find out how far they are from reaching the bottom of the hole, we need to subtract their height from the depth of the hole. So, the distance between them and the bottom of the hole is:

Distance = Depth - Height = 762 - 659 = 133 feet

Therefore, they are 133 feet away from reaching the bottom of the hole."
Response:  We know that Paige had raised eight goldfish in the pond to begin with. The passage states that she loved eating goldfish and left six of them behind afterward. Therefore, we can deduce that six goldfish were consumed (i.e., eaten). So, the number of goldfish remaining in the pond is equal to the initial number minus the number consumed = 8 - 6 = 2.  Hence, two goldfish are missing or have disappeared from the pond.
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 mudfish in the pond initially. If we assume that none of them escaped or were eaten by other animals, then the total number of fish she had was 7 + 12 = 19. Now, we are told that some cats loved to eat them but didn't eat all of them. So, the remaining number of fish after the cats ate some is 19 - x, where x is the number of fish eaten by the cats. Since we don't have any information about how many fish the cats ate, we can't determine exactly how many fish disappeared. However, since Paige now has 15 fish left, it means that x must be greater than or equal to 15 (since 0 is not a valid value). Therefore, the answer is between 15 and 19, inclusive.
Response:  We know that Paige caught 16 goldfish and 71 pike in the pond. If they forgot to feed their cats, then we can assume that all of the fish were eaten. So, the number of goldfish that are left is zero. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Paige caught 15 goldfish in the pond and forgot to feed them. Out of those, 5 were eaten by the cat (as stated in the problem). So, the number of goldfish left is: 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  The chef had 43 apples initially and used some of them to make pies. After making pies, he had 2 apples left. So, the number of apples he used is equal to the number of apples he had left, which is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  We know that initially, there were 58 apples and after making some pies, he used 35 of them. So, the number of apples left is:

58 - 35 = 23

Therefore, there are 23 apples left."
Response:  We know that he had 40 apples and made some pies, so after making the pies, he had 39 apples left. So, we can say that he used x = 40 - 39 = 1 apple to make the pies. Therefore, he used 1 apple in total.
Response:  If Adam can fit 11 action figures on each shelf and his room has 4 shelves, then he can fit a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures in his room. However, since there are 40 spaces available for action figures, we subtract that number from the total to get the maximum number of action figures that Adam could have: 44 - 40 = 4. Therefore, Adam could have up to 4 action figures on each shelf, or a total of 4 x 4 = 16 action figures in his room.
Response:  If Adam can fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room and his room has space for 8 action figures, then we need to find out how many shelves he has in his room. So, the number of shelves = Number of action figures that can fit in the room / Number of action figures that can fit on each shelf.  In this case, the number of shelves = 8 (the maximum number of action figures that can fit in the room) / 10 (the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf). Therefore, the number of shelves in Adam's room is 8/10 = 0.8 or 80%.
Response:  If Adam can fit 8 action figures and 10 toys per shelf in his room, then he has 8 + 10 = 18 items that can be placed on each of the 4 shelves. Therefore, the total number of things that Adam's shelves can hold is 18 x 4 = 72.
Response:  There are 544 krukker in each of the 10 gardens. Each krukke has 32 flowers inside it. So, the total number of flowers is: 544 x 32 = 17,656 flowers.
Response:  We know that there are 466 graters and each grater has 53 flowers and 181 pinecones in it. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,078 Number of pinecones = 466 x 181 = 86,966 Therefore, there are 24,078 flowers and 86,966 pinecones in total.
Response:  We know that there are 141 buckets and each bucket has 71 flowers and 91 leaves. So, we can write this as an equation:  Number of buckets = 141 Flowers in each bucket = 71 Leaves in each bucket = 91 Total number of flowers =? To find the total number of flowers, we need to multiply the number of buckets by the number of flowers in each bucket. Therefore, the answer is: Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9631 flowers.
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pots = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pots = 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 pots in total.
"Response:  If we divide 4502 Skittles into groups of 154 each, then we will have:

4502 / 154 = 29

So there are 29 groups of Skittles in total.

Similarly, if we divide 4276 gummies into groups of 154 each, we get:

4276 / 154 = 28

Therefore, there are 28 groups of gummies in total."
Response:  If we have 3941 Skittles in Stevens collection and he also has 4950 Viskegummi, then we can create groups of Skittles as follows: Group size = Total number of Skittles / Number of gummies = 3941 / 4950 = 7 Groups So, each group will contain approximately 568 Skittles ( rounded to nearest whole number).
"Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Stevens collection and he also has 517 gummies. If we divide them into groups of 8, then the number of groups is:

Number of groups = Total number of items / Number of items per group
= 896 + 517 - (517 x 2)
= 896 + 517 - 1034
= -337

So, there are 337 groups of Skittles and gummies if they are divided into groups of 8."
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes at the school.
Response:  We know that the school has 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we need to find out how many students are in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of classes with the number of students in each class: 304 x 75 = 22,600. Therefore, there were 22,600 students in the school.
