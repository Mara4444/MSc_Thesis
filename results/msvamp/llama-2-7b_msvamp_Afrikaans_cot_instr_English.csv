Response:  Julia had 18 children to play with on Monday and 10 children to play with on Tuesday. So, she played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference between these two numbers is 8 (18 - 10). Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 11 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 12 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Tuesday and Monday is:

12 - 11 = 1

Therefore, Julia had one more child to play with on Tuesday than on Monday."
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday (het Maandag). On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with a few other children. If she played with 15 children in total, then she must have played with 10 children on Tuesday (Dinsdag) since 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday and then she played with 14 children on Tuesday. If she had played with 16 children, that means she played with more than 14 children. So, Julia played with 16 - 14 = 2 additional children on Monday. Therefore, Julia played with 2 + 5 = 7 children on Monday.
Response:  Julia played with 16 children on Monday and more than 12 children together on Monday. So, she played with at least 12 + 16 = 28 children on Monday.
Response:  Julia had 14 children to play with on Tuesday and more than 8 children on Monday. So, if she played with 8 additional children on Monday, then she must have played with a total of 22 children (14 + 8). Therefore, Julia played with 22 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday (Woensdag), she played with 2 children. Therefore, in total, Julia has played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 18 children. So, together they played with 33 children (15 + 18).
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 5 children and on Wednesday she played with 15 children. So, the total number of children Julia played with on these two days is: 5 + 15 = 20.
Response:  On Monday (Dinsdag), Julia had 2 children playing with her. On Tuesday (Woensdag), she had 14 children playing with her. Therefore, the number of children Julia played with together on both days is: 2 + 14 = 16.
"Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 9 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 7 children. And on Wednesday (Woensdag), she played with 96 children. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and the number of children she played with on Tuesday:

9 - 7 = 2

Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday."
"Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 2 children. And on Wednesday (Woensdag), she played with 8 children. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and the number of children she played with on Wednesday:

Monday - Wednesday = 14 - 8 = 6

Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than she did on Wednesday."
"Response:  On Monday (Dinsdag), Julia played with 11 children. On Tuesday (Woensdag), she played with 9 children. So, we can calculate the difference between these two numbers:

11 - 9 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 more children that Julia played with on Tuesday than on Monday."
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 children altogether. On Wednesday, she played with 7 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday compared to Wednesday is: 33 - 7 = 26 children.
Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 10 children. And on Wednesday (Woensdag), she played with 15 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (Maandag), Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 13 children. And on Wednesday (Woensdag), she played with 20 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children.
Response:  Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. So, she spent a total of 34 hours playing with them. To find out how many children she played with in total, we can divide the total time by the number of days she played: 34 hours / 2 days = 17 children. Therefore, Julia played with 17 children in total.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 19 children and spent 38 hours playing. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children and spent 38 hours playing again. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 19 - 18 = 1. So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Maandag), she played with 6 children. On Tuesday (Dinsdag), she played with 5 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 6 - 5 = 1 more child. Therefore, Julia played with 1 more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. On Monday, she played with 4 children. So, the number of children she played with on Monday is 4. Now, let's find out how many children she played with on Tuesday. According to the question, she played with ""a few"" children on Tuesday. Since ""a few"" is not a specific number, we can assume that Julia played with at least 2 children on Tuesday (since ""a few"" means more than one). Therefore, the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday is 4 + 2 = 6."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 6 children, and on Wednesday she played with 4 children. So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is: 6 - 4 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  If Bobby had eaten $25$ pieces of candy at first and then he ate another $43$ pieces, how many pieces of candy did he eat in total? So, the answer is $68$.
Response:  Bobby had already eaten 28 pieces of candy and then he ate another 42 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. However, we are also told that he has eaten 63 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to 5 pieces of candy, Bobby has actually eaten 63 / 5 = 12.6 pieces of candy more than he initially thought (i.e., 70 - 12.6 = 57.4 pieces). Therefore, Bobby has eaten a total of 70 + 57.4 = 127.4 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had already eaten 33 pieces of candy and then he ate 4 more. So, he has eaten a total of 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Additionally, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby has eaten a total of 37 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces. So in total, he has eaten 74 pieces of candy (38 + 36). Now we know that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the number of candies and chocolates is 74 - 16 = 58. So, Bobby has eaten more candy than chocolate.
Response:  Bobby had 20 pieces of candy at first (20). Then he ate 34 pieces (34), leaving him with 18 remaining (18). So, in total, Bobby has eaten 34 + 18 = 52 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially and he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces left. Therefore, Bobby still has 7 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Bobby had 22 pieces of candy at first and then he ate some more. He ate 3 pieces of candy after that. So, he has 22 + 3 = 25 pieces of candy now.
Response:  Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate 2 pieces. So, how many pieces of candy does he have left? That is, 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby has 17 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, then he has less than 32 pieces left. We don't know how many pieces he ate, but let's assume it was 10 pieces (just an estimate). So, now Bobby has 32 - 10 = 22 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 pieces of candy. Then he ate 17 pieces and still had 15 pieces left. So, if he initially had 36 pieces, then he must have had 36 - 17 = 19 pieces of candy left after eating 17 pieces.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 30 pieces of candy. Then he ate 23 pieces. So, how many pieces of candy does he have left? That means he has 7 pieces of candy left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  We know that Allan had 5 balls and Jake had 3 balls. So, we can write this information as an equation: A = 5 and J = 3. Now, let's compare these two numbers to find out how many more balls Allan had than Jake: A - J = 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Allan had 2 more balls than Jake in the park.
Response:  Allan had 2 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons after they left the park. So, Jake had more balloons than Allan at the end of their trip to the park. The difference between the number of balloons Allan had and the number of balloons Jake had is equal to 3 (the number of additional balloons Jake had). Therefore, Jake had 3 more balloons than Allan.
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balls to the park and then Jake also brought 3 balls after that, how many balls did Jake bring in total to the park? Therefore, the answer is 5 (2 + 3 = 5).
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balls to the park and then brought 4 more balls after that, how many balls did Allan bring to the park in total? So, the answer is 10 (6 + 4).
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 6 more than the number of balls that Allan brought, then Jake brought 11 balls to the park (6 + 5 = 11).
"Response: 
Allan had 3 balloons and brought 2 more to the park, so he had 5 balloons in total (3 + 2 = 5).
Jake had 5 balloons and then bought 2 more, so he had 7 balloons in total (5 + 2 = 7)."
"Response: 
Allan had 2 balloons and brought them to the park. Then he bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, Allan had 5 balloons (2 + 3) in total.
On the other hand, Jake had 4 balloons that he brought to the park. Therefore, Allan had more balloons than Jake in the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 5 - 4 = 1."
"Response: 
Allan had 2 balloons and brought 3 more to the park, so he had 5 balloons at the park (2 + 3 = 5).
Jake had 6 balloons initially and then bought 3 more, so he had 9 balloons in total (6 + 3 = 9).
Therefore, Jake had more balloons than Allan in the park - 9 vs 5."
"Response: 
Allan had 5 balls brought to the park and then he bought 3 more balls after that. So in total, Allan had 8 balls (5 + 3).
Therefore, the answer is 8."
"Response: 
Allan had 6 balloons and brought 2 to the park. So he had 8 balloons (6 + 2) at the park.
Jake bought 3 more balloons after arriving at the park. So Jake now has 5 + 3 = 8 balloons at the park.
Therefore, Allan had more balloons than Jake at the park - 8 vs 8."
"Response: 
Allan had 6 balloons at the park and then bought 3 more after that. So, he had a total of 9 balloons (6 + 3 = 9).
Jake had 3 balloons initially and later bought 4 more, so he had a total of 7 balloons (3 + 4 = 7).
Therefore, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan at the park."
Response:  Allan brought 5 balls to the park and then Jake bought 3 more balls after that. So, in total, Jake brought 6 + 3 = 9 balls to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan had 3 balls and Jake had 5 balls. So, together they had 8 balls (3 + 5). Now we are told that Jake brought 59 balls to the park. This means that he had 59 - 5 = 54 balls left after giving some to Allan. Therefore, Allan had 3 balls and Jake had 54 balls at the park.
Response:  We know that Allan had 7 balls and brought 5 of them to the park. So he had 7 - 5 = 2 balls left at home. Now we know that Jake had 6 balls and brought 4 of them to the park. So he had 6 - 4 = 2 balls left at home as well. Therefore, both Allan and Jake had 2 balls left at home after bringing some to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan had 5 balloons with him when he went to the park and then he and Jake brought 6 more balloons to the park together. So, in total, Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park.
"Response: 
Allan had 2 balls in the park and then bought 3 more. So, Allan had a total of 5 balls (2 + 3 = 5) in the park.
Jake brought 6 balls to the park after Allan already had his 5 balls there. Therefore, Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more ball than Allan in the park."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he studies English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent on Chinese from the total time spent on both languages. So, the difference is: 6 - 2 = 4 hours. Therefore, Ryan studies English for 4 more hours than he studies Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends on Chinese than on English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends on English from the total number of hours he spends on both languages. So, if we calculate this way, Ryan spends 13 hours (6 + 7) on both languages combined. Therefore, he spends 13 - 6 = 7 more hours on Chinese than on English.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and another few hours learning Chinese. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of days he spends learning Chinese (7 days) by the number of hours he spends learning it each day ($3$ hours). Therefore, Ryan spends $7 \times 3 = 21$ hours learning Chinese altogether.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan studies English for 7 hours per day and an additional few hours of Chinese. If he spends 2 more hours studying English than Chinese, then... (1 mark)
"Response:  Ryan studies Chinese for 5 hours per day and some additional hours of English. If he spends 2 more hours studying English than Chinese, then... (1 mark)

Instructions: Please provide your answer in the format of a numerical value or a mathematical expression. For example, you could write ""4"" to indicate that Ryan spends 4 hours studying English. Alternatively, you could write ""5 - 3 = 2"" to indicate that Ryan spends 2 hours studying English if he spends 5 hours studying Chinese."
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. For 5 days, he will spend a total of:

6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours on English
7 hours/day x 5 days = 35 hours on Chinese
So, in total, Ryan has spent 30 + 35 = 65 hours on both languages for those 5 days."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. For two days, he learns for a total of 10 hours (6 + 5). So, Ryan has spent a total of 10 hours learning both languages combined.
"Response:  Ryan studies English for 5 hours per day and Chinese for 4 hours per day. Since he has been studying for 6 days, he has studied a total of:

English = 5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours
Chinese = 4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours
Total hours studied = 30 + 24 = 54 hours
Therefore, Ryan has spent a total of 54 hours studying Chinese."
Response:  Since Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese, he studies for a total of 10 hours (4 + 6) per day. If he has been learning for 86 days, then he has studied for a total of 860 hours (10 x 86).
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, which means he learns for 12 hours in total (6 x 2 = 12). Similarly, he spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese and 3 hours per day learning Spanish, so he learns these languages for a total of 49 hours (7 x 2 + 3) and 21 hours (3 x 7), respectively. Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 82 hours (12 + 49 + 21) learning all three languages together.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which means he has studied for x number of days in total. Since he also studies Chinese and Spanish, we can assume that these are equal amounts of time spent each day (although this is not explicitly stated). So if he has studied English for x days, then he must have studied Chinese and Spanish for x days as well. Therefore, the total amount of time Ryan has spent studying all three languages combined is 6x hours. Now, to find out how many more hours he has spent studying English than Chinese, we simply subtract the number of hours he has spent studying Chinese from the total number of hours he has spent studying all three languages: 6x - 3x = 3x hours. So Ryan has spent 3x hours more studying English than Chinese.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English, 2 hours per day studying Chinese, and 4 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent studying Spanish from the time spent studying English. So, the difference is:

7 - 4 = 3

Therefore, Ryan spends 3 more hours studying English than Spanish."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English, which means he learns for 10 hours in total (2 x 5).
He also spends 4 hours per day learning Spanish, which means he learns for 20 hours in total (4 x 5).
So, Ryan has spent more time learning Chinese than Spanish, i.e., 30 hours (Chinese) > 20 hours (Spanish)."
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese. If he spends 2 hours per day learning English, then he has 1 hour left over to learn Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 x 7 = 28 hours per week learning English and 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week learning Chinese. In total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours per week studying both languages combined.
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 bags of chips. The next day, she found 7 more bags of chips. So, in total, she had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of chips on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she had 7 bags of chips. The next day, she found an additional 12 bags of chips. So, in total, she had 7 + 12 = 19 bags of chips on the second day.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 bottles of beer. The next day, she found some more bottles of beer and now has a total of 6 bottles. So, she found 2 additional bottles of beer on the second day.
Response:  On Monday, she had 2 pairs of glasses. That means she had 4 individual glasses (since each pair contains two glasses). So, in total, she had 4 + 4 = 8 glasses on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she had 10 pencils. Then, on Tuesday, she found 3 more pencils and on Wednesday, she found 7 more pencils. So, in total, she had 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 pencils.
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 bags of chips. Then, on Tuesday, she found 10 more bags, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 bags of chips. Finally, on Wednesday, she found 4 more bags, bringing the total number of bags to 18 + 4 = 22 bags of chips. Therefore, she found a total of 22 bags of chips after Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she had 3 small boxes of chocolates. The next day, she found an additional 7 small boxes and 44 large bottles of chocolate. So, in total, she had 3 + 7 = 10 small boxes of chocolates and 44 + 7 = 51 large bottles of chocolate. Therefore, she had a total of 10 + 51 = 61 pieces of chocolate.
"Response:  We have 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples there are than green apples, we need to subtract the number of green apples from the total number of apples. So, the answer is:
More red apples = Total apples - Green apples = 17 + 16 = 33
Therefore, there are 33 more red apples than green apples in the basket."
Response:  There are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. So, the answer is: 11 - 5 = 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are ten red apples and some green apples in the basket. If there are 15 apples in total in the basket, then we can say that the number of red apples is equal to half of the total number of apples minus the number of green apples. So, if we subtract the number of green apples from half of the total number of apples, we get: Half of 15 = 7.5 - Number of green apples = 7.5 - x where x is the number of green apples. Since we don't know the exact value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of green apples in the basket. However, based on the information provided in the question, we can conclude that there must be at least one green apple in the basket since there are already ten red apples present.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red pears and some green pears in the basket. If there are more green pears than red pears in the basket, then we can say that the number of green pears is greater than or equal to the number of red pears. So, let's assume that there are x green pears in the basket. Since there are 10 more green pears than red pears, we can write an equation: x = 10 + 3 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 green pears in the basket.
Response:  We have 7 red peppers (rooi), 15 yellow peppers (geel) and 8 green peppers (groen). In total we have 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 peppers in the basket.
Response:  We have 7 red peppers (rooi perske), which means we have 7 x 3 = 21 green peppers (geel perske). So, there are more green peppers than red peppers. Therefore, the number of green peppers minus the number of red peppers is equal to the total number of peppers in the jar. In this case, that would be 8 - 21 = -13 green peppers.
"Response:  We have 6 geel perske and 14 groen perske in the jar. To find out how many more green persimmons there are than orange persimmons, we need to subtract the number of orange persimmons from the total number of persimmons in the jar. So, the answer is:
More green persimmons = Total number of persimmons - Number of orange persimmons = 14 + 6 = 20"
"Response:  We have 19 red peppers and 11 yellow peppers in the basket. To find out how many more red peppers than yellow peppers are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of yellow peppers from the total number of peppers. So, the answer is:
More red peppers = 19 - 11 = 8"
Response:  We have 6 red peppers and 90 yellow peppers in the basket. If we multiply these numbers together, we get 540 (6 x 90 = 540). Now, we add 16 green peppers to this total, which gives us 556 (540 + 16 = 556). So, there are 556 peppers in the basket altogether - 328 of them are red, 178 are yellow, and 50 are green.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red peppers and 14 yellow peppers in the basket. The total number of peppers is therefore 32 (18 + 14). Since we also know that there are 17 green peppers in the basket, we can deduce that the total number of peppers in the basket is 59 (32 + 17). So, there are 17 yellow peppers in the basket.
Response:  We have 5 red peppers and 14 yellow peppers in the basket. Therefore, we have a total of 19 peppers in the basket (5 + 14 = 19). Since there are 6 green peppers in the basket, we can conclude that there are 13 green peppers left after adding all the other peppers (19 - 6 = 13). So, there are 13 green peppers in the basket.
Response:  There are 65 mandjies per Persian cat. Each mandjie has 7 red cats and 3 green cats. So, there are 7 + 3 = 10 cats in each mandjie. Therefore, there are 65 x 10 = 650 cats in total.
Response:  There are 11 mandjies. Each mandjie has 10 red peppers and 18 green peppers. So, there are 10 x 10 = 100 red peppers and 18 x 11 = 208 green peppers in total. Therefore, there are 100 + 208 = 308 peppers in the 11 mandjies.
Response:  We know that there are 6 mandjies and each mandjie has 16 red persian cats. So, the total number of red persian cats is 6 x 16 = 96. Additionally, we know that each mandjie also has 18 green persian cats. Therefore, the total number of green persian cats is 6 x 18 = 108. In conclusion, there are 96 + 108 = 204 persian cats in total.
Response:  There are 7 mandjies. Each mandjie has 10 red peppers and 2 green peppers. So, there are 7 x 10 = 70 red peppers and 2 x 7 = 14 green peppers in total. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 peppers in the 7 mandjies.
Response:  There are 2 pairs of mice. Each pair has 4 red mice and 3 green mice. Therefore, there are 2 x 2 = 4 pairs of mice. And each pair has 4 + 3 = 7 mice. So, there are 4 x 7 = 28 mice in total.
Response:  There are 2 mandjies of peppers. Each mandjie has 4 red peppers and some green peppers. Since there are 12 peppers in all, how many green peppers are there in each mandjie? We can find this out by dividing the total number of peppers (12) by the number of mandjies (2). So, there are 6 green peppers in each mandjie.
Response:  We know that there are 16 penguins in the jar and 13 of them are red. So, we have to find out how many green penguins are left. The number of green penguins can be calculated as follows: Total number of penguins - Number of red penguins = Number of green penguins In this case, the total number of penguins is 16 (as mentioned in the question), and the number of red penguins is 13. Therefore, the number of green penguins in the jar is: 16 - 13 = 3 So, there are 3 green penguins in the jar.
"Response:  We are given that there are 19 red mice and 4 green mice. If we assume that each mouse has 5 kittens (as suggested in the question), then... See full solution

Solution: To find out how many kittens are in each of the 15 mouse groups, we need to divide the total number of kittens (20 + 4 = 24) by the number of mouse groups (15). So, each group of mice contains approximately 1.6 kittens (round down to the nearest whole number)."
Response:  There are 10 penguins that Eunice spreads in some boxes. Each box has 4 red penguins and 6 green penguins. How many boxes do the penguins add up to?
Response:  We have 6 green peppers (60), 6 red peppers (2), and total of 62 peppers in the jar. To find out how many more green peppers than red peppers are in the jar, we can subtract the number of red peppers from the total number of peppers: 62 - 2 = 59. So there are 59 more green peppers than red peppers in the jar.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf initially. He then added some more action figures to the shelf later. Since there are already 8 action figures on the shelf, and he added some more, we can conclude that Jerry has added a total of x action figures to the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures Jerry has added to the shelf is x = 12 (since there were already 8 on the shelf).
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. He then took 3 of them off and put them away later. So he had 7 action figures left on the shelf. Since there are already 10 action figures on the shelf, Jerry must have had 3 action figures on the shelf initially. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf is 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, there were 10 action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had initially 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures is now 12 (5 + 7). The total number of books remains unchanged at 9. Therefore, there are 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf (12 - 9 = 3).
Response:  Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures is now 6 (2 + 4). The total number of books remains unchanged at 10. Therefore, the ratio of books to action figures is still 10:6 or 2:1.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of books on the shelf after adding the new ones is: 9 + 10 = 19 books. Therefore, there were 19 books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf is 7 + 4 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 things (action figures and books) on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf now is 5 + 2 + 9 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 - 5 = 11 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures on a shelf in his room and then he took 4 of them off the shelf and put 5 old ones away. So, there were initially 8 + 4 = 12 action figures on the shelf. Then, 5 old ones were taken away, leaving 7 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, there were 7 action figures left on the shelf after Jerry put some away.
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he took 4 of them off and put them away. So, there are now 3 - 4 = 2 action figures left on the shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he added some more and removed 10 of the old ones. So, there are now 8 action figures on the shelf. To find out how many action figures Jerry has added to the shelf, we need to subtract the number of old action figures that were removed from the total number of new action figures added. Therefore, the answer is: 8 - 10 = 2 action figures have been added to the shelf by Jerry.
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. He then took 2 of them off and put 7 old ones back. Now there are 10 action figures on the shelf. So, to find out how many action figures Jerry had initially, we can subtract the number he took off from the total number now: 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf initially.
Response:  Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf initially and then he added another 7 action figures to it later. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had is 9 + 7 = 16. Now, we are asked how many more action figures than books Jerry had on his shelf. Since Jerry had 10 books on his shelf, the difference between the number of action figures and books is 16 - 10 = 6. Therefore, there were 6 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf now is 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 - 3 = 4 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf is now 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence and six more birds coming to join them. So, in total, we have eight birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are still four birds left who want to come and sit on the fence.
Response:  There were four birds on the fence initially. Now there are five birds on the fence. So, if we assume that the initial number of birds on the fence was x, then the number of birds that joined later is 5 - x. Therefore, the total number of birds on the fence at the beginning was x + (5 - x) = 10.
Response:  We have 46 owls and 6 more birds that are connected to them. So, in total we have 52 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds (voels) and two owls (ooievaars). So far, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds (three voeels) sitting on the fence and four ostriches (four ooievaars). Two more vultures are attached to them. So in total we have five birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds and an owl sitting on the fence. Three more birds are connected to them. So in total we have five birds (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, there are three more owls than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds (voels) and two owls (ooievaards). So in total we have six birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds (voels) and four owls (ooievaars). So we need to find out how many birds are sitting on the fence in total. The number of birds that can sit on the fence is equal to the sum of the number of voels and ooievaars. Therefore, the answer is: 3 + 4 = 7 birds sit on the fence.
Response:  We have 6 birds (voels) and 3 owls (ooievaards). If we add two more owls who joined later, then the total number of birds sitting on the fence is: 6 + 2 = 8 voels. So, there are 8 bird(s) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds (voels) sitting on the fence and three owls joining them. So, in total we have... (4 + 3 =) 7 birds sitting on the fence!
Response:  We have four birds sitting on the branch (voels). And eight owls are attached to them (ooievaars). So, in total we have... (thinking)...12 birds sitting on that branch!
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence and five more birds joining them. That means there are seven birds in total sitting on the fence. Now, we are told that four owls have joined them. So, the total number of birds including the owls is seven + four = eleven birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds sitting on the fence. If two more birds join them, there will be five birds in total (3 + 2 = 5). Now, if six owls join them, there will be eleven birds in total (5 + 6 = 11). So, the number of owls is equal to the number of birds minus the number of birds that are already sitting on the fence. In this case, the number of owls is 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, eight owls join the three birds who are already sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have five birds (ooievaars) sitting on the fence, and three sparrows (voëls). So far, we have eight creatures (birds + sparrows) sitting on the fence. If four more sparrows join them, then there will be thirteen creatures (birds + sparrows) sitting on the fence in total. Therefore, the correct answer is thirteen.
Response:  We have 6 owls and 2 birds sitting on that branch. Three more birds are attached to it. So in total, we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on that branch.
Response:  We know that three birds are sitting on the fence and six more have joined them. So, in total, we have nine birds (3 + 6 = 9) sitting on the fence. Now, let's consider the two owls who have also joined them. Therefore, there are ten birds (9 + 2 = 10) sitting on the fence.
Response:  The first section has 48 pages long and the second part has 11 pages long. To find out how many more pages are in the first section than in the second section, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second section from the number of pages in the first section. So, the difference between the two sections is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first section has 37 more pages than the second section.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages long and the second chapter has 80 pages long. So we can write an equation like this: 37 + x = 80 where x represents the number of extra pages in the second chapter compared to the first chapter. Now we need to solve for x. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 37: x = 80 / 37 = 2.16 or approximately 2 pages more than the first chapter. Therefore, the second chapter has 2 pages more than the first chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 60 pages long, and there are total 93 pages in the book. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter Number of pages in second chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages
Response:  We know that there are two main sections to the book, and the second section has 36 pages long. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in the first section as follows: Number of pages in the first section = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the second section Number of pages in the second section = 36 pages Long So, if there are 67 pages in total, then the number of pages in the first section would be: Number of pages in the first section = 67 pages - 36 pages = 31 pages
Response:  The first chapter has 66 pages long, the second chapter has 35 pages long and the third chapter has 24 pages long. So, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = First Chapter Pages + Second Chapter Pages + Third Chapter Pages Total Number of Pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages Therefore, the book has 125 pages in total.
"Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the answer is:

First chapter - Second chapter = 91 - 23 = 68 pages
Therefore, the first chapter has 68 pages more than the second chapter."
"Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and we know that it takes up more space than the third chapter because it has more pages. So let's assume that each page of the second chapter takes up half the space of a page in the first chapter. Therefore, if the first chapter has x pages, then the second chapter will have 0.5x pages, and the third chapter will have 0.25x pages. Now we can calculate the number of pages in each section using these proportions:

* First chapter: x = 35 pages
* Second chapter: 0.5x = 18 pages
* Third chapter: 0.25x = 7 pages

So the second chapter has 18 pages, which is more than the third chapter with 7 pages."
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages more than the third chapter. So we can write this equation: 53 = x where x is the number of pages in the third chapter. Now we know that the total number of pages in all three chapters together is equal to 149 (the sum of the page numbers given in the problem). Therefore, we can write another equation: 149 = 53 + x Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: 53 = x - x = 0 Solving for x, we find that there are 22 pages in the third chapter. So the answer to the question is: The first chapter has 53 pages more than the third chapter, which means the third chapter has 22 pages fewer than the first chapter.
"Response:  The book has 31 chapters, and each chapter has 61 pages long. Therefore, we can write:
Total number of pages = Number of chapters x Length of each chapter
= 31 x 61
= 1931 pages
So, the total number of pages in the book is 1931 pages."
Response:  The first chapter has 10 pages long, so we can say that it consists of 10/23 = 42% of the total number of pages. Therefore, there are 23 - 42% = 15 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 81 pages long and the second chapter has 68 pages long. So, we need to find out how many pages are there in the second chapter. To do this, we divide the length of the second chapter (68) by the number of pages per chapter (81). Therefore, the answer is: 81 / 68 = 1.25 or approximately 130 pages.
Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing is 62. In the afternoon, 39 more campers went rowing. So, the total number of campers who went rowing in both morning and afternoon = 62 + 39 = 101 campers.
Response:  The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is 52 and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is 61. So, we can say that there are 61 - 52 = 9 more campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that there are 15 campers who will go rowing in the morning and another pair of campers who will go rowing in the afternoon. So, we have a total of 17 campers going rowing that day.
Response:  We have 7 campers who went for a row in the afternoon and 60 campers who will go for a row that day. So, if we want to know how many campers will go for a row that morning, we can multiply the number of campers who went for a row in the afternoon by 2 (since there are two timeslots). Therefore, the answer is 14 (7 x 2 = 14).
Response:  The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is 13 + 36 = 49. Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing is 49.
"Response:  The number of campers who went fishing in the morning is 44 and in the afternoon it is 39. So, the difference between the number of campers who went fishing in the morning and those who went in the afternoon is:

44 - 39 = 5
Therefore, 5 more campers went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning."
"Response:  We know that 53 campers arrived early and 48 campers arrived late. So, we have to find out how many more campers arrived early than late. To do this, we need to subtract the number of campers who arrived late from the number of campers who arrived early:

Number of campers who arrived early - Number of campers who arrived late = More campers who arrived early

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

53 - 48 = 5

So, there were 5 more campers who arrived early than late."
Response:  The number of campers who went fishing that morning was 33 and the number of campers who went fishing that afternoon was 34. So, the total number of campers who went fishing that day is: 33 + 34 = 67. Now, let's find out how many more campers went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning: 67 - 33 = 34. Therefore, there were 34 more campers who went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went rowing and 59 campers went for a walk in the morning. In the afternoon, 21 campers went rowing. So, we can calculate the total number of campers who went rowing as follows: Total = Morning + Afternoon = 13 + 21 = 34 campers. Therefore, 34 campers went rowing in total.
"Response:  We know that 29 campers went rowing and 66 campers went for a walk in the morning. In the afternoon, 26 campers went for a swim. So, we need to find out how many more campers went for a swim than those who went for a walk in the morning. To do this, we can subtract the number of campers who went for a walk from the total number of campers who went for a swim:

Number of campers who went for a swim = 26
Number of campers who went for a walk = 66 - 29 = 37

So, there were 37 more campers who went for a swim than those who went for a walk in the morning."
Response:  The total number of campers who went rowing and hiked is equal to the sum of the number of campers who went rowing each day plus the number of campers who hiked each day. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Number = Rowing Day 1 + Rowing Day 2 + Hiking Day. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total Number = 41 (rowing) + 4 (hiking) = 45. Therefore, there were 45 campers in total who went rowing and hiking.
Response:  We know that 46 campers went for a day trip and 43 of them went rowing in the morning. So, we have to find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon. The number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is equal to the total number of campers minus the number of campers who went rowing in the morning. Therefore, the answer is: Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = Total number of campers - Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 46 - 43 = 3.
Response:  The tree had 7 apples initially and Rachel picked 4 of them. So, there are still 3 apples left on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples (4). Then she plucked some and now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, Rachel has plucked 2 apples from the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree and now there are 5 apples left on the tree. Out of these 5 apples, 3 are ripe, so the number of unripe apples is 2 (5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, the total number of ripe apples on the tree is 3 + 2 = 5 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from her tree and now there are 7 apples left on the tree. Of those 7 apples, 6 are ripe, so we can say that the total number of ripe apples the tree had at the beginning was 6 + 1 = 7. Therefore, the tree had 7 ripe apples to start with.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree. Now, the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples. So, to start with, the tree had 6 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree, so the tree had 3 - 3 = 0 ripe apples left. Then, the tree produced 2 more ripe apples, so it had 0 + 2 = 2 ripe apples left. Finally, the tree produced 27 unripe apples, so it had 2 - 2 = 0 ripe apples left. Therefore, the tree had 0 ripe apples at the beginning.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Then she planted two new apples on that same tree. Now there are still 6 apples left on the tree. So, to start with, the tree had 7 + 2 = 9 apples.
Response:  Rachel had 2 apples initially and picked 4 from her tree. Then, 3 new apples grew on the tree after that. So, in total, there are now 7 apples (2 + 4 + 3) on Rachel's tree.
Response:  If Rachel had 52 apple trees and she picked 2 apples from one of them, then there are still 7 apples left on that tree. So, in total, Rachel has 52 x 7 = 364 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 8 apples from each of the 3 trees, so she got 24 apples in total. Now, there are still 9 apples left on each tree, which means that initially, there were 9 x 3 = 27 apples on all the trees together.
Response:  Rachel picked 7 apples from each of the 4 trees, so she picked a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. Now, there are still 29 apples left on the trees, which means that Rachel has collected all of them. Therefore, the total number of apples Rachel has is 29 - 28 = 1 apple. So, the answer is 1 apple.
Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. So, if Doug lost some of his knick-knacks on the playground, then Ed must have gained an equal number of knick-knacks. Therefore, we can say that Ed has 19 more knick-knacks than Doug. Now, to find out how many knick-knacks Doug lost, we need to subtract the number of knick-knacks he already had from the total number of knick-knacks he now has. So, Doug lost 17 knick-knacks (19 - 2 = 17).
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more knickers than Doug. So, if Doug had 11 knickers on the playground and lost them all, then he would have none left. Now, we need to find out how many knickers Ed had. According to the question, Ed had 45 knickers. Therefore, the difference between the number of knickers Ed had and the number of knickers Doug had is 34 (45 - 11).
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. So, if Doug lost 7 of his marbles on the playground, then he must have had x marbles initially. Since Ed had 22 marbles and gave 6 to Doug, Ed now has 22 - 6 = 16 marbles left. Therefore, Doug lost 7 + 6 = 13 marbles in total.
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. So, if Doug had 3 marbles lost on the ground, then Ed had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles initially.
"Response:  We know that Ed had more knick-knacks than Doug because he lost fewer of them on the playing field (24 vs 27). So, if Ed had x knick-knacks and Doug had y knick-knacks, we can set up the equation:
x - 24 = y - 27
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 24 to both sides of the equation:
x = y + 24
Substituting y with 9 (the number of knick-knacks Doug had), we get:
x = 9 + 24
x = 33
Therefore, Ed had 33 more knick-knacks than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more knickers than Doug. If Ed lost 17 of his knickers on the playground, then he must have had initially 46 (29 + 17) knickers. Therefore, Ed had 46 knickers more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more knickers than Doug. So, if Doug had x knickers, then Ed had 19 + x knickers. Now we are told that Ed lost some of his knickers on the playground. This means that Ed has fewer knickers now than he did before. So, the number of knickers Ed lost is equal to the difference between the number of knickers he had before and the number he has now. In other words, the number of knickers Ed lost is 8 - (19 + x). Substituting x = 8, we get 8 - 27 = -19. Therefore, Ed lost 19 knickers on the playground.
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more knickers than Doug. So, if Doug had 21 knickers on the playground, then Ed had 51 knickers (30 + 21 = 51).
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more knickers than Doug. So, if Ed had 12 + x = 35 knickers (where x is the number of knickers Doug had), then we can deduce that Doug had x = 23 knickers. Therefore, Doug now has 20 - 23 = -3 knickers less than he initially had.
"Response:  The number of students who suggested adding applesauce to their meal is 408, while the number of students who suggested adding sausage to their meal is 42. Therefore, more students suggested adding applesauce than sausage. In numerical terms, we can represent this as follows:

Number of students suggesting applesauce = 408
Number of students suggesting sausage = 42
So, the difference between these two numbers is:
Difference = Number of students suggesting applesauce - Number of students suggesting sausage
= 408 - 42
= 366
Therefore, 366 more students suggested adding applesauce to their meals than suggested adding sausage."
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to their meal is 479 and the number of students who suggested adding sausage to their meal is 489. Therefore, more students (489) suggested adding sausage than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes (479). So, the difference between these two numbers is 10 (489 - 479).
Response:  The total number of students is 310. Of those, 185 students preferred to add mashed potatoes to their meal, while 123 students preferred to add bacon (spek in Afrikaans). Therefore, there are 123 students who preferred bacon.
Response:  The total number of students is 288. Of those, 264 students preferred to add bacon to their meal, while 24 students preferred to add applesauce. Therefore, the number of students who preferred to add applesauce is 24.
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding applesauce to their meal is 457, while the number of students who suggested adding sausage to their meal is 63. So, the number of students who suggested adding sausage is less than half (i.e., 63/457 = 0.138) of the total number of students who made suggestions.
"Response:  The number of students who preferred applesauce is 182, while the number of students who preferred bacon is 166. So, if we want to find out how many more students preferred bacon than applesauce, we can subtract these two numbers:

166 - 182 = -16

Therefore, there are 16 more students who preferred bacon than applesauce."
Response:  The total number of students is 324. Of those, 374 students suggested adding cheese to their meal plan and 128 students suggested adding tomatoes. So, we can conclude that 374 + 128 = 502 students participated in the survey.
"Response:  The number of students who suggested adding applesauce to their meal is 257, and the number of students who suggested adding sausage to their meal is 120. Therefore, the ratio of students who preferred applesauce to those who preferred sausage is:

Number of students who preferred applesauce / Number of students who preferred sausage = 257/120 = 2.13
So, there are approximately 2.13 times more students who preferred applesauce than those who preferred sausage."
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding applesauce to their meal is 144, and the number of students who suggested adding sausage to their meal is 467. Therefore, more students suggested adding applesauce than sausage. Specifically, 323 (144 + 467) students suggested adding applesauce, while 223 (79 + 467) students suggested adding sausage.
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding applesauce to their meal is 228, and the number of students who suggested adding sausage to their meal is 337. Therefore, more students suggested adding sausage than added applesauce. Specifically, 337 - 228 = 109 more students suggested adding sausage than added applesauce.
"Response:  The total number of students is 450 and they were asked to choose from 66 options for specific dishes. If 38 students chose ""spek"" (which means bacon in Afrikaans) and 12 students did not participate in the survey, then we can calculate the percentage of students who chose ""spek"" as follows:

(Number of students who chose ""spek"") / Total number of students = Percentage of students who chose ""spek""
= 38 / 450 x 100%
= 8.4%
Therefore, approximately 8.4% of the 450 students chose ""spek""."
Response:  The total number of students is 218 + 351 = 579. Now, let's calculate how many students wanted to add meat to their meals: 218 students voted for puree and 351 students voted for meat, which means that 579 - (218 + 351) = 40 students did not vote for either option. Therefore, 40 students did not want to add any meat or puree to their meals.
"Response:  The number of students who suggested adding applesauce to their meal is 330, and the number of students who suggested adding tamarinds is 76. So, we can say that the ratio of students who preferred applesauce to those who preferred tamarind is:

Number of students who preferred applesauce : Number of students who preferred tamarind = 330 : 76 = 4.3 : 1
Therefore, for every one student who preferred tamarind, four students preferred applesauce."
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 841 - 34 = 807. So, there are 807 more boys than girls at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 learners at this school and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys = Total learner - Number of girls. = 485 - 232 = 253 boys. Therefore, there are 253 boys in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls and 228 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we want to find out how many boys there are in the school, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we want to find out how many boys there are in the school, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 635 + 510 = 1145. Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 girls and 507 boys in the school. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys - Number of boys = 868 + 507 - 507 = 308 Therefore, there are 308 learners in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we want to find out how many learners there are in total, we can use the following equation: Total number of learners = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) To solve this problem, we need to substitute the values given in the question into the equation above. Here are the values: Number of girls = 700 Number of boys = 142 + 700 = 842 Now let's plug these values into the equation: Total number of learners = 700 + (842 - 700) = 1420 Therefore, there are 1420 learners in the school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 706 girls and 222 boys at school. If 418 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Similarly, if 418 more boys join the school, then the total number of boys will be 222 + 418 = 640 boys. Therefore, the total number of students in the school now is 1124 + 640 = 1764 students.
Response:  We know that there are currently 902 girls and 811 boys at school. If 44 more girls join the school, then the number of girls will increase to 946 (902 + 44). So, now there are 946 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 632 girls and 410 boys in school. Additionally, 465 more girls have joined the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls: 632 - 410 = 222. So, there are 222 more girls than boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in total at school. This means that 682 girls (or 90%) have joined the school. So, now there are 50 girls left out of the original 732 girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 732 - 50 = 682 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys at school initially. Then, we learn that 496 girls and 910 boys have joined the school. So, the total number of boys at the school now is: 214 + 910 = 1124 boys. Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. If we add these numbers together, we get 626 students in total (308 + 318). Since there are also 36 teachers at the school, the number of learners per teacher is: 626 / 36 = 17.5 learners per teacher. So, there are approximately 17.5 learners per teacher in this school.
Response:  We are given that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. To find out how many people are in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys together. So, the total number of people in the school is: 315 + 309 = 624. Therefore, there are 624 people in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 402 girls more than boys in the school. So, if there are 739 girls in the school, then there must be 337 boys in the school. Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 458 more girls than boys in school. So, if there are 692 girls in total, then there must be 692 - 458 = 234 boys in total. Therefore, there are 234 + 458 = 692 learners in the school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 362 boys in school and 257 girls in school. Additionally, we know that 403 more girls have joined the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are at the school, we can use the following equation: Number of girls = Total number of girls + Number of new girls - Number of boys. Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Number of girls = 362 + 403 - 362 = 198. Therefore, there are 198 more girls than boys at the school.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $ 18 and spent $ 16. So he has $ 18 - $ 16 = $ 2 left now. Therefore, Edward now has $ 2.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $ 13 and then he gave some money away. So, he has less money now. Secondly, he has $ 3 left after giving money away. Therefore, Edward spent $ 10 ( $ 13 - $ 3).
Response:  According to the problem statement, Edward had $ 9 initially and then he spent $ 8 more. So, after spending $ 8, his balance was $ 17 - $ 8 = $ 9. Therefore, Edward had $ 9 before he spent any money.
"Response:  If Edward had $16 to buy 92 books and he spent $6 after buying them, then we can calculate how much money he had before spending it as follows:

$16 - $6 = $10
So, Edward had $10 before spending any money."
Response:  If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, that means each book cost him $3. Now he spends $12 for 4 books, so each book costs him $3 + ($12 - $6) / 4 = $3.50. Therefore, each book costs $3.50.
Response:  We know that Edward had $6 for books and $16 for pens before he spent any money. So, his total amount of money was $6 + $16 = $22. Now, we are told that Edward has $19 now. Therefore, he must have spent $22 - $19 = $3 in total.
Response:  We know that Edward had $ 4 in books and $ 3 in pens at first. So he spent $ 4 + $ 3 = $ 7 on books and pens together. Now he has $ 12. Therefore, we can say that Edward has $ 12 - $ 7 = $ 5 left in both books and pens.
Response:  If Edward spent $ 16 on books and $ 8 on pasta, then he has $ 16 + $ 8 = $ 24 left after buying both items. Now, if he spent an additional $ 19 on books, that means he has $ 24 - $ 19 = $ 5 left after buying books. So, Edward has more money left after buying books than he does after buying pasta. The difference is $ 5.
Response:  Before he spent money, Edward had $17. Then his friend gave him $10, so now he has $27 ($17 + $10). Now he spent $7, so he has $20 left ($27 - $7). Therefore, Edward had $17 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 more than Zachary. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 44 + 58 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary and David together did 102 push-ups.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. So we can write this as an equation: 
Zachary = 51
David = 44
Now we want to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David. To do this, we subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 
Difference = Zachary - David = 51 - 44 = 7
So Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David."
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did 44 + 9 = 53 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 53 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 more push-ups, so together they did 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches. David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, which means he did 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. However, we also know that David did 27 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. David did more than Zachary but fewer than him. So we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 44 but less than or equal to 61 (since he did 29 more than Zachary). Also, since David did fewer crunches than Zachary, we can say that David did y crunches where y is less than or equal to 17 (since David did 13 fewer crunches than Zachary). Now we have two equations: x + y = 61 and x > 44. Can you solve for x and y now?
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. David did more push-ups than Zachary (17 more), but fewer crunches (10 less). So we can write an equation based on this information:
Zachary = 53 + 14
David = Zachary + 17 - 10
Now we need to solve for Zachary's push-ups and crunches. To do this, we can add the two equations together:
(Zachary + David) = 60
Subtracting 53 from both sides gives us:
29 = 14 + 17 - 10
Simplifying this equation gives us:
29 = 23
So Zachary did 29 push-ups and 23 crunches."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary but 87 fewer crunches than Zachary. So, if we subtract 87 from 58, we get 31. Therefore, Zachary did 35 + 3 = 38 push-ups and 3 - 87 = -84 crunches more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and David did 38 more than Zachary. So, David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. Now we are told that David did 62 fewer crunches than Zachary. This means that if Zachary did x crunches, then David did x - 62 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 58 crunches (since he did 46 push-ups). So, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches done by Zachary is 46 - 58 = -12.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 39 + 19 = 58 push-ups. Since John did 13 fewer push-ups than David, John did 58 - 13 = 45 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups, and David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Now we are told that John did fewer push-ups than David, so John did 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups. Therefore, John did 69 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 54 push-ups (39 + 15). Now we know that John did 9 fewer push-ups than David. Therefore, John did 45 push-ups (54 - 9). Finally, we want to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. To do this, we subtract the number of push-ups John did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 54 - 45 = 9. So, Zachary did 9 more push-ups than John.
Response:  If David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary, that means Zachary did x push-ups initially. So, if David did 37 push-ups, then Zachary did x + 30 = 37 push-ups initially.
Response:  We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 56 push-ups together. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 56 = 56 (since David did 56 more push-ups). Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 0. So Zachary did no push-ups at all, and David did 56 push-ups alone.
Response:  We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer crunches than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches, then David did 34 + 40 = 74 push-ups and 62 - 17 = 45 crunches.
Response:  According to the information provided, David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary (36 - 27 = 9). However, Zachary did 33 fewer crunches than David (33 - 60 = -27). So, if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then he did 21 more push-ups than crunches (58 - 33 = 25).
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 5 push-ups, then David did 32 (27 + 5) push-ups. Now, we are told that David did 7 fewer crunches than Zachary. If Zachary did 17 crunches, then David did 10 (17 - 7) crunches. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches done by David is 32 - 10 = 22.
"Response:  If Rachel completed 5 bladse (pages) of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework, then she had a total of 7 bladsye (pages). So, if math homework is more than reading homework, we can say that Rachel had x more pages of math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading homework is equal to x. 
So, the answer is 7 - x = x."
Response:  If Rachel completed 3 bladsye (or difficult) math homework and 4 bladsye reading homework, we can say that she did more reading homework than math homework. So, the difference between the number of bladsye homework in each subject is equal to the number of bladsye reading homework minus the number of bladsye math homework. In this case, the difference would be 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, Rachel did 1 more bladsye reading homework than math homework.
"Response:  If Rachel completed 5 pieces of advanced math homework and still has more to read, then she must have completed x pieces of additional homework. Since she had 7 total pieces of homework to complete, we can set up the equation:
x + 5 = 7
Now solve for x:
x = 2
So Rachel had 2 additional pieces of homework to read after completing the 5 advanced math problems."
Response:  If Rachel completed 7 pieces of advanced math homework and she had to complete 4 more pieces of math homework as reading comprehension work, then we can calculate how many total pieces of math homework she had to complete in total. So, the answer is 7 + 4 = 11 pieces of math homework.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 pieces of advanced math homework and she had to complete 3 more pieces of math homework as reading comprehension work, then we can calculate how many total pieces of math homework she had to complete. So, the total number of pieces of math homework that Rachel had to complete is: 8 + 3 = 11.
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 pieces of math homework and she had to complete 6 more pieces of math homework, then we can calculate how many total pieces of math homework she had to complete. So, in this case, Rachel had to complete 8 + 6 = 14 pieces of math homework.
Response:  If Rachel completed 10 pieces of advanced math homework and she had to complete 3 more pieces of math homework, then she has to complete a total of 13 pieces of math homework (10 + 3 = 13).
Response:  Rachel had to complete 2 pieces of advanced math homework and 3 pieces of reading comprehension homework. In total, she had to do 5 pieces of homework. Then, for biology, she had to do 10 pieces of homework. So, in total, Rachel had to do 15 pieces of homework.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 9 pages of math homework and read 2 pages of reading homework. Additionally, she had 96 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages of math homework Rachel had than reading homework, we can subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the total number of pages of math homework. So, if we do that, we get:
Pages of math homework = 9
Pages of reading homework = 2
Total pages of math homework = 9 + 2 = 11
So, Rachel had 11 pages more of math homework than reading homework."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 11 pages of math homework and read 2 pages of math reading material. Additionally, she had 3 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages of math homework Rachel had than biology homework, we can subtract the number of pages of biology homework from the total number of pages of math homework. So, if we do this calculation, we get: Total pages of math homework = 11 + 2 = 13 pages Biology homework = 3 pages Therefore, there are 10 pages (13 - 3) more pages of math homework than biology homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 7 pages of math homework and read 11 pages of reading homework. Additionally, she had 8 pages of science homework. To find out how many more pages of science homework than math homework Rachel had, we can subtract the number of pages of math homework from the number of pages of science homework: 8 - 7 = 1 page. So, Rachel had one more page of science homework than math homework.
Response:  Rachel completed 9 pages of math homework and read 11 pages of reading homework. To find out how many pages she had to complete in total, we can add these two numbers together: 9 + 11 = 20. So, Rachel had to complete 20 pages of homework in total.
Response:  Rachel completed 8 pages of math homework and read 7 pages of reading homework. That means she has 1 page left to complete in each subject (math and reading). For biology, she completed 3 pages and has 5 pages left to complete. So, in total, Rachel needs to complete 1 + 1 + 5 = 7 more pages of homework in each subject.
Response:  Rachel completed 5 pages of math homework and read 10 pages of reading homework. She also had to complete 6 pages of biology homework. So in total, she had to do 5 + 10 = 15 pages of homework.
Response:  Rachel completed 2 pieces of reading homework and 4 pieces of math homework. To find out how many more math homeworks she had than reading homeworks, we need to subtract the number of reading homeworks from the number of math homeworks. So, the answer is: 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, Rachel had 2 more math homeworks than reading homeworks.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 7 pages of math homework and 19 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages of math homework she had than reading homework, we can subtract the number of pages of biology homework from the total number of pages of homework she completed:

Number of pages of math homework = 7
Total number of pages of homework = 7 + 19 = 26

So, Rachel had 26 - 7 = 19 more pages of math homework than reading homework."
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 e-posse and in the afternoon he received 2 more e-posse. So, the total number of e-posse that Jack received is: 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, Jack received 8 e-posse in total.
"Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 e-posse and in the afternoon he received 8 e-posse. So, we can write this as follows:
Morning = 6 e-posse
Afternoon = 8 e-posse - 6 e-posse = 2 e-posse
Therefore, Jack received more e-posse in the afternoon than in the morning by 2 e-posse."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and another few in the afternoon. So, let's assume he received x emails in the afternoon. Since he received 5 emails per day, we can write an equation as follows: x + 4 = 5. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 1. Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and then he received 3 more emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails Jack received that day is: 6 + 3 = 9. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails per day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and in the afternoon he received 8 emails. So, the total number of emails Jack received is: 5 + 8 = 13.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and then he received 5 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails Jack received in the morning is 4. Then, he received an additional 5 emails in the afternoon, so the total number of emails Jack received that day is 4 + 5 = 9 emails. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails in the midday and afternoon combined.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and in the afternoon he received 4 emails, so the total number of emails Jack received is: 3 + 4 = 7 emails.
Response:  According to the information provided, Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 17 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 27 emails (10 + 17). Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 9 emails and in the afternoon he received 10 emails. So, the total number of emails Jack received is: 9 + 10 = 19 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and then he received 5 more emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails Jack received is 10 + 5 = 15. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  If Jack received three emails in the morning and another few in the afternoon, he received a total of 3 + x emails that day, where x is the number of emails he received in the afternoon. Since we are asked how many emails Jack received in the afternoon, we can set up an equation as follows: 3 + x = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, Jack received 7 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack received 3 emails and 64 messages yesterday evening. And he received 5 emails and 54 messages today. To find out how many emails Jack receives per day, we can divide the total number of emails he received today (5) by the number of days between yesterday and today (1). So, Jack receives 5 emails per day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 5 emails and 6 brief messages yesterday evening. Then he received 9 emails and 7 brief messages during the day. So, in total, Jack received 12 (5 + 6) emails and 13 (7 + 6) brief messages yesterday. Therefore, Jack receives approximately 1.08 emails and 1.14 brief messages per day (based on the number of emails and brief messages he received yesterday).
Response:  On Friday morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 messages. In the afternoon, he received 3 emails and 44 messages. So, the total number of emails Jack received that day is: 10 + 3 = 13 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 messages. Then he sent 2 emails and received 7 messages in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 messages in the morning, and then he received 2 + 7 = 9 additional messages in the afternoon. Therefore, the final number of messages that Jack received is 14 + 9 = 23 messages.
Response:  According to the information provided, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 8 emails. Therefore, he received an average of 0.8 emails per day (8/10).
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 emails in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 6 emails and sent 8 emails. So, we can calculate the number of emails Jack sent per day as follows:
Total emails sent = Number of emails received + Number of emails sent
= 4 + 2
= 6
Therefore, Jack sent 6 emails per day."
"Response:  If Jack received 9 emails per day and he received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then we can calculate how many emails he received in the afternoon as follows: Total number of emails = Number of emails in the morning + Number of emails in the afternoon Total number of emails = 7 + X Where X is the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon. Since we are given that Jack received ""nog 'n paar"" (a few) emails in the afternoon, let's assume that X is between 1 and 3, since ""paar"" means ""few"". So, the total number of emails Jack received that day is: Total number of emails = 7 + 2 or Total number of emails = 9. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails that day."
Response:  According to the information provided, Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 16 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 21 emails (5 + 16 = 21). Therefore, Jack had more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
"Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and another few in the evening, that means he received a total of 6 emails in the daytime (afternoon + evening). So, if we subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the total number of emails he received in the daytime, we get:

Total number of emails Jack received in the daytime = 6
Number of emails Jack received in the morning = 3

Therefore, Jack received 3 emails in the morning."
Response:  The distance that the pad jumped is equal to the difference between its height and the height of the sprinkler. So, if the sprinkler jumped 9 cm high, and the pad jumped 12 cm high, then we can calculate the distance traveled by the pad as follows: Distance = Height of Pad - Height of Sprinkler = 12 cm - 9 cm = 3 cm. Therefore, the pad jumped 3 cm higher than the sprinkler.
Response:  The sprinkler jumped 31 cm and the frog jumped 35 cm. So together they jumped 31 + 35 = 66 cm.
Response:  The sprinkler jumped 36 cm, and then the pad jumped 17 cm further than the sprinkler. So the distance traveled by the pad is equal to the distance between the sprinkler and the mouse plus the distance traveled by the mouse. Therefore, the distance traveled by the pad is 36 + 15 = 51 cm.
Response:  The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 25 cm, and the mouse has jumped 30 cm (since it was 18 cm further than the sprinkler). So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 30 - 18 = 12 cm.
Response:  The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 19 cm, and the mouse has traveled an additional 20 cm beyond the sprinkler. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the mouse is 19 + 20 = 39 cm.
Response:  The springboard has jumped 19 cm, and the pad has jumped 39 cm further than the springboard. So the distance traveled by the pad is equal to the distance between the springboard and the pad plus the distance traveled by the pad. Therefore, the distance traveled by the pad is 39 + 19 = 58 cm.
Response:  The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 25 cm, and the mouse has jumped further than the sprinkler by 32 cm. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 32 - 25 = 8 cm.
Response:  The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 24 cm and the mouse has jumped further than the sprinkler by 33 cm. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 33 + 24 = 57 cm. Therefore, the mouse has jumped 57 cm further than the sprinkler.
Response:  The distance traveled by the spring is equal to the initial displacement (13 cm) plus twice the amplitude (2 cm). So, the total distance traveled by the spring is: 13 + 2 = 15 cm. Therefore, the pad has traveled 15 cm.
Response:  The first sprinkler jumped 35 cm and then moved 4 cm further. So, in total, it jumped 41 cm (35 + 4).
Response:  The springboard had a jump of 19 inches (sprinkaan). Since the mouse and the pad were 44 inches away from the springboard when it jumped, the pad must have jumped 25 inches (44 - 19 = 25).
Response:  The mouse has jumped 12 inches further than the pad, so it has jumped 12 + 39 = 51 inches in total.
Response:  The distance traveled by the sprinkler is given as 21 inches and it has jumped 25 inches further than the mouse. So, the total distance traveled by the sprinkler is 21 + 25 = 46 inches. Therefore, the sprinkler has traveled 46 inches away from where the mouse was standing.
Response:  The panda has jumped 39 cm and the sprinker has jumped 17 cm. To find out how far the panda has jumped compared to the sprinker, we need to divide the distance the panda jumped by 2 (since there are two sprinkers). So, the panda has jumped 39 / 2 = 19.5 cm farther than the sprinker.
Response:  The spring distance of the spray is 9 inches and the mouse has jumped 3 inches less than the pad which has jumped 33 inches further than the spray. So, the distance the mouse has jumped = 33 - (3 - 9) = 24 inches.
Response:  The mouse has jumped 16 cm less than the pad, which means it has jumped 37 - 16 = 21 cm further than the spring. Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the spring is 21 cm.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and needs to add more. To find out how many cups of flour she should add, we can use the following formula:

Cups of flour needed = Cups of sugar - Cups of flour already added

In this case, the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Since Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, we need to subtract that amount from the total number of cups of flour required:

Cups of flour needed = 14 - 5 = 9 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour to the mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to her recipe, which means she has 5 cups of flour left (9 - 4 = 5). Now, we need to find out how much sugar is required for 5 cups of flour. According to the recipe, 1 cup of sugar is needed for every 2 cups of flour. So, for 5 cups of flour, Mary needs 2.5 cups of sugar (5 / 2 = 2.5). Since there are 11 cups of sugar in total, Mary needs an additional 8.5 cups of sugar (2.5 + 8.5 = 11). Therefore, Mary needs 8.5 more cups of sugar than flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already used 4 cups of flour and needs another 8 cups to make 6 cups of dough for 13 people. So we need to find out how much flour is needed per person. To do this, we divide the total amount of flour required (8 cups) by the number of people who will be eating the koeks (13). This gives us 0.615 cups of flour per person.
Response:  We know that Mary has already used 4 cups of flour and needs another 3 cups for the recipe. So, she still needs to use 5 cups of flour (3 - 4 = 5). Since there are 16 tablespoons in a cup, we can calculate how many tablespoons of flour Mary needs: 5 cups x 16 tablespoons/cup = 80 tablespoons.
Response:  The recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and a few more cups of flour. If Mary has already used three cups of flour, then she still needs to use 8 cups of flour (11 - 3 = 8). So, the recipe requires 8 cups of flour in total.
Response:  We know that Mary has already used 4 cups of flour and needs another 2 cups to make 12 cookies. So, she still needs 2 x 2 = 4 more cups of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour Mary had is 4 + 4 = 8 cups.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe for 9 cups of flour in total. So, we need to find out how many cups of flour are left to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:

Total amount of flour needed = 9 cups
Amount already added by Mary = 3 cups
So, the number of cups of flour remaining to be added = Total amount of flour needed - Amount already added = 9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar (out of 14) and 10 cups of flour (out of 5). So, to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

14 - 2 = 12

So, Mary still needs to add 12 cups of sugar."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour and needs to add more for the remaining 7 cups. So, she needs to add 7/11 = 0.636363636... cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 koppies (or 70%) of the flour to make the dough. So now she needs to add an additional amount equal to half of the remaining flour (which is 4 koppies or 40%). Therefore, Mary must add another 4 koppies (or 40%) of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to make 14 cups of sugar and 7 cups of water. Now she needs to add more flour than sugar and water. So we need to find out how much more flour is needed. To do this, we can use the following formula:

More flour = Total amount of flour - Amount of flour already used
= 12 cups - 2 cups
= 10 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 10 cups of flour to her mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to the recipe and now she needs to add more sugar than salt. The ratio between sugar and salt is 2:1, so for every cup of sugar she adds, she should add 3/4 cup of salt. Therefore, if she needs to add more sugar than salt, she will need to add (6 - 5) = 1 cup of sugar and (7 - 5) = 2 cups of salt. So, the final amount of sugar she will add is 1 + 2 = 3 cups, and the final amount of salt she will add is 2 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 spoons of sugar (so 13 - 2 = 11 spoons of sugar left to add). And we are asked for the total number of spoons of sugar needed for 12 people. So, the answer is 11 / 12 = 9 spoons of sugar.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to her recipe for 9 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add to balance the amount of sugar. To do this, we can divide the number of cups of sugar (6) by the number of cups of flour (9) and then multiply it by the difference between the two numbers (3):

(6 / 9) x 3 = 2

So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour to her recipe to balance the amount of sugar."
Response:  We know that there are 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour in total. Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so we have to add 7 cups of flour now (9 - 2 = 7). Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour more than she has added sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour and needs to add an additional amount of sugar. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups of flour from the total number of cups of sugar required (5 cups + 14 cups = 19 cups). So, Mary needs to add 9 cups of sugar more than the number of cups of flour she has already added (11 cups - 9 cups = 2 cups).
Response:  We know that Mary has already used 4 cups of flour (since she needs 3 cups for sugar and 10 cups for meat). So, if she still needs 5 cups of flour to make the koeks, then how many cups of flour does she have left after using 4 cups? The answer is 1 cup.
Response:  We know that Mary has already used up 4 cups of flour and needs another 12 cups to make 5 cups of sugar cookies. So, she still needs 8 cups of flour (12 - 4 = 8).
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 koppies (kopeks) of flour and 60 koppies (kopeks) of sugar to make the cake. To find out how many more koppies (kopeks) of flour she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of flour needed = Original amount of flour - Amount already added

In this case, the total amount of flour needed is:

Total amount of flour needed = 14 koppies (kopeks) - 7 koppies (kopeks) = 7 koppies (kopeks)

So, Mary needs to add 7 more koppies (kopeks) of flour to make the cake."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 coops of sugar and 12 coops of flour to her recipe for 11 coops of cookies. So, if she wants to make 9 coops of cookies, how many coops of sugar should she add? To find out, we need to subtract the number of coops of sugar she has already used (10) from the total number of coops of sugar needed for 9 coops of cookies (39). Therefore, Mary needs to add 29 coops of sugar to her recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour to her recipe and she needs 10 cups in total. So, we need to find out how much more flour she needs. To do this, we can subtract the amount she has already added (6) from the total amount needed (10): 10 - 6 = 4. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 4 cups of flour to her recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour (4/9 = 0.44) and she needs to add more flour so that the ratio of sugar to flour is equal to 3:2. So, we need to find out how much more flour Mary should add.

We can do this by using the formula:

Total amount of flour needed = Total amount of sugar / Ratio of sugar to flour

In this case, the total amount of sugar is 9 cups (9/9 = 1) and the ratio of sugar to flour is 3:2, which means that for every 3 cups of flour, there are 2 cups of sugar.

So, to find out how much more flour Mary should add, we can use the following calculation:

More flour needed = Total amount of sugar - Amount of flour already added / Ratio of sugar to flour
= 1 - 0.44 / 3:2
= 0.56

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 0.56 cups of flour to get the right ratio of sugar to flour."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to her recipe and she needs to add more flour than sugar. So, we can start with the total amount of flour needed: 9 cups (sugar) - 7 cups (flour) = 2 cups (more flour needed).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to her recipe, which means she has used up 12/11 = 1.09 cups of sugar so far. So, to find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount of sugar she has already used from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe: 6 - 1.09 = 4.91 cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 4.91 cups of sugar to her recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the dough and she needs to add more for 7 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to be added. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups already added (4) from the total amount needed (7):

7 - 4 = 3

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar to the dough."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 spoons of sugar and needs to add more flour than sugar. To find out how many spoons of flour she needs to add, we can use the ratio of sugar to flour in the recipe. According to the recipe, for every 3 spoons of sugar, there are 4 spoons of flour. So if Mary has already added 10 spoons of sugar, then she needs to add 3 x 10 = 30 spoons of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 14 - 10 = 4 spoons of flour.
"Response:  The text states that ""die winter is amper hier"" which means there are only few winter months in this area. Then it says ""en die meeste diere migreer na warmer lande"". This implies that most animals migrate to warmer lands during winter. Next, it mentions that there are 19 bird families living near the mountain. Finally, it asks how many more birds have flown away for the winter compared to those that returned afterward.
Given these details, we can estimate the number of birds that flew away for the winter as follows:
Let X be the total number of birds that lived near the mountain before winter arrived (i.e., before the migration). Since 60 birds have flown away, we can write:
X - 60 = Number of birds left behind after winter
Now, let Y be the total number of bird species that migrated to warmer lands during winter. From the passage, we know that there are 19 bird families that live near the mountain and some of them migrate to warmer lands during winter. So, Y = 19.
Now, we need to find out what percentage of the original population remained behind after winter. We can do this by dividing the number of birds left behind (X - 60) by the initial population size X:
Percentage of birds remaining = (X - 60)/X × 100%
Substituting the values, we get:
Percentage of birds remaining = (X - 60)/X × 100% = (200 - 60)/200 × 100% = 75%
Therefore, approximately 75% of the original population of birds remained behind after winter, while 25% migrated to warmer lands."
"Response:  The passage states that ""Die winter is amper hier"" which means that winter is scarce here. Then it says ""en die meeste diere migreer na warmer lande"". This implies that most animals migrate to warmer lands during winter. Next, it mentions that there are 87 bird families living near the mountain. Finally, it asks how many more bird families have moved away for the winter compared to those that have stayed behind. Based on these clues, we can infer that the number of bird families that have moved away for the winter is equal to the number of bird families that have stayed behind. Therefore, the answer is 0."
Response:  The total number of bird families that migrated away from the mountain is 20 (the number given in the question). Of these, 14 families remained behind at the mountain. So, the number of bird families that lived near the mountain at the beginning is 20 - 14 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 85 bird families living near the mountain. Of these, 23 birds migrated to Africa and 37 birds migrated to Asia. So, we need to find out how many bird species live nearby the mountain overall. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total number of bird species = Number of bird families x Number of individuals per family. In this case, we have: Total number of bird species = 85 bird families x? (number of individuals per family) Since we don't know the exact value of the number of individuals per family for each bird species, let's assume an average value of 4 individuals per family. Using this assumption, we get: Total number of bird species = 85 bird families x 4 individuals/family = 340 bird species Therefore, there are approximately 340 bird species living nearby the mountain.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain and 42 birds migrated from Africa and 31 birds migrated from Asia. To find out how many more birds migrated to Africa than those who migrated to Asia, we need to subtract the number of birds that migrated to Asia from the total number of birds that migrated. So, the answer is:
More birds migrated to Africa = Total number of birds that migrated to Africa - Number of birds that migrated to Asia
= 42 - 31
= 11"
"Response:  We know that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain and 47 birds migrated to Africa while 94 birds migrated to Asia. So, we need to find out how many more birds migrated to Asia than those who migrated to Africa. To do this, we can use the following formula:

More birds in Asia = Total number of birds in Asia - Total number of birds in Africa

Now let's plug in the values given in the question:
Total number of birds in Asia = 94
Total number of birds in Africa = 47

So, More birds in Asia = 94 - 47 = 47
Therefore, there are 47 more birds that migrated to Asia than those who migrated to Africa."
Response:  We know that most animals migrate to warmer lands during winter and there are 18 bird families living near the mountain. Out of these, 38 birds have flown to Africa and 80 birds have flown to Asia. So, we need to find out how many bird species flew for winter. Therefore, the answer is: 38 + 80 = 118 bird species flew for winter.
Response:  The text states that there are currently 87 bird families living near the mountain and that 18 new bird families have recently joined them. To find out how many bird families now live nearby the mountain, we can simply add these two numbers together: 87 + 18 = 105. Therefore, there are now 105 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 49 bird families live here during the summer and 59 of them migrate to warmer lands for the winter. This means that 10 bird families do not migrate (49 - 59 = 0). Therefore, there are 0 bird families near the mountain during the winter.
"Response:  We know that there are initially 41 bird families near the mountain and they migrate away for the winter to warmer lands. Now we want to find out how many bird families were nearby the mountain after the migration. So let's use the information given in the question: ""Die winter is amper hier en die meeste diere migreer na warmer lande."" This means that most of the birds migrated away from the area where the mountain is located. Therefore, the number of bird families nearby the mountain after the migration will be less than 41. Let's assume that only half of the original number of bird families returned to the area after the migration (i.e., 41/2 = 20.5). So, the answer is 20 bird families nearby the mountain after the migration."
Response:  We know that 86 bird families migrated away from here during the winter and 45 of them were near the mountain. So, if we subtract the number of birds that were near the mountain (45) from the total number of birds that migrated away (86), we get the remaining number of birds that migrated away but did not go near the mountain: 86 - 45 = 41. Therefore, there were 41 more bird families that migrated away than those that went near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that there are 41 bird families living near the mountain. Of these, 35 birds migrated to Asia and 62 birds migrated to Africa. So, we can calculate the ratio of birds that migrated to Africa to those who migrated to Asia as follows:
Ratio = Number of birds that migrated to Africa / Number of birds that migrated to Asia
= 62 / 35
= 1.80
Therefore, more than one and a half times as many birds migrate to Africa as migrate to Asia."
Response:  We know that 3 bird families live near the mountain during winter and 26 new bird families have migrated to the area from the Arctic region nearby the mountain while 2 bird families flew further south for the winter. So, we can calculate the total number of bird families living near the mountain as follows: Total = Number of existing families + Number of newly arrived families - Number of families that fled further south = 3 + 26 - 2 = 27 bird families are living near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 253 colorful pencils as a gift for his birthday and lost or misplaced 70 of them by the end of the school year. So, how many pencils did he have at the end of the school year?

Let X be the number of colorful pencils Paul had at the end of the school year. Since he lost or misplaced 70 pencils, we can write an equation based on this information:
X - 70 = 183 (since he had 253 initially)
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 183 + 70 = 253
So, Paul had 253 colorful pencils at the end of the school year!"
"Response:  We know that Paul has lost or been given away 551 books during his school year and he only had 177 overheard. So, if we calculate how many books he could have gotten for his birthday, it would be:

Number of books Paul received = Total number of books - Number heard
= 551 - 177
= 374

Therefore, Paul received 374 books for his birthday."
Response:  If Paul had 440 colored pencils and gave away 111 to his friends, then he must have lost 329 (440 - 111). So, he has 329 colored pencils left.
"Response:  If Paul had 65 colored pencils and gave away 213 to his friends during the school year while losing 16, then we can calculate how many he has left as follows:

Total number of colored pencils = 65 (initial) + 213 (given away) - 16 (lost or given away)
= 84 (remaining)

Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 16 colored pencils during the school year."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul gave away 589 colored pencils for his birthday and lost 161 of them during the school year. So, he has 428 colored pencils left (589 - 161 = 428). Now we need to find out how many more colored pencils he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number he lost from the total number he had: 428 - 161 = 267. Therefore, Paul gave away 267 more colored pencils than he lost.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul received 110 colorful pots for his birthday and gave away 90 of them during the school year. This means he had 110 - 90 = 20 more pots than he gave away. So, he lost 412 - 20 = 392 pots. Therefore, Paul lost 392 pots more than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul had 563 potatoes in total and gave away 558 of them as gifts to his friends during the school year. So he has 5 remaining potatoes. Now we need to find out how many crystals he got for his birthday. According to the question, he received 332 crystals over the 563 potatoes he had initially. Therefore, the number of crystals he got for his birthday is 332 / 5 = 66.4 (round down to 66).
Response:  We know that Paul had 52 potatoes in his box and gave away 535 to his friends. So, he lost or gave away a total of 587 potatoes (535 - 52 = 587). Therefore, there are 587 potatoes missing or given away.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 gifts and had 66 outings for his birthday at the end of the school year. This means he had a total of 587 experiences (521 + 66). However, we are told that he lost some experiences due to absences or other reasons. So, let's subtract the number of losses from the total number of experiences: 587 - 154 = 433 experiences left. Therefore, Paul lost 154 experiences during the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul had 531 colored pencils and lost 38 during the school year. So he has 493 left. Now we need to find out how many more coloring pages than drawing pages he had. He had 391 overages in coloring pages, so if he didn't lose any of those, he would have 391 + 493 = 884 total pages. Therefore, he gained 884 - 391 = 503 more coloring pages than drawing pages.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 601 crystals at the beginning of the year and lost some during the school year. He ended up with 406 crystals. To find out how many more he lost than gained, we need to subtract the number he gained from the number he lost:

Number lost = Number started - Number gained
= 601 - 336
= 265

So, Paul lost 265 crystals during the school year."
Response:  If Paul had 291 points at the end of the school year and he lost or misplaced 164 points (315 - 291 = 164), then he has 127 points left (291 - 164 = 127). Therefore, Paul has 127 points for his birthday gift.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul had 267 colorful pots in his box and lost 231 of them during school year. This means he has 36 pots left (267 - 231 = 36). Now, we are asked how many more colored pots he gave away than what he lost. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of pots he lost from the total number of pots he gave away. So, the difference is: 308 (number of pots given away) - 231 (number of pots lost) = 77. Therefore, Paul gave away 77 more colored pots than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul had 457 books and lost 120 book covers. So he has 337 book covers left. Now we are told that for every book cover he lost, he gained 320 colorful potatoes. Therefore, the total number of colorful potatoes he gained is equal to the number of book covers he lost, which is 120. So Paul gained 120 x 320 = 39,600 colorful potatoes.
Response:  The number of clients Kelner had at first was 11, and after some time, he still had 3 clients left. So, the difference between the total number of clients he had (11) and the number of clients he still had (3) is equal to the original number of clients he had minus the number of clients he still has now: 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, Kelner had 8 more clients than what he currently has.
"Response: 
Kelner had 3 clients at first and then lost some of them. After that, he gained 4 new clients. So, the total number of clients Kelner has now is:
3 + (4 - x) = 3 + 4 - x
Where x is the number of clients Kelner lost.
So, the answer is: 7 more clients than what Kelner had when he started."
Response:  At first, Kelner had some clients (let's call it x). After 9 of his clients left, he still had 12 clients (x - 9 = 12). So, at the beginning, Kelner had x clients.
Response:  Kelner had 14 clients initially and then he lost 5 of them. So, he has 9 remaining clients (14 - 5 = 9).
"Response: 
Nick had 13 clients initially and then gained 4 new clients after some of them left. So, he currently has 13 + 4 = 17 clients. Therefore, Nick had 17 clients in total."
"Response: 
Kelner had 12 clients initially and lost 5 of them. So he has 7 remaining clients (12 - 5 = 7).
Now, he gained 14 new clients. Therefore, his current number of clients is equal to the sum of his initial clients and the new ones: 7 + 14 = 21.
So, Kelner currently has 21 clients."
Response:  The first client arrived after Kelner had already had 3 clients. Then, another 2 clients arrived and Kelner had 8 clients in total. So, the number of new clients that arrived is 8 - 3 = 5.
"Response: 
Nick had 8 clients initially and then lost some of them. After that, he gained 5 new clients. Now, he has 99 new clients. So, to find out how many total clients Nick has now, we need to add up all these numbers:
Total number of clients = Initial clients + New clients - Lost clients
= 8 + 5 -?
= 8 + 5 - 8 (since 8 were lost)
= 15
Therefore, Nick currently has 15 clients in total."
"Response: 
Nick had 12 clients at first and then he lost some of them. After that, he gained 14 new clients. Now he has 10 new clients. So, in total, Nick has 10 + 14 = 24 clients now."
Response:  At first, he bought a chocolate bar for $ 2. Then, he spent another $ 3 on something else. So, initially, he had $ 2 + $ 3 = $ 5.
Response:  If he had $ 4 and spent $ 3 on chocolate, then he has $ 1 left. So, he spent $ 3 / 4 = $ 0.75 on the chocolate. Therefore, he spent $ 0.75 on the chocolate.
"Response:  If he bought 99 chocolates for $3 each, then...

$3 x 99 = $297
So, there is $297 worth of money spent on buying those chocolates."
Response:  If Dan bought 2 chocolates for $4 each, then he paid a total of $8 for both chocolates. So, if we divide the total amount he paid by the number of chocolates he bought, we get the cost per chocolate: $8 / 2 = $4 per chocolate. Therefore, each chocolate costs $4.
Response:  If he bought 2 pairs of chocolate bars for $6, and each pair costs $3, then... (1) He has spent $6 / 2 = $3 per pair. (2) Therefore, he has bought x pairs of chocolate bars, where x = $3 / $3 = 1. So, he has bought one pair of chocolate bars. (3) Hence, he has bought 2 x = 2 chocolate bars in total.
Response:  Dan bought something for $ 7. He spent $ 2 on an item and $ 3 on another item. So he spent a total of $ 5. Therefore, there is $ 2 left over after buying these items.
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar is $ 7 and the cost of one piece of candy is $ 6. So if he bought both, he spent a total of $ 7 + $ 6 = $ 13. Therefore, he spent $ 13 to buy the chocolate and candy.
Response:  If he spent $ 2 for chocolate and $ 6 for toy, then he has $ 6 - $ 2 = $ 4 left after buying the chocolate. So, he will spend $ 4 to buy the toy. Therefore, he will have $ 4 + $ 2 = $ 6 left after buying both items.
Response:  If he spent $ 5 for the chocolate bar and $ 2 for the candy, then he has $ 5 - $ 2 = $ 3 left to spend on chocolate. So, if he wants to buy a chocolate bar that costs $ 3, he will have enough money to do so. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on chocolate is $ 3.
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar was $ 4 and Dan bought two for $ 8. So, he spent a total of $ 12 ( $ 4 x 2). Then his friend gave him $ 5 as change, so in total, Dan received $ 7 ( $ 5 - $ 12).
Response:  If Dan had spent $3 on the chocolate bar and then got $4 at the beginning, that means he has $7 left after buying the chocolate bar. So, the snack jockey cost him $7 / 2 = $3.50.
Response:  If Dan bought 4 chocolate bars for R3 each, he spent R12 in total (R3 x 4). Now, if he also bought an ice cream cone for R5, his total spending was R17 (R12 + R5). So, there is R17 owed to him.
Response:  If Dan spent $3 on two chocolate bars that cost the same amount, then each bar must have cost half of that amount. So, if one bar costs $3/2 = $1.50, then each bar costs $1.50.
Response:  If he spent $ 5 for chocolate and $ 3 for candy, then he has spent in total $ 8 (5 + 3). So, to buy something nice with the money he spent on chocolate, he will have $ 8 - $ 5 = $ 3 left over.
Response:  If he spent $ 4 for chocolate and $ 7 for candy, then he spent a total of $ 11. So, if he bought chocolate worth $ 7, then he spent $ 7 / 2 = $ 3.50 on chocolate. Therefore, he spent $ 11 + $ 3.50 = $ 14.50 to buy both chocolate and candy together.
Response:  If Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them, then he has 37 remaining books at home (115 - 78 = 37).
Response:  If Paul had $137 in his book collection before he sold it and he got $105 for each of them, then... (1) The total number of books he had = Total amount of money he received / Price per book. So, (2) Number of books he had = $105 x 137 = 14,050 books. Therefore, Paul had 14,050 books at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and sold some of them to his friend who gave him 35 books back. So, after selling some books, he had 73 books left (108 - 35 = 73). Now, we are asked how many books he had in the garage when he sold them. Therefore, the number of books he had in the garage is equal to the total number of books he had minus the number of books he gave to his friend, which is 73 - 35 = 38 books.
Response:  If Paul had 50 books before he bought a motorhome and after buying it, he had 151 ears, then we can say that he bought x number of books. Since he had 50 books initially, we can write an equation as follows: 50 + x = 151. Solving for x, we get x = 101. So, Paul bought 101 books after buying the motorhome.
"Response:  According to the question, Paul had two books initially and sold them for $20 each. So he earned $40 from selling those two books. Then, after buying 150 new books at $10 each, he spent $150. Therefore, his current number of books is:

$40 (initial books) + $150 (new books) = $190

So, Paul has 190 books now."
"Response:  According to the question, Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a car sale. After selling those, he bought 42 new ones. Now, if he has 15 books left, that means he sold more books than what he bought. So, the difference between the number of books he sold (let's call it x) and the number of books he bought is equal to the total number of books he had initially minus the number of books he still has now. Therefore, we can write an equation:
x = 21 - 15 = 6
So, Paul sold 6 more books than what he bought."
Response:  If Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them through his motorhome sales, he must have had fewer books left after selling those. Then, if he bought 38 new books, he now has 116 books in total (71 + 38 = 116). So, to find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he now has: 116 - 38 = 78. Therefore, Paul bought 78 more books than he sold.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So, we can calculate how many books he sold at the garage sale as follows: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Remaining number of books = 108 - 66 = 42 books. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  According to the question, Paul had 51 books and 106 pens before he sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling those items, he had 82 books and 14 pens left over. So, initially, Paul had 106 pens (not including the ones he sold). Since he only sold 14 pens, that means he still has 92 pens left. Therefore, the number of pens Paul had in the garage sale is 92.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul had initially 136 books and later sold some of them. The number of books he sold is equal to the difference between the initial number of books and the final number of books he had. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Initial number of books = 136
Final number of books =? (as given in the problem)

We know that the final number of books is 27, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

Initial number of books - Final number of books =?
= 136 - 27
= 109

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books."
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave away 39 of them as gifts. So he was left with 95 books. Then, he sold some books at a garage sale and earned $20 for each book sold. Since he sold half of his remaining books (which is equal to 95 / 2 = 47.5), he earned $20 x 47.5 = $950 from the garage sale. Therefore, he has $950 - $20 x 39 = $680 left after the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 pens and 153 books. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

Number of books sold = 13
Number of pens sold = 23
Total number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold
Total number of pens = Initial number of pens - Number of pens sold
Now, let's solve for the number of books sold at the garage sale:

Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left with Paul
= 153 - 13
= 140
So, Paul sold 140 books at the garage sale."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul had initially 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. So, the number of pens he sold at the garage sale is equal to the difference between his initial amount of pens (42) and the number of pens he had left after the sale (19). Therefore, the number of pens he sold at the garage sale is 42 - 19 = 23.
Response:  There were initially ten roses in the vase and Jessica took eight more from her garden and put them in the vase. So, there are now... (10 + 8) = 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 roses from Jessica's garden placed in the vase and then another 7 roses (2 x 3) were added to it later. So, the total number of roses in the vase at any given time can be calculated as follows: Total no. of roses = Initial no. of roses + Additional nos. of roses. In this case, the initial no. of roses was 16, and the additional no. of roses was 7, so the total no. of roses in the vase at any given time would be: Total no. of roses = 16 + 7 = 23. Therefore, there were 23 roses in the vase at the beginning.
"Response: 
Jessica took 4 roses out of the vase and added some new ones from her garden to fill it up. So, there are now 23 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses she planted, we need to subtract the number of roses she took out (4) from the total number of roses in the vase (23). Therefore, Jessica planted 19 roses."
Response:  Jessica took out 33 roses from the vase and added some new ones from her garden to replace them. So, there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she planted than what she removed, we need to subtract the number of roses she took out (33) from the total number of roses in the vase after adding the new ones (17). Therefore, the answer is 16 more roses planted than taken away.
"Response: 
Jessica took 34 roses out of the vase and added some new ones from her garden to fill it up again. So there are now 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she took out than what she brought in, we need to subtract the number of roses she brought in (15) from the number of roses she took out (34):

Number of roses taken out - Number of roses brought in = 34 - 15 = 19
So, Jessica took out 19 more roses than what she brought in."
Response:  We know that Jessica had 59 roses and she gave some away to her friends. Now there are 20 roses in the vase. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica has left as follows: Number of roses Jessica has = Total number of roses - Number of roses given away = 59 - x (where x is the number of roses given away) = 59 - 20 = 39 roses. Therefore, Jessica has 39 roses left after giving some away.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica added more from her garden, making it 21 roses in total. So, if we subtract the initial number of roses (13) from the total number of roses (21), we get: 21 - 13 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 roses in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica added more roses from her garden (she planted 3 more). So now we have 18 roses (15 + 3) in total. And still, she has to add some orchids from her garden too (she planted 4 more). Now we have 96 orchids in total (62 + 4). Therefore, Jessica planted 3 more roses and 4 more orchids. The answer is 3 + 4 = 7 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica added more roses from her garden. So, after she added those new roses, there are now 10 roses in the vase. Now, we need to find out how many orchids Jessica planted. According to the problem statement, there are now 21 orchids in the vase. Therefore, Jessica must have planted 19 orchids (21 - 10 = 19).
Response:  There were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica added more roses from her garden. So there are now 12 roses in the vase. However, we know that there are still only 2 orchids in the vase because Jessica did not add any new orchids. Therefore, there are currently 12 - 2 = 10 more roses than orchids in the vase.
Response:  There were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica added more roses from her garden. So there are now 11 roses in the vase. If we subtract the number of roses that Jessica added (7) from the total number of flowers in the vase, we get 4 (11 - 7). Therefore, there are 4 more orchids than roses in the vase.
Response:  At first, there were three roses in the vase (Jessica had put two roses from her garden into the vase). Then, she added another nine roses to the vase (she picked more roses from her garden and put them in the vase). So, initially, there were three roses in the vase, and then Jessica added an additional nine roses, for a total of 12 roses in the vase now.
Response:  There were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica added more roses from her garden. So, there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica planted, we can subtract the number of roses she already had (13) from the total number of roses now in the vase (14). Therefore, Jessica planted 7 roses (14 - 13 = 7).
Response:  There were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica added more roses from her garden. So there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. To find out how many orchids Jessica planted, we can subtract the number of orchids she already had (3) from the total number of plants in the vase after she added more (7). Therefore, Jessica planted 4 orchids.
Response:  There were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica added more roses from her garden. So there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase, we can subtract the number of orchids from the total number of flowers: 22 - 20 = 2 more roses than orchids. Therefore, there are 2 more roses than orchides in the vase.
Response:  There were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica added more roses from her garden. So there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. Therefore, there are 6 more orchids than roses in the vase.
Response:  The original length of Robin's hair was 17 cm (duim). If she cut off 2 cm from it, then her new length would be 15 cm (duim). So, if we subtract 2 cm from 17 cm, we get 15 cm as the remaining length of her hair after cutting off 2 cm. Therefore, Robin has 15 cm of hair left now.
Response:  Before Robin cut her hair, it was 20 cm long (as stated in the question). After she cut it off, it became 10 cm long. So, before she cut it, her hair was 20 + 10 = 30 cm long.
Response:  Firstly, Robin had 16 duim (centimeters) long hair and then she cut it off by 11 duim. So now her hair length is 5 duim less than before which means it is 11 duim (centimeters) long. Now, if we add 12 duim to this length, her hair will grow by that amount and become 23 duim (centimeters) long.
Response:  If Robin's hair grew by 18 duim (or 4.5 cm) more than it was before, and her hair was originally 19 duim (or 4.5 cm) long, then its new length would be: New length = Original length + Growth = 19 duim + 18 duim = 37 duim (or 9.5 cm). So, Robin's hair is now 37 duim (or 9.5 cm) long.
Response:  If Robin had 13 cm of her hair cut off and initially it was 14 cm long, then now her hair is 14 - 13 = 1 cm longer than before. So, her hair is now 15 cm long.
Response:  The length of Robin's hair was initially 14 cm (duim). It grew by 8 duim to become 22 cm (duim) when it reached its full growth potential. Then, Robin cut her hair off, which reduced its length by 20 duim. So now, Robin's hair is 4 cm (duim) long.
Response:  If Danny had 12 bottle doppers in his collection and he found 53 more in the park, then he now has a total of 65 bottle doppers (12 + 53).
Response:  If Danny had 21 bottle doppies in his collection and he found additional 53 bottle doppies in the park, then the total number of bottle doppies that Danny has is equal to the initial amount plus the new findings. So, the answer is 74 bottle doppies (21 + 53).
Response:  We know that Danny had more than 33 bottle doops at first because he found 63 in the park and threw away 51. So, initially, Danny had 63 - 51 = 12 bottle doops.
Response:  If Danny found 36 bottle doops in the park and he took away 35 of them, then there are 1 more bottle doop left than what he took away. So, the number of bottle doops that Danny found is equal to 36 - 35 = 1. Therefore, Danny has 1 more bottle doop than what he took away.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 30 bottle doops in the park and he has 42 bottle doops in his collection now. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of bottles he found and the number of bottles he collected as follows:

Number of bottles Danny found - Number of bottles Danny collected = 30 - 42 = -12

Therefore, Danny went to collect more bottle doops than he found in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 22 bottle doppies and 8 packaging initially. Then he found 28 more bottle doppies and 63 more packaging. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Total initial bottles = 22 + 8 = 30
New total bottles = 30 + 28 = 58
So, Danny had 58 bottle doppies initially."
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 bottle doppies and 30 packaging in the park. Then he found 17 more bottle doppies and collected 57 additional packaging. So initially, Danny had 22 + 17 = 39 bottle doppies and 30 + 57 = 87 packaging. Therefore, Danny initially had 39 x 4 = 156 bottle doppies and 87 x 5 = 435 packaging.
"Response:  We know that Danny had 30 bottle dooppies and 14 packaging in the park he found. Now he has 7 bottle dooppies and 86 packaging in his collection. So we can calculate the difference between what he had in the park and what he collected like this: 
Difference = (30 - 7) + (14 - 86) = 23 + (-70) = -47
So Danny found more packaging than bottles in the park."
"Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 11 bottle doppies and 28 packaging in the park. Then he found 68 bottle doppies and 51 packaging. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

Initially, Danny had x bottle doppies and y packaging.
After finding more items, Danny now has 68 bottle doppies and 51 packaging.
We are asked how many more packaging than bottle doppies Danny found. To find out, we need to subtract the number of bottle doppies from the total number of packaging:

Number of packaging = Total number of packaging - Number of bottle doppies
= 51 - 11
= 40
Therefore, Danny found 40 more packaging than bottle doppies in the park."
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 71 bottle doppies and 24 packaging in the park. Then he found 28 more bottle doppies and 16 more packaging. So, now he has 28 + 28 = 56 bottle doppies and 16 + 16 = 32 packaging. Therefore, there are 56 - 24 = 32 more bottle doppies than packaging with Danny currently.
"Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 bottle doppies and 62 packaging items in the park. Now he has 27 bottle doppies and 43 packaging items in his collection. So, we can calculate the difference between these two amounts to find out how many more packaging items than bottle doppies Danny now has:

Difference = Number of packaging items now - Number of packaging items initially
= 43 - 62
= -19

So, there are 19 fewer packaging items than bottle doppies in Danny's current collection compared to when he first found them in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 bottle doops in the park and then found 25 of them. So, if he had x bottle doops initially, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 66 = 25
Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations.
x = 92
Therefore, Danny had 92 bottle doops initially."
Response:  If Danny had 25 bottle doppies earlier and found 16 more later, then he has now 41 bottle doppies (25 + 16). So, the number of bottle doppies that Danny found in the park is 41.
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 58 bottle doppies and he found 60 more in the park. So, his total number of bottle doppies at first was 58 + 60 = 118. Now, we are told that he has 67 bottle doppies in his collection now. Therefore, to find out how many bottle doppies Danny initially had, we can subtract the number of bottle doppies he already had from the current number of bottle doppies he has: 118 - 67 = 51. So, Danny initially had 51 bottle doppies.
"Response:  We know that Danny had 6 old bottle caps before he found 50 new ones in the park. Now he has 60 bottle caps altogether. So, we can calculate how many more bottle caps Danny found in the park than what he threw away like this:

Number of bottle caps Danny found in the park = Total number of bottle caps Danny has now - Number of bottle caps Danny threw away
= 60 - 6
= 54
Therefore, Danny found 54 more bottle caps in the park than what he threw away."
Response:  We know that Danny had 54 bottle dooppies at first and he found 48 new ones in the park. So now he has 52 bottle dooppies in his collection. To find out how many more bottle dooppies Danny went through than what he found in the park, we need to subtract the number of bottle dooppies he found from the total number of bottle dooppies he initially had: 52 - 48 = 4. Therefore, Danny went through 4 more bottle dooppies than what he found in the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 82 packaging and found 29 bottle tops in the park. So he started with 82 - 29 = 53 packagings left. Then, he found 42 more bottle tops and collected them. Therefore, he now has 53 + 42 = 95 packagings in total. Finally, we are told that he has 61 bottle tops in his collection, so he must have lost some during the process. Thus, the initial number of bottle tops Danny had is 95 - 61 = 34 bottle tops.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 66 packaging and found 39 bottle tops in the park. So he gained 39 - 66 = -27 packagings. Now he has 16 bottle tops and 68 packages, so he lost 68 - 16 = 52 packages. Therefore, Danny initially had 52 packagings.
"Response:  We know that Danny had 46 packs and 50 bottle doppies in the park initially. Then he found 21 bottle doppies and 52 packages thereafter. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: 

Initially, Danny had x bottle doppies + y packs = 46... (i)
After finding more bottles, Danny had x bottle doppies + y packs = 21 + 52 = 73... (ii)
Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Using equation (ii), we get:

x = 73 - 21 = 52
So, Danny found 52 more bottle doppies than packages after searching the park again."
Response:  We know that Danny had 65 packs and found 5 bottle dopes and 31 bottles in the park. Now he has 31 bottle dopes and 9 bottle verpackings in his collection. So we can calculate how many more packs than bottle dopes Danny found in the park using the following formula: Number of packs - number of bottle dopes = difference between the two numbers. Substituting the values given in the problem into this formula gives us: 65 - 5 = 60. Therefore, Danny found 60 more packs than bottle dopes in the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 58 bottle doppies and 25 packaging items in the park. Now he has 11 packages and 12 bottle doppies in his collection. So, we need to find out how many more bottles than packages Danny now has. To do this, we can subtract the number of packages from the total number of bottles: 58 - 11 = 47. Therefore, Danny now has 47 more bottles than packages.
"Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 15 bottle doppies and 18 packaging pieces in the park. Now he has 67 packages and 35 bottle doppies in his collection. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

Initially, Danny had x bottle doppies and y package pieces.
Now, Danny has 67 packages and z bottle doppies, where z = x + y.
We are given that x + y = 15 (the initial number of bottle doppies) and z = 35 (the current number of bottle doppies). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 12 (the initial number of bottle doppies) and y = 3 (the initial number of package pieces). Therefore, Danny now has 45 more package pieces than he originally had (3 - 12 = -9). So, the difference between the number of package pieces and bottle doppies is 45."
Response:  We know that Jake had 11 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake had 17 pears, then Steven had 17 + 11 = 28 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer penguins than Steven. Steven has 14 more penguins than Jill. So, if Jill has x penguins, then Steven has x + 14 penguins. Now we are told that Steven has 15 penguins in total. Therefore, Jake must have x - 15 penguins. Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, Jake has 9 penguins.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer cats than Steven. So, if Jake has x cats, then Steven has x + 13 cats. Therefore, Jill has x - 13 cats. Since Jill has fewer cats than Steven, she must have at least 1 cat less than him. So, Jill has 18 cats.
Response:  We know that Jake has three fewer penguins than Steven. So if Steven has 8 more penguins than Jill, then Jake has 8 - 3 = 5 more penguins than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 5 more penguins than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer pets than Steven. So if Steven has x pets, then Jake has x - 12 pets. Also, we know that Jill has 11 more pets than Jake. Therefore, Jill has (x - 12) + 11 = x + 9 pets. Solving for x, we get x = 30. So Jill has 30 more pets than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer penguins than Steven (7 less). So, Jake has 9 + 7 = 16 penguins. Therefore, Jake has 16 penguins.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer penguins than Steven and 8 more penguins than Jill. So, if Steven had x penguins, then Jake would have x - 7 = 10 penguins. And if Jill had y penguins, then Jake would have y + 8 = 18 penguins. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

x - 7 = 10... (1)
y + 8 = 18... (2)
Now we need to solve for y, which is the number of penguins Jill has. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

9 = y
So Jill has 9 penguins."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer cats than Steven and more cats than Jill. So, we can start with Jake's number of cats: 9. Now, let's compare it to Steven's number of cats: 16 - 9 = 7. And now, let's compare it to Jill's number of cats: 18 - 16 = 2. Therefore, Steven has 7 more cats than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has 6 fewer penguins than Jake. So, if Jake has x penguins, then Steven has x - 6 penguins. Since Jill has 5 more penguins than Steven, we can say that Jill has (x - 6) + 5 = x penguins. Therefore, Jake has 34 penguins.
Response:  We know that Jill has 87 penguins and Steven has 18 more than Jill. So, if we subtract 18 from 87, we get 69. Therefore, Jake has 5 fewer penguins than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 fewer penguins than Steven and Steven has 15 more penguins than Jill. So, if we subtract 16 from 31 (Steven's number of penguins), we get 15 (Jill's number of penguins). Now, if we add 12 to Jill's number of penguins, we get 27 (Jill's new number of penguins). Therefore, Jill has 27 more penguins than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven and 79 more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from the number of pears Steven had (19), we get the number of pears Jake had (8). Similarly, if we add 79 to the number of apples Steven had (14), we get the number of apples Jake had (93). Therefore, Jake had 8 pears and 93 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven and 3 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven had 9 pears and 8 apples, then Jake must have 9 - 13 = 4 less pears and 3 + 8 = 11 more apples than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 4 pears and 11 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract 6 from the number of pears Steven had (17), we get the number of pears Jake had (11). And if we add 8 to the number of apples Steven had (16), we get the number of apples Jake had (24). Therefore, the difference between the number of pears and apples that Steven had is 13 (11 - 16 = 13).
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pears than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract 3 from the number of pears Steven has (12), we get the number of pears Jake has (9). Now, let's find out how many more apples Jake has than Steven. If Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, then the difference between their numbers of apples is 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 cats and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, if we subtract the number of cats Jill has (which is 4) from the number of cats Jake has, we will get the number of cats Jake has. Therefore, Jake has 8 cats.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 penguins and Jake has 12 fewer than Steven, which means Jake has 6 penguins less than Steven. So, if Steven has 18 penguins, then Jake has 18 - 6 = 12 penguins. Therefore, Jill has 12 penguins.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 puppies and Jake has fewer than 19 puppies. So, Jake must have 19 - x = 19 - 12 = 7 puppies. Therefore, Jake has 7 puppies.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 cats and Jake has 6 fewer cats than Steven. So, if Steven has x cats, then Jake has x - 6 = 8 cats. Therefore, Jill has 3 more cats than Jake, so she has 8 + 3 = 11 cats.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Steven had x pears, then Jake would have 84 + 10 = 94 pears. Therefore, Jake has 94 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake had more apples than Steven. So, if Jake had x apples, then Steven had x - 17 = 9 apples. Now we know that Jake gave 13 more apples to Steven, so Jake had x + 13 = 2x apples left after giving them to Steven. Therefore, Jake had 2x apples in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more pears than Steven. So, we can start with Jake's information to find out how many more pears he has than apples. According to Jake, he has 8 fewer apples than Steven, which means he has 3 (8 - 5 = 3) fewer apples than Steven. Now, let's check Steven's information to see how many more pears he has than apples. According to Steven, he has 10 more pears than apples. Therefore, if Steven has x apples, then he has x + 10 pears. Since Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven, Jake has 3 + 10 = 13 more pears than apples. So, the difference between the number of pears and apples is 13.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pears and 4 more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract 3 from the number of pears Steven had (19), we get 16. And if we add 4 to the number of apples Steven had (15), we get 19. Therefore, Steven has 3 more apples than Jake.
Response:  If there were $78 in Olivia's purse and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then how much money does she have left? So, the answer is $63 ($78 - $15).
"Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $33 initially, then we can calculate how much money she had initially as follows:

$33 (initial amount) - $78 (amount spent at supermarket) = $-45

So, Olivia had $45 initially."
"Response: 
Olivia had $100 in her purse and spent $148 on various things. After visiting the supermarket, she found an additional $159. So, how much did she spend in total?
Total amount spent = $148 + $159 = $297
Therefore, Olivia spent $297."
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her piggy bank initially. She spent $49 at the store. So, she has $49 - $3 = $46 left.
Therefore, Olivia collected more money than what she spent at the store."
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her piggy bank and spent $91 on various things. After visiting the supermarket, she had $14 left over. So, if we subtract what she spent at the supermarket from what she had originally, we get:
$53 - $14 = $39
Therefore, Olivia went to the supermarket with $39 more than what she initially had."
Response:  If there were initially $106 in Olivia's purse and she spent $26 at the store, then there are now $70 left ($106 - $26 = $70). When she spent $49 at the display, she had $70 left, so she spent $49 / $70 = $0.70 at the display.
Response:  After Olivia visited the supermarket and spent $29 there, she had $54 left in her wallet initially. So, the amount she spent = $29.
Response:  If Olivia had $128 initially and spent $38 at the supermarket, then she has $90 left: $128 - $38 = $90.
Response:  Dave had 19 programs on his phone and he deleted 5 of them. So, there are 14 programs left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had n programs on his phone and he deleted 18 of them, then he had 18 - 18 = 0 programs left on his phone. So, he had no programs on his phone after deleting 18. Now, if he had 5 overheard, that means he had 5 new programs on his phone after deleting the old ones. Therefore, the number of programs he had at the beginning is 5.
"Response: 
Dave had 10 programs on his phone at first. He added 11 new programs after that. After he deleted some of them, he still had 4 left. So, the number of programs Dave removed is 6 (10 - 11 + 4 = 6)."
Response:  Dave had 21 programs initially and then added 89 new ones after deleting some. So, he gained 68 more programs than what he deleted (89 - 21 = 68).
Response:  According to the question, Dave had 15 programs on his phone at first and then added 71 new ones after deleting some. So, he had 86 programs (15 + 71 - 3) on his phone in total.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 apps and 77 layers on his phone before he deleted some programs and layers. After deleting those programs and layers, he had 5 programs and 23 layers left. To find out how many apps he deleted, we can subtract the number of apps he had after deleting programs and layers from the total number of apps he had initially. So, the answer is: Number of apps deleted = Initial number of apps - Number of apps after deleting programs and layers = 16 - (5 + 23) = 16 - 28 = -12 apps.
Response:  If Dave had 17 apps and 21 layers on his phone before he deleted some programs and layers, then after deleting those programs and layers, he had 3 programs and 7 layers left. So, to find out how many layers he removed, we can subtract the number of layers he had after deleting programs from the total number of layers he had before deleting programs: 7 - 21 = -14. Therefore, Dave removed 14 layers from his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 programs and 24 layers on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some programs and layers, he had 21 programs and 4 layers left. So, we can calculate how many more programs than layers Dave had on his phone like this: Number of programs - Number of layers = More programs than layers. In this case, the difference between the number of programs and layers is 6 (21 - 4). Therefore, Dave had 6 more programs than layers on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 layers on his phone before he deleted some programs and layers. After deleting those programs and layers, he had 6 programs and 15 layers left. To find out how many more layers than programs Dave had on his phone, we need to subtract the number of programs from the total number of layers. So, the answer is: Number of more layers = Total layers - Programs = 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, Dave had 9 more layers than programs on his phone.
Response:  According to the question, Dave had 17 programs on his phone before he added some more. After adding a few more, he had 18 ears. So, Dave has added 3 programs (from 17 to 20) to his phone. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Dave had 59 likes and 15 programs on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some programs and likes, he had 12 programs and 30 likes. To find out how many programs he deleted, we can subtract the number of programs he had after deleting from the number of programs he had before deleting: 59 - 12 = 47 programs were deleted.
Response:  If Dave had 24 layers and removed some of them, he must have had 13 programs left. After removing more programs and layers, he had 17 programs and 21 layers remaining. So, to find out how many layers he removed, we can subtract the number of layers he had after removing programs from the total number of layers he had initially: 21 - 17 = 4. Therefore, Dave removed 4 layers.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 apps and 9 layers on his phone before he deleted some programs and layers. After deleting some programs and layers, he had 5 layers and 12 programs on his phone. So, we can calculate the number of apps he had initially by subtracting the number of layers from the total number of apps: 24 - 9 = 15. Therefore, Dave had 15 more apps than layers on his phone initially.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 11 programs and 3 layers on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 24 layers and 2 programs left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

Number of layers = 11 + (3 x Number of programs) - (Number of programs deleted)

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation:

Number of layers = 11 + (3 x 2) - 2
= 11 + 6 - 2
= 15

So, Dave had 15 more layers than programs on his phone after deleting some of them."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards in total and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can write an equation as follows: 

Number of cards Nell has = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff

Substituting the values we know into this equation, we get:

Number of cards Nell has = 242 - 136
= 106

Therefore, Nell has 106 cards left after giving 136 to Jeff."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 301 cards initially and she gave 154 of them to Jeff. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of cards Nell had = 301
Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 154

Now, let's solve for the number of cards Nell had initially:

Number of cards Nell had initially = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff
= 301 - 154
= 147

Therefore, Nell had 147 cards initially."
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, we can say that Jeff got x number of cards from Nell. Since Jeff had only 11 cards initially, he must have received all of Nell's extra cards (x - 11). Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 41 cards (x = 41).
Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has fewer than that now (she said she has 535). So, Jeff must have received some of those cards from her. Therefore, he now has 535 + x where x is the number of cards Nell gave him. Since Jeff started with 234 cards, we can conclude that x = 301 (since 535 - 234 = 301). So, Jeff now has 234 + 301 = 535 cards.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-karte cards. So, if we subtract the number of ten-karte cards from the total number of baseball cards, we get...

415 - 149 = 266

So, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than she did before."
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card sets initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card sets. To find out how many more ten-card sets than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of ten-card sets from the total number of cards she has: 495 - 214 = 281. So, Nell has 281 more ten-card sets than baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards in total and gave 195 to John. So she has 378 cards left. Now, we are told that she gave some more cards to Jeff. Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the number of cards she has left minus the number of cards she gave to John. In this case, it would be 378 - 195 = 183 cards. So, Nell gave 183 cards to Jeff.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball card packs. To find out how many more baseball cards than ten-card packs Nell has, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball card packs:

Number of baseball card packs = 178
Number of ten-card packs = 55
Difference = Number of baseball card packs - Number of ten-card packs
= 178 - 55
= 123
Therefore, Nell has 123 more baseball card packs than ten-card packs."
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card sets initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has 376 ten-card sets and 111 baseball cards. To find out how many more ten-card sets than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of ten-card sets. So, the difference between 376 and 111 is 265. Therefore, Nell has 265 more ten-card sets than baseball cards.
Response:  Paco had 0 koekies at first (he didn't eat any). Then he ate 19 koekies and gave away 35 koekies. So, how many koekies did he have left after giving them away? Answer: He had 0 koekies left because he gave all of them away!
Response:  Paco had 28 cookies and he ate some of them. He also gave away 7 cookies. So, the number of cookies that Paco ate is equal to the number of cookies he didn't give away. In other words, the number of cookies he ate is 28 - 7 = 21. Therefore, Paco ate 21 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So now he has 38 cookies left. He then bought 3 more cookies, so he has a total of 41 cookies now. Therefore, the number of cookies Paco has is 41.
Response:  Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 cookies left. Then, he buys 3 more cookies. Now, he has 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco has eaten more than what he bought.
Response:  Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So now he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. He then bought 36 more cookies. So, the total number of cookies he has is 11 + 36 = 47 cookies. Therefore, Paco has more cookies than he ate.
Response:  Paco had initially 40 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Therefore, Paco still has 35 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them. So, he has 14 - 14 = 0 cookies left. He gave 13 of the cookies to his friend. So, now his friend has 0 + 13 = 13 cookies. Therefore, Paco ate more cookies than what he gave to his friend.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them. So, he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. He gave his friend 21 cookies out of the ones he had, so his friend got 21 + (-4) = 17 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco gave his friend more cookies than he ate, which is 17 - 16 = 1 more cookie.
Response:  According to the question, Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 savory cookies at first. Then he ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 savory cookies. So, how many cookies did Paco have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had. In this case, that would be: 22 - 15 = 7 sweet cookies and 75 - 54 = 21 savory cookies. Therefore, Paco still has 7 sweet cookies and 21 savory cookies left.
Response:  According to the question, Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies at first. Then he ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 sour cookies. So, after eating, Paco had 36 + 3 = 40 sweet cookies and 3 - 6 = -3 sour cookies. Therefore, Paco still has -3 sour cookies left.
Response:  Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies in total. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies. So, he ate more sweet cookies than salty ones. The difference between the number of sweet cookies he ate and the number of salty cookies he ate is 35 (37 - 2). Therefore, Paco ate 35 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  According to the question, Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies at first. Then he ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 sour cookies in total. To find out how many more sour cookies Paco ate than sweet cookies, we need to subtract the number of sour cookies he had initially from the total number of sour cookies he ate: 34 - 6 = 28. So, Paco ate 28 more sour cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  At first, Paco had 37 cookies. Then he ate 36 of them. So, how many cookies did Paco have left? Answer: 1 cookie.
Response:  Paco had 36 cookies initially and gave 14 to his friend. So he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, Paco still has 22 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave away 9 of them. So he has 32 cookies left (41 - 9 = 32). He then ate 18 more cookies, so now he has 50 cookies (32 + 18 = 50). Therefore, Paco has 50 cookies more than what he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 6 cookies and gave 30 to his friend. So he has given away 30 - 6 = 24 cookies. He also ate 23 cookies, so he has eaten more than he gave away. The difference between what he gave away and what he ate is 24 - 23 = 1 cookie. Therefore, Paco gave away more cookies than he ate.
Response:  According to the question, Paco had 97 cookies and ate 34 of them. So he had 97 - 34 = 63 cookies left. Then, he ate another 15 cookies, leaving him with 63 - 15 = 48 cookies remaining. Therefore, Paco still has 48 cookies left.
Response:  According to the question, Paco had 26 cookies and ate 17 of them. So he had 9 cookies left (26 - 17 = 9). Then, he ate another 14 cookies, leaving him with 0 cookies. Therefore, Paco still has 0 cookies left.
Response:  Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He ate 23 sweet cookies and 32 salty cookies. So, he ate more sweet cookies than salty cookies. The difference between the number of sweet cookies he ate and the number of salty cookies he ate is 23 - 6 = 17. Therefore, Paco ate 17 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  According to the question, Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 savory cookies at first. Then he ate 28 sweet cookies and 15 savory cookies. So, the total number of sweet cookies that Paco ate is 28 + 15 = 43. Therefore, Paco has eaten more savory cookies than sweet cookies (25 - 43 = -18).
Response:  Vir has $7 and gives $5 to her friend. So she has $7 - $5 = $2 left with her.
Response:  Vir has $2 as gift money and spent $8 on something. So she has $2 - $8 = $6 left. Then she gave $6 to her friend. So now Vir has $6 + $6 = $12 left. Therefore, Gwen received $12 from Vir for her birthday.
Response:  Vir has $2 from her mom and then she spent $3. So, she had $2 + $3 = $5 left with her.
Response:  Vir has received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad. She spent $4 of it. So, she has $8 - $4 = $4 left with her mom. Now, we need to find out how much more money she got from her mom than what she gave to her dad. To do this, we subtract the amount she gave to her dad ($4) from the amount she got from her mom ($8): $8 - $4 = $4. Therefore, Vir got $4 more money from her mom than what she gave to her dad.
Response:  Vir has received $3 from her mom and $6 from her dad, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6). She then spent $4, leaving her with $5 ($9 - $4). So, Vir has more money from her dad than from her mom.
Response:  Vir has received $5 from her dad and $7 from her mom, so she has a total of $12. She spent $4 on something, so she now has $8 left. Therefore, she has received more money from her mom than what she got from her dad. The difference is $7 - $5 = $2.
"Response:  Vir has $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom, so she has a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she has $1 left with her. So, she got more money from her dad than what she got from her mom. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Vir got $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom, for a total of $7. She spent $6, leaving her with $1."
Response:  If Josh had 9 knick-knacks and lost some of them, then he has 4 knick-knacks now. So, he lost 5 knick-knacks (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had 21 knick-knacks initially and lost 7 of them, he would have 21 - 7 = 14 left. Now, if he has 12 knick-knacks remaining, that means he started with 14 + 12 = 26 knick-knacks in total. So, originally, Josh had 26 knick-knacks in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 knick-knacks in his collection and then he lost 11 of them. So, he had 8 left (19 - 11 = 8). Now, he found 5 new ones, so he has 13 knick-knacks in total (8 + 5 = 13). Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  Josh had 4 knick-knacks in his collection and lost 16 of them. He found 8 new ones. So, he lost more than what he found. The difference between the number of knick-knacks he lost (16) and the number he found (8) is 8. Therefore, Josh lost 8 knick-knacks more than what he found.
Response:  Josh had 7 knickers in his collection and lost 8 of them. So he had -8 knickers (lost). Now, he found 10 new knickers, so he has +2 knickers (found). Therefore, the difference between what he had lost and what he found is: +2 (-8) = 10. So, Josh found 10 more knickers than he lost.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles in his collection and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left. So, he now has 7 marbles.
Response:  Josh had 20 pennies in his collection and gave 2 to Jack. So now Josh has 18 pennies left.
Response:  Josh had 22 knick-knacks in his collection and Jack gave him 20 of them. So, how many knick-knacks does Josh have now? Answer: Josh has 22 - 20 = 2 knick-knacks left in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 11 knick-knacks and lost them all, he now has none left. So, his current collection of knick-knacks is zero (0).
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 knickers in his collection and then he found 13 more. So, at this point, he has 22 + 13 = 35 knickers. However, later he lost 5 knickers. Therefore, now Josh has 35 - 5 = 30 knickers in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 knickers and found 9 more, then he has a total of 24 knickers now (15 + 9 = 24). However, if he lost 2 knickers, then he would have 22 knickers left (24 - 2 = 22). So, the difference between the number of knickers he found and the number he lost is 7 knickers (9 - 2 = 7).
"Response: 
Josh had 3 knockers in his collection and lost 2. He found 6 new ones while he lost 5. So, how many more knick-knackers does he have than what he lost?
Let X be the number of knick-knackers Josh has after finding 6 new ones. Since he lost 5, we can write:
X = 3 + 6 - 5 = 8
Therefore, Josh has 8 more knick-knackers than what he lost."
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father is 4 pounds + 19 pounds = 23 pounds. So, Marco's share is 23/2 = 11.5 pounds. Therefore, Marco's aardbei weighed more than his father's by 11.5 - 4 = 7.5 pounds.
Response:  The total weight of the beans that Marco and his father have picked is 35 pounds (or 15 kg). Marco has picked 13 pounds (or 6 kg) of beans. So, we need to find out how much more his father has picked than Marco. To do this, we subtract Marco's weight from the total weight: 35 - 13 = 22 pounds (or 10 kg). Therefore, his father has picked 22 pounds (or 10 kg) more beans than Marco.
Response:  Marco and his dad together collected 20 pounds of apples. If Marco's apple collection weighed 17 pounds, then Marco himself must have collected 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3) less than his dad. So, Marco's apple collection weighed 14 pounds (17 - 3 = 14).
Response:  Marco and his father together picked 40 pounds of apples (Marco picked 8 pounds and his father picked 32 pounds). So, they picked a total of 40 pounds of apples together.
"Response: 
Marco and his dad had collected 24 pounds of apples together. On their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds of apples. So, Marco now has 3 pounds of apples left.
To find out how much apple his dad had, we can simply subtract the amount that Marco lost from the total amount they collected:
3 pounds (Marco's remaining apples) = 24 pounds (total amount collected) - 9 pounds (apples lost by Marco)
Therefore, his dad had 21 pounds of apples (24 - 9)."
"Response: 
Marco and his dad went to pick apples together. They collected what weighed 36 pounds. On their way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of apples. Marco now has 12 pounds of apples. How much does Marco's dad have left?
Answer: 24 pounds (36 - 8 = 24)."
"Response: 
Marco and his dad went to pick apples together. They collected what was equivalent to 22 pounds of apples. On their way back home, Marco's dad found another 30 pounds of apples. Marco's total collection of apples now weighs 36 pounds. How much do you think Marco's dad's apples weigh now?"
Response:  If Marco and his dad worked together to pick 37 pounds of apples, then Marco must have picked half of that amount, which is 18.5 pounds (37 / 2 = 18.5). So, Marco's dad must have picked 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 pounds (since he was alone for the remaining 5 pounds).
Response:  Marco had 30 pounds of apples and his father had 17 pounds of apples together they had 47 pounds of apples. So, Marco's apple weigh more than his father's by 23 pounds (47 - 24 = 23).
Response:  Marco's work is 10 pounds and his partner's work is 26 pounds. So, if we subtract Marco's work from the total weight of their work, we get 16 pounds (26 - 10 = 16). Therefore, Marco's partner has done more work than Marco.
Response:  If Marco and his mom worked together to pick apples for 3 hours, then they picked 30 pounds of apples together. Since Marco's mom had already picked 11 pounds before they started working together, we can find out how much Marco picked by subtracting what his mom had already picked from the total amount they picked together. So, Marco picked 30 - 11 = 19 pounds of apples.
"Response:  The number of children on the bus before reaching the stop was 10 (as stated in the question). Now, more children have climbed onto the bus after stopping at the bus stop. So, the total number of children on the bus now is: 10 + however many children climbed onto the bus after stopping =?
Solution: To find out how many children climbed onto the bus after stopping, we need to use the information provided in the question. According to the question, ""nog'n paar"" (meaning ""a few"") children climbed onto the bus after stopping. We don't know exactly how many children this is, but let's assume it's 3 for simplicity. Therefore, the total number of children on the bus now is: 10 + 3 = 13. So, there are 13 children on the bus now."
Response:  We know that there were initially 26 children in the bus and then 38 more children climbed onto the bus at the stop. So, now we have a total of 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially 39 children on the bus and then two more climbed onto the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children on the bus after the stop is: 39 + 2 = 41. Therefore, there were 41 children on the bus before the stop.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus and then some of them got off at the bus stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off. Therefore, we can write: 
Number of children remaining in the bus = Initial number - Number who got off
In this case, the initial number of children in the bus is 43, and the number who got off is 7 (since 7 children climbed out of the bus). So, we can calculate the number of children remaining in the bus as follows: 
Number of children remaining in the bus = 43 - 7 = 36
Therefore, 7 children got off the bus at the bus stop."
Response:  There were initially 41 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the bus stop, leaving 18 children in the bus. So, there are 23 more children who got off at the bus stop than the current number of children in the bus (i.e., 18 - 23 = -5). Therefore, there were 5 more children in the bus before the bus stop than the current number of children in the bus (-5).
Response:  We know that there were initially 21 children in the bus and then 10 of them got off at the bus stop while some others climbed onto the bus. So, the number of children who remained inside the bus is: 21 - 10 = 11. Therefore, 11 children climbed onto the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the bus and then 63 children got off at the bus stop while some climbed back into the bus. So, the total number of children inside the bus afterward is: 5 + (63 - 2) = 60 children. Therefore, more children climbed onto the bus than got off, so the difference between them is: 60 - 2 = 58 children.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and 68 children got off at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after 68 children got off is:

36 + (68 - 68) = 0

Therefore, there were no more children who climbed onto the bus than those who got off."
Response:  The total number of children who got off the bus at the stop is equal to the number of children who climbed onto the bus minus the number of children who were already inside the bus. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children already on board. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total number of children = 22 (as there were initially 22 children in the bus) + 40 (as 40 children climbed onto the bus while others got off). Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the stop is: Number of children who got off = 22 - 2 = 20. So, there were 20 children who got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  The number of children who got off the bus is 82 - 28 = 54. So, the number of children who climbed onto the bus is 30 - 54 = -24. Therefore, there were more children who got off the bus than those who climbed onto it.
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus. Then, 8 children got off the bus while 24 children climbed onto it at the stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 8 + 23 = 31. Therefore, more children got off the bus than boarded it (i.e., 24 - 8 = 16).
Response:  If Bakker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then he must have baked more than what he sold. So, the number of cakes that Bakker baked is equal to the number of cakes he sold plus one (since he did not sell any cake). Therefore, the number of cakes that Bakker baked is 134 - 51 = 83 cakes.
Response:  The baker had initially made 54 cookies and sold some of them. We know that he still has 13 cookies left over. So, to find out how many cookies the baker sold, we can subtract the number of cookies he still has from the initial amount: 54 - 13 = 41. Therefore, the baker sold 41 cookies.
Response:  The baker has sold 145 cookies and still has 72 left over. So he must have made 217 cookies in total (145 + 72 = 217).
Response:  The baker made 155 cookies and his friend bought 140 of them from him. So, if we subtract the number of cookies that his friend bought (140) from the total number of cookies made by the baker (155), we get the remaining number of cookies that the baker has left = 155 - 140 = 15. Therefore, the baker still has 15 cookies left.
Response:  The baker had initially made 121 cookies and sold 105 of them. This means he has 16 (121 - 105) cookies left. Now, he has bought 170 new cookies. So, in total, the baker now has 336 (16 + 170) cookies.
Response:  The baker had 13 chickens to make and sold 9 of them, so he has 4 left (13 - 9 = 4). He then bought 154 new chickens, so he now has a total of 160 chickens (4 + 154 = 168). Therefore, the number of more chickens the baker bought than what he sold is 168 - 9 = 159.
Response:  The baker made 170 cookies and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 remaining (170 - 78 = 92). He then bought 31 new cookies, so now he has 63 more than he had before (92 + 31 = 123). Therefore, the baker sold more cookies than he bought.
Response:  The baker had initially made 110 cookies and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 remaining cookies (110 - 75 = 35). Now, he has made additional 76 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies the baker has now is 35 + 76 = 111 cookies.
Response:  The baker made 144 cookies and sold 71 of them. So he has 73 remaining (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made another 111 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many more cookies the baker made than what he sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies he sold from the total number of cookies he made: 73 + 111 = 184. Therefore, the baker made 184 more cookies than what he sold.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Bakker made 149 chickens and 91 pies. If he sold 10 chickens and 90 pies, how many chickens does Bakker have left? So, Bakker has 139 chickens (149 - 10 = 139).
Response:  The baker had 7 cows and made 148 pieces of bread. If he sold 15 cows and 103 pieces of bread, how many pieces of bread does the baker have left? So, the answer is 29 (148 - 103 = 45).
Response:  The baker had 126 chickens and made 48 pies. If he sold 115 chickens and 81 pies, then how many more chickens did he sell than pies? We can write this as an equation: Number of chickens sold = Number of pies sold + Number of chickens not sold (or number of chickens left unsold) So in this case, we have: Number of chickens sold = 115 + x Where x is the number of chickens that were left unsold or not sold. Now we are given that the baker sold 81 pies. Can you use this information to find out what x is?
Response:  The baker made 19 cows and 131 pieces of bread. If he sold 70 cows and 88 pieces of bread, then we can calculate how many more pieces of bread than cows were made. So, the difference between the number of bread pieces sold and the number of cows sold is equal to the total number of bread pieces made minus the total number of cows made. Therefore, the answer is: 53 (bread) - 46 (cows) = 7.
Response:  The baker had 157 cows and made 169 batches of bread. If he sold 158 cows and 147 batches of bread, then how many more cows did he sell than bread? So, the answer is 15 - 14 = 1 more cow was sold than bread.
Response:  The baker had 54 cows and made 143 batches of bread. If he sold 68 cows and 92 batches of bread, then we can calculate how many more batches of bread were sold than cows as follows: Number of batches of bread sold = 92 - 68 = 24 More batches of bread were sold than cows.
Response:  The baker sold 44 cakes initially and made 48 cakes in total. So, if he had 48 cakes to sell, how many would he have left after selling 44 of them? Therefore, the number of cakes the baker has left is 48 - 44 = 14.
Response:  The baker initially made 40 cookies and sold 8 of them. So, he must have made more than what he sold. In other words, the difference between the number of cookies he made (40) and the number he sold (8) is equal to the number of cookies he still has (32). Therefore, the baker has 32 cookies left.
Response:  The baker has bought 137 cows and made 169 chickens initially. So, if he still has some chickens left after selling all his initial production of 169 chickens, then he must have sold at least 137 - 169 = -32 chickens. Since we cannot sell negative chickens, it means that the baker does not have any chickens left to sell. Therefore, the correct answer is zero (0) chickens.
Response:  Bakker had initially 173 cows and bought 103 more. So, he now has 276 (173 + 103) cows. Then, he bought another 86 cows, so his current number of cows is 362 (276 + 86). Therefore, Bakker still has 362 cows.
Response:  The baker had initially made 99 cakes and then bought 167 new cakes. He sold 89 cakes, so he has 80 cakes left (167 - 89 = 80). So, the baker bought more cakes than he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes he bought and the number he sold is 80 - 89 = -13.
Response:  The baker had 8 cows made and then bought 139 new cows. He sold 145 cows. So, we need to find out how many more cows he sold than what he bought. We can do this by subtracting the number of cows he bought from the number of cows he sold: 145 - 139 = 6. Therefore, the baker sold 6 more cows than what he bought.
"Response:  The baker has made 62 cakes and sold 144 of them. So he still has some left. Let's calculate how many he still has:

Total number of cakes = Number made - Number sold = 62 - 144 = -82

So the baker still has -82 cakes."
Response:  The baker made 81 cakes and then made another 92 cakes. So in total he made 173 cakes (81 + 92). He sold 46 of them, which means that he left with 127 cakes (173 - 46). Therefore, the baker made more cakes than what he sold.
Response:  The baker had 61 pieces of bread and 167 cookies to start with. If he sold 108 cookies and 44 pieces of bread, then... (1) He has 61 - 44 = 17 pieces of bread left. (2) He has 167 - 108 = 59 cookies left. Therefore, the baker still has 17 pieces of bread and 59 cookies.
Response:  The baker had initially 56 pieces of bread and 124 cookies to sell. He sold 104 cookies and 29 pieces of bread, so he has 37 remaining pieces of bread (56 - 29 = 37). Therefore, the baker still has 37 pieces of bread left.
Response:  The baker made 52 bread rolls and 84 cookies. If he sold 102 cakes and 94 bread rolls, then he must have sold more cakes than bread rolls. So, the difference between the number of cakes and bread rolls is equal to the total number of cakes sold minus the total number of bread rolls sold. Therefore, the difference is 102 - 84 = 18. Thus, the baker sold 18 more cakes than bread rolls.
Response:  The baker made 134 bread rolls and 11 cakes. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 bread rolls, then we can calculate how many more bread rolls than cakes were sold. So, the difference between the number of bread rolls sold (92) and the number of cakes sold (140) is 48. Therefore, the baker made 48 more bread rolls than cakes.
"Response:  The baker had 14 cows and made 153 pieces of bread. If he sold 8 bread rolls and 97 cows, then how many more cows did he sell than bread rolls? 
To find out, we need to subtract the number of bread rolls from the total number of cows. So, if he sold 8 bread rolls and there were 153 pieces of bread in total, that means he sold 145 cows (153 - 8). Therefore, the baker sold 145 more cows than bread rolls."
Response:  The baker had 154 pieces of bread and sold 78 of them. So he has 76 remaining (154 - 78 = 76). He also had 43 cows and sold 114 of them. So he has 31 remaining (43 - 114 = 31). Therefore, the baker sold more bread than cows.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she wants to have 140 games in total, then she needs to buy 118 more games. So, she needs to spend $118 on Nintendo games.
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she wants to give away 64 of them, then we can calculate how many she will have left by subtracting 64 from 106. So, Kelly will be left with 42 Nintendo games.
Response:  Kelly had initially 92 games to play and she played 91 of them. So, the remaining game is 92 - 91 = 1.
Response:  Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away so that she has 12 Nintendo games left, we can divide her total number of Nintendo games (20) by the number of Nintendo games she wants to have left (12). So, Kelly needs to give away 8 Nintendo games (20 - 12 = 8).
Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to reduce them to 31 Sony games. To do this, she needs to subtract 15 (the number of Sony games she already has) from her total number of games, which is 46. So, Kelly needs to give away 15 Nintendo games to have 31 Sony games.
Response:  Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and wants to reduce it to 6 trades. To do this, she needs to give away 74 games (80 - 6 = 74).
Response:  If Randy has 52 blocks and he uses 38 of them to build a tower, then he must have had 14 blocks left over before building the tower (52 - 38 = 14).
Response:  If Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower, then there are fewer than 97 blocks left for him to use. We don't know exactly how many blocks he used for the tower, but we do know that there are 72 blocks over the top of it. So if he used x blocks for the tower, then there are 97 - x blocks left for him to use.
Response:  We have used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, there are 14 + 11 = 25 blocks left.
Response:  If Randy has 58 blocks and he uses 27 blocks to build a tower, then he has 58 - 27 = 31 blocks left. Now, if he wants to build a house using 53 blocks, how many blocks will be left after building the house? So, the number of blocks used to build the house is equal to the number of blocks left, which is 31 blocks. Therefore, Randy used 31 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
"Response:  We know that Randy has used 37 blocks in total to build both the tower and the house. Since he built the tower with 33 blocks and the house with 13 blocks, we can calculate how many more blocks he used for the tower as follows:

Number of blocks used for the tower = Number of blocks used for the house + Number of blocks used for the tower
= 33 + 13
= 46

Therefore, Randy used 46 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response:  We know that Randy has used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. So we can write an equation:

Number of blocks used for the house = Number of blocks used for the tower + 3

Now we need to solve for the number of blocks used for the house. Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of blocks used for the house = 79 + 3 = 82

Therefore, Randy used 82 blocks more to build the house than he did to build the tower."
Response:  We know that Randy had 59 blocks initially and he used 36 of them to build a tower. So, we can calculate how many blocks Randy had left by subtracting the number of blocks he used from the total number of blocks he had: 59 - 36 = 23. Therefore, Randy had 23 blocks left after building the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. So far, he has used a total of 70 blocks (20 + 50). Now we want to find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the tower than he did for the house. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used: 70 - 20 = 50. Therefore, Randy used 50 more blocks to build the tower than he did for the house.
"Response:  We know that Randy has used 90 blocks in total to build both houses and towers. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of blocks used for house = 90 - 89 (blocks used for house)

Similarly, we can write another equation for the number of blocks used for the tower:

Number of blocks used for tower = 90 - 63 (blocks used for tower)

Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously to find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than the tower:

Number of blocks used for house = 90 - 89 = 1

Number of blocks used for tower = 90 - 63 = 27

Therefore, Randy used 27 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response:  If there are 20 books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series and you have already read 5 of them, then you have read 5/20 = 1/4 or 25% of the total number of books in the series."
"Response:  We know that you have read 13 books from the Crazy Silly School series and there are still 8 more books to be read. Therefore, the total number of books in the series is:

13 + 8 = 21

So, there are 21 books in the Crazy Silly School series."
"Response:  If there are 22 books and 10 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series, that means you have already read 12 books and watched 56 movies. To find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books in the series: 22 - 12 = 10. So, you still need to read 10 more books from the series."
"Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series, then there are still 10 movies left to watch (19 - 7 = 12). So, you need to watch 10 more movies from that series."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the Crazy Silly School series. If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, then we can calculate how many more books than movies there are in the series as follows:

Number of books - Number of movies = Total number of books + Total number of movies
= 19 - 13 = 6 (books) + 13 (movies)
= 19 + 13 = 32
Therefore, there are 32 books in the Crazy Silly School series for every 13 movies."
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the Crazy Silly School series. If you have read 19 books and watched 61 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series as follows: Number of movies = 61 - 19 = 42 More movies than books. Therefore, there are 42 more movies than books in the Crazy Silly School series.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than movies you have watched as follows:

Number of books read = 13
Number of movies watched = 12
Difference = Number of books read - Number of movies watched
= 13 - 12
= 1
So, you have read one more book than movie in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 7 of the books and watched 21 of the movies, then we can calculate how many more movies than books you have seen as follows:

Movies = Books + (Number of movies watched - Number of books read)
= 11 + (21 - 7)
= 11 + 14
= 25

Therefore, you have seen 25 more movies than books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  If there are 8 books that Jy has read from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series and there are 14 different books in the series, then we need to find out how many more books Jy needs to read. To do this, we can use division. We divide the number of books Jy has read (8) by the total number of books in the series (14). This gives us the answer: 6. So, Jy still needs to read 6 more books from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies from the ""Crazy Silly School"" series, then you still need to read 58 books (62 - 4 = 58)."
Response:  If there are 8 movies and you have seen 7 of them, that means you still need to watch 1 movie. Similarly, if there are 21 books and you have read 7 of them, that means you still need to read 14 books. So, in total, you need to watch 1 movie and read 14 books.
Response:  We know that there are 14 different books and 15 different movies in the Crazy Silly School series. If you have read 11 books and watched 40 movies, then we can calculate how many more books than movies there are in the series as follows: Number of books - Number of movies = Total number of books + Total number of movies The difference between the number of books and movies is equal to the total number of books plus the total number of movies. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: 11 - 40 = 51 (books) + 15 (movies) Therefore, there are 36 more books than movies in the Crazy Silly School series.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the Crazy Silly School series. If you have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series as follows:

Movies - Books = (63 - 13) = 50

So, there are 50 more movies than books in the Crazy Silly School series."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 14 of the movies and 19 of the books, then we can calculate how many more books you have read than movies as follows:

Books read - Movies watched = Number of more books read
= 19 - 14 = 5

So, you have read 5 more books than movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 19 of the movies and 16 of the books, then we can calculate how many more movies than books you have seen as follows:
Movies - Books = (19 - 16) = 3
So, you have seen 3 more movies than books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
Response:  If Dave has 7 cards and he uses some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 3 cards for that purpose (since he had 7 cards initially). So, the number of cards Dave used to buy toys is 3. Therefore, there are 4 remaining cards in his hand (7 - 3 = 4).
Response:  If Dave has already won 12 cards and he still has 14 cards left, then he must have started with 26 cards (12 + 14 = 26). So, he must have bought 26 - 12 = 14 toys.
Response:  If Dave has won 18 cards and he used them to buy 5 toys and 11 clothes, then we need to calculate how many cards he had left after buying those items. So, if he bought 5 toys with 18 cards, that means he had 13 cards left (18 - 5 = 13). And if he bought 11 clothes with 13 cards, that means he had 2 cards left (13 - 11 = 2). Therefore, Dave has 2 cards left.
Response:  If Dave has used 19 cards to buy toys and he has used 7 cards to buy clothes, then we can say that for every card he uses to buy toys, he uses approximately 3 cards to buy clothes (since 19 / 7 = 3). So if he uses x cards to buy toys, he will use 3x cards to buy clothes. Therefore, the number of more cards Dave uses to buy toys than to buy clothes is 3x - 7 = 6x - 7.
"Response:  If Dave has used 8 cards to buy toys and 18 cards to buy clothes, then he must have used more cards for buying clothes than for buying toys. So, the number of cards Dave uses for buying clothes is greater than the number of cards he uses for buying toys. We can write this as an inequality:

More than = 18 - 8 = 10

So, Dave uses at least 10 cards to buy clothes."
Response:  If Dave won 14 cards and lost 2, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 cards left. Since he used them all to buy toys, he has no cards left. So, the answer is 0 (zero).
Response:  If Haley had 14 bombs in her backyard and 9 of them died during the tornado, then we can assume that 5 of them survived (14 - 9 = 5). So, the answer is 5 more bombs died than survived during the tornado.
Response:  If Haley had 13 bombs in her backyard and 6 of them survived the tornado, then we can assume that 7 bombs did not survive (13 - 6 = 7). So, there were 7 more bombs that survived the tornado than the ones that died (7 > 1).
Response:  If Haley had 20 bombs in her backyard and after the storm, 4 of them were left intact, then we can assume that 16 bombs (20 - 4) were destroyed or damaged during the storm. Therefore, 16 bombs died in the storm.
Response:  If Haley had 5 plants in her backyard before the tornado hit and 12 plants grew after the storm, then we can calculate the total number of plants as follows: Total Number of Plants = Number of Plants Before + Number of New Plants = 5 + 12 = 17 plants.
Response:  Haley had 9 plants growing behind her house before the storm. After the storm, 4 of them died. So, she has 9 - 4 = 5 plants left. Therefore, Haley still has 5 plants growing behind her house.
Response:  The question is asking about how many homes Na'n Tifoon had before he died. According to the text, Na'n Tifoon initially grew 12 homes. So, the answer is 12.
Response:  The initial three trees that survived the tornado had 10 more trees killed than they produced (i.e., 10 - 3 = 7). Therefore, if we assume that each tree produces 3 offspring per year, then the total number of new trees produced by all the surviving trees would be 7 x 3 = 21. So, in total, there were 21 new trees produced after the tornado.
Response:  The question is asking how many more homes were affected by the tornado compared to those that survived. We know that 11 homes initially grew corn and then died due to the tornado. So, if we assume that all of these 11 homes were destroyed by the tornado, then the number of homes affected by the tornado would be equal to the total number of homes minus the number of homes that survived (i.e., 10 - 11 = -1). Therefore, the answer is -1 home was affected by the tornado compared to those that survived.
"Response:  If they find 66 bags per day and each bag contains 28 lemons, then we can calculate how many lemons they have in total per day as follows:

Total number of bags = Number of bags found per day x Total number of bags found per day
= 66 x?

Where? is the unknown quantity that we want to find out. So, we substitute the value given in the question into the equation above:

Total number of bags = 66 x 28
= 1744

Therefore, they have 1744 lemons per day."
Response:  If they produce 8 bags of lemons per day, it will take them 3 days to produce 24 bags of lemons (24 / 8 = 3).
Response:  If it took 4 days to make the lemons, then they made 14 lemons in total (4 x 3 = 12). So, if they had 56 lemons altogether, that means they made 42 lemons more than they already had (56 - 14 = 42). Therefore, they made 42 lemons per day.
"Response:  If they pick up 38 bags of lemons per day and each bag contains 42 lemons, then after 49 days of work, they will have picked up:

38 bags/day x 49 days = 1767 bags

So, they will have 1767 x 42 lemons/bag = 75,008 lemons in total after 49 days of work."
"Response:  If they produce 66 bags per day and each bag contains 25 lemons, then after 87 days of production, they will have produced a total of:

66 bags/day x 87 days = 5,902 bags

So, the total number of lemons produced in 87 days is:

5,902 bags x 25 lemons/bag = 147,550 lemons"
"Response:  If they produce 8 bags per day and each bag contains 35 lemons, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many lemons are produced in one day.
Lemons produced = Number of bags x Number of lemons per bag
= 8 x 35
= 280 lemons

Therefore, they produce 280 lemons per day."
Response:  If they produce 16 bags per day and each bag contains 57 lemons, then it will take them 80 days to produce 80 bags of lemons. Therefore, the answer is 80 days.
Response:  If they pick up 67 baskets per day and each basket contains 12 lemons, then they will pick up a total of 804 lemons (67 x 12 = 804) per day. Now, if they pick up 35 baskets of apples, how many apples will they pick up in total? So, the answer is 35 x 12 = 420 apples.
"Response:  If they throw away 71 bags of apples every day and there are 74 bags per day in total, then after 51 days they will have thrown away a total of:

71 x 51 = 3621 bags of apples

So, they will have approximately 3621 bags of apples left after 51 days."
Response:  If they throw away 64 bags per day and each bag contains 50 lemons, then they throw away 3200 lemons per day (64 x 50 = 3200).
"Response:  If they use 28 ripe lemons and 52 unripe lemons per day for 26 days, then after 26 days they will have used a total of:
Ripe lemons = 28 x 26 = 704 ripe lemons
Unripe lemons = 52 x 26 = 1328 unripe lemons
So, after 26 days they will have harvested a total of:
Apples = 704 + 1328 = 2032 apples."
"Response:  If they use 82 ripened lemons and 61 unripe lemons per day for 25 days, then after 25 days they will have used a total of:
Ripened lemons = 82 x 25 = 2050 ripe lemons
Unripened lemons = 61 x 25 = 1525 unripe lemons
So, after 25 days they will have a total of 3575 lemons (2050 + 1525)."
"Response:  If they use 31 ripened lemons and 24 unripe lemons per day for 45 days, then after 45 days they will have used a total of:

Total number of ripe lemons = 31 x 45 = 1375
Total number of unripe lemons = 24 x 45 = 1050

So, after 45 days, they will have 1375 ripe lemons and 1050 unripe lemons in total."
"Response:  If they use 44 bags of ripe lemons and 25 bags of unripe lemons per day, then we can calculate how many more bags of ripe lemons are used per day as follows:

Total number of bags of lemons used per day = 44 + 25 = 69 bags/day

So, there are 69 more bags of ripe lemons used per day than unripe lemons."
Response:  If they use 5 ripe lemons and 74 unripe lemons per day to make juice, then we can calculate how many more unripe lemons are used than ripe lemons. So, if 5 x = 35 (since there are 5 ripe lemons), then 74 - 35 = 39 unripe lemons are used for every 5 ripe lemons used. Therefore, the ratio of unripe lemons to ripe lemons is 39:20 or 1.95 times more unripe lemons than ripe lemons are used per day.
"Response:  If they picked up 54 lemons in total and it took them 18 days to pick them all, then we can calculate how many lemons they picked up each day as follows:

Number of lemons picked up per day = Total number of lemons / Number of days taken
= 54 / 18
= 3

So, they picked up 3 lemons per day."
"Response:  If they picked up 56 lemons in total and took 14 days to pick them, then we can calculate how many lemons they picked up each day as follows:

Number of lemons per day = Total number of lemons / Number of days taken
= 56 / 14
= 4 lemons per day
Therefore, they picked up 4 lemons per day during their 14-day trip."
"Response:  If they use 25 unripe lemons and 5 ripe lemons per day for 73 days, then after 73 days they will have used a total of:

Unripe lemons = 25 x 73 = 1825
Ripe lemons = 5 x 73 = 365

So, in total, they will have 1825 unripe lemons and 365 ripe lemons after 73 days."
"Response:  If they have 65 unripe lemons and 46 ripe lemons per day, after 6 days they will have:

Unripe lemons: 65 x 6 = 390
Ripe lemons: 46 x 6 = 276
Total lemons: 390 + 276 = 666
So, after 6 days, they will have 666 lemons in total."
"Response:  If they found 41 unripe lemons and 86 ripe lemons per day, then the number of more ripe lemons per day is equal to the difference between the total number of lemons found and the number of unripe lemons divided by 2 (since there are only two types of lemons). So, we can calculate it like this:
Total number of lemons = 41 + 86 = 127
Number of unripe lemons = 41
Number of ripe lemons = 86
Difference in numbers = Total number of lemons - Number of unripe lemons = 127 - 41 = 86
So, the number of more ripe lemons per day is 86."
"Response:  If they found 71 unripe lemons and 60 ripe lemons per day, then the number of more unripe lemons than ripe lemons is:

More unripe lemons = Total unripe lemons - Ripe lemons
= 71 - 60
= 11

So, there are 11 more unripe lemons than ripe lemons per day."
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer her room is than its width, we can use the formula: Length = Width x 2 + Height. Since we are given that the height of Jesse's room is 8 feet, we can plug in these values to get: Length = 11 x 2 + 8 = 22 feet. So, Jesse's room is 22 feet long.
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs a room of size 14 square feet and she is 2 meters tall (or 6 feet). So we can start with an estimate of how wide her room should be to accommodate her height. If we assume that one foot is equal to 0.305 meters (which is roughly the conversion factor between feet and meters), then we can calculate the width of her room as follows:
Width = Height x Conversion Factor
= 6 ft x 0.305 m/ft
= 1.827 m or approximately 6.0 feet
So, based on this calculation, Jesse's room would need to be at least 6 feet wide to accommodate her height comfortably. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and there are many other factors that could affect the actual dimensions of her room, such as furniture placement, door sizes, etc."
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 2 meters long and she needs a rug with an area of 14 square feet. To find out how long her room is in feet, we can use the conversion factor between meters and feet: 1 meter = 3.2808 feet. So, if Jesse's room is 2 meters long, it is equal to 6.562 feet (2 x 3.2808). Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 6.562 feet.
Response:  The length of Jesse is 11 feet and its width is 15 feet. To find out how much more tiles it needs to cover the whole floor, we need to calculate the area of the floor first. The area of the floor = Length x Width = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. So, Jesse needs 165 - 40 = 125 additional tiles to cover the whole floor.
Response:  We know that Jesse is 2 feet tall and the floor is 12 feet wide. Since each tile covers 4 square feet of space, we need to divide the total area of the floor by the size of one tile to find out how many tiles Jesse needs to cover the entire floor. Therefore, the number of tiles needed = Total area of the floor / Size of one tile = 12 x 4 = 48 tiles.
Response:  The total area of all 20 rooms is equal to the length times width of each room. So, if Jesse's room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, then the area of his room is 19 x 18 = 342 square feet. Since there are 20 rooms in total, the total area of all the rooms is 342 square feet x 20 = 6,840 square feet. Therefore, it would take Jesse approximately 6,840 square feet of flooring material to cover the floor of all 20 rooms.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room can be calculated as follows: Length = Breath x Height. So if her room is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long, then its length would be 19 x 20 = 380 feet. Therefore, Jesse's room is 380 feet long.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a mat of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since her room is 5 feet long, we can find out how wide it is by dividing its length by 4 (since there are 4 feet in a foot). So, the width of Jessie's room is 5/4 = 1.25 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a mat of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since her room is 2 feet wide, we can find the length of her room as follows: Length = Width x Area needed for mat / Total area of mat = 2 ft x 10 sq ft / 10 sq ft = 20 ft Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 20 feet.
Response:  The area of one square foot is equal to 1 x 1 = 1 square foot. So, if Jesse has 18 four-square feet of mat, then the total area of her mat is equal to 18 x 1 = 18 square feet. Now, we need to find out how much more mat she needs to cover the entire floor. To do this, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length of the room is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, so the area of the room is equal to 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 18 - 80 = -62 square feet of mat to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $23 and they sold 150 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. Therefore, the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts was $23 x 150 = $3450. So, they made a profit of $3450 - $230 = $3220.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game was $51. So, to find out the cost of each T-shirt, we can divide the total cost by the number of T-shirts sold: $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold during both games is 95. During the Arkansas game, they sold 47 T-shirts, so the amount of money made per T-shirt sold during that game is: $87 / 47 = $1.80 per T-shirt.
Response:  We know that during both games (Arkansas and Texas Tech), they sold a total of 242 T-shirts. During the Arkansas game, they sold 115 T-shirts. So, to find out how many T-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of T-shirts they sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of T-shirts they sold: 242 - 115 = 127. Therefore, they sold 127 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold during both games is 163 + 89 = 252 T-shirts. Since each T-shirt costs $98, the total amount of money made from selling T-shirts during these two games is: Total Amount = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = 252 x $98 = $24,704.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold during both games is 186. During the Arkansas game, they sold 172 T-shirts, so they made $78 per T-shirt sold. Therefore, during the Texas Tech game, they made $78 x 54 = $4304 in revenue from selling T-shirts.
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold is 183 + 31 = 214. Since each t-shirt costs $62, the total revenue from selling t-shirts is 214 x $62 = $13,058.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 74 + 156 = 230. Since each shirt costs $67 and each hat costs $165, we can calculate the total revenue from shirts as follows: Total Revenue from Shirts = Number of Shirts x Price per Shirt = 230 x $67 = $15,930. Similarly, the total revenue from hats is: Total Revenue from Hats = Number of Hats x Price per Hat = 230 x $165 = $38,750. Therefore, the total amount of money made through the sale of both shirts and hats is: Total Revenue = Total Revenue from Shirts + Total Revenue from Hats = $15,930 + $38,750 = $54,680.
"Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold is given as 157 and the total number of shirts sold is also given as 19. So we have two equations:
T-shirt sales = 157
Shirt sales = 19 + 157
Now solve for ""T-shirt sales - Shirt sales"":
T-shirt sales - Shirt sales = 157 - (19 + 157)
= 157 - 176
= -$29
So, the t-shirts cost more than the shirts by $29."
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is 254 + 43 = 297. Since each shirt costs $86 and each hat costs $232, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Shirt Revenue = Number of shirts x Price per shirt = 297 x $86 = $25,102 Hat Revenue = Number of hats x Price per hat = 297 x $232 = $65,554 Therefore, the difference between the revenue from hats and shirts is: Difference = Hat Revenue - Shirt Revenue = $65,554 - $25,102 = $40,452 So, the number of hats sold is greater than the number of shirts sold by $40,452.
"Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $51. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold an additional 130 T-shirts at a profit of $8 per shirt. So, their total revenue from selling those extra T-shirts would be:
Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Profit per T-shirt
= 130 T-shirts x $8 per T-shirt
= $1,040
Therefore, the amount of money they made by selling those extra T-shirts is $1,040."
Response:  The price of each T-shirt is $201, and they sold 14 T-shirts during the competition between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, the total amount of money they made from selling those T-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Amount = Number of T-shirts x Price of each T-shirt = 14 x $201 = $2850. Therefore, they made $2850 in profit from selling those 14 T-shirts.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is given as $60. If they earn $10 for each t-shirt sold, then the number of t-shirts sold can be found using the following equation: Number of t-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per t-shirt. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of t-shirts = $60 / $10 = 6. Therefore, they have sold 6 t-shirts.
Response:  The total amount of money made from selling 5 T-shirts is $215. To find out how much each T-shirt costs, we can divide the total amount by the number of shirts sold: $215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $43.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is 20 x $ 215 = $ 4300. Similarly, the total number of shorts sold is 64 x $ 5 = $ 3200. So, in total, they made $ 7500 from both T-shirts and shorts.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is 158 + 2 = 160. Since each shirt costs $204, the total revenue from shirt sales is 160 x $204 = $32,720. So, they made $32,720 in revenue from selling shirts.
"Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 177 and the total number of shorts sold is given as 23. So we have:
T-shirt sales = 177
Short sales = 23
Now, let's find out how much more T-shirts were sold than shorts:
More T-shirts sold = T-shirt sales - Short sales
= 177 - 23
= 154
So, there were 154 more T-shirts sold than shorts."
"Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 113 and the total number of shorts sold is given as 78. So we have:
T-shirt sales = 113
Shorts sales = 78
Now, let's find out how much more money was made from selling shirts than shorts:
Money made from shirts - Money made from shorts = ($ 115 x 113) - ($ 25 x 78)
= $ 9060 - $ 1950
= $ 7110
So, the Razorbacks made $ 7110 more from selling shirts than they did from selling shorts."
Response:  If they have decided to move the party inside and they have 5 tables with each table having 10 chairs, then we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows: Total number of chairs = Number of tables x Number of chairs per table Total number of chairs = 5 x 10 = 50 chairs So there will be 50 chairs available for guests at the indoor party.
Response:  We know that there are 12 chairs in the backyard and two tables with the same number of chairs. So, each table has 6 chairs. Therefore, for every table, there are 6 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 3 stools at each table and we have to find out how many tables they have. So, if they have 9 stools in their backyard, then they must have 9 x 3 = 27 tables. Therefore, there are 27 tables in their backyard.
"Response:  If they have decided to move the party inside and they have 11 tables with each table having 13 chairs, then we can calculate as follows:

Number of chairs = Number of tables x Number of chairs per table
= 11 x 13
= 133 chairs

Therefore, there are 133 chairs in the backyard."
Response:  We know that there are 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs. So, we have 10 x 6 = 60 chairs in total. Since there are 11 people sitting at the tables, we need to subtract 11 from 60 to find out how many chairs are empty. Therefore, there are 49 empty chairs (60 - 11).
"Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, we have:

12 x 14 = 168 chairs (for all guests)

Now, let's add the extra 6 chairs for the hosts:

168 + 6 = 174 chairs (total number of chairs available for all guests and hosts)

Therefore, the number of chairs available for the guests is 174."
Response:  We know that there are 14 people attending the party and each table has 3 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs needed is: 14 x 3 = 42 chairs. So, they will need to buy 42 more chairs.
Response:  If they have decided to move the party inside and they have 14 chairs for each table, then they will need more than 9 tables if they want to accommodate all their guests. So, we can conclude that they have more than 9 tables. In fact, since they have 14 chairs per table, they must have at least 56 chairs (14 x 9 = 126). Therefore, they have more than 9 tables.
Response:  If Lewis earns $460 in total over 5 weeks, that means he earned an average of $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks).
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1216 during that month and he earns $16 per week, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of weeks in the month.
Weeks in month = Total amount earned / Weekly income
= $1216 / $16
= 78 weeks

Therefore, the month has 78 weeks."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of the year, his total income would be:
$21 x 216 = $4,592
Now, he has to pay taxes of $702, so his take-home pay (money left after taxes) is:
$4,592 - $702 = $3,890
Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $3,890 in his pocket."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 every week during the 223 weeks of the season, then he will have earned:

$1357 x 223 = $294,610

So, if Lewis works for 73 seasons, he will have earned:

$294,610 x 73 = $20,833,300

Therefore, Lewis will have earned $20,833,300 working for 73 seasons."
"Response: 
Lewis earns $28 per week during the 109 weeks of the season. He also works overtime and earns $939 per week for that work. So, in total, he earns:
$28 x 109 = $2,872 per season from regular work.
Adding his overtime pay brings the total to:
$2,872 + ($939 x number of overtime hours) =?
Let's assume he worked 20 hours of overtime per week (which is a rough estimate). Therefore, the total amount earned by Lewis during the season would be:
$2,872 + ($939 x 20) = $4,658 per season."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $403 every week for 233 weeks of the season, he will have earned a total amount of money during that time period. To find out how much money he earned, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he worked:
$403 x 233 = $93,530
Therefore, Lewis earned $93,530 during the season."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week and pays $388 in rent every week for 1359 weeks during the season, he will have to pay a total of:
Total amount paid = Number of weeks x Weekly rent
= 1359 x $388
= $524,770
Therefore, Lewis will have to pay $524,770 in rent over the course of the season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week and has to pay rent of $216 per week, then his total income for each week is $491 - $216 = $275. Since there are 1181 weeks in a season, he will have earned a total of $275 x 1181 = $309,375 during that season.
"Response:  If Virgil earns $133 in total and works for 19 weeks, then he earns:
Virgil's weekly income = Total amount earned / Number of weeks worked
= $133 / 19 weeks
= $7 per week"
Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per hour and works for 40 hours in one week, then he earns $80 per week (40 x $2). Since he earns a total of $178, that means he worked for 22 weeks ($178 / $80 = 22). Therefore, the number of weeks the oes lasted is 22 weeks.
"Response:  If they jumped from a height of 9 feet (Dean's height), and the water is 10 times deeper than that, then...

Step 1: Calculate how deep the water is compared to Dean's height.
Water depth = 10 x Height of Dean = 10 x 9 = 90 feet

So, the water is 90 feet deep compared to Dean's height."
Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron stands at 14 feet tall, then Dean stands at 6 feet (14 - 8 = 6) tall. Now we are told that the depth of the water is twice Dean's height, which means it is twice 6 feet or 12 feet deep. Therefore, the water is 12 feet deep.
Response:  We know that when they jumped in, it was 5 times higher than Ron's height. So if Ron is 6 feet tall (72 inches), then the depth of the water would be 360 inches (5 x 72). Since Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, he would be at a depth of 240 inches (360 - 11 = 240) below the surface.
Response:  We know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so if Ron stands at 13 feet tall, then Dean stands at 17 feet tall (13 + 4 = 17). Now we are told that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, which means it is 15 x 17 = 255 feet deep (15 x 17 = 255). Therefore, the water is 255 feet deep.
Response:  We know that when they jumped in, it was 16 times higher than Ron's height. So if Ron is 13 feet tall, then the depth of the water would be 16 x 13 = 208 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron is 15 feet long and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, which means he is 9 times deeper in the water than Ron. So if the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height, then it would be 9 x 6 = 54 feet deep.
Response:  If Brian has written 34 books and he has divided them into two book boxes, then each box must contain how many books? We can calculate this by dividing the total number of books (34) by the number of boxes (2). So, there are 17 books in each box.
Response:  If Brian has written 42 books and each book contains an average of 2 pages per book (as mentioned in the question), then we can calculate the total number of pages Brian has written as follows: Total pages = Number of books x Pages per book Total pages = 42 x 2 = 84 pages Now, if we divide the total number of pages by the number of books he has written, we get the average number of pages per book: Average pages per book = Total pages / Number of books Average pages per book = 84 / 42 = 2 pages per book Therefore, Brian has written approximately 2 pages per book.
"Response:  According to the question, Brian has written 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 book racks. Therefore, he has written a total number of books equal to the product of the number of book racks and the number of magazines he wrote per rack: 
Total number of books = Number of book racks x Number of magazines/racks
= 23 x 80
= 1860 books
Therefore, Brian has written 1860 books in total."
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book contains 46 articles, then he has a total of 9 x 46 = 424 articles from his books alone. So far so good! Now let's consider his magazines. He has 46 magazines, which means he has a total of 46 x 4 = 184 pages from his magazines. Therefore, the total number of pages Brian has read is 424 + 184 = 608 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Brian has written 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 book racks. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of books as follows: Total no. of books = Number of book racks x No. of books per rack Total no. of books = 29 x 23 = 677 books Similarly, we can calculate the total number of magazines as follows: Total no. of magazines = Number of magazine racks x No. of magazines per rack Total no. of magazines = 29 x 61 = 1749 magazines So, Brian has written a total of 677 books and 1749 magazines.
Response:  If Brian has written 7 book racks with each containing an equal number of books, then we can say that he has written a total of 7 x 7 = 49 books. So there are 49 books in every bookrack.
"Response:  If Brian has already read 38 books and each book rack contains 2 books, then...

1. How many book racks does Brian have if he has already read 38 books?

Book racks = Number of books / 2 (since each rack contains 2 books)
Book racks = 38 / 2 = 19

So, Brian has 19 book racks."
Response:  If Carol invited 10 friends to her birthday party and she bought each of them an invitation (which cost $2), then she spent a total of $2 x 10 = $20 on invitations. So, she had $20 / 2 = $10 left over after buying the invitations for all 10 friends.
"Response:  Since Carol sent gifts to 12 friends, and each gift contained three invitations, then the total number of invitations is:

12 x 3 = 36

Therefore, there were 36 invitations in total."
"Response:  If Carol has sent invitations to 10 friends and each friend received 5 invitations (as stated in the problem), then the total number of invitations that Carol has sent is:

10 x 5 = 50 invitations
Therefore, there will be 50 invitations in total."
Response:  We know that Carol has sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party and she has received 14 invitations in total. She also bought 6 additional invitations, so the total number of invitations is now 20 (14 + 6). Since each invitation costs $5, the total cost of all invitations is $100 (20 x $5). Now we are asked how many friends can Carol invite based on the information provided. Based on the fact that each invitation costs $5 and there are 20 invitations in total, we can infer that Carol has enough money to invite up to 20 friends ($100 / $5 per invitation = 20 friends). Therefore, the answer is 20 friends.
Response:  If Carol has already sent three invitations and she wants to give each of her 9 friends an extra invitation, then she will need to buy 9 x 3 = 27 more invitations in total.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each of the 5 tries she played, then she scored a total of 12 x 5 = 60 points. Since she scored 36 points overall, that means she did not score all her points in the first 5 tries. So, she must have scored at least one point in additional try(s). Therefore, the number of tries she played is greater than or equal to 6.
Response:  According to the question, Melissa scored 3 three-pointers and 52 two-point shots for a total of 81 points. To find out how many points she scored in each type of shot, we can divide her total score by the number of shots she took. So, if she scored 3 three-pointers, that means she got 3 x 3 = 9 points from those shots. And if she scored 52 two-point shots, that means she got 52 x 2 = 104 points from those shots. Therefore, Melissa scored 9 + 104 = 113 points from her three-pointers and 2-point shots combined.
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each of the 79 competitions she participated in and also received 82 bonus points for every competition, then her total score would be calculated as follows: Total Score = (Number of Competitions x Points per Competition) + Bonus Points Total Score = (79 x 109) + (79 x 82) Total Score = 6,534 + 6,254 Total Score = 12,788 Therefore, Melissa scored 12,788 points in the 79 competitions she participated in.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and she got 7 points in each game, then we can calculate how many games she played as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa got 91 points in total and each try was worth the same amount of points, then we can write an equation as follows: Total points = Number of tries x Points per try So, if Melissa got 91 points in total, that means she got 91/x points in each try, where x is the number of tries she took. Now, we are given that Melissa took 13 tries, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Total points = 91 / 13 points per try So, to find out how many points Melissa got in each try, we need to divide the total points by the number of tries she took: 91 / 13 = x points per try Therefore, Melissa got 7 points per try (since 91 / 13 = 7).
"Response:  The Reuzens Rad has 4 seats and there are 20 people at the same time who want to ride it. Therefore, we can calculate how many people can fit in each seat as follows:
Number of people per seat = Total number of people / Number of seats
= 20 / 4
= 5
So, 5 people can fit in each seat on the Reuzens Rad in Paradise Park."
Response:  The Reuzensrad has several seats that can accommodate 9 people each. If 18 people ride the wheel at the same time, we need to divide the number of seats by the number of people riding the wheel. Therefore, there are 18 / 9 = 2 seats available for every person riding the wheel. So, the total number of seats is 2 x 18 = 36 seats.
"Response:  The number of seats in each giant wheel is 19 and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride at the same time is:

19 x 15 = 285 people
So, 20 giant wheels can accommodate 285 people at the same time."
Response:  The Reuzensrad has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then we have to calculate how many people can ride at the same time on the giant wheel. So, the number of people who can ride simultaneously = Total capacity of the wheel / Number of available seats = 18 x 15 = 270 people. Therefore, 270 people can ride on the Giant Wheel at the same time if 10 seats are broken.
Response:  The Reuzens Rad has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people, so there are 6 x 14 = 84 people who can ride at once. Since there are already 16 people on the wheel, we have reached our maximum capacity of 84 - 16 = 68 people who can still get on the wheel.
Response:  The small seats can accommodate 14 people and the large seats can accommodate 54 people. So, if we want to know how many people can ride on the big wheel on the small seats, we need to divide the number of people who can fit on the big wheel by the number of people who can fit on each small seat. Therefore, the answer is: 54 / 14 = 3.86 (round down to 3).
Response:  The small seats can accommodate 16 people and the large seats can accommodate 12 people. So, if we have 7 large seats, that means we can accommodate 84 people (7 x 12 = 84). Therefore, the number of people who can ride the big wheel on the large seats is 84.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride on the giant wheel at the same time and it has 4 seats per car, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many cars can fit on the wheel. So, the answer is 4 cars.
Response:  Since four people can ride on the same time in the giant wheel at the amusement park, we know that each seat on the wheel has space for two people. Therefore, there are twice as many seats on the wheel as there are people who can ride on it simultaneously. So, if four people can ride on the wheel at the same time, then there must be eight seats on the wheel.
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices (let's call it x), then the total number of slices in all 7 pizzas would be 7x. Since there were 14 skies in total, the number of slices in each pizza would be 14/7 = 2.
Response:  If there are 28 slices and each slice has two sides (snye), then we have to divide 28 by 2 to get the number of pizzas. So, we have 14 pizzas.
Response:  If we have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 skys (or slices), then the total number of skys will be: 17 x 4 = 68 skys. So there are 68 skys in total.
Response:  We have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 skies. Therefore, we will get 9 x 10 = 90 skies in total. So, each person will get 90 skies divided by 2 = 45 skies.
"Response:  If Paige helped her mom with 10 flowers and each flower has 4 petals (or ""saade"" in Afrikaans), then they have planted 40 petals in total. Since there are 45 budding sites, they have planted 40/45 = 0.89 or approximately 9 petals per site. So, they have planted 9 x 45 = 405 petals in total."
Response:  If they have planted 45 seeds and there are 9 blooming stages, then each stage has how many seeds? We can divide the total number of seeds (45) by the number of stages (9) to find out. So, each stage has 5 seeds.
"Response:  If Paige helped her mom with 36 plants and they put 12 seeds in each pot, then the total number of seeds used is:
36 x 12 = 432 seeds
Now, if 58 seedlings grew in every flower bed, then the total number of seedlings grown is:
432 / 58 = 7.5
So, Paige and her mom had 7.5 blombeddings (or blooms)."
"Response:  If Paige helped her mom with 55 plants and they put 15 seeds in each pot, then the total number of seeds is:

55 x 15 = 825 seeds
Now, if 60% of these seeds grew into flowers, we can calculate it as follows:

825 x 60% = 490 flowers
Therefore, Paige and her mom have 490 flowers growing in their garden."
"Response:  If they had helped their mother with 10 flowers each and they had planted 60 flowers in total, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many flowers each person helped to plant.

Person 1 helped with 10 flowers x 5 people = 50 flowers
Person 2 helped with 10 flowers x 4 people = 40 flowers
Person 3 helped with 10 flowers x 3 people = 30 flowers
Total number of flowers helped to plant = 50 + 40 + 30 = 120 flowers

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flower beds they had.
Since they had planted 60 flowers in total, and each flower bed contains 10 flowers, then...
Number of flower beds = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per bed = 60 / 10 = 6 flower beds

So, if they had helped their mother with 10 flowers each and they had planted 60 flowers in total, then they had 6 flower beds."
"Response:  If Paige helped her mom to plant 8 flower beds with 32 flowers each, then the total number of flowers that they planted is:

8 x 32 = 256

So, Paige and her mom planted 256 flowers in total."
Response:  If Matthew had 2 crackers and gave one to each of his 11 friends, then he would have given away 2 x 11 = 22 crackers in total. So, Matthew had 2 - 22 = -19 crackers left for himself.
Response:  If Matthew gave 8 crackers to each of his friends, and he has given crackers to 5 friends in total, then we can calculate the number of crackers he has given as follows: Number of crackers = Total number of friends x Number of crackers per friend = 5 x 8 = 40 crackers. Therefore, Matthew has given 40 crackers to his friends.
Response:  Matthew had 15 cookies and shared them equally among his 5 friends. So each friend got an equal number of cookies, which is 3 cookies per friend (15 / 5 = 3). Now let's find out how many crackers each friend ate. If there were initially 10 crackers over the group of 6 people (Matthew included), then each person ate an average of 10/6 = 1.67 crackers (since Matthew did not eat any crackers). Therefore, each of Matthew's 5 friends ate 3 + 1.67 = 4.67 crackers in total.
Response:  According to the question, Matthew had 24 cookies and gave some of them away as follows: he gave 3 cookies each to his 3 friends, so he gave in total 3 x 3 = 9 cookies away. Now we have to find out how many crackers Matthew has left after giving these away. So, the number of crackers Matthew has left is equal to the original amount of crackers he had (24) minus the number of crackers he gave away (9). Therefore, the answer is: 24 - 9 = 15 crackers.
Response:  According to the question, Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cookies shared among his 11 friends. To find out how many crackers each friend got, we can divide the total number of crackers (22) by the number of friends (11): Each friend got an average of 2 crackers (2/11 = 0.18).
"Response:  Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cookies. If he shared them equally among his two friends, then each friend would have gotten:

Cookies: 30 / 2 = 15 cookies per friend
Crackers: 29 / 2 = 14 crackers per friend
Therefore, the number of cookies each friend ate is 15, and the number of crackers each friend ate is 14."
"Response:  Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cookies. If he shared them equally among his 7 friends, each friend would have received:

Crackers: 14 / 7 = 2 per person
Cookies: 21 / 7 = 3 per person
Therefore, each of Matthew's 7 friends had eaten 2 crackers and 3 cookies in total."
Response:  If Matthew had 36 crackers and shared them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would have received 2 crackers (36/18 = 2). So, each person ate 2 crackers.
"Response:  If Matthew had 6 crackers for each of his friends and he gave away 36 crackers in total, then we can calculate how many friends he had as follows:

Number of crackers = Total number of crackers given away / Number of crackers per friend
= 36 / 6
= 6

Therefore, Matthew had 6 friends."
Response:  Matthew had 23 crackers and gave 11 to his two friends. So, each friend got 5 crackers (11 / 2 = 5).
Response:  Matthew had 31 crackers and gave 23 to his five friends. So he has 9 crackers left (31 - 23 = 9).
"Response:  If Matthew had 32 crackers and 98 cookies to share among his 4 friends, then each friend would get an equal number of crackers and cookies. So, if he gave 16 crackers (half of 32) and 49 cookies (half of 98) to each friend, then the distribution would be:
Friend 1: 16 crackers + 49 cookies = 65 total
Friend 2: 16 crackers + 49 cookies = 65 total
Friend 3: 16 crackers + 49 cookies = 65 total
Friend 4: 16 crackers + 49 cookies = 65 total
Therefore, each friend got 65 crackers and cookies in total."
Response:  If Matthew had 10 cookies and 4 friends, each friend would have received 2.5 cookies (10 / 4 = 2.5). Now, if he gave his friends crackers as well, let's assume that each friend got 3 crackers (a rough estimate since we don't know the exact number of crackers given). So, in total, each friend consumed 2.5 + 3 = 5.5 crackers.
"Response:  If Matthew had initially 13 crackers and 15 cookies to share among his 28 friends, then each friend would have received:

Crackers: 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 4-5 crackers per person)
Cookies: 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 5-6 cookies per person)"
Response:  If Debbie bought x bottles of water and drank them for 74 days, then she must have drunk a total of x x 74 = 74x bottles of water during that time period. Since she bought 2 bottles at a time (as stated in the problem), we can conclude that she bought a total of 2 x 74 = 148 bottles of water. Therefore, the number of bottles Debbie bought is 148.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 153 water bottles and drank them every day for 17 days, then she must have drunk 

$$ \text {Total number of bottles drunk} = \text{Number of bottles per day} \times \text{Number of days} $$

So, we can write:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of bottles drunk}} = \boxed{\text{153}} \times \boxed{\text{17}} = \boxed{\text{2495}} $$
Therefore, Debbie drunk $2495$ water bottles during those 17 days."
"Response:  If she bought 264 water bottles and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left like this:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles bought x Number of days used
= 264 x 11
= 2910

So, Debbie still has 2910 water bottles left."
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 water bottles and drank 144 bottles per day for several days. So, she drank a total of 301 x 144 = 42,960 bottles. Therefore, it took her approximately 157 / 42,960 = 3.6 days to drink all the bottles.
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 water bottles and drank 4 of them per day, she would have drunk 88/4 = 21 days worth of water. Similarly, if she drank 87 sodas per day and had 13 sodas left when she reached the store, then she must have bought those 13 sodas at some point during her 21 days of drinking water. So, the total number of days that Debbie spent buying and drinking both water and soda is 21 + 13 = 34 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 water bottles and drank 312 water bottles in total, that means she did not drink all of them at once. So let's assume she drank an average of 8 water bottles per day (since she had 200 bottles). Now, if she also drank 4 soda bottles per day, that would be equal to 4/8 = 0.5 days worth of soda bottles. Therefore, Debbie would have consumed approximately 0.5 x 256 = 128 soda bottles over the entire period.
Response:  If Debbie bought 12 water bottles and drank 6 of them, that means she has drunk 6/12 = 1/2 of the total amount of water. So, if we assume that each water bottle costs R10, then the total cost of the water Debbie drunk is 1/2 x R10 = R5.
Response:  If Debbie drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles per day, that means she drank a total of 69 bottles (15 x 4 = 60 + 54) per day. Since she had 95 soda bottles and 180 water bottles initially, we can calculate how many days it would take her to finish them using simple division: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption  Number of days = 95 / 69 = 137 days Therefore, if Debbie drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles per day, it would take her approximately 137 days to finish all of the bottles she had initially.
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 soda bottles and drank 122 of them per day, that means she has 238 soda bottles left (360 - 122 = 238). Since she also drank 162 water bottles per day, we can calculate how many days it would take her to finish all the soda bottles as follows: Number of soda bottles / Number of drinks per day = Days to finish all soda bottles 238 soda bottles / 122 drinks per day = 195 days Therefore, if Debbie continues to drink at this rate, it will take her approximately 195 days to finish all the remaining soda bottles.
Response:  If Faye has placed her potatoes in 14 rows with 11 potatoes in each row, then she has a total of... (calculate)
Response:  If Faye has 12 potted geraniums and she places them in 3 rows, then each row will have how many plants? We can divide the total number of plants (12) by the number of rows (3) to get the answer: 12 / 3 = 4. So, Faye placed 4 potatoes in each row.
"Response:  We know that Faye had 28 potatoes and she placed them in rows of 16 each. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of rows = Total number of potatoes / Number of potatoes per row

In this case, the total number of potatoes is 28, and the number of potatoes per row is 16 (since there are 16 potatoes in each row). Therefore, we can solve for the number of rows as follows:

Number of rows = 28 / 16 = 4

So, Faye could make 4 rows of potatoes."
"Response:  We know that Faye had 6 packs of potatoes and each pack contains 14 potatoes. So, the total number of potatoes Faye has is:

6 packs x 14 potatoes/pack = 84 potatoes

Therefore, the answer is 84 potatoes."
Response:  If Faye had 35 potatoes and 7 colorful potatoes, that means she had a total of 42 potatoes (35 + 7). Since each row has 5 potatoes, Faye could make 8 rows (42 / 5 = 8) of potato plants.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pots and crocks in 19 rows with 4 pots and 27 crocks in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of pots as follows: Total number of pots = Number of rows x Number of pots per row = 19 x 4 = 76 pots. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of crocks as follows: Total number of crocks = Number of rows x Number of crocks per row = 19 x 27 = 503 crocks. Therefore, Faye has 76 pots and 503 crocks in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 rows of potatoes and 36 potatoes in each row. Therefore, she has a total of 7 x 36 = 252 potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many crystals Faye has. According to the question, she has 30 crystals in every row, so she has a total of 30 x 7 = 210 crystals. So, the final answer is 252 + 210 = 462 crystals.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pots and chairs in 11 rows with 31 pots and 27 chairs in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pots as follows: Total number of pots = Number of rows x Number of pots per row = 11 x 31 = 341 pots. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows: Total number of chairs = Number of rows x Number of chairs per row = 11 x 27 = 307 chairs. So, Faye has a total of 341 pots and 307 chairs.
Response:  If Faye has placed 30 pots of rice in each row and there are 5 pots in every row, then the total number of rows is 30/5 = 6. So, Faye can make 6 rows of rice.
Response:  If Faye had 6 potatoes and placed them in two rows of equal length, then she would have placed 3 potatoes in each row. Therefore, the number of potatoes Faye placed in each row is 3.
Response:  Since Faye had 35 potatoes and she placed 2 potatoes in each row, then the number of rows is 35/2 = 17. So, Faye could make 17 rows of potatoes.
Response:  If Faye had 31 packs of potato chips and each pack contained 6 chips, then she would have had a total of 31 x 6 = 186 chips. Since she placed them in rows with 19 chips in each row, the total number of chips she had is 186 / 19 = 9.74 chips per row.
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 rows of potatoes and 71 potatoes in each row. Therefore, she has a total of 30 x 71 = 2130 potatoes.
Response:  We know that Faye has 16 rows of potatoes and 6 potatoes in each row. Therefore, she has 16 x 6 = 96 potatoes in total. Now, we need to find out how many croissants she has. According to the question, Faye has 21 potatoes in every row, so she has 21 x 6 = 126 croissants in total.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students attending it. Since each classroom has 30 students on average (which may not always be accurate), we can assume that there will be approximately 21 x 30 = 630 students in total at the school. Now, since there are 7 school buses available, we need to divide the number of students by 7 to find out how many seats are available per bus. Therefore, the number of seat places in each bus is 630 / 7 = 90. So, there are 90 seat places in each of the 7 school buses.
Response:  The school has 84 classrooms and 95 school buses that are fully occupied with 118 seats per bus. To find out how many students there are in the school, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the number of buses and then divide it by the number of seats per bus. So, we have: Number of students = Number of classrooms x Number of buses / Number of seats per bus = 84 x 95 / 118 = 760 students Therefore, there are approximately 760 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 66 learners per classroom and 6 seats per school bus. Therefore, we need to divide the number of learners by the number of seats available on each bus to determine how many buses will be needed for the trip. So, 66 learners / 6 seats = 11 buses (round up to the nearest whole number). Thus, 11 school buses will be required to transport all the learners for the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms and 58 learners in each classroom, so we have:
Number of classrooms = 87
Number of learners per classroom = 58
Now, let's find out how many school buses will be needed to transport all the learners for the field trip. Since there are 2 seats available on each bus, we can calculate the number of buses required as follows:
Number of buses required = Number of learners / Number of seats per bus
= 58 x 2 (since there are 2 seats available on each bus)
= 116 buses
Therefore, 116 school buses will be needed to transport all the learners for the field trip."
Response:  The school has 24 classrooms and 120 students in total. Since each classroom has the same number of students, there are 5 students per classroom (120/24). Now, we need to find out how many students are in each bus seat. There are 84 seatbelts in each school bus, so the number of students per seatbelt is also 5 (84/16). Therefore, there are 5 students for every seatbelt in the school bus.
"Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms at the school and 102 students attending it. Since 8 seats are available per bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to determine how many buses are needed for the trip. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of buses required = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus
= 102 students / 8 seats/bus
= 13 buses
Therefore, 13 buses are needed to transport all the students for the field trip."
Response:  The school has 102 classrooms and there are 11 students in total at the school. If we assume that all 11 students will go on the field trip, then each bus can accommodate an average of 99 students (i.e., 99 / 11 = x). Since 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, this means that x - 8 = number of students who will actually go on the field trip. Therefore, the answer is x = 34.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms at the school and each classroom has 3 seats per bus. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students (111) by the number of seats available on each bus (3). So, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:

Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus
= 111 / 3
= 37
Therefore, 37 buses will be required for the field trip."
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms at school and 46 school buses. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of seats = Total number of students / Number of buses. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of seats = 92 students / 46 buses = 2 seats per bus. So, there are 2 sitpleks (or two seats) available in each bus.
"Response:  If there are 11 boys in class 11 and each boy gets 9 knuckle bones as a gift from Hayley, then the total number of knuckle bones given away by Hayley is:

11 boys x 9 knuckle bones per boy = 99 knuckle bones
Therefore, Hayley gave away 99 knuckle bones to the boys in Class 11."
"Response:  If Haley has 10 knick-knacks and she gave 5 to each of the 3 boys, then...

Step 1: How many knick-knacks did Haley give in total?
Total number of knick-knacks given by Haley = Number of knick-knacks Haley had x Number of people to whom she gave knick-knacks
= 10 x 3
= 30

So, Haley gave away 30 knick-knacks in total."
Response:  If there are 4 boys who want to keep their marbles and Haley has 23 marbles in total, then each boy will get 6 marbles (23 / 4 = 6). So, each of the 4 boys will receive 6 marbles from Haley.
"Response:  If there are 13 boys playing with knick-knacks and each of them has 50 knuckle bones, then the total number of knuckle bones they have is:

13 x 50 = 650

So, each boy will get 650 knuckle bones."
"Response:  If Haley has 20 pencils and she shares them equally among her classmates in the second grade, then each of those classmates will get x number of pencils. We can represent this as:
x = 20 / n
where n is the total number of classmates (i.e., the second graders).
Now we are given that there are 15 students in the second grade. So, if we substitute this value for n into the equation above, we get:
x = 20 / 15
x = 13
Therefore, each of the 15 second-grade classmates will receive 13 pencils from Haley."
Response:  If Haley gave 2 knickers to each of the 10 boys, then she gave a total of 2 x 10 = 20 knickers away. So, the number of boys who received knickers from Haley is 20 / 2 = 10 boys.
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 392 pages and he reads 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading pages Therefore, Number of days = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Frank took 27 days to finish reading the book.
"Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of pages = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to finish reading the book

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of pages = 3000 pages / 569 days

Therefore, there are approximately 5.4 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank read the entire book in 6 days and it had 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. Therefore, he read 612/24 = 25 pages per chapter. Now, we need to find out how many chapters Frank read per day. So, let's divide the number of pages he read by the time he spent reading: 25 pages / 6 days = 4.17 pages per day (round up to 4 pages per day).
"Response:  We know that there are 5 chapters and each chapter has 110 pages (according to Frank). Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:
Chapter 1 = 110 pages
Chapter 2 = 110 pages
...
Chapter 5 = 110 pages
Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter:
Chapter 1 = 110 pages
Chapter 2 = 110 pages
...
Chapter 5 = 110 pages
So, there are 110 pages in each chapter."
Response:  We know that Frank read the entire book in 193 pages and it had 15 chapters. Therefore, each chapter had approximately 13 pages (193 / 15 = 13). Now, we need to find out how many days Frank took to read one chapter. To do this, divide the number of pages in a chapter by the number of days he spent reading. In this case, 660 days / 13 pages per chapter = 50 days per chapter. So, Frank read 50 days x 15 chapters = 750 days to complete the book.
Response:  We know that Frank has read two books and each book had 249 pages. Therefore, he has spent 3 days reading each book, which means he has spent in total 6 days reading both books. Now we want to find out how many pages Frank has read per day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages (249 x 2 = 498) by the number of days he took to read them (6). So, Frank has read approximately 86 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank has read some books and each book had 66 pages. Therefore, if he took 12 days to complete each book, then he must have taken a total of:

12 days/book x number of books = total time taken

We are also given that Frank took 492 days to complete all the books. So, we can set up an equation as follows:

Total time taken = Number of books x Time taken per book

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total time taken = 492 days x?

Solving for?, we get:

Number of books = Total time taken / (Time taken per book)

Substituting the value of 492 days, we get:

Number of books = 492 days / 12 days/book = 40 books

Therefore, Frank has read 40 books."
"Response:  According to the question, Frank read the book in 16 days and it had 112 pages. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read the book
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of the book every day for 16 days."
"Response:  If he read 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, then it will take him:

576 / 8 = 72 days to finish reading the book."
Response:  The book had 41 chapters with each chapter having 450 pages, so in total there were 41 x 450 = 17650 pages in the book. Now, we are asked how many days it took Frank to read the entire book. Since he read 30 days, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read the book = 17650 pages / 30 days = 585 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that there are three chapters with 594 pages each, and Frank took 607 days to complete the book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Chapter 1 = 594 pages
Chapter 2 = 594 pages
Chapter 3 =? pages

We want to find out how many pages are in Chapter 3, so let's substitute the value of 607 days into the equation:

Chapter 3 = 594 pages x (607 days / 3 chapters) = 594 pages x 235 days = 148,960 pages

Therefore, there are 148,960 pages in each chapter."
Response:  We know that Frank read the entire book in 664 days and it had two chapters with 405 pages each. Therefore, he read one chapter every 332 days (664 / 2 = 332). So, he read approximately 1 chapter per day.
"Response:  If we buy 6 DVDs for $120, then each DVD costs:
$120 / 6 = $20 per DVD
Therefore, each Pakkie (DVD) costs $20."
Response:  Elke pakkie contains $81 worth of groceries, so if we buy 33 packages of DVDs, that means we are buying $81 x 33 = $2690 worth of DVDs.
"Response:  If each DVD costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 off every package, then we can calculate how many packages you can buy with $93 as follows:

$107 - $106 = $1 (the cost of one DVD)
$93 / $1 = 93 packages (you can buy with $93)
Therefore, you can buy 93 packages of DVDs with $93."
Response:  The cost of each DVD is $76 and there is a discount of $25 for every package. To find out how much you need to pay for each package, we can use the following formula: Cost = (Number of DVDs x Cost per DVD) - Discount. In this case, the number of DVDs in each package is not given, so we will assume that there are 3 DVDs in each package. Therefore, the total cost of each package would be: Cost = ($76 x 3) - $25 = $106. So, you would need to pay $106 for each package.
"Response:  If Jy has $104 dollars to spend and each DVD costs $26, then we can calculate how many DVDs Jy can buy like this:
$104 / $26 = 4
So Jy can buy 4 DVDs with their $104 budget."
Response:  If you can buy 2 DVDs for $28, that means each DVD costs $14.
Response:  There are 18 songs in Philip's song collection. If we organize them into groups of size 2, then... We can create how many groups?...Therefore, there will be... (Do not forget to explain your reasoning.)
"Response:  According to the question, there are several songs in Philip's song collection. The songs are organized into groups of size 187. To find out how many songs Philip has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of songs in all the groups. So, the answer is: 

Total number of songs = Number of groups x Total number of songs per group
= 140 x?

We don't know the exact value of? yet, but we can try to estimate it based on the information provided in the question. Since there are 140 groups, and each group contains an unknown number of songs (which we will call x), we can write the equation:

Total number of songs = 140x
Now, let's solve for x:

x = Total number of songs / 140
Substituting the given values, we get:

x =? / 140
Since we want to find out how many songs Philip has in his collection, we will use the fact that the total number of songs is equal to the product of the number of groups and the average number of songs per group. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

Number of songs = Group size x Average number of songs per group
In this case, the group size is 187, and we want to find out the average number of songs per group. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine this value exactly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the context of the problem. For example, if Philip's song collection consists mainly of popular songs, then he may have more songs than if his collection consisted mainly of obscure or classical music. Therefore, we could assume that the average number of songs per group is around 5-10, which would give us a rough estimate of the total number of songs in Philip's collection. Using these numbers, we can plug them back into the original equation:

Number of songs = 140 x 5-10
This gives us a range of possible answers, from approximately 700 songs to over 14,000 songs. Of course, these estimates are highly uncertain and depend heavily on our assumptions about the nature of Philip's song collection. In reality, the actual number of songs in"
Response:  We know that there are 203 pigeons and 63 lemons in Philip's collection. Since the pigeons are organized into groups of 7, we can say that the number of pigeons in each group is 203 / 7 = 28. Similarly, since the lemons are organized into groups of 95, we can say that the number of lemons in each group is 63 / 95 = 0.66. Therefore, each group of pigeons has approximately 28 pigeons, and each group of lemons has approximately 0.66 lemons.
Response:  We know that there are 142 pigeons and 356 lemons in Philip's collection. If we organize the pigeons into groups of 47 each, then we will have 47 groups of pigeons. Similarly, if we organize the lemons into groups of 178 each, then we will have 178 groups of lemons. So, the size of each group of lemons is 178.
Response:  We know that there are 392 piesangs in Philip's song collection and that these piesangs are organized into groups of 196 each. Therefore, we can calculate the size of each group as follows: Number of piesangs per group = Total number of piesangs / Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2. So, each group contains 2 piesangs.
Response:  We know that there are 18 groups of sizes in Philip's pie-sing collection. Since each group consists of 18 piesangs, we can write this as: 18 x 18 = 324 piesangs in total. Therefore, there are 324/18 = 18 groups of piesangs in Philip's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 87 lemons and 290 pears in Philip's collection. Since the pears are organized into two groups, we can assume that each group contains half of the total number of pears, which means that one group has 145 pears (half of 290). Similarly, since the lemons are organized into 93 groups, each group must contain half of the total number of lemons, which means that one group has 43 lemons (half of 87). Therefore, Group A has 145 pears and 43 lemons, while Group B has 43 pears and 43 lemons.
"Response:  We know that there are 384 lemons and 192 pineapples in Philip's collection. Since the pineapples are organized into 345 groups, we can assume that each group contains an equal number of pineapples. Therefore, the size of each group is:

Number of pineapples per group = Total number of pineapples / Number of groups
= 192 / 345
= 0.55 (or approximately 1/2)

Now, let's find out how many lemons are in each group of pineapples. Since there are 16 groups of lemons, we can calculate their size as follows:

Number of lemons per group = Total number of lemons / Number of groups
= 384 / 16
= 24 (or approximately 24/1)

So, there are 24 lemons in each group of pineapples."
Response:  If Brenda made 38 cookies and each guest had 19 cookies, then the number of guests that Brenda served can be calculated as follows: Number of guests = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per guest = 38 / 19 = 2. Therefore, Brenda served 2 guests with her homemade cookies.
"Response:  If Brenda made 14 cookies and each of her friends had 30 cookies, then we can calculate how many cookies Brenda prepared as follows:

Brenda prepared x cookies for her friends.
Since each friend got 30 cookies, Brenda gave out a total of 30x cookies.
So, the value of x is 30. Therefore, Brenda prepared 30 cookies for her friends."
Response:  If Brenda made 5 cookies and threw away 17, then she must have had 22 cookies in total (5 + 17 = 22). So each person had 4 cookies (22 / 5 = 4).
"Response:  If Brenda made 18 cookies and each guest had an equal number of cookies as the total number of guests (9), then we can calculate how many cookies each guest received as follows:
Number of cookies per guest = Total number of cookies / Number of guests
= 18 / 9
= 2
So each guest received 2 cookies from Brenda."
Response:  If Brenda gave 14 cookies to 2 guests and each guest had the same number of cookies as Brenda, then we can conclude that... (1) The total number of cookies given to the 2 guests is equal to the number of cookies Brenda gave them. Therefore, if B = number of cookies Brenda gave, then... (2) B × 2 = 14 (since there are 2 guests). Solving for B in equation (2), we get... (3) B = 7 (cookies per guest). So, each guest received 7 cookies from Brenda.
Response:  If Brenda made cookies for guests and each guest had 2 cookies, then she prepared a total of 10 cookies for how many guests? So, the answer is 5 guests (10 cookies / 2 cookies per guest = 5 guests).
Response:  If Frank had 42 pieces of nice goods and he put them into two bags, then there must be 42/2 = 21 pieces of nice goods in each bag.
Response:  If Frank had 26 bags of candy with 33 pieces in each bag, then he would have total number of candies = 26 x 33 = 840 pieces of candy. So, Frank had 840 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Frank had 33 pieces of nice goods and lost 24 of them, he would have 9 remaining pieces. To find out how many bags he has, we need to divide the number of remaining pieces by the number of pieces in each bag. So, if he has 9 pieces in each bag, he would have 9 / 9 = 1 bag. Therefore, Frank has one bag with 9 nice goods inside.
Response:  If Frank had 11 pieces of nice goods in each bag and he had 22 pieces of nice goods altogether, then we can calculate how many bags he must have had as follows: Number of bags = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per bag So, if he had 22 pieces of nice goods altogether and he had 11 pieces of nice goods in each bag, then the total number of pieces is 22 x 11 = 242 pieces. Therefore, Frank must have had 242/11 = 22 bags.
Response:  If Frank had 16 pieces of candy and he put them into two bags, then there must be an equal number of candies in each bag. So if there are x candies in one bag, there will also be x candies in the other bag. Since Frank had 16 candies in total, we can write the equation: x + x = 16. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 pieces of candy in each bag.
"Response:  If Shirley has sold 25 boxes of three-hole punch and each box contains 14 holes, then we need to calculate how many holes she needs to punch in total. So, the number of holes that Shirley needs to punch is:

25 boxes x 14 holes/box = 350 holes
Therefore, Shirley needs to punch 350 holes in total."
Response:  If Shirley has sold 10 boxes of chocolates and she needs to pack 5 boxes per bag, then we need to divide 10 by 5 to find out how many bags she can make. So, there are 2 bags (10 / 5 = 2).
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 67 + 9 = 76 bottles. Now we need to find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda they had. So, we can write an equation like this: Number of bottles of regular soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of diet soda. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of bottles of regular soda = 76 - 9 = 67 bottles. Therefore, they had 67 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of both types of soda is 83 (22 + 61). Now we need to find out how many more bottles of diet soda they had than regular soda. So, let's divide the number of bottles of diet soda (61) by the total number of bottles (83):

Number of bottles of diet soda / Total number of bottles = 61/83 = 0.74

So, they had 74% more bottles of diet soda than regular soda."
Response:  According to the question, they had 30 regular sodas and 8 diet sodas, so together that is 38 bottles of soda (30 + 8 = 38). Additionally, they had 41 apples. So, in total, they had 38 bottles of soda plus 41 apples, which equals 79 items (38 + 41 = 79).
"Response:  We know that they had 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in total. So we can write this as an equation:

Total number of bottles = Number of regular soda bottles + Number of diet soda bottles

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of bottles = 79 + 53

Simplifying, we have:

Total number of bottles = 132

So, they had more than twice as many bottles of regular soda as they did of diet soda (i.e., 79 - 53 = 26)."
"Response:  According to the question, they had 83 bottles of regular soda and 12 apples. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda they had than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of regular soda. So, the difference between the two is:

83 - 54 = 29

Therefore, they had 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
Response:  We know that they had 17 bottles of cold drinks in total and 9 were regular colddrink. So, we can say that they had 8 bottles of diet colddrink (17 - 9 = 8).
"Response:  According to the question, they had 19 liters of cold drinks and 60 bottles of regular cola. We need to find out how many more bottles of regular cola they had than diet cola. So we can do this by subtracting the number of bottles of diet cola from the total number of bottles of cola:

Number of bottles of regular cola = Total number of bottles of cola - Number of bottles of diet cola
= 60 - x

Where x is the number of bottles of diet cola. Since they had 19 liters of cold drinks, we know that x / 19 = y, where y is the number of bottles of regular cola. Therefore, we have:

x/19 = y

Now we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 19:

x = 19y

So, they had 38 more bottles of regular cola than diet cola (38 = 19y)."
Response:  The total number of bottles is 72 (gewone soda) + 32 (dieet soda) = 104 bottles. Now we know that they had more bottles than apples. So, the difference between the total number of bottles and the number of apples is equal to the number of extra bottles they had. Therefore, the number of extra bottles is 104 - 78 = 26 bottles.
"Response:  The shop had 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles they had than apples, we need to subtract the number of apples from the number of bottles:

Number of bottles - Number of apples = More bottles
= 80 - 36 = 44

So, the shop had 44 more bottles than apples."
Response:  We know that they had 30 bottles of cola in total and 28 were regular cold drinks. So, we can say that the number of diet sodas they had is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, they had 2 bottles of diet soda.
Response:  The person had 4 diet sodas at the store and they had 79 more bottles of regular soda. So, in total, they had 83 bottles of soda (4 + 79 = 83).
"Response:  According to the question, they had 57 regular sodas, which is equal to 26 diet sodas and 27 light sodas. So, we can write this as an equation:

57 + 26 = x
x + 27 = y

Now we need to solve for x and y. We know that x represents the number of regular sodas and y represents the total number of bottles. Therefore, we can substitute the values given in the question into these equations:

57 + 26 = x
x + 27 = y

Solving for x, we get:

x = 83

And solving for y, we get:

y = 104

Therefore, the answer to the question is: They had 83 bottles of regular soda and 104 bottles in total (including both regular and diet sodas)."
"Response:  We know that they had 81 bottles of regular soda in total. They had 60 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of light soda. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Total number of bottles of regular soda = 81
Number of bottles of diet soda = 60
Number of bottles of light soda = 60

Now, let's solve for the number of bottles of regular soda:

Number of bottles of regular soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of diet soda - Number of bottles of light soda
= 81 - 60 - 60
= 41

So, they had 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
Response:  We know that in total they had 49 bottles of soda and we also know how many bottles each type of soda they had: 40 bottles of regular soda, 6 bottles of diet soda, and 3 bottles of light soda. So, to find out how many bottles of regular and diet soda they had together, we can use the following equation: Total number of bottles = Number of regular soda + Number of diet soda. In this case, the total number of bottles is 49, so we can set up the equation as follows: 49 = x + y where x is the number of regular soda bottles and y is the number of diet soda bottles. Now we need to solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the equation for x, we get: x = 40 - y Substituting this value back into the original equation, we get: 49 = 40 - y Now solving for y, we get: y = 9 Therefore, they had 40 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda together.
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is given as 317. To find out how many more visitors there were that day compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the current day's total. So, if there were 295 visitors the previous day, then there are 22 (317 - 295) more visitors that day.
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 246 visitors today, then we can calculate how many people visited the palace in total over the past 25 days as follows:
Total number of visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors today
= 703 + 246
= 949
Therefore, over the past 25 days, approximately 949 people visited Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 666 visitors today, then we can calculate how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace today compared to yesterday as follows:

Total number of visitors = 100 + 666 = 766

So, there are 766 more visitors at Buckingham Palace today than there were yesterday."
"Response:  We know that there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and we want to find out how many visitors came the previous day. To do this, we need to use the information given in the question. The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 327 days is 406. So, if we divide the total number of visitors (406) by the number of days (327), we get the average number of visitors per day: 
Average number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days = 406 / 327 = 1.25
Therefore, approximately 1.25 people visited Buckingham Palace the previous day."
"Response:  We know that there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 829 people who visited the palace in the past 85 days. To find out how many visitors came to the palace that day, we need to divide the number of visitors from the previous day by 85. So, the answer is: 
Number of visitors = Number of visitors from previous day / 85
= 45 / 85
= 0.53 (or approximately 1/2)
Therefore, about half of the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 85 days visited the palace on that particular day."
"Response:  If there were 71 paintings at Buckingham Palace and Rachel found that 557 visitors came to the palace that day, then the number of visitors per day is:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 557 / 1 (since it's the only day considered)
= 557

Now, if there were 188 visitors the previous day, then the total number of visitors over 57 days can be calculated as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days
= 557 x 57
= 32,699

Therefore, the answer to the question is 32,699."
"Response:  We know that there were 39 artists at Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that 661 visitors came to the palace that day. To find out how many more visitors came that day compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of artists from the total number of visitors. So, if there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is:

661 - 39 = 622

Therefore, there were 622 more visitors at Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day."
"Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is given as 92. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors that day before, then we can find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace that day by subtracting the total number of visitors from the previous day and the day before that:

Total visitors = 419 + 103 + 92 = 614

So, there were 614 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day."
"Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is given as 512. To find out how many visitors have visited in the past 89 days, we need to multiply the daily number of visitors by 89. So, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days is:

512 x 89 = 43,648

Therefore, there were 43,648 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days."
"Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is given as follows:

* Yesterday (day before): 191 visitors
* Today (the day of the question): 705 visitors
* Tomorrow (next day):?

We are asked to find out how many more visitors will come to Buckingham Palace tomorrow compared to the previous day. So, we need to subtract the number of visitors yesterday from the number of visitors today:

705 - 191 = 514

Therefore, there will be 514 more visitors at Buckingham Palace tomorrow than there were yesterday."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of all the Vere'en is 628 grams and we need to find out how much more than 159 grams he had. So, let's calculate it as follows:

Total weight of all Vere'en = 628 grams
Additional weight needed = Total weight - 159 grams
= 628 grams - 159 grams
= 469 grams
Therefore, he had 469 grams more than 159 grams."
"Response:  We know that he needed 49 grams of paint to color all four sides of each cube. If he had already used 260 grams of paint and still needed more, then we can calculate how much more he needs as follows:

Total amount of paint needed = Number of cubes x Amount of paint per cube
= 4 x 49 grams
= 196 grams

Therefore, he still needs an additional 74 grams of paint (260 - 196 = 74)."
Response:  We know that he needed 57 grams of color to paint all the tiles and 22 grams of glue. So, in total, he needed 89 grams (57 + 22). Since the total amount of material needed was 353 grams, we can calculate how much he already had by subtracting the amount he used from the total: 353 - 89 = 264 grams. Therefore, he had 264 grams left after using the materials.
Response:  If he needs 166 grams of Vere and he has 20 grams left, then he still needs 146 grams (166 - 20 = 146).
Response:  We know that the total weight of the Vere is 557 grams and we need to find out how many grams are needed for one piece. So, if we divide the total weight by the number of pieces (17), we will get the required weight per piece. Therefore, the amount of Gram needed for each piece is 557/17 = 32.8 grams.
"Response:  If he had 11 grams at first and needed 492 grams in total, then we can calculate how much more he needs as follows:

Total amount = Desired amount - Initial amount
= 492 g - 11 g
= 481 g

Therefore, he still needs 481 grams of the substance to complete his task."
Response:  If it took 94 of the picketers 6 days to collect 90 bags of wheat, then they collected an average of 15 bags (94/6 = 15) per day.
"Response:  If there are 266 pickers and they have to collect 90 bags of fruit in 5 days, we can calculate the number of bags that each picker would need to collect per day as follows:

Number of pickers = 266
Total amount of fruit to be collected = 90 bags
Number of days = 5 days

Now, let's divide the total amount of fruit to be collected by the number of days available for collection:

Number of bags per day = Total amount of fruit / Number of days
= 90 bags / 5 days
= 18 bags per day

Therefore, each picker would need to collect approximately 18 bags of fruit per day."
"Response:  The number of days is given as 146 and the amount of water used per day is 244 liters. Therefore, to find out how many vats of water will be filled in 146 days, we can multiply the number of days by the amount of water used per day:

Number of vats = Number of days x Amount of water used per day
= 146 x 244
= 35,080 vats
Therefore, approximately 35,080 vats of water will be filled in 146 days."
"Response:  The number of days is given as 77 and we are asked how many bags of drupes would be filled in that time period. We know from the problem statement that 100 vates (baskets) of raspberries are picked every day and 221 vates of grapes are picked every day. To find out how many bags of drupes would be filled in 77 days, we need to calculate how many bags of each fruit would be filled during this time period.
Let's assume that one bag of raspberries contains 4 vates (baskets). Therefore, if 100 vates of raspberries are picked every day, then 100 x 4 = 400 bags of raspberries would be filled in 77 days. Similarly, let's assume that one bag of grapes contains 6 vates (baskets). So, if 221 vates of grapes are picked every day, then 221 x 6 = 1326 bags of grapes would be filled in 77 days. Now, since both fruits are being picked simultaneously, we can add up the total number of bags of both fruits to get the overall number of bags of drupes that would be filled in 77 days. Therefore, the final answer is: Total number of bags of drupes = 400 + 1326 = 1726 bags."
"Response:  The number of days is given as 58 and the number of workers is 252. Each worker can produce 108 votes per day. Therefore, we have to calculate how many votes will be filled in 58 days. To do this, we need to multiply the number of workers with the number of days: 
Votes = Number of Workers x Number of Days
= 252 x 58
= 14640 votes
Therefore, approximately 14640 votes will be filled in 58 days."
"Response:  If they have saved 36 workers from doing overtime and each worker can produce 8 units of drywall per day, then we need to calculate how many days it will take for them to produce 240 units of drywall.
To do this, we divide the total number of units (240) by the number of units produced per day (8):
Days = Total Units / Number of Units Produced Per Day
= 240 / 8
= 30 days
Therefore, it will take them 30 days to produce 240 units of drywall if they save 36 workers from doing overtime."
"Response:  If each aquarium had 52 sea creatures in total and there were 26 aquariums, then the number of sea creatures in each aquarium is:

Number of sea creatures per aquarium = Total number of sea creatures / Number of aquariums
= 52 / 26
= 2

So, each aquarium had 2 sea creatures."
"Response:  If he had 40 aquatic animals in different aquariums and each aquarium has 2 animals, then...

1. He had 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums."
Response:  We know that Tyler had 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium contains 39 animals. So, to find out how many saltwater animals Tyler has, we can use the following equation: Number of saltwater animals = Total number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Saltwater animals = 56 x 39 = 2174 Freshwater animals = 10 x 39 = 390 Therefore, Tyler has 2174 saltwater animals and 390 freshwater animals.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for freshwater fish and 22 aquariums for saltwater fish. Each aquarium contains 46 fish in it. So, to find out how many saltwater fish Tyler had, we can use the following calculation: Total number of fish = Number of freshwater fish x Number of aquariums + Number of saltwater fish x Number of aquariums. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of fish = 74 x 46 + 22 x 46 = 3180 + 952 = 4132 fish. Therefore, Tyler had 4132 saltwater fish.
Response:  If he had 15 aquariums for freshwater fish and 62 aquariums for saltwater fish, then the total number of aquariums is 15 + 62 = 77. Since each aquarium has 19 fish, the total number of fish he had is 77 x 19 = 1433. Therefore, he had 1433 fish in total.
Response:  If you buy 39 white T-shirts and each pack contains 13 shirts, then... (calculate)...you will have 39 / 13 = 3 packs of T-shirts.
"Response:  If they can buy 66 white T-shirts with each package containing 3 white T-shirts, then how many packages will they have?

Response:  If we buy 28 packs of themed stickers that contain 56 white stickers altogether, then there are 56 / 28 = 2 white stickers in each pack.
Response:  We know that 57 packs of white T-shirts were bought and 34 broke them down into smaller packages. So, we need to find out how many white T-shirts are in each package. If there are 53 white T-shirts in one package, then the number of packages = total number of white T-shirts / number of white T-shirts in each package. Therefore, the number of white T-shirts = (57 x 53) / 34 = 1690 white T-shirts.
Response:  If she bought 51 pairs of socks with themed designs, and each pair contains three socks, then... (calculate)
Response:  If you bought 70 pairs of socks and each pair contains 5 socks, then the total number of socks you have is 70 x 5 = 350 socks. Since you asked how many white socks are there in each pack of 14 socks, we can divide the total number of socks (350) by 14 to get the answer. Therefore, there are 26 socks (350 / 14) that are white in each pack.
Response:  We have 12 sacks with an equal number of cookies in each sack (let's call it x). So we have 12x cookies in total. Now, there are 36 cookies in total. Therefore, the number of cookies per sack is: 36 / 12 = 3.
Response:  If you have 33 cookies and each bag contains 11 cookies, then how many bags of cookies do you have? Therefore, the answer is 33 / 11 = 3 bags of cookies.
Response:  Elke sak has 41 cookies and you have 53 bags of cookies. So, we need to find out how many cookies are in each bag. If there are 41 cookies in each sack, then there will be 53 / 41 = 1.29 (approximately) bags of cookies in each bag. Therefore, I have approximately 1.29 x 53 = 67.71 cookies.
Response:  We have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags with the same number of cookies. So, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags. Therefore, each bag has 14/7 = 2 cookies.
Response:  Elke sak has 3 cookies and you have 21 total cookies. So, if we divide the number of cookies you have (21) by the number of cookies per sack (3), we get... 21 / 3 = 7 sacks!
Response:  If you have had 26 sacks with the same number of cookies and you have 15 good ones, then you must have had 11 sacks without any cookies (since 26 - 15 = 11). Therefore, you have 11 sacks of cookies.
Response:  If you have had 14 bags of cookies with an equal number of cookies each time (which is assumed), then you must have eaten 14/2 = 7 bags of cookies altogether. Since there are 28 cookies per bag, you have eaten 7 x 28 = 196 cookies in total. Now, if you also have 86 pieces of candy, that means you still have 86 - 196 = 50 pieces of candy left. So, you have 50 pieces of candy remaining after eating all those cookies.
"Response:  If Posman gives 5 pieces of rubbish to each block and there are 25 houses in each block, then the total number of houses in all blocks is:

Number of houses = Number of blocks x Number of houses per block
= 10 x 25
= 250 houses
Therefore, there are 250 houses in all the blocks combined."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and Posman needs to give 9 packages of rubbish to each house, then he will need to give a total of 180 packages of rubbish (20 x 9 = 180).
Response:  There are 6 houses on the block. The postman has to deliver 24 pieces of junk mail to each house. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the postman needs to deliver is 6 x 24 = 144 pieces.
"Response:  The postman has to deliver 14 packages per block and each block contains how many houses? So, we need to find out the number of houses in one block first. Let's assume that there are x houses in one block. Then, the total number of blocks is given by:

Number of blocks = Total number of houses / Number of houses per block
= 14 packages/block x x houses/block
= x

So, there are x houses in one block. Since the postman has to deliver 2 pieces of trash to every block, the total number of pieces of trash he needs to deliver is:

Total number of pieces of trash = Number of blocks x 2 pieces/block
= x x 2
= 2x

Therefore, there are 2x pieces of trash in total."
Response:  There are 20 houses in each block. The postman has to deliver 32 pieces of trash to every house in every block. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash that the postman needs to deliver per block = Total number of houses in the block x Number of pieces of trash to be delivered to each house. So, the answer is 640 (20 houses x 32 pieces/house).
"Response:  Since there are 78 blocks and each block has 19 houses, we need to calculate how many pieces of puzzle Posman needs to give to each house. So, the total number of pieces of puzzle that Posman needs to give is:

78 blocks x 19 houses/block = 1562 pieces of puzzle
Therefore, Posman needs to give 1562 pieces of puzzle to each of the 78 blocks."
"Response:  The number of houses that Posman must give room to is equal to the total number of blocks multiplied by the number of rooms he has to give per block. Therefore, we can write:
Houses = Blocks x Rooms/Block
We know that there are 55 blocks and Posman has to give 8 rooms per block, so we can plug these values into the equation:
Houses = 55 x 8 = 440
Therefore, there are 440 houses in all the blocks combined."
Response:  Since there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses, we have to give 81 x 12 = 972 pieces of junk mail to all the houses in total. Now, since Posman only needs to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail per house, he needs to deliver 972 / 4 = 243 pieces of junk mail per block. So, Posman needs to deliver 243 pieces of junk mail to each of the 81 blocks.
Response:  Since there are 17 houses per block and Posman needs to give 4 pieces of rubbish bags to each house, we need to calculate how many pieces he needs to give overall. So, the total number of pieces of rubbish bags that Posman needs to give = Number of blocks x Number of houses per block x Number of pieces of rubbish bags per house. In this case, the calculation would be: Total number of pieces of rubbish bags = 16 blocks x 17 houses/block x 4 pieces/house = 828 pieces of rubbish bags. Therefore, Posman needs to give 828 pieces of rubbish bags in total.
"Response:  We have to divide 10 eggs and 20 knickers among groups of 4 people each. To do this, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these numbers.

To start, let's divide 10 eggs equally among 4 people:

4 people x 2 eggs per person = 8 eggs

Now, let's see how many groups of 4 people we can make with 20 knickers:

20 knickers / 4 people per group = 5 groups

So, we can form 5 groups of 4 people each, or a total of 20 people."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 knickers and 15 eggs to distribute among 5 groups of 5 people each. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide the total number of items (10 + 15) by 5. So, the answer is 2 groups.
"Response:  If there are 11 groups of eggs and each group has 2 eggs, then the total number of eggs is:

11 x 2 = 22 eggs
So, Rebecca has 22 eggs."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 chicks. She will divide them into 4 groups. So, we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. If she divides them equally, then each group will get 2 eggs (since 8 / 4 = 2). Now, let's count the number of chicks for each group. Since there are 6 chicks in total, and each group gets 2 eggs, each group will have 1 chick ( since 6 / 2 = 3). Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs and 1 chick.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 knickers and 15 eggs. If we divide this equally among three groups, each group will have... (insert your calculation here)
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of 6 eggs each. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with 18 eggs.

We have 18 eggs and we want to divide them into groups of 6 eggs each, so we will divide 18 by 6 = 3. Therefore, we can form 3 groups of 6 eggs each.

Now let's consider the piesangs. We are given that Rebecca has 72 piesangs. Since each group of 6 eggs requires 6 piesangs, we can use 72 / 6 = 12 piesangs per group. Therefore, we can form 3 groups of 12 piesangs each.

Finally, let's consider the knikkers. We are given that Rebecca has 66 knikkers. Since each group of 6 eggs requires 1 knikker, we can use 66 / 1 = 66 knikkers for all the groups together.

So, based on the information provided, Rebecca can form 3 groups of 6 eggs each, which means she can form 3 groups of piesangs (12 per group) and 1 group of knikkers (66). In total, therefore, Rebecca can form 3 + 12 + 1 = 16 groups."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 pieces of eggs and 27 nuts. If we divide them into groups of three, then...

Step 1: Divide 99 eggs among 3 groups = 33 eggs per group (since 99 / 3 = 33).
Step 2: Now, divide 27 nuts among 3 groups = 9 nuts per group (since 27 / 3 = 9).

So, there will be 33 eggs and 9 nuts in each group. Therefore, the number of groups formed is 33 + 9 = 42 groups."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 knickers. To find out how many more eggs she has than knickers, we can use subtraction. So, let's subtract the number of knickers from the total number of eggs:

20 - 6 = 14

Therefore, Rebecca has 14 more eggs than knickers."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 knickers and 12 eggs. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many more eggs she has than knickers. To do this, we can subtract the number of knickers from the total number of eggs: 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Rebecca has 7 more eggs than knickers.
"Response:  If Luke got 154 points and he played a trivia game with 11 questions per round, then...

Round 1: 11 questions x 11 points = 121 points
Round 2: 11 questions x 11 points = 121 points (same as previous round)
Round 3: 11 questions x 11 points = 121 points (again, same as previous round)
...and so on until Round n, where n is the number of rounds Luke played.
Therefore, the total number of points Luke scored is:
121 + 121 +... + 121 = 663 points.
So, Luke played 6 rounds."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a trivia game and scored 46 points in each round, then he has scored a total of:

177 x 46 = 8,322 points
Therefore, Luke has won 8,322 points in the competition."
"Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after playing two rounds of a trivia game and he got the same number of points each round, then we can calculate his score per round as follows:

Round 1: 84 / 2 = 42 points
Round 2: 42 points x 2 = 84 points

Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in Round 1 and 84 points in Round 2."
"Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of the game he played for 157 rounds, then his total score would be:
Total Score = Number of Rounds x Points per Round
= 157 x 146
= 22,392 points
Therefore, Luke scored 22,392 points in the trivia game."
Response:  If Luke played a trivia game and got 3 points in every round of a competition, he would have scored a total of 78 points after playing for x number of rounds. So, we can write an equation as follows: 3x = 78. Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?
Response:  If Emily made 2 kralie headbands for her friends and she could make 32 necklaces in total, then each friend must have received 16 necklaces (32 / 2 = 16). Therefore, each kralie had to have 4 necklaces (16 / 2 = 4).
Response:  If Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace has 28 pearls, then she must have had 28 x 11 = 308 pearls in total. So, Emily had 308 pearls.
Response:  If Emily makes one necklace with 8 large beads and she has 16 large beads in total, then she can make 2 necklaces (since each necklace contains 8 beads). Therefore, Emily can make 2 necklaces.
Response:  If Emily made 18 necklaces and had 6 karat gold, then each chain needed 3 grams of karat gold (18 / 6 = 3). So, the answer is 3 grams.
"Response:  If Emily made 4 hair clips and each clip has 5 pearls, then...

Emily had 4 x 5 = 20 pearls in total."
Response:  If Emily has 72 friends and each friend gets 6 kralie (or beads) then she needs to make 72 x 6 = 432 kralie in total. Since each necklace requires 3 kralie per necklace, Emily can make 432 / 3 = 144 necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 144.
Response:  If Emily made 20 necklaces and she had 5 karat gold, then each necklace required an average of 4 grams (5/20) of gold. So, to make one necklace, Emily needed 4 grams of gold. Since there are 43 friends, we need to divide the total amount of gold used for all necklaces by the number of friends: 4 grams / 43 = 0.096 grams per friend. Therefore, each friend needed approximately 0.1 grams of gold for their necklace.
Response:  If Emily made 44 friendship bracelets for her friends and she made 26 of them herself, then she must have had 17 bracelets left to give away (44 - 26 = 18). Since each bracelet has two knots, Emily gave away 34 knots in total (18 x 2 = 34). So, Emily had 34 knots left after giving away all the bracelets.
"Response:  The number of children who went to camp is 819058, while the other 668278 children stayed at home. So, we can say that the difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of children who went to camp minus the number of children who stayed at home. In mathematical notation, this can be expressed as follows:

Difference = Number of children who went to camp - Number of children who stayed at home
= 819058 - 668278
= 150780
Therefore, there are 150780 more children who went to camp than those who stayed at home."
"Response:  The total number of children who went to camp is 202958, while the other 777622 children stayed at home. So, we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = Total number of children staying at home - Total number of children going to camp
= 777622 - 202958
= 574664

Therefore, there are 574664 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp."
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is 898051. During summer vacation, 629424 children go to camp and the remaining 268627 stay at home. So, the number of children who stay at home is 268627.
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence county is 313473. During summer vacation, 274865 children go to camp. Therefore, the number of children who go to camp during summer vacation is 274865.
"Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County = Total number of children who go to camp + Total number of children at home. 
Total number of children who go to camp = Number of children from Lawrence County x Percentage of children from Lawrence County who go to camp. 
Number of children from Lawrence County = Total number of children in Lawrence County / Total number of counties in the state. 
Percentage of children from Lawrence County who go to camp = (Number of children from Lawrence County x Number of camps) / Total number of children in Lawrence County. 
Now we have all the information we need! To find out how many children are going to camp, we can multiply the percentage of children from Lawrence County who go to camp by the total number of children from Lawrence County. So, there will be 907611 x 0.37 = 335,682 children going to camp."
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is given as 828521. Of these, 800059 go to summer camp and the remaining 284662 stay at home. So, the number of children who stayed at home is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who went to summer camp. Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home is: 828521 - 800059 = 284662.
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is 91676 and during summer vacation, 61619 children went to camp. So, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of children who did not go to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 61619 = 30057. Therefore, 30057 children in Lawrence County did not go to camp during summer vacation.
Response:  The first part of the question states that during summer vacation, 34044 children from Lawrence County go to camp, while the second part says that another 134867 children stay at home. Therefore, the total number of children who went to camp is 34044 + 134867 = 168911. However, the last part of the question mentions that outside of the country, there are 424944 children who have visited the camp. So, in total, we can say that 168911 + 424944 = 593855 children visited the camp.
Response:  The total number of children who go to camp during summer vacation is given as 610769 + 590796 = 1201565. Since some children live outside the country, we subtract them from the total: 1201565 - 22 = 1199343. Therefore, there are 1199343 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is given as 644,997 + 893,835 = 1,538,832. Since 78 children lived outside the country, we subtract this amount from the total to get the number of children actually living in Lawrence County: 1,538,832 - 78 = 1,531,754. Therefore, there are approximately 1,531,754 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  If Adam had 3 more apples than Jackie (Adam = Jackie + 3), then Jackie would have 3 fewer apples than Adam (Jackie = Adam - 3). So, if Adam has 9 apples, Jackie has 6 apples (Jackie = Adam - 3 = 6).
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So, the difference between Adam's apples (10) and Jackie's apples (2) is 8. Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  Adam had 9 apples and Jackie had 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is: 10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. If they had more than what they shared, then Adam would have 4 more apples than he actually has. So, we can write an equation: Adam = 6 - 4 (Adam already has 6 apples). Solving for Adam, we get: Adam = 2 apples. Therefore, Adam has 2 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 9 apples more than what they had initially. So, if they initially had 7 apples, then they now have 9 + 7 = 16 apples in total. Therefore, the answer is 16 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. If Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie must have had 4 apples (12 - 8 = 4). So, Adam has 12 + 8 = 20 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam had 4 more apples than Jackie and they together had 2 apples. So, if Jackie had x apples, then Adam had 4 + x apples. Since they together had 2 apples, we can write an equation: 4 + x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 6. Therefore, Adam had 6 apples.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Adam had five more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie had 89 lemons and 11 apples, then Adam had 89 + 11 = 100 apples. Therefore, Adam had 100 apples.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday being defined as the day before today), Helen baked 270 cookies. Today is the day after yesterday, so Helen has already baked another batch of cookies. Specifically, she baked 419 cookies today. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Helen has baked since yesterday is: 270 + 419 = 689 cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 90 chocolate cookies and her friends are coming over to thank her for them at her house today. So, we can assume that she will have all of these cookies available for her guests. Additionally, we know that she made 51 rose-shaped cookie sandwiches yesterday. Therefore, the total number of chocolate cookies Helen has baked is: 90 + 51 = 141.
Response:  We know that Helen baked 527 chocolate cookies yesterday and 86 rose-flavored cookie sandwiches today. So, in total, she has baked 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies. Therefore, Helen has baked 613 chocolate cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 144 chocolate cookies and 397 cream puffs yesterday. So, the total number of sweet treats she has baked is 144 + 397 = 541. Now, we are asked how many rose-nut cookie she has baked. Based on the information provided earlier, Helen had 85 rose-nut cookies left after she gave some away to her friends. Therefore, the number of rose-nut cookies Helen has baked is 541 - 85 = 456.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies and 231 rose-flavored cookie sandwiches yesterday. Today, she has made 237 chocolate cookies. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of chocolate cookies that Helen baked today and the total number of chocolate cookies that she baked yesterday:

Difference = Number of chocolate cookies baked today - Total number of chocolate cookies baked yesterday
= 237 - 19
= 218

Therefore, Helen baked 218 more chocolate cookies than rose-flavored cookie sandwiches."
Response:  Yesterday (vandag), Helen baked 66 chocolate cookies and today she baked 75 chocolate cookies. So, yesterday she baked 75 - 66 = 8 more chocolate cookies than today. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate cookies that Helen baked yesterday and today is 8.
Response:  Yesterday (vandag), Helen baked 280 rosintjie koekies and 359 sjokoladekoekies, so altogether she baked 639 koekies. Now let's compare this with how many koekies Helen baked yesterday (gister). According to the question, Helen baked 519 sjokoladekoekies and 300 rosinkussekoekies yesterday, which adds up to 819 koekies. So, there are 639 - 819 = 180 more rosinkussekoekies that Helen baked yesterday compared to last night.
Response:  We know that Katie has had 81 games and her friends have had 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has played than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have played from the number of games Katie has played. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie has played 22 more games than her friends.
"Response:  According to the information provided:
Katie had 91 playtime sessions with her old friends and now has 88 playtime sessions with new friends. So, she gained 91 - 88 = 3 playtime sessions with her new friends.
Therefore, her total number of playtime sessions is 53 (old friends) + 3 (new friends) = 56 playtime sessions."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Katie had 78 new games and her friends had 48 new games together. So, the total number of new games they had together is:

78 + 48 = 126

Therefore, the answer is 126."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Katie has had 84 new games and her friends have had 8 new games. So far, they have played a total of 92 new games together (Katie + Friends = 84 + 8).
"Response: 
Katie had 62 new games and 80 old games, so her total number of games is:
62 + 80 = 142
Her friends had 73 new games and 41 old games, so their total number of games is:
73 + 41 = 114
So, Katie has more games than her friends."
Response:  According to the question, Katie has played 57 games and her friend has played 63 games. So, we can say that Katie has played fewer games than her friend. To find out how many more games Katie has played, we need to subtract the number of games her friend has played from the number of games Katie has played. Therefore, the difference between the number of games Katie has played and the number of games her friend has played is 63 - 57 = 6. So, Katie has played 6 more games than her friend.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, the total number of new games among both Katie and her friends is: 57 + 34 = 91. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends (91 - 34 = 57).
"Response: 
Fred had $60 last week and Jason had $19. This means that together they had $89.
Now, let's assume that Jason spent $33 on motorwash. So, he has $62 left ($89 - $33).
Therefore, Jason made $62 by washing motors."
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and then he spent $10 on motor gas. So now he has $76.
Jason had $5 last week and didn't work this week. So he still has $5.
So together they have $76 + $5 = $81."
"Response: 
Fred had $19 last week and earned $21 this week, so his total earnings are:
$19 + ($21 x 3) = $73
Therefore, Fred earned $73 over the two weeks."
"Response: 
Fred had $114 last week and Jason had $22. They spent $100 on motor oil that week and now Fred has $21 and Jason has $78. So, Jason made $56 ($78 - $22) that week."
"Response: 
Fred had $111 last week and spent $35 on motorwashing, so he has $76 left ($111 - $35 = $76).
Jason had $40 last week and spent $20 on car maintenance, so he has $20 left ($40 - $20 = $20).
Now, both of them have money from their respective activities:
Fred earned $115 from motorwashing and has $76 left, so his total earnings are $191 ($76 + $115 = $191).
Jason earned $44 from car maintenance and has $20 left, so his total earnings are $64 ($20 + $44 = $64).
Therefore, the amount they earned from motorwashing is:
$191 (Fred) + $64 (Jason) = $255."
"Response: 
Fred had $49 last week and spent $112 on motor gas this week, so he now has $63 left ($49 + $112 - $112).
Jason had $3 last week and earned $63 from selling newspapers this week, so he now has $60 ($3 + $63 - $112)."
"Response: 
Fred had $78 last week and Jason had $31. Jason worked for 2 days and earned $14. Then Fred spent $90 on motor parts. So their total earnings are:
Fred: $78 + ($14 x 2) = $156
Jason: $31 + $14 = $45
So they earned a total of $156 + $45 = $201 together."
"Response: 
Fred had $33 last week and Jason had $95 last week.
The next week, Fred earned $16 in allowance and spent $74 on motor sports.
So, Fred's total earnings for that week are:
$33 + ($16 x 1) = $59
Therefore, Fred earned $59 over that week."
"Response: 
Fred had $47 last week and Jason had $99 last week. Then, Fred spent $111 on something this week and made $34 from selling motor parts. So, how much money does Fred have now?
Let X be the amount of money Fred has now.
From what we know:
X + $47 = $111 (from the previous week)
X - $34 = $99 (from Jason's money)
Solving for X:
X = $80
So, Fred has $80 now."
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 71 kg. Then she started running every day and lost 20 kg. So now her weight is... (71 - 20) = 51 kg.
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg. If she lost 101 kg after running for some time, then she must have weighed more than 101 kg before starting to run. So, her weight before running was:

Jessie's weight before running = 27 kg + (101 - 27) kg = 74 kg
Therefore, Jessie weighed 74 kg before starting to run."
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. After running for 3 months, she lost weight and now weighs 66 kg. So, her initial weight was 126 - 66 = 60 kg.
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie had a weight of 69 kg. After running every day for some time, she lost 35 kg, which means her current weight is:

69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg

So, Jessie now weighs 34 kg."
Response:  If Jessie started at 114 kg and lost 50 kg in the first week, then her weight after one week would be 114 - 50 = 64 kg. In the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so now her weight is 64 - 60 = 44 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 44 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, which means she ran for 62/9 = 7 days. In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, which means she ran for 140/9 = 15.55 days. Therefore, Jessie started running 15.55 days ago.
Response:  After one week of running, Jessie lost 56 kg (first week). In the second week, she lost an additional 99 kg, for a total loss of 155 kg (second week). So after the first week of training, Jessie had lost 56 kg.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the tank. If 64 snakes have escaped, then the number of remaining snakes is:

Number of remaining snakes = Initial number of snakes - Number of snakes that escaped
= 95 - 64
= 31

Therefore, there are 31 snakes left in the tank after 64 snakes have escaped."
Response:  We know that there were initially 97 alligators in the enclosure. Since 40 of them crawled out, we have to subtract this number from the initial total. Therefore, the number of alligators left inside the enclosure is: 97 - 40 = 57 alligators.
Response:  We know that there were initially three snakes and 75 alligators in the tank. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators left the tank, then we can calculate how many alligators were still in the tank using basic arithmetic. So, if 3 + 75 = 78 (the total number of creatures in the tank), and 82 - 19 = 63 (the number of snakes that left), then we can conclude that there were 63 alligators remaining in the tank after they left. Therefore, the answer is 63 alligators.
Response:  We know that there were initially 79 animals in the enclosure. Of these, 24 snakes and 51 alligators left. So, the number of animals remaining in the enclosure is: 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 animals remaining in the enclosure after the snake and alligator departure.
Response:  If he had 171 turtles and elected 134 of them yesterday, then today he has 37 (171 - 134) turtles left.
Response:  If he had 160 tomatoes yesterday and picked 56 of them today, then he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left. So, he had 104 tomatoes after picking some yesterday.
Response:  The farmer had 90 chickens in his garden yesterday and he chose 154 of them today. So, the total number of chickens the farmer has is: 90 + (154 - 50) = 90 + 104 = 194 chickens.
"Response:  The farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 artichokes in his garden. If he picked 172 artichokes, how many tomatoes and artichokes did he have initially?
Tomatoes: Initially, the farmer had 175 - 172 = 3 tomatoes left.
Artichokes: Initially, the farmer had 77 - 172 = -95 artichokes left (since negative numbers are not possible, we can assume that there were no artichokes left initially)."
"Response:  The farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 artichokes in his garden. If he picked 53 tomatoes, how many did he pick?
To find out, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes he already picked (53) from the total number of tomatoes he had (177). So, there were 124 tomatoes left after he picked 53.
Now, let's check if he also picked any artichokes. He had 12 artichokes initially, so he didn't pick any. Therefore, the final number of tomatoes he had was 124, and the final number of artichokes he had was 12."
"Response:  The total number of tamatoes that Boer had is given as 206 (105 green + 71 red). If he picked 137 tamatoes, then we can find out how many he left behind by subtracting the number he picked from the total number he had:

Number of tamatoes Boer left behind = Total number of tamatoes - Number of tamatoes he picked
= 206 - 137
= 79
Therefore, Boer had 79 tamatoes left in his garden after picking 137."
Response:  According to the problem statement, John uses four nails (spikes) to attach each piece of wood for the house wall. Therefore, he needs 4 x 2 = 8 spikes per plank. Since there are 10 planks in total, John needs 8 x 10 = 80 spikes in total to attach all the planks for the house wall.
Response:  The total number of planks needed for the house wall is given as 13. Each plank requires 17 nails to make it watertight and strong, so we need 17 x 13 = 221 nails in total. Since some of the smaller planks require fewer nails (8 per plank), we can deduce that John needs 221 - 8 = 213 nails for the house wall. Therefore, John needs 213 nails to fix the house wall.
"Response:  We know that John needs to make 11 spikes for each plank and he uses 8 spikes for every subsequent plank. So, if we calculate how many spikes he will need for one plank, we get:
Number of spikes needed per plank = Total number of spikes / Number of planks required
= 49 spikes (answer from previous equation) / 11 planks
= 4.45 spikes per plank
Therefore, John needs approximately 4.45 planks to complete the wall."
Response:  For each large plank (12 pieces), he needs 15 nails to make them all secure. Similarly, for each small plank (10 pieces), he needs 5 nails. So in total, John needs 15 + 5 = 20 nails to fix the walls of the house.
Response:  We know that each plank of wood needs two nails to attach it to the wall. So we need 2 x 16 = 32 nails in total for all four walls. Therefore, John will need 32 nails for the house walls.
Response:  The number of planks needed for each wall is given as 8. Since each plank requires 74 spikes to make it whole, we can calculate the total number of spikes required as follows: Total no. of spikes = Number of planks x No. of spikes per plank Total no. of spikes = 8 x 74 = 592 spikes Therefore, John needs 592 spikes to make all four walls of his house.
Response:  According to the problem statement, John needs 12 large planks and 17 small planks for building the house wall. To make each large plank, he requires 14 spikes, and each small plank requires 25 spikes. Therefore, in total, John needs 12 x 14 = 168 spikes for the large planks and 17 x 25 = 4250 spikes for the small planks. So, John needs a total of 4250 + 168 = 4418 spikes for building the house wall.
Response:  There are 3 pieces of candy in each package and altogether there are 42 pieces of candy. So, if we divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces per package, we get: 42 / 3 = 14 packages. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of candy.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packs of candy and each pack contains 23 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has is:

43 x 23 = 1006

Now, we are told that Robin has 8 extra pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has is:

1006 + 8 = 1014

Therefore, Robin has 1014 pieces of candy in total."
Response:  We know that Robin has 7 pieces of meat in each package and he has 6 extra pieces of meat. So, in total, Robin has 7 + 6 = 13 pieces of meat. Since there are 13 packages, we can conclude that Robin has 13 x 7 = 91 pieces of meat.
Response:  There are 28 packages of cookies and each package contains 13 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has is: 28 x 13 = 356 pieces.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packs of candy and each pack contains 45 pieces of candy. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of candies as follows: Total number of candies = Number of packs x Number of pieces per pack So, Total number of candies = 21 x 45 = 925 pieces of candy.
Response:  There are 28 packages of candy and each package contains 14 pieces of candy. Therefore, there are 28 x 14 = 376 pieces of candy in total. So, Robin has 376 pieces of candy.
"Response:  If the industrial machine can produce 3 hems per minute and it has produced 6 hems in total, then we need to calculate how many minutes it worked. We know that there are 60 seconds in one minute, so:
Minutes = Total time produced / Time produced per minute
= 6 / 3
= 2 minutes
Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 2 minutes."
"Response:  The industrial machine works for 5 minutes and can produce 4 hems per minute. So, in total, it produces... (calculate)

$$ \therefore Total number of hems produced = 5 \times 4 = 20 $$

Therefore, the industrial machine has produced 20 hems."
Response:  The industrial machine made 9 hems yesterday and today it made 44 hems. This means that it can make 3 hems per minute. So, if we calculate how many minutes the machine worked yesterday, we get: Yesterday, the machine worked for (44 - 9) = 35 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine made 13 hems yesterday and today it has made 3 more. So, in total, the machine has worked for x minutes = (13 + 3) minutes = 16 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine made 9 hems yesterday and 8 hems today. This means it can make 2 hems per minute. So, how many minutes did the machine work today? Minutes worked = Number of hems produced / Time taken to produce one hem x 60 (to convert minutes to seconds) Therefore, minutes worked = 8/2 x 60 = 144 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine can make 3 hems per minute, so it made 4 x 3 = 12 hems yesterday and 8 x 3 = 24 hems today. Therefore, the total number of minutes worked by the machine is 12 + 24 = 36 minutes.
"Response:  If it took 12 minutes to make 6 hems last night and 14 minutes today, then we can calculate how many hems were made in total as follows:

Total time = Time last night + Time today
= 12 minutes + 14 minutes
= 26 minutes

So, the machine made 26 / 60 = 42 hems in total."
Response:  The industrial machine can knit 6 hems in one minute, so it has knitted 6 x 5 = 30 hems yesterday and today combined. Therefore, the number of hems the machine made today is 30 + 12 = 42 hems.
Response:  The carnival made $165 in 5 days. So, they made $33 per day ($165 / 5 = $33).
"Response:  The carnival made $144 per day and they were there for 22 days. So, how much money did they make in total?

$144 per day x 22 days = $3,068

Therefore, the carnival made $3,068 during their 22-day stay at the location."
Response:  The carnival made $420 in 30 days. If they won $22 per day, that means they lost $408 per day ($420 - $22). So, the amount of money the ring toss game made each day is $408.
Response:  The first 44 days of the carnival made $382, and the remaining 10 days made $374. So, in total, they made $382 + $374 = $756.
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the first 20 days is $120 and during the overwhelming 16 days it is $66. So, if we divide the total amount earned during the first 20 days by the number of days (20), we get $6 per day. Similarly, if we divide the total amount earned during the overwhelming 16 days by the number of days (16), we also get $6 per day. Therefore, the answer to the question is $6 per day.
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the first 154 days is $325 and during the remaining 57 days it is $114. So, to find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days we can divide the total amount earned during those days by the number of days. Therefore, the daily earnings during the last 57 days are $114 / 57 = $20 per day.
Response:  Lucy went to the bakery after she got 10 packs of cookies. So far, she has bought 10 + 4 = 14 packs of cookies. Therefore, she still has 14 - 10 = 4 packs of cookies left to buy.
Response:  Lucy bought 4 packs of cookies at R30 each, which means she spent R120 on those. Then, she bought 22 packets of chocolate at R50 each, which is R1100. Finally, she bought 16 packets of sweets at R25 each, which is R400. In total, Lucy spent R1610 on all the items from the shopkeeper.
Response:  If Lucy went to the grocery store after she got 23 packs of cookies and bought some more packs of cookies, then she had a total of 27 packages of groceries. So, the answer is 27.
Response:  If Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and each pack contains 12 cookies, then she has bought a total of 2 x 12 = 24 cookies. Since she paid for them with $56, we can calculate the cost per cookie as follows: Cost per cookie = Total amount spent / Number of cookies = $56 / 24 = $2.33 per cookie. Therefore, Lucy has bought a total of 24 cookies.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people on the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. We know that each bus can carry no more than 36 people, so we need to find out how many people are currently on the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus now is: 12 + 4 = 16. So, there are 16 people on the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people on the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus at the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people on the bus. Finally, 3 people got off the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people still on the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people on the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people on the bus. Then, 7 more people got on the bus, so now there are 4 + 7 = 11 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 3 more got off. So, now there are 8 people left on the train. Therefore, there are 8 people on the train currently.
Response:  We know that there were 22 older people in the program and 676 people in total. To find out how many learners were in the program, we need to subtract the number of older people from the total number of people. So, the number of learners is: Total number of people - Number of older people = 676 - 22 = 654 learners.
Response:  We know that there were 73 older people and 724 learners in the program. Therefore, we can say that the total number of people involved in the program is: 73 + 724 = 801. So, there were 801 people involved in the program.
"Response:  We know that there were 174 teachers and 521 students in the program. To find out how many more students are present compared to teachers, we need to divide the number of students by the number of teachers. So, we will use division. 
$$ \frac{521}{174} =? $$
Now, simplify the fraction by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 30.
$$ \frac{521}{174} = \frac{168}{57} = 3 $$.
So, there are 3 times as many students as teachers in the program."
"Response:  We know that there were 61 adults and 177 learners at the program. If we divide the number of learners (177) by the capacity of the program (44), we get...

(177 / 44 = 4)

So, there were 4 times 177 = 708 people at the program."
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and they have to climb 1307 feet. So, we can calculate the distance from the bottom of the cave to its end as follows: Distance = Rise + Run = 1307 - 919 = 388 feet. Therefore, the end of the cave is 388 feet away from the bottom.
Response:  The depth of the cave is given as 1218 feet and they have already traveled 849 feet. To find out how far they are from reaching the end of the cave, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed is 17 miles per hour, which is equal to 10.65 feet per minute (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile). So, if they have been traveling for 30 minutes (which is equal to 30/60 = 0.5 hours), then the distance they have traveled is: Distance = Speed x Time = 10.65 ft/min x 0.5 hours = 5.325 feet. Therefore, they are still 786.75 feet away from reaching the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that they are currently at an altitude of 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet deep. To find out how far they have to go before reaching the end of the cave, we can use the following formula: Distance = Altitude - Depth. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Distance = 659 - 762 = -103 feet. So, they still have to travel 103 feet before reaching the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that Katie had 12 goldfish (6 with their backs facing and 6 others). Then, Page made 8 more goldfish grow big. So, we have to find out how many goldfish are left after they all disappeared. The total number of goldfish is equal to the initial amount minus the ones that disappeared. Therefore, the answer is: 12 - 8 = 4 goldfish remained after they all disappeared.
Response:  If Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in the pond big, but the street cats have eaten them all. Now she has 15 ears. So, we need to find out how many fish have disappeared. To do this, we can use subtraction. The difference between the number of fish Paige had before (7 + 12 = 19) and the number of ears she now has (15) is equal to the number of fish that have disappeared. Therefore, the answer is 19 - 15 = 4.
Response:  If Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond big, but the street cats have eaten them all. Now she has only two ears left. So, the number of goldfish that disappeared is 16 - 2 = 14.
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish in the pond and that the cat ate 5 of them. So, we have to find out how many goldfish are left after the cat ate some of them. To do this, we can use subtraction. If we subtract 5 from 15, we get 10. Therefore, there were 10 goldfish left in the pond after the cat ate some of them.
Response:  The chef had initially 43 apples and then he gave 2 pastries to someone. So, after giving away the pastries, the chef had __________ apples left.
Response:  If he had 58 apples and made some pies using 20 of them, then he has 58 - 20 = 38 apples left. After that, if he used 35 more apples to make additional pies, then he has 38 - 35 = 13 apples left. So, there are 13 apples left.
Response:  We know that after making some pies, he had 39 ears. And we also know that he started with 40 apples and ended up with 39 ears. So, if he used all of his 40 apples to make pies, then he must have made 40/3 = 13 pies.
Response:  The number of action figures that Adam can place on each shelf is 11. Since there are four shelves, he can place 4 x 11 = 44 action figures altogether. Therefore, the total number of action figures that Adam can place in his room is 40 + 44 = 84 action figures.
Response:  If Adam has 10 action figures per shelf and each shelf can hold 8 action figures, then he must have had 10/8 = 1.25 shelves. So, he had 1 + 1 +... + 1 = 4 shelves in total.
Response:  Since there are 8 action figures and 10 castles per shelf in Adam's room, we can calculate how many total items he has as follows: Number of shelves = Total number of items / Number of action figures + Total number of castles. In this case, the calculation would be: Number of shelves = 4 racks x (8 action figures + 10 castles) = 4 x 18 = 72 items. Therefore, Adam has 72 items in his room.
Response:  There are 10 gardens with 544 pots each, so there are 544 x 10 = 5440 pots in total. Each pot has 32 flowers, so there are 5440 x 32 = 176880 flowers in total.
Response:  There are 466 pots and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 stalks of flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is: 466 x 53 = 24,798 flowers. The total number of stalks of flowers is: 466 x 181 = 86,066 stalks. So there are 24,798 flowers and 86,066 stalks of flowers in total.
Response:  There are 141 pots and each pot has 71 flowers inside it. Therefore, there are total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. So, the answer is 9671 flowers.
Response:  If there are 40 flowers in each pot and we have 400 pots in total, then... (1)...the number of flowers in all pots is equal to the number of pots multiplied by the number of flowers in one pot: 400 pots x 40 flowers/pot = 16,000 flowers. Therefore, there are 16,000 flowers in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 Erasers altogether. Since they will be organized into groups of 154 each, we need to divide both numbers by 154. So, the size of each group would be: 

Number of Skittles / Number of Groups = Size of Each Group
= 4502 / 154 = 29
Similarly, for Erasers:

Number of Erasers / Number of Groups = Size of Each Group
= 4276 / 154 = 28
Therefore, each group contains approximately 29 Skittles or 28 Erasers."
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's Skittles collection and he has 4950 outliers. Since these outliers are organized into groups of 495 each, we can calculate the size of each group as follows: Number of groups = Total number of outliers / Size of each group = 4950 / 495 = 10 Groups Therefore, each group contains 495 Skittles.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and they are divided into 8 groups of equal size. Therefore, we can say that each group contains $\frac{896}{8} = 112$ Skittles.
Response:  The number of students in each grade = 5 (given). Number of grades = 7 (since there are 7 different grades mentioned in the problem). So, total number of students = Total number of grades x Number of students per grade = 7 x 5 = 35. Therefore, there are 35 grades in total.
Response:  The school has 304 grades and each grade has 75 students. So, we need to find out how many students are there in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of grades with the number of students in each grade. Therefore, the total number of students is: 304 x 75 = 22,500 students.
