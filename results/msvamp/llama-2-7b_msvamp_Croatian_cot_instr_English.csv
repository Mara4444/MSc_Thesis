Response:  In Monday (ponedjeljak), Julia played tag with 18 children.  In Tuesday (utorak), she played tag with 10 children. So, we can write an equation: Number of children in Monday = Number of children in Tuesday + 8 To solve for the difference between the number of children in Monday and Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children in Tuesday from the number of children in Monday: Difference = Number of children in Monday - Number of children in Tuesday Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Difference = 18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, there were 8 more children who played tag with Julia in Monday than in Tuesday.;
Response:  In Monday (ponedjeljak), Julia played tag with 11 children.  In Tuesday (utorak), she played tag with 12 children. So, we can write an equation: Number of children in Tuesday = Number of children in Monday + 1 We know that the number of children in Monday was 11, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Number of children in Tuesday = 11 + 1 = 12 Therefore, there were 12 more children playing tag with Julia in Tuesday than in Monday.;
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday. So, in total she played with 5 + 7 = 12 children. Therefore, she played with 12 children in total.;
Response:  Julia played tag with some kids on Monday and then she played tag with 14 children on Tuesday. So, if she played with a total of 16 children, that means she played with 2 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  If Julia played tag with 16 children on Monday and more than 12 children on Tuesday, then she must have played tag with at least 4 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday. So, if Jula played tag with 12 children on Tuesday, then she must have played tag with 16 + 12 = 28 children in total.;
Response:  If Julia played tag with 14 children on Tuesday and then played with 8 more children on Wednesday, that means she played with a total of 22 children (14 + 8). So, Julia played tag with 22 children in total between Tuesday and Wednesday.;
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday, she played with 15 children and on Wednesday, she played with 2 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.;
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So far, we have 15 + 18 = 33 children she played with in total. Then, she played with 97 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played with is 33 + 97 = 120 children.;
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 9 children on Tuesday. So, in total she played with 5 + 9 = 14 children.;
Response:  Julia played with 2 children in Monday and 16 children in Saturday. So, she played with 2 + 16 = 18 children in total.;
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 9 children.  In Tuesday, she played with 7 children. So, in total, Julia played with 16 children (9 + 7). Now, let's compare how many more children Julia played with in Monday than in Tuesday:  Number of children Julia played with in Monday - Number of children Julia played with in Tuesday = 16 - 7 = 9 Therefore, Julia played with 9 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.;
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 14 children.  In Tuesday, she played with 2 children in the morning and 8 children in the afternoon. So, in total, Julia played with 14 + 2 = 16 children on Monday and 8 children on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played more with children on Monday than on Tuesday.;
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 8 children.  On Tuesday, she played with 11 children.  On Wednesday, she played with 9 children. So, we can write an equation: 8 + 11 = 9. Solving for the difference between the number of children played with on Tuesday and Wednesday, we get: 3 = 3. Therefore, Julia played with 3 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.;
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday, 18 children on Tuesday, and 7 children on Wednesday. So, in total, she played with 15 + 18 + 7 = 40 children. Therefore, Julia played with more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday.;
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (utorak), she played with 10 children. On Wednesday (srijeda), she played cards with 15 children. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.;
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday (utorak), she played with 13 children. And on Wednesday (srijeda), she played with 20 children. So in total, Julia played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children. Therefore, Julia played with 40 children playing the game of catch with a ball.;
Response:  Julia played tag with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. In total, she spent 34 hours playing tag with them both days combined. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children = Total time / Time per child Julia played tag with 12 children for x hours on Monday, where x is equal to 34 divided by 12, which gives us x = 3 hours. Similarly, she played tag with 14 children for y hours on Tuesday, where y is equal to 34 divided by 14, which gives us y = 2 hours. Therefore, Julia played tag with a total of 3 + 2 = 5 hours with all 26 children (12 + 14) together.;
Response:  Julia played tag with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. In total, she spent 38 hours playing tag with them both days combined. So, to find out how many more children Julia played tag with on Monday than on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  Number of children Julia played tag with on Monday = 19  Number of children Julia played tag with on Tuesday = 18  Difference between the two numbers = 19 - 18 = 1 Therefore, Julia played tag with 1 more child on Monday than on Tuesday.;
Response:  In Tuesday (ponedjeljak), Julia played with six children.  In Thursday (utorak), she played with five children. So, we can say that in Pon;
Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. She played with 4 children on Monday and some other children on Tuesday. So, she played with 4 + x children on Tuesday, where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Since she played with 3 children on Tuesday, we can conclude that x = 3. Therefore, Julia played with 4 + 3 = 7 children on Tuesday.;
Response:  Julia played with 4 children in Wednesday and 6 children in Monday. So, she played with more children in Monday than in Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Wednesday is 6 - 4 = 2.;
"Response:  If Bobby has eaten some pieces of candy and then he ate another 25 pieces, we can say that at first he had x pieces of candy. Since he ate 25 more pieces after that, now he has x + 25 pieces of candy. We are asked how many pieces of candy Bobby initially had, so we need to find out what value of x satisfies this condition. Let's use algebra to solve for x:
x = 43 - (25)
x = 18
So, Bobby initially had 18 pieces of candy.";
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 28 comics of bubble gum and then he ate another 42, that means he has eaten in total 28 + 42 = 70 comics of bubble gum.  Similarly, if he has also eaten 63 pieces of chocolate, we can say that he has eaten 70 + 63 = 133 pieces of candy in total. Therefore, Bobby has pojeo 133 comads of bubble gum.;
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 33 pieces of candy and then he ate another 4 pieces. So, in total, he has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Additionally, he has also eaten 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the final answer is:  Bobby has eaten 37 pieces of candy and 14 pieces of chocolate.;
Response:  Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces. So in total, he has eaten 74 pieces of candy. However, we are also told that he has eaten 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the number of candies and chocolates is:  74 - 16 = 58  So, Bobby has eaten 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate.;
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 34 + 18 = 52 bombons. So he still has 20 - 52 = -38 bombons left. Since there are no negative numbers of bombons, we can conclude that Bobby did not eat any bombons. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 (zero) bombons.;
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially. He ate 5 pieces of bubble gum. Then he ate another 9 pieces of candy. So far, he has eaten a total of 14 pieces of candy (5 + 9 = 14). Therefore, he still has 7 pieces of candy left (21 - 14 = 7).;
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some and then he ate another 5 pieces. So, at this point, he has eaten a total of 5 + 5 = 10 pieces of candy. Therefore, there are 22 - 10 = 12 pieces of candy left.;
Response:  If Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate two pieces, then he has 17 pieces left (19 - 2 = 17). So, Bobby still has 17 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, then he has fewer pieces of candy left. We can assume that he ate half of his candy, so he has 32 / 2 = 16 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby ate 16 pieces of candy.;
Response:  Bobby had 36 pieces of candy initially. He already ate 17 pieces, so he has 36 - 17 = 19 pieces left. Then, he ate another 15 pieces, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 pieces left. Therefore, Bobby has 4 pieces of candy left.;
Response:  If Bobby had initially 30 pieces of candy and he ate 23 pieces, then he has 7 remaining (30 - 23 = 7).;
Response:  If Alan gave 5 balloons to Jake and Jake gave 3 balloons in the park, then we can say that the total number of balloons given by both is equal to 8 (5 + 3). So, there were 8 balloons in the park. Therefore, the correct answer is: 8;
Response:  If Alan gave 2 balloons to Jake and Jake gave 3 balloons in the park, then we can say that Jake had 3 - 2 = 1 more balloon than Alan in the park. So, Jake had 4 balloons in the park (not including the ones he brought).;
Response:  If Alan and Jake together have donated three balloons to the park, then we can say that Alan has donated x balloons and Jake has donated y balloons, where x + y = 3 (the total number of balloons). Since Alan has donated two balloons, we can write x = 2. Now, we need to find out how many balloons Jake has donated. Using the equation from above, we get y = 1, since Jake has donated one balloon. So, the final answer is: x = 2 and y = 1.;
Response:  If Jake has given 6 balloons to the park and Allan has given 4 balloons less than the number of balloons that Jake gave to the park, then we can say that Allan gave 2 balloons to the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons given by Jake and Allan is 4 (i.e., 6 - 2 = 4). So, the correct answer is 4.;
Response:  If Allan gave 5 balloons to the park and Jake gave 6 more than the number of balloons given by Allan, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of balloons given by Jake = Number of balloons given by Allan + 6  Substituting the values from the question into this equation, we get:  Number of balloons given by Jake = 5 + 6  Number of balloons given by Jake = 11  Therefore, Jake gave 11 balloons to the park.;
"Response: 
Alan gave 3 balloons to Jake and Jake gave 5 balloons in the park. So, together they had 8 balloons (3 + 5 = 8). Then, Alan bought two more balloons in the park, so now he has 10 balloons (8 + 2 = 10). Therefore, the final number of balloons that Alan and Jake have in the park is 10.";
"Response: 
Alan gave 2 balloons to Jake in the park. So, Jake had 4 balloons and Alan had 2 balloons.  Then, Alan bought 3 more balloons in the park. Now, Jake has 4 balloons, and Alan has 5 balloons (including the ones he already had). Therefore, there are 5 balloons more than Jake in the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 5 - 4 = 1. So, Alan had one more balloon than Jake in the park.";
"Response: 
Alan gave 2 balloons to Jake and then bought 3 more in the park. So, at first, Jake had 6 - 2 = 4 balloons. Then, Alan added 3 more balloons, so now Jake has 4 + 3 = 7 balloons. Therefore, Jake had 7 balloons more than Alan in the park.";
Response:  Firstly, Alan gave 5 balloons to Jake and then he bought 3 more in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Alan brought into the park is: 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.;
"Response: 
Alan gave 6 balloons to Jake and then Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Jake had is: 6 + 3 = 9.  Therefore, Alan had more balloons than Jake in the park.";
"Response: 
Alan gave 6 balloons to Jake and then Jake bought 4 more in the park. So, if we add these two amounts together, we get: 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, Jake had 10 balloons more than Alan in the park.";
"Response: 
Alan gave 5 balloons to Jake and then Jake bought 3 more in the park. So, if we add up all the balloons that Jake had or received, we get: 
Jake initially got 5 + 3 = 8 balloons from Alan and later bought 3 more in the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons Jake donated is 8 + 3 = 11 balloons.";
Response:  We know that Alan gave 3 balloons and 20 pencils to the park, so he had 3 + 20 = 23 items in the park. Similarly, we know that Jake gave 5 balloons and 59 pencils to the park, so he had 5 + 59 = 64 items in the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Alan and Jake had in the park is 23 + 64 = 87 balloons.;
Response:  We know that Alan gave 7 balloons and 5 pencils to Jake in the park. Then, we are told that Jake gave 6 balloons and 4 pencils back to Alan in the park. So, if they had an equal number of pencils before (i.e., both had 5), then after exchanging gifts, Alan would have 12 pencils (7 + 5) while Jake would have 9 pencils (6 + 4). Therefore, the final answer is:  Alan has 12 pencils, and Jake has 9 pencils.;
Response:  If Alan gave 5 balloons and Jake gave 1 balloon, then together they gave 5 + 1 = 6 balloons to the park. So, Jake donated 6 - 5 = 1 balloon in the park.;
Response:  If Allan gave 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more, he has a total of 5 balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5).  Now, if Jake also brought 6 balloons to the park, that means Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park. So, the answer is 1.;
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese.  To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages.  So, if he spends 6 x 6 = 36 hours studying English and 2 x 2 = 4 hours studying Chinese, then he spends 36 - 4 = 32 hours more studying English than Chinese.";
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, in this case, Ryan spends 7 - 6 = 1 hour more studying Chinese than English. Therefore, the answer is 1 hour.;
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and additional several hours learning Chinese every day, then he spends total of x hours learning Chinese per day. Since he spends overall 4 hours learning both languages each day, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 3 = 4... (1)
Now, let's solve for x in this equation. We know that x is the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese per day. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation gives us:
x = 1... (2)
Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour learning Chinese per day.";
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and x hours studying Chinese per day, then he spends total of 7x hours studying both languages together.  If he increases his time spent studying English by 2 hours per day, then he will spend total of 7x + 4 hours studying both languages together. So, if he spends more time studying English than Chinese, it means that (7x + 4) > x. Therefore, the difference between the number of hours he spends studying English and Chinese is at least 3 hours.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and additional several hours studying English, then he spends x hours studying English more than he studies Chinese.  Since Ryan spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 2.  Therefore, Ryan spends 2 hours more studying English than he does Chinese.;
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese for 5 days, then he will spend a total of:

6 x 5 = 30 hours studying English
7 x 5 = 35 hours studying Chinese

So in total, Ryan will spend 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages over the course of 5 days.";
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese, then in one day he will spend:

6 hours x 2 days = 12 hours studying English
5 hours x 2 days = 10 hours studying Chinese
Total time spent studying both languages together is:
12 hours + 10 hours = 22 hours
Therefore, if Ryan studies two days, he will spend a total of 44 hours (22 hours x 2 days) studying both English and Chinese.";
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese, he will spend a total of:

English: 5 x 6 = 30 hours
Chinese: 4 x 6 = 24 hours
Total time spent studying: 30 + 24 = 54 hours
Therefore, if Ryan practices for 6 days, he will have studied Chinese for a total of 54 hours.";
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent a total of:

Total time spent learning English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours
Total time spent learning Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours
In total, Ryan will have spent 856 hours (352 + 504) learning both languages over the course of 86 days.";
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, so he studies English for:

6 hours/day x 7 days/week = 42 hours/week

Now, let's calculate how many hours Ryan spends studying Chinese and Spanish:

He spends 3 hours per week studying Spanish, so he studies Spanish for:

3 hours/week x 7 weeks/month = 21 hours/month

He spends 0 hours per week studying Chinese, since he only attends classes on Saturdays. So, he studies Chinese for:

0 hours/week x 7 weeks/month = 0 hours/month

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of:

42 hours/week studying English + 21 hours/month studying Spanish - 0 hours/month studying Chinese = 63 hours/month";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English for 3 hours, which means he studies English for a total of 18 hours per day (6 x 3 = 18).  Secondly, we know that Ryan spends 58 hours per week studying Spanish (58/7 = 8.42 hours per day), so he spends more time studying Spanish than any other language. Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying English than Kinesi.;
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English for 2 hours, Chinese for 4 hours, and Spanish for 4 hours.  To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent studying Spanish from the total time spent studying both languages.  So, let's do that:
Total time studying both languages = 7 hours/day x 2 hours/day + 7 hours/day x 4 hours/day = 14 hours/day
Time studying Spanish = 7 hours/day x 4 hours/day = 28 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 28 - 14 = 14 hours more studying English than Spanish.";
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours studying English every day. 
He also studies Chinese for 2 hours and Spanish for 4 hours. So he has spent a total of 7 hours (5 + 2 + 4) studying languages each day.";
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and Kinesi every day, then he spends 3 + 3 = 6 hours learning languages per day.  If he spends 2 hours learning English every day, then he spends 2/6 = 0.33 hours (or 23 minutes) learning Chinese per day.;
Response:  Day 1: Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese. Total time spent = 9 hours (4 + 5). Day 2-7: Ryan continues to spend 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, total time spent learning English for each of these days is also 9 hours (4 x 7 = 28). Similarly, total time spent learning Chinese for each of these days is also 25 hours (5 x 7 = 35). So in total, Ryan spends 9 hours per day learning English and 25 hours per day learning Chinese.;
Response:  On Monday, she collected 8 cans for recycling. If she found additional 7 cans on Tuesday, then the total number of cans she had on Monday and Tuesday is: 8 + 7 = 15 cans. Therefore, there were 7 more cans on Tuesday than on Monday.;
"Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Tiffany collected 7 cans for recycling. If she found more cans on Tuesday (slijedeći dan), then we know that the number of cans she found increased by some amount. To find out how much it increased, we need to subtract the number of cans she already had from the total number of cans she found on Tuesday. So, if she found 12 additional cans on Tuesday, and she already had 7 cans on Monday, then the total number of cans she found on Tuesday is:

Total = 7 + 12 = 19

Therefore, Tiffany found 19 cans more than she found on Monday.";
Response:  If Tiffany collected 4 cans of food for recycling on Monday and found another can on Tuesday, then she has collected a total of 5 cans (4 + 1) on those two days combined. So, if she collects x more cans on Wednesday, then the total number of cans she will have collected is 5 + x.;
Response:  If Tiffany collected cans for recycling and had bags of them on Monday, then she must have had x bags of cans on Monday. Since she found 4 more bags of cans on Tuesday, we know that the total number of bags of cans she had is equal to x + 4. Therefore, the number of bags of cans Tiffany had on Monday was 8 (x + 4).;
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Tiffany had 10 containers of canned food for recycling. If she found three more containers on Tuesday (utorak), then she had a total of 10 + 3 = 13 containers of canned food on Tuesday. And if she found seven more containers on Wednesday (srijeda), then she had a total of 13 + 7 = 20 containers of canned food on Wednesday. So, in total, Tiffany had 20 containers of canned food.;
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Tiffany collected 8 cans for recycling. If she found 10 more cans on Tuesday and 4 more cans on Wednesday, then we can write an equation based on these numbers:  Number of cans = 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 cans. Therefore, Tiffany found 22 cans after Monday.;
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 3 vreća (or containers) of canned food for recycling. The next day she found an additional 7 vreća (or containers) of canned food and 44 vreća (or containers) of bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had 3 + 7 = 10 vreća of canned food and 44 vreća of bottles.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 red peppers and 16 green peppers in the bag. To find out how many more red peppers there are than green peppers, we can subtract the number of green peppers from the total number of peppers: 17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red pepper in the bag than green peppers.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 red peppers and 11 green peppers in the bag. To find out how many more green peppers there are than red peppers, we can subtract the number of red peppers from the total number of peppers:  Number of green peppers = Total number of peppers - Number of red peppers = 11 - 5 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more green peppers in the bag than red peppers.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 red beans and some more green beans in the bag. So, if we have a total of 15 beans in the bag, then the number of green beans must be equal to 15 - 10 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green beans in the bag.;
"Response:  We know that there are more green beans than red beans in the bag. So, if there are x green beans and y red beans, then we can write an equation as follows:
x > y
Now, let's assume that the number of green beans is 10 more than the number of red beans. This means that:
x = y + 10
Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
y + 10 > y
Simplifying the inequality, we have:
2 > 0
Which simplifies to:
2 = 2
So, there are equal numbers of green and red beans in the bag.";
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red beans, and each of them has 3 beans inside (since they say ""crvene"" which means ""red""). So, we have:

7 red beans x 3 beans per red bean = 21 beans in total
Now, let's count how many yellow and green beans there are:
There are 15 yellow beans, so we multiply their number by the number of beans per yellow bean to get:

15 yellow beans x 4 beans per yellow bean = 60 beans
And finally, there are 8 green beans, so we multiply their number by the number of beans per green bean to get:

8 green beans x 2 beans per green bean = 16 beans
So, in total, there are 21 + 60 + 16 = 97 beans in the basket!";
Response:  We know that there are 7 red beans and 71 yellow beans in the basket. Since we also know that there are 8 green beans for every 5 red or yellow beans, we can calculate how many green beans there are as follows: Number of green beans = (Number of red beans x 8) + (Number of yellow beans x 8) = (7 x 8) + (71 x 8) = 56 + 576 = 632 green beans Therefore, there are 632 green beans in the basket.;
Response:  We have 6 yellow balls and 14 green balls in the basket. If we subtract the number of yellow balls from the total number of balls, we get: 6 + 14 = 20. So there are 20 balls in the basket altogether. Now, let's find out how many green balls there are among them: 6 yellow balls x 14 green balls = 84 green balls. Therefore, there are 84 green balls in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 red peppers in total and 11 yellow ones. So, we can say that the number of red peppers is greater than or equal to the number of yellow peppers (since they have the same denominator). Therefore, the number of red peppers must be at least 11 + 1 = 12. Since there are 12 green peppers as well, the total number of red peppers cannot exceed this value. Hence, the correct answer is: There are between 12 and 13 red peppers in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 red beans and 16 green beans in the basket. If we divide the number of red beans by 2, we get 3 red beans per row. Similarly, if we divide the number of green beans by 2, we get 8 green beans per row. Therefore, the total number of red beans in one row is 3 x 9 = 27, and the total number of green beans in one row is 8 x 9 = 72. Since there are 9 rows in the basket, the total number of red beans in the basket is 27 x 9 = 243, and the total number of green beans in the basket is 72 x 9 = 658. So, there are 243 red beans and 658 green beans in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 red beans and 14 yellow beans in the basket. To find out how many red beans there are in total, we can multiply the number of red beans by the ratio of red to total beans: 18/32 = 0.56 (red beans). So, there are approximately 56% red beans in the basket. Similarly, we can calculate the percentage of yellow beans as follows: 14/32 = 0.44 (yellow beans). Therefore, there are approximately 44% yellow beans in the basket.;
Response:  We have 5 red beans and we need to find out how many yellow and green beans are in the basket. So, if there are 5 red beans, then there must be 9 yellow and green beans ( since 5 + 9 = 14). Therefore, there are 9 yellow and green beans in the basket.;
Response:  We have 65 košara and each košara has 7 red beans and 3 green beans. So, we can calculate the total number of beans as follows: Total number of red beans = 7 x 65 = 455Total number of green beans = 3 x 65 = 195So, there are 455 + 195 = 650 beans in all the 65 košara together.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 košara and each košara has 10 red beans and 18 green beans. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of red beans = 10 x 11 = 110 Number of green beans = 18 x 11 = 208 Therefore, there are 110 red beans and 208 green beans in total.;
Response:  We have 6 košara of bruskva and each košara has 16 red and 18 green bruskva. So, in total we have:  Red bruskva = 16 x 6 = 96 Green bruskva = 18 x 6 = 108 Therefore, there are 96 red bruskva in all six košara together.;
Response:  We have 7 košara of mixed nuts (breskva). Each košar has 10 red and 2 green breskva. So, in total we have:  Red breskva = 10 x 7 = 70 Green breskva = 2 x 7 = 14 Therefore, there are 14 green breskva in all 7 košara.;
Response:  We know that each coarse has 4 red beans and 3 green beans. So, if we have total of 7 beans in all courses, then number of courses is: Number of red beans = Total number of beans - Number of green beans  Number of red beans = 7 - 3 = 4 Courses Therefore, there are 4 courses of beans.;
"Response:  We know that there are two coats in total and each coat has 4 red apples and some green apples. So, we have:

Coat 1: 4 red apples + x green apples = 12 apples
Coat 2: 4 red apples + x green apples = 12 apples

We also know that the total number of apples is 12, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 12

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 6

So, there are 6 green apples in each coat.";
Response:  We know that there are 16 berries in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we have some green berries left, then the number of green berries is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green berries in the basket.;
Response:  We know that each coarse has 19 red and 4 green beans. So, in total, there are 19 + 4 = 23 beans per course. Since we have 15 courses, the total number of beans is 23 x 15 = 345.;
Response:  If there are 10 red beans equally distributed in some containers and each container has 4 red beans, then the total number of red beans is 10 x 4 = 40.  Now, if there are 6 green beans for every 4 red beans, then the total number of green beans is 6 x (40/4) = 240. Therefore, there are 240 green beans in total.;
Response:  We have 6 green beans, which means we can write down 6 as x. Then, we have 60 yellow beans, which means we can write down 60 as y. Finally, we have 2 red beans, which means we can write down 2 as z. Now, let's calculate how many more green beans there are than red beans: 6 - 2 = 4. So, there are 4 more green beans than red beans in the bag.;
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf initially. He later added more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, he has 8 action figures on the shelf now. Therefore, he must have added 4 action figures to the shelf.;
Response:  If Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially and later added 7 more action figures to the same shelf, then we can say that the total number of action figures he has now is equal to the initial number plus the additional ones. So, if Jerry had x action figures on his shelf initially, then he has x + 7 action figures now. Therefore, the answer is x = 3.;
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 6 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are now 10 action figures (4 + 6) on the shelf.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 12 (5 + 7) action figures on the shelf. Now, let's count how many books are left. We know that Jerry had 9 books initially, and then he didn't add any more later, so there are still 9 books on the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures is greater than the number of books - 12 > 9. The difference between these two numbers is 3, which means that Jerry has 3 more action figures than books on his shelf.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had two action figures and ten books on his shelf. Later, he added four more action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. Now, let's count how many books are left. We know that at first Jerry had ten books, which means that after adding four more action figures, there are still ten - 6 = 4 books left on the shelf. Therefore, the final number of books on Jerry's shelf is 4.;
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 10 books to the shelf. So, in total, there are 8 + 10 = 18 books on the shelf now.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, initially there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. After adding 4 more books, the total number of items on the shelf became 9 + 4 = 13. Therefore, the correct answer is 13 - 7 = 6 action figures were on the shelf initially.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added another 9 books to the shelf. So, in total, there were 14 items (5 action figures + 2 books + 9 new books) on the shelf. Therefore, the number of books more than action figures is 14 - 5 = 9.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures on his desk. Then he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, in total, there are now 13 action figures on the desk (8 + 4 - 5).;
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures on his desk initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures and removed some of the old ones. So, if he has 6 action figures on the desk now, that means he removed 3 - 6 = 3 action figures from the desk. Therefore, Jerry removed 3 action figures from the desk.;
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added more action figures and removed 10 old ones. So, if he now has 8 action figures on the shelf, that means he added 8 - 7 = 1 new action figure to the collection.;
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 old ones. If he now has 10 action figures on the shelf, then we can deduce that he had 3 action figures on the shelf initially (the number he added later is equal to the number he already had). So, Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf at first.;
Response:  Jerry had 9 action figures on his desk initially. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the desk. So, in total, Jerry has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on his desk now. Since we are asked how many more action figures than books Jerry has, we can say that for every book (knife) there is one action figure (figure). Therefore, if Jerry has 10 books on his desk, then he must have 10 x 1 = 10 action figures on his desk as well. So, the answer is 10.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added another 2 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 5 (books + action figures) objects on the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures is 7 - 3 = 4 more than the number of books.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added another two action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. Therefore, the number of books minus the number of action figures is equal to 9 - 3 = 6. Thus, Jerry had 6 books on his shelf initially.;
Response:  We know that two birds were already sitting on the fence and another bird joined them. So, there are three birds on the fence in total. Now, we are asked how many more birds joined them. Therefore, the answer is 3 + x = 6, where x is the number of birds that joined them. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, there were 3 additional birds that joined the original two birds on the fence, making a total of 5 birds on the fence.;
Response:  At first, there was one bird on the fence (the initial situation). Then four more birds came to join it (the additional information). So, in total, there are now five birds on the fence (the final situation). Therefore, the answer is 1 + 4 = 5.;
Response:  We know that 46 storks were already sitting on the fence and then 6 more joined them. So, in total, we have 52 birds (46 + 6) sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have three storks and two cranes already sitting on the fence. If five more birds join them, then there will be a total of 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. So, the answer is 5.;
Response:  We have three triangles and four squares sitting on the fence. Two birds join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are more than seven storks sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have two birds and six sparrows sitting on the fence initially. Then three more birds join them. So, in total, we have 2 + 3 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's count the number of sparrows again: 6 + 3 = 9 sparrows are now sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 5 birds and 9 sparrows in total sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have four birds and six fences posts. Two more fence posts are added, so now we have two additional fence posts. Therefore, the total number of fence posts is 6 + 2 = 8. Since each bird is sitting on one fence post, there are eight birds in total. So, the answer is 8.;
Response:  We have three triangles and four squares sitting on the fence. If six more chickens join them, then we will have: 3 x 3 = 9 triangles + 4 x 2 = 8 squares = 17 birds in total. So, there are 17 birds (including both chickens and triangles) sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have six birds and three storks sitting on the fence. Two crows join them. So now we have six + two = eight birds and still only three storks. Therefore, there are more birds than storks sitting on the fence. The correct answer is 8 - 3 = 5 more birds than storks.;
Response:  We have four birds and three storks already sitting on the fence. If six more chords join them, then we will have: Birds + Storks = 4 + 3 = 7. So there are seven animals in total sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are more storks than birds sitting on the fence (seven storks - four birds). The correct answer is: More storks than birds sit on the fence.;
"Response:  We have 6 birds that are already sitting on the fence. If we add another 4 birds and 8 branches (or ""čvorovi""), then there will be a total of 10 objects (birds + branches) sitting on the fence. So, to answer your question, there are 10 birds sitting on the fence.";
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence initially. Then five more birds join them, making it seven in total. Next, four crows join, bringing the total number of birds to eleven. So, there are eleven birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have three birds and six storks initially sitting on the fence. If two more birds join them, there will be five birds in total (including the original three). However, if six storks also join them, then we have eleven animals (five birds + six storks) sitting on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is eleven.;
"Response:  We have:
Pet štorka (1) + Tri ptice (3) = Total of birds sitting on fence (4).
So there are more birds than storks sitting on the fence.";
Response:  We have six frogs and two birds sitting on the fence. If three more birds join them, then we will have... (6 + 2) = 8 creatures sitting on the fence in total! So, there are more frogs than birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have 3 crows sitting on the fence initially. Then, 6 more crows join them, making it 9 crows in total. Finally, 2 pigeons also join the group, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (9 crows + 2 pigeons). Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, if the first chapter has x pages and the second chapter has y pages, then the total number of pages in the book is x + y.  Now, based on the information given in the question, we know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. Therefore, we can write the equation:  x + y = 59 (since 48 + 11 = 59).  Solving for x, we get:  x = 37 ( since 59 - 11 = 48).  Therefore, there are 37 pages more in the first chapter than in the second chapter.;
Response:  First, we need to find out how many pages are in each of the two chapters. So, if the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages, then the difference between them is:  Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter.;
"Response:  First, we know that the book has two chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. Therefore, if the first chapter has 60 pages, then the second chapter must have x pages, where x is the difference between 93 and 60. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 93 - 60
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 33
Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.";
Response:  First, we know that the book has two chapters and the second chapter has 36 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter plus the number of pages in both chapters. So, if the first chapter has x pages, then the total number of pages in the book is given by: x + (36) = 67. Solving for x, we get: x = 31. Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages So, there are 125 pages in the book.;
Response:  First, we know that the book has three chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. We are given that the first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many more pages there are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, there are 68 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 35 pages in the first chapter and 18 pages in the second chapter. Therefore, the total number of pages in the two chapters is: 35 + 18 = 53 pages. Now, let's compare this with the third chapter which has only 3 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the third chapter is: 53 - 3 = 50 pages.  Therefore, there are 50 more pages in the second chapter than in the third chapter.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has a different number of pages as follows:  Chapter 1 - 53 pages, Chapter 2 - 75 pages, and Chapter 3 - 21 pages. Therefore, to find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 53 pages - 21 pages = 32 pages. So, there are 32 pages more in the first chapter than in the third chapter.;
Response:  If each chapter has 61 pages and there are 31 chapters in total, then the number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1931 pages.;
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book with a total of 23 pages. Then, we are told that the first chapter has 10 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the first chapter is 10.;
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 81 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:  Pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter  Pages = 2 x 81 Pages = 162 pages  Now, let's find out how many pages are in the second chapter. We know that the second chapter starts from page 68 and ends at page 149 (which is the end of the book). Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is:  Number of pages in second chapter = Ending page number - Starting page number  Number of pages in second chapter = 149 - 68  Number of pages in second chapter = 81 pages  So, there are 81 pages in the second chapter of the book.;
Response:  We know that 62 campers went for a morning rowing session and 39 of them went in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows: 62 - 39 = 23. Therefore, 23 campers went for an evening rowing session.;
"Response:  We know that 52 campers went out to sail in the morning and 61 campers visited during the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows:

Morning (52): 52 x 1 = 52
Afternoon (61): 61 - 52 = 9

Therefore, there were 9 more campers who went sailing in the afternoon than in the morning.";
Response:  If 15 campers went for an early morning rowing session and some more campers left for afternoon rowing, then we can assume that there were initially 15 + x campers who went for rowing in total. Here;x' represents the number of campers who went for afternoon rowing. Therefore, the total number of campers who went for rowing that day is 15 + x. Now, if 32 campers rowed that day, then we can say that the ratio of campers who went for rowing in the morning to those who went for rowing in the afternoon is: 15 : x. So, the value of 'x' can be found by dividing 32 by 15, which gives us x = 2. Therefore, the correct answer is: 32 - 15 = 17 campers went for rowing in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 7 camps were rowed in the afternoon and 60 campers were taken out for rowing that day. So if 60 campers went rowing in the morning, then we can assume that 60 / 7 = 8.57 (approximately) campers went rowing in the morning. Therefore, approximately 8.57 campers went rowing in the morning.;
Response:  We know that 36 campers went out in the morning and 13 campers went out in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went out during the day is: 36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, 49 campers went on an evening cruise.;
"Response:  We know that there were 44 campers in total and they went for a walk in the morning (jutros), afternoon (poslijepodne) and evening (navečer). So, we can calculate how many campers went for a walk during each time period as follows:
Morning (jutros): 39 - 44 = -5 camper(s) did not go for a walk in the morning.
Afternoon (poslijepodne): 44 - 39 = 5 camper(s) went for a walk in the afternoon.
Evening (navečer): 44 - 31 = 13 camper(s) went for a walk in the evening.
Therefore, the number of campers who went for a walk in the morning is -5, in the afternoon is 5, and in the evening is 13.";
"Response:  We know that 48 campers went in the afternoon and 49 campers went in the evening. So, if more campers went in the morning than in the evening, we can say that:

More campers (x) went to the morning session than to the evening session.

We are given that x = 53 - 48 = 5.

So, 5 more campers went to the morning session than to the evening session.";
Response:  We know that 33 campers went out in the morning, and 34 campers went out in the afternoon. So, there are more campers who went out in the afternoon than in the morning. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of campers who went out in the morning from the number of campers who went out in the afternoon: 34 - 33 = 1. Therefore, one camper more went out for rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.;
Response:  We know that 13 campers went fishing in the morning and 59 campers went hiking. So, altogether we have 72 campers who left early in the day (morning). Now, let's see how many campers went for a boat ride after lunchtime. According to the question, 21 campers went boating in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of campers who went boating is 21. Finally, we need to subtract the number of campers who went boating from the total number of campers who left early in the day. So, the number of campers who went fishing is: 72 - 21 = 51 campers.;
Response:  We know that 29 campers went fishing in the morning and 66 campers went hiking in the morning as well. Therefore, we can conclude that 35 campers (29 + 6) did not go fishing or hiking in the morning. Now, let's check how many campers went sailing in the afternoon: According to the question, 26 campers went sailing in the afternoon. So, the number of campers who went sailing is equal to the number of campers who did not go fishing or hiking in the morning minus the number of campers who went sailing in the afternoon: Number of campers who went sailing = 35 - 26 = 9 campers. Therefore, 9 campers went sailing in the afternoon.;
Response:  We know that 4 campera went hiking in the morning and 26 campers went fishing after noon. So, altogether we have 30 campers who went out for activities in one day. Now, let's calculate how many of them went to both fishing and hiking: To do this, we need to find out how many campers went to either fishing or hiking but not both. In other words, we subtract the number of campers who went only to fishing from those who went only to hiking: Number of campers who went only to fishing = 26 (from the question) - Number of campers who went only to hiking = 4 (from the question) Substituting these values into our equation above, we get: Total number of campers who went to both fishing and hiking = Total number of campers - Number of campers who went only to fishing - Number of campers who went only to hiking Total number of campers = 30 - 26 + 4 = 8 Therefore, 8 campers went to both fishing and hiking.;
Response:  We know that in total, 46 campers went for a boat ride during one day. Of those, 43 campers went for a boat ride in the morning and several more campers went for a boat ride in the afternoon. So, to find out how many campers went for a boat ride in the afternoon, we can subtract the number of campers who went for a boat ride in the morning from the total number of campers who went for a boat ride during the day:  Number of campers who went for a boat ride in the afternoon = Total number of campers - Number of campers who went for a boat ride in the morning  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of campers who went for a boat ride in the afternoon = 46 - 43  = 3  Therefore, three campers went for a boat ride in the afternoon.;
Response:  If Rachel has picked 4 apples from her tree and the tree had 7 apples in the beginning, then there are 3 (7 - 4) apples left on the tree. So, Rachel still has 3 apples on her tree.;
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples (jabuke). Then she picked one apple and now has 3 apples left on the tree (drtvo). So, Rachel collected 1 apple in total. Therefore, Rachel collected 1 + 4 = 5 apples.;
Response:  We know that Rachel already picked 7 ripe apples from her tree and now there are 5 remaining on the tree. So, if we subtract 7 from 5, we get 2. Therefore, there are 2 non-ripe apples left on the tree.;
Response:  If Rachel picked two mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 7 apples left, then initially the tree must have had 9 apples (7 + 2 = 9).;
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 6 mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 2 mature apples and 4 immature ones. So initially, the tree must have had 6 + 2 = 8 apples.;
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 2 mature apples and 27 immature apples. So, the total number of mature apples on the tree is 2 (the ones Rachel picked plus the new ones). Therefore, there are 29 non-mature apples on the tree (27 - 2 = 29).;
Response:  At first, Rachel had 7 jabukas on her tree. Then she picked 7 jabukas and left 2 new ones on the tree (which are now growing). So, after picking the jabukas, the tree had 6 jabukas remaining. Therefore, the correct answer is: 7 + 2 = 9.;
Response:  The tree had initially 2 apples. Then, Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree. After that, three new apples grew on the tree. So, in total, there are now 6 apples (2 + 4 + 3) on the tree. Therefore, there are 6 apples on the tree now.;
Response:  We know that Rachel had 52 apples in her tree and she picked two of them. So now she has 50 apples left (52 - 2 = 50). Then she picks some more apples from the same tree, leaving it with 7 apples remaining. To find out how many apples the tree had at first, we need to subtract the number of apples Rachel picked from the total number of apples the tree had initially. Therefore, the answer is 50 + 7 = 57 apples.;
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked up 8 jabukas from each of the three trees. So, she has collected in total 8 x 3 = 24 jabukas. Now, we are told that there were still 9 jabukas left on the trees after Rachel had picked some. Therefore, the initial number of jabukas on each tree was 9 - 8 = 1. So, the initial number of jabukas on all three trees combined was 3 x 1 = 3.;
Response:  Rachel has already picked up 7 jabukas from each of her 4 apple trees, so she has collected in total 7 x 4 = 28 jabukas. Therefore, there are still 29 - 28 = 1 more jabuka left on the trees. So, Rachel has collected a total of 28 + 1 = 29 jabukas.;
Response:  We know that Ed has 2 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed has x marbles and Doug has y marbles, then we can write an equation:  x = 2 + y. Since Doug lost some of his marbles on the playground, we know that x - y = 19 (the difference between Ed's number of marbles and Doug's). Solving for y (the number of marbles Doug had before he lost any), we get:  y = x - 19. Substituting this value back into our original equation, we find that Doug had 17 marbles before he lost any (x = 2 + 17):  x = 2 + 17 = 19. Therefore, Doug lost 2 marbles.;
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more kuglica than Doug. So if Doug had x kuglica, then Ed had x + 10 kuglica.  Since Doug lost 11 kuglica on the field, he now has x - 11 kuglica. Therefore, we can write an equation: x - 11 = (x + 10) - 11. Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 29. So, Ed had 39 kuglica more than Doug.;
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug initially. So if Ed has x marbles now, Doug must have y marbles now, where x - y = 6. Now we are told that Doug lost 7 of his marbles on the playground. Therefore, Doug now has x - 7 marbles. Since Ed had 22 marbles initially, and Ed still has all of them, Doug must have gained 22 - (x - 7) = 15 marbles. Thus, Doug has 15 + y = 22 marbles now. Solving for y, we get y = 7. So Doug has 15 marbles now.;
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 5 kuglica (the initial amount) and he lost some of them during the game. So, let's assume that Ed had x kuglica initially. Since Doug lost 3 kuglica, we can say that Doug started with x - 3 kuglica. Now, we are told that Ed had 27 kuglica in total, so the sum of all the kuglica Ed and Doug had is equal to 27: x + (x - 3) = 27. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. Therefore, Doug had 7 kuglica at the beginning of the game (x - 3).;
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. So if Doug had x marbles, then Ed had 24 + x marbles.  Since Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more, we can set up an equation:  Ed = Doug - (27) + (9).  Solving for Doug gives us:  Doug = Ed - (24) + (9) = 15.  Therefore, Ed had 9 more marbles than Doug.;
Response:  Ed had 29 more kuglica than Doug. If Ed lost 17 kuglica on the field, then he has fewer kuglica now. So, Ed has 29 - 17 = 12 more kuglica than Doug. Therefore, Ed has 31 kuglica more than Doug (Ed: 31, Doug: 0).;
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. So if Doug has x marbles, then Ed has 19 + x marbles. Since Ed lost some marbles on the playground, he now has fewer marbles than before. Let's say he lost y marbles. Then we can write an equation based on what we know:  Number of marbles Ed has = 19 + x - y (1) Now, we are told that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, number of marbles Doug has = x - 8 (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: Number of marbles Ed has = 19 + x - y - 8 (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: Number of marbles Ed has = 11x - 7y (4) Now, we want to find out how many marbles Ed lost. So, let's substitute y = 5 (the number of marbles Ed lost) into equation (4): Number of marbles Ed has = 11x - 7(5) = 11x - 35 (5) Therefore, Ed lost 5 marbles.;
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So if Ed has x marbles, then Doug has x - 30 marbles.  Since Ed lost 21 marbles on the field, he now has x - 21 marbles.  Therefore, Ed has 91 marbles (x - 21).;
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more kuglica than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 17 kuglica now and he lost 20 on the field, then Doug must have had 39 kuglica (17 - 20 = 39).;
Response:  We know that there are 408 students who have suggested adding potatoes to their menu and 42 students who have suggested adding saltines. So, we can write this as an equation: 408 + 42 = x, where x is the number of students who have suggested adding potatoes. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 42 from both sides of the equation: 408 - 42 = x. Simplifying, we get: x = 366. Therefore, more than three times as many students (366) have suggested adding potatoes compared to those who have suggested adding saltines (12).;
"Response:  We know that 479 students have suggested adding potatoes to their menu and 489 students have suggested adding saltines. So, we can write this as:

Number of students who suggested adding saltines = 489 - Number of students who suggested adding potatoes
= 489 - 479
= 10
Therefore, 10 more students suggested adding saltines than those who suggested adding potatoes.";
Response:  We know that out of 310 students, 185 students suggested adding potatoes to their menu, and 65 students suggested adding saltine crackers. So, we can conclude that 185 + 65 = 250 students suggested some type of savory snack or side dish. Therefore, the number of students who did not suggest any savory snacks is 310 - 250 = 60 students.;
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding salt to their menu, which means that 104 students did not suggest adding salt.  Now, we are asked how many students suggested adding pepper. Unfortunately, the question does not provide enough information to determine this. Therefore, I cannot give an exact answer and would need further clarification or additional data to do so.;
Response:  If 457 students have suggested adding potatoes and 63 more than that suggest adding saltines, then we can say that 457 + 63 = x, where x is the total number of students who have suggested adding something to their menu. Since there are only two options (potatoes or saltines), we know that x must be either 457 or 63 plus some other value. Therefore, the correct answer is 457.;
Response:  If 182 students have proposed adding potatoes to the menu and 166 students have proposed adding salt more than those who proposed adding potatoes, then we can say that the number of students who proposed adding salt is equal to 166 - 182 = 54. Therefore, there are 54 students who proposed adding salt more than those who proposed adding potatoes.;
Response:  We know that there are 324 students who suggested adding krumpi to the menu, 374 students who suggested adding salted food to the menu, and 128 students who suggested adding pepper to the menu. So, in total, we have: 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students who participated in suggesting new dishes.;
"Response:  We know that 257 students suggested adding potatoes to their menu, while 120 suggested adding salt, and 97 suggested adding peas. So, we can write this as an equation: 257 + 120 = x + 97 where ""x"" represents the number of students who suggested adding salt. Now, we are asked how many more students suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt. Therefore, we need to subtract the two numbers: 257 - (120 + 97) =? = 63. So, there were 63 more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt.";
Response:  We know that there are 144 students who have suggested adding pirka crumpir to their menu, and 79 of them have also suggested adding paradeja. So, the total number of students who have suggested adding some type of vegetable is 223 (144 + 79). On the other hand, we know that 467 students have suggested adding saltine to their menu. Therefore, the difference between the number of students who have suggested adding saltine and those who have suggested adding some type of vegetable is 244 (467 - 223). Finally, since 144 students have suggested adding pirka crumpir, the number of students who have suggested adding it more than any other item is 144 / (244 - 223) = 15/21 or approximately 0.68.;
Response:  We know that out of 228 students who suggested adding potatoes to their menu, 337 students suggested adding salt to their menu. So, we can say that for every student who suggested adding potatoes, there are 1.5 times as many students who suggested adding salt (since 337 / 228 = 1.5). Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding salt than suggested adding parade. Since only 23 students suggested adding parade, and 337 students suggested adding salt, we can say that the number of students who suggested adding salt is 337 - 23 = 314 more than the number of students who suggested adding parade. Therefore, the answer is 314.;
Response:  We know that there are 66 options for food in total and 450 students have suggested adding some new items to the menu. So, we can say that 450/66 = x, where x is the number of students who did not suggest any new item. Therefore, the number of students who suggested at least one new item is 66 - x.;
Response:  If 218 students have suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 351 students have suggested adding only saltine crackers, then there are in total 569 students who have made suggestions for the menu (218 + 351 = 569).;
"Response:  We know that out of 269 students who suggested adding salt, 330 students suggested adding potatoes and 76 students suggested adding apples. So, we have:

Number of students suggesting salt = 269
Number of students suggesting potatoes = 330
Number of students suggesting apples = 76

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested potatoes than suggested salt:

Number of students suggesting potatoes - Number of students suggesting salt = 330 - 269 = 61

So, there are 61 more students who suggested adding potatoes than suggested adding salt.";
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if we have x number of boys and y number of girls, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of boys = x  Number of girls = y  Now, according to the question, the total number of students is equal to 569 (girls) + 236 (boys). Therefore, we can set up another equation:  Total number of students = x + y  Substituting the values from the first two equations, we get:  Total number of students = 569 + 236  = 780  Since there are more girls than boys in the school, we know that x < y. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of girls in the school is greater than or equal to the number of boys. So, the answer is:  More than 236 boys.;
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 841 - 34  Number of boys = 796  Therefore, there are 796 more boys than girls in the school.;
Response:  If there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls, then the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. So, there are 253 boys in that school.;
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 697 girls and 228 fewer boys, then there must be 469 boys in the school. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) = 635 + (510 - 635) = 485 Therefore, there are 485 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 868 girls and 787 boys, then we can say that x is greater than 0 (where x represents the number of boys). Now, let's use the information provided in the question to find out how many students are in total at this school. According to the question, the total number of students is equal to 868 + 787 = 1655. Therefore, we have: x + (x - 281) = 1655. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 1655. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 827. So, there are 827 students in this school, including 868 girls and 787 boys.;
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we have x number of girls, then we have x + 142 = 842 (total number of students) boys. Therefore, x = 698.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. Then, another 418 girls joined the school. So, the total number of students in the school is: 706 + 222 = 928.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school, so now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, there are 946 girls in the school right now.;
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in school. If 465 girls joined the school, then we can calculate how many more girls than boys there are as follows: Number of girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 Number of boys = 410 Therefore, there are 1097 girls and 410 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, another 682 girls joined the school, so now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school right now.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in the school and later 910 boys joined the school. So, the total number of boys in the school is:  Initially = 214 + Later = 910 = 1124 boys. Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 36 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 626 / 36 = 17.5.;
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is: 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in the school overall. According to the question, there are 772 teachers at the school. Therefore, the total number of people (students plus teachers) in the school is: 624 + 772 = 1396.;
Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then we can say that the number of boys is less than half the total number of students. So, if there are 402 girls and 739 boys, then the number of boys must be less than half of 402, which is equal to 201. Therefore, there are 201 boys in this school.;
"Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys is less than half the total number of students. So we can write an equation based on this information: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Now we know that there are 458 more girls than boys in the school, so we can substitute these values into our equation: Number of boys = Total number of students - (458 + Number of girls) Substituting the given value for ""Number of girls"", which is 692, we get: Number of boys = Total number of students - (458 + 692) = 1340 - 1140 = 200 Therefore, there are 200 boys in the school.";
Response:  We know that there are currently 362 boys and 257 girls in school. Additionally, another 403 girls have joined the school. So, if we add these numbers together, we get:  Boys = 362 + 403 = 765 Girls = 257 + 403 = 650 Therefore, there are more girls than boys at the school.;
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $2 left ( $18 - $16 = $2). So, Edward currently has $2 in cash.;
Response:  If Edward had $13 and spent some money, then he has less money now. So, if he has $3 left, he must have spent $10. Therefore, Edward spent $10.;
Response:  If Edward spent $9 first and then $8 more, he will have $9 + $8 = $17 left after spending that amount. So, before spending any money, Edward had $17 - $9 = $8.;
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so each book cost him $0.17 (16 / 92). Now we are told that he has $6 left after buying the books. So, before spending the money on the books, Edward had $6 + $0.17 = $6.17.;
"Response:  If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books and he has $12 left after buying them, then we can write an equation as follows:

$6 = x + y (where x is the cost of one book)

Since Edward has $12 left after buying the books, we know that $12 - $6 = x + y, where x is the cost of one book and y is the number of books bought.

Solving for x, we get:

x = $12 - $6 = $6

So, each book costs $6.";
Response:  If Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, he has $19 left after spending that amount. So, before spending any money, Edward had $19 + $6 = $25.;
Response:  If Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, then he has $12 left after buying those items. So, the total amount that Edward spent on books is $4 + $3 = $7.;
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he has $19 left after buying those things. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had left: $$ \therefore \text {More spent on books} = \$ 19 - \$ 8 = \$ 11 $$ Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens.;
Response:  Before he spent his money, Edward had $24 (17 + 10). So, he had $24 before spending any money.;
Response:  We know that Zachary has made 44 movements and David has made 58 more than Zachary. So, if we add both numbers together, we get: 44 + (58 - 44) = 102. Therefore, Zachary and David have together made 102 movements.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 blocks and David made 44 blocks. So, we can write this as an equation: 51 = x where x is the number of blocks David made. Now, we can solve for x: x = 51 - 44 = 7 Therefore, Zachary made 7 more blocks than David.;
Response:  We know that David made 44 movements and Zachary made 35 movements less than him (David - 35 = Zachary). So, Zachary made 9 movements more than David (Zachary - 35 = 9 + 35 = 44). Therefore, Zachary made 44 - 9 = 35 movements more than David.;
Response:  We know that David has done 51 push-ups and he is 49 more than Zachary. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get: 51 + (49 = 100). Therefore, David and Zachary have together performed 100 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary has made 59 moves and David has made 19 more than Zachary. So, David has made 59 + 19 = 78 moves.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 movements and David made 29 more movements than Zachary. So, David made 44 + 29 = 73 movements.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 53 movements and David made 17 more movements than Zachary. So, David made 53 + 17 = 70 movements in total. Now we need to find out how many crunches Zachary did. Since he made 14 fewer sklekovanja than David, Zachary did 70 - 14 = 56 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 56 crunches.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 35 skleks and David made 58 more skleks than Zachary. So, if Zachary made x skleks, then David made x + 58 skleks. Now we are told that David made 87 fewer skleks than Zachary. This means that David made (x - 87) skleks. Therefore, Zachary made 35 + (x - 87) = 42 skleks more than Crunch.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 pull-ups and 58 push-ups. So he did 94 exercises in total (46 + 58 = 104). Now we need to find out how many more or fewer crunches Zachary did than David. According to the question, David did 38 more crunches than Zachary. Therefore, if Zachary did x crunches, then David did x + 38 crunches. So, Zachary did 104 - 38 = 66 crunches more than David.;
Response:  We know that David has made 39 more skunks than Zachary. So, if Zachary had made x skunks, then David would have made 39 + x skunks. Since John has made 13 fewer skunks than David, we can say that John has made 39 - 13 = 26 skunks less than David. Therefore, David has made 39 + x - 26 = 65 skunks more than Zachary.;
Response:  We know that Zachary has made 51 moves and David has made 74 moves more than Zachary. So, David has made 51 + 74 = 125 moves in total. Now we are told that John has made 4 fewer moves than David. Therefore, John has made 125 - 4 = 121 moves.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 15 boxes and David made 39 more than Zachary. So, David made 39 + 15 = 54 boxes in total. Since John worked 9 fewer boxes than David, John made 54 - 9 = 45 boxes. Therefore, Zachary made 45 - 15 = 30 more boxes than John.;
"Response:  If David made 30 more baskets than Zachary, that means Zachary made x baskets. Since David made 37 baskets in total, we can write an equation:

David made 37 baskets = Zachary made + 30 baskets

Now we need to solve for ""x"", which is the number of baskets Zachary made. We know that David made 37 - 30 = 7 more baskets than Zachary, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

David made 37 baskets = Zachary made + 30 baskets
= Zachary made + 7 baskets

Now we have two equations:

Zachary made x baskets (from the first equation)
Zachary made + 7 baskets = 37 baskets (from the second equation)

We can now use substitution or elimination method to solve for ""x"". Let's use substitution method here. Solving for ""x"" in the first equation, we get:

x = 37 - 30
= 7

So Zachary made 7 baskets.";
"Response:  We know that David made 56 more baskets than Zachary. So if they together made x baskets, then we can write an equation as follows:
David made 56 more baskets = (x - Zachary's number of baskets)
We are given that Zachary made 40 baskets. Substituting this value into the above equation, we get:
56 + (x - 40) = x
Now, simplify the equation:
26 = x
Therefore, David and Zachary together made 26 baskets.";
Response:  We know that David made more than Zachary did because he made 40 more skunks than Zachary did. So if Zachary made x skunk, then David made x + 40 = 80 skunks. Therefore, David made 80 skunks.;
Response:  David made 36 more boxes than Zachary did today during training. So if Zachary made 58 boxes and 33 crunches, then David made 20 (58 - 33) more boxes than crunches. Therefore, David made 20 + 33 = 53 more boxes than crunches.;
Response:  If David made 27 more baskets than Zachary, that means Zachary made x fewer baskets than David. Since David made 34 baskets in total (27 + 7), and Zachary made x - 7 baskets in total. So, we can write an equation: 34 = x - 7. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. We know that Zachary made 5 baskets, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 34 = x - 7. Substituting x = 28, we get: 34 = 28. Therefore, Zachary made 6 more baskets than David.;
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 5 pages of her homework in mathematics and 2 pages of her homework in reading. So, we can write this as:
Mathematics: 5 pages
Reading: 2 pages
Now, let's compare these two quantities to find out which one is greater. Mathematics has 5 pages more than Reading, so we can say that:
Greater quantity = Mathematics (by 5 pages)
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Rachel had more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading, with 5 pages more in mathematics.";
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 3 pages of her homework in mathematics and 4 pages of her homework in reading. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Mathematics = 3 pages Reading = 4 pages Now, let's solve for the number of pages more than Rachel had in reading: Number of pages more = Reading - Mathematics = 4 pages - 3 pages = 1 page Therefore, Rachel had 1 page more in reading than in mathematics.;
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of homework in mathematics and additional pages for reading, then she had to complete a total of 7 pages of homework. So, if she completed x pages of reading homework, then she did not complete the full 7 pages of reading homework. Therefore, the answer is x < 7.;
Response:  We know that Rachel finished 7 pages of her homework in mathematics and she had to finish 4 more pages than the number of pages she finished for reading comprehension. So if she finished x pages of reading comprehension, then she would have to finish 4 + x pages of homework in mathematics. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: 7 = x + (4 + x) Substituting the value of x from the problem statement into this equation gives us: 7 = x + 4x Solving for x, we get: x = 3 So Rachel had to finish 3 pages more of homework in mathematics than she finished for reading comprehension.;
Response:  We know that Rachel finished 8 pages of her homework in math and she had to finish 3 more pages than her homework from reading. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pages Rachel finished = 8 + (Number of pages from reading - 3)  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Number of pages Rachel finished = 8 + (-3)  Simplifying the equation:  Number of pages Rachel finished = 11  Therefore, Rachel finished 11 pages of her homework in total.;
Response:  If Rachel finished 8 pages of homework from mathematics, and she needed to finish 6 more pages than the number of pages she finished in mathematics, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages Rachel finished = Number of pages she needed to finish + 6  In this case, if Rachel finished 8 pages of homework from mathematics, then the number of pages she needed to finish is equal to 8 + 6 = 14 pages. So, Rachel needed to finish 14 pages of additional homework from mathematics.;
"Response:  If Rachel finished 10 pages of her homework in mathematics, and she needed to finish 3 more pages than that, then we can say that... See full solution

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If Rachel finished 10 pages of her homework in mathematics, and she needed to finish 3 more pages than that, then we can say that:

Rachel finished x pages of her homework in mathematics.
We know that x + 3 = 13 (since Rachel finished 10 pages and needed to finish 3 more).
Solving for x, we get:
x = 9.
Therefore, Rachel finished 9 pages of her homework in mathematics beyond what was required.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to finish 2 pages of her homework from mathematics. Therefore, she needs to finish 2 x 4 = 8 pages of her homework in total.  Next, we are given that she also has to finish 3 pages of her homework from reading. So, she needs to finish 3 + 8 = 11 pages of her homework in total. Finally, we are told that she has to finish 10 pages of her homework from biology. Thus, the total number of pages Rachel needs to finish is 11 + 10 = 21 pages.;
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 9 pages of her homework in mathematics, 2 pages of her homework in reading, and 96 pages of her homework in biology. To find out how many more pages she completed in mathematics than in reading, we need to subtract the number of pages she completed in reading from the total number of pages she completed in mathematics. So, if she completed 9 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages of homework in reading, then the difference between these two numbers is 7 (9 - 2). Therefore, Rachel completed 7 more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading.;
"Response:  We know that Rachel completed 11 pages of her homework in mathematics and 3 pages in biology. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Mathematics = 11
Biology = 3
Now, let's solve for the difference between the number of pages completed in mathematics and biology:
Difference = Mathematics - Biology
= 11 - 3
= 8
Therefore, there are 8 more pages in the homework assignment from mathematics than from biology.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel completed 7 pages of her homework in mathematics and 11 pages in reading. Therefore, the total number of pages she completed is: 7 + 11 = 18 pages. Next, we are told that she also completed 8 pages of her homework in biology. So, the total number of pages she completed is now: 18 + 8 = 26 pages. Finally, we can see that there were more pages in the biology assignment than in the other two subjects, so the difference between the number of pages in biology and the number of pages in the other two subjects is: 26 - (7 + 11) = 26 - 18 = 8 pages. Therefore, the answer to the question is 8 pages.;
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 9 pages of her homework from mathematics and 11 pages from reading. So, in total she needs to finish 9 + 11 = 20 pages of her homework. However, we are also given that she has already finished 29 pages of her homework from biology. Therefore, the remaining amount of pages for her to finish is 20 - 29 = -9 pages. Since it is not possible to have negative pages, we can conclude that Rachel did not need to finish any more pages of her homework from mathematics or reading.;
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 8 pages of her homework from mathematics and 3 pages from biology. So, in total she needs to finish 11 pages (8 + 3).;
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 5 pages of homework from mathematics and 10 pages of homework from reading. Therefore, she needs to finish 15 pages of homework in total. However, we are also given that she has to complete an additional 6 pages of homework from biology. So, in total, Rachel needs to finish 21 pages of homework (15 + 6).;
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 2 pages of home reading and 4 pages of home math work. So, we have:
Home Reading: 2 pages = 2 x (number of pages in one book)
Home Math Work: 4 pages = 4 x (number of pages in one book)
We don't know how many pages are in each book, so let's assume that there are 10 pages in each book. Then, we can calculate as follows:
Home Reading: 2 pages / 10 pages per book = 0.2 pages or 20% complete
Home Math Work: 4 pages / 10 pages per book = 0.4 pages or 40% complete
Therefore, Rachel was 40% complete with her homework in mathematics and 20% complete with her homework in reading.";
Response:  We know that Rachel had to finish 4 pages of home reading in mathematics and 7 pages of home reading in literature. Therefore, she had to finish a total of 4 + 7 = 11 pages of homework. Now we are asked how many more pages of domestic work in mathematics there were than in literature. To find this difference, we subtract the number of pages in literature from the total number of pages of homework: 11 - 7 = 4 pages. So, there were 4 more pages of domestic work in mathematics than in literature.;
Response:  Ujutro (morning) Jack received 6 emails and Popodne (afternoon) he received 2 more emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails during these two time periods.;
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 emails and at afternoon he received 8 emails. So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is:  6 - 8 = -2 emails. Therefore, Jack received fewer emails in the afternoon than in the morning.;
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more after noon, then he received a total of 5 emails during the day. So, the answer is 5.;
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 11 emails that day. Therefore, Jack has received 11 emails per day.;
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 72 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 77 emails (5 + 72). Therefore, Jack has received 77 emails in total - 39 emails in the morning and 38 emails in the evening.;
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 12 emails. Therefore, the answer is 12.;
Response:  Ujutro (morning) - Jack received 3 emails.  Popodne (afternoon) - Jack did not receive any emails because it is mentioned that he already received 3 emails in the morning.  Navječer (evening) - Jack received 8 emails. Therefore, Jack has received a total of 3 + 0 + 8 = 11 emails.;
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in total. So, he received x emails at 7 am and y emails at 5 pm. Since we know that x + y = 10, we can write the equation as follows:
x + y = 10... (1)
We also know that x > 0 because Jack received some emails at 7 am. Therefore, we can rewrite equation (1) as:
x > 0... (2)
Now, let's solve for x and y using these two equations. We know that x is greater than 0, so we can ignore the left-hand side of equation (2). Using equation (1), we get:
y = 10 - x... (3)
Since Jack received more emails in the evening than in the morning, we know that y > x. Substituting this value into equation (3), we get:
y > 10 - x... (4)
Now, we have two inequalities:
(1) x + y = 10
(2) y > 10 - x
Can you use these inequalities to find the values of x and y?";
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, he received more emails in the morning than in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the evening is:  9 - 7 = 2.  Hence, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the evening.;
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 5 emails in the afternoon, and 4 emails in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of:  10 + 5 + 4 = 19 emails during the day (morning and afternoon). So, he received more emails in the morning than in the evening.;
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and then he received some more emails later that day. So, let's say he received X additional emails after noon. Then, we know that Jack received a total of 6 + X emails during the day. Since the question asks how many emails Jack received between 3 pm and midnight, we can conclude that X = 4 (since there are 4 hours between 3 pm and midnight). Therefore, Jack received a total of 6 + 4 = 10 emails during the day.;
Response:  Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 67 messages (3 + 64 = 67). Then, he received 5 more emails and 54 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 121 messages (5 + 54 = 121). Therefore, Jack received an average of 67 / 2 = 33.5 emails per day.;
Response:  Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 16 messages (9 + 7 = 16). Therefore, Jack received 16 messages on that day.;
Response:  Yesterday morning (ujutro), Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. Then he didn't receive any new emails or letters until after lunchtime (popodne). So during this time, he received 3 more emails and 44 more letters. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is 7 (10 - 3 = 7). Similarly, the difference between the number of letters Jack received in the morning and the number of letters he received in the afternoon is 36 (12 - 44 = -36).;
Response:  Yesterday morning (ujutro), Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. Then he received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon (popodne). So, the total number of emails Jack received yesterday is: 6 + 2 = 8 emails. The total number of letters Jack received yesterday is: 8 + 7 = 15 letters. Therefore, Jack received more letters than emails yesterday.;
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and sent 91 emails that day. So he received an average of 6/2 = 3 emails per hour. Then, he received 2 more emails after lunch and sent 74 emails, so he received an average of 2/2 = 1 email per hour after lunch. Therefore, Jack received a total of 3 + 1 = 4 emails per day.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters, so he sent 4 + 2 = 6 emails that day. Then in the afternoon, he received 6 emails and sent 8 letters, so he sent 6 + 8 = 14 emails that day. Therefore, Jack sent 6 emails in the morning and 14 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 20 emails sent that day.;
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and then additional emails later in the day, we can assume that he received an equal number of emails after lunchtime as he did before lunchtime. Therefore, if Jack received 7 emails in the morning, he must have received another 7 emails after lunchtime, for a total of 14 emails received during the day (7 + 7 = 14). So, Jack received a total of 14 emails during the day.;
Response:  Ujutro, Jack received 3 emails. Popodne, he received 5 emails. So, in total, Jack has received 3 + 5 = 8 emails that day. Therefore, Jack has received more emails in the evening than in the morning by 8 - 3 = 5 emails.;
Response:  Jack received 3 emails after noon, so he received a total of 3 + 3 = 6 emails that day.;
Response:  We know that the snake (štakor) jumped 9 inches and the frog (žaba) jumped 12 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped beyond the snake, we can subtract the distance the snake jumped from the distance the frog jumped:  Distance = Frog's jump - Snake's jump  Distance = 12 inches - 9 inches  Distance = 3 inches  So, the frog jumped 3 inches beyond the snake.;
"Response:  We know that the length of one inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters (cm). So, if we convert the distances given in inches to cm, we get:

* Štakor skočio 31 inča = 31 x 2.54 = 78.4 cm
* Žaba skočila 35 inča = 35 x 2.54 = 90.6 cm

Now, let's add the distance each animal jumped:

Total distance = 78.4 + 90.6 = 169 cm

Therefore, together they have jumped 169 cm or 169 inča.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog (žaba) has jumped 17 inches beyond the skaters (skakavci). So, if the skater had jumped 36 inches, then the frog would have jumped 36 + 17 = 53 inches. Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog is 53 inches.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the stork jumped 25 inches (63 cm). Then, the frog jumped 18 inches (46 cm) beyond the skaters, and the mouse jumped 2 inches (5 cm) beyond the frog. So, the total distance traveled by the mouse is:  Distance = 2 + 18 = 20 inches (51 cm). Therefore, the mouse has traveled 20 inches or 51 cm.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the stork jumped 30 cm. Then, the frog jumped 10 inches (which is equal to 25 cm) beyond the stork's distance. Finally, the mouse jumped 20 inches (which is equal to 51 cm) beyond the frog's distance. So, the total distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is:  Distance = 30 + 25 + 51 = 106 cm. Therefore, the mouse has traveled 106 cm beyond the starting point.;
"Response:  We know that:

* The distance that the frog jumped is 39 inches (or 94 cm) less than the distance that the mouse jumped.
* The distance that the snake jumped is 30 cm.

So we can write an equation based on these two pieces of information:

Distance = 39 - x
where x is the distance that the mouse jumped.

We are also given that the mouse jumped 94 cm less than the distance that the snake jumped. So we can substitute this value into our equation:

Distance = 39 - (94 - x)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use algebra to solve for x, which is the distance that the frog jumped?";
"Response:  We know that:

* The stork jumped 25 inches (stork = 25)
* The frog jumped 32 inches further than the skaters (frog = 32 + x)
* The mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog (mouse = 32 - x)

We can write an equation based on these statements:

Stork + Frog = Mouse

Substituting the values given in the problem:

25 + (32 + x) = 26 - x

Simplifying and solving for x:

x = 7

So, the mouse jumped 7 inches.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the stork and the frog is 24 inches. Then, we are told that the frog jumped 33 inches beyond the stork. So, the total distance traveled by the frog is 33 + 24 = 57 inches. Finally, we learn that the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so the distance traveled by the mouse is 57 - 5 = 52 inches. Therefore, the answer to the question is 52 inches.;
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 5 cm further than the snake. So, if the snake jumped 13 inches (which is equal to 33 cm), then the frog jumped 33 + 5 = 38 cm. Therefore, the frog jumped 38 cm.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 10 cm further than the snake. So, if the snake jumped x inches (in), then the frog jumped x + 10 cm.  We are also given that the snake jumped 35 inches. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both the snake and the frog together is equal to the sum of their individual jumps: x + (x + 10) = 35. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 10 = 35. Solving for x, we find that the snake jumped 17 inches (in). Now, since the frog jumped 10 cm further than the snake, the frog jumped 17 in + 10 = 27 cm.;
"Response:  We know that:

* The distance between the starting point and where the frog jumped is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the snake (30 cm) and the mouse (20 cm). Therefore, we can write: Distance = 30 + 20 = 50 cm.
* Since the frog jumped further than the snake, it means that its distance from the starting point is greater than 30 cm. So, let's call this distance x. Then, we have: Distance = 50 - x.
* Now, we are told that the frog jumped 10 cm more than the mouse. This means that if the mouse had jumped x cm, then the frog would have jumped x + 10 cm.
* Finally, since the frog was closer to the finish line than either the snake or the mouse, we know that x < 50.

So, putting all these pieces together, we get:
x = 40 cm.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the starting point and where the snake stopped is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by each animal plus the distance traveled by the mouse.  Therefore, if the snake skidded 39 inches, then it must have moved 39 - 19 = 20 inches from its original position.  Now, let's calculate how far the mouse has moved. Since the mouse skidded 12 inches less than the snake, the mouse moved 20 - 12 = 8 inches from its original position. So, the mouse skidded 8 inches.;
"Response:  We know that:

* The stork jumped 21 inches (53 cm) further than the frog.
* The mouse jumped 16 inches (40 cm) less than the frog.

So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the stork jumped x + 21 inches and the mouse jumped x - 16 inches.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

stork = frog + 21
mouse = frog - 16

Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:

stork = 37 inches (94 cm)
mouse = 21 inches (53 cm)

Therefore, the stork jumped 37 inches (94 cm) further than the mouse.";
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the skier jumped 17 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped compared to the skier, we need to divide the distance the frog jumped by twice the distance the skier jumped. So, if the frog jumped 39 inches and the skier jumped 17 inches, then the ratio of their jumps is 39/2(17) = 39/34 = 1.14. Therefore, the frog jumped 14% farther than the skier.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 20 cm. Then, according to the problem, the mouse was 10 cm less than the distance traveled by the frog. So, if the frog jumped 20 cm, then the mouse jumped 10 cm less than that, which is 10 - 10 = 0 cm. Therefore, the mouse did not jump at all!;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the stork and the frog is equal to 14 inches (since the stork skoche...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Firstly, we know that the distance between the stork and the frog is equal to 14 inches (since the stork skoche 14 inch). Then, we are told that the mouse skoche 16 inches less than the frog. So, if the frog skoche x inches, then the mouse skoche x - 16 inches. Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the skakač is equal to x + 16 inches. Now, we are also given that the frog skoche 37 inches further than the skakač. So, the total distance between the mouse and the skakač is equal to x + 16 inches + 37 inches = 53 inches. Hence, the distance between the mouse and the skakač is 53 inches.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 schnapps of bratwurst to the dough and now she needs to add more. The recipe requires 9 schnapps of bratwurst (14 - 5 = 9). So we need to add 9 schnapps of bratwurst to the dough.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 shells of butter to the dough. So, we need to find out how many shells of sugar she needs to add now. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of shells of sugar = Total amount of sugar required / Amount of sugar used so far. In this case, the total amount of sugar required is 11 shells (since the recipe calls for 11 shells of sugar), and the amount of sugar used so far is 4 shells (since Mary has already added 4 shells of butter). Therefore, we can calculate the number of shells of sugar needed as follows: Number of shells of sugar = 11 - 4 = 7 shells. So, Mary needs to add 7 more shells of sugar to the dough.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already put some of the batter in the pan and we need to find out how much more she needs to add based on the recipe given.  The recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. Since Mary has already added some batter, let's assume she has added x amount of batter so far (where x is an unknown quantity).  To find out how much more batter Mary needs to add, we can use the following equation:

Total amount of batter needed = Total amount of flour required - Amount of batter already added
= 6 cups - x cups

Since the total amount of flour required is 6 cups, and Mary has already added x cups, the difference between these two quantities is equal to the amount of batter Mary still needs to add:

Amount of batter still needed = Total amount of flour required - Amount of batter already added
= 6 cups - x cups

Now, we are given that Mary has already added 2 cups of batter, so we can substitute this value into the above equation:

Amount of batter still needed = 6 cups - 2 cups
= 4 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 cups of batter more to complete the recipe.";
Response:  If Mary has already put in two spoons of butter (which is equal to 2/11 of the total amount needed), then she still needs to put in 9/11 = 8.18 spoons of butter more. So, Mary has put in 2 + 8.18 = 10.18 spoons of butter so far.;
"Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour (which is equal to 240 grams), and the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar (which is equal to 550 grams), then we can calculate how many more cups of flour she needs to add:

Number of remaining cups of flour = Total amount of flour required - Amount of flour already added
= 550 g - 240 g
= 310 g

So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour (or 310 grams) to complete the recipe.";
Response:  If Mary has already put in 4 spoons of butter (which is equal to 1/3 of the total amount needed), then she still needs to add another 8 spoons of butter (which is equal to 2/3 of the remaining amount). So, if she has already added 4 spoons, then she still needs to add 8 more spoons. Therefore, the answer is 8.;
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and we have already added 3 cups (3 x 140g = 420g). So, to find out how many more cups of flour are needed, we need to subtract the amount we have already added from the total required amount: 9 - 420 = 380 g. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 380 grams of flour to make the torta.;

Mary is making a cake and the recipe requires 5 cups of flour. She has already added 3 cups of flour and wants to know how much more she needs to add. Can you help her calculate the amount?";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 schnapps to the mixture and the recipe requires 12 schnaps for total of 49 schnaps. So we need to add one more schnaps to complete the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 13.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 schnapps of bratwurst to the recipe and we need to find out how many more she needs to add.  To do this, we can use the following formula:

Number of schnapps needed = Total amount of schnapps required - Amount already added
= 10 shillings - 7 shillings
= 3 shillings

So, Mary needs to add an additional 3 shillings of bratwurst to the recipe.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of bratwurst to her recipe, which means she needs 10 more cups (12 - 2 = 10) of bratwurst to complete the recipe. Since each cup of bratwust contains 8 ounces or 226 grams, we can calculate how many ounces or grams of bratwurst Mary still needs as follows:

10 cups x 8 oz/cup = 80 oz or 2260 grams

Now, since the recipe requires 12 cups of flour and Mary has already added 2 cups, she needs 10 more cups of flour (12 - 2 = 10). Each cup of flour contains 4 ounces or 113 grams, so we can calculate how many ounces or grams of flour Mary still needs as follows:

10 cups x 4 oz/cup = 40 oz or 1130 grams

Finally, we need to determine how much salt Mary should add based on the amount of bratwurst and flour she has used so far. The recipe calls for 14 cups of sugar, but since Mary has only added 2 cups so far, she needs 12 more cups of sugar (14 - 2 = 12). However, since each cup of sugar contains 8 ounces or 226 grams, we can calculate how many ounces or grams of sugar Mary still needs as follows:

12 cups x 8 oz/cup = 96 oz or 2590 grams

Therefore, to answer your question, Mary needs an additional 80 oz or 2260 grams of bratwurst, 40 oz or 1130 grams of flour, and 96 oz or 2590 grams of sugar.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 schnapps to the dough and now she needs to add more. The recipe requires 8 schnaps for every 7 salt. So we need to find out how many schnaps are needed to make up for the difference between what Mary has already added (5) and what is required in the recipe (8). To do this, we divide the amount of salt (7) by the number of schnaps required per salt (8): 7 / 8 = 0.875. Since you can not add half a schnaps, we round up to the nearest whole number which gives us 1 additional schnaps. Therefore, Mary should add 1 extra schnaps to the dough.;
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 12 cups of sugar and she has already added 2 cups. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to be added. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (12) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2): 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 shalices of sugar to the dough and now she needs to add more. To find out how many more shalces of sugar she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (9 shalces) by the amount of sugar she has already added (4 shalces). So, the number of additional shalces of sugar needed is: 9 - 4 = 5 shalces. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 5 shalces of sugar to the dough.;
Response:  We know that we have already added 2 shalices of butter and now we need to find out how many more shalces of butter do we need to add. So, if we divide the total amount of sugar (6) by the amount of sugar used so far (2), we get 3. Then, if we multiply this number by the remaining amount of butter (9), we get 27. Therefore, we need to add 27 more shalces of butter to complete the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 schnapps to the dough and the recipe requires 5 times as much sugar as flour. So we need to calculate how many schnaps she needs to add now.  To do this, we can multiply the amount of flour (in this case, 14) by 5, which gives us 70. Since Mary has already added 11, we need to subtract 11 from 70, which leaves us with 59. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 59 schnaps to the dough.;
"Response:  If Mary has already put down some amount of batter (let's call it x), then we know that she needs to make y more batter to complete the recipe. Since the recipe requires 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour, we can write the equation:

x + y = 3(cups of sugar) - 10(cups of flour)

Now, since Mary has already put down some batter, let's say x = 2 cups, so now we have:

y = 3(cups of sugar) - 10(cups of flour) - 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y = 9 cups of flour - 3 cups of sugar

So, if Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than she has already used, then she needs 4 cups of flour (since 9 - 3 = 6).";
"Response:  If Mary has already put aside some of the flour (we don't know how much), and the recipe requires 13 cups of flour in total, then we can calculate how many cups of flour are left to be made as follows:

Total amount of flour required = 13 cups
Amount of flour already used =? ( unknown)

So, the number of cups of flour remaining to be made is equal to:

Number of cups of flour remaining = Total amount of flour required - Amount of flour already used
= 13 cups -? (unknown)

We are given that Mary has put aside ""par"" (unspecified amount) of brains, so we cannot determine exactly how much she has used until we know what ""par"" means. Therefore, we will use an educated guess or estimate based on the context of the problem. For example, if ""par"" means ""a little bit,"" then we might assume that Mary has used about half of the available flour, which would mean that there are 6.5 cups of flour remaining to be made (rounded down from 7).

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Mary still needs 6.5 cups of flour to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour.  Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. So we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 6 - 7 = -1 cup of flour needed. Since it is not possible to have negative amounts of an ingredient, we can conclude that Mary does not need to add any more flour. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 additional cups of flour.;

"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 3 cups of sugar, 10 cups of flour, and 15 cups of salt. Since Mary has already added 6 cups of flour, we need to find out how much more she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount required (3 + 10 + 15) by the amount she has already added (6):

(3 + 10 + 15) / 6 = 20 / 6 = 3

So, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour to make the torta according to the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 schnapps of bratwurst to the mixture. To find out how many more schnapps she needs to add, we can use the following formula: Number of schnapps = Total amount of sugar / Amount of sugar in one schnaps x 100 So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of schnaps = (9 shillings + 14 shillings) / (14 shillings per schnap x 100) = 56/14 = 4 schnaps Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more schnaps of bratwurst to the mixture.;
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of sugar and 7 cups of flour. Since Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, she needs to add an additional 5 cups (9 - 2 = 7). Now, we need to calculate how much more salt is required. The recipe calls for 4 cups of salt, but since Mary has already added 2 cups, she needs to add an additional 2 cups (4 - 2 = 2). Therefore, the total amount of each ingredient needed now is: Sugar: 7 + 2 = 9 Cups Flour: 7 + 5 = 12 Cups Salt: 2 + 2 = 4 Cups So, in order to make the torta according to the recipe, Mary should add 3 more cups of flour and 2 more cups of salt.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 Šalica brašna (which is equal to 480 grams) and the recipe requires 6 Šalica brašna. So, we need to add another 6 Šalica brašna (which is equal to 240 grams). Now, let's calculate how much Šećer she needs to add based on the given ratio of sugar to breadcrumbs:  For every 4 Šalica brašna, she needs to add 3 Šalica šećera (since 1 Šalica šećera = 150 grams). Therefore, if she adds 6 Šalica brašna, she needs to add 3 x 6 = 18 Šalica šeћera (or 720 grams). Since she has already added 12 Šalica brašна, she still needs to add 18 - 12 = 6 Šalica brašна (or 240 grams) more.;

Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 schegar of sugar to the dough and now she needs to add more. The recipe requires 12 schegars of sugar in total. So we need to find out how much more sugar do we need to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar that Mary has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 12 - 10 = 2.

Response:  If there are currently 19 bird families living near the mountain and 60 bird families have migrated for winter, then the total number of bird families that have left is 60 - 19 = 41. So, there are 41 more bird families that have migrated than those that stayed behind.;
Response:  We know that 87 bird families live near the mountain and that 7 of them have migrated to warmer climates for winter. So, we can assume that there are 87 - 7 = 80 bird families left behind in the area. Therefore, the number of bird families that remained in the area is 80.;
Response:  We know that 20 bird families migrated south for winter and 14 remained in the area near the mountain. So, initially there were 34 bird families (20 + 14) living near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that 85 bird families live near the mountain and 23 of them have migrated to Africa. So, the number of bird families left near the mountain is: 85 - 23 = 62. Now we are told that 37 bird families have migrated to Asia. So, the total number of bird families that remained near the mountain after some migration is: 62 + 37 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 bird families remaining near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that 42 bird families have gone to Africa and 31 bird families have gone to Asia. So, in total, 73 bird families (42 + 31) have left their original location. Now, we are told that most of the animals migrate to warmer climates during winter. Therefore, we can assume that some birds may also migrate to warmer climates. However, since we don't know how many birds stay in their original location or go somewhere else, let's assume that half of the remaining 73 bird families migrate to warmer climates. This means that 36 bird families (half of 73) will migrate to warmer climates. Now, we are asked how many more bird families have migrated to Africa than to Asia. To find this out, we need to compare the number of bird families that migrated to Africa with the number of bird families that migrated to Asia. Since we know that 42 bird families went to Africa and 31 bird families went to Asia, the difference between these two numbers is 11 (42 - 31). Therefore, there are 11 more bird families that migrated to Africa than to Asia.;
Response:  We know that 94 bird families have gone to Asia and 47 bird families have gone to Africa. So, in total, 94 + 47 = 141 bird families have left their original place to migrate. Now we are told that almost all animals (including birds) migrate to warmer climates during winter. This means that most of the remaining 38 bird families must also migrate to warmer places. Therefore, the number of bird families that remain in their original place is equal to the number of bird families that migrated to Africa minus the number of bird families that migrated to Asia. In other words, 38 - 141 = 0 bird families will stay in their original place. So, there are no bird families that will stay in their original place.;
Response:  We know that 18 bird families live near the mountain and 38 bird families have migrated to Africa. So, in total, we have 18 + 38 = 56 bird families that have left their original location. Now, we are told that 80 bird families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, the number of bird families that have not migrated (i.e., those that still remain at their original location) is equal to the total number of bird families minus the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa and Asia: 56 - 38 - 80 = 28 bird families. So, there are 28 bird families that have remained at their original location during winter.;
Response:  We know that 87 families of birds live near the mountain and if we add 18 new bird families to them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain will be:  $ Number of bird families = 87 + 18 = 105$  Therefore, there are 105 bird families living near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that 49 bird families live near the mountain and 24 new bird families have moved from the Arctic to join them. So, in total, there are 73 bird families living near the mountain (49 + 24). Therefore, the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is 73 - 59 = 14.;
Response:  We know that 27 bird families have migrated to warmer climates and left their original location near the mountain. So, there are now fewer birds remaining near the mountain than before they migrated.  To find out how many bird families remained nearby, we can divide the total number of bird families (which is given as 88) by the number of bird families that migrated (which is also given as 27). This gives us: Number of bird families remaining = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that migrated = 88 - 27 = 61 bird families. Therefore, there are 61 bird families remaining near the mountain after 27 bird families migrated to warmer climates.;
Response:  We know that 86 bird families have migrated to warmer climates and left their original location near the mountain. Of these, 45 were living close to the mountain. So, the number of bird families that did not migrate is equal to the total number of bird families minus the number of families that migrated. Therefore, we can write: Number of non-migrating bird families = Total number of bird families - Number of migrating bird families. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of non-migrating bird families = 131 (total number of bird families) - 45 (number of migrating bird families). Simplifying, we get: Number of non-migrating bird families = 86. Therefore, there are 86 more bird families that did not migrate than the number of families that migrated.;
Response:  We know that 35 bird families went to Asia and 62 bird families went to Africa. So, in total, 97 bird families left their original location (the mountain). Now, we are told that almost all animals migrate to warmer climates during winter. This means that only a small number of birds stayed behind at the mountain. Therefore, the number of bird families that remained at the mountain is equal to the number of bird families that went to Asia minus the number of bird families that went to Africa. Using the information given in the question, we can calculate this as follows: Number of bird families remaining at the mountain = 41 - (62 / 2) = 41 - 31 = 10. So, there are 10 bird families that remained at the mountain.;
Response:  We know that there are three bird families living near the mountain and they have been there all year round (Zima is almost here). So, their number remains constant at 3. Now, we need to calculate how many new bird families arrived from the Arctic during the winter season. According to the passage, 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the Arctic region during the winter. Therefore, the total number of bird families living near the mountain after the winter season is:  Total = 3 + 26 = 29 bird families.;
Response:  We know that Paul received 253 pencils for his birthday and he gave or lost 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, we can write an equation:  Number of pencils = 253 - 70 = 183 To find out how many pencils are left at the end of the school year, we need to multiply the number of pencils by the number of months in the school year:  Number of pencils x Months in the school year = 183 x 9 = 1641 Pencils Therefore, there are 1641 pencils left at the end of the school year.;
Response:  If Paul received 551 toys for his birthday and lost or gave away 374 of them until the end of the school year, then he must have had 177 toys left at the end of the year. So, he got 551 - 374 = 177 toys for his birthday.;
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 olovaka for his birthday and gave away 111 olovaka to his friends during the school year. This means he has 329 olovaka left (440 - 111 = 329). However, we are also told that he lost 106 olovaka. So, the total number of olovaka Paul has now is 329 - 106 = 223 olovaka.;
Response:  If Paul received 65 bottles of paint for his birthday and gave away 213 pencils to his friends during the school year, that means he has 44 (65 - 213) remaining pencils. However, the question states that he lost 16 pencils, so the final number of pencils he has is 44 - 16 = 28. Therefore, the answer is 28.;
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 589 crayons for his birthday and lost 161 of them during the school year. So he has 428 crayons left (589 - 161 = 428). Now, we need to find out how many more crayons he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of crayons he lost from the number of crayons he gave away: 571 - 161 = 410. Therefore, Paul gave away 410 more crayons than he lost.;
Response:  If Paul received 110 olovaka as a gift for his birthday and gave away 90 to his friends during the school year, then he has 210 olovaka left (110 + 90 = 210). Now, if he lost 412 olovaka, then he is left with -212 olovaka (-412 = 210). So, he has lost more olovaka than he gave away to his friends.;
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 pencils to his friends during the school year and lost 558 pencils, then he has 332 pencils left with him. So, he received 332 - 558 = 216 pencils as gifts for his birthday.;
Response:  If Paul gave away 52 envelopes and lost 535 envelopes during the school year, then he had initially 492 envelopes (since he started with 492 - 52 = 440). So, the number of envelopes that were either given away or lost is equal to 535 - 440 = 95. Therefore, 95 envelopes were either given away or lost.;
Response:  If Paul received 521 pieces of chalk and had 66 gumballs at the beginning of the school year, that means he started with a total of 587 objects (521 + 66). Then, if he didn't lose any gumballs during the year but gave some away as gifts, his remaining amount would be 587 - x, where x is the number of gumballs he gave away. Since he ended up with only 154 gumballs, we can set up the equation: 587 - x = 154. Solving for x, we get: x = 433. So, Paul gave away 433 gumballs during the school year.;
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 531 olovka and 38 guma for his birthday. If he didn't lose any gum, then at the end of the school year, he would have 531 - 38 = 493 olovka left. Now, we are told that he only lost 39 olovka, so the final amount of olovka he has is 493 - 39 = 454 olovka. Therefore, there were 39 more olovki than gum remaining after the school year ended.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 601 olovka and 406 guma. If Paul did not lose any gummi bears during the school year, then he had 601 - 336 = 265 olovki at the end of the school year. Since we are told that he has not lost any gummi bears, the number of remaining gummi bears is equal to the initial amount minus the number of olovki he had at the end of the school year: 406 - 265 = 141 gummi bears remained after the school year. Therefore, 141 more gummi bears remained than olovki.;
Response:  We know that Paul received 29 presents for his birthday and he lost or gave away 315 of them. So, we can calculate how many presents he actually had at the end of the school year as follows: Number of presents Paul had = Total number of presents - Number of presents given away or lost = 29 - 315 = -306 Therefore, Paul did not receive any oak leaves for his birthday.;
Response:  We know that Paul has lost 231 olovki and given away 308 to his friends. So, the difference between what he gave away and what he lost is:  308 - 231 = 77. Therefore, Paul has given away more olovka than he has lost.;
"Response:  We know that Paul received 457 gums and had 523 at the end of the school year without losing any. So, he gained 66 gums (457 - 523 = 66). Now, we need to find out how many oak leaves were left after the party. According to the problem, ""Koliko je više olovaka od gumenih krava ostalo?"" which means ""How many more oak leaves are there than gum leaves"". Since we already found out that Paul gained 66 gum leaves, we can now calculate the number of oak leaves he has left by subtracting the number of gum leaves from the initial amount of oak leaves:  Number of oak leaves = Initial number of oak leaves - Number of gum leaves gained  In this case, the initial number of oak leaves was 320, and Paul gained 66 gum leaves, so the number of oak leaves he has left is: Number of oak leaves = 320 - 66 = 254 oak leaves. Therefore, there are 254 oak leaves left after the party.";
Response:  At first, Konobor had 11 clients (mušteriji). Then, some of them left, leaving him with 3 clients still present. So, the number of clients that remained is equal to the initial number minus the number of those who left. Therefore, the answer is: $11 - 3 = 8$ clients remained.;
Response:  If Konobor had 3 mistresses and some of them left, he still has 4 mistresses. So, the number of clients that remained is 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, one more client stayed than those who left.;
Response:  At first, Konobor had 12 kupacs of coffee. After 9 cups were sold, he still had 12 - 9 = 3 cups left. So, at the beginning, Konobor had 12 kupcas of coffee.;
Response:  We know that Konobor had 14 musicians and there are still 5 more musicians left. So, in total, we have: 14 + 5 = 19 musicians. Therefore, there are 19 musicians remaining.;
Response:  At first, Konobor had 13 musicians. Then, some of them left and he gained 4 new musicians. So, his current number of musicians is: 13 - (some who left) + (new ones who joined) = 13 - x + 4 Where x is the number of musicians who left. Now we are asked how many musicians Konobor has left. Therefore, we need to find out what x is. According to the question, after some musicians left, Konobor had 9 musicians remaining. So, x = 9. Thus, the total number of musicians Konobor has now is: 13 - 9 + 4 = 6.;
Response:  We know that Konobor had initially 12 mice and then 15 cups of them went away. So, he has fewer mice now. Therefore, the number of mice he still has is equal to the initial amount minus the number of mice that left. In other words, we can write:  Number of mice = Initial number - Number of mice that left  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  Number of mice = 12 - 15  Number of mice = -3  So, Konobor still has 3 mice!;
Response:  The first man had 3 wives. Then he got some more and now has 8 wives in total. So, the number of new wives that came is 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, 5 new wives arrived.;
Response:  At first, Konobor had 8 massters and after some left, he was left with 5 kupacks. Then, he got 99 new clients. So, if we subtract the number of kupacks he already had from the total number of new clients, we get: Number of remaining clients = Total number of new clients - Number of kupacks he already had = 99 - 5 = 94 new clients. Therefore, there were 94 remaining clients.;
Response:  At first, Konobor had 12 clients (mušterija). Then some of them left, so he had fewer clients. After that, he got 10 new clients, which means he has now 22 clients in total (14 + 10 = 22). So, the number of clients Konobor has now is 22.;
Response:  At first, Dan had $3 dollars with him. Then he bought chocolate for $2 dollars, so now he has $1 dollar left. Therefore, at the beginning, Dan had $3 dollars.;
Response:  If Dan has $4 and bought a chocolate bar for $3 afterward, then...  So, the cost of one chocolate bar is $3.;
Response:  We have $4 and we buy 99 chocolates for $3 each, so we spend in total: $$4 \times 99 = 456$$ dollars. Therefore, there is left: $$4 - 456 = -452$$ dollars.;
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolates for $4 each. So, in total, he spent $4 + $4 = $8. Therefore, the cost of one chocolate is $8 / 2 = $4.;
"Response:  If he paid $2 for them and each one costs $3, then...

$2 / $3 = x
x = 6
So, Dan bought 6 chocolates.";
Response:  First, I bought chocolate for $2. So, my remaining money is $7 - $2 = $5. Then, I bought more chocolate for $3. Now, my remaining money is $5 - $3 = $2. Therefore, there are $2 in total left after buying both types of chocolate.;
Response:  If he paid $4 for one bar of chocolate and $7 for another bar of chocolate, then he spent a total of $11 ($4 + $7). So, the answer is $11.;
Response:  He spent $2 on chocolate that costs $6 and $3 on chocolate that costs $3. So he spent a total of: $$2 + $3 = $5$$ dollars on chocolate. Therefore, he spent $5 / $2 = $2.50 more on the cheaper chocolate than on the expensive one.;
Response:  He bought chocolate for $2 and chocolate for $3. So he spent a total of $5 (2 + 3).;
Response:  First, Dan had $4. Then he bought chocolate for $8, so now he has $4 - $8 = -$4. His friend gave him $5, so now his balance is $5 + (-$4) = $1. So, Dan has $1 left.;
"Response:  If Dan had $3 with him after buying a chocolate bar, and he started with $4, then...

$4 - $3 = $1

So, the chocolate bar cost $1.";
"Response:  If he paid $4 for 10 chocolates and each chocolate cost the same amount of money, then...

$$ \therefore \text {Amount left} = 4 - (10 \times 4) $$

$$ \therefore \text{Amount left} = 4 - 40 $$

$$ \therefore \text{Amount left} = -36 $$

So, there is $36 left over.";
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolates for $4 each. So, in total, he spent $4 + $4 = $8. Therefore, the cost of each chocolate is $8 / 2 = $4.;
Response:  He bought chocolate for $3 and chocolate for $7. So he spent a total of $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent more money on the chocolate that cost $7 than on the one that cost $3.;
Response:  If Dan has $4 and buys chocolate for $7 and candy for $2, then he spent $7 + $2 = $9 on chocolate. So, he spent more money on chocolate than on candy.;
Response:  If Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them at a garage sale, then he has 37 remaining books (115 - 78 = 37).;
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books in the garage sale, he had 105 remaining. So, if he started with some number of books (let's call it x), then we can set up the equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 268
So, Paul had 268 books at the beginning.";
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after selling some of them at a garage sale he had 62 books left. So, we can write an equation: 108 - x = 62 where x is the number of books sold at the garage sale. Now, we are asked to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we need to solve for x in the above equation.  Solving for x, we get: x = 46 Books (since 108 - 46 = 62). Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and after buying them at a garage sale, he had 151 books in total. So, we can calculate how many books he bought as follows: Number of books bought = Total number of books - Initial number of booksTotal number of books - Initial number of books= 151-50= 101books He therefore bought 101 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 2 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. Let's assume he sold half of his initial stock, which is 2/2 = 1 book. So, after selling one book, he has 2 - 1 = 1 book left. Now, he buys 150 new books, so he has 1 + 150 = 151 books in total. Finally, we are told that he has 58 books now, so let's subtract the number of books he originally had (1) from the total number of books he has (151): 58 - 1 = 57 books. Therefore, Paul sold 1 book at the garage sale.;
Response:  If Paul had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he had fewer books than before. Let's assume that he sold half of his original 21 books, so he has 21 / 2 = 10 books left. Now, he bought 42 new books, which means he has 10 + 42 = 52 books in total. So, he sold more books than he bought. The difference between the number of books he sold (21) and the number he bought (42) is 21 - 42 = -21 books. Therefore, he sold more books than he bought.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Now, he has 71 - x books left. He then bought 38 new books, so now he has 71 - x + 38 = 116 books in total. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract x from both sides: x + 38 = 116. Solving for x, we get x = 45. So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.;
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 108 books and 55 pencils. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he has 66 books and 59 pencils left. So, to find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had: 108 - 66 = 42. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Pavle had initially 106 olovaka and after selling some of them at garage sale he had 82 olovaka left. So, we can calculate how many olovaka he sold by subtracting the number of olovaka he had left from the initial amount:  Number of olovaka sold = Initial number of olovaka - Final number of olovaka  Number of olovaka sold = 106 - 82  = 24  Therefore, Pavle sold 24 olovaka at the garage sale.;
"Response:  If Paul had 136 books at first and sold some of them in the garage sale, then he must have had fewer than 136 books left after the sale.  We know that he sold 27 books during the garage sale, so let's assume that he had x books left after selling those 27 books.  Since we are asked how many books Paul sold, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x - 27 = 109 (books left after sale)

Now we need to solve for x, which is the number of books Paul had before the garage sale. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 27:

x / 27 = 109 / 27

x = 4 (books Paul had before the garage sale)

Therefore, Paul sold 27 books during the garage sale.";
"Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then we are told that he sold some of them at a garage sale, which reduced the number of books he had. The statement ""ostalo mu je 68 knjiga"" means that after selling some books at the garage sale, he was left with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is equal to 68 - 95 = -27 books. Since negative numbers cannot be sold, the correct answer is 0 books.";
Response:  We know that Pavle had initially 95 olovaka and 153 books. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 olovka. So, to find out how many books Pavle sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had:  Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books after the sale  In this case, the initial number of books was 153, and after the sale, Pavle had 13 books remaining, so the number of books sold at the garage sale is:  Number of books sold = 153 - 13 = 140 books.;
Response:  We know that Pavle had initially 42 olovka and 143 books. After selling some of his books at garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 olovaka left. So, we can calculate how many olovaka he sold by subtracting the number of olovaka he had after the garage sale from the initial number:  Number of olovaka sold = Initial number of olovaka - Number of olovaka after garage sale = 42 - 19 = 23 olovaka Therefore, Pavle sold 23 olovaka at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 10 roses and Jessica took out 8 more from her bouquet and put them in the vase. So, the total number of roses in the vase is:  Initially, there were 10 roses + 8 additional roses = 18 roses in the vase.;
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the vase (Jessica had cut them from her garden). Then, she added another 16 roses to the vase, so now there are 32 roses in total. Finally, the statement says that there are 23 roses left in the vase after Jessica took some more out. Therefore, the number of roses in the vase at the beginning was 32 - 23 = 9.;
Response:  Jessica has already thrown away 4 roses from the vase and then picked some new ones from her garden to add to the vase. So, initially there were 4 + 7 = 11 roses in the vase. Then, she added 2 more roses, so now there are 11 + 2 = 13 roses in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses that Jessica picked is 13 - 4 = 9.;
Response:  Jessica has thrown away 33 roses and added new ones to the vase, so there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses she has taken out than she threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase. So, the answer is:  Number of more roses = Total number of roses in the vase - Number of roses thrown away  = 17 - 33  = -16  Therefore, Jessica took out 16 more roses than she threw away.;
Response:  Jessica has 34 roses that she took from her garden and added to the vase. Then, she picked some more new roses from her garden and put them in the vase too. So, the total number of roses in the vase is 34 + (some number) = x. Since Jessica took 15 roses out of the vase, we know that x - 15 = 21. Therefore, the answer is 7.;
Response:  We know that there were initially seven roses and then Jessica picked another rose from her garden which had a total of 59 roses. So, in total, she picked 66 roses (7 + 59). Now, we are told that in the vase, there are 20 roses left. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica picked is equal to the number of roses left in the vase minus the initial number of roses in the vase. In other words, the answer is 20 - 7 = 13. So, Jessica picked 13 roses.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses in the garden and Jessica picked another rose from her own flowerbed which had 12 roses in total. So, the total number of roses she had was 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Now, we are told that there are 21 roses in the garden. Therefore, the number of roses left in the garden is 21 - 25 = -4 roses. Since there can't be negative numbers of roses, it means that there are no roses left in the garden.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 16 roses (15 + 1). Next, she picked more orchids from her garden, bringing the total number of orchids to 96 (62 + 34). Therefore, the number of roses Jessica picked is 1.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 13 roses (12 + 1) in the vase. Next, she picked an additional orchid from her garden, bringing the total number of orchids to 3 (2 + 1). Therefore, the final count is 13 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. So, Jessica picked 2 orchids.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 6 roses (including the one she picked) and still 3 orchids in the vase. Finally, she added more roses to the vase, making it 12 roses total. Therefore, the number of orchids in the vase is still 3. So, the final count is: Roses - 12 Orchids - 3;
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 8 roses (7 + 1). Now, she also picked an additional orchid from her garden, making it 9 orchids (12 + 1). Therefore, the number of orchids is greater than the number of roses in the vase, which means that there are more orchids than roses in the vase. So, the correct answer is: More than 11 roses.;
Response:  If she had initially 3 roses and then added 16 more (as stated in the problem), that means she has a total of 19 roses now. So, to find out how many roses she originally had, we can divide the number of roses she has now by the number she added later: $ \frac{19}{16} = 3 $$ Therefore, Jessica originally had 3 roses in her garden before adding any more.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 14 roses (including the one she already had). Next, she picked more orchids from her garden, bringing the total number of orchids to 91. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica picked is equal to the original number minus the new total number of orchids, which is: 14 - 91 = -77. So, Jessica picked -77 roses.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 orhideje and 16 ruža in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 16 + 1 = 17 ruže in the vase. Next, she picked an orchid from her garden as well, so now there are 3 + 1 = 4 orchids in the vase. Therefore, the final number of orhideje is 4, and the final number of ruže is 17.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 7 roses (including the one she already had). Now, she picks an additional orchid from her garden, bringing the total number of orchids to 21. Therefore, the final count is: 7 roses + 21 orchids = 28 flowers in the vase. So, there are more orchids than roses in the vase.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 10 roses (including the one she already had) and still 6 orchids. Finally, she added more orchids to the vase, making it have 13 orchids in total. Therefore, the number of orchids in the vase is greater than the number of roses, which means that there are 13 orchids and 7 roses in the vase.;
Response:  We know that Robinova kosa was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some hair. So let's call the original length of her hair L = 17 inches. Then we know that after cutting off some hair, her new length is L = x inches, where x is less than 17. Now, we are asked to find out how much hair she cut off. To do this, we can use the fact that the difference between two lengths is equal to the smaller length minus the larger length. In other words, if L1 - L2 = x, then L1 = L2 + x. Substituting L1 = 17 and L2 = x, we get: 17 - x = x + x. Simplifying, we get: 2x = 17. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 8.5 inches. Therefore, Robinova cut off 8.5 inches of her hair.;
Response:  If Robin had 20 inches of hair before she cut it and now has 10 inches, then we can calculate how much she cut off as follows: 20 - 10 = 10 inches. So, Robin cut off 10 inches of her hair.;
Response:  At first, Robinova kosa was 16 inches long and she cut off 11 inches. So now her hair is 5 inches (16 - 11 = 5) longer than it was before. Then, she grew another 12 inches, so now her total length of hair is 17 inches (5 + 12 = 17). Therefore, Robinova kosa is currently 17 inches long.;
Response:  If Robinova kosa was originally 19 inches long and has grown an additional 18 inches, then her current length is:  Length = Original length + Growth = 19 + 18 = 37 inches.;
Response:  If Robin had 13 inches of hair and she cut off 1 inch, then she has 12 inches of hair now. So, if she started with 14 inches of hair, then she has 13 inches of hair left after cutting off 1 inch. Therefore, her current length of hair is 13 inches.;
Response:  The original length of Robinova's hair was 14 inches and it grew by 8 inches. Then she cut off 20 inches. So now her hair is 14 + 8 - 20 = 6 inches long.;
Response:  If Danny has 12 boxes in his collection and he found 53 balls inside one of them, then we can assume that each box contains an average number of balls equal to 53/12 = 4.375 balls per box. So, if Danny has 12 boxes, he should have a total of 12 x 4.375 = 50.5 balls in his collection.;
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 21 marbles from his collection and found some more in the park. So, if he has 53 marbles in total, then he must have found at least 32 marbles (53 - 21 = 32) in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 51 old coins and found 63 new ones in the park. So he gained 63 - 51 = 12 new coins. Now, we are told that he has 33 coins left in his collection. Therefore, the number of coins Danny had at the beginning was 33 + 12 = 45 coins.;
"Response:  We know that Danny threw away 35 old coins and found 36 new ones in the park. So, he has 22 coins left in his collection after throwing away the old ones. Now, let's calculate how many more coins Danny found than he threw away:

New coins found = Total number of coins found - Number of coins thrown away
= 36 - 35
= 1

So, Danny found one more coin than he threw away.";
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 Poké Balls in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he gained 30 - 63 = -33 Poké Balls. Now we are told that he has 42 Poké Balls in his collection. To find out how many more Poké Balls Danny threw than those he found, we subtract the number of Poké Balls he found from the total number of Poké Balls he has: 42 - 30 = 12. Therefore, Danny threw 12 more Poké Balls than he found in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 caps and 8 labels in the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 objects at first. Then, he collected 28 bottle caps and 63 label stickers, so his total collection now is 30 + 28 + 63 = 121 objects. Therefore, Danny had 121 - 30 = 91 objects (poklopaca) at the beginning.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 30 omotaća in the park and he found 22 poklopaca and 30 omotaća in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 30 + 22 = 52 omotaća.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 caps and 14 labels in the park. Now he has 7 caps and 86 labels in his collection. To find out how many more caps he found than labels, we can subtract the number of labels from the number of caps:  Number of more caps = Number of caps - Number of labels = 30 - 14 = 16 So, Danny found 16 more caps than labels in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 caps and 28 labels in the park. Now he has 68 bottle caps and 51 stickers in his collection. To find out how many more stickers than caps Danny found in the park, we can subtract the number of stickers he already had from the total number of items he found:  Number of stickers found in the park = 28 - 51 = -23 stickers  So, Danny found fewer stickers than caps in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 71 caps and 24 labels in the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 labels in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 71 + 24 = 95 items of packaging. Since he now has 28 more bottle caps and 16 more labels, we can conclude that Danny has 95 + 28 = 123 pieces of packaging overall. Therefore, Danny has 123 - 71 = 52 additional pieces of packaging (ambalaje) from what he found in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 27 poklopaca for bottles and 43 omotača in his collection. So, he had 62 packets of caps and labels before. If each packet contains 5 caps and 1 label, then he collected 62 x 5 = 310 caps and 62 x 1 = 62 labels. Now, we need to find out how many more labels than caps Danny collected. Therefore, we subtract the number of caps from the number of labels: 62 - 310 = -248. So, Danny has -248 labels more than caps. In other words, he has 43 - (-248) = 291 omotača more than caps.;
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 poklopaca in the park and now he has 25 poklopaca in his collection. So, if we subtract the number of poklopaca he had after losing them from the total number of poklopaca he initially had, we can find out how many poklopaca Danny had at the beginning. Therefore, the answer is:  Danny had 41 poklopaca at the beginning (66 - 25 = 41).;
Response:  If Danny had 25 poklopaca in his collection before he found some more in the park, and now he has 32 poklopaca in his collection, then we can calculate how many additional poklopaca he found in the park as follows:  Additional poklopaca = New number of poklopaca - Original number of poklopaca = 32 - 25 = 7 Therefore, Danny found 7 more poklopaca in the park than he originally had in his collection.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 60 old boxes at first and found 58 new ones in the park. So, he now has 67 boxes in total. To find out how many boxes Danny had at the beginning, we can subtract the number of new boxes he found from the total number of boxes he has now: 67 - 58 = 9. Therefore, Danny had 9 boxes at the beginning.;
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 6 old caps and found 50 new ones in the park. So, he has 6 + 50 = 56 caps now. But we are asked how many more caps he found than the ones he threw away. Therefore, the difference between the number of caps he found (50) and the number he threw away (6) is equal to the total number of caps he collected: 56 - 6 = 50. So, Danny found 50 more caps than the ones he threw away.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 54 old Pokemon cards and found 48 new ones in the park. So he now has 52 Pokemon cards in his collection. To find out how many more Pokemon cards Danny threw than the ones he found, we need to subtract the number of new Pokemon cards from the total number of Pokemon cards he had before. Therefore, the answer is:  More = 54 - 48 = 6.  So, Danny threw 6 additional Pokemon cards beyond the ones he found in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 82 packets of cigarettes and 29 boxes of matches in the park. So he had 82 + 29 = 111 items at first. Now he has 42 caps and 61 rolls in his collection. Therefore, Danny initially had 111 - 42 - 61 = 70 items.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 caps and 39 bottlecaps in the park. Now he has 16 bottlecaps and 68 capsk. So, initially, Danny had 66 + 39 = 105 objects.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 caps and 50 bottlecaps in the park. So he now has 21 bottle caps and 52 cans in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than cans, we need to subtract the number of cans from the total number of items he found in the park:  Number of bottle caps = Total number of items found - Number of cans  In this case, the total number of items found was 96 (46 + 50). Subtracting the number of cans (50) gives us the number of bottle caps found:  Number of bottle caps = 96 - 50 = 46 Therefore, Danny found 46 more bottle caps than cans in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 caps and 5 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 cap collections. So, the number of more caps than lids Danny found is:  65 - 31 = 34  Therefore, Danny found 34 more caps than lids in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 58 caps and 25 labels in the park. Now he has 11 labels and 12 caps in his collection. So, we can calculate how many more labels and caps Danny collected as follows: Number of additional labels = 11 - 25 = -14 Number of additional caps = 12 - 58 = -46 Therefore, Danny now has 14 fewer labels than he had in the park, and 46 fewer caps.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 15 caps and 18 labels in the park. Now he has 67 labels and 35 caps in his collection. So, we can calculate how many more labels than caps Danny has as follows: Number of additional labels = Total number of labels - Total number of caps = 67 - 35 = 32 Therefore, Danny has 32 more labels than caps.;
Response:  If Jake has 11 fewer apples than Steve, and Jake has 17 apples in total, then Steve must have had 17 + 11 = 28 apples initially.;
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 14 brussels sprouts and less than 28 (since he has 15). So, we can say that Steven has between 14 and 28 brussels sprouts. Now, let's check how many brussels sprouts Jake has. According to the question, Jake has fewer than 7 brussels sprouts. Therefore, Jake must have exactly 7 brussels sprouts.  So, the answer is 7.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 beans less than Steven, who has 13 more beans than Jill. So, if we subtract 18 from Jill's number of beans, we get:  Jill has 27 beans (13 + (-18) = 27).;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer brains than Steven and Steven has more brains than Jill. So if we compare Jake to Jill directly, Jake has 3 less brain than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 3 - 3 = 0 brains more than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Steven has more than Jake (12 - 11 = 1). So, Jill must have at least as many breskva as Jake. Therefore, Jill has 1 + 1 = 2 more breskva than Jake.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 breasts and more than 9 breasts. So, he must have exactly 8 breasts.  Therefore, Jake has 8 breasts.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer apples than Steve and 8 more than Jill. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 7 = 3x / 2 apples. And if Jill has y apples, then Steve has 17 - y apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: 3x/2 + y = 17. Solving for y (the number of apples Jill has), we get y = 9. Therefore, Jill has 9 apples.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer balls than Steven and 18 more than Jill. So, if we subtract 9 from Steven's number of balls (which is 16), we get: 16 - 9 = 7. Therefore, Steven has 7 more balls than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more brekves than Jake and Jill has 5 less brekvi than Jake. So we can write an equation as follows:  Jake - 5 = Steven + 18  Now let's solve for Jake's number of brekves:  Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:  Jake = Steven + 13  Therefore, Jake has 13 brekves.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 5 brains than Steven. So if Steven has x brains, then Jake has less than x - 5 brains.  Now we are told that Steven has 18 more brains than Jill. This means that Jill has x - 18 brains. Therefore, Jake has (x - 18) - (x - 5) = 3 brains fewer than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 15 more brskva than Jake and Jill has 12 less brskva than Jake. So if Jake has x brskva, then Jill has x - 12 = 3x brskva. Therefore, Jake has 16 - 15 = 1 brskva less than Steven.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steve (Jake has 79 apples and Steve has 19). So, we can say that Jake has x apples where x is equal to 79 minus Steve's number of apples. Therefore, Jake has 79 - 19 = 60 apples.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer apples than Steve and 3 more pears than Steve. So, if Steve has 9 apples and 8 pears, then Jake must have 4 (apples) - 13 = 5 apples and 3 + 8 = 11 pears. Therefore, Jake has 5 apples and 11 pears in total.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 more apples than Steve and 8 more pears than Steve. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:
Apples: Jake - Steve = 6
Pears: Jake - Steve = 8
Now, let's find out how many apples and pears each of them has:
Jake has 17 apples and 8 pears, so he has:
Apples: 17
Pears: 8
Steve has 16 apples and 16 pears, so he has:
Apples: 16
Pears: 16
Now, to find out how many more apples Steve has than Jake, we subtract their number of apples:
More Apples: Steve - Jake = 4 (Since Jake has 17 apples and Steve has 16 apples)
So, Steven has 4 more apples than Jake.";
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 more apples than Steve and 10 more oranges than Steve. So, if we write it down as an equation:
Jake - Steve = 3 (apples)
Jake - Steve = 10 (oranges)
Now let's solve for the number of apples:
Steven has 12 apples + 3 = 15 apples
So, Steven has 15 apples more than Jake. Now, let's find out how many jabukas Steven has:
Steven has 15 apples more than Jake, so he has:
Steven - Jake = 15 (jabukas)
Steven has 15 jabukas more than Jake.";
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 breaks and Jake has fewer than Steven who has 67 more breaks than Jill. So we can write an equation as follows:  Steven = 12  Jake = x  Since Jake has fewer breaks than Steven, we know that Jake’s number of breaks is less than or equal to 12. Therefore, we can conclude that Jake has at most 12 breaks. Thus, Jake has exactly 4 breaks (since he has 4 less than Steven).  So, Jake has 4 breaks.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer biscuits than Steven, and Steven has eight more biscuits than Jill. So, if Jake has x biscuits, then Steven has 8x biscuits, and Jill has x - 8 biscuits. Since Jake has 12 less biscuits than Steven, we can write an equation:  x = 8x - 12. Solving for x, we get:  x = 96. Therefore, Jill has 96 biscuits.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 brakes and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x brakes where x is between 12 (the number of brakes Jake has) and 19 (the number of brakes Steven has). Therefore, Jake has 15 brakes.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more apples than Jill. So, if we let S represent the number of apples Steven has, J represent the number of apples Jake has, and J' represent the number of apples Jill has, we can write the following equations based on the information given in the question:
S - 6 = J (Since Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steven)
J + 3 = J' (Since Jake has 3 more apples than Jill)
Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how many apples Jill has. To do this, we can first add equation (2) to itself twice:
J' = J + 3 + J + 3 = J + 6
So, Jill has 6 apples. Therefore, the answer is 6.";
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 10 beeches and more than 84 plums. So, we can say that Jake has x beeches where x is between 84 and 10 =74. Now, we also know that Steven has 13 beeches and 52 plums. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of beeches (Jake) = 74 + Number of plums (Steven). Substituting the value of number of plums from the problem, we get:  Number of beeches (Jake) = 74 + 13 = 87. Therefore, Jake has 87 beeches.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 jabuka and 17 breskvi less than Steven. So, if we subtract 17 from Jake's total number of fruits, we get:  Jake has 13 - 17 = -4 jabuka. Therefore, Jake has -4 jabuka.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer apples than Steve and 10 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 8 = 2x apples. Also, we know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steve, so Jake has 2x + 10 = 3x apples. Now, let's find out how many more oranges Jake has than Steve. According to the problem, Jake has 18 more oranges than Steve. Therefore, the number of oranges Jake has is 3x - 18 = 2x + 18 apples. Finally, we can convert this answer from apples to oranges by dividing it by 10 (since there are 10 oranges in each apple). So, the final answer is:  Number of oranges Jake has = 2x + 18 / 10 = 4x + 18 oranges.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven and 4 more pears than Steven. So, if we let A be the number of apples Jake has and P be the number of pears he has, we can write the equation:
A = S - 3
P = S + 4
where S is the number of apples Steven has. Substituting the value given in the question for S (19), we get:
A = 19 - 3 = 16
P = 19 + 4 = 23
So, Steven has 23 more pears than Jake.";
Response:  If she had $78 and spent $15 in the supermarket, then she has $63 left ($78 - $15 = $63).;
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $33 left afterward, that means she started with $33 + $78 = $111. So, Olivia had $111 to begin with.;
Response:  The initial amount of money was $100. She got $148 from ATMs, so now she has $248 ($100 + $148). Then, after visiting the supermarket, she spent $159, leaving her with $79 ($248 - $159). Therefore, she spent $79.;
Response:  If she had $3 in her wallet to start with and then collected $49 from ATMs, that means she has $52 now (including the original $3). Then, if she spent $49 at the supermarket, there would be nothing left except for the initial $3, so the amount of money she spent is equal to the amount she collected from ATMs minus the amount she had initially ($52 - $3 = $49). Therefore, she collected more money from ATMs than she spent at the supermarket.;
Response:  First, we know that $53 was in Olivia's wallet to start with. Then she collected $91 more from the ATM. So now she has $144 ($53 + $91). After visiting the supermarket, she had $14 left. Therefore, the amount of money she spent at the supermarket is $144 - $14 = $130.;
Response:  If she had $106 initially and spent $49 in the exhibit hall, then her remaining balance after visiting the exhibit hall would be: $106 - $49 = $57. So, she spent $57 at the exhibit hall. Now, let's calculate how much she spent at the supermarket: $57 - $26 = $31. Therefore, she spent $31 at the supermarket.;
"Response:  If there were originally $54 in the wallet and after visiting the supermarket, $29 remained, then we can calculate how much Olivia spent as follows:

$54 - $29 = $25
So, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket.";
"Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet initially, then we can calculate how much money is left for her as follows:

$128 - $38 = $90

So, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after buying groceries.";
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and 5 were obliterated, that means he has 14 remaining apps on his phone. So, the number of applications on Dave's phone is 14.;
Response:  At first, Dave had some applications on his phone. After he deleted 18 of them, he was left with 5 remaining apps. So, to find out how many applications Dave had at the beginning, we can divide the total number of applications he had after deleting some (5) by the number he had before deleting any (18). Therefore, Dave had 18 applications on his phone at the start.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 10 applications on his phone. Then he added 11 new ones, so now he has 21 applications in total (10 + 11 = 21). After deleting some of them, he is left with 4 applications. Therefore, the final number of applications on Dave's phone is 4.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 21 applications on his phone. Then he added 89 new applications, so now he has 89 + 21 = 106 applications on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 applications. So, the difference between the number of applications he added and the number he deleted is 106 - 24 = 82 applications. Therefore, Dave added 82 applications to his phone more than he deleted.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications on his phone. Then he added 71 new applications, so now he has 86 (15 + 71) applications in total. After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 remaining applications. So, the difference between the number of applications he had after adding and the number he had before deleting is:  86 - 14 = 72. Therefore, Dave added more applications than he deleted by 72.;
Response:  If Dave had 16 applications and 77 files before deleting some of them, that means he had 16 + 77 = 93 items in total. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, he deleted 84 (93 - 5) applications and files.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 3 apps and 7 files. So, to find out how many files were deleted, we can subtract the number of files after from the number of files before:  Number of files deleted = 7 - 21 = -14 files.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, in total, Dave has more applications than files on his phone. Therefore, the number of applications is greater than the number of files. The difference between these two numbers is 6 (21 - 4 = 6). So, there are 6 more applications than files on Dave's phone.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. So, the number of files is greater than the number of applications. Therefore, there are more files (15) than applications (6).;
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications on his phone and then added some more to have 18 left-handed apps, that means he must have added at least one application. So, the answer is 1.;
Response:  If Dave had 59 files and applications before deleting some of them, that means he had 59 - 15 = 44 files and applications left after deleting some of them. Then, if he deleted more apps and files, it would be 44 - 12 = 32 remaining apps and files. So, Dave deleted 12 apps and files.;
Response:  If Dave had 24 files and applications before deleting some of them, that means he had 24 - 13 = 11 remaining files and applications after deleting some of them. So, he lost 2 files (11 - 9 = 2). Therefore, he deleted 2 files.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, in total, Dave has more applications than files on his phone. Therefore, the number of applications is greater than the number of files. The difference between these two numbers is equal to 12 - 5 = 7. So, Dave has 7 more applications than files on his phone.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting those apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, to find out how many more files than applications are left on his phone, we can subtract the number of applications from the total number of files:  Number of files = Total number of files - Number of applications  In this case, the total number of files is 24, and the number of applications is 2, so:  Number of files = 24 - 2 = 22  Therefore, there are 22 more files than applications left on Dave's phone after he deleted some of them.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 242 baseball cards and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate how many cards Nell has left as follows:  Number of cards Nell has = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 242 - 136 = 106 Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.;
Response:  If Nell had 301 cards and gave 301 to Jeff, then she has none left. So, the number of cards Nell has is equal to 154. Therefore, the answer is 154.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, we can calculate how many cards Nell gave to Jeff as follows: Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = Total number of cards Nell had - Number of cards Nell now has = 528 - 252 = 276 cards. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards.;
Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has fewer cards now than before. So, her new number of cards is less than 566.  Since Jeff started with 234 cards and got some from Nell, his new number of cards is greater than 234. Therefore, Jeff's current number of cards is 234 + x, where x is the difference between Nell's original number of cards (566) and her new number of cards (x).  Substituting the given information into this equation, we get: 234 + x = 535  Solving for x, we find that x = 301.  Therefore, Jeff's current number of cards is 234 + 301 = 535.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she has fewer than 309 - x baseball cards now. Then we are told that she got 149 more 10 card packs from Jeff. This means she received in total (309 - x) + 149 = 458 new cards. Since each pack contains 10 cards, she now has 458 / 10 = 45 sets of 10 cards each or 450 individual cards. Finally, we are told that she still has 149 10-card packs left over, so she must have started with at least 450 + 149 = 600 baseball cards in total. Therefore, Nell has at least 600 baseball cards, including both her original collection and the ones she received from Jeff.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she now has 404 baseball cards plus whatever number of 10-card packs she received from Jeff.  Since each 10-card pack contains 10 cards, we can calculate the total number of 10-card packs Nell received as follows: Number of 10-card packs = Total number of cards - Number of baseball cards = 404 - 246 = 158 Therefore, Nell received 158 10-card packs from Jeff. Now, let's find out how many 10 cards Nell has in total. The number of 10 cards Nell has is equal to the number of 10-card packs she received times the number of cards in each pack. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of 10 cards = Number of 10-card packs x Number of cards per pack = 158 x 10 = 1580 Finally, we subtract the number of baseball cards Nell still has (which is 404) from the total number of cards she has (which is 1580): Number of 10 cards Nell has = 1580 - 404 = 1176 Therefore, Nell has 1176 10 cards in addition to her 404 baseball cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards and gave 195 to John. So she has 378 left (573 - 195 = 378). Now we are told that she gave some to Jeff as well. Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the number of cards she has left minus the number of cards she gave to John. In this case, it would be 378 - 195 = 183. So Nell gave Jeff 183 baseball cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs she has from the total number of baseball cards she has:  Number of baseball cards = 178 - 55 = 123 So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 10-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 376 10-card packs and 111 baseball cards. To find out how many more 10-card packs Nell has than baseball cards, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of 10-card packs: 376 - 111 = 265. So, Nell has 265 more 10-card packs than baseball cards.;
Response:  If Paco had 19 kolača at first and then he ate some of them, that means he has less kolača now. So, we can write an equation:  Paco had x kolača at first, where x is the number of kolača he had initially. Now, he has 35 - 19 = 16 kolača left. Therefore, the value of x is 19.;
Response:  If Paco had 28 kolačića and he ate some of them, then he has less than 28 kolačica left. We don't know how many he ate, but let's assume he ate half of them (14). So, now Paco has 28 - 14 = 14 kolačica left. And if he ate 7 of those remaining kolačica, then he has 14 - 7 = 7 kolačica left. Therefore, Paco ate 7 kolačica.;
Response:  At first, Paco had 40 kolačića. Then he ate two kolačića, so he had 40 - 2 = 38 kolačića left. After that, he bought 37 more kolačića, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 kolačića in total. Therefore, Paco had 75 kolačića at the end.;
Response:  Paco had 25 kolačića and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 20 kolačića left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought 3 more kolačića. So, now he has 23 kolačića in total (20 + 3 = 23). Therefore, Paco ate more kolačića than he bought.;
Response:  Paco had 13 kolačića and he ate 2. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he bought 36 more kolačića. So, his total amount of kolačića is 11 + 36 = 47. Therefore, he bought more than he ate.;
Response:  If Paco had 40 kolačica and he ate 5 of them, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 left.  He gave 13 to his friends, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 kolačica left. Therefore, Paco had 22 kolačica at the end.;
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 cookies and given 13 to his friend. So he has 17 - 13 = 4 more cookies than what he gave away. Therefore, he has 4 more cookies than those that he gave away.;
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and ate 16 of them, leaving him with 12 - 16 = 4 remaining cookies. He then gave 21 of his remaining cookies to his friend. So, the number of cookies he gave away is 21. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies he ate (16) and the number of cookies he gave away (21) is 16 - 21 = -5.;
Response:  Paco had initially 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salty cookies. To find out how many cookies are left for Paco, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the initial total number of cookies he had. So, the number of cookies left for Paco is:  Initially, Paco had 22 + 75 = 97 cookies. After eating some, he has 97 - (15 x 2) = 97 - 30 = 67 cookies left. Therefore, there are 67 cookies left for Paco.;
Response:  We know that Paco had 9 sweet rolls and 6 salty rolls to start with. He then ate 36 sweet rolls and 3 salty rolls. So, if he ate 36 sweet rolls, he must have started with at least 36 - 9 = 27 sweet rolls left. Similarly, since he ate 3 salty rolls, he must have started with at least 6 - 3 = 3 salty rolls left. Therefore, Paco had 27 + 3 = 30 salty rolls in total.;
Response:  Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies. So, he has left 32 sweet cookies (37 - 5) and 9 salty cookies (11 - 2). Now, we need to find out how many more sweet cookies Paco ate than salty cookies. To do this, we can subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the total number of sweet cookies he had:  Number of sweet cookies eaten = 32 - 2 = 30. Therefore, Paco ate 30 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.;
"Response: 
Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 salty cookies. So, he ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate is:

34 - 20 = 14

Therefore, Paco ate 14 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.";
Response:  If Paco had 37 kolačića to start with and he ate 36 kolača, then he has one less kolačić than he started with. So, Paco has 36 kolačića left.;
Response:  Paco had 36 kolača initially. He gave his friend 14 kolačića (kolača divided by 4), so he had 36 - 14 = 22 kolačića left. Then, he ate 10 kolačića, leaving him with 22 - 10 = 12 kolačića remaining. Therefore, Paco had 12 kolačica at the end.;
Response:  Paco had 41 kolačić and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 32 left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 more kolačić. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolačić he had after giving some to his friend and the number he ate is equal to the number he gave away: 32 - 9 = 23. So, Paco ate 23 more kolačić than he gave away.;
Response:  Paco has eaten 6 cookies and given 30 to his friend. So he has 30 - 6 = 24 left. Then, he has eaten 23 more cookies, so he has 24 + 23 = 47 remaining cookies. Therefore, he gave his friend 30 - 23 = 7 more cookies than he ate himself.;
Response:  At first, Paco had 97 + 34 = 131 kolačića in total. Then he ate 15 slatki kolači and 56 slanih kolači. So, after eating, he has 131 - 15 = 116 kolačića left (slatki). Now we need to subtract the number of slati kolači that he ate from the total number of slani kolači that he had at the beginning: 116 - 56 = 60 kolačića (slani) left. Therefore, there are 60 kolačića left for Paco.;
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 slanih kolačića initially. After eating some of them, he had 14 slatki kolači and 9 slanih kolačica remaining. So, we can calculate how many slanih kolačića Paco had at first as follows: Total number of slanih kolačića = Initial amount - Amount eaten = 26 - (14 + 9) = 8 Therefore, Paco had 8 slanih kolačića initially.;
Response:  If Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies, that means he had a total of 45 cookies (39 + 6 = 45). Then, if he ate 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet cookies, it means he left with 12 salty cookies (45 - 23 = 22) and 32 sweet cookies (45 - 32 = 13). So, the number of more sweet cookies Paco ate than salty ones is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, Paco ate 7 more sweet cookies than salty ones.;
Response:  Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. So, he ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the total number of salty cookies he had is equal to the difference between the number of sweet cookies he ate and the total number of sweet cookies he had. Therefore, the number of salty cookies Paco ate is 28 - 25 = 3 more than the number of sweet cookies he ate, which is 15 + 3 = 18. So, Paco ate 18 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.;
Response:  If she received $7 and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent half of the amount she received, which is $3.50. Therefore, she spent $3.50.;
Response:  If Gwen received $10 for her birthday and she spent $8 of it, then she has $6 left. So, Gwen received $10 = 6 + 4 (the amount she spent).;
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 from her dad for a total of $6. Then she spent $3, so she had $6 - $3 = $3 left.;
Response:  If Za received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, then she has a total of $13 ($8 + $5).  If she spent $4, that means she has $9 left ($13 - $4). So, Za got more money from her mom than from her dad.;
Response:  The mother gave her $3, and the father gave her $6, so in total she received $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). So, she got more money from her father than from her mother.;
Response:  The girl received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, so she has a total of $12. If she spent $4, then she has $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). So, she received more money from her mother than from her father.;
Response:  If Za received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, then she has a total of $7 ($5 + $2).  If she spent $6, that means she has $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). So, Za received more money from her father than from her mother.;
Response:  If Josh had 9 marbles in his collection and lost some of them, then he has fewer than 9 marbles now. We don't know how many marbles he lost, but we can call that number x. So, if Josh has 4 marbles left, then x = 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, Josh lost 5 marbles.;
Response:  If Josh had n kuglica in his collection and lost 21 kuglica, then he has n - 21 kuglica left. Since he now has 12 kuglica, we can set up an equation: n = 12 + 21. Solving for n, we get: n = 33. Therefore, Josh had 33 kuglica in his collection before losing any.;
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 marbles in his collection. Then he lost 11 marbles and found 5 new ones. So, if we subtract the number of marbles he lost (11) from the total number of marbles he had at first (19), we get: 19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, Josh has 8 marbles left in his collection now.;
Response:  If Josh had 4 marbles in his collection and lost 16 marbles, then he has lost 16 - 4 = 12 marbles. But if he found 8 new marbles, that means he gained 8 - 12 = -4 marbles. So, he actually lost more marbles than he found. Therefore, the answer is -4 marbles.;
Response:  If Josh had 7 marbles in his collection and lost 8 of them, then he had 7 - 8 = -1 marble left.  Then, he found 10 new marbles, so he gained 10 + 1 = 11 marbles in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles he found (11) and the number he lost (-1) is equal to 10 marbles.;
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles in his collection and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left in his collection. So, he has 14 marbles now.;
Response:  If Josh had 20 marbles in his collection and gave 2 to Jack, then he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left. So, Josh has 18 marbles now.;
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 kuglica in his collection. Then, Jack gave him 20 more kuglica, so now he has 42 kuglica (22 + 20).;
Response:  If Josh had 19 balls in his collection earlier and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8). So, he has 8 balls now.;
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 bullets in his collection. Then he found 13 shells and lost 5 shells. So, now he has... (calculate)...bullets left in his collection. Therefore, the answer is 22 - 13 + 5 = 14 bullets.;
Response:  If Josh had 15 marbles in his collection and found 9 of them, then he lost 6 marbles (15 - 9 = 6). So, he lost more marbles than he found. Therefore, the answer is 6.;
Response:  If Josh had 3 marbles in his collection and found 6 more, then he now has 3 + 6 = 9 marbles. However, if he lost 5 marbles, then he only has 9 - 5 = 4 marbles left. So, he gained 4 marbles from those he lost.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 4 kilograms of jagodes, then each of them has half of that amount (2 kg). Since Marco's jagodes are heavier than his father's by 3 times, Marco's jagodes weigh 3 x 2 = 6 kg more than his father's. Therefore, Marco's jagodes weigh 6 + 2 = 8 kg in total. So, Marco's jagodes are 8/4 = 2 kg heavier than his father's.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 35 pounds of apples (which is equal to 35 x 4.5 = 157.5 pounds), then Marco has 13 pounds of apples. So, if we subtract Marco's weight from the total weight of apples, we get: 157.5 - 13 = 144.5 pounds. Therefore, Ocee's apples are heavier than Marco's by 144.5 pounds.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have collected jagodes that are heavy 20 pounds (funti), then each of their jagodes must be heavy 1/20th of that amount or 1 pound (funt).  Therefore, Marco's jagodse weight 5 kilograms (kg) which is equal to 5 x 0.453592 = 2.26798 pounds (lbs).;
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father's jagodas is equal to the sum of their individual weights. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total Weight = Jagoda Marca + Jagoda Tate  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total Weight = 8 funta + 32 funte  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Total Weight = 40 funte  Therefore, together, Marco and his father have jagodes that are 40 pounds heavy.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 24 kilograms of heavy apples (which is equal to 53 pounds), then Marco must have lost 5 kilograms or 11 pounds of those apples during their journey back home. So now, if Marco has 3 funts of apples left, that means he has 3 x 7 = 21 pounds of apples left with him. Now we can calculate how much did Marco's father have initially:  Initially, Marco's father had 24 - 5 = 19 kilograms or 42 pounds of apples.;
Response:  If Marco and his dad together collected 48 pounds (36 + 12) of apples, then his father lost 2 pounds of apples during their journey back home. So, now Marco has 12 pounds of apples left. Therefore, the weight of apples his father had before losing any was 40 pounds = 40 x 2 = 80 pounds.;
Response:  If Marco and his dad together collected 22 kilos of heavy berries while they were out picking, then when his father found an additional 30 pounds of berries on their way back home, the total weight of the berries that Marco and his father picked would be: 22 + 30 = 52 pounds. So, now the weight of the berries that Marco's father has is 52 pounds.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have collected 37 pounds of jagodes, then the weight of each jagod is: $ \frac {37}{2} = 18.5$ pounds per jagod. Since Marco had one jagod that weighed 15 pounds, his father must have had $\frac{18.5-15}{2}$ pounds of jagods, or $9$ pounds. Therefore, the weight of each jagod his father had was $9$.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have collected 17 pounds of jagodes (which is equal to 30 funti), then the weight of Marco's jagodes must be: $ \frac {17}{2} = 8.5$ pounds $ $ Therefore, Marco's jagodes are heavier than his father's by $ 8.5 - 30 = -21.5 $ pounds.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have collected 26 pounds of apples (which is equal to 26 x 4 = 104 pounds), then Marco must have had 4/5 of that amount, or 80 pounds (104 / 5 = 80). Therefore, Marco's father must have had 3/5 of that amount, or 24 pounds (80 / 5 = 24). So, Marco's father's apples were 24 pounds heavier than Marco's.;

Marco i njegov tata su otišli skupljati jagode. Jagode Marka oca su teške 4 kg. ako zajedno njihove jagode teже 30 funti. Koliko su teške Marcoove jagode?

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer:
Let's think step by step.
We know that Marco and his father together collected 30 pounds of jagods (in English ""fruits"").
The weight of Marco's jagods is given as 4 kg.
So, we can calculate the weight of Marco's jagods as follows:
Weight of Marco's jagods = Total weight of jagods - Weight of jagods of Marco's father
= 30 lb - 4 kg
= 26 kg

Therefore, the weight of Marco's jagods is 26 kilograms or 57.2 pounds.";
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus (the initial condition). Then, some more children entered the bus at the station (the event). So, now there are 10 children in the bus (the final state). To find out how many more children are in the bus than before the station, we need to subtract the number of children who entered the bus from the total number of children initially in the bus. Therefore, the answer is: 2 - X = 10, where X is the number of children who entered the bus at the station. Solving for X, we get X = 8. So, there are 8 more children in the bus than before the station.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 26 children on the bus and then another 38 children got on at the station. So, in total, we have:  Number of children on the bus = 26 Children getting off the bus = 0 Children already on the bus when they arrived at the station = 38 Total number of children on the bus = 26 + 38 = 64 Therefore, there are 64 children in the bus.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 children in the bus and then 2 more joined at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus before it stopped was:  Initially = 3 + 2 = 5 children. Therefore, there were 5 children in the bus before it stopped.;
Response:  We know that 43 children traveled in the bus and got off at the bus station. So, the number of children who remained in the bus is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who got off at the bus station.  Therefore, we can write: Number of children remaining in the bus = Total number of children - Number of children getting off at the bus station  In this case, the total number of children is given as 43, and the number of children getting off at the bus station is also given as 21. So, we can substitute these values into the equation above: Number of children remaining in the bus = 43 - 21 = 22  Therefore, there are 22 children who remained in the bus after all the others got off at the bus station.;
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then they got off at the station and left 18 children behind. So, initially, there were more than 18 children in the bus. Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 18.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 of them got off at the station, leaving 11 children still inside the bus. Finally, some more children boarded the bus at the station, bringing the total number to 16. Therefore, the number of children who entered the bus at the station is 11 - 10 = 1.;
Response:  We know that 63 children got off the bus at the station and some more got on board. So, the total number of children in the bus is: 63 + (some more) = x. Since there were 14 children inside the bus when it arrived at the station, we can write an equation: x - 14 = 63. Solving for x, we get: x = 77. Therefore, 77 more children entered the bus than got off.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 36 children in the bus. Then, 68 children got off at the station, leaving 12 children inside the bus. So, the total number of children who left the bus is 68 - 36 = 32. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and entered the bus is 32 - 12 = 20. Hence, 20 more children got off the bus than entered it.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children on the bus and then 40 children got off at the station. So, the total number of children who got off the bus is 40 - 22 = 18. Now, we are told that some children entered the bus as well. However, we don't know how many children entered the bus because it doesn't affect our calculation. Therefore, the final number of children inside the bus is still 2 + 18 = 20. So, the number of children who exited the bus at the station is 20 - 2 = 18.;
Response:  We know that 28 children traveled in the bus and 82 children got into the bus at the station. So, the total number of children who were in the bus is: 28 + 82 = 110 children. Now, we are told that some children got off the bus, but it doesn't say how many. So, let's assume that 5 children got off the bus. Therefore, the final number of children who remained in the bus is: 110 - 5 = 105 children.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus and then 4 more got on (since 24 children boarded the bus while some got off). So, the total number of children in the bus at one point was 23 + 4 = 27. Then, 8 children got off the bus, leaving us with 27 - 8 = 19 children inside the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 19 - 23 = -4 children.;
Response:  If Pećar has made 133 kolači and he sold 51 of them, then we know that he still has 82 kolači left (133 - 51 = 82). Now, let's assume that Baker has also made some kolači. We don't know how many exactly, but we can say that Baker has made more than Pećar because he sold 51 kolači more than Pećar did. So, if Baker has made x kolači, then he must have sold at least 51 + x kolači. Since Pećar has 82 kolači left after selling 51, it means that Baker has sold at most 82 - 51 = 31 kolači more than Pećar. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolači Baker has made and the number of kolači Pećar has made is equal to 31. In other words, Baker has made 31 + x = 164 kolači (since Pećar has made 133 kolači). So, Baker has made at least 164 - 133 = 31 more kolači than Pećar.;
"Response:  If Pećar made 54 kolači and sold some of them, then he has X kolači left. We know that X is greater than or equal to 13 (the number of kolači he sold), so we can write the equation:
X >= 13
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 13 +...
We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of X, but we can narrow it down to a range based on the given constraints. Since Pećar sold some of his kolači, he must have had at least 13 kolači left after selling some. Therefore, the minimum possible value of X is 13. So, the answer is:
X = 13
Therefore, Pećar sold 13 kolači.";
Response:  We know that Pećnica has made 145 kolači and sold them all. So, if she has still 72 kolača left, it means that she must have made initially more than 72 kolača. Therefore, we can conclude that Pećnica has made 72 + x kolača where x is an unknown number. Since she has sold all of them, the total number of kolači that Pećnica has made is equal to the number of kolači she has left: 72 + x = 72. Solving for x, we get x = 140. So, Pećnica has made 140 kolači in total.;
Response:  If Pećar made 155 kolača and his friend bought 140 of them from him, then Baker will have 15 - 14 = 1 more kolač than his friend. So, Baker has 160 kolača in total (155 + 1).;
Response:  If Pećar made 121 kolač and sold 105 of them, then he has 16 (121 - 105) kolač left.  Then, if he bought 170 new kolača, he now has 34 (16 + 170) kolač in total. So, Baker still has 34 kolač left.;
Response:  If he made 13 cakes and sold 91, then he has 91 - 13 = 78 left. He also bought 154 new tarts, so he has 78 + 154 = 232 new tarts. So, he has more tarts than he sold, which means he has 232 - 91 = 141 extra tarts that he didn't sell. Therefore, he has 141 more tarts than he sold.;
Response:  If he sold 78 kolači and bought 31 new ones, then the total number of kolači he had was 78 + 31 = 109. So, if he made 170 kolači in total, then he must have sold more than he bought. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolači he sold (78) and the number he bought (31) is equal to the number of kolači he made minus the number he sold: 109 - 78 = 31. So, he sold 31 more kolači than he bought.;
Response:  If Pećar has made 110 kolača and sold 75 of them, that means he still has 35 kolača left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, when he made another 76 kolača, he now has a total of 35 + 76 = 111 kolača. So, Baker would have 111 kolača left.;
Response:  The pastry chef made 144 cookies and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 cookies. So, the total number of cookies that the pastry chef made is: 144 + 111 = 255 cookies. Therefore, the pastry chef made 193 more cookies than those he sold (255 - 71 = 193).;
Response:  If Pećar has made 149 kolača and 91 peciva, then he has sold x kolača (since he has 10 left to sell). Therefore, the number of kolači he still has is 149 - x. Since he has also sold 90 peciva, the number of peciva he still has is 91 - (90 / 2) = 91 - 45 = 46. So, Baker would have 46 kolača left if he sells 10 more.;
Response:  If Pećar made 7 kolači and 148 peciva, then he sold 15 kolači and 103 peciva. So, if we subtract the number of pieces that he sold from the total number of pieces he made, we get: Number of pieces Baker has = Total number of pieces made - Number of pieces sold = 148 + 103 = 251 pieces. Therefore, Baker has 251 peciva left.;
"Response:  We know that Pećar has made more kolači than peciva. So, if he sold 115 kolači and 81 peciva, then he must have had more kolači than peciva at first. Therefore, we can say that:

Kolači = Total number of kolači - Number of kolači sold
Peciva = Total number of peciva - Number of peciva sold

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations:

Kolači = 126 - 115 = 11
Peciva = 48 - 81 = -33

So, there are 11 more kolači than peciva that Pećar made.";
Response:  We know that Pećar has made 19 kolača and 131 peciva. If he sold 70 kolača, then he had 29 kolača left (19 - 70 = 29). Now we need to find out how many more kolači Pećar has than the ones he sold. So, if he sold 88 kolača, then he has 29 - 88 = 51 more kolača than the ones he sold. Therefore, Pećar has 51 more kolača than the ones he sold.;
Response:  According to the question, Pekar made 157 kolača and 169 peciva. If he sold 158 kolača and 147 peciva, then he sold more kolača than peciva. So, the number of kolača that Pekar sold is greater than the number of peciva he sold by 9 (158 - 147 = 9). Therefore, Pekar sold 9 more kolača than peciva.;
Response:  We know that Pećar has made 54 kolača and 143 peciva. If he sold 68 kolača, then he still has 46 kolača left (54 - 68 = 46). And if he also sold 92 more kolača, then he now has 0 kolača left (46 + 92 = 138), since he cannot have negative amount of kolača. Therefore, Pećar has sold more kolača than he had initially. So, the answer is: More kolača than he had initially.;
Response:  If Pećar initially made 48 kolača and sold 44 of them, then he still has 4 x 4 = 16 kolača left. So, Pećar now has 48 - 16 = 32 kolača.;
Response:  If Pećar initially made 40 kolači and sold 8 of them, then he has 32 kolači left (40 - 8 = 32). So, he produced more than the number of kolači he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolači he produced and the number he sold is 32 - 8 = 24 kolači.;
Response:  If Pećarov has initially made 169 kolači and his friend buys 137 of them, then he still has 32 kolači left (169 - 137 = 32).;
Response:  We know that Pećar made 173 cakes and bought 103 new tarts. He sold 86 of them. So, he still has 103 - 86 = 17 cakes left. Therefore, Baker still has 17 cakes.;
Response:  If Pećar made 99 kolača and bought 167 new ones, that means he has a total of 266 kolača (99 + 167). Then, if he sold 89 kolača, he has left with 177 kolača (266 - 89). So, he bought more kolači than he sold. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More than 89.;
Response:  If Pećar made 8 kolači and bought 139 new ones, that means he has a total of 147 kolači (8 + 139). Then, if he sold 145 kolači, we can calculate the difference between the number of kolači he sold and the number of kolači he had as follows:  Difference = Sold - Had = 145 - 147 = -2 = 0 So, Pećar did not sell any more kolači than those he bought.;
Response:  If Pećar made 62 kolači and then made another 149 kolači, that means he has a total of 211 kolači (62 + 149).  Then, if he sold 144 pieces, that means he still has 67 kolači left (211 - 144 = 67). So, Baker still has 67 kolači left.;
Response:  The pastry chef made 81 rolls and then made another 92 rolls. If he sold 46 packages of rolls, that means he has 92 - 46 = 46 more rolls left over than he sold. So, the number of rolls the pastry chef made is equal to the number of rolls he sold plus the number of rolls he still has left over, which is 46 in this case. Therefore, the answer is 46 + 81 = 127 rolls.;
Response:  If Pećar has made 61 kolač and 167 kolača, then he has in total 228 kolača (61 + 167).  If he sold 108 kolača, then he still has 120 kolača left (228 - 108).  Now, if Baker bought 44 kolača from Pećar, then Baker now has 120 kolača (120 - 44) and Pećar is left with none (0).;
Response:  We know that Pećar has made 56 rolls and 124 rolls in total. If he sold 104 rolls, then he must have had some left over. So, let's find out how many rolls Baker still has. To do this, we need to subtract the number of rolls Pećar sold from the total number of rolls he made. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of rolls Baker still has = Total number of rolls made - Number of rolls sold = 124 - 104 = 20;
Response:  We know that Pećar has made 52 kolača and 84 kolača in total. If he sold 102 kolača, then he must have had some left over to sell. So let's subtract the number of kolača he sold from the number of kolača he made: 52 + 84 = 136. Since he sold 102 kolača, we can see that he had 34 kolača (136 - 102) more than he made. Therefore, Pećar has 34 kolača more than he made.;
Response:  If Pećar made 134 kolača and sold 140 kolača, then he has 6 kolača left over (140 - 134 = 6).  If he also sold 92 kolača, then he has an additional 8 kolača left over (92 - 6 = 8), for a total of 14 kolača more than he made (8 + 6 = 14). Therefore, Pećar produced and sold a total of 154 kolača (134 + 14 = 154).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pećar has made 14 kolači and 153 peciva. If he sold 8 kolači, then he had 6 kolači left (14 - 8 = 6). Now, let's find out how many kolači he sold. He sold 97 kolači more than the number of kolači he had left. So, if he had 6 kolači left, then he sold 97 x 6 = 580 kolači in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolači he sold and the number of kolači he had is 580 - 6 = 574 kolači.;
Response:  We know that Pećar made 43 kolača and 114 peciva. If he sold 154 kolača, then he must have had more than 43 kolača left over to sell. So, the number of kolača Pećar has is: 43 + (154 - 43) = 90 kolača. Now we need to find out how many kolača Baker sold. According to the question, Baker sold 78 kolača more than Pećar. Therefore, the number of kolača Baker sold is: 90 (Pećar's kolači) + 78 = 168 kolača. So, Baker sold 168 kolača more than Pećar.;
Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she wants to have 140 games in total, then we need to find out how many more games she needs to buy. To do this, we can divide the number of games she wants (140) by the number of games she already has (22): Number of additional games = 140 - 22 = 118 So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to reach her goal of having 140 games in total.;
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she decides to give away 64 of them, then she will have 42 remaining (106 - 64 = 42).;
Response:  If Kelly had 91 Nintendo games at first and she still has 92 matches left, that means she played 91 + 92 = 183 matches with those games. So, initially, she must have had x = 183 games.;
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly will have left if she gives away 12 of them, we can use the following formula: Number of Nintendo games left = Total number of Nintendo games - Number of Nintendo games given away Total number of Nintendo games = 20 (Kelly already has) - 12 (number of Nintendo games to be given away) = 8 So, Kelly will have 8 Nintendo games left after giving away 12 of them.;
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she will have left after giving away 31 Sony games, we can use the following calculation: Number of Sony games remaining = Total number of Sony games - Number of Sony games given away Total number of Sony games = 132 - 31 = 101 Therefore, Kelly will have 101 Sony games left after giving away 31 Sony games.;
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 more, then she now has a total of 111 games. To find out how many she will have left after giving away 6 games, we can subtract 6 from 111: 111 - 6 = 105. So, Kelly will have 105 Nintendo games left after giving away 6 games.;
Response:  If Randy has 52 blocks to build a tower and he uses 38 of them at first, then he must have had 14 blocks left initially (52 - 38 = 14).;
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he wants to build a tower. If he uses some of these blocks to build the tower, then he will have less than 97 blocks left. So let's say he used x blocks to build the tower. Then we can write an equation:  Number of blocks left = 97 - x. To find out how many blocks Randy used to build the tower, we need to solve this equation for x.  Substituting the value given in the problem (x = 72), we get:  Number of blocks left = 97 - 72 = 25. Therefore, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.;
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total and he used 14 blocks to build the tower. Therefore, the number of blocks left for building the house is:

79 - 14 = 65 blocks

So, there are 65 blocks remaining after building the tower and the house.";
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total and he used 27 blocks to build the tower. So, the number of blocks left is: 58 - 27 = 31. Now we need to find out how many blocks Randy used to build the house. According to the question, Randy used 53 blocks to build the house. Therefore, the number of blocks Randy used to build both the tower and the house is: 31 + 53 = 84.;
Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks and he used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. So we can write this as an equation: 33 + 13 = 46. Therefore, Randy used 46 blocks more for building the tower than for building the house.;
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks in total and he used 79 blocks to build the tower and 82 blocks to build the house. So, we can write an equation as follows: Blocks used for building the tower = 79 Blocks used for building the house = 82 - 79 = 3 Therefore, Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did for the tower.;
Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks to build a tower and he uses all of them, then he will have used up all his blocks. So, if he had 59 blocks in total, that means he had 23 blocks left over after building the tower (59 - 36 = 23).;
Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks in total and he used 20 blocks to build the house and 50 blocks to build the tower. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building the tower = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for building the house To find out how many more blocks were used for building the tower than for building the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for building the house from the total number of blocks. Therefore, the answer is: More blocks used for building the tower = 50 - 20 = 30 blocks.;
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks in total and he used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the tower. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for building the house = 89 Number of blocks used for building the tower = 63 Now, we need to find out how many more blocks were used for building the house than for building the tower. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for building the tower from the number of blocks used for building the house: More blocks used for building the house = 89 - 63 = 26 Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.;
"Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series ""Ludak, glup, škola"". If we have already read 5 of them, then we have read 5/20 = 1/4 or 25% of the total number of books in the series.";
"Response:  If you have read 13 books in the series and there are 8 more to go, then the total number of books in the series is:  13 + 8 = 21 books. Therefore, there are 21 books in the ""Ludak, glup, škola"" series.";
Response:  We know that there are 22 books in the series and we have read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books we need to read, we can subtract the number of books we have already read from the total number of books: 22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, we still need to read 10 more books from the series. Similarly, for films, we know that there are 10 films and we have watched 56 of them. Subtracting the number of films we have watched from the total number of films gives us the remaining number of films to watch: 10 - 56 = -46. Since negative numbers cannot be used in this context, we will round up to zero, meaning that we have already watched all the available films in the series.;
Response:  If there are 4 books and 17 films in the series, that means there are 4 x 7 = 28 items in total. So if you have read 19 books and watched 7 films, then you still need to watch 28 - 7 = 21 more films. Therefore, you need to watch 21 more films from the series.;
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""Ludak, Glupa Škola"". So, if we have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, it means that we have more books than movies. In other words, we have 19 - 13 = 6 more books than movies. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.";
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"". So, if we have read 19 books and watched 61 films, then the number of films is greater than the number of books by 42 (61 - 19). Therefore, there are 42 more films than books in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"".";
"Response:  If we have 10 books and 11 movies in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"", that means we have a total of 10 + 11 = 21 items in the series.  If we have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, it means we have read more books than movies. So, the difference between the number of books read and movies watched is 13 - 12 = 1. Therefore, we are one book ahead in terms of reading compared to watching movies.";
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series ""Dumb and Dumber"". If we have read 7 books and watched 21 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies we have watched than books as follows:

Movies watched - Books read = 21 - 7 = 14

So, we have watched 14 more movies than books in the series ""Dumb and Dumber"".";
Response:  If there are 8 books in the series that you have already read, and there are a total of 14 books in the series, then we can calculate how many more books you need to read as follows: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read = 14 - 8 = 6 So, you still need to read 6 more books from the series.;
"Response:  We know that there are 62 movies and 19 books in the series ""Ludak, Glupa Škola"". If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies, then you still need to read 58 more books (62 - 4 = 58).";
"Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series ""Ludak, Glupa Škola"". If we have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then we still need to watch 3 more movies (since 4 - 7 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.";
Response:  We know that there are 11 books in the series and we have read 11 of them. Therefore, there is one book left to be read.  Now, let's count the number of movies in the series. According to the question, there are 40 movies in total. So, if we have watched 11 movies, then there are 39 movies left to watch.  Therefore, the difference between the number of books read and the number of movies watched is 1 (one).;
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""Ludak, Glupa Škola"". If we have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, then the number of movies is greater than the number of books by how many?  To find out, let's subtract the number of books from the number of movies: 63 - 11 = 52 movies more than books. Therefore, there are 52 more movies than books in the series ""Ludak, Glupa Škola"".";
"Response:  We are given that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"". If we have read 14 films and watched 19 books, then we have read more books than films. To find out how many more books we have read, we can subtract the number of films from the total number of books:  Number of books read = Total number of books - Number of films  In this case, the total number of books is 19 (since we have watched 19), and the number of films is 6, so:  Number of books read = 19 - 6 = 13  Therefore, we have read 13 more books than films.";
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series ""Ludak, glupa škola"". If we have read 19 films and 16 books, it means that we have watched more movies than we have read books. So, the number of movies we have watched is greater than the number of books we have read. To find out how many more movies we have watched, we can subtract the number of books we have read from the total number of movies:  Number of movies we have watched = Total number of movies - Number of books we have read  In this case, the total number of movies is 5, and the number of books we have read is 16, so:  Number of movies we have watched = 5 - 16 = -11  Therefore, we have watched 11 more movies than we have read books.";
Response:  If Dave has already won 7 tickets and he still has 2 cards left, that means he used 5 cards to buy the game pieces. So, he used 5 cards for buying the game pieces.;
Response:  If Dave has already spent 12 entrance tickets to buy some toys and he still has 14 remaining tickets, then we can conclude that he must have won at least 14 - 12 = 2 more entrance tickets as a prize in the game. Therefore, Dave has won 2 additional entrance tickets.;
Response:  If Dave has won 18 tickets and he used 5 for toys and 11 for clothes, then we can say that the number of tickets Dave had is equal to 18 - (5 + 11) = 18 - 16 = 2. So, Dave had 2 tickets left after buying toys and clothes.;
Response:  We know that Dave has won 19 tickets in total. He used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 tickets to buy clothes. To find out how many more tickets Dave used for buying toys than for buying clothes, we can divide the number of tickets he used for buying toys (12) by the number of tickets he used for buying clothes (7):  Number of more tickets used for buying toys = 12 / 7 = 1  So, Dave used 1 more ticket to buy toys than he did to buy clothes.;
Response:  If Dave has won $13 and he spent $8 to buy some toys and $18 to buy clothes, then we can write this as follows:  $13 - $8 = $5 (the amount of money Dave had left after buying toys) $5 - $18 = -$13 (the amount of money Dave spent on clothes) So, Dave spent more money on clothes than he had left after buying toys. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is $13.;
Response:  If Dave has won $14 and lost $2, that means he has $12 left.  If he uses $10 to buy some toys, then he will have $2 left. So, the answer is $2.;
Response:  If Haley has grown 14 apple trees in her backyard and after Tornado 9 killed them all, then there were initially 14 apple trees. Now, we need to find out how many of those trees survived the tornado. So, if 9 apple trees died in the tornado, that means 5 (14 - 9) apple trees survived it. Therefore, 5 apple trees survived the tornado.;
"Response:  If Haley has grown 13 apple trees in her backyard and after Tyrone died (Tyrone is assumed to have killed 6 of them), then we can calculate how many apple trees survived the storm as follows:

Number of apple trees that survived = Total number of apple trees - Number of apple trees killed by Tyrone
= 13 - 6
= 7
Therefore, 7 apple trees survived the storm.";
Response:  If Haley planted 20 stalks in the courtyard and after the typhoon 4 stalks remained, then we can calculate how many stalks were destroyed as follows: Number of stalks that were destroyed = Total number of stalks - Number of stalks remaining After the typhoon = 20 - 4 = 16 So, 16 stalks were destroyed in the typhoon.;
Response:  If Haley planted 10 trees in the courtyard and after Tornado 5 died, then there are 7 remaining trees (10 - 3 = 7). Now, if Haley grew another tree, then the total number of trees she has grown is 8 (7 + 1 = 8). So, the answer is 8.;
Response:  If Haley had already grown 9 trees in her courtyard before Tornado 4 killed them all, then she planted 5 more after that. So, the total number of trees Haley grew is: 9 + 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 trees left.;
Response:  At first, Hayley had 12 apple trees in her orchard. After two of them were destroyed, she had 10 apple trees left (12 - 2 = 10). So, to answer your question, Hayley still has 10 apple trees in her orchard.;
Response:  Initially, there were 3 trees in Hayley's courtyard. After the typhoon, 13 trees were destroyed. So, the number of surviving trees is: 3 - 13 = -10. Therefore, 10 more trees died than survived in the typhoon.;
Response:  Initially, Hayley planted 11 stalks of corn in her backyard. After the tornado hit and destroyed 2 of them, there were 9 remaining stalks. So, the number of surviving stalks was 9.;
Response:  If he saw how many watermelons are being harvested daily and found out that there are 66 baskets per day, then we can calculate how many watermelons are collected daily as follows: Number of watermelons = Total number of baskets / Number of watermelons in each basket So, if there are 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 28 watermelons, then the total number of watermelons collected daily is: Number of watermelons = 66 baskets / 28 watermelons per basket = 240 watermelons per day;
Response:  If they are collecting 8 baskets of oranges per day, and we want to collect 24 baskets in total, then we need to know how many days it will take us to collect that amount. So, if it takes them 1 day to collect 8 baskets, then it will take us x days to collect 24 baskets. Therefore, the answer is x = 3 days.;
Response:  If he went to see how the wheat is growing and found out that it will take another 4 days for the harvest, then we can calculate how many baskets of wheat they collect daily if they collect a total of 56 baskets of wheat.  To do this, we need to divide the total number of baskets by the number of days left until the harvest. So, in this case, we have: Total number of baskets = 56 Baskets Daily = Total number of baskets / Number of days left until harvest = 56 baskets / 4 days = 14 baskets per day;
"Response:  If he picks 38 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 42 oranges, then after 49 days he will have picked a total of:

38 x 42 = 1657 oranges per day

So, after 49 days, he will have picked a total of:

1657 x 49 = 80,630 oranges";
"Response:  After 87 days of harvesting, if each day they collect 66 baskets of oranges and each basket contains 25 oranges, then in total they will have collected:

$$ \text {Total number of oranges after 87 days} = \text{Number of baskets per day} \times \text{Number of days} $$

So, we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of oranges after 87 days} &= 66 \times 87 \\&= 5,730 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, the pomander will have approximately $5,730$ oranges.";
Response:  If he collects 8 baskets of oranges every day and each basket contains 35 oranges, then he collects in total 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.;
"Response:  If he is collecting 16 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 57 oranges, then in one day he will collect:

16 x 57 = 902 oranges per day

Now, to find out how many days it will take to collect 80 baskets of oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number collected per day:

902 oranges/day ÷ 80 baskets = 11.3 days

Therefore, it will take approximately 11.3 days to collect 80 baskets of oranges if he continues to collect at the same rate.";
Response:  If they collect 67 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 12 oranges, then they collect 804 oranges per day (67 x 12 = 804). To find out how many oranges are collected in total if they collect 35 baskets of oranges, we can multiply the number of days by the number of baskets collected per day:  Total number of oranges = Number of days x Number of baskets collected per day  Total number of oranges = 35 x 804 = 28,200 oranges. Therefore, they collect 28,200 oranges in total if they collect 35 baskets of oranges.;
Response:  After 51 days of picking oranges, if they collect 74 baskets per day and reject 71 baskets per day, then the total number of baskets collected will be:  Total collection = Daily collection x Number of days  Total collection = 74 x 51 = 3690 baskets  Therefore, after 51 days of berrying, the orange tree will have approximately 3690 baskets.;
Response:  If he saw that 76 baskets are collected daily and discarded 64 of them, then we know that the number of baskets collected is equal to 76 - 64 = 12. So, they collect 12 baskets per day.;
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, there will be 28 x 26 = 784 vreća mature oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 vreća immature oranges. So, in total, after 26 days of harvesting, there will be 784 + 1328 = 2112 vreća oranges.;
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, we know that there are currently 82 vreće zrele pomorandže (mature mussels). To find out how many vreća zrele pomorandže will be left after 25 days, we need to calculate the daily growth rate of mature mussels and apply it to the initial number of vreća zrele pomorandže. The daily growth rate of mature mussels is given as 61 vreća nezrelih pomorandža (unsorted mussels) per day. Therefore, the total number of vreća zrele pomorandže after 25 days can be calculated as follows: Number of vreća zrele pomorandže after 25 days = Initial number of vreća zrele pomorandže x Daily growth rate of mature mussels / Total number of vreća unsorted mussels per day  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of vreća zrele pomorandže after 25 days = 82 vreći x (61 vreća nezrelih pomorandža / 82 vreći) x (1 / 0.75) = 49.3 vreći After 25 days, there will be approximately 49.3 vreća zrele pomorandže left.;
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, there will be 24 vreća (verece) of unripe oranges. Since each vreća contains 4 kg of unripe oranges, we can calculate the total amount of unripe oranges as follows: Number of vreća = 24 Vreća = 4 kg/vreća x 24 vreća = 96 kg of unripe oranges.;
Response:  We know that he saw how many oranges were growing in each of those 69 rows. So, we can write down an equation based on what is given in the problem: Number of zesty oranges = 44 + 25 = 69 Total number of oranges = Number of zesty oranges + Number of unripe oranges = 69 + 25 = 94 Now we have to find out how many more zesty oranges than unripe ones are grown daily. To do this, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the total number of oranges: Number of zesty oranges per day = Total number of oranges - Number of unripe oranges = 94 - 25 = 69 Therefore, there are 69 more zesty oranges than unripe ones grown daily.;
"Response:  We know that there are 74 vreća of unripe oranges collected daily and 5 vreća of ripe oranges collected daily. To find out how many more vreća of unripe oranges are collected than ripe oranges, we can subtract the number of ripe oranges from the total number of unripe oranges:

Total number of unripe oranges = 74 vreća
Number of ripe oranges = 5 vreća
Difference between unripe and ripe oranges = Total number of unripe oranges - Number of ripe oranges
= 74 vreća - 5 vreća
= 69 vreća
Therefore, there are 69 more vreća of unripe oranges collected than ripe oranges each day.";
"Response:  If they collected 54 baskets of oranges in total, and they collected 18 baskets per day, then we can calculate how many days it took them to collect all those oranges as follows:

Total number of baskets = 54
Number of baskets per day = 18
Days taken to collect all baskets = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets per day
= 54 / 18
= 3
Therefore, it took them 3 days to collect all 54 baskets of oranges.";
Response:  If they collected 56 vreća of oranges in total and they went to see how many days it took them to collect that amount, then we can assume that they collected one vreća per day. So, if they collected 56 vreća in total, then they must have collected 56/days = x vreća per day, where x is the number of days they collected oranges. Since they collected oranges for 14 days, then x = 14. Therefore, they collected 14 vreća of oranges per day.;
Response:  We know that there are currently 5 vreća zrelih naranča per day. After 73 days of harvesting, we will have: 5 x 73 = 365 vreća zrelih naranča. So, after 73 days, there will be 365 vreća zrelih pomorandža.;
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, we know that there are currently 65 vreća unripe oranges and 46 vreća ripe oranges per day. To find out how many vreća unripe oranges will have after 6 days of harvesting, we can use the following formula: Number of vreća unripe oranges after 6 days = Total number of vreća unripe oranges x (1 + Daily increase in vreća unripe oranges) ^ 6 We know that the daily increase in vreća unripe oranges is equal to the total number of vreća unripe oranges divided by the number of days since the beginning of harvesting. So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of vreća unripe oranges after 6 days = 65 vreća x (1 + 65/7) ^ 6 = 230 vreća Therefore, after 6 days of harvesting, there will be approximately 230 vreća unripe oranges.;
Response:  We know that there are 86 vreća zrelih naranča and 41 vreća nezrelih naranča per day. So, we can write this as an equation:  Number of zrele pomorandže = 86 vreće/day Number of nezrele pomorandže = 41 vreće/day Now, let's find out how many more zrele than nezrele pomorandže are produced each day: Difference between number of zrele and nezrele pomorandže = Number of zrele pomorandže - Number of nezrele pomorandže = $86-41= $45$ Therefore, there are $45$ more zrele pomorandže than nezrele pomorandže produced each day.;
"Response:  If he discovered 71 vreća (baskets) of unripe oranges and 60 vreća of ripe oranges per day, we can calculate how many more baskets of unripe oranges are collected daily as follows:

More unripe oranges = Total unripe oranges - Total ripe oranges
= 71 vreća - 60 vreća
= 11 vreća

Therefore, there are 11 more baskets of unripe oranges collected daily than ripe oranges.";
Response:  So, we know that the length of Jessejeva's room is 12 meters and its width is 11 meters. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we can use the following formula: Length = Width x 2 + Height. Since we are given that the height of the room is 4 meters, we can plug in these values into the formula to get: Length = 11 x 2 + 4 = 25 meters. Therefore, Jessejeva's room is 25 meters long compared to its width of 11 meters.;
Response:  We know that the length of the sofa is 2 meters and we need to find out how wide it is. So, if the length of the sofa is 2 meters, then its width (or breadth) must be half of that value, which is 1 meter. Therefore, the width of the sofa is 1 meter. Now, let's convert this value from meters to square feet. There are 0.93 square feet in one meter, so the width of the sofa is equal to 1 meter x 0.93 square feet/meter = 0.93 square meters. Finally, since there are 14 square feet in one square meter, we can convert the width of the sofa from square meters to square feet as follows: 0.93 square meters x 14 square feet/square meter = 12.56 square feet. Therefore, the width of the sofa is approximately 12.56 square feet.;
Response:  We know that the length of the room is 2 meters (or 6 feet). To find out how long it is in square feet, we divide its length in meters by 0.3048 (the number of square feet in one meter). So, the length of the room in square feet is: 2 meters x 0.3048 = 609.6 square feet. Now, we are asked to find out how many square feet the room is wide. Since we were given that the width of the room is 14 times the length of the room, we can multiply the length of the room by 14 to get the width: 609.6 square feet x 14 = 8791.6 square feet. Therefore, the dimensions of the room are 609.6 square feet long and 8791.6 square feet wide.;
"Response:  We know that the length of the room is 3 + 4 = 7 meters. Since we have 16 square feet of carpet already laid out, let's assume that each square foot covers an area of 0.125 square meters (this is just an approximation, as the actual size may vary depending on the thickness and density of the carpet). Therefore, the total area covered by all the carpet already laid out is:

Area = Length x Width = 7 m x 0.125 m/ft = 0.875 square meters
Now, to find out how much more carpet needs to be laid down to cover the entire floor, we need to subtract the area already covered from the total area of the room:

Total Area - Covered Area = Room Area - Carpet Area = 10.925 square meters - 0.875 square meters = 10.05 square meters
Therefore, approximately 10.05 square meters of additional carpet are needed to cover the entire floor.";
Response:  We know that the length of the room is 2 meters and its width is 12 meters. To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of each tile. The area of each tile can be calculated as follows: Area of each tile = Length x Width = 4 square steps So, if there are n tiles in total, then the number of tiles needed to cover the entire floor is equal to the area of the room divided by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of room / Area of each tile = 2 x 12 = 24 tiles Therefore, you would need 24 tiles to cover the entire floor of the room.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 steps in length and 18 steps in width of each room. So, to cover all the floors with carpeting, we need to calculate how many meters of carpeting we need for each floor.  To do this, we can use the formula: Length x Width = Area of one room. Therefore, the area of one room is: 19 steps x 18 steps = 342 square meters. Now, since there are 20 rooms in total, we need to multiply the area of one room by the number of rooms to get the total area of carpeting needed: 342 square meters x 20 rooms = 6,840 square meters. Finally, to convert square meters to meters, we divide by 10 (since there are 10 meters in one square meter): 6,840 / 10 = 684 meters.;
Response:  So, we know that the length of the room is 20 meters and its width is 19 meters. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we can use the following formula: Length = Width x Height. Since we are given that the height of the room is 4 meters, we can plug in these values into the formula to get: Length = 19 x 4 = 76 meters. Therefore, the room is 76 meters long, which is 56% longer than its width (19 meters).;
Response:  We know that Jesse needs to cover his room with carpet of size 10 square meters. Since we are given that the room is 5 feet long (which means it has length equal to 60 inches), we can calculate its width as follows: Width = Length / 3 = 60 in / 3 = 20 in So, the width of Jesse's room is 20 inches or 0.5 meters. Therefore, the area of the room is Area = Width x Height = 0.5 m x? = 0.5 square meters. Now, since Jesse wants to cover his room with carpet of size 10 square meters, we need to find out how much carpet he will need for each meter of the room's height. Carpet coverage per meter = Total area of carpet needed / Room's height = 0.5 m^2 /? = 0.005 square meters per meter.;
Response:  We know that Jesse needs to cover his room with a carpet of size 10 square meters. Since we are given that the room is rectangular in shape, we can assume that its length and width are equal (since it is a square). So, if the room is wide by 2 steps, then its length must be twice as long. Therefore, the length of the room is 4 steps, and its width is also 4 steps since they are equal. Now, we need to find out how many square meters the carpet covers. To do this, we multiply the length and width of the room:  Area of the room = length x width = 4 x 4 = 16 square meters.  Therefore, Jesse needs 16 square meters of carpet to cover his room.;
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet and his room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To find out how much more carpet he needs to cover the entire floor, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, so the area of the room is: Area = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet, he needs an additional 62 square feet (80 - 18) to cover the entire floor. Therefore, the answer is 62 square feet.;
Response:  We know that Zara's t-shirt shop made $23 from each sold shirt and during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech they sold 230 shirts. So, we can calculate how much money Zara's t-shirt shop made as follows:  Money earned = Number of shirts sold x Price per shirt  = 230 shirts x $23 per shirt  = $5,170  Therefore, Zara's t-shirt shop made $5,170 during the game.;
Response:  If Razorback Trgovina sold $51 worth of magic T-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas game, and they sold 3 T-shirts, then we can calculate the price of each T-shirt as follows: Price = Total value / Number of T-shirts = $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt.;
Response:  We know that Zara earned $87 for each sold t-shirt and they sold 95 t-shirts in total during both games. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game alone, then their revenue from selling t-shirts during that game would be:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt = 47 x $87 = $3,899.;
Response:  We know that Zara earned $106 for each sold t-shirt and they sold a total of 242 t-shirts during both games. So, if they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 127 t-shirts during the Texas game (242 - 115 = 127).;
Response:  We know that Zara earned $98 for each sold t-shirt and they sold 163 t-shirts in total during both games. So, if they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they earned $8572 ($98 x 89) from those sales.;
Response:  We know that Zara earned $78 for each sold t-shirt and they sold 186 t-shirts in total during both games. So, if they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they earn from selling those t-shirts?  Therefore, the answer is $78 x 172 = $13,040.;
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt sold, they make $99 and for each dress sold, they make $62. So if they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 dresses during the game, their total revenue from t-shirts would be:  Revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 183 x $99 = $17,570 And their total revenue from dresses would be: Revenue from dresses = Number of dresses x Price per dress = 31 x $62 = $1,933 Therefore, their total revenue from both t-shirts and dresses is: Total revenue = Revenue from t-shirts + Revenue from dresses = $17,570 + $1,933 = $19,493;
Response:  We know that they sold $74 in t-shirts and $156 in dresses during the game between Arkansas and Texas. So their total revenue from sales of clothing items is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of dresses x Price per dress  Revenue = 74 x $20 + 156 x $30  Revenue = $1,480  Therefore, they earned $1,480 from selling dresses during the game.;
Response:  We know that razorback shop makes $192 from each t-shirt and $34 from each dress. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 dresses. To find out how much more money they made from selling shirts than dresses, we can subtract the amount of money they made from selling dresses from the total amount of money they made from selling both shirts and dresses. So, if they made $192 x 157 = $29,690 from selling t-shirts and $34 x 19 = $658 from selling dresses, then they made $29,690 - $658 = $28,032 more from selling t-shirts than dresses. Therefore, the number of shirts sold is $28,032 / ($192 per shirt) = 145 shirts.;
"Response:  We know that razorback shop makes $86 per t-shirt and $232 per hoodie.  During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 hoodies. So, we can calculate how much more money they made from selling hoodies than t-shirts as follows:

$232 x 43 = $9700 (total revenue from hoodies)

$86 x 254 = $21,740 (total revenue from t-shirts)

So, the difference in revenue between hoodies and t-shirts is:

$9700 - $21,740 = $11,040

Therefore, the Razorback Shop made $11,040 more from selling hoodies than t-shirts during the game.";
Response:  The initial price of each t-shirt is $51. During the game, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. So, their total revenue from selling t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Original price per t-shirt + Discount amount per t-shirt x Number of t-shirts sold Total revenue = 130 x $51 + (130 x $8) = $6,930 + $1,040 = $7,970 Therefore, they earned $7,970 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the game.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Prodavnica sold each shirt for $201 during the game between Arkansas and Texas. Therefore, they earned total revenue of $201 x 14 = $2840 from selling 14 shirts.;
Response:  If they sold $60 worth of merchandise during the game, and each sale was $10, then they sold 6 games. So, they sold 6 x $10 = $60 worth of merchandise.;
"Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas, the Razorback merchandise sold $215 in total. If they sold 5 t-shirts, then we can calculate how much each t-shirt cost as follows:

$215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt";
Response:  We know that they sold $20 in t-shirts and $64 in hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas. So, their total revenue from these sales is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie  Revenue = 20 x $21 + 64 x $5  Revenue = $420 + $320  Revenue = $740  Therefore, they earned $740 from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game.;
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt sold, they earned $76 and for each jacket sold, they earned $204. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 158 shirts and 2 jackets. So, their total revenue from selling shirts is:  Revenue from shirts = Number of shirts x Price per shirt = 158 x $76 = $11,340 Their total revenue from selling jackets is: Revenue from jackets = Number of jackets x Price per jacket = 2 x $204 = $408 Total revenue from sales = Revenue from shirts + Revenue from jackets = $11,340 + $408 = $11,748 Therefore, they earned $11,748 from selling dresses during the game.;
"Response:  We know that the razorback shop makes $210 for each shirt and $240 for each jacket. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 177 dresses and 23 shirts. So, we can calculate how much more money they made from selling shirts than from selling dresses as follows:

Money made from selling shirts = Number of shirts sold x Price per shirt
= 177 x $210
= $36,970

Therefore, the razorback shop made $36,970 more from selling shirts than from selling dresses during the game between Arkansas and Texas.";
Response:  We know that razorback shop makes $115 for each shirt and $25 for each jacket. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 113 dresses and 78 shirts. So, we can calculate how much more money they made from selling shirts than dresses as follows:  Money made from shirts = Number of shirts x Price per shirt = 78 x $25 = $1900  Money made from dresses = Number of dresses x Price per dress = 113 x $115 = $13050  Therefore, the Razorback Shop made $13050 more from selling dresses than from selling shirts during the game.;
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 tables, then the total number of tables is 5 x 10 = 50 tables.;
Response:  If they have two sets of chairs with the same number of chairs in each set, then we can say that there are twice as many chairs as there are people playing the game. So, if there are 12 players playing the game, and they have two sets of chairs, then there must be 24 chairs in total (i.e., 12 x 2 = 24). Therefore, each player has half of the total number of chairs (i.e., 24 / 12 = 2).;
Response:  If there are 9 chairs in the courtyard and each table has 3 chairs, then we have: Number of tables = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per table = 9 / 3 = 3 tables. Therefore, they have 3 sets of chairs.;
Response:  If they have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then we can calculate how many chairs there are in total as follows:  Total number of chairs = Number of tables x Number of chairs per table  Total number of chairs = 11 x 13  Total number of chairs = 143 chairs.;
Response:  If they have 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  And if there are 11 people sitting at the tables, that means some people will be sitting without chairs. So, the number of free chairs is 60 - (11 x 2) = 40.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. However, we were also told that they have 6 more chairs than guests. Therefore, if they have X guests, then the total number of chairs would be 168 + 6 = 174 chairs. So, the answer is 174 chairs for the guests.;
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and each set of stools has 3 stools, then we need to buy an additional 2 stools (since 14 - 4 = 10). So, the answer is 2 more stools needed.;
Response:  If they have decided to hold the party in their backyard and they have 14 chairs for each chair, then they will need more than 9 chairs if they want to accommodate all of the guests. So, the number of extra chairs needed is 9 - 9 = 0. Therefore, they will have an equal number of chairs as there are guests.;
Response:  If Ako earns $460 for 5 weeks of harvesting and there are 7 days in a week...;
Response:  If Lewis earns $1216 during harvest, and he works for 8 weeks (as mentioned in the passage), then we can calculate his daily income as follows: Daily income = Total earned amount / Number of days worked = $1216 / 8 weeks = $152 per week Now, if he works for 8 weeks, that means he has worked for 1 month (since there are 4 weeks in a month). So, to find out how many days he worked, we need to multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week: Days worked = Weeks worked x Days in a week = 8 weeks x 7 days/week = 56 days Therefore, Lewis worked for 56 days during the harvest season.;
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks (a season), he will have earned $4,592 ($21 x 216). Now, if he has to pay $702 in taxes, his net income after taxes would be $3,890 ($4,592 - $702).;
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week during 223 weeks of harvest season, then he will earn:

$1357 x 223 = $294,011

If he works for 73 seasons instead of 223, his total earnings would be:

$294,011 x 73 = $20,687,333

Therefore, if Lewis works for 73 seasons instead of 223, he will earn $20,687,333.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $28 per week during the harvest season of 109 weeks. Additionally, he earns $939 per week for overtime work. To find out how much money he makes during the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings for that period. So, his total earnings during the harvest season are: Total earnings = Weekly income x Number of weeks in harvest season = $28 x 109 = $2,872 During this time, he works 40 hours per week, and since he works overtime, let's assume he works an additional 10 hours per week at $939 per hour. Therefore, his total earnings from working overtime during the harvest season are: Overtime earnings = Hours worked per week x Overtime rate = $10 x 40 = $400 So, his total earnings during the harvest season are: Total earnings = $2,872 + $400 = $3,272 Now, we want to know how much he earns each week during the harvest season for overtime work. To do this, we divide his total overtime earnings by the number of weeks he works overtime: Overtime earnings per week = Total overtime earnings / Number of weeks worked overtime = $400 / 10 = $40 per week Therefore, Lewis earns $40 per week for overtime work during the harvest season.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much money Lewis earns per month. Since he works for 233 days during the harvest season, his monthly income can be calculated as follows: $403 x 233 = $91,670 per year Now, let's calculate how much he has to pay in rent every month: $91,670 / 49 = $1,850 per month Therefore, Lewis has to pay $1,850 per month in rent.;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income from farming is:
$$ Total\text{ income} = \text{Weekly income} \times \text{Number of weeks} $$
$$= 368 \times 1359 $$
$$= 472,072 $$
Now, we are asked how much he pays in rent each day during the season. We can find this out by dividing his total income by the number of days he works during the season:
$$ Rent\text{ paid each day} = \frac{\text{Total income}}{ \text{Number of days worked during season}} $$
$$= \frac {472,072}{ \text{Number of days worked during season}} $$
We don't have information about the exact number of working days during the season, but we do know it's 1359 weeks. So, we can use this value to calculate the daily rent payment:
$$ Daily\text{ rent payment} = \frac {472,072}{1359} $$
$$= 350.67 $$
Therefore, Lewis pays $350.67 in rent each day during the season.";
Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week during 1181 weeks of harvest and has to pay $216 in rent each week, then his total income for the season is: $$ Total Income = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Income $$ = 1181 \times 491 $ = $573,031 $ So at the end of the season, Lewis will have: $$ Ending Balance = Total Income - Rent Paid $$ = $573,031 - $216 \* 1181 $ = $455,815 $ Therefore, Lewis will have $455,815 at the end of the season.;
"Response:  If Lewis earns $133 in total for 19 weeks of harvesting, and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he earns:

$133 / 4 = $33 per week
So, Lewis earns $33 per week.";
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per day during harvest and he earned a total of $178, then we can calculate how many days he worked as follows:

$178 = $2 x number of days worked

Now, we need to find out how much time is equivalent to $2 per day. Since Lewis works for 8 hours per day (as mentioned in the passage), we can convert his daily income to dollars per hour as follows:

$2/day = $0.50/hour (based on an 8-hour workday)

Now that we know that Lewis works for $0.50 per hour, we can divide the total amount he earned ($178) by this hourly wage to determine how many hours he worked:

$178 / $0.50/hour = 356 hours (worked during the harvest season)";
Response:  If Dean is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than he is (i.e., 10 x 9 = 90 feet), then how much higher is the water level above his head?  Therefore, if they are standing in water that is 90 feet deep, for every foot Dean is above the water line, the water is 9 feet deeper below him. So if Dean is 9 feet tall, the water is 81 feet (9 - 9) deeper below him.;
"Response:  We know that Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron, so Dean is at a height of 2 meters less than Ron's height. Since we are given that Ron is 14 feet tall (which is equal to 4.3 meters), we can set up the equation:
Dean = Ron - 2
Substituting this into the problem statement, we get:
Dubina vode = Ron - 2 + Dean
= 14 + (-2)
= 16
Therefore, the depth of the water is 16 meters.";
"Response:  We know that:
Dean is 3 meters (or 9 feet) shorter than Ron. So, if Ron is at a depth of x meters, then Dean will be at a depth of x - 3 meters.
The water is five times deeper than Ron's height. So, for every meter that Ron is tall, the water is five meters deep. Therefore, if Ron is at a depth of x meters, then the water is at a depth of 5x meters.
We are told that the water is ""peto puta"" deeper than Ron's height, which means it is five times deeper. So, we can write:
x = 5(Ron's height)
Now we have two equations: one from the fact that Dean is shorter than Ron, and another from the fact that the water is five times deeper than Ron's height. Can you use these two equations to find out how deep the water is?";
"Response:  We know that Dean is 1.80 meters taller than Ron and that the depth of water is 15 times greater than Dean's height. So we can write:

Deep = 15 x (1.80) = 270 meters

So the deepest point in the ocean where they are swimming is 270 meters below sea level.";
"Response:  We know that:

* The depth of water is 16 times greater than Ron's height.
* Dean is 2 meters taller than Ron.

So we can write:

Depth = 16 x (Ron's height)
= 16 x (2 + Ron's height)

Now we need to find out how tall Ron is. From the problem statement, we know that Ron is 5 meters above sea level. So his height is:

Ron's height = 5 meters

Substituting this value into the equation for depth, we get:

Depth = 16 x (5 meters)
= 80 meters

Therefore, the depth of the water was 80 meters.";
Response:  We know that Dean is 6 feet tall and Ron is 15 feet tall. So, if they are both in the water at the same depth of 9 times Dean's height, then we can say that Dean is underwater to a depth of 9 x 6 = 54 feet.;
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to divide them equally into two piles, each pile will have 34/2 = 17 books.;
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each book is divided into two parts (policies), then we can calculate how many policies he has as follows:

42 books / 2 parts per book = 21 policies
Therefore, Brian has 21 policies.";
Response:  If he has 27 books and each book is in 23 police boxes, then he has 27 x 23 = 619 books in total. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines and each magazine is in 23 police boxes, then he has 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines in total. Therefore, the total number of books and magazines that Brian has is 619 + 1840 = 2459.;
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book is in one of his 10 folders, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 folders in total. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine is in one of his 10 folders, then he has 46 x 10 = 460 magazines in total. So, Brian has a total of 90 + 460 = 550 publications.;
"Response:  If Brian has 23 books and each of his 29 police officers has an average of 61 magazines, then we can calculate how many books and magazines Brian has in total as follows:

Books: 23 x 29 = 707 books (not including Brian himself)
Magazines: 23 x 29 = 707 magazines (including both Brian and his police officers)
Therefore, Brian has 707 books and 707 magazines in total.";
Response:  If Brian has 7 police stations with an equal number of books in each station, then he must have 7 x 28 = 196 books in total. So, he has 196/7 = 28 books in each police station.;
Response:  If Brian has looked at and his books contain two books each, then he must have looked at 2 x 38 = 76 books in total. Therefore, there are 76 polica (or boxes) containing Brian's books.;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 10 friends for her birthday party and each invitation has 2 invitees in it, then she needs to send out 2 x 10 = 20 invitations in total. So, there will be no friend left out if she sends out exactly 20 invitations.;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 12 friends and bought 3 packs of the same number of invitations, then we can say that each pack contains 12 / 3 = 4 invitations. So, there are 4 invitations in each pack.;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to her friends and each package of invitations she bought contained 10 invitations, then the total number of invitations she had was 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she only sent invitations to 2 friends, there will be 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over. Therefore, the correct answer is 68.;
Response:  If each package contains 14 invitations and she bought 6 packages, then she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, if she also bought 11 more invitations, that brings the total number of invitations to 84 + 11 = 95. Therefore, she can potentially invite 95 friends.;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to her friends through packages and each package contained three invitations, then she bought two packages. So, in total, she has 2 x 3 = 6 invitations. To invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 9 - 6 = 3 more packages. Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game, then she scored a total of 12 x 3 = 36 points in all three games combined. Therefore, the number of games played is 36 / 12 = 3.;
Response:  If Melissa has played 3 games and won each game with 81 points, then she must have scored in total:  Number of games = 3  Total number of points = Points per game x Games played  Total points = 81 x 3 = 243 points So, Melissa has scored 243 points in all three games combined.;
Response:  If Melissa has scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points per game, then she must have scored a total of 191 points (109 x 79 = 191) in all 79 games combined.;
"Response:  If Melissa has received 21 points in several games and scored 7 points in each game, we can write an equation based on this information:

Points = Number of Games x Points per Game

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Points = 21 / Number of Games x 7

Now, we need to find out how many games Melissa played. We are told that she scored 7 points in each game, so if she played n games, her total score would be:

Total Score = Number of Games x Points per Game x Total Points
= n x 7 x 21

Therefore, the answer is:

Melissa played 3 games (i.e., 21 / 7 = 3).";
"Response:  If Melissa has scored 91 points in 13 games and she scores the same number of points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: Points = Constant x Number of Games Where ""Constant"" represents the average number of points that Melissa scores per game. To find out what the constant value is, we need to divide the total number of points (91) by the number of games played (13): Points = 91 / 13 = 7 Pts/Game Now we know that Melissa scores 7 points per game on average.";
Response:  If Krug has 4 seats and 20 people can drive at the same time, then each seat can hold how many people?  Therefore, the answer is 5.;
Response:  If Krug has seats for 9 people and there are 18 people who can drive at the same time as many seats as the parking lot has, then we need to find out how many times 9 goes into 18.  So, we divide 18 by 9: 18 / 9 = 2. Therefore, each person can drive two cars at the same time.;
Response:  We know that each vrtuljak in Paradise Park has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, we have a total of 19 x 15 = 285 seats available for passengers in all 20 helicopters combined. Since there are 20 helicopters, we need to divide the total number of seats by 20 to find out how many passengers each helicopter can carry:  Number of passengers per helicopter = Total number of seats / Number of helicopters = 285 seats / 20 helicopters = 14.25 passengers per helicopter So, the maximum number of passengers who can ride in 20 helicopters at the same time is 14.25 x 20 = 285 passengers.;
"Response:  We know that the helicopter in Raj Park has 18 seats and can accommodate 15 people at a time. So, if we divide 18 by 15, we get 
$$ \frac{18}{15} = 3 $$
Therefore, the helicopter can carry $3$ people at a time.";
Response:  If there are already 16 people at Point K in Paradise and each seat can accommodate 14 people, then we have reached the maximum capacity of that point. Therefore, no more people can be added to that point.;
Response:  We know that there are 2 small benches and 23 large benches in the park. Each small bench can accommodate 14 people, while each large bench can accommodate 54 people. So, if we want to calculate how many people can fit on the small benches, we need to divide the total number of people who can sit on all the benches by the number of small benches. In this case, that would be: Total capacity = Number of small benches x Capacity per small bench = 2 x 14 = 28 people Therefore, at most 28 people can fit on the small benches in the park.;
"Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in the park. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, so we have:

Number of people who can sit on small seats = Number of small seats x Capacity per seat = 3 x 16 = 48 people
We also know that each large seat can accommodate 12 people, so we have:

Number of people who can sit on large seats = Number of large seats x Capacity per seat = 7 x 12 = 84 people
Now, let's calculate the total number of people who can fit in the vrtuljak:
Total number of people who can fit in the helicopter = Number of people who can sit on small seats + Number of people who can sit on large seats = 48 + 84 = 132 people
Therefore, the answer is 132 people.";
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride in a helicopter at the same time and the helicopter has 4 seats, then each seat can hold how many people? We need to divide 16 by 4 to find out. So, the answer is 4 people per seat.;
Response:  If 4 people can fit in a helicopter at the park simultaneously, and each seat on the helicopter has space for two people, then we have to divide 4 by 2 to find out how many seats there are on the helicopter. So, there are 2 seats per person or 8 seats total (4 divided by 2). Therefore, there are 8 seats available on the helicopter.;
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then the total number of slices is 7 x NumberOfSlicesInOnePizza = 7 x 8 = 56 slices. So, there are 56 slices in total.;
Response:  If we ordered 28 pieces of pizza and each piece has two slices, then...;
Response:  We have 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, we need to divide 17 by 4 to find out how many groups of 4 slices we have: 17 / 4 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 groups of 4 slices in total.;
Response:  We have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If we divide them equally between two people, then each person will get 9/2 = 4.5 slices of pizza. Since you can't have half a slice of pizza, the final answer is 4 slices per person.;
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and together they sowed seeds in each flowerbed, then we know that they sowed 10 seeds in each flowerbed. So, if there are 45 flower beds, then they have collectively sowed 45 x 10 = 450 seeds. Therefore, they have sowed 450 seeds altogether.;
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and there are 9 flower beds, then each flower bed contains how many seeds?  We can divide the total number of seeds by the number of flower beds to find out:  Number of seeds per flower bed = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds  Number of seeds per flower bed = 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per flower bed.;
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 36 seeds and they together sowed 12 seeds in each flower bed. This means they sowed a total of 36 x 12 = 432 seeds. Since only 58 seeds germinated, we can calculate the number of flower beds as follows: Number of flower beds = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds that germinated Number of flower beds = 432 / 58 = 7.5 So, there were 7.5 flower beds.;
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 55 seeds and they together sowed 15 seeds in each flower bed. This means they sowed a total of 55 x 15 = 825 seeds. Now, we are told that only 60 seeds germinated into flowers in each flower bed. So, the number of flowers that grew is 825 - 60 = 765. Therefore, there were 765 flowers that grew.;
Response:  If they planted 10 seeds in each of 6 flower beds, then they have planted a total of 6 x 10 = 60 seeds. So, they had 60 flower beds.;
Response:  If they planted 32 seeds in total and there are 8 flower beds, then they planted 4 seeds per bed (32 / 8 = 4).;
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 creamers, then he had 2 x 11 = 22 creamers in total. So, Matthew had 22 creamers.;
Response:  If Matthew had 8 creepers and gave 2 to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 16 creepers (2 x 8 = 16). So, Matthew has 16 friends.;
"Response:  If Matthew had 15 creamers and gave them to his five friends, then he would have given each friend:

Matthew gave out 15 creamers / 5 friends = 3 creamers per friend
So now there are 3 creamers left over from what Matthew originally had (15 - 3 = 12).";
Response:  If Matthew had 24 creepers and gave some to his friends, then he has fewer creepers left. Let's say he gave 6 creepers to each of his 3 friends, so he has 24 - (6 x 3) = 24 - 18 = 6 creepers left. Therefore, Matthew has 6 creepers left.;
"Response:  If Matthew had 22 creepers and gave equal numbers of them to his 11 friends, then each friend would have received:

Number of creepers per friend = Total number of creepers / Number of friends
= 22 / 11
= 2 creepers per friend

So, each friend received 2 creepers from Matthew.";
Response:  If Matthew had 30 cookies and gave an equal number to his friends, then he must have given 30/x cookies to each of them, where x is the number of his friends. Since he had 29 creamers, that means he had 29 + 30 = 59 total treats to give away. So, if he gave an equal number to his friends, then he gave 59/x cookies to each of them.;
"Response:  If Matthew had 14 creepers and 21 cookies to share among his 7 friends, we can start by dividing these quantities equally among all 7 friends. So each friend will get:

Creepers: 14 / 7 = 2 creepers per friend
Cookies: 21 / 7 = 3 cookies per friend
Therefore, each of Matthew's 7 friends will receive 2 creepers and 3 cookies in total.";
"Response:  If Matthew has 36 creamers and he wants to share them equally among his 18 friends, each friend will get:

$$ \text{Number of creamers per friend} = \frac{\text{Total number of creamers}}{ \text{Number of friends}} $$

So, the number of creamers per friend is:

$$ \boxed{36 / 18 = 2} $$

Therefore, each friend will get 2 creamers.";
Response:  If Matthew gave away 6 creepers to each of his friends, and he had 36 creepers in total, then he must have had 36 / 6 = 6 friends. Therefore, Matthew got 6 friends Kreker.;
Response:  If Matthew had 23 creepers and gave equal numbers to his friends, then he must have given 23/x creepers to each friend x times. Since there are 11 remaining creepers after giving them away, we can set up the equation: 23 = (x \* 23)/11. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So, Matthew gave 4 creepers to each of his 4 friends.;
"Response:  If Matthew had 31 creepers and gave 23 to his five friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of creepers (since they are all friends). So, the number of creepers that Matthew gave to each friend is:

Number of creepers given to each friend = Total number of creepers given away / Number of friends
= 23 / 5
= 4.6
Therefore, Matthew gave 4.6 creepers to each of his five friends.";
"Response:  If Matthew has 32 creamers and 98 cookies to share among his 4 friends, we can start by dividing the total number of sweets equally among all his friends. So, each friend will get:

Total number of sweets = 32 creamers + 98 cookies = 130
Number of sweets per friend = Total number of sweets / Number of friends = 130 / 4 = 32.5
So, each friend will get approximately 32.5 sweets (creamers or cookies).";
"Response:  If Matthew had 10 creepers and 8 cookies to share among his 4 friends, then each friend would get:

10 / 4 = 2.5 creepers per person (rounded down to 2 creepers per person)
8 / 4 = 2 cookies per person (no rounding needed)
So, each person would have eaten 2 cookies.";
"Response:  If Matthew had 13 creamers and 15 cookies to share among his 28 friends, each friend would get:

Creemers: 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 4-5 creamers per person)
Cookies: 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 5-6 cookies per person)
So, approximately 4-5 creamers and 5-6 cookies were consumed by each of Matthew's 28 friends.";
"Response:  If she bought 109 bottles of water at a discount and consumed them within 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she consumed per day as follows:

$$ \text{Number of bottles consumed per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of bottles consumed}}{\text{Duration of consumption in days}} $$

In this case, the total number of bottles consumed is $109$, and the duration of consumption is $74$ days. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bottles consumed per day} = \frac{109}{74}} = 1.46 \text{ bottles per day} $$
Therefore, Debbie consumed approximately $1.46$ bottles of water per day during the period when the water was on sale.";
"Response:  If Debbie bought 153 liters of water when it was on sale and she drank the same number of liters each day, then we can find out how many days it lasted her to drink that much water. So, let x be the number of days Debbie drank 153 liters of water. We know from the problem that she drank the same amount each day, so the rate at which she drank the water is constant. Therefore, we can use the formula: Total amount = Rate x Time Where ""Total amount"" is the total number of liters Debbie drank, ""Rate"" is the number of liters she drank per day (which is also equal to the number of liters she drank each day), and ""Time"" is the number of days she drank the water. Substituting the values given in the problem into this formula, we get: Total amount = Rate x Time 153 = x(17) Now, we need to solve for ""x"", the number of days Debbie drank the water. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 17: x = 153 / 17  x = 9 So, Debbie drank 153 liters of water over 9 days.";
"Response:  If she bought 264 liters of water when it was on sale and consumed 15 liters per day for 11 days, we can calculate how much water is left as follows:

Total amount of water purchased = 264 liters
Number of days she consumed water = 11 days
Amount of water consumed each day = 15 liters

Now let's find out how much water is left:

Water left = Total amount of water purchased - (Number of days x Amount of water consumed each day)
= 264 liters - (11 x 15 liters)
= 264 liters - 165 liters
= 99 liters

So, there are 99 liters of water left.";
"Response:  If she bought 301 bottles of water at a discount and consumed 144 bottles per day for several days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows:

Day 1: She consumes 144 bottles, so she has 301 - 144 = 157 bottles left.

Day 2: She consumes another 144 bottles, so she has 157 - 144 = 13 bottles left.

And so on...

Therefore, if she consumed 144 bottles per day for several days, she would have 13 bottles left.";
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were on sale, that means she has a total of 101 bottles (88 + 13 = 101).  Now, if she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of carbonated water per day, it will last her for days. So, the number of days the water will last is:  Days = Number of bottles / Daily consumption  Days = 101 / 4 = 25.25 days  Therefore, the water will last Debbie approximately 25.25 days.;
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 cans of soda when they were on sale, that means she has a total of 456 drinks (200 + 256 = 456).  If she consumes 312 bottles of water and 4 cans of gasoline-water mix per day, it will take her approximately days to finish them all. So, the answer is days.;
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she bought 12 bottles of water, then we can calculate how much she spent on water for one day as follows: Number of bottles = Daily consumption x Total amount purchased Daily cost = Total amount purchased / Number of bottles So, in this case, the daily cost would be: $12 (Total amount purchased) / 6 (Number of bottles per day) = $2 per day Now, if you want to know how much she spends on water for one week, you can multiply the daily cost by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): $2 per day x 7 days/week = $14 per week And finally, if you want to know how much she spends on water for one month, you can multiply the weekly cost by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month): $14 per week x 4 weeks/month = $56 per month;
"Response:  If Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she paid $ for those bottles.  If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of sparkling water per day, how many days will it last her?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day:  Total bottles = Number of bottles she has Drinking bottles per day  In this case, Debbie has a total of bottles (95 + 180) and drinks bottles per day (15 + 54). So, if she continues to drink at that rate, it will take her approximately days to finish all of the bottles she has:  Days = Total bottles / Drinking bottles per day  Substituting the values we know into the equation above, we get:  Days = (95 + 180) / (15 + 54)  Simplifying and solving for ""Days"", we get:  Days = (275) / (69)  Days = Approximately days It will take Debbie to finish all of the bottles she has if she continues to drink at that rate.";
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she has a total of 522 bottles (360 + 162).  If she drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of sparkling water per day, it means that she will finish all her water in 14 days (122 / 9 = 13.5 days). Since she also drank some sparkling water, let's assume that she finished those as well in the same amount of time (13.5 days). Therefore, the gasoline-powered water lasted for 13.5 days.;
"Response:  If Faye has placed 11 olive branches in each of the 14 rows, then she has a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of olive branches} = 11 \times 14 = 154 $$

Therefore, there are 154 olive branches in total.";
Response:  If Faye has placed 12 oak leaves in total and she has divided them into 3 rows, then each row must contain an equal number of oak leaves. Therefore, we can conclude that: Row 1 contains 4 oak leaves (since 12 / 3 = 4). Row 2 contains 4 oak leaves as well (again, 12 / 3 = 4). And Row 3 also contains 4 oak leaves (yet again, 12 / 3 = 4). So, to summarize: Row 1 has 4 oak leaves, Row 2 has 4 oak leaves, and Row 3 has 4 oak leaves as well.;
Response:  If Faye has 28 packets of pencils and each packet contains 24 pencils, then she has in total 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Since she can make 16 rows with 16 pencils in each row, she can make 16 x 16 = 256 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 256 rows of pencils.;
"Response:  We know that Faye has 6 packs of pencils and each pack contains 14 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

6 packs x 14 pencils/pack = 84 pencils
So, there are 84 pencils in total.";
Response:  If Faye has 35 olovaka and wants to make as many rows as possible with 5 olovaka in each row, she can do at most 35/5 = 7 rows.  Therefore, she can make 7 rows.;
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils and paints in 19 rows with 4 pencils and 27 paints in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 19 x 4 = 76 pencils So, there are 76 pencils in total.;
"Response:  If she had 7 rows with 36 olive branches in each row and 30 colors in each row, then the total number of olive branches would be:

7 rows x 36 olive branches per row = 252 olive branches
And if there were 30 colors in each row, then the total number of colors would be:

7 rows x 30 colors per row = 210 colors
So, Faye had a total of 252 olive branches and 210 colors.";
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 olive in her first row and 27 colors in each of the remaining rows. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of olives as follows: Total number of olives = Number of rows x Number of olive per row = 11 x 31 = 341 olives In addition, we know that there are 27 colors in each of the remaining rows, so the total number of colors is: Total number of colors = Number of rows x Number of colors per row = 11 x 27 = 297 colors Therefore, the final answer to the question is: There are 341 olives and 297 colors in Faye's box.;
Response:  If she has built 30 ovens and each oven contains 5 eggs, then the total number of eggs is 30 x 5 = 150 eggs. Therefore, Faye can make 150 rows.;
Response:  If Faye has 6 olovaka in total and she wants to divide them into two equal parts, then each part will have 3 olovaka (since 2 x 3 = 6). So, Faye has put 3 olovaka in each of the two rows.;
Response:  If Faye had 35 packets of chopsticks and each packet contained 4 chopsticks, then she would have total of 35 x 4 = 140 chopsticks. Since she was placing them in rows with two chopsticks in each row, she could make a total of 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, there will be 70 rows of chopsticks.;
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packs of pencils and each pack contained 6 pencils. So, in total, she had 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Now, we are asked how many rows of pencils Faye had. Since each row contains 19 pencils, Faye must have had 186 / 19 = 9 rows of pencils. Therefore, there are 9 rows of pencils in total.;
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils and paints in 30 rows with 71 pencils and 24 pencils in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 30 x 71 = 2130 pencils So, there are 2130 pencils in total.;
"Response:  If she had 6 colors and 21 brushes in each row, then she had:

6 x 21 = 126 brushes in total

So, Faye had 126 brushes.";
Response:  Number of students in school = 98  Number of classrooms (not including gym or other rooms) = 21 Since each classroom can hold at most 30 students, we have: Total capacity for all classes = 21 x 30 = 630 Students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 630 / 7 = 90 So there are approximately 90 students per bus.;
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each classroom can accommodate 30 students (as assumed). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:

Number of classrooms = 84
Capacity of each classroom = 30 students
Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity of each classroom
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
So, there are approximately 2520 students in the school.";
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in total and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4232 students. Since each student needs to be transported in a school bus, we need at least one school bus for every 4232/6 = 705 students. So, we need 7 school buses to transport all the students on the field trip.;
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students in total. Since each group has the same number of students, we can assume that there will be 1 student per classroom. Therefore, the number of groups is equal to the number of classrooms divided by the number of students per group:

Number of groups = Number of classrooms / Number of students per group
= 87 / 1
= 87

Since each group needs two buses, the total number of buses needed is twice the number of groups:

Total number of buses = Number of groups x 2
= 87 x 2
= 174

Therefore, the school needs 174 buses for the planned excursion.";
Response:  We know that there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. So, we can assume that there are 120/number of classes = x students in each class. Since there are 3 classes, then x = 120 / 3 = 40 students per class. Therefore, there are 40 students in each class.;
Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms in the school and 102 students attending it. If 22 students do not want to go on the trip, then we need to find out how many students will be left behind. So, let x = 22 (the number of students who don't want to go). Now, we have: Number of students going on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go = 102 - x = 80 Since there are 8 seats available per bus, we can divide the total number of students going on the trip by 8 to find out how many buses are needed: Number of buses required = Total number of students going on the trip / Number of seats per bus = 80 / 8 = 10 buses Therefore, there should be 10 buses for the trip.;
"Response:  If there are 102 classrooms and 11 students who do not want to go on the trip, then the number of students going on the trip is:

$$ \text {Number of students going on the trip} = 102 - 11 = 91 $$

So, 91 students will be going on the trip.";
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 3 seats per bus. So we have:

Number of classrooms = 72
Number of seats per bus = 3
Total number of seats available for the trip = Number of classrooms x Number of seats per bus
= 72 x 3
= 216
Now, we need to find out how many buses will be needed for the trip. Since there are 111 students in total, we can divide the total number of seats available by the number of students to get the number of buses required:

Number of buses required = Total number of seats available / Number of students
= 216 / 111
= 19
Therefore, the school needs 19 buses for the trip.";
Response:  If there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total, then each bus can carry at most 92/46 = 2 students. Since there are 17 classrooms, we need to divide the number of students by the number of classrooms to find out how many students go on each trip: Number of students per trip = Total number of students / Number of classrooms = 92 / 17 = 5.3 Students per trip. Therefore, if all buses are full, there will be 46 x 5.3 = 240 students going on the field trip.;
Response:  If Hayley has 9 balls and wants to distribute them equally among 11 boys, each boy will get how many balls?  To find out, we can divide 9 by 11: 9 / 11 = 0.818 (or approximately 8 balls per boy). So, each of the 11 boys will receive about 8 balls from Hayley.;
Response:  If Hayley has 10 marbles and gives each boy 5 marbles, then she will give out a total of 5 x 5 = 25 marbles. So there are 25 marbles in total.;
Response:  If there are 4 boys in the fourth grade and they like playing marbles, then each boy will get an equal number of marbles. So, if Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for himself, then each boy will get 7 marbles (23 / 4 = 7).;
Response:  If there are 13 boys who want to play marbles and each of them gets 4 marbles, then they will get together 52 marbles (since there are 13 x 4 = 52 marbles in total). Now, if there are 50 boys who want to play cards and each of them gets 3 cards, then they will get together 150 cards (since there are 50 x 3 = 150 cards in total). So, the total number of marbles that all the boys will get is 52 + 150 = 202 marbles.;
Response:  If there are 20 marbles in total and there are 5 boys in the class who like to play marbles, then each boy will get 4 marbles (20 / 5 = 4).;
Response:  If there are 28 kuglica and Haley gives each child two kuglice, then the number of children is:  Number of children = Total number of kuglice / Number of kuglice given to each child  Number of children = 28 / 2  Number of children = 14;
"Response:  If Frank reads 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank will need 27 days to finish reading his favorite book if he continues to read at a rate of 14 pages per day.";
Response:  If Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book, then we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Number of pages = Total pages / Days taken to finish the book So, in this case, the number of pages in the book is: Number of pages = 304 pages (based on the assumption that each page has 22 lines) Therefore, there are 304 pages in the book.;
Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish his book with 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. So, he read at most $ \frac{612}{6} = 102$ pages per day.;
"Response:  If Frank has been reading his favorite book for 220 days and it has 555 pages divided into 5 chapters, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 pages / 5 chapters
= 111 pages per chapter

Therefore, there are 111 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.";
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 660 days and it had 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of days by the number of chapters: 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter. So, Frank read one chapter every 44 days.;
Response:  If Frank read each book in 3 days and each book has 249 pages, then he reads at a rate of pages per day. So, if he reads one book in 3 days, he reads pages per day. Therefore, Frank read pages daily.;
"Response:  If Frank read x books and each book had y pages, then he spent z days reading, where:
x = number of books read
y = number of pages in each book
z = total number of days spent reading
We are given that Frank read 66 pages per book and it took him 12 days to finish one book, so we can calculate the time taken to read each page as follows:
Time taken to read one page = Number of days taken to finish one book / Number of pages in each book
= 12 days / 66 pages
= 0.185 days (or 18.5 hours) per page
Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read in total:
Total number of pages read = Number of books read x Total number of pages in each book
= x x 66 pages
So, if Frank read x books, he read a total of x x 66 pages = x y pages.
Finally, we need to find out how many days it would take Frank to read all the books:
Total number of days taken to read all the books = Total number of pages read / Time taken to read one page
= x y pages / 0.185 days per page
= x y days
Therefore, the answer is:
Frank will take approximately x y days to read all the books he has read, where x is the number of books he read and y is the number of pages in each book.";
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book and the book had 112 pages, then he read an average of pages per day. So, we can write this equation:
pages/day = days taken / number of pages in the book
Now, let's plug in the values given in the question:
pages/day = 16 / 112
pages/day = 0.14 or approximately 14 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 14 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days.";
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total, it will take him:

Time = Total pages / Daily reading pages
= 576 / 8
= 72 days

Therefore, Frank will finish reading his favorite book in 72 days if he continues to read at the same pace of 8 pages per day.";
"Response:  If Frank has read his favorite book for 30 days and each chapter has 450 pages, then he must have read:

Total number of chapters = Number of days x Number of chapters per day
= 30 x 41
= 1230 chapters

Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank reads every day. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages in the book (41 x 450) by the number of chapters he reads per day:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of chapters per day
= 41 x 450 / 1230
= 367.5 pages/day

Therefore, Frank reads approximately 367.5 pages every day.";
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 607 days and each chapter has 594 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 594 pages x 3 chapters = 1782 pages Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter: Pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 1782 pages / 3 chapters = 594 pages per chapter Therefore, there are 594 pages in each chapter.;
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 664 days and each chapter had 2 parts with 405 pages each. So, he read 2 x 405 = 810 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 810 pages/day.;
Response:  If we divide $120 by 6, we get $20 per package. So, each pack of 6 DVD-As costs $20.;
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then the cost of 33 packages would be:
$81 x 33 = $2690.";
"Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 on each package, then we can calculate how many packages we can buy with $93 as follows:

$93 / $106 = x

x = 9

So, we can buy 9 packages of DVDs with $93.";
Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then we need to find out how much we will pay for each package after applying the discount. So, the cost of each package = $76 - ($25 x number of packages) = $76 - (25 x n), where n is the number of packages we are buying. Now, we can solve for n by rearranging the equation as follows: n = (cost of each package / discount amount) = ( $76 - (25 x n)) / $25 = (100 - (25 x n)) / $25. Solving for n, we get n = 4. Therefore, you will have to pay $76 - ($25 x 4) = $39 per package.;
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend and each package costs $26, then you can buy:
$104 / $26 = 4 packages
So, you can buy 4 packages of DVDs.";
Response:  If we buy 2 packs of DVDs for $28, then each pack must cost half of that amount or $14 per pack.;
Response:  We have 18 bananas in total. If we divide them into groups of size 2, then we can make 9 groups (18 / 2 = 9). So there are 9 groups of bananas.;
Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas in Filip's collection and each group contains 187 bananas. So, we can calculate the total number of bananas as follows: Total number of bananas = Number of groups x Number of bananas per group Total number of bananas = 140 x 187 = 23,800 bananas Therefore, there are 23,800 bananas in Filip's collection.;
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and they are organized into 7 groups. So, the number of bananas in each group is:

Number of bananas per group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 203 / 7 = 29

Therefore, each group contains 29 bananas.";
Response:  We know that there are 356 naranča in total. If they are organized into groups of 178, then each group must contain at least 2 naranča (since we can't have a group with fewer than 2 naranča). Therefore, the number of groups of naranča is equal to 356 / 178 = 2. So, each group of naranča contains 2 naranča.;
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's collection and each group contains an unknown number of bananas. Therefore, we can write the equation: Number of bananas = Total number of bananes / Number of groups. In this case, the total number of bananas is given as 392, so we can plug it into the equation to get: Number of bananas = 392 / 196 = 2 So, each group contains 2 bananas.;
"Response:  If there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 18, then we can find out how many groups there are as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group
= 180 / 18
= 10

So, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection.";
Response:  We know that there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in total. If we divide the number of bananas into groups of 2, then each group will have 290/2 = 145 bananas. Now, if we divide the number of oranges into groups of 93, then each group will have 87/93 = 9 oranges. Therefore, the size of each group of bananas is 145, and the size of each group of oranges is 9.;
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in total.  Of those, 16 oranges are organized into groups, and 345 bananas are organized into groups. So, to find out how many bananas are in each group of oranges, we can divide the number of bananas by the number of groups of oranges: $ \frac {192}{16} = 12$ bananas are in each group of oranges. Therefore, each group of oranges has 12 bananas.;
Response:  If Brenda made 38 kolačiće for guests and each of them has 19 kolači for how many guests she prepared kolače?  We know that Brenda prepared 38 kolačiće in total, so if we divide it by the number of kolači (19) per guest, we get:  Number of guests = Total number of kolačiće / Number of kolači per guest  Number of guests = 38 / 19  Number of guests = 2 So, Brenda prepared kolače for 2 guests.;
"Response:  If Brenda made 14 kolačića and each of them had 30 kolačića, then we can calculate how many total kolačića Brenda prepared as follows:

Total number of kolačića = Number of kolačića per colačić x Total number of kolačića per colačić
= 30 x 14
= 420

Therefore, Brenda prepared 420 kolačića in total.";
Response:  If Brenda made 22 cookies and had to throw away 17 of them, that means she has 5 remaining cookies. Now, let's assume each cookie has an equal number of chocolate chips. So, if there are 5 cookies in total, then each cookie must have 5/5 = 1 chocolate chip. Therefore, the answer is 1.;
Response:  If Brenda made 18 cookies and 9 guests did not come, then she had 9 x 2 = 18 cookies left for the remaining 10 guests. So each of these 10 guests received 18/10 = 1.8 cookies per person.;
Response:  If Brenda made 14 cookies for 2 guests and each cookie had the same number of raisins as there were guests, then...  So, if Brenda made 14 cookies for 2 guests, that means she made 7 cookies for one guest (since 14 / 2 = 7). And since each cookie had the same number of raisins as there were guests, each cookie for one guest would have 7 raisins. Therefore, the answer is 7.;
Response:  If Brenda made 10 kolačić for guests and each guest had 2 kolačić, then...  Number of kolačić prepared by Brenda = 10  Number of guests = 2 (since each guest had 2 kolačić) Total number of kolačić consumed = Number of kolačić prepared x Number of guests  Total number of kolačić consumed = 10 x 2 = 20 So, Brenda prepared 20 kolačić for her guests.;
Response:  If Frank had 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them equally among two boxes, then each box will contain how many pieces of candy?  We can solve this problem using division.  The number of pieces of candy in one box is equal to the total number of pieces of candy divided by 2. So, if Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them equally among two boxes, then each box will contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If Frank had some pieces of candy and put them in 26 boxes with 33 pieces of candy in each box, then we can calculate how many pieces of candy he had as follows: Number of pieces of candy = Total number of pieces of candy / Number of boxes x Number of pieces of candy per box So, if Frank had X pieces of candy and put them in Y boxes, then the total number of pieces of candy is X/Y x 33, where X is the initial number of pieces of candy and Y is the number of boxes. Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: X = 10 (since Frank had 10 pieces of candy) Y = 26 (since there were 26 boxes) Substituting these values into the formula above, we get: Number of pieces of candy = 10/26 x 33 = 390 pieces of candy Therefore, Frank had 390 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24, then he has 9 remaining (33 - 24 = 9). Now we need to divide these 9 pieces among 5 containers (vessels or boxes), each container can hold 9/5 = 1.8 pieces of candy. So there will be 1 container with 1 piece of candy, 2 containers with 2 pieces of candy each, 3 containers with 3 pieces of candy each, and 1 container with 4 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If Frank has put 11 comadas of bombons in each basket, then he will have 11 x 22 = 242 bombons in total. So, one basket will have 24 bombons.;
Response:  If Frank has put 16 pieces of chewing gum in two boxes, then he must have put 8 pieces of chewing gum in each box. So, there are 8 pieces of chewing gum in each box.;
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 boxes of trefoils and each box contains 14 pieces, then we need to find out how many pieces of trefoils Shirley needs to deliver in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of boxes she sold with the number of pieces in each box:  Number of pieces = Total number of boxes x Number of pieces per box  Number of pieces = 25 x 14  Number of pieces = 350 pieces So, Shirley needs to deliver 350 pieces of trefoils in total.;
Response:  If Shirley has sold 10 boxes of trefoils and each box contains 3 kits, then she has in total 10 x 3 = 30 kits. To deliver 5 kits, she will have to take out 5/30 = 2 kits from her inventory. Therefore, there are 2 kits left in her inventory after delivery 5 kits.;
Response:  We know that there were 67 people who had ordinary gruel and 9 people who had dietary gruel. To find out how many more flappers of ordinary gruel there were than dietary gruel, we need to subtract the number of dietary gruel from the total number of flappers consumed. So, if there were x flappers of ordinary gruel in total, then the number of flappers of dietary gruel is 9, and therefore the difference between the two is x - 9 = 58. Therefore, there were 58 more flappers of ordinary gruel than dietary gruel.;
"Response:  We know that there were 22 bottles of regular carbonated beer and 61 bottles of diet carbonated beer. To find out how many more diet sodas they had than regular sodas, we can divide the number of diet sodas by the number of regular sodas:

Number of diet sodas = 61 bottles / 22 bottles = 3
So, they had 3 more diet sodas than regular sodas.";
"Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of ordinary sparkling water and 8 bottles of dietary sparkling water. Each bottle contains 0.5 liters of liquid, so we have:

ordinary sparkling water = 30 x 0.5 = 15 liters
dietary sparkling water = 8 x 0.5 = 4 liters

Now let's calculate the total amount of liquid in all the drinks:

total liquid = ordinary sparkling water + dietary sparkling water + apples
= 15 liters + 4 liters + 41 jabuk (jabuk means ""apples"" in Croatian)
= 23 liters

So, the total number of flacons they had was:

flacons = total liquid / volume of each flacon
= 23 liters / 0.5 liter per flacon
= 46 flacons

Therefore, the answer is 46 flacons.";
"Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of ordinary beer and 53 bottles of diet beer in total. Therefore, we can calculate how many more bottles of ordinary beer than diet beer are as follows:

Number of ordinary beer bottles - Number of diet beer bottles = 79 - 53 = 26

So, there were 26 more bottles of ordinary beer than diet beer. Now, let's consider the number of apples. The question states that there were 42 apples. Since we already calculated the difference between the number of ordinary and diet beers, we can now use this information to find out how many more apples there were than diet beers as follows:

Number of apples - Number of diet beers = 42 - 53 = -11

Therefore, there were 11 fewer apples than diet beers.";
"Response:  We know that there were 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda, we can subtract the number of diet bottles from the total number of bottles:

Total number of bottles = 54 + 83 = 137

So, there are 137 - 54 = 83 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.";
Response:  We know that there were 17 people in total and 9 of them were ordinary sodas while the rest were diet sodas. So, the number of ordinary sodas consumed is 9 x 8 = 72 fl oz (since each ordinary soda contains 8 fl oz). Now, we also know that there were 29 jabukas, which means that each person consumed an average of 29/17 = 1.67 jabukas. Since each jabuku contains 4 fl oz, the total amount of fluid consumed by all 17 people is 1.67 x 4 = 6.68 fl oz. Finally, since only diet sodas are left over after everyone has finished drinking, their total consumption must be equal to the remaining volume of diet soda, which is 29 - 72 = -43 fl oz. Therefore, the answer is 6.68 + (-43) = -36.68 fl oz.;
"Response:  We know that there were 19 boxes of dietary soup and 60 boxes of regular soup. To find out how many more boxes of regular soup there are than dietary soup, we can divide the number of boxes of regular soup by the number of boxes of dietary soup:

Number of boxes of regular soup = 60
Number of boxes of dietary soup = 19

So, there are 31 more boxes of regular soup than dietary soup (60 - 19 = 31).";
"Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of ordinary gasoline and 32 bottles of diesel fuel. So, in total, we have 104 bottles (72 + 32). Now, let's count how many jars of jam are mentioned in the problem: ""There were also 78 jars of jam."" Therefore, the number of jars of jam is equal to 78. Finally, we need to find out how many more jars of jam than bottles of gasoline or diesel fuel there are: Number of jars of jam = 78 Bottles of gasoline or diesel fuel = 104 Therefore, there are 26 more jars of jam than bottles of gasoline or diesel fuel.";
Response:  We know that there were 36 jabukas and 80 bocca of ordinary fermented beer. Therefore, we can calculate how many more bocca of fermented beer are in total as follows: Total number of bocca = Number of jabukas x Number of bocca per jabuka + Number of ordinary fermented beers x Number of bocca per ordinary fermented beer Total number of bocca = 36 x 80 + 80 x 54 = 1296 bocca So, there were 1296 - 80 = 1216 more bocca of fermented beer than jabukas.;
Response:  We know that there were 30 people in total and 28 of them were ordinary sodas, so we can assume that they drank 28 x 1 = 28 flappers of regular soda. As for the remaining two people, one drank diet soda, which has fewer calories than regular soda, so let's assume they drank half as much as the others, or 28 / 2 = 14 flappers of diet soda. Therefore, the total number of flappers consumed is 28 + 14 = 42 flappers.;
Response:  If there were 4 bottles of dietary drinks and they had 79 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, then we can say that the number of bottles of regular soda is equal to the number of bottles of diet soda minus 79. So, if there are x bottles of diet soda, then there are x - 79 bottles of regular soda.;
Response:  We know that there were 57 ordinary socks, 26 dietary socks, and 27 lightweight socks in total. So, we can calculate the number of flappers as follows:  Number of flappers = Total number of socks / Number of socks per flap  In this case, the number of socks per flap is not given in the question, but it is assumed to be constant for all types of socks. Therefore, we can use an average value of 30 socks per flap (which is a rough estimate based on the sizes of the three categories).  Now, let's plug in the values:  Number of flappers = 57 + 26 + 27 = 110  So, there were approximately 110 flappers in total.;
Response:  We know that there were 81 bottles of ordinary sweetened drink in total. Of those, 60 were diet and 60 were light. So, if we subtract the number of diet bottles from the total number of bottles, we get: Total number of ordinary bottles = 81 - 60 = 21. Now, let's find out how many more ordinary bottles there were than diet bottles: Number of ordinary bottles > Diet bottles = 21 > 60 = 15. Therefore, there were 15 more ordinary bottles than diet bottles.;
Response:  We know that there were 49 people in total who drank some kind of soup (obično or dijetno). Of those, 40 drank obični and 6 drank dijetno. So, if we want to find out how many flaşas of each type they consumed, we can use the following formula: Number of flaşas = Total number of people x Amount drunk per person / Amount of one flaşa To calculate this, we need to divide the total amount of each type of soup consumed by the amount of one flaşa. For obično, this is 1/2 liter, and for dijetno, it is also 1/2 liter. Now let's plug in the numbers: Number of flaşas of običnog = 49 x 1/2 L / 0.5 L = 98 flaşas Number of flaşas of dijetnog = 49 x 1/2 L / 0.5 L = 78 flaşas Therefore, there were approximately 98 flaşas of običnog soka and 78 flaşas of dijetnog soka consumed in total.;
Response:  If there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 317 visitors came that day, then the difference between the two days is: 317 - 295 = 22. So, there are 22 more visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day.;
Response:  If there were 246 visitors to Buckingham Palace on one day and they stayed for 25 days, then the total number of visitors would be:  Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days = 246/25 = 9.84 visitors per day  Therefore, in 25 days, approximately 246 x 9.84 = 2371 visitors would have visited Buckingham Palace.;
Response:  If there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day and 100 more visitors came the next day, then the total number of visitors that day is: 666 + 100 = 766 visitors. So, there are 766 more visitors than the previous day.;
Response:  If 406 people visited Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days and they are now at Buckingham Palace, then the number of visitors today is 132 - 406 = -374. So, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday was 374.;
Response:  If 829 people visited Buckingham Palace in the past 85 days and they were followed by 45 more visitors that day, then we can calculate how many total visitors there were as follows: Total number of visitors = Number of previous visitors + Number of new visitors Total number of visitors = 829 + 45 = 874 Therefore, there were 874 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the given time period.;
Response:  If there were 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that 557 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day, then we can calculate how many visitors visited per day as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days = 557 / 57 = 9.6 visitors per day Now, let's find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace in total over 57 days: Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days = 9.6 visitors/day x 57 days = 543 visitors Overall, there were 543 visitors who visited Buckingham Palace during the 57-day period.;
Response:  If there were 39 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 661 visitors came that day, then the number of visitors per painting is: Number of visitors / Number of paintings = 661/39 = 17.5 visitors per painting. Now, if there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the number of visitors that day and the previous day is: Number of visitors today - Number of visitors yesterday = 661 - 600 = 61 more visitors today than yesterday. Therefore, the answer to the question is 61 more visitors.;
Response:  If there were 419 visitors the day before and 103 visitors the day before that, then there would be a total of: 419 + 103 = 522 visitors in the two days before the day of the royal reception.  Therefore, if 92 additional visitors came on the day of the royal reception, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace that day would be: 522 + 92 = 614 visitors.;
Response:  If there were 471 visitors the day before and 808 visitors the day before that, then there would be a total of: 471 + 808 = 1279 visitors in the past 89 days.;
Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 191 visitors the previous day, then the difference between these two numbers is 514 (705 - 191). Similarly, if there were 457 visitors the day before that, then the total number of visitors over the past three days is 514 + 457 = 971. Therefore, more than 971 people visited Buckingham Palace in the past 245 days.;
"Response:  We know that there are 159 grams of glue left to be added to the feathers. So, we need to find out how much glue is needed for 628 grams of feathers. To do this, we can divide the amount of glue remaining (159 grams) by the total weight of feathers (628 grams). Therefore, the number of grams of glue needed for each gram of feathers is:

$$ \frac{159}{628} = 0.247 $$
So, if the feathers require $ x $ grams of glue, then:

$$ x = 0.247 \times 628 = 153.36 $$
Therefore, there are $ 153.36 $ grams of glue needed for each gram of feathers.";
Response:  We know that the total amount of glue needed is 49 g and we have only 260 g of glue available. So, to find out how much glue each feather will require, we can divide the total amount of glue needed by the number of feathers: 49 g / 4 = 12.25 g per feather.;
Response:  We know that we need to paint 57 grams of glue for the wings and tail together, and another 22 grams of glue for their painting. So in total, we need 57 + 22 = 79 grams of glue. Now, if the feathers require an overall amount of 353 grams of glue, how much do they already have? Therefore, the answer is 353 - 79 = 274 grams.;
Response:  If he has 20 grams of glue and the feathers require 166 grams of glue, then we need to find out how much more glue is required. So, we subtract the amount of glue he already has from the total amount of glue needed: 166 - 20 = 146 grams. Therefore, he needs an additional 146 grams of glue.;
Response:  We know that there are 557 grams of glue and we need to calculate how much glue is needed for the feathers. So, if we divide 557 grams by 17 grams (the amount of glue needed), we get 32.6 grams of glue required for each feather. Therefore, the total number of grams of glue required for all feathers would be 32.6 x Number of Feathers = Total Grams of Glue Required.;
"Response:  If there are currently 11 g of glue and it takes 492 g to cover all the feathers, then we need more glue. So, we can calculate how much more glue we need as follows:

Needed amount of glue = Total amount of feathers - Amount of glue already used
= 492 g - 11 g
= 481 g

Response:  If there are 94 farmers and they can fill 90 barrels of grapes in 6 days, that means each farmer can fill 15 barrels per day (90/94 = 15).;
Response:  If there are 266 workers and they can fill 90 barrels of grapes in 5 days, that means each worker can fill 18 barrels per day (90/266 = 18). So, if we want to know how many barrels of grapes can be filled each day, we can multiply the number of workers by the number of barrels each worker can fill per day: 18 barrels/day x 266 workers = 4732 barrels/day.;
"Response:  If we assume that each day he needs to fill 244 Sudoves of grapes and 47 Sudoves of blackberries, then in total for 146 days it would be:
Grapes: 244 x 146 = 35,084 Sudoves
Blackberries: 47 x 146 = 6,698 Sudoves
So, altogether, the barrel could hold around 41,782 Sudoves of wine.";
"Response:  If we assume that each day, 235 collectors bring 100 bunches of grapes and 221 bunches of blackberries to Kao, then in total, they will bring:

Grapes: 100 x 235 = 23,500 bunches per day
Blackberries: 221 x 235 = 52,925 bunches per day

Now, let's calculate how many bunches of grapes can be filled for 77 days:

Total number of bunches of grapes = Number of days x Total number of bunches per day
= 77 x 23,500
= 186,500 bunches

Similarly, the number of bunches of blackberries that can be filled for 77 days is:

Total number of bunches of blackberries = Number of days x Total number of bunches per day
= 77 x 52,925
= 4,057,750 bunches

Therefore, if Kao saves these fruits from his favorite vineyard every day, he will have:

* 186,500 bunches of grapes
* 4,057,750 bunches of blackberries";
Response:  If Kao's favorite farmer saved 57 harvestings of grapes and every day he filled 108 baskets with grapes, then in total he filled 57 x 108 = 6344 baskets with grapes. Now, if we assume that each basket can hold 108 bunches of grapes (as mentioned in the problem), then the total number of bunches of grapes that Kao's favorite farmer saved is 6344 x 108 = 696,720 bunches of grapes. Therefore, the answer to the question is 696,720 bunches of grapes.;
Response:  If it takes 36 workers 8 days to fill 8 barrels of grapes, then one worker will need 8/36 = 1 day to fill 1 barrel of grapes. Therefore, it will take 240 / 1 = 240 days for 36 workers to fill 240 barrels of grapes.;
Response:  If he had 26 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has the same number of fish, then we can say that there are 26 x 52 = 1372 marine animals in total. So, each aquarium contains 1372 / 26 = 52 marine animals. Therefore, each aquarium has 52 marine animals.;
"Response:  We know that there are 40 saltwater animals in different aquariums. If each aquarium has 2 animals, then we have:

40 / 2 = 20 aquariums

So, there were 20 aquariums in total.";
Response:  If Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater and 10 for freshwater animals, that means he has a total of 66 aquariums.  Since each aquarium can hold up to 39 fish or other marine animals, then Tyler has a total of 66 x 39 = 2748 marine animals in his collection!;
Response:  If Tyler has 74 freshwater aquariums and each aquarium contains 46 fish, then he has a total of 3,384 fish (74 x 46 = 3,384). Similarly, if he has 22 saltwater aquariums and each aquarium contains 46 fish, then he has a total of 952 fish (22 x 46 = 952). Therefore, Tyler has a total of 4,336 marine animals (3,384 + 952 = 4,336).;
"Response:  For saltwater aquariums, there are 15 aquariums and each has 19 fish, so we have:

15 x 19 = 285 fish for saltwater aquariums.
For freshwater aquariums, there are 62 aquariums and each has 19 fish, so we have:

62 x 19 = 1178 fish for freshwater aquariums.
In total, there are 285 + 1178 = 1463 fish in all the aquariums.";

Therefore, your mother will receive $3$ packages of white shirts.";
Response:  If Mama buys 66 white dresses in packages of 3 each, then she will buy 22 packages (66 / 3 = 22).;
"Response:  If we buy 28 packages of white shirts and each package contains 56 white shirts in total (as stated in the question), then...

1. The number of white shirts in one package is 56.
2. Therefore, the number of white shirts in 28 packages is 28 x 56 = 1492 white shirts.";
Response:  If we buy 57 packets of white shirts and each packet contains 53 pieces of white shirts, then the total number of white shirts we will get is:  Number of white shirts = Total number of packets x Number of pieces in each packet = 57 x 53 = 3011. So there will be 3011 white shirts in total if we buy 57 packets of them.;

So, you have $3$ baskets full of candy.";
Response:  Postman must send 5 unwanted letters to each block. Since there are 10 houses in each block, he will have to send 5 x 10 = 50 unwanted letters in total. Now, if he sends 25 letters to each house, he will have sent a total of 25 x 10 = 250 letters. So, the correct answer is 250.;
Response:  Postman must send 9 letters to each house in each quarter, so he needs to send 9 x 4 = 36 letters in total. Since there are 20 houses in each block, postman needs to give 36 / 20 = 1.8 letters of undeliverable mail per block. Therefore, postman needs to give 1.8 letters of undeliverable mail in each block.;
Response:  If there are 6 houses in each block and the postman needs to deliver 24 packages per block, then we need to divide 24 by 6 to find out how many packages he needs to deliver to each house. So, the answer is 4 packages per house (24 / 6 = 4).;
"Response:  If Postar gives 14 unwanted messages to each house in the block, and he has to give 2 packages of unwanted mail to each block, then the number of houses in each block is:

Number of houses per block = Number of unwanted messages / Number of packages of unwanted mail per block
= 14 / 2
= 7

So there are 7 houses in each block.";
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the postman needs to deliver 32 pieces of mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of mail that need to be delivered is:  20 x 32 = 640 pieces of mail. Therefore, the answer is 640.;
Response:  Postman must send 30 pieces of mail to each of the 78 blocks. Since there are 19 houses in each block, he needs to give 30 / 19 = 1.6 comas of undeliverable mail to each house. So, the total number of undeliverable letters that postman should give is 1.6 x 19 = 154 undeliverable letters.;
Response:  Postman must send 8 packages to each of the 55 blocks, so in total he must send 8 x 55 = 440 packages. Since there are 32 messages for each house, and there are houses in each block, we can calculate the number of messages that postman must send to each house as follows: Number of messages per house = Total number of messages / Number of houses in the block Therefore, the number of messages that postman must send to each house is: Number of messages per house = 440 / 55 = 8 messages per house.;
Response:  Postman must send 4 packages of mail to each house in 81 quarters. Since there are 12 houses in each block, he needs to give 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of undeliverable mail in each block. Therefore, the total number of undeliverable letters that postman should give is 81 x 48 = 3672.;
Response:  Postman must send 4 packages of mail to each house in each block, so he needs to send 4 x 16 = 64 packages of mail in total. Since there are 17 houses in each quarter, postman needs to send 64 / 17 = 3.82 packages of mail that are not valid (round up to 4). Therefore, postman needs to give 4 invalid packages of mail to each quarter.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles. If she wants to divide them into groups of 4, we need to find out how many groups she can make. To do this, we can use division. Division is when you divide one number by another to get a group or portion of something. In this case, we are dividing 20 (the total number of marbles) by 4 (the number of marbles in each group). So, if we divide 20 by 4, we get 5. This means that Rebecca can make 5 groups of 4 marbles each using all of her marbles. Therefore, the answer is 5.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs to share among groups of 5 people each. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide the total number of objects (marbles + eggs) by 5. So, we will divide 10 + 15 = 25 by 5: 25 / 5 = 5 groups. Therefore, Rebecca can create 5 groups with her collection of marbles and eggs.;
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide her collection of eggs into groups of 11, then she will have 11 groups in total. Since each group has 2 eggs, Rebecca will have a total of 22 eggs (11 x 2 = 22). Therefore, Rebecca has 22 eggs.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 jaja and she wants to divide them into 4 groups. Since there are 6 kuglica, we can assume that each group will have at least 2 jaja (since 6 / 4 = 1.5). So, let's round up to 3 jaja per group. Therefore, each group will have 3 jaja.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. If she wants to divide them into three groups, we can assume that each group will have an equal number of marbles and eggs. So, let's start by dividing the marbles equally among the three groups: Group 1 will get 2 marbles (since there are 4 marbles total), Group 2 will get 1 marble (since there are now only 3 marbles left), and Group 3 will also get 1 marble (since there are now only 2 marbles left). Now, let's distribute the remaining eggs equally among the three groups: Group 1 will get 5 eggs (since there are 15 eggs total), Group 2 will get 3 eggs (since there are now only 12 eggs left), and Group 3 will get 7 eggs (since there are now only 9 eggs left). Therefore, the number of eggs in each group is: Group 1 - 5 eggs, Group 2 - 3 eggs, and Group 3 - 7 eggs.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 6. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these eggs. To do this, we can use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 18 by 6 to see how many groups we can make.  When we divide 18 by 6, we get 3. This means that Rebecca can make 3 groups of 6 eggs each.  Now let's consider the other information given in the problem. We know that Rebecca also has 72 bananas and 66 kuglica (which are probably small balls). These items don't affect the number of groups Rebecca can make with her eggs, so we can ignore them for now.  Therefore, the final answer is:  Groups = 3;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 3, then each group will have 3 bananas and 1 egg. Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed is: Number of groups = Total amount of items / Amount per group = 99 + 9 = 108 groups So there will be 108 groups of 3 bananas and 1 egg each.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 jaja and 6 kuglica. If she wants to divide them into groups of 5, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these numbers. To do this, we can use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we want to divide 20 by 5 to see how many groups of 5 jaja Rebecca can make.  So, let's perform the calculation: 20 / 5 = 4. This means that Rebecca can make 4 groups of 5 jaja each. Therefore, Rebecca has more than 5 jaja left over after making those 4 groups.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and wants to divide them into groups of 20. Since each group requires at least one marble as a divider, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of marbles available for division. Therefore, the number of marbles available for division is 5 - 1 = 4. Now, let's calculate how many jars are required to hold all these marbles:  Number of jars needed = Total number of marbles / Number of marbles per jar = 4 / 2 = 2 So, Rebecca has 2 more jars than she has marbles. In other words, Rebecca has 5 marbles and 3 jars, which means she has 2 extra jars.;
"Response:  If Luke played $n$ rounds of trivia and scored $\boxed{b}$ points in each round, then he totalled $\boxed{nb}$ points for all rounds combined.  In this case, we are given that Luke scored $\boxed{154}$ points in total, so we can set up the equation:
$$\boxed{nb} = \boxed{154}$$
Now, we know that Luke played $n$ rounds of trivia, since he scored $\boxed{11}$ points in each round (as stated in the question). Therefore, we can substitute $n$ into the above equation to get:
$$\boxed{n(11)} = \boxed{154}$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$n = \boxed{13}$$
So, Luke played $13$ rounds of trivia.";
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a trivia game and received 46 points in each round, then he would have scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \text {Number of rounds} \times \text{Points per round} $$

In this case, the number of rounds is given as $177$, and the points per round are also given as $46$. Therefore, we can calculate the total score as follows:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total score}} = 177 \times 46 = 8322 $$

So, Luke scored a total of $8322$ points in the $177$ rounds of the trivia game.";
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of trivial games and he received the same number of points in each round as the points he scored in each round, then we can write an equation based on this information: Points = x + y where x is the number of points Luke scored in the first round and y is the number of points Luke scored in the second round. Since Luke scored 84 points in total, we know that x + y = 84. Now let's solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Using substitution method, we get: x + y = 84 (1) x = 42 (2) y = 42 - 42 = 0 (3) Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in the first round and 42 points in the second round.;
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of the game, then he would have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,982 points in the entire game.;
Response:  If Luke played 5 rounds of trivia and got 3 points in each round, he would have scored a total of 15 points (3 x 5 = 15). Since he also received 78 bonus points for answering all questions correctly, his final score is 93 points (15 + 78 = 93). Therefore, Luke played 5 rounds of trivia.;
Response:  If Emily had 2 pearls and could make 32 ohrlices, then she must have made 32/2 = 16 pairs of earrings. Since each pair consists of two earrings, there are 16 x 2 = 32 earrings in total. Therefore, the number of crowns needed for each earring is 32 / 1 = 32 crowns.;
"Response:  If Emily made 11 ogrlica and each ogrlica has 28 krunica, then the total number of perls used by Emily is:

11 x 28 = 308

So, there were 308 perls used by Emily to make her friend's friendship bracelets.";
Response:  If each ogrlica has 8 kruneta and Emily has 16 kruneta, then she can make 2 times more ogrlica than usual (or 2 x 8 = 16). So, Emily can make 16 ogrlica in total.;
Response:  If Emily made 18 ogrlica and had 6 crowns, then each ogrlica required 3 crowns (since 18 / 6 = 3).;
Response:  If Emily made 4 ogrlice and each ogrlica has 5 pera, then she had in total 20 pera (4 x 5 = 20). So, the correct answer is 20 pera.;
Response:  If Emily has 72 friendships and each friendship requires 3 pearls for an earring, then she needs 216 pearls in total (72 x 3 = 216). Since she has 6 crowns, which means she can make 6 x 3 = 18 earrings with one crown. So, Emily can make a total of 216 / 18 = 12 earrings.;
Response:  If Emily had 5 crowns and could make 20 ogrlices, then she would have made 20/5 = 4 ogrlices with each crown. So, to make one ogrlice, Emily needed 4 crowns.;
Response:  We know that Emily has 44 friends and she made 26 ogrlicas for them. Since each ogrlica contains 2 crowns, we can calculate the total number of crowns as follows: Number of crowns = Total number of ogrlicas x Number of crowns in each ogrlica Crowns = 26 ogrlicas x 2 crowns/ogrlica = 52 crowns So, there are 52 crowns in total. Now, let's find out how many perls Emily had. According to the question, each friend of Emily received an ogrlica with two crowns, which means that each ogrlica contained two perls (one for each friend). Therefore, the total number of perls Emily had is equal to the total number of crowns divided by the number of perls in each ogrlica. Perls = Crowns / Number of perls in each ogrlica Perls = 52 crowns / 2 perls/ogrlica = 26 perls So, Emily had 26 perls in total.;
Response:  We know that out of 819058 children from the district of Lawrence, 668278 stayed at home during the summer vacation. So, we have to find the difference between these two numbers. To do this, we can use subtraction:  Number of children who went to camp = 819058 - 668278 = 150777. Therefore, more than half (150777) of the children from the district of Lawrence spent their summer vacation in camp rather than staying at home.;
Response:  We know that out of 1,000,000 children in the county, 937,500 (93.75%) went to camp and 62,500 (6.25%) stayed at home. So, there are 62,500 more children who stayed at home compared to those who went to camp. Therefore, the answer is 62,500.;
Response:  We know that 629424 - 898051 = -270567 children stayed in camp. So, there are -270567 children who remained at home.;
Response:  We know that there are 313.473 children in total and during summer vacation, 274.865 of them stay at home while others go to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who go to camp as follows: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children staying at home Number of children staying at home = 313.473 - 274.865 = 38.608 Therefore, 38,608 children go to camp during summer vacation.;
Response:  We know that out of 907611 children in the district, 455682 go to camp during summer vacation. So, the number of children who stay at home is:  Number of children who stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who go to camp = 907611 - 455682 = 451939 children.;
Response:  We know that out of 828521 children in the county of Lawrence, 800059 go to camp during summer vacation. This means that 28466 ( = 828521 - 800059) children stay at home. Therefore, there are 28466 children who remain at home.;
Response:  We know that out of 91676 children in the district of Lawrence, 61619 stayed at home while the rest went to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, 30057 children from the district of Lawrence went to camp during the summer holidays.;
Response:  We know that out of 34044 children from the district of Lawrence, 34044 x 5 = 170220 children went to camp.  And we also know that out of the remaining 134867 children, 424944 x 5 = 212420 children stayed at home. Therefore, the total number of children who attended the camp is 170220 + 212420 = 382640 children.;
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children from the district of Lawrence, 30000 go to camp during summer vacation. So, the number of children who stay at home is:  Number of children in the district - Number of children going to camp = 610769 - 30000 = 580769 Now we need to add the number of additional children from outside the district who attended the camp: Additional children from outside the district x (Number of children in the district) / Total number of children attending camp = 22 x (580769) / 610769 = 400 Therefore, there are 400 children left behind in the district of Lawrence.;
Response:  We know that out of 644997 children in the district, 893835 have gone to camp and 78 are from outside the district. So, we can calculate the number of children left behind as follows: Number of children left behind = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp = 644997 - (893835 + 78) = 644997 - 894613 = -250026 children. Therefore, there are 250026 children left behind in the district of Lawrence.;
Response:  We know that Adam has more than three apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has 9 apples and he has more than 3, then we can say that Jackie has at least 6 apples (since 9 - 3 = 6). Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.;
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has. So, the answer is: Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie.;
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is: 10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.;
Response:  Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out who has more apples, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, if we subtract 8 (the number of apples Adam has) from 10 (the number of apples Jackie has), we get 2. Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.;
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. If there are more apples than Adam and Jackie have together, then we can say that the difference between the total number of apples and the number of apples they have is equal to the number of additional apples. So, if there are 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie have together, then the total number of apples must be 10 (6 + 4). Therefore, the answer is 10.;
Response:  We know that Ima has more than 9 apples together with Adam and Jackie. So, if they have 7 apples together, then Ima must have at least 2 more apples than them (7 + 2 = 9). Therefore, Ima has 9 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. So, if they had fewer than 12 apples between them, then Adam would have more than he does (since he has 8 more apples than Jackie). Therefore, we can conclude that Adam has at least 4 apples (since he has 8 more than Jackie, who has 0). Now, let's count how many apples each of them has:  Adam - 4 + Jackie - 0 = 4  So, there are 4 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 4 apples and less than or equal to 10 apples. So, he must have exactly 7 apples (since no number between 5 and 10 is included in the statement). Moreover, we are told that Adam and Jackie together have 6 more apples than they have individually. Therefore, if Adam has x apples, Jackie will have x + 6 = 12 apples. Now, since Jackie has 10 apples initially, she will gain 6 apples from Adam. So, her final apple count will be 10 + 6 = 16 apples. As for Adam, his final apple count will be x - 6 = 1 apple. Thus, Adam has 1 apple.;
Response:  We know that Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples. So, if Adam has more than Jackie, he must have at least 11 apples as well. Therefore, the number of apples Adam has is greater than 11. Now we can use the information provided in the question to find out how many apples Adam actually has. According to the question, Adam has more apples than Jackie does. Since Jackie has 11 apples, Adam must have at least 12 apples (since he has more than Jackie). But since Jackie also has 89 oranges, it means that Adam has fewer oranges than Jackie does. So, the total number of apples Adam has is 12, and the total number of oranges he has is less than 89.;
Response:  Yesterday (yestarday), Helen baked 31 cookies. Today, she will bake 270 more cookies. And tomorrow, she will bake another 419 cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked: 31 + 270 + 419 = 620 cookies until now. Therefore, the answer is 620.;
Response:  Yesterday (last night), Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies. Today (morning), she will bake 51 more chocolate cookies and 484 chocolate cookies in total. So, the final number of chocolate cookies that Helen will bake is: 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies.;
Response:  Yesterday (yesterda), Helen baked 86 grapes and 527 chocolate cookies. Today (today), she baked 86 more grape and 554 more chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 86 + 86 = 172 grape and 554 + 527 = 1081 chocolate cookies. Therefore, the number of chocolate cookies that Helen has baked is 1081.;
Response:  Yesterday (yesterda), Helen prepared 144 chocolate cookies and 397 grapes cookies. Today (today), she baked 85 grape cookies and 403 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 144 + 85 = 229 cookies yesterday and today.;
Response:  Yesterday (last night), Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies and today she will bake 237 more chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 256 chocolate cookies (19 + 237). Now, let's find out how many more chocolate cookies Helen has baked than grape cookies. The number of grape cookies that Helen baked is given as 231. Therefore, we can calculate the difference between the number of chocolate and grape cookies as follows: Number of chocolate cookies - Number of grape cookies = 256 - 231 = 25. So, Helen has baked 25 more chocolate cookies than grape cookies.;
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and today she will bake 75 more. So, yesterday she baked 122 more than today. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate cookies Helen baked yesterday and today is 122.;

Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So, together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we need to find out how many games Katie's old friends have. According to the question, Katie's old friends have 53 games. Therefore, the total number of games that all of Katie's friends have is 179 (Katie's new friends) + 53 (Katie's old friends) = 232 games.;
Response:  We know that Katie had 78 new games and her friends had 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.;
Response:  We know that Katie had 84 new games and her friends had 8 new games. So together they have 84 + 8 = 92 new games. Now we need to find out how many old games they have in total. From the question, we know that Katie had 19 old games and her friends had 69 old games, so their combined total of old games is 19 + 69 = 88. Therefore, the number of new games that Katie and her friends have together is 92 - 88 = 4.;
Response:  We know that Katie had 80 old games and her friends had 41 old game. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.;
Response:  If Katie had 57 games and then gained 6 more, she would have 63 games in total. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games she already had (57) from the total number of games she now has (63). Therefore, the answer is: Katie has 6 more games than her friends.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now we are told that her friends have 34 new games. So, the total number of games owned by Katie and her friends together is: 96 + 34 = 128. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and then he spent $20 on something. So, his new amount of money is $40. Then, Jason started with $19 and earned $33 after working for the weekend. Therefore, Jason gained $33 - $19 = $14.;
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $86 and then he spent $20 on something. So now he has $66 left. Then, Jason had $5 and didn't work, so he still has $5. Now, let's add their money together: $66 + $5 = $71. Therefore, they have a total of $71 together.;
Response:  If Fred had $19 and earned $21 during the week, then he has $40 now (since $19 + $21 = $40). Similarly, if Jason had $16 and earned $43 during the week, then he has $69 now ($16 + $43 = $69). So, Fred earned $21 during the week, which is equal to his current balance of $40.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and he spent $30 on gas. So, his remaining amount of money is $84. Now, let's see what happened to Jason. We are told that Jason had $22 last week and he earned $56 over the weekend. Therefore, his new amount of money is $78. To find out how much Jason earned during the weekend, we need to subtract his initial amount from his new amount: $78 - $22 = $56. So, Jason earned $56 over the weekend.;
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 last week and he earned $4 dollar more this week, so his new amount is $115. Similarly, Jason had $40 last week and he earned $6 dollars more this week, so his new amount is $46. Now we need to find out how much they earned from delivering newspapers. Since Fred delivered autos for 3 days and Jason did it for 2 days, their total earnings from delivering newspapers are: Fred - $115 / 3 = $38.33 per day Jason - $46 / 2 = $23.00 per day So, their total earnings from delivering newspapers are: Fred - $38.33 x 3 = $115.99 Jason - $23.00 x 2 = $46.00 Therefore, they together earned $162.99 from delivering newspapers.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 last week and he earned $73 this week, so his new amount is: $49 + ($73 - $3) = $50 + $69 = $129. Now, let's calculate Jason's earnings. We know that he had $3 last week and he earned $37 this week, so his new amount is: $3 + ($37 - $3) = $3 + $34 = $37. Therefore, Jason earned $37 from delivering newspapers.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 dollars and he spent $14 dollars for delivering newspapers, so now he has $31 - $14 = $17 dollars left.  Then, we know that Fred had $78 dollars and he spent nothing for delivering newspapers, so now he has $78 unchanged. So, their total earnings from delivering newspapers are $17 + $78 = $95 dollars.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 last week and he spent $16 on newspapers. So, his remaining amount of money is: $33 - $16 = $17. Then, he earned $74 for washing cars over the weekend. Therefore, his total earnings for the weekend are: $17 + $74 = $91.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and he spent $111 for newspapers and $34 for car wash. So, his new balance is:  $47 + ($111 - $34) = $82. Therefore, Fred has $82 now.;
Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg to start with and then lost 20 kg (which is equal to 440 grams per day), it means she lost a total of 20 x 30 = 600 grams per week. So after one week, she would have lost 600 grams / 7 days = 85 grams per day. Therefore, after one week, Jessie would weigh 71 - 85 = 66 kg.;
Response:  Before she started running every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg (or 59.4 lbs). If she lost 101 kg after starting to run daily, then her current weight is:  Weight before = 27 kg - 101 kg = 74 kg (or 163.1 lbs) So, Jessie initially weighed 74 kg or 163.1 lbs before she started running every day and lost 101 kg or 222.8 lbs.;
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. If she lost weight at a rate of 0.5 kg per day (which is a reasonable estimate for someone who starts running regularly), it would take her approximately 253 days to lose 126 kg. So, if she started running every day after weighing 126 kg, she would have lost around 126 - 66 = 60 kg. Therefore, before starting to run daily, Jessie weighed around 60 kg.;
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running for 20 days, she lost 35 kg, which means she now weighs 34 kg (69 - 35 = 34).;
Response:  In the first week, she lost 50 kg, so her new weight is: $W_1 = W_0 - 50$ kg $= 114 - 50 = 64$ kg $= 64$ kg In the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so her new weight is: $W_2 = W_1 - 60$ kg $= 64 - 60 = 8$ kg $= 8$ kg Therefore, Jessie now weighs $W_2 = 8$ kg.;
Response:  Before she started running, Jessie weighed 9 kg. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, so her new weight is: 9 kg - 62 kg = 53 kg. In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, so her new weight is: 53 kg - 140 kg = 87 kg. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 87 kg.;
Response:  After one week of running, she lost 56 kg in the first week and 99 kg in the second week. So, her weight after the first week is: 56 + (99 - 92) = 73 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed 73 kg after the first week of running.;
Response:  We know that there were 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the zoo enclosure. If we assume that each snake is hiding behind one of the alligators (which seems reasonable), then we can calculate how many snakes are hidden as follows: Number of snakes = Total number of snakes / Number of alligators x Total number of snakes per alligator So, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this equation, we get: Number of snakes = 95 / 61 x 95/6 = 57 Therefore, there are 57 snakes hidden behind the alligators in the zoo enclosure.;
Response:  We know that there were 93 snakes and 97 alligators in the zoo enclosure. If we take away 40 alligators from this total number of animals, then we have: Number of alligators = Total number of animals - Number of alligators taken away Number of alligators = 93 + 40 = 133 Therefore, there are 133 alligators left in the enclosure after taking away 40 alligators.;
Response:  We know that in the zoo there were initially 75 alligators and 3 snakes. If we add 82 more snakes to this number, then the total number of reptiles in the zoo will be: 75 + 82 = 157. Since there are already 3 snakes in the enclosure, and now we have added 82 more, the total number of snakes in the enclosure is: 3 + 82 = 85. Therefore, there are 85 aligators hiding in the enclosure.;
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the zoo enclosure. If we subtract the number of snakes (24) and alligators (51), we get: 79 - 24 = 55. So, there are 55 other animals besides snakes and alligators in the enclosure.;
Response:  If farmer had 171 tomatoes yesterday and took out 134, he has 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left in his garden today.;
"Response:  If farmer had 160 radishes in his garden and he took 56 yesterday and 41 today, then we can calculate how many radishes are left as follows:

Yesterday (56): Radish count = 160 - 56 = 104
Today (41): Radish count = 104 - 41 = 63
So, there are 63 radishes left from yesterday's harvest.";
Response:  If farmer had 90 radishes in his garden at first and took 154 yesterday and 50 today, then he has taken a total of 204 radishes from his garden (154 + 50). So, the number of radishes left in the garden is 90 - 204 = -114. Therefore, the farmer has collected -114 radishes.;
Response:  If farmer had 175 radishes and 77 carrots in his garden before buying more carrots, then he has 175 + 77 = 252 vegetables in total.  After buying additional 172 carrots, the total number of carrots would be 77 (initial) + 172 = 249 carrots. So, the number of radishes after buying additional carrots is 252 - 249 = 3 radishes.;
"Response:  If farmer had 177 radishes and 12 carrots in his garden before buying 53 radishes, then he has:
Radishes: 177 - 53 = 124 radishes left
Carrots: 12 - 0 = 12 carrots left
Therefore, farmer has 124 radishes and 12 carrots left in his garden after buying 53 radishes.";
"Response:  We know that Farmer has 105 green peppers and 71 red peppers in his garden initially. If he buys 137 bell peppers, then we can calculate how many are left as follows:

Total number of peppers = Number of green peppers + Number of red peppers
= 105 + 71
= 176

Now, let's subtract the number of bell peppers bought (137) from the total number of peppers:

Number of peppers left = Total number of peppers - Number of bell peppers bought
= 176 - 137
= 39

Therefore, there are 39 peppers left in Farmer's garden after he buys 137 bell peppers.";
Response:  If Za used 4 chisels to cut out large pieces of wood for the roof, and each piece requires 2 chisels to be securely fastened, then we can calculate how many chisels John needs as follows: Number of pieces of wood = Total number of dasakes / Number of chisels required per piece = (Total number of daskes) / (2 chisels/piece) = (Number of daskes) / 2 = 2daskes / 2chisels = 1 chisel per daske So, John needs 1 chisel to securely fasten one large piece of wood for the roof.;
"Response:  We know that there are 13 large wooden beams and we need 17 pieces of wood for each beam. Therefore, the total number of pieces of wood needed is:

13 x 17 = 201

Now, we also know that in addition to the large beams, smaller beams are required for some of the other parts of the house. The question states that ""in addition to the above, he needs 8 chavlas for some small beams."" So, the total number of chavlas needed is:

201 + 8 = 209

Therefore, John needs 209 chavlas for building the house.";
Response:  If John used 11 chisels to cut out large pieces of wood for the house walls and each piece required 3 chisels to secure it, then he would have used a total of 11 x 3 = 33 chisels. However, if additional 8 chisels were used, then the total number of chisels used would be 33 + 8 = 41 chisels. So, John needs 41 dasakes for his house wall.;
Response:  We know that big planks need 15 pieces of rope to secure them and small planks need 5 pieces of rope to secure them. So if we want to secure all the planks for the wall, we will need a total of 15 + 5 = 20 pieces of rope. Now, we are asked how many ropes John needs to secure the wall. Since he is building the wall alone, he will need twice as much rope as the number of planks he has to secure. Therefore, John needs 2 x 20 = 40 pieces of rope to secure the entire wall.;
Response:  We know that each large wooden plate requires two pieces of rope to secure it. So, if John is using 16 plates for the wall, he will need 8 pairs of ropes (or 16 ropes). Therefore, John needs 16 ropes.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 big wooden boards used for building the house walls. Each board requires 74 pieces of wood to be secured with nails. So, we need to calculate how many nails are needed in total: Number of nails = Total number of boards x Number of pieces of wood per board = 8 boards x 74 pieces/board = 596 pieces of wood. Now, we can find out how many nails John needs to buy: Number of nails = Total number of nails / Number of nails per package = 596 pieces / 10 packages (as mentioned in the question) = 59.6 packages of nails.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 large planks and 17 small planks in total.  Each large plank requires 14 chunks of wood to secure it, so we need (12 x 14) = 168 chunks of wood for the large planks alone. Similarly, each small plank requires 25 chunks of wood, so we need (17 x 25) = 425 chunks of wood for all the small planks together. Now, let's calculate how many chunks of wood John needs for the entire wall: Total number of chunks needed = Number of large planks x Number of chunks required per large plank + Number of small planks x Number of chunks required per small plank Total number of chunks needed = 12 x 168 + 17 x 425 = 3092 chunks of wood Therefore, John needs 3092 chunks of wood to build the wall.;
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of gum in total and each package contains 3 pieces of gum. So, to find out how many packages Robin has, we can divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each package: 42 / 3 = 14 packages. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum.;
"Response:  We know that there are 43 packets of gum and each packet contains 23 pieces. So, we have:

Number of packets = 43
Number of pieces in each packet = 23
Total number of pieces = Number of packets x Number of pieces per packet
= 43 x 23
= 1005
Now, we are also given that Robin has 8 pieces of gum. So, to find out how many packets Robin has, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Robin has:

Number of packets Robin has = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces Robin has
= 1005 / 8
= 126
Therefore, Robin has 126 packets of gum.";
Response:  We know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package and Robin has 6 packages of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is: 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of gum. So, Robin has 42 packages of gum.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of gum and each packet contains 4 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is: 28 packets x 4 pieces/packet = 112 pieces of gum.;
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is:

$$ NumberOfGumPieces = 21 \times 9 = 189 $$
Now let's move to the second part of the question. We are told that Robin also has 45 packages of candy, and each package contains 9 pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has is:

$$ NumberOfCandyPieces = 45 \times 9 = 375 $$
Therefore, the final answer is:

$$ TotalNumberOfPieces = 189 + 375 = 564 $$
So, Robin has a total of $564$ pieces of gum and candy.";
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of gum and 14 packets of candy. In each packet, there are 6 pieces of gum or candy. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces of gum and candy as follows: Gum: 28 packets x 6 pieces/packet = 168 pieces of gum Candy: 14 packets x 6 pieces/packet = 84 pieces of candy Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 pieces of gum and 84 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If an industrial machine can make 3 shirts in one minute and only 6 have been made altogether, then we know that the machine worked for x minutes. We are also given that the machine makes 3 shirts per minute, so if it worked for x minutes, then it must have made x/3 shirts in total. Since there were 6 shirts made in total, we can set up the equation: x/3 = 6. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 20 minutes.;
Response:  If an industrial machine can sew 5 minutes, it means that in one minute, it can sew 5/60 = 1/12 of a shirt. So, if it takes 1 minute to make 1/12 of a shirt, then it can make 4/12 = 1/3 of a shirt in 1 minute. Therefore, the machine has made 4 shirts in 5 minutes. Now, let's calculate how many T-shirts the machine has made in total. Since each shirt takes 1/3 of a minute to make, and there are 4 shirts in 5 minutes, we have: Total time taken to make all 4 shirts = 4 x (1/3) = 4/3 = 1 1/3 minutes. So, the machine has made 4 T-shirts in total.;
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts. Today, it made 44 shirts. If the machine can make 3 shirts in one minute, then it worked for...;
"Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts. If it can make 8 shirts in one minute, then it worked for...

$ \text {minutes} = \frac{\text{number of shirts}}{\text{number of shirts per minute}} $

So, yesterday the machine worked for $\boxed{\text{13 minutes}}$.
Today, the machine made 3 shirts. So, if it works at the same rate as yesterday, it will work for:

$$\text{minutes today} = \frac{\text{number of shirts today}}{\text{number of shirts per minute}} $$

So, today the machine worked for $\boxed{\text{2 minutes}}$.
Therefore, the total number of minutes that the machine worked is:

$$\text{Total minutes} = \text{yesterday minutes} + \text{today minutes}$$

$$= \boxed{\text{13 minutes}} + \boxed{\text{2 minutes}} = \boxed{\text{15 minutes}} $$

Answer: The industrial machine worked for 15 minutes in total.";
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts. Today, it made 8 shirts. If it can make 2 shirts per minute, then in one day it will have produced 144 shirts (2 x 60 = 120 minutes). So, today the machine worked for 120 minutes.;
Response:  If the machine can make 3 shirts in one minute and yesterday it made 4 shirts, then today it made 8 shirts. So, the total time the machine worked is:  Yesterday - 1 minute x 4 shirts = 4 minutes Today - 1 minute x 8 shirts = 8 minutes Total time = 4 + 8 = 12 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 12 minutes in total.;
Response:  If industrial machine can make 6 shirts in one minute and yesterday it worked for 12 minutes, then it made 72 shirts (6 x 12 = 72). And if today it worked for 14 minutes, then it made additional 96 shirts (6 x 14 = 84 + 96 = 180) Total number of shirts made by the machine is 180.;
Response:  If industrial machine can make 6 shirts in 1 minute and yesterday it worked for 5 minutes, then it made 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). Today, if it worked for 12 minutes, it made 12 x 12 = 144 shirts. So, the answer is 144 shirts.;
Response:  If they earned $165 in 5 days, that means they earned an average of $33 per day. So, they earned $33/day.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money they earned per day from selling bracelets at the carnival. We are given that they earned $144 per day. Now, let's find out how many days they were at the carnival in total. According to the question, they were there for 22 days. So, their total earnings from selling bracelets can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Number of days x Daily earnings = 22 days x $144/day = $3,076 Therefore, they earned $3,076 from selling bracelets at the carnival.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that they earned $420 in total for 30 days of playing bead toss game at the carnival. Then, we are told that together with the game, they earned an additional $22. So, if they earned $420 x 30 = $12600 in total from the game over 30 days, then the amount they earned per day is $12600 / 30 = $420 per day. Therefore, the Ring Toss game earned $420 per day.;
Response:  First 44 days = $382 x 44 = $16,596 Second 10 days = $374 x 10 = $3,740 Total amount collected = $16,596 + $3,740 = $20,336;
Response:  The carnival earned $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days for a total of $186. So, they earned an average of $11 per day during the entire carnival period.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 154 days of the carnival, Igor earned $325. This means he earned an average of $2.09 per day during this period. Now, let's find out how much he earned per day in the remaining 57 days of the carnival. We can do this by dividing the total amount he earned ($325) by the number of days left in the carnival (57). So, Igor earned $5.68 per day in the remaining days of the carnival.;
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packets of cookies and 4 packets of cookies at the store, then she has in total 10 + 4 = 14 packets of cookies. Therefore, the answer is 14.;
Response:  Paketov kolača = 4 + 22 = 26 Paketova čokolade = 16;
Response:  We know that Lucy went to the store and bought x packages of cookies. She also bought some packages of candy. The total number of packages she bought is given as 23 + n, where n is the number of packages of candy she bought. Since Lucy had 27 packages of snacks in total, we can write an equation based on this information: 23 + n = 27. Now we need to solve for n, which represents the number of packages of candy Lucy bought. To do this, we can subtract 23 from both sides of the equation: n = 4. So, Lucy bought 4 packages of candy.;
Response:  If Lucy bought 2 packets of cookies and 12 packets of cookies, she has a total of 14 packets of cookies (2 + 12 = 14).  Since she had 56 remaining at the end, we can divide the number of packets she bought by the number she had remaining to find out how many packets she originally had: 14 / 56 = 0.25 packets. So, Lucy originally bought 0.25 packets of cookies.;
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. So, now we have 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry up to 36 passengers, we know that the number of people in the bus is less than or equal to 36. Therefore, the final answer is 16 ≤ 36, and the exact value is 16 = 32.;
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 new passengers got on the bus and 3 of them got off. So, now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got into the bus, so now there are 13 people inside. Therefore, the answer is 13.;
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got into the train, so now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train. Therefore, there are currently 19 people in the train.;
Response:  If there were 22 parents in the program and a total of 676 people, then the number of children present would be equal to 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 students present at the program.;
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents and 724 students in the program. Therefore, the total number of people present at the program is:  Parents + Students = 73 + 724 = 807 people.;
Response:  If there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students, that means there are 395 people (174 + 521) in total. Therefore, to find out how many more students than parents were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people: 395 - 174 = 221. So, there were 221 more students than parents in the program.;
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students. If we multiply these two numbers together, we get 1087 (61 x 177). However, if we subtract the number of people present at the program from this total, we are left with 44 - 1087 = -1043. Therefore, the correct answer is -1043.;
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to find out how far it is from the entrance to the end of the cave. To do this, we will use the formula distance = speed x time + initial position. In this case, our initial position is the entrance of the cave, so let's call it (0, 0). The speed at which people are traveling through the cave is not given in the problem, but we can assume an average walking speed of about 3 miles per hour. Therefore, if it takes someone 1307 steps to get from the entrance to the end of the cave, then they have traveled a total distance of: distance = speed x time + initial position = 3 miles/hour x 1307 steps + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4021 feet + (0, 0) = 4;
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and they are currently at 849 feet. To find out how much longer it will take them to reach the end of the cave, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed is 17 miles per hour, so we need to find out how long it will take them to travel 369 feet (the distance from their current location to the end of the cave).  To do this, we can divide the distance by the speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 369 feet / 17 mph = 21.5 minutes. Therefore, they have 21.5 minutes left to reach the end of the cave.;
Response:  We are currently at 659 feet and the shaft is 762 feet deep. To find out how far we have to go until we reach the bottom of the shaft, we can subtract the current height from the depth of the shaft: 762 - 659 = 83 feet. So, we still have 83 feet to climb before reaching the bottom of the shaft.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 goldfish in the lake and then Macak (the cat) caught 6 golden fish leaving behind 2. So, the number of goldfish left in the lake is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 minnows in the lake initially. If the crows wanted to eat them all up, then we can assume that each crow ate one fish or minnow. So, if there were 7 goldfish and 12 minnows initially, then after the crows ate some of them, there would be 6 goldfish and 10 minnows left. Therefore, the number of fish and minnows that remained after the crows ate some of them is 6 + 10 = 16.  So, the correct answer is 16.;
Response:  According to the problem, Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 minnows in the lake. The crows wanted to eat them all up. So, Paige was left with only two goldfish. Therefore, we can conclude that 14 (16 - 2) goldfish were eaten by the crows.;
Response:  If Paige was raising 15 golden fish in the lake and the crows wanted to eat them, then we know that 5 of them were eaten. So, if we subtract 5 from 15, we get 10 remaining golden fish. Therefore, there are 10 zlatnih ribica left in the lake.;
Response:  The chef had 43 jabukes initially and after he peeled one, he had 42 jabukes left. Then, he peeled another one, leaving him with 41 jabukes. So, the chef has used 2 jabukes so far (the two that he peeled). Therefore, the number of jabukes the chef has left is 41 - 2 = 39 jabukes.;
Response:  If Kuhar had 58 apples and used 35 of them to make a pie, then he has 23 apples left (58 - 35 = 23).;
Response:  If Kuhar had 40 apples and 54 walnuts after he made a pit, then he must have started with 40 + 54 = 94 pieces of fruit in total. After he made the pit, he was left with 39 apples. Therefore, Kuhar used 94 - 39 = 55 apples to make the pit.;
Response:  If Adam can place 11 action figures on each of his four pillows, then he has a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures that he can place on his four pillows. Since there are 40 drawers in his room, and each drawer can hold one action figure, Adam cannot exceed 40 action figures in any single drawer. Therefore, the maximum number of action figures that Adam can place on each of his four pillows is 44 / 4 = 11 action figures per pillow.;
Response:  If Adam can place 10 action figures on each of his 5 shelves, then he has a total of 5 x 10 = 50 action figures. Since his room can hold 8 action figures per shelf, the total number of action figures in his room is 8 x 5 = 40 action figures. So there are 40 action figures in Adam's room.;
"Response:  If Adam can place 8 action figures and 10 boxes on each of his four poles in his room, then he has a total of:

8 x 4 = 32 action figures (on all four poles)
10 x 4 = 40 boxes (on all four poles)
So there are 32 action figures and 40 boxes on Adam's poles in his room.";
Response:  We have 10 gardens with 544 pots in total. Each pot has 32 flowers inside it. Therefore, we have...;
Response:  We have 466 lonci and each lončica has 53 cvijeća and 181 štap in it. So, we can calculate the total number of cvijeća as follows: Total number of cvijeća = Number of lonci x Number of cvijeća per lončić Total number of cvijeća = 466 x 53 = 24,780 cvijeća Now, let's calculate the total number of štapova: Total number of štapova = Number of lonci x Number of štapova per lončić Total number of štapova = 466 x 181 = 85,966 štapova Therefore, there are 24,780 cvijeća and 85,966 štapova in total.;
Response:  We have 141 lončica and each lončica has 71 cvijeće inside it. So, we can calculate the total number of cvijeće as follows: Total no. of cvijeće = Number of lončica x No. of cvijeće in each lončica Total no. of cvijeće = 141 x 71 = 9671 cvijeće Now, there is also one štap in each lončica, so let's add that to our calculation too: Total no. of cvijeće + Total no. of štapi = 9671 + 91 = 9762 cvijeće Therefore, there are 9762 cvijeće in total.;
Response:  We know that each bottle has 40 cloves in it and there are total of 400 cloves. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of bottles = Total number of cloves / Number of cloves per bottle.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of bottles = 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 bottles in total.;
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 gumballs. To find out how many groups of each size we have, we can divide the total number of candies by the number of candies per group. If we assume that each group contains an equal number of Skittles and gumballs, then... See full solution

Answer: The number of groups is $ \frac{4502}{154} = 30 $. So, each group has $\boxed{30}$ Skittles and $\boxed{30}$ gumballs.";
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in the collection and 4950 gumballs. To find out how many groups of gumballs we can make with these numbers, we need to divide the number of gumballs by the number of Skittles. So, if we divide 4950 by 3941, we get: $ \frac{4950}{3941} = 12 $ Therefore, each group of gumballs contains 12 gumballs.;
"Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 517 gumballs and 90 vending machines. To find out how many groups of Skittles there are, we need to divide the total number of Skittles by the number of items per group. If each group contains an average of 42 Skittles (based on the information provided), then the number of groups is:

Number of groups = Total number of Skittles / Number of items per group
= 896 Skittles / 42 Skittles per group
= 21.5 groups
So, there are approximately 21 groups of Skittles in Steven's collection.";
