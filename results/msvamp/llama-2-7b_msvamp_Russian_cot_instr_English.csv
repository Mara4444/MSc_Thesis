Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 18 children on Monday (понедельник) and 10 children on Tuesday (вторник). So, she played hide and seek with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference between these numbers is 8 (18 - 10 = 8). Therefore, Julia played hide and seek with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 11 children on Monday (понедельник). On Tuesday (вторник), she played with 12 children. So, Julia played with more children in Tuesday than in Monday. The difference between 11 and 12 is 1. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 5 children on Monday (понедельник). Then she played with additional 10 children on Tuesday (вторник). So, in total, Julia played with 15 children.
"Response:  Julia played hide and seek with some children on Monday (понедельник). She also played with another group of children on Tuesday (вторник). So, in total, she played with 16 children. Now, let's calculate how many children she played with each day:
Monday (понедельник): 14 children x 1 = 14 children
Tuesday (вторник): 16 children - 14 children = 2 children
Therefore, Julia played with 14 children on Monday and 2 children on Tuesday, for a total of 16 children."
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 16 children in Monday. If she played more children than Tuesday, then she played 12 children in Tuesday. So, Julia played 4 children (16 - 12 = 4) in Tuesday.
"Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 14 children on Wednesday (in Russian ""Вторник""). If she played with more children in Monday than on Wednesday, then she played with 8 children on Monday. So, Julia played hide and seek with 8 children on Monday."
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 17 children on Monday (Monday), 15 children on Tuesday (Tuesday), and 2 children on Wednesday (Wednesday). So in total, she played hide and seek with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, in total she played with 33 children (15 + 18). Now, let's consider Wednesday. The question states that Julia played with 97 children on Wednesday. Therefore, we can conclude that Julia played with a total of 130 children (33 + 97) across all three days.
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 5 children on Monday (понедельник), 9 children on Tuesday (вторник), and 15 children on Wednesday (среда). So, in total, she played hide and seek with 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children.
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 2 children on Monday (Пряlika), with 14 children on Tuesday (Втa), and with 16 children on Wednesday (Среда). So, she played with 14 + 16 = 30 children in total during those days.
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 9 children on Monday (понедельник), 7 children on Tuesday (вторник), and 96 children on Wednesday (среда). So, we need to find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  Julia played with 14 children on Monday (понедельник), 2 children on Tuesday (вторник), and 8 children on Wednesday (среда). So, in total, she played with more children on Monday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is:
A) More than 8 children."
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 8 children on Monday (Понедельник), 11 children on Tuesday (Вторник), and 9 children on Wednesday (Среда). So, we need to find out how many children she played with more in Tuesday than in Wednesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday: 11 - 9 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
"Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday (понедельник), 18 children on Tuesday (вторник), and 7 children on Wednesday (среда). So, we need to find out how many more children she played with on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday. We can do this by subtracting the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the total number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday:
Number of children Julia played with on Monday + Number of children she played with on Tuesday - Number of children she played with on Wednesday = 15 + 18 - 7 = 26
So, Julia played with 26 more children on Monday and Tuesday than she did on Wednesday."
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 13 children on Monday and with 10 children on Tuesday. Therefore, she played hide and seek with a total of 23 children (13 + 10). On Wednesday, she played cards with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played games with 38 children (23 + 15).
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 7 children on Monday (Понедельник) and with 13 children on Tuesday (Вторник). Therefore, she played hide and seek with a total of 7 + 13 = 20 children.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 12 children on Monday (Понедельник) and with 14 children on Tuesday (Вторник). So, she spent a total of 34 hours playing hide and seek in both days combined. Now, we need to find out how many children Julia played hide and seek with altogether. To do this, we can divide the total time she spent playing hide and seek by the number of days she played. In this case, 34 hours / 2 days = 17 hours per day. Since each day had a different number of children, we need to multiply the number of children by the time she spent playing hide and seek per day to get the total number of children she played with: 12 children x 17 hours/day = 204 hours and 14 children x 17 hours/day = 218 hours. Therefore, Julia played hide and seek with a total of 204 + 218 = 422 children.
Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 19 children on Monday (P) and 18 children on Tuesday (T). So, she spent a total of 38 hours playing hide and seek in both days combined. Now, we need to find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday. We can do this by subtracting the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  Julia played hide and seek with 5 children on Wednesday (in Russian ""Вторник""). Then she played with 6 children on Monday (in Russian ""Понедельник""). So, we can say that Julia played with more children in Monday than in Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is: 6 - 5 = 1."
Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. On Monday (Понедельник), she played with 4 of them, so there were 18 - 4 = 14 children left to play with on Tuesday (Вторник). Therefore, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 6 children in Monday and 17 children in Tuesday. So, she played with more children in Tuesday than in Monday (17 - 6 = 11). Therefore, Julia played with 11 more children in Tuesday than in Monday.
Response:  Bobbi ate some pieces of candy at first and then he ate another 25 pieces. So, if he ate 43 pieces in total, that means he ate x pieces initially. Since he ate 25 more pieces after eating x pieces initially, we can write an equation as follows: x + 25 = 43. Now, solving for x, we get: x = 18. Therefore, Bobbi ate 18 pieces of candy initially.
Response:  Bobbi first ate 28 candies and then he ate another 42. So, in total, he ate 28 + 42 = 70 candies.
Response:  Bobbi ate 33 chocolates and then he ate another 4. So, in total, he ate 33 + 4 = 37 chocolates. Additionally, he also ate 14 pieces of shocholate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobbi ate is 37 (chocolates) + 14 (shochtle) = 51.
Response:  Bobbi ate 38 candies first and then he ate another 36 candies. So, in total, he ate 38 + 36 = 74 candies. Now, we are told that he also ate 16 chocolates. Therefore, the number of candies that Bobbi ate is 74 - 16 = 58 candies more than the number of chocolates he ate. Since Bobbi ate 16 chocolates, the number of candies he ate is 58 x 2 = 116 candies. 
Response:  Bobbi had 20 pieces of candy initially and then he ate 34 pieces. So, his remaining candies were 20 - 34 = 14. Then, he ate another 18 pieces, so now he has 14 - 18 = -4 pieces of candy (negative because he consumed more than what he had). Therefore, Bobbi did not eat any candy in total.
Response:  Bobbi had 21 pieces of candy initially and he ate 5 pieces. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces left. Therefore, Bobbi has 7 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Bobbi had 22 pieces of candy initially. He ate some and then he ate another 5. So, after eating both amounts, he has 8 pieces left. To find out how many pieces he ate in total, we can divide the number of pieces he started with (22) by the number of pieces he has left (8). This gives us 3 (pieces per each piece he ate). Therefore, Bobbi ate 3 pieces of candy initially.
Response:  Bobbi had 19 pieces of candy initially. He ate 2 pieces of candy, so he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left.
Response:  We know that Bobbi had 32 pieces of candy initially and he ate some of them. So, if he has 20 pieces left, then he must have eaten 12 pieces (32 - 20 = 12). Therefore, Bobbi ate 12 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobbi started with 36 candies and ate 17 of them. So he had 36 - 17 = 19 candies left. Then he ate another 15 candies, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 candies left. Therefore, there are 4 candies left for Bobbi.
Response:  Bobbi initially had 30 pieces of candy. If he ate 23 pieces, then he has 7 remaining (30 - 23 = 7). So, there are 7 pieces of candy left for Bobbi.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 air balloons and Jake brought 3 air balloons to the park. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of air balloons brought by Allan = 5 Number of air balloons brought by Jake = 3 To find out how many more air balloons Allan has than Jake in the park, we need to subtract the number of air balloons brought by Jake from the number of air balloons brought by Allan: Number of air balloons brought by Allan - Number of air balloons brought by Jake = 5 - 3 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 more air balloons at the park that were brought by Allan compared to Jake.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 air balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 air balloons to the park. So, we can write this as an equation: 2 + x = 3, where x is the number of air balloons that Jake brought. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 1. Therefore, there are 1 more air balloon at Jake than Allan in the park.
Response:  If Allyn brought 2 balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 balloons, then together they have 5 balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, Jake brought 3 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Jake brought 6 air balloons to the park and he brought 4 more than Alan, then Alan brought x air balloons to the park. We know that the total number of air balloons brought by both Jake and Alan is 10 (6 + 4). So, we can write an equation: 6 + x = 10. Now, solve for x: x = 4. Therefore, Alan brought 4 air balloons to the park.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 air balloons to the park and Jake brought more than 6 balloons than Alan, then we can say that Jake brought x balloons to the park. So, the total number of balloons brought by both is equal to 5 + x. Now, according to the problem statement, if Jeff brought n balloons more than Jake, then he brought (n - x) balloons to the park. Therefore, the final answer is 5 + x = (n - x).
"Response: 
Alen brought 3 air balloons to the park and then bought 2 more in the park. So, he had 3 + 2 = 5 air balloons in total.
Jake brought 5 air balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake had 5 air balloons in total."
"Response: 
Alan brought 2 air balloons to the park and then bought 3 more in the park. So, Alan had 5 air balloons (2 + 3) in total.
Jake brought 4 air balloons to the park.
Therefore, the number of air balloons that Alan had was greater than the number of air balloons that Jake had in the park. The difference between these two numbers is 5 - 4 = 1.
So, there were 1 more air balloon with Alan than with Jake in the park."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Allan brought 2 air balloons to the park and then he bought 3 more in the park. So, the total number of air balloons brought or purchased by Allan is 2 + 3 = 5.
Now, we know that Jake brought 6 air balloons to the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of air balloons brought by Jake and Allan is: 6 - 5 = 1.
So, there were 1 more air balloon brought by Jake than Allan in the park."
"Response: 
Alen brought 5 air balloons and Jack brought 4 air balloons to the park. Then Alan bought 3 more air balloons in the park. So, the total number of air balloons that Alan brought to the park is:
5 + 4 = 9
Therefore, Alan brought 9 air balloons to the park."
Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and then bought 2 more in the park. So, he had 8 balloons (6 + 2) in total. Now, let's see how many balloons Jack had. He initially brought 2 balloons to the park and later bought 3 more. Therefore, Jack had 5 balloons (2 + 3) in total. Comparing both numbers, we can see that Alan had more balloons than Jack - 8 > 5. So, the correct answer is: More than 5.
Response:  Alan brought 6 balloons to the park and then bought 2 more balloons in the park. So, he had 8 balloons in total (6 + 2). Now, let's consider what happened with Jack. He initially had 3 balloons and later bought 4 more balloons in the park. Therefore, Jack had 7 balloons in total (3 + 4). Comparing both situations, we can see that Jack had more balloons than Alan in the park - 7 > 8. So, the correct answer is: Jack had more balloons than Alan in the park.
Response:  Alan brought 5 air balloons to the park and then Jack bought 3 more air balloons in the park. So, the total number of air balloons that Jack brought to the park is 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 3 air balls and 20 balls to the park. Therefore, we can write this information as follows: A = 3 + 20 = 23. Now, let's find out how many air balls and balls Jeff brought to the park. According to the question, Jeff brought 5 air balls and 59 balls to the park. So, we can write this information as follows: J = 5 + 59 = 64. Now, we need to add up all of these values to get the total number of air balls and balls in the park: Total = A + J = 23 + 64 = 87. Therefore, there were 87 air balls and balls in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 7 air balloons and 5 soccer balls to the park. Therefore, he had a total of 12 (7 + 5) items in the park. Now, we are told that Jake also brought something to the park. However, we don't know exactly what Jake brought. But since Jake brought fewer things than Allan, it means that Jake must have brought less than 12 items to the park. So, let's assume that Jake brought 6 air balloons and 4 soccer balls to the park. Therefore, the total number of air balloons and soccer balls that both Allan and Jake brought to the park is: 12 + 6 = 18.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 air balloons to the park and he and Jack together brought 6 air balloons to the park, then Jack must have brought 1 air balloon to the park. Therefore, Jack brought 1 air balloon to the park.
"Response: 
Alan brought 2 air balloons to the park and then bought 3 more there. So, in total, Alan has 5 air balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5).
Jake also brought 6 air balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 more air balloon than Alan in the park.
So, Jake has 1 more air balloon than Alan in the park."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. So he spends more time studying English than Chinese. Therefore, the number of hours he spends studying English is greater than the number of hours he spends studying Chinese by 4 hours (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we can subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese: 7 - 6 = 1. So, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than English.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and additional several hours studying Chinese every day. So, he spends total of 4 hours studying both languages each day. Therefore, he spends x hours studying Chinese per day. Since we know that x + 3 = 4 (total time spent studying), we can solve for x as follows: x = 1.
"Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and several more hours studying Chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on studying English than on Chinese, then... (1)

Ryan spends x hours studying Chinese. Since he spends 7 hours studying English, we can write an equation:
x + 7 = 9 (1)

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 9 - 7 = 2 (2)

So, Ryan spends 2 hours studying Chinese."
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and X hours studying English. If he spends X - 2 hours more than he does on Chinese, then X = 7 (since he spends 2 more hours on English). So, Ryan spends 7 hours studying English.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. If he studies for 5 days, then he will spend total of 30 hours (6 x 5) studying English and 49 hours (7 x 5) studying Chinese. So, in total, Ryan will spend 89 hours (30 + 49) studying both languages.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. If he studies for 2 days, then he will spend total of 12 hours (6 + 6) studying English and 10 hours (5 + 5) studying Chinese. So, in total, Ryan will spend 22 hours (12 + 10) studying both languages.
"Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying English every day and 4 hours studying Chinese. If he studies for 6 days, then he will spend a total of:

5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours studying English
30 hours + 4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours studying Chinese
Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 54 hours (30 hours + 24 hours) studying both languages combined over the course of 6 days."
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 86 days, then...
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day, so he spends 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week studying English. He also spends 7 hours studying Chinese and 3 hours studying Spanish, respectively. Therefore, in total, Ryan spends 144 + 7 + 3 = 154 hours per week studying all three languages combined.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day. He also spends 3 hours studying Chinese and 58 hours studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we can subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages: 6 - 3 = 3 hours. So, Ryan spends 3 more hours studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and 4 hours studying Spanish. So he spends more time studying English than Spanish. Therefore, the difference between the number of hours he spends studying English and Spanish is 3 (7 - 4) hours.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day. He also spends 5 hours studying Chinese and 4 hours studying Spanish. So, in total, he spends 7 hours (2 + 5 + 4) studying languages every day. Now, we need to find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than Spanish. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese: 5 - 4 = 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than Spanish.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day, then he spends x hours studying Chinese. Since he studies both languages daily, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 2 = 3 (total time spent studying)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 3 - 2 = 1 hour
So, Ryan spends 1 hour studying Chinese each day."
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 + 5 = 9 hours per day on language learning. Since he studies for 7 days, he spends a total of 9 x 7 = 63 hours on language learning in one week.

Response:  We know that there are 17 red persimmons and 16 green persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more red persimmons than green persimmons there are, we can subtract the number of green persimmons from the number of red persimmons: 17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red persimmon than green persimmon in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red persimmons and 11 green persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more green persimmons than red ones, we can subtract their numbers: 11 - 5 = 6. So, there are 6 more green persimmons than red ones in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 red persimmons in the basket and ""еще нескольких"" (meaning several) green persimmons. So, the total number of persimmons in the basket is 10 + however many green persimmons there are = x. Since we want to find out how many green persimmons there are, we can set up an equation based on this information: 10 + x = 15. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green persimmons in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are more green apples than red apples in the basket. So, if there are x red apples and 3x green apples, we can write an equation as follows:

Red apples = 3Green apples

Now, let's solve for x:

Red apples = 3(x)

We also know that the total number of apples in the basket is 10. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
= 3x + 10

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (red apples and green apples). Can you use substitution or elimination to find the values of x and 3x?"
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red persimmons, 15 yellow persimmons, and 8 green persimmons in the basket. So, we can write this information as follows:

Red per..."
Response:  We know that there are 7 red persimmons in the basket, and together with them, there are 71 yellow persimmons. So, altogether, there are 7 + 71 = 78 persimmons in the basket. Now, we need to find out how many of these are green persimmons. According to the question, there are 8 green persimmons in the basket. Therefore, the number of green persimmons is 8. Since there are more green persimmons than red persimmons, we can say that the ratio of green persimmons to red persimmons is 8 : 7 or 2 : 3.
"Response:  We know that there are 2 red persimmons and 14 green persimmons in the basket. Therefore, we can write this information as follows:

Red per..."
Response:  We know that there are 19 red persimmons in the basket and 11 yellow persimmons. So, we can write this as an equation: 19 + 11 = x, where x is the number of green persimmons. Since there are 12 green persimmons, we have: 19 + 11 = 12. Therefore, there are more red persimmons than yellow persimmons in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 red persimmons in the basket and 16 green persimmons in the basket. So, we can write this as follows:

Red persekns = 6
Green persekns = 16
Now, let's find out how many total persimmons are in the basket:
Total persimns = Red + Green = 6 + 16 = 22
Therefore, there are 22 persimmons in the basket, including both red and green ones."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red persimmons in the basket and 14 yellow persimmons. So, we have:

Red persekns = 18
Yellow persekns = 14
Total number of persimmons = Red + Yellow = 32
Therefore, there are 18 red persimmons and 14 yellow persimmons in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red persimmons in the basket, and each red persimmon represents 2 percents of total number of persimmons (since there are 100% of them). So, we have:

5 red persimmons x 2% = 10% of total persimmons are red

Now, let's find out how many yellow and green persimmons are in the basket:

Total number of persimmons = Red + Yellow + Green
= 100 - 10% = 90%

So, there are 90% of persimmons that are not red, which means they are either yellow or green. Since there are 14 yellow persimmons and 6 green persimmons, we can calculate their percentage as follows:

Yellow persimmons = 14/90 x 100% = 15.5%
Green persimmons = 6/90 x 100% = 6.7%

Therefore, there are 15.5% of yellow persimmons and 6.7% of green persimmons in the basket."
Response:  In each basket, there are 65 baskets with apples. Since there are 7 red apples and 3 green apples in each basket, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows: Total number of red apples = 7 x 65 = 455Total number of green apples = 3 x 65 = 195Total number of apples in each basket = Red apples + Green apples = 455 + 195 = 650So, there are 650 apples in each basket.
Response:  We have 11 baskets with apples. In each basket, there are 10 red apples and 18 green apples. So, in total, we have... (calculate)...perhaps you can help me here!
Response:  There are 6 baskets in total, and each basket contains 16 red apples and 18 green apples. Therefore, there are 6 x 16 = 96 red apples and 6 x 18 = 108 green apples in total. So, the number of red apples is 96, and the number of green apples is 108.
Response:  There are 7 baskets with persimmons. In each basket, there are 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons. So, in total, we have 7 x 10 = 70 red persimmons and 7 x 2 = 14 green persimmons. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 persimmons in all the baskets together.
Response:  We know that there are 7 per...
Response:  We know that there are two baskets with apples and each basket has 4 red apples and some green apples. So, in total, there are 8 red apples (4 x 2 = 8) and X green apples (X + 8 = 12). Therefore, the number of green apples in each basket is X / 2.
Response:  We know that there are 16 persimmons in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we subtract 13 from 16, we get 3. Therefore, there are 3 green persimmons in the basket.
"Response:  Each coracle contains 19 red apples and 4 green apples. If there are 15 coracles in total, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of red apples in all coracles.
Number of red apples = Number of coracles x Number of red apples per coracle
= 15 x 19

Response:  We know that there are 6 green persimmons in total and 2 red persimmons in total. So, we can write this as an equation: 6 + 2 = x, where x is the number of yellow persimmons. Now, we know that there are 60 yellow persimmons, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 6 + 2 = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 54. Therefore, there are 54 green persimmons more than red persimmons in the basket.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 figures on his shelf. Then he added some more figures to make it 8 in total. So, he added 4 + x figures where x is the number of additional figures he added. Therefore, x = 4.
Response:  Jerry had several figurines on his shelf initially. He then added 7 more figurines to the shelf. So, if he now has 10 figurines in total on the shelf, that means he originally had x figurines on the shelf, where x is the number of figurines he added later (i.e., 7). Therefore, Jerry had 7 + x = 10 figurines on his shelf initially. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, Jerry had 3 figurines on his shelf initially.
Response:  Jerry had 4 game figures and 22 books initially. Later, he added 6 more game figures to his collection. So, in total, there were 4 + 6 = 10 game figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 5 game figures and 9 books initially. Later, he added another 7 game figures to the shelf, so now there are 12 game figures in total (5 + 7 = 12). However, we were told that there are still 9 books on the shelf, which means that the number of books is constant at 9. Therefore, the ratio of game figures to books is 12:9 or 3:2.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 10 books and 2 toy heroes on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more toy heroes. So, now he has 2 + 4 = 6 toy heroes. Now, let's count how many books are left. We know that there were initially 10 books, so after adding 4 toy heroes, there should be 10 - 4 = 6 books left. Therefore, the number of books is 6.
Response:  Jerry had 8 game pieces and 9 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 10 books to the shelf, so the total number of books now is: 9 + 10 = 19 books. Therefore, there were 19 books on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  Jerry had 7 game figures and 2 books initially. Later, he added 4 more books to his collection. So, now he has 2 + 4 = 6 books in total. Now, let's count how many game pieces he has: 7 (initially). Therefore, there are more book than game pieces on Jerry's shelf - 6 : 7 = -1.
Response:  Jerry had 5 game figures and 2 books initially. Later, he added 9 more books to his collection. So, in total, Jerry has 5 + 2 = 7 items on his shelf. Now, let's count how many of these are books: 7 - 2 = 5 books. Therefore, there were 5 more books than game figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 figurines on his shelf in his room. Then he added 4 more and took away 5 old ones. So, there were 13 figurines on the shelf after these changes (8 + 4 - 5 = 13).
Response:  Jerry had 3 figures initially and later added 4 more. So, he has 7 figures in total now (3 + 4 = 7). To find out how many figures he removed from the shelf, we need to subtract the number of new figures (4) from the total number of figures he has now (7): 7 - 4 = 3. Therefore, Jerry removed 3 figures from his shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 7 figures on his shelf initially. Then he added some more and took away 10 old ones. So, if there are now 8 figures on the shelf, that means Jerry must have added 1 figure (not including the 10 taken away).
Response:  Jerry had several figurines on his shelf initially. Later, he added 2 more and removed 7 old ones. So, if there are currently 10 figurines on the shelf, then originally Jerry had 10 + 2 = 12 figurines on the shelf to start with.
Response:  Jerry had 9 figures and later added 7 more. So he has 9 + 7 = 16 figurines in total. Since there are also 10 books on his shelf, we can say that for every book, there are 16/10 = 1.6 figurines on the shelf. Therefore, there were 16 + 1.6 = 17 figurines on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 hero figurines initially. Later, he added 2 more hero figurines to his collection. So, in total, Jerry had 3 + 4 = 7 hero figurines. Now, let's count how many books he has. According to the question, he has 3 books. Therefore, the number of hero figurines is greater than the number of books. The correct answer is 7 > 3.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 figurines of heroes on his shelf in his room. Later, he added another 2 figurines of heroes to the shelf. So, at this point, there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. Now, we know that among these 9 items, there are more books than figurines of heroes. Therefore, the number of books is greater than the number of figurines of heroes. In other words, the ratio of books to figurines of heroes is greater than 1:2 or 5:8.
"Response:  At first, there were 2 pigeons sitting on the fence (or ""забор""). Then, more birds joined them, so now there are 6 pigeons in total. To find out how many additional birds came to sit on the fence, we need to subtract the original number of birds from the current number: 6 - 2 = 4. Therefore, 4 additional birds arrived at the fence to join the initial 2 pigeons."
Response:  At first, there were several birds sitting on the branch (we don't know exactly how many). Then, 4 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have 7 birds (initial + new) = 7 x 2 = 14 birds. Therefore, initially, there were 14 birds sitting on the branch.
Response:  We have 4 pigeons and 46 sparrows initially sitting on the branch. Then, 6 more pigeons join them. So, in total, we have 4 + 46 = 50 birds sitting on the branch.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds and 2 storks sitting on the branch (a total of 5). Then, 5 more pigeons joined them. So, in total, we have 8 pigeons and 2 storks sitting on the branch. Therefore, the answer is 8 + 2 = 10.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds and 4 sparrows sitting on the branch. Then, 2 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have:
Number of birds = 3 + 2 = 5
Number of sparrows = 4
Now, let's count how many birds are sitting with the sparrows:
5 birds (including the new ones) + 4 sparrows = 9
Therefore, there are 9 pets sitting on the branch, including both birds and sparrows."
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 pigeons and 6 sparrows sitting on the branch. Then, 3 more birds joined them, which means that now there are 5 birds in total (2 pigeons + 3 new birds). Among these 5 birds, there are 6 sparrows, so the number of sparrows is greater than the number of pigeons. Therefore, there are more sparrows than pigeons sitting on the branch.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 6 sparrows sitting on the branch. Then, 2 more sparrows joined them. So, in total, we have: 4 + 6 = 10 birds (including both types) sitting on the branch. Therefore, there are 10 airsts sitting on the branch.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 sparrows initially. Then, 6 more sparrows join them, so now we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds and 6 sparrows. Therefore, there are in total 7 birds and 6 sparrows sitting on the branch.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 6 pigeons and 3 sparrows sitting on the branch. Then, 2 more sparrows joined them. So, in total, we have:
6 + 3 = 9 pigeons
9 + 2 = 11 birds (pigeons and sparrows) sitting on the branch. Therefore, there are 11 birds more than aisthosthat sit on the branch."
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 3 sparrows sitting on the branch. Then, 6 more sparrows joined them. So, in total, we have: Birds - 4 + Sparrows - 3 = 7 (seven) pets sitting on the branch. Therefore, there are more sparrows than birds sitting on the branch.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 pigeons sitting on the branch. Then, 4 more birds and 8 bees joined them. So, in total, we have: 6 + 4 = 10 birds sitting on the branch.
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 pigeons and then 5 more pigeons joined them. So, in total, we have 7 pigeons. Now, 4 crows also joined them. Therefore, the total number of birds sitting on the branch is 7 + 4 = 11. Since only one crow can sit on the branch at a time, there are 11 pigeons and 4 crows (or 11/4 = 2.75 crows).
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 pigeons and later 2 more pigeons joined them, so now there are 5 pigeons in total. Additionally, 6 sparrows (a type of bird) also joined them, making the total number of birds sitting on the branch 11 (5 pigeons + 6 sparrows). Therefore, there are more sparrows than pigeons sitting on the branch. So, the correct answer is 6 sparrows.
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 ais and 3 birds sitting on the branch. Then, 4 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have: 5 + 3 = 8 pets. Therefore, there are more birds than ais on the branch. The correct answer is 8 - 5 = 3 more birds than ais.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 ais and 2 pigeons. So, in total, there are 8 creatures sitting on the branch (6 + 2 = 8). Then, 3 more birds join them, so now there are 11 creatures on the branch (8 + 3 = 11). Therefore, there are more ais than pigeons sitting on the branch. The correct answer is 6 - 2 = 4 ais.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the branch (not including the sparrow). Then, 6 more starlings and 2 more pigeons joined them. So, in total, we have:
3 + 6 = 9 birds sitting on the branch.
Therefore, there are more starlings than pigeons sitting on the branch."
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. So, the first chapter is 37 pages longer than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, the second chapter is 43 pages longer than the first chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 60 pages in the first chapter and 93 total pages in the book. So, if we divide 93 by 60, we get... (do math)...which means that there are approximately 15.5 pages in the second chapter!
Response:  We know that there are 36 pages in the second chapter and 67 pages in total. So, if we divide 67 by 3, we get 22 pages in the first chapter. Therefore, there are 22 pages in the first chapter of the book.
Response:  The total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in the book = Number of pages in Chapter 1 + Number of pages in Chapter 2 + Number of pages in Chapter 3 Therefore, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this equation, we get: Number of pages in the book = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Thus, there are 125 pages in the book.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, and the second chapter has 23 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can divide the number of pages in the first chapter by the number of pages in the second chapter: Number of pages in first chapter / Number of pages in second chapter = 91 / 23 = 4.06 (round up to 4). So, there are 4 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
"Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and the second chapter has 18 pages. Therefore, we can say that the difference between the number of pages in the two chapters is:

35 - 18 = 17 pages
So, there are 17 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter."
Response:  The length of each chapter is given as follows: First chapter - 53 pages, Second chapter - 75 pages, and Third chapter - 21 pages. To find out how many pages are in the first chapter compared to the third chapter, we need to divide the number of pages in the first chapter by the number of pages in the third chapter. So, if we do this calculation, we get: Number of pages in the first chapter / Number of pages in the third chapter = 53 / 21 = 2.56 (or approximately 2 pages and 60% more than the third chapter). Therefore, the first chapter is about 2 pages longer than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that each chapter has 61 pages and there are 31 chapters in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages as follows: Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, the number of pages in the book is: Number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages
Response:  The book has 2 chapters with a total of 46 pages (2 x 23 = 46). Since there are 10 pages in the first chapter, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 10 pages / 2 chapters = 5 pages per chapter. Therefore, there are 5 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter consists of pages. So, in total, there are 2 x 81 = 162 pages in the book. Now, we know that the second chapter is made up of 68 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is 68 / 2 = 34 pages.
Response:  We know that 62 people went for kayaking in the morning and 39 people went for kayaking in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who went for kayaking is: 62 + 39 = 101 people. Therefore, more people went for kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 52 people went for a hike in the morning and 61 people went for a hike in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 52 People Afternoon = 61 People Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many more people went for a hike in the afternoon than in the morning: Number of people who went for a hike in the afternoon - Number of people who went for a hike in the morning = 61 - 52 = 9 Therefore, 9 more people went for a hike in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 15 lagerniks went to climb in the morning and after that some more laregers went for climbing. So total number of laregers who went for climbing = 15 + (number of laregers who went after obe). Now we are told that total no of laregers who went for climbing is equal to 32. Therefore, we can write equation as : 15+x=32 where x is the number of laregers who went after obe. Solving this equation we get x=7. So, 7 laregers went for climbing after obe.
"Response:  We know that some people went for kayaking in the morning and 7 more did it in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who went for kayaking = Morning + Afternoon. 
Given that 60 people went for kayaking altogether, we can write an equation as follows: Morning + Afternoon = 60. Now, let's solve this equation. If x is the number of people who went for kayaking in the morning, then we have: Morning = x + 7 (since 7 more people went in the afternoon). Substituting this value into our first equation, we get: x + 7 + Afternoon = 60. Simplifying and solving for x, we find that x = 15. Therefore, 15 people went for kayaking in the morning."
Response:  In total, there are 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 lagerniks who went for a hike. Therefore, the answer is 108.
Response:  We know that 44 people went for a hike in the morning and 39 people went for a hike during the day. So, the total number of people who went for a hike is: 44 + 39 = 83. Now, we are told that 31 people went for a hike in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of people who went for a hike in the morning and those who went for a hike in the evening is: 83 - 31 = 52. So, there were 52 more people who went for a hike in the morning than in the evening.
"Response:  We know that 53 people went for a walk in the morning and 48 people went for a walk during the day. So, the total number of people who went for a walk is:

53 + 48 = 101

Now, we are told that 49 people went for a walk in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of people who went for a walk in the morning and those who went for a walk in the evening is:

101 - 49 = 52

So, there were 52 more people who went for a walk in the morning than in the evening."
Response:  We know that 33 people went for a hike in the morning and 34 people went for a hike in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who went for a hike is: 33 + 34 = 67. Now, we are told that 10 people went for a hike in the evening. Therefore, the total number of people who went for a hike during the day (morning and afternoon) is: 67 - 10 = 57. So, there were more people who went for a hike during the day than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 13 people went for kayaking in the morning and 59 people went for hiking in the morning as well. So, altogether we have 72 people who left for their activities in the morning (13 + 59 = 72). Now, let's see how many people went for kayaking after lunch. The question states that 21 people went for kayaking after lunch. Therefore, the total number of people who went for kayaking is 21 + 13 = 34 people. So, the final answer to your question is 34 people went for kayaking.
Response:  We know that 29 lazers went for kayaking in the morning and 66 lazers went for hiking in the morning as well. After lunch, 26 lazers went for kayaking. So, the total number of lazers who went for kayaking is: 29 + 26 = 55. Therefore, more lazers went for kayaking in the morning than after lunch.
Response:  We know that 41 lazers went for kayaking in the morning and 4 more left after breakfast. So, altogether they are 45 people who went for kayaking. Now, we are told that 26 of them went for kayaking after lunch. Therefore, the number of people who did not go for kayaking is 45 - 26 = 19. These 19 people must have gone for hiking.
Response:  We know that 43 lagerniks went for kayaking in the morning and several more went in the afternoon. So, the total number of lagerniks who went for kayaking is 43 + x, where x is the number of lagerniks who went in the afternoon. Since we are asked how many lagerniks went for kayaking in the daytime, we can say that x is the number of lagerniks who went in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer to the question is 43 + x = 46.
Response:  Rachel gathered 4 apples from the tree. So initially there were 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree. Therefore, there are 3 apples left on the tree.
Response:  At first, Raechel had 4 apples on the tree. She gathered some of them and now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, Raechel gathered 2 apples.
Response:  If Racheal gathered 7 ripe apples from the tree and there were initially 12 apples (including the ones she picked), then after she picked them, there were 5 apples left on the tree. Now, if 3 of those remaining apples are ripe, that means there are 5 - 3 = 2 non-ripe apples left on the tree. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Racheal picked 2 speckled apples from the tree and now there are 7 left, then initially there were 9 apples on the tree (7 + 2 = 9). Since 6 of them are mature, the number of immature apples is 3 (9 - 6 = 3). So, initially, there were 3 immature apples on the tree.
Response:  Rachel gathered 6 ripe apples from the tree. Now there are 2 ripe and 4 immature apples left on the tree. So initially, there were 6 + 4 = 10 apples on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel gathered 3 ripe apples from the tree. So, there were initially 3 + 27 = 30 apples on the tree (including both ripe and unripe ones). Now, after she picked 3 more ripe apples, there are 30 - 3 = 27 apples left on the tree (both ripe and unripe). Therefore, initially there were 30 ripe apples on the tree.
Response:  Rachel gathered 7 apples from the tree and then two more grew on the tree. So, in total, there were 9 apples (7 + 2) on the tree initially. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  Rachel had 2 apples on the tree initially. She picked 4 apples from the tree, leaving her with 2 remaining apples. Then, new apples grew on the tree, resulting in 3 additional apples. So, there are now 5 apples on the tree (2 initial + 4 picked + 3 new).
Response:  We know that Rachel has 52 apples and she took away 2 from one of her trees. So now there are 7 apples left on that tree. To find out how many apples were initially on the tree, we can use the following equation: Number of apples on the tree = Total number of apples - Number of apples taken away From this equation, we can see that if Rachel had 52 apples in total and took away 2 apples, then there must have been 50 apples initially on the tree (52 - 2 = 50). Therefore, the answer is 50.
Response:  Rachel has 3 apple trees and she gathered 8 apples from each tree. So, in total, she collected 24 apples (3 x 8 = 24). Now, there are only 9 apples left on all the trees. Therefore, initially, there were 25 apples (24 + 1 = 25) on all the trees combined.
Response:  Racheal has 4 apples and she gathered 7 from each of the remaining trees. So, the total number of apples left on the trees is 29 - (4 + 7 x 3) = 29 - 21 = 8. Therefore, Rachel collected 4 + 7 x 3 = 21 apples in total.
Response:  Ed had more marbles than Doug initially. If Ed has 20 marbles now and Doug has 19 marbles left after losing some, then Doug must have lost 1 marble. So, Doug lost 1 marble.
Response:  Ed had more than 10 mosaics than Doug. If Ed had 45 mosaics and lost some of them, then he must have had at least 35 mosaics left (since he had more than 10). So, the number of mosaics that Doug had was less than 35. Therefore, the difference between the number of mosaics that Ed had and the number of mosaics that Doug had is 35 - x, where x is the number of mosaics that Doug had. Since Doug lost 11 mosaics, his new number of mosaics would be x - 11. Now we can substitute this value in the equation to find out how many mosaics Ed had: 35 - x = x - 11. Solving for x, we get x = 24. So, Ed had 24 more mosaics than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed had more than 6 mravirs than Doug. So, if Ed had x mravirs and Doug had 6 mravirs, then we can write an equation as follows:
x - 6 = 22
Now, let's solve for x. To do this, we need to add 6 to both sides of the equation:
x = 28
So, there were 28 mravirs in total, including both Ed and Doug."
"Response:  We know that Ed had more mosaics than Doug initially. So let X be the number of mosaics Ed had at first. Since Doug lost three mosaics on the gameboard, we can write:
X - 3 = 27 (Doug's initial number of mosaics)
Now, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
X = 27 + 3
X = 30
Therefore, Ed had 30 mosaics at first, and Doug had 27 mosaics at first minus the three he lost on the gameboard."
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 24 mraimors at first and lost some of them during the game. Then he found additional 9 mramoros. So, Ed had X mramoros more than Duh initially. Since Duh lost 27 mramoros, his remaining amount is 24 - 27 = -3 mramoros. Therefore, Ed had X + 9 = 12 mramoros more than Duh. Solving for X, we get X = 15. So, Ed had 15 mramoros more than Duh.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 mramorov more than Doug. Then, Ed lost 17 of his marbles on the game board. So, how many marbles does Ed have left now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of marbles he lost from the initial amount he had more than Doug. Therefore, the answer is: Ed has 12 mramorov (29 - 17) more than Doug.
Response:  Ed had more than 19 marbles at first, so he must have started with 20 or more. Then, he lost some of them on the game board, which means that his new total is less than 20. Since Doug has fewer marbles than Ed now (8 vs 20), we can conclude that Ed lost exactly 12 marbles (20 - 8 = 12).
Response:  Ed had more than 30 mosaics than Doug. If he lost 21 mosaics at the game board, then his remaining number of mosaics would be less than 91. So, the difference between Ed's and Doug's number of mosaics is greater than or equal to 60 (i.e., 91 - 30 = 61). Therefore, Ed has more mosaics than Doug by at least 60.
Response:  Ed had more than 12 mosaics at first, so he must have started with 12 + x, where x is some number greater than 0. Then, he lost 20 of his mosaics on the game board, which means that he now has 12 + x - 20 = 12 + x - 4 = 8 mosaics left. Finally, if Ed has 17 mosaics left, then we can deduce that Duh has 17 - 8 = 9 mosaics left. So, the answer is 9.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 408 students who suggested adding potato puree and 42 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu. So, we have:

Number of students suggesting potato puree = 408
Number of students suggesting bacon = 42

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested potato puree than those who suggested bacon:

More students suggested potato puree = Number of students suggesting potato puree - Number of students suggesting bacon
= 408 - 42
= 366

Therefore, 366 students suggested carrot pudding more than those who suggested bacon."
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding potato puree and 489 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then there are more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested potato puree. Therefore, the number of students who suggested bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested potato puree. So, the answer is (489 - 479) = 10.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Sofia asked 310 students for their suggestions regarding specific dishes to add to the menu. Among them, 185 students suggested adding potato puree, while others suggested adding bacon. So, the number of students who suggested bacon is 310 - 185 = 125. Therefore, 125 students proposed adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  According to the passage, Sofia asked 288 students for their suggestions. Of these, 264 suggested adding bacon to the menu, while others suggested adding potato puree. So, the number of students who suggested potato puree is 24 (288 - 264).
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding potato puree and 63 students suggested adding bacon, then there are 457 - 63 = 404 students who did not suggest adding bacon. So, among those 404 students, 63 have suggested adding bacon, which means that 404 - 63 = 341 students have not suggested adding bacon.
Response:  If 166 students suggested adding bacon more than those who suggested potato puree (182), then we can say that 166 - 182 = x, where x is the number of students who suggested adding bacon equally as many times as those who suggested potato puree. So, there are x students who suggested adding bacon equally as many times as those who suggested potato puree.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Sofia asked students for their suggestions regarding specific food items that they would like to see added to the cafeteria menu. Now, let's analyze each response given in the problem:

* 324 students suggested adding potato puree to the menu.
* 374 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
* 128 students suggested adding tomatoes to the menu.

Now, we need to find out how many students participated in suggesting new products altogether. To do this, we can simply add up the number of students who gave each suggestion:

Total number of students = 324 + 374 + 128 = 826

Therefore, 826 students participated in suggesting new products for the cafeteria menu."
"Response:  According to the given information, we have:
Number of students who suggested adding carrot pudding = 257
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 120
Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes = 97
Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding carrot pudding than those who suggested adding bacon:
Total number of students who suggested adding carrot pudding - Total number of students who suggested adding bacon = 257 - 120 = 137
Therefore, 137 more students suggested adding carrot pudding than those who suggested adding bacon."
"Response:  According to the given information, we have:
Number of students who suggested adding carrot pudding = 144
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 467
Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes = 79
Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding carrot pudding than those who suggested adding tomatoes:
More students suggested adding carrot pudding = Number of students who suggested adding carrot pudding - Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes
= 144 - 79
= 65
Therefore, 65 more students suggested adding carrot pudding than those who suggested adding tomatoes."
"Response:  According to the given information:
Number of students who suggested adding carrot pudding = 228
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 337
Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes = 23
Now we need to find out how many more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding tomatoes. So, let's subtract the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes from the number of students who suggested adding bacon:
337 - 23 = 314
Therefore, 314 students suggested adding bacon more than those who suggested adding tomatoes."
Response:  We know that Sofia asked students to suggest specific dishes from the total of 66 options. If 450 students suggested adding potato puree and 38 suggested adding bacon, then we have a total of 488 suggestions (450 + 38). Since the remaining students did not participate, there are 172 students who did not suggest any new dish (66 - 172 = 172). Therefore, 172 students participated in suggesting new dishes.
Response:  According to the question, Sofia asked students for specific food suggestions after making her decision. If 218 students suggested adding potato puree with bacon and only 351 suggested adding bacon without any other ingredients, then we can calculate the number of students who suggested adding bacon as follows: Number of students suggesting bacon = Total number of students - Number of students suggesting potato puree with bacon So, in this case, the number of students suggesting bacon would be: Number of students suggesting bacon = 469 (total number of students) - 218 (students suggesting potato puree with bacon) = 251 Therefore, 251 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
"Response:  According to the given information:
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 269
Number of students who suggested adding potato puree = 330
Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes = 76
Now we need to find out how many more students suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding bacon.
So, let's calculate it:
Number of students who suggested adding potato puree - Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 330 - 269 = 61
Therefore, 61 more students suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding bacon."
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in school. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of girls = 569 - 236 = 333. Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys in school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, the difference between the number of boys and girls is: 841 - 34 = 807. Therefore, there are 807 more boys than girls in school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls (or female). So, the number of boys is equal to 485 minus 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in the school and 228 more than boys. So, the number of boys is equal to 697 minus 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are x girls, then there are x + 510 boys. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x + 510) = 635. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 510 = 635. Subtracting 510 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = 125. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 62. So, there are 62 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 868 students in total, then the number of girls must be greater than or equal to 868. Moreover, we were told that the number of girls is 281 more than the number of boys. Therefore, the number of boys is equal to 587 (868 - 281). Thus, there are 868 students in this school, including 587 boys and 281 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in the school. So, the total number of students is: 700 + (142) = 842. Therefore, there are 842 students in this school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in school. Then, another 418 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Similarly, total number of boys is still 222. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 1124 + 222 = 1346 students.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls in school and 811 boys. Then, another 44 girls joined the school. So, now we have to find out how many girls are left after adding these new students. The total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls - Number of boys who also joined the school. Therefore, the final number of girls in the school is: Total number of girls = 902 + 44 - 811 = 537 girls.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in school. Then, another 465 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 Number of boys = Original number of boys (410) Now, let's find out how many more girls than boys are in the school: More girls than boys = Total number of girls - Number of boys = 1097 - 410 = 687 Therefore, there are 687 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We have 732 girls in school initially and then we get additional 682 girls who come to school, so total number of girls is now = 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Similarly, for boys, there are 761 initially and then 8 more join, so total number of boys is = 761 + 8 = 769 boys. So, the total number of students in school including both boys and girls is = 1414 + 769 = 2183 students.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in school. Then, another 496 girls joined the school, so the total number of students became: 135 + 496 = 631 girls. Now, we are told that 910 more boys have joined the school, so the total number of boys is now: 214 + 910 = 1124 boys. Therefore, the final number of boys in the school is 1124.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Additionally, we know that there are 36 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 626:36 = 17:1.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in school, so together they make up 624 students (315 + 309 = 624). Now we need to add the number of teachers to this total. According to the problem, there are 772 teachers at the school, so let's add them to our total: 624 + 772 = 1396 people. Therefore, there are 1396 people in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in school. So, if there are x boys, then there are x + 402 girls. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x + 402) = 739. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 402 = 739. Subtracting 402 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = 337. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 168.5. So, there are approximately 169 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in school. So, if there are x boys and 458 girls, then there must be at least 458 + x girls. Since there are 692 total girls, we can set up the equation: 458 + x = 692. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 458 from both sides of the equation: x = 692 - 458 = 234. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in school. Then, another 403 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Boys - 362 Girls - 257 + 403 = 652 girls In total, there are more girls than boys in the school, so the number of girls is greater than the number of boys. Therefore, the answer to your question is: The number of girls is greater than the number of boys in the school by 652 - 362 = 290 girls.
Response:  Edvard had $18 initially and spent $16, so he has $18 - $16 = $2 left now.
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, the amount of money that Edward spent is equal to the difference between his initial amount ($13) and his remaining amount ($3). Therefore, the answer is $10 (=$13 - $3).
Response:  Edward spent $9 initially and then he spent another $8. So, his total spending is $9 + $8 = $17. Now, we are asked how much money was left with him before he started spending. That means we need to find out what was his initial amount of money. Therefore, the answer is $17 - $9 = $8.
Response:  Edvard spent $16 on buying 92 books, so he spent $0.18 per book ($16 / 92). Since each book cost the same amount of money, we can assume that Edvard had $92 in total before spending any money. After spending $16 on books, he has $76 left ($92 - $16 = $76).
Response:  Edvard spent $6 on buying two books. Now he has $12 left. So, each book cost him half of his remaining amount, which is $12 / 2 = $6. Therefore, each book cost $6.
Response:  Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on notebooks, so he has $6 + $16 = $22 left after buying those things.
Response:  Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on notebooks. So he has $12 left after buying them. To find out how much he spent on each item, we can divide the amount of money he had before buying them by the cost of each item. For example, to find out how much Edward spent on books, we can divide $4 by $4 = $1. So Edward spent $1 on books. Similarly, to find out how much he spent on notebooks, we can divide $3 by $3 = $1. So Edward spent $1 on notebooks. Therefore, Edward spent a total of $1 + $1 = $2 on books and notebooks.
Response:  Edvard spent $16 on books and $8 on notebooks, so he has $19 left after buying both. To find out how much more he spent on books than on notebooks, we can subtract the amount he spent on notebooks from the total amount he had left: $19 - $8 = $11. So, Edward spent $11 more on books than on notebooks.
Response:  Edward spent $17 and then received $10 from his friend. So he has $17 - $10 = $7 left. Therefore, there were initially $7 dollars with Edward before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Dэavid did more than Захарий. So, if Захарий made 44 push-ups, then Dэavid made at least 44 + 1 = 45 push-ups. Therefore, the total number of push-ups done by both boys together is: 45 (Dэavid) + 44 (Захарий) = 89 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Захари made 51 push-ups and David made 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Захари did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David made from the number of push-ups Захари made: 51 - 44 = 7. Therefore, Захари made 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 push-ups during his physical education class today. And we also know that David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if David made x push-ups, then Zachary made x - 9 push-ups. Therefore, the answer is x = 35.
Response:  We know that Dávid made 51 push-ups during his physical education class today. We also know that David did more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 51 push-ups together. Therefore, the answer is x = 49.
Response:  We know that Захари did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches during his physical education class today. David did more than 19 push-ups but fewer than 27 crunches compared to Zachary. So, David did 19 + x push-ups, where x is the difference between David's number of push-ups and Zachary's number of push-ups (i.e., 19 - 44 = -25). Since David also did fewer crunches than Zachary, he did 44 crunches minus the difference between their numbers of crunches (-25), which gives us 19 crunches. Therefore, David did 19 push-ups and 19 crunches.
"Response:  We know that D... (read more)

Question: Захарий сделал 44 отжимания и 17 скручиваний на уроке физкультуры сегодня. Дэвид сделал на 29 отжиманий больше, но на 13 скручиваний меньше, чем Захарий. Сколько скручиваний сделал Дэavid? 
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: Let's think step by step. We know that David did more push-ups than Zachary, but fewer crunches. So, if Zachary did x crunches, then David did x + 13 crunches. Since David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, we can write an equation: x = 44 - 17 = 27. Therefore, David did 27 crunches."
"Response:  We know that Захарий сделал 53 отжимания and 14 скручиваний. Dэavid did 17 more than Захарий in push-ups, but he did 10 less in crunches than Захарий. So, we can write an equation:

Number of push-ups done by Захарий = 53
Number of push-ups done by Dэavid = Number of push-ups done by Захарий + 17
Number of crunches done by Захарий = 14
Number of crunches done by Dэavid = Number of crunches done by Захарий - 10
Now we have four equations and four variables (numbers of push-ups and crunches done by both boys). Solving them simultaneously, we get:

Number of push-ups done by Захарий = 63
Number of push-ups done by Dэavid = 73
Number of crunches done by Захарий = 24
Number of crunches done by Dэavid = 34
So, Захарий did 63 push-ups and 24 crunches, while Dэavid did 73 push-ups and 34 crunches."
Response:  We know that Dэavid did more than 58 push-ups and fewer than 87 crunches than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 58 push-ups. Similarly, if Zachary did y crunches, then David did y - 87 crunches. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: Zachary's total number of exercises = David's total number of exercises + 58 (since David did more push-ups) - 87 (since David did fewer crunches). Solving for Zachary's total number of exercises, we get: Zachary did 35 + 58 = 93 exercises in total. Therefore, the answer is 93.
"Response:  We know that Захарий did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches during his physical education class today. David did more than 38 push-ups but fewer than 62 crunches compared to Захарий. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Zahary's number of crunches = 58
David's number of crunches = x

We also know that Zahary's total number of exercises (push-ups + crunches) is equal to David's total number of exercises plus 10 (since David did 38 more push-ups). Therefore, we can write another equation:

Zahary's total number of exercises = David's total number of exercises + 10

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and 10):

Equation 1: Zahary's number of crunches = 58
Equation 2: Zahary's total number of exercises = David's total number of exercises + 10

Solving for x (the number of crunches David did), we get:

x = 62 - 10 = 52

So, David did 52 crunches during his physical education class today. As for Zahary, he did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches, which means he did 10 more crunches than David."
"Response:  We know that Dэavid did more than Захари. So, we can write:
D = Z + 19 (since D did more than Z)
Now, we also know that John did fewer than David. So, we can write:
J < D
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
J < D = Z + 19
Simplifying and solving for J, we find that J = 26.
So, David made 39 - 26 = 13 more than Zachary. Therefore, David made 13 addjams."
Response:  We know that D...
"Response:  We know that Dэavid did more than Захарий and John did less than David. So, we can write an inequality based on this information:

David did x + 9 = 39 (since he did 39 - 9 = 30 more than Захарий)

John did y = 9 (since he did 9 fewer than David)

Now we want to find out how many more or less Захарий did than John. So, we set up another inequality using these two inequalities:

x + y =?

We are looking for the value of x and y that satisfies both inequalities. Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 24
y = 9

So, Захарий did 24 - 9 = 15 more than John. Therefore, the answer is 15."
Response:  We know that Dэavid did more than Zacari at school today. So, if Dэavid made 37 push-ups, then Zacari made x push-ups. Since we are given that Dэavid did more than Zacari, we can say that x < 37. Therefore, the number of push-ups Zacari made is 36 or less.
Response:  We know that Dэavid did more than Zakari at school today. So, if David made 56 push-ups and Zakari made x, then we can write an equation: 56 = David + Zakari. Now, we are told that David made 38 push-ups, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 56 = David + (x - 38). Now we need to find out how many push-ups Zakari made. Since David made 38 push-ups, we can subtract that from the total number of push-ups to find out how many push-ups Zakari made: 18 = (x - 38). Now we can solve for x: x = 40. Therefore, Zakari made 40 push-ups.
Response:  We know that DAVID did more than ZACHARI on the exercise bike. So, if Zachari did x number of pedal strokes and David did 40 + x = 57, then we can say that David did 57 - x pedal strokes. Now, we are told that David did fewer pedal strokes than Zachari on the exercise bike. Therefore, the difference between the number of pedal strokes done by David and Zachari is equal to the number of pedal strokes done by Zachari minus the number of pedal strokes done by David. So, the answer is 62 (the number of pedal strokes done by Zachari) minus 57 (the number of pedal strokes done by David). Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We know that David did more than Zachari on the number of push-ups (36 vs 33). However, we also know that Zachari did more sit-ups than David (58 vs 33). So, to find out how many more push-ups Zachari did than David, we need to subtract the number of sit-ups from the total number of exercises done by both students:

Zachari did 58 + 33 = 91 exercises in total.
David did 36 + 33 = 69 exercises in total.
Therefore, Zachari did 22 more push-ups than David (91 - 69 = 22)."
Response:  We know that David did more push-ups than Zachary (27 vs 17). However, we also know that Zachary did more crunches than David (7 vs 0). So, if we subtract the number of crunches from the total number of push-ups, we can find out how many push-ups Zachary did. Therefore, the answer is 17 - 7 = 10 push-ups.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading. So, in total, she had to do 7 pages (5 + 2). Now, we are told that she completed more math homework than reading tasks. Therefore, the number of math pages she completed is greater than the number of reading pages she completed. In other words, the difference between the number of math pages and reading pages is positive. So, the answer is 7 - 2 = 5.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of mathematical homework and 4 pages of reading. We can assume that each page has a fixed number of lines or paragraphs, so we can calculate the total number of lines/paragraphs for both tasks. For mathematical homework, there are 3 pages with 10-20 lines per page (assuming an average of 15 lines per page), giving us a total of 3 x 15 = 45 lines. For reading, there are 4 pages with an unknown number of lines/paragraphs per page (since it is not specified). So, the total number of lines/paragraphs for reading is 4 x? =? lines/paragraphs. Therefore, the difference between the number of lines/paragraphs for reading and mathematics is:? - 45 =? lines/paragraphs.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and several additional pages of reading. If she was supposed to do 7 pages of homework in total, then she must have done 2 pages (5 - 2 =) of reading. Therefore, Rachel had to read 2 pages of text.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and she completed 4 pages more than she read. So, if she read x pages, then she completed 7 - 4 = 3 pages of math homework. Therefore, the answer is 3 pages.
Response:  If Rachel needed to complete 8 pages of math homework and she had to do 3 more pages than reading, then...
"Response:  If Rachel needed to complete 8 pages of math homework and she was asked to do an additional 6 pages of reading comprehension homework, then the total number of pages she needs to complete is:
8 + 6 = 14 pages
Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 14 pages of homework in total."
Response:  Rachel needed to complete 10 pages of math homework. If she had to read 3 more pages than she did in math, then she needed to complete 13 pages in total (10 + 3).
Response:  Racheal needs to do 2 pages of math homework, which means she has to solve 4 problems (since each page usually contains 2 problems). Then, she needs to read 3 pages, which means she has to read 9 texts (again, since each page usually contains 3 texts). Finally, she needs to complete 10 biology homework tasks, which means she has to write down answers for 10 questions or draw diagrams and explain concepts related to biology. Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to complete 4 + 9 + 10 = 23 pages of homework.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel has already completed 2 pages of reading and 9 pages of math homework, leaving her with 7 pages of math homework remaining (since there are 10 pages in total). Therefore, she has more math homework left than reading homework left. So, the difference between the number of math pages left and the number of reading pages left is 7 - 2 = 5 pages.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel has already completed 7 pages of math homework and 5 pages of biology homework. This means she still needs to complete 4 pages of math homework (11 - 7 = 4) and 8 pages of biology homework (2 + 3 = 8). So, there are more math tasks left for her than biology tasks. The difference between these two numbers is 4 - 8 = -4. Therefore, Rachel has -4 more pages of biology homework than math homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading, and 8 pages of biology homework. So, in total she had to do 7 + 11 = 18 pages of work. Now we know that there are more pages of reading than biology, so let's say there are x pages of reading and y pages of biology. Since there are more pages of reading, x must be greater than y. Therefore, the number of pages of reading is greater than 8, but less than or equal to 18 (since it has to be an integer). So, the answer is between 9 and 17 inclusive.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel needs to complete 9 pages of mathematical tasks and 11 pages of reading comprehension. Therefore, she needs to complete 9 + 11 = 20 pages in total.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of mathematical tasks and 3 pages of biological tasks. Since each page has 20 problems, we can calculate that she needs to solve 160 mathematical problems (8 pages x 20 problems/page) and 60 biological problems (3 pages x 20 problems/page). Therefore, the total number of problems Rachel needs to solve is 220 (160 + 60).
Response:  According to the question, Rachel needs to complete 5 pages of mathematical tasks, which means she has 5 x 4 = 20 problems to solve. Then, she needs to do 10 pages of reading, which is equal to 10 x 4 = 40 sentences or paragraphs. Finally, she needs to finish 6 pages of biology assignments, which is equal to 6 x 4 = 24 problems or questions. Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to complete 20 + 40 + 24 = 84 pages of work.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 2 pages of home reading and 4 pages of homework in mathematics. We know that she completed more pages of homework than pages of reading. So, let's say she completed x pages of homework and y pages of reading, where x > y. Now we can find out how many more pages of homework Rachel had to do than pages of reading by subtracting y from x: x - y = 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 2 more pages of homework than pages of reading.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 4 pages of home reading, 7 pages of math homework, and 19 pages of biology homework. So, in total she had to complete 4 + 7 + 19 = 30 pages of work. Since we are asked how many more pages of math homework Rachel had than pages of reading, we can subtract the number of pages of reading from the total number of pages of work: 30 - 4 = 26 pages. Therefore, there were 26 more pages of math homework than pages of reading for Rachel.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in total. So, he received x emails more at night than he did in the morning. Since he received 2 emails at night, we can set up the equation: x = 2 - 6 = -4. Therefore, Jack received 4 more emails at night than he did in the morning.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 6 Emails Evening = 8 Emails Now, let's subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the evening to find out how many more emails he received in the evening than in the morning: Evening - Morning = 8 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 electronic letters in the morning and several more letters in the second half of the day. So, if he received a total of 5 letters that day, then he must have received 3 letters in the second half of the day (since 4 + x = 5, where x is the number of letters he received in the second half of the day).
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails during the day, and 5 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation: Total = Morning + Day + Evening. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14. Therefore, Jack received 14 emails that day.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack received 5 letters in the morning and 8 letters in the evening. So, he received a total of 13 letters (5 + 8). Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 5 letters during the day and 8 letters in the evening. So, he received a total of 13 letters (5 + 8).
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 electronic letters in the morning and 8 electronic letters in the evening. So, he received a total of 11 electronic letters (3 + 8 = 11).
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 10 + 7 = 17 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails at night than in the morning.
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 10 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 19 emails. Now, we need to find out how many emails Jack received more in the evening than he did in the morning. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the evening: 10 - 9 = 1. So, Jack received 1 email more in the evening than he did in the morning.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 5 emails during the day, and 4 emails in the evening. So, we can write down an equation: Morning + Day = Evening (Total Emails). Now, let's solve for ""Day"": Day = Total Emails - Evening Emails (Since Jack received more emails in the morning than during the day) Day = 10 + 5 = 15 Emails Therefore, Jack received 15 emails more during the day than he did in the evening."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails during the day, and several more in the evening. So, he received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails during the day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 electronic letters and 64 regular letters, so he received in total 67 letters (3 + 64 = 67). Then, in the evening, he received 5 electronic letters and 54 regular letters, so he received in total 121 letters (5 + 54 = 121) for the day. Therefore, Jack received 121 letters during the day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 electronic letters and 6 handwritten letters, so he received in total 11 letters (5 + 6 = 11). Then, in the second half of the day, he received 9 electronic letters and 7 handwritten letters, so he received in total 16 letters (9 + 7 = 16) for the whole day. Therefore, Jack received a total of 11 + 16 = 27 letters during the day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 electronic letters in the morning and 3 more afterward. So he got a total of 10 + 3 = 13 electronic letters in the morning. In the second half of the day, he received 44 letters. Therefore, we can conclude that Jack received more electronic letters in the morning than in the second half of the day (13 - 44 = -31).
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 electronic letters and 8 handwritten letters in the morning. Then he received 2 electronic letters and 7 handwritten letters in the afternoon. So, we can write down the total number of letters Jack received as follows: Morning: 6 + 8 = 14 Afternoon: 2 + 7 = 9 Total number of letters Jack received = 14 + 9 = 23 Therefore, Jack received more letters in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 electronic letters and sent out 91 letters in the morning. So, he received 91 - 6 = 85 letters in total in the morning. Then, he received 2 more letters in the evening and sent out 74 letters. Therefore, Jack received 85 + 2 = 87 letters in total for the day.
"Response: 
Jeff received 4 electronic letters and sent 2 letters in the morning. So he got 4 + 2 = 6 letters in total in the morning.
Then he received 6 letters and sent 8 letters in the evening. So he got 6 + 8 = 14 letters in total in one day.
Therefore, Jeff sent 8 letters in one day."
Response:  We know that Jack received 7 emails in the morning and then some more in the afternoon. So, let's assume he received x emails in the second half of the day. Since he received a total of 9 emails, we can write an equation: 7 + x = 9. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 additional emails in the second half of the day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 letters in the second half of the day, 5 letters in the morning and 16 letters in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of letters received in the second half = 3 Number of letters received in the morning = 5 Total number of letters received = Number of letters received in the second half + Number of letters received in the morning We are given that the total number of letters received is 28 (16 + 5 + 3). Therefore, we can solve for the number of letters received in the second half as follows: Number of letters received in the second half = 28 - 5 = 23 Now, we know that Jack received more letters in the second half than he did in the morning, so we can say that 23 > 5. Therefore, Jack received 18 letters more in the second half than he did in the morning.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack received 3 letters in the second half of the day and 6 letters in the morning, for a total of 9 letters. So, if he received 10 letters in all, then he must have received 1 letter in the evening (after 6 PM).
Response:  We know that sa...
"Response:  The sum of their jumps is equal to the total distance they jumped together. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Sa + L = Total Distance

We know that Sa (саранча) jumped 31 dp and La (лягушка) jumped 35 dp. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

31 + 35 = Total Distance

Solving for Total Distance, we find that it is equal to 66 dp. Therefore, the answer is 66."
Response:  We know that the soaring falcon (сорокопут) jumped 36 inches, and then we are told that the frog (лягушка) jumped farther than the falcon. So, the distance traveled by the frog is greater than 36 inches. Then, we are given another piece of information that the mouse (мышь) jumped farther than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is greater than the distance traveled by the frog. Finally, we are asked how far the frog jumped. To solve this problem, we can use the following equation: Distance = Speed x Time. Since we don't have any information about the speed of the frog or mouse, let's assume they both moved at a constant speed throughout their jumps. Now, we need to find out how long each animal took to make its jump. The question states that the falcon jumped 36 d
"Response:  We know that:
Soрока punched 25 dunaym (dummy).
Лягушка punched 18 dunaym more than сорока (so 33 dunaym).
Мышь punched 2 dunaym more than лягушка (so 35 dunaym).
Now we can calculate how many dunaym мышь jumped:
35 - 2 = 33 dunaym."
"Response:  We know that:
Soрока pried 19 düyum. (19 cm)
Лягушка pried 10 düyum daçi sooroki. (10 cm + 19 cm = 39 cm)
Мышь pried 20 düyum daçi lüguši. (20 cm + 39 cm = 59 cm)
Now we can see that the distance between the starting point of each animal and the finish line is equal to their jumping height plus half of the distance they traveled before reaching the finish line. So, for our calculation, we need to find out how far each animal traveled before reaching the finish line.
For Сорока (Sparrow), the distance traveled before reaching the finish line is:
Distance = Start Point - Finish Line = 19 cm - 0 cm = 19 cm
For Lягушка (Frog), the distance traveled before reaching the finish line is:
Distance = Start Point - Finish Line = 10 cm - 19 cm = -9 cm
For Мышь (Mouse), the distance traveled before reaching the finish line is:
Distance = Start Point - Finish Line = 20 cm - 19 cm = 1 cm
Now we can calculate the distance each animal jumped:
For Сорока (Sparrow): Distance Jumped = Height + Half Distance Traveled = 19 cm + (19 cm / 2) = 19 cm + 9.5 cm = 28.5 cm
For Lягушка (Frog): Distance Jumped = Height + Half Distance Traveled = 10 cm + (10 cm / 2) = 10 cm + 5 cm = 15 cm
For Мышь (Mouse): Distance Jumped = Height + Half Distance Traveled = 20 cm + (20 cm / 2) = 20 cm + 10 cm = 30 cm
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Мышь прыгнула дальше, чем Сорока на 10.5 cm ("
"Response:  We know that the soaring bird (soar-cock) jumped 19 inches, and the frog (leap-frog) jumped x inches more than the bird. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
x = 19 + 39 = 58
So, the frog jumped 58 inches more than the bird. And since the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog, we can say that the mouse jumped 94 - 58 = 36 inches."
"Response:  We know that:
Soрока punched 25 dunaym (dummy).
Лягушка punched 32 dunaym more than сорока (so 32 + 25 = 57).
Мышь punched 26 dunaym less than лягушка (so 57 - 26 = 31).
Therefore, мышь punched 31 dunayms."
"Response:  We know that:
Soрокопут punched 24 dюйма (1 foot).
Лягушка punched 33 dюйма (1 foot and 3 inches) further than Soрокопут.
Мышь punched 5 dюйма (0 feet and 6 inches) less than Lяguška.
From this information, we can calculate how far Мышь jumped:
Мышь jumped = Lягушка - 5 dюйма = 38 dюйма (1 foot and 3 inches)
Therefore, Мышь jumped 38 dюйма (1 foot and 3 inches) farther than Сорокопут."
Response:  So, if Soroka jumped 13 inches and Lizard jumped 2 inches more than Soroka, then Lizard jumped 15 inches (13 + 2 = 15). Therefore, Lizard jumped 15 inches.
Response:  We know that sa...
"Response:  We know that lizard jumped from height of 10 meters. So, we need to calculate how many times it can jump if it has a speed of 2 meters per second. To do this, we will use the formula: distance = speed x time. In this case, the distance is equal to the height from which the lizard jumped (10 meters). If the lizard jumps at a speed of 2 meters per second, then the time it takes for the lizard to cover this distance is also known as the time of flight. This time is calculated using the formula: time of flight = distance / speed. Substituting the values given in the problem into these formulas, we get: Distance = 10 meters Time of Flight = 10 meters / 2 meters/second = 5 seconds Now, since the lizard jumped from the ground and landed safely on the other side, we know that its acceleration during the jump was zero. Therefore, the maximum height reached by the lizard during the jump is equal to half of its initial height, or 5 meters in this case. Thus, the answer to the question ""How much did the frog jump?"" is 5 meters."
Response:  We know that Sochka (the rook) jumped 39 inches and Lishka (the frog) jumped 19 inches more than Sochka. Therefore, Lishka jumped 39 + 19 = 58 inches. Now we are told that Myshka (the mouse) jumped 12 inches less than Lishka. Therefore, Myshka jumped 58 - 12 = 46 inches.
"Response:  The distance traveled by the flea is given as ""30 times longer"" than the distance traveled by the mouse. So if the mouse travels x meters in one jump, then the flea will travel 30x meters in one jump. Therefore, the answer to the question is 30x meters."
Response:  We know that lizard jumped 5 times its own length and then landed at a distance of 20 meters from the starting point. So, if we calculate the length of the lizard, it will be: Length = Distance / Number of jumps = 20 m / 5 jumps = 4 m. Therefore, the lizard jumped 4 meters further than the snail.
"Response:  We know that:
Soрока (Sparrow) jumped 9 inches.
Мышь (Mouse) jumped x inches less than Lягушка (Frog).
Лягушка (Frog) jumped 33 inches more than Сорока (Sparrow).
From the third statement, we can write:
Lягушка = Сорока + 33
Substituting the value of Soрока from the first statement, we get:
Lягушка = 9 + 33 = 42
Therefore, мышь (Mouse) jumped 42 - 3 = 39 inches."
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the mouse is 3 times the distance traveled by the hamster. So if the hamster traveled 10 meters, then the mouse traveled 3 x 10 = 30 meters. Therefore, the mouse priedgnulated farther than the cupnzerchicker - 30 meters vs 10 meters.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to the recipe and she needs to add another 9 cups (since the original recipe calls for 14 cups in total). So, Mary needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour. As for sugar, since the recipe originally called for 6 cups and Mary has already used 3 cups, she needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar. Therefore, the final amounts needed are: Flour - 9 cups; Sugar - 3 cups."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to her mixture and she needs to add 7 more (since there are 9 cups of flour in total). So, she needs to add 3 more cups of flour. As for sugar, we know that there are 11 cups of sugar in total and Mary has already added 4 cups, so she needs to add 7 more cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to the recipe and now she needs to add more. If she needs to add 8 cups of flour more than the amount of sugar in the recipe, we can calculate it as follows:

Sugar in the recipe = 13 cups
Flour needed = 8 cups (more than sugar)

So, Mary needs to add 8 - 13 = -5 cups of flour. Since this is a negative number, we need to subtract 5 cups of flour from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 - 5 = 1 cup of flour to the recipe."
Response:  According to the recipe, for every 1 cup of flour, there are 7 cups of sugar. So if Mary has already added some flour and still needs 2 more cups than she has sugar, then... (11 - 7 = 4)...she must have added 4 cups of flour.
Response:  The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and some additional flour. Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 6 more cups. Therefore, the total amount of flour required in the recipe is 9 cups (11 - 3 + 6).
Response:  According to the recipe, Mary needs 12 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. If she has already added some flour, then she still needs 9 cups of flour (12 - 2 = 9). So, Mary has already added 2 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can subtract these amounts from the total amount required in the recipe (9 cups + 5 cups = 14 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 14 - 3 = 11 cups of flour.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. So, the number of additional cups of sugar needed is:
Total amount of sugar required - Amount already added = 14 cups - 12 cups = 2 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 2 cups of sugar to her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to the mixture and according to the recipe, she needs to add 6 more cups (12 - 11 = 6). So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour to the mixture and she needs to add another 3 cups (since the recipe calls for 10 cups in total). So, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour.
Now, let's calculate how much sugar is needed. The recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, so Mary needs to add 2 - 2 = 0 cups of sugar since she has already added 2 cups.
Finally, we need to calculate how many cups of salt are left to be added. Since the recipe calls for 80 cups of salt and Mary has already added 75 cups (7 x 10 = 70 + 5), then Mary needs to add 5 more cups of salt (80 - 75 = 5).
So, the final amounts of ingredients that Mary needs to add are:
Flour: 3 cups
Sugar: 0 cups
Salt: 5 cups"
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the mixture and she needs to add another 6 cups (since the recipe calls for 8 total). To find out how much salt she needs to add, we can use the same ratio as before - 1 cup of salt for every 3 cups of flour. So, if Mary adds 6 more cups of flour, she will also need to add 2 cups of salt (since there are 3 cups of flour in each cup of salt). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 2 cups of salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to the mixture and according to the recipe, she needs to add 1 cup more of flour. So, we need to subtract 1 cup from 6 cups (the total amount of flour needed) to get the remaining amount of flour needed. Now, let's find out how much sugar and salt are left in the recipe after adding 5 cups of flour. The ratio of sugar to salt is 8:7, so if there were initially 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt, then after adding 5 cups of flour, there will be 3 cups of sugar and 4 cups of salt left. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of sugar more than salt to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar to the mixture and according to the recipe, she needs to add 11 more cups (13 - 2 = 11). So, she needs to add an additional 11 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and needs to add 2 more (since she has 6 total). Now, we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, so we need to subtract the amount of sugar Mary has already added from the total number of cups of flour needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the recipe and she needs to add another 3 cups (since the recipe calls for 6 - 2 = 4 cups). So, she needs to add 3 more cups of flour. As for sugar, since she has already used 2 cups, she only needs to use an additional 7 cups (since the recipe calls for 9 - 2 = 7 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to the mixture and according to the recipe, she needs to add 4 more cups (5 - 11 = 4). So, she needs to add 4 more cups of flour. As for sugar, we are told that there are 5 cups in total in the recipe, and since Mary has already added 3 cups (11 / 5 = 3), she needs to add only 2 more cups (5 - 3 = 2) of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to the recipe and now she needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. So, if she has 3 cups of sugar, then she needs 8 cups of flour (5 - 3 = 8). Therefore, Mary has added 8 cups of flour to the recipe.
Response:  According to the recipe, Mary needs 12 cups of flour for the cake. She has already added some flour, but she still doesn't have enough. So, if she needs 12 cups and she has already added x cups, then we can write an equation as follows: 12 = x +? (where? represents the number of additional cups of flour needed). Now, let's solve this equation. We know that x is the number of cups of flour Mary has already added, so we can substitute x in the equation: 12 = x +?. Substituting x with 4 (since Mary has already added 4 cups of flour), we get: 12 = 4 +?. Solving for?, we find that Mary needs to add 8 more cups of flour:? = 8. Therefore, Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, and she needs to add 8 more cups to make the total amount equal to 12 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. So, if the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and Mary has already added 7 cups, then she needs to add an additional 7 - 7 = 0 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary does not need to add any more flour. Similarly, since Mary has already added 60 cups of sugar, there is no need to add any more sugar either.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe (11 cups). So, Mary needs to add 1 cup of sugar more.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour to the mixture and the recipe calls for 10 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour (10 - 6 = 4) by the number of additional cups she wants to add (1). Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to the mixture and according to the recipe, there are 14 cups of flour needed. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add to reach the total amount of flour required in the recipe. To do this, we can divide the number of cups of flour required (14) by the number of cups of flour Mary has already added (4): 14 / 4 = 3.5. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3.5 cups of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the mixture and she needs to add another 3 cups (since the recipe calls for 6 cups in total). So, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour. As for salt, since the recipe calls for 4 cups and Mary has already added 1 cup, she needs to add an additional 3 cups of salt. Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour and 3 cups of salt to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to the recipe and is now looking for how much more sugar she needs to add than salt. So far, we have:

* Sugar: 11 cups + (12 - 6) = 13 cups
* Salt: 9 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 cups of sugar more than salt."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and needs to add more. To find out how many cups she needs to add, we can use the following formula: Total amount of sugar needed = Original amount of sugar - Amount already added. In this case, the original amount of sugar is 7 cups (as stated in the recipe), and Mary has already added 4 cups. So, the total amount of sugar she needs to add is: Total amount of sugar needed = 7 - 4 = 3 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar.
Response:  If Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and needs to add more, then she needs to add 2 cups of flour (since there are 12 cups of flour in total). So, the final amount of flour needed is 14 - 10 = 4 cups.
Response:  We know that there are 19 families of penguins living near the mountain and that 60% of them have migrated to warmer countries for winter. This means that 19 x 0.6 = 11.4 families of penguins have left. So, there are 19 - 11.4 = 8.6 families of penguins remaining near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 87 families of birds live near the mountain and 7 of them have migrated to warmer climates for winter. So, we are left with 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds who stayed behind.
Response:  We know that 20 families of penguins migrated to warmer climates for winter and only 14 families remained near the mountain. So, initially there were 14 + 20 = 34 families of penguins living near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 85 families of pigeons live near the mountain. If 23 families of pigeons went to Africa and 37 families of pigeons went to Asia, then we have:
Number of families of pigeons left in the area = 85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25 families."
"Response:  We know that 42 families of penguins went to Africa and 31 families went to Asia. So, we have:
42 + 31 = 73
Therefore, more families of penguins migrated to Africa than to Asia."
"Response:  We know that 47 families of penguins went to Africa and 94 families went to Asia. So, we have:
47 + 94 = 141
Therefore, more families of penguins went to Asia than those who went to Africa."
"Response:  We know that:
* 18 families of penguins live near the mountain.
* If 38 families of penguins went to Africa and 80 families went to Asia for wintering, then the total number of families that left is 38 + 80 = 118.
Therefore, the number of families of penguins that stayed in their native land (near the mountain) is 18 - 118 = -100."
"Response:  We know that ""лето"" (summer) is approaching and most animals are migrating back to their colder countries of origin. This means that there will be more birds around the mountain than usual during this time of year. The original text states that there are already 87 families of p..."
Response:  We know that 59 families of penguins have left for their wintering grounds and 24 new families of penguins have arrived from the Arctic. So, the total number of families of penguins remaining near the mountain is: 49 - 59 + 24 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 families of penguins remaining near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds migrated away from the mountain and only 41 families remained nearby. So, there are 41 - 27 = 14 families of birds left near the mountain after migration.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain. If 86 families migrated to warmer countries for winter, then the number of families remaining nearby the mountain is:

Number of families remaining = 45 - 86 = 41

Therefore, 41 families of birds remained near the mountain after 86 families migrated to warmer countries for winter."
"Response:  We know that 35 families of birds migrated to Asia and 62 families migrated to Africa. So, we have:

35 + 62 = 97

Therefore, more families of birds migrated to Africa than those who migrated to Asia."
"Response:  We know that:
1. The number of families of penguins who migrated to warmer countries is 26 (from Arctic).
2. The number of families of penguins who stayed near the mountain is 3 (initially there were 3 families).
3. The number of families of penguins who left for southern wintering grounds is 2 (initially there were 2 families).
So, the final number of families of penguins remaining near the mountain is:
3 + 26 - 2 = 36 families of penguins remain near the mountain."
Response:  We know that Pol received 253 pencils and lost or gave away 70 of them during the school year. So, he has 183 pencils left at the end of the school year (253 - 70 = 183).
Response:  We know that Pol received x number of pencils as a gift on his birthday. By the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 pencils, leaving him with 177. So, we can set up an equation: x - 551 = 177. Now, let's solve for x: x = 728. Therefore, Pol received 728 pencils as a gift on his birthday.
Response:  We know that Pol received 440 pencils as a gift and gave away 111 of them to his friends during the school year. This means he has 329 pencils left (440 - 111 = 329). Then we are told that he lost 106 pencils, so he has 223 pencils left (329 - 106 = 223). Therefore, Pol has 223 pencils left.
Response:  We know that Pol received 65 kandandaish per day and gave away or lost some during the year. So, let X be the number of kandandaish he had at the end of the year. Since he gave away 213 candandaish to his friends, we can write an equation as follows: X - 213 = 65X + 16 (1) Now, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract 213 from both sides of the equation: X - 213 = 65X + 16 Subtracting 213 from both sides gives us: X = 408 (2) Therefore, Pol had 408 kandandaish left at the end of the year after giving away or losing some.
Response:  We know that Pol received 589 pencils as a gift and gave away 571 of them to his friends during the school year. This means he has 18 pencils left (589 - 571 = 18). Now we are asked how many more pencils he gave away than he lost. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of pencils he lost from the number of pencils he gave away. So, the difference is: 18 (number of pencils left) - 161 (number of pencils lost) = 143 (more pencils given away than lost). Therefore, Pol gave away 143 more pencils than he lost during the school year.
Response:  We know that Pol received 110 kandandaish per day and gave away 90 to his friends during the academic year. So he has 210 (110-90) left with him. Now we are told that he lost 412 candandaish. Therefore, the number of candandaish he lost is equal to the number he gave away plus the number he had initially. So the answer is: 412 = 90 + 210. Therefore, he lost 320 candandaish more than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Pol received x number of crayons as gift on his birthday. During the school year, he gave away 563 crayons to his friends and lost 558 crayons. So, the total number of crayons he had at the end of the school year is: 332 - 558 = -226. Now, we need to find out how many crayons Pol received on his birthday. Since it was a positive number (x), we can subtract it from the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year: 332 - x = 226. Solving for x, we get: x = 104. Therefore, Pol received 104 crayons on his birthday.
Response:  We know that Pol received 52 carandashes from his friends and lost or gave away 535 of them during the school year. So, he has 492 carandashes left. To find out how many carandashes were lost or given away, we can subtract the number of carandashes he received from the total number of carandashes he had at first: 535 - 52 = 483. Therefore, 483 carandashes were lost or given away.
Response:  We know that at first, Pol had 521 koh-i-noors and 66 laces. Then he lost some or gave away some during the year. At the end of the year, he had 154 left. So, we can write an equation: 521 + 66 = x, where x is the number of koh-i-noors Pol had at the end of the year. Now, let's solve for x: 521 + 66 = 154 (Subtracting 66 from both sides) 455 = 154 (Dividing both sides by 2) 227 = 77 (Dividing both sides by 3) Therefore, Pol lost or gave away 77 koh-i-noors during the year.
Response:  At first, Pol had 531 kandandas and 38 lamesticks. After he used them for some time, he had 391 candles left. So, we can write an equation: 531 - 38 = x, where x is the number of candles Pol has now. Now, let's solve this equation: 493 = x. Therefore, Pol has 493 candles left. As for the lamesticks, Pol didn't lose any of them, so he still has 38 lamesticks.
Response:  At first, Pol had 601 pencils and 406 erasers. So he had in total 1007 items (601 + 406). Then, during the school year, he lost some of them, but not any pencils or erasers. Therefore, at the end of the school year, he had 336 more erasers than pencils. That means that he has 336 - 601 = -265 pencils left. However, we were asked whether he has more erasers than pencils, so let's check if -265 is greater than 406. It is indeed! So, Pol has more erasers than pencils.
"Response:  We know that Pol received x number of pencils as gift on his birthday and he had 315 pencils at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, he has 291 pencils left. So we can write an equation:
x + 315 = 291
Now let's solve for x:
x = 315 - 291
x = 24
Therefore, Pol received 24 pencils as gift on his birthday."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Pol received 267 kandandaish in his gift box and lost 231 during the academic year. So he has 36 (267 - 231) remaining candandaish.
Now, he gave away 308 candandaish to his friends. To find out how many more he gave away than he lost, subtract the number of candandaish he gave away from the number he had left:
308 - 36 = 272
So, Pol gave away 272 more candandaish than he lost during the academic year."
Response:  At first, Pol had 457 laces and 320 pencils. After using them during the year, he had 523 items left (not losing any). So, we can write an equation: 457 + 320 = 523. Now, let's solve for the number of pencils he had at the end of the year: 320 - 457 = -137. Therefore, there were 137 more pencils than laces at the end of the year. Answer: 137
Response:  At first, the officer served 11 clients. After that, some of them left, and now there are only 3 clients remaining. So, we need to find out how many clients left more than remained. To do this, let's divide the number of clients who left (11) by the number of clients remaining (3): 11 / 3 = 3.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a client, the answer is 4 clients left more than remained.
Response:  At first, the official served 3 clients. After that, some of them left, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that x clients left. Now, the official has 4 clients left. We want to find out how many clients remained more than those who left. In other words, we need to find out how many clients are left after subtracting the number of clients who left from the total number of clients initially served (3 + x). Therefore, the answer is 4 - x.
Response:  At first, the official had some clients (let's call it x). After that, 9 of them left, so he had 12 - 9 = 3 clients left. Therefore, in the beginning, the official had x = 12 clients.
Response:  At first, the officer served 14 clients. Then, 5 of them left, so we have: Number of clients = 14 - 5 = 9 clients. Therefore, there are 9 clients remaining for the officer to serve.
Response:  The official served 13 clients initially and then lost some of them to leave 9 clients remaining. So, we need to find out how many clients left. If he served 4 new clients after losing some old ones, that means there were originally 9 + 4 = 13 clients in total. Therefore, 5 clients (i.e., 9 - 4) left.
Response:  At first, the official served 12 clients. Then, 15 clients left, and 14 new clients arrived. So, the total number of clients he had at that moment was: 12 + (15 - 14) = 12 + 1 = 13 clients. Therefore, the official has 13 clients remaining.
Response:  The official served 3 clients initially and then had 8 clients after some new clients arrived. So, the number of new clients that arrived is 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, the officer served 8 clients and then some left, leaving him with 5 clients remaining. Then, he received 99 new clients. So, in total, he had 104 clients (including both old and new ones). Therefore, the number of clients that left is 6 (104 - 5 = 6).
Response:  At first, the official served 12 clients and then some left, so he had 14 clients remaining. Then, 10 new clients arrived, bringing the total number of clients to 24 (14 + 10). Therefore, there are currently 24 clients being serviced by the official.
Response:  Dan had $X dollars initially. After buying a chocolate bar for $2, he has $X - $2 = $X - $2 left. Since he has $3 left after buying the chocolate bar, we can set up the equation X - $2 = $3. Solving for X, we get X = $5. So, Dan had $5 dollars initially.
Response:  Danny has $4 initially and spends $1 on chocolate. So he has $3 left ($4 - $1 = $3). The cost of the chocolate is $1.
Response:  Danny spent $3 x 99 = $297 on chocolate bars. So he has $4 - $297 = $-293 left.
Response:  We know that Danny has $3 and he bought 2 chocolates for $8 each. So, in total, he spent $8 + $8 = $16. Therefore, each chocolate costs half of the amount he spent, i.e., $\frac{16}{2} = 8$.
Response:  Dan has $2 and he bought several chocolate bars for $6 each. So, in total, he spent $6 + $6 +... = n \* $6, where n is the number of chocolate bars he bought. Since each bar costs $3, we can write: $$n = \frac{2}{3}$$ Now, let's substitute this value into the equation above: $$n = \frac{2}{3} = 2$$ Therefore, Dan bought 2 chocolate bars.
Response:  Danny spent $2 for chocolate and $3 for another chocolate, so he spent a total of $5. He had $7 to start with, minus the amount he spent ($5), equals $2. So, there are $2 left.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he spent $7 on chocolate and $6 on another chocolate. So, in total, he spent $7 + $6 = $13.
Response:  Danny spent $6 for chocolate and $3 for candy, so he spent a total of $9. Since he had only $2 to start with, he spent more money on candy than on chocolate. Therefore, the answer is $7 ($9 - $2).
Response:  Dan spent $3 + $2 = $5 on chocolates. So he spent $5 / $5 = 1 dollar on both chocolates combined. Therefore, he spent more money on the first chocolate than on the second one.
Response:  Danny has $4 initially. He buys a chocolate bar for $8, so he now has $4 - $8 = $-4. Then his friend gives him $5, so he now has $4 + $5 = $9. Therefore, there are $9 - $4 = $5 dollars left with Danny.
Response:  At first, Danny had $4. After buying a chocolate bar, he was left with $3. So, the cost of one chocolate bar is $3 - $4 = $-1.
Response:  Dan has $4 and spent $3 on chocolate bars. So he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.
Response:  We know that Danny has $3 and spent $4 in total. So he spent $4 - $3 = $1 more than he had. Therefore, each chocolate bar cost $1.
Response:  Dan spent $3 + $7 = $10 on chocolates. So he spent $10 / $5 = $2 on each chocolate.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he spent $7 for one chocolate bar and $2 for another chocolate bar. So, in total, he spent $7 + $2 = $9 on buying both chocolate bars. Therefore, he spent $9 / 2 = $4.50 on each chocolate bar.
Response:  At first, Pol had 115 books. Then he sold 78 books at the garage sale. So, how many books does he have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he initially had: 115 - 78 = 37. Therefore, Pol has 37 books left.
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books at a garage sale, Paul had 105 left. So, if he started with some number of books (let's call it x), then we can set up the equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 268
So, Paul initially had 268 books."
"Response:  We know that initially Pol had 108 books and after selling some of them at a garage sale he had 62 books left. So, we can write an equation:

108 - X = 62
Where X is the number of books sold at the garage sale.
Solving for X, we get:
X = 46
So, Pol sold 46 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that after the garage sale, Pol had 151 books left. So, he must have bought some books at the garage sale. To find out how many books he bought, we can divide the number of books he has now (151) by the number of books he had before (50): 151 / 50 = 3. So, Pol bought 3 books at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, Pol had 2 books. Then he bought 150 new ones, so his total number of books became: 2 + 150 = 152. Now, if he has 58 books left, it means that he sold some of them. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he currently has from the total number of books he had at first: 152 - 58 = 94. So, Pol sold 94 books.
Response:  At first, Pol had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, so he bought 42 new ones. Now, he has 15 books left. To find out how many books he sold more than he bought, we need to subtract the number of books he bought (42) from the total number of books he had initially (21): 21 - 42 = -21. So, Pol sold 21 more books than he bought.
Response:  At first, Pol had 71 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, so he bought 38 new ones. Now, he has 116 books in total. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he has now: 116 - 38 = 78. So, Pol bought 78 more books than he sold.
Response:  At first, Pol had 108 books and 55 notebooks. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 notebooks left. So, he sold 42 books (108 - 66) and 7 notebooks (55 - 59).
Response:  We know that after selling some books and notebooks at the garage sale, Pol had 82 books and 14 notebooks left. To find out how many notebooks he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of notebooks he had before from the number of notebooks he has now: 106 - 14 = 92. So, Pol sold 92 notebooks at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 136 books and after selling some of them he was left with 27 books. So, we can write an equation: 136 - x = 27 where x is the number of books sold by Pol. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 136: x / 136 = 27 / 136. Simplifying, we get x = 9. Therefore, Pol sold 9 books at the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that after Pol sold some books at a garage sale, he had 68 books left. And before selling them, he had 134 books. So, we can write an equation:

134 - 39 = 68

Now, let's solve for the number of books Pol sold at the garage sale:

39 = 68 - x

Where x is the number of books Pol sold at the garage sale.

Substituting this equation into the first one, we get:

134 - 39 = 68 - x

Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Pol sold 25 books at the garage sale. Therefore, the answer is 25."
Response:  At first, Pol had 153 books and 95 folders. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 folders left. So, he sold 136 (153 - 13) books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 42 ru...
Response:  At first, there were 10 roses in the vase. Then Jessica cut 8 more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. So, now there are 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  We know that there were some roses in the vase initially (the number is x). Then Jessica added 16 more roses to the vase, so now there are x + 16 roses in the vase. Finally, she removed 16 roses from the vase, leaving us with x - 16 roses. Therefore, the initial number of roses in the vase was x = 7.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 2 roses in the vase and then Jessica added 4 more roses to it. So, the total number of roses in the vase after she added them is 2 + 4 = 6 roses. Now, we are told that she cut some new roses from her garden and put them in the vase too. This means that the total number of roses in the vase now is 6 + however many new roses she cut (which is not specified). Therefore, the final answer is 6 + x, where x is the number of new roses she cut. Since we don't have any information about how many new roses she cut, our answer must be ""x""."
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses in the vase and then Jessica added 33 more roses to it. So, the total number of roses in the vase after she added them is 15 + 33 = 48 roses. Now, we are told that she also cut some new roses from her garden to add to the vase, which means she removed some roses from the vase as well. The question asks how many roses she removed more than she threw away. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away (33) from the total number of roses in the vase after adding both the ones she found in the vase and those she cut from her garden (48 - 33 = 15). Therefore, Jessica removed 15 roses more than she threw away.
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 roses in the vase and then Jessica added 34 more from her garden. So, the total number of roses now is 21 + 34 = 55 roses. Then she cut some new roses from her garden to add them to the vase, which means she removed 15 roses from the vase. Therefore, the final number of roses left in the vase after all these actions are taken together is 55 - 15 = 40 roses. So, Jessica has more roses outside than inside the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 roses in the vase and then Jessica cut some more from her garden (which had only 59 roses). So, after she cut those additional roses, there were 7 + x roses in the vase, where x is the number of roses she cut from her garden. Now, we are told that there are 20 roses in the vase now. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 20. Solving for x, we get: x = 13. So, Jessica cut 13 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some more from her garden to add to it. So, let's assume she added x roses to the vase. Now, we are told that there are 21 roses in the vase altogether. Therefore, the number of roses left in the garden is equal to the total number of roses minus the number of roses in the vase. In other words, we can write: Number of roses remaining in the garden = Total number of roses - Number of roses in the vase Substituting the given values, we get: Number of roses remaining in the garden = 13 + x - 21 Number of roses remaining in the garden = 15 x = 10 Since there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica added 10 more from her garden, the total number of roses in the vase now is 13 + 10 = 23 roses.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. So, now there are 17 roses in total (including both initial ones and those she cut). And since we also know that there are still 96 orchids in the vase, we can conclude that Jessica cut 8 roses from her garden (since 17 - 15 = 8).
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, so now there are 10 roses in total (including both initial ones and new ones). However, we don't know how many orchids she cut from her garden and added to the vase. So, the number of orchids in the vase is still 2. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of orchids = 2.
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, so now there are 12 roses in total (including both initial ones and new ones). However, we don't know how many orchids she cut. So, the number of orchids remains unchanged - still 3. Therefore, the final number of roses is greater than the number of orchids - 12 vs 3.
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, so now there are 11 roses in total (including both the original ones and the new ones). However, we don't know how many orchids she cut from her garden and added to the vase. So, let's assume that she cut equal number of orchids as she did roses, i.e., 5 orchids. Therefore, the updated total number of orchids in the vase is 20 (initially there were 12 + 5 = 17 orchids). Now, we can see that the number of orchids is greater than the number of roses, so the answer is 20 - 11 = 9 more orchids than roses in the vase.
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses in the vase and Jessica added 16 more, then she must have cut 10 roses from her garden (since 16 - 3 = 13). So, Jessica cut 10 roses from her garden to add to the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. Now there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica cut as follows: Number of roses she cut = Total number of roses - Initial number of roses = 14 - 13 = 1 rose. Therefore, Jessica cut one rose from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. Now we have 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of orchids before she added new ones (3) from the current number of orchids (7). Therefore, Jessica cut 4 orchids.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, so now there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses there are compared to orchids, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the total number of flowers: 22 - 20 = 2 roses. So, there are 2 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, so now there are 13 roses in total (including both those in the vase and those she cut). However, we also know that Jessica did not cut any orchids from her garden. So, the number of orchids in the vase remains unchanged at 6. Therefore, the final number of orchids is greater than the number of roses by 6 - 3 = 3.
Response:  We know that Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long. If she cut off several inches of her hair, then it is now 13 inches long. To find out how many inches she cut off, we can subtract the new length from the original length: 17 - 13 = 4 inches. So, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.
Response:  Before cutting her hair, Robin had 20 inches of hair (d = 20). After cutting it, she has 10 inches left (d = 10). So, to find out how long her hair was before cutting, we can divide the original length by the remaining length: d = 20 / 10 = 2.
Response:  At first, Robin had hair that was 16 inches long (16 d). Then she cut it to 11 inches (11 d). After that, her hair grew back to 12 inches (12 d), which is the final length of her hair. So, the correct answer is 12 inches (12 d).
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long and then grew an additional 18 inches, its new length would be: 19 + 18 = 37 inches.
Response:  If Robin cut off 13 inches of her hair and it was originally 14 inches long, then... (1) The length of Robin's hair after cutting is 14 - 13 = 1 inch. So, the new length of Robin's hair is 1 inch.
"Response: 

Step 1: The length of Robin's hair was initially 14 inches (d = 14).

Step 2: Her hair grew by 8 inches (g = 8), so her new length became d + g = 14 + 8 = 22 inches.

Step 3: She cut off 20 inches from her hair (c = 20), leaving behind only 2 inches (d - c = 2).

Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 2 inches long (d = 2)."
Response:  Danny had 12 bottle caps before he found 53 in the park. So, his total number of bottle caps is now 12 + 53 = 65.
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 coasters in his collection and he found some more at the park. So, let's assume he found x coasters at the park. Now, we have a total of 21 + x coasters. Since Danny now has 53 coasters, it means that x = 32 (since 53 - 21 = 32). Therefore, Danny found 32 coasters at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 63 coasters in the park and then he threw away 51 old ones. So, now he has 33 coasters left in his collection. Therefore, initially, Danny had 63 - 51 = 12 coasters.
Response:  Danny collected 36 coasters from bottles and threw away 35 old ones, so he now has 22 coasters in his collection. To find out how many more coasters Danny found than he threw away, we need to subtract the number of coasters he threw away (35) from the total number of coasters he collected (36): 36 - 35 = 1. So, Danny found 1 more coaster than he threw away.
Response:  Danny found 30 coasters in the park and threw away 63 old ones, so he has 42 coasters now. To find out how many more coasters he threw away than he found, we need to subtract the number of coasters he found from the total number he threw away: 63 - 30 = 33. So, Danny threw away 33 more coasters than he found in the park.
Response:  Danny initially had 22 cocktail glasses and 8 paper clips in the park. Now he has 28 cocktail glasses and 63 paper clips in his collection. So, originally, Danny had 22 cocktail glasses.
Response:  At first, Danny had 30 oberek (original number). Then he found 22 more kryshky (caps) in the park, so now he has 30 + 22 = 52 oberek in total. Finally, he collected 17 more caps and 57 more wrappers, so his new collection consists of 52 oberek + 17 = 69 oberek and 57 wrappers. Therefore, originally Danny had 30 oberek.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 koppacks and 14 wrappers in the park. So initially he had 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection. Now we are told that he has 7 koppacks and 86 wrappers in his collection. Therefore, the number of koppacks he found in the park is 7 - 44 = -37. Since negative numbers cannot be used in mathematics, we can conclude that Danny found more wrappers than koppacks in the park. The difference between the number of wrappers and koppacks he found is 86 - 30 = 56. So Danny found 56 more wrappers than koppacks in the park.
Response:  Danny found 11 coasters and 28 caps in the park. So, he had 68 coasters + 28 caps = 96 items in his collection before going to the park. Now, he has 68 coasters + 51 caps = 120 items in his collection after finding more items in the park. Therefore, there are 120 - 96 = 24 more caps than coasters that Danny found in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny found 71 kryshkes and 24 capers in the park. Now he has 28 kryshkes and 16 capers in his collection. So initially, there were more kryshkes than capers (71-24=47). After collecting some more, now there are still more kryshkes than capers (28-16=12). Therefore, at present, there are 12 more kryshkes than capers in Danny's collection.
Response:  At first, Danny found 10 kryshkes and 62 wrappers in the park. So, he had 10 + 62 = 72 items in his collection initially. Now, he has added 27 more kryshkes and 43 more wrappers to his collection, so he has 72 + 27 = 99 kryshkes and 72 + 43 = 115 wrappers in total. Therefore, there are 115 wrappers more than kryshkes at Danny's current collection.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 cochineal in the park and now he has 25 left. So initially, Danny had 91 cochineal (91 - 66 = 25).
Response:  We know that Danny had 25 keg caps in his collection before he found some more in the park. So, if he found x additional keg caps in the park, then his new total is 25 + x. Since he now has 32 keg caps in his collection, we can set up the equation: 25 + x = 32. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. Therefore, Danny found 7 additional keg caps in the park.
Response:  Danny initially had 60 coasters (he threw away 60 old ones in the park). Then he found 58 new coasters, so his total number of coasters is now 60 + 58 = 118.
Response:  Danny threw away 6 old caps and found 50 new ones, so he has 50 - 6 = 44 new caps in total. Since he already had 6 old caps, his total collection of caps now is 44 + 6 = 50 caps. Therefore, Danny found more caps in the park than he threw away.
Response:  Danny collected 54 old caps and threw away 54 of them in the park, so he has 52 new caps now. He threw away more caps than he found in the park, so the difference between the number of caps he threw away and the number he found is equal to the total number of caps he has now (52). Therefore, the answer is 54 - 52 = 2.
Response:  Danny initially had 82 obrerktas and 29 kryshkes. He found 61 more obrerktas and 42 more kryshkes. So, in total, he has 82 + 61 = 143 obrerktas and 42 + 29 = 71 kryshkes.
Response:  Danny initially had 66 oblittles and collected 39 caps from bottles. Now he has 16 caps in his collection plus the original 66 oblittles, so the total number of oblittles he had at first is 66 + 16 = 82.

Based on the information provided, what is the number of kernels of corn in the bag?"
Response:  Danny found 65 obrerktk and 5 kryshkes at the park. Now he has 31 kryshkes and 9 obrertk in his collection. So, the number of obrertks he found at the park is 65 - 31 = 34 more than the number of kryshkes he found. Therefore, there are 34 more obrertks than kryshkes that Danny found at the park.
Response:  Danny had 58 kryshkes and 25 capskies in the park. He found 11 more capsules and 12 more kryshkes. So he has now 69 kryshkes and 37 capskies. There are more kryshkes than capskies, so there are 69 - 37 = 32 more kryshkes than capskies.
Response:  Danny found 15 kryshkes and 18 caperunks in the park. Now he has 67 obkerunks and 35 kyshkes in his collection. So, there are more obkerunks than kyshkes in Danny's collection now. The difference between the number of obkerunks and kyshkes is 67 - 35 = 32. Therefore, there are 32 more obkerunks than kyshkes in Danny's collection now.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen. So, if Jake has x per...
"Response:  We know that:
* Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen (7 vs 14)
* Steven has more percents than Jill (15 vs 14)
So we can conclude that:
Jake has 7 - 14 = -7 persimmons less than Stephen
Stephen has 15 + 7 = 22 persimmons more than Jill
Therefore, Jake has -7 persimmons."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen, and Stephen has more percents than Jackie. So, if we subtract the number of persimmons that Jake has from the total number of persimmons, we will get the number of persimmons that Jackie has. Therefore, the answer is 18 - 13 = 5.
"Response:  We know that at least one of these statements must be true because they are mutually exclusive:

* У Джейка на 3 персика меньше, чем у Стивена (Jake has fewer than 3 persimmons than Stephen)
* У Стивена на 8 персиков больше, чем у Джилл (Stephen has more than 8 persimmons than Jill)
* У Джилл на 5 персиков больше, чем у Стивена (Jill has more than 5 persimmons than Stephen)

So let's assume that statement (1) is true and Jake has fewer than 3 persimmons than Stephen. This means that Jake has x persimmons and Stephen has 3 + x persimmons.

We also know that Dill has 5 more persimmons than Steve, so Dill has 5 + x persimmons.

Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 3 = 5 + x

Solving for x, we get:

2 = x

Therefore, Jake has 2 more persimmons than Dill."
Response:  We know that: • Jake has fewer than 12 persimmons. • Steven has more than 11 persimmons and fewer than 12 persimmons. • Dill has 4 persimmons. Now we can calculate how many persimmons Dill has more or less than each of them: • Jake - 12 = x (we don't know yet) • Steven - 11 = y (y > x because Steven has more) • Dill - 4 = z (z < x because Dill has fewer) From the information given above, we can write two inequalities: x + y + z = 12 (since total number of persimmons is 12) and y > x (since Steven has more). Solving these inequalities, we get x = 6, y = 5, and z = 3. So, Dill has 3 more persimmons than Jake and 2 more than Steven.
"Response:  We know that:
* Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen (Jake has 7 percents, while Stephen has 16).
* Jake has more persimmon than Gillian (Jake has 9 persimmon, while Gillian has none).
So, we can conclude that Jake has 7 + 9 = 16 persimmon."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen and more than Gillian. So, if we assume that Jake has x per...
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Stephen and more percents than Gillian. So, if we compare their number of persimmons directly, we can see that:
Jake - 9 < Stephen - 16 > Gillian (no information provided)
Now, let's find out how many persimmons Stephen has more than Dillion:
Stephen - 16 = Dillon (no information provided)
So, Stephen has 16 - 0 = 16 more persimmons than Dillion."
"Response:  We know that:
* Стивен has more persimmons than Dill (S > D)
* Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve (J < S)
* Jake has 6 less persimmons than Steve (J - S = 6)
So, if Dill has 5 persimmons, then Jake has:
J = S - D + 6 = 18 - 5 + 6 = 17
Therefore, Jake has 17 persimmons."
"Response:  According to the information given in the problem:
Utah has fewer persimmons than Steve.
Steve has more persimmons than Jill.
Jill has 87 persimmons.
So, if Utah has x persimmons and Jill has 87 persimmons, then Utah has x - 87 persimmons more than Jill.
Now we know that Utah has fewer persimmons than Steve, so Utah has x - 87 less than Steve.
Therefore, the number of persimmons Utah has is x = 94."
"Response:  We know that:
* Стивен has more persimmons than Dill (S > D)
* Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve (J < S)
* Dill has 12 persimmons (D = 12)
So, we can conclude that:
Steve has x persimmons, where x is greater than 12 and less than or equal to 16 (since he has 16 - 12 = 4 more persimmons than Jake).
Therefore, the number of persimmons Steve has is between 13 and 16 inclusive."
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve.
Steve has 19 percents and 14 apples.
So Jake must have x persimmon less than Steve.
We also know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So Jake has 79 apples.
Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x - 12 = 79 (persimmons)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 61 (persimmons)
Therefore, Jake has 61 persimmons."
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve.
Steve has 9 persimmons and 8 apples.
So, Jake must have x apple(s).
We are also given that Jake has m... (read more)

Question: What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: Sure! To solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 11 - 5
2x = 6
Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:
x = 6 / 2
x = 3
Therefore, the value of x is 3."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve and more apples than him. So, we can write an equation for the number of persimmons each boy has:
Jake = x (less than 6)
Steve = 6 + y (more than 6)
Now, we are given that Jake has 6 less perseaons than Steve, so we can substitute this value in the first equation:
x - 6 = y
We also know that Steve has 17 persimmons and 16 apples, so we can use these values to find out how many apples Steve has:
y = 17 - 16
y = 1
So, Steve has one apple more than Jake. Now, let's find out how many apples Steve has:
y = 16
Apples = 16
Now, we want to know how much more apples than persimmons Steve has:
Difference between apples and persimmons = Apples - Persimmons
= 16 - x
Since we don't know the exact value of x, we cannot calculate the difference exactly. However, since Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve, we can say that the difference is positive. Therefore, the difference between apples and persimmons is greater than zero."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve and more apples than him. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Jake has x persimmons less than Steve.
Steve has y apples more than Jake.
We also know that Jake has 3 persimmons less than Steve, so we can substitute this value into the first equation:
x = 3 - (y / 2)
Now, let's solve for y:
y = 10 - x/2
Substituting the value of x from the problem statement:
y = 10 - (3/2)
y = 10 - 1.5
y = 8.5
So, Steve has 8.5 more apples than Jake."
Response:  We know that STEVEN has 12 persimmons and JASON has fewer than Steven. So, Jason has x persimmons. Since Diane has 67 more persimmons than Steve, we can say that Diane has 67 + x = 89 persimmons (since she has 89 - 67 = 22 more percimons than Steve). Now, we are told that Jason has m less persimmons than Diane, so we can write: x = m + 67. Substituting this value for x into the equation 67 + x = 89 gives us: 67 + (m + 67) = 89 which simplifies to: 134 = 2m + 67. Solving for m, we get: m = 57. Therefore, Jason has 57 persimmons.
Response:  We know that STEVEN has 18 persimmons and JASON has fewer than him. So, Jason has at least 18 - 12 = 6 persimmons less than Steven. Now we also know that Dillon has more persimmons than Jason, so Dillon has at least 6 + 8 = 14 persimmons. Therefore, Dillion has 14 persimmons.
Response:  We know that STEVEN has 19 persimmons and JASON has fewer than Steve. So, Jason must have at least 19 - 12 = 7 persimmons more than Steve. Therefore, Jason has 7 + 19 = 26 persimmons.
Response:  We know that STEVEN has 14 persimmons and JASON has 6 less than Steven. So Jason has 8 persimmons. Now we are told that Jason has 3 more persimmons than Diane. Therefore, Diane has 5 persimmons (8 - 3 = 5).
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So, if Jake has x apples and Steve has y per...
Response:  We know that: • Jake has more than 13 apples and fewer than 17 pears than Steve. • Steve has 8 pears and 12 apples. So, we can write an equation: Jake’s apple count = Steve’s apple count + (Jake’s pear count - Steve’s pear count) Now, let’s substitute the values given in the problem: Jake’s apple count = 12 + (13 - 8) = 12 + 5 = 17 Therefore, Jake has 17 apples.
"Response:  According to the problem, Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve and more apples than Steve. So, if we write down what we know about each fruit, we get:
Jake: 8 persimmons - 10 apples = X apples (where X is the number of apples that Jake has)
Steve: 11 apples + 18 persimmons = Y persimmons (where Y is the number of persimmons that Steve has)
Now, according to the problem statement, STEVE HAS MORE PERSIMONS THAN APPLES! That means that Y > X. In other words, Steve has more persimmons than Jake does. Therefore, the difference between the number of persimmons that Steve has and the number of apples that Jake has is greater than zero. Can you find out exactly how many more persimmons Steve has than Jake?"
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steve and more apples than Steve. So, if we compare their fruit collections, we can write down the following information:
Jake: 3 persimmons + 4 apples = 7 fruits
Steve: 19 apples + 15 persimmons = 34 fruits
Now, let's find out how many apples Steve has more than Jake:
Apples (Steve) - Apples (Jake) = 34 - 7 = 27
So, Steve has 27 more apples than Jake."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $78 in her purse initially. Then she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, we can write an equation as follows: $78 - $15 = x, where x is the amount of money Olivia has left after buying groceries. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $2 (since there are two dollars subtracted): $78 / $2 = $x + $15 / $2. Simplifying and solving for x gives us: $39. So, Olivia has $39 left in her purse after buying groceries.
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and has $33 left, then she had initially $101 ($78 + $33 = $101).
Response:  We know that Olivia had $100 in her purse initially and then withdrew an additional $148 from the bank. After spending money at the supermarket, she was left with $159. Therefore, we can calculate how much she spent as follows: Total amount = Initial balance + Withdrawn amount - Amount remaining after shopping = $100 + $148 - $159 = $23 So, Olivia spent $23 at the supermarket.
Response:  We know that Olivia had $3 in her purse and then she withdrew another $49 from the ATM. After spending money at the supermarket, she was left with $49. So, she spent $46 ($49 - $3) more than she took out of the ATM. Therefore, the correct answer is $46.
Response:  We know that Olivia had $53 in her purse and then she took out another $91 from the bank. So, after this transaction, she had $53 + $91 = $144. Then, she spent money at the supermarket and ended up with $144 - $14 = $130. Therefore, Olivia spent more money at the supermarket than she took out of the bank ($130 - $91 = $39).
Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her purse initially and after visiting both places she was left with $26. If she spent $49 at the mall, then she must have spent less than $49 at the supermarket. So, let's say she spent x dollars at the supermarket. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Total amount of money Olivia had = $106 Initially Amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket = x Less amount of money Olivia spent at the mall = $49 - x Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. To do so, we can use substitution method. Substituting 'x' = 35 (since she spent less than $49 at the supermarket), we get: Total amount of money Olivia had = $106 Initially Amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket = 35 Less amount of money Olivia spent at the mall = $49 - 35 = $14 Now, we check if this solution is correct by using the initial condition given in the problem. Since Olivia had $106 initially and spent $49 at the mall, the total amount of money she had after spending at the mall is: $106 - $49 = $57 And since she spent less than $49 at the supermarket, the amount of money she had after spending at the supermarket is: $57 - $35 = $22 Therefore, the value of 'x' that satisfies the equation is $35. So, Olivia spent $35 at the supermarket.
Response:  At first, Olivia had $54 in her purse. After she bought some things at the supermarket and paid with a $20 bill, she was left with $34 ($54 - $20). Then, after buying more items and paying with another $10 bill, she was left with $24 ($34 - $10). Finally, after buying one last item for $6, she was left with $18 ($24 - $6). Therefore, Olivia spent a total of $30 ($20 + $10 + $6) dollars.
Response:  If Oliva spent $38 at the supermarket and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she has $90 left after spending money ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  Dave had 19 applications on his phone initially. He deleted 5 of them, so he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone.
"Response:  We know that after deleting 18 apps, Dave had 5 left on his phone. So, if he started with X apps initially, we can write an equation as follows:
X - 18 = 5
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 23
So, Dave had 23 apps on his phone originally."
Response:  Dave had 10 applications initially and added 11 new ones, so he now has 21 applications in total (10 + 11 = 21). If he removed some of them, then after removing some, he will have less than 21 applications. So, the number of applications that he deleted is equal to the difference between his initial number of applications (10) and the final number of applications he has (4), which is 6 (10 - 4 = 6). Therefore, Dave deleted 6 applications.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and then added 89 new ones. So, his total number of applications is: 21 + 89 = 106. Now, he removed some applications, leaving him with 24. Therefore, the number of applications he added more than he removed is: 106 - 24 = 82.
Response:  Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 71 new applications, so now he has 86 (15 + 71) applications in total. To find out how many applications he deleted, we need to subtract the number of applications he had after deleting some from the total number of applications he had initially. So, if he had 14 applications left after deleting some, that means he deleted 72 applications (86 - 14 = 72). Therefore, Dave deleted more applications than he added.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 5 applications and 23 files left. To find out how many applications he deleted, we can divide the number of applications he had after deleting (5) by the number of applications he had before deleting (16): 5/16 = 0.3125. So, Dave deleted 4 applications. Similarly, to find out how many files he deleted, we can divide the number of files he had after deleting (23) by the number of files he had before deleting (77): 23/77 = 0.307. So, Dave deleted 7 files.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 files and applications initially. If he deleted some of them, then he has fewer files and applications now. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of files = Initial number of files - Number of files after deletion

Similarly, for applications:

Number of applications = Initial number of applications - Number of applications after deletion

Now, let's find out how many files and applications Dave deleted:

Initial number of files = 21
Final number of files = 7 (as given in the problem)
So, the number of files Dave deleted is:
21 - 7 = 14

Initial number of applications = 17
Final number of applications = 3 (as given in the problem)
So, the number of applications Dave deleted is:
17 - 3 = 14

Therefore, Dave deleted 14 files and 14 applications."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone before some of them were deleted. After deleting some of them, he had 21 applications and 4 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: 

Number of applications = 15 - x
Where x is the number of applications deleted.
Similarly, for files:

Number of files = 24 - y
Where y is the number of files deleted.
Now, we are asked how many more applications than files Dave has left on his phone. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of files from the number of applications:

More applications than files = Number of applications - Number of files
= 21 - 4
= 17
So, there are 17 more applications than files left on Dave's phone after some of the applications and files were deleted."
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone before some of them were deleted. After deleting some of them, he had 6 applications and 15 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of applications = 6 (given) Number of files = 15 - 18 = -3 (since one file was deleted) Now, let's solve for number of files: Number of files = 15 - 18 = -3 Number of files = -3 + 6 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 more files than applications left on Dave's phone after deleting some of them.
Response:  Dave had 17 applications on his phone before adding some more. After adding those new ones, he now has 18 applications in total. So, Dave added 1 application to his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and applications on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 12 applications left. So, we can say that he deleted 47 applications (59 - 12 = 47). Similarly, we know that he had 30 files after deleting some of them. So, he deleted 29 files (30 - 12 = 29). Therefore, Dave deleted 47 applications and 29 files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 17 applications and 21 files left. To find out how many files he deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the total number of files he had initially: 21 - 24 = -3. So, Dave deleted 3 files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone before some of them were deleted. After deleting some of them, he had 5 files and 12 applications left. To find out how many more applications than files he has, we need to subtract the number of files from the total number of applications: 12 (applications) - 5 (files) = 7 (more applications than files). So, there are 7 more applications than files left on Dave's phone after deleting some of them.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone before some of them were deleted. After deleting some of them, he had 24 files and 2 applications left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of files = 11 - x (where x is the number of files deleted) + 24 Number of applications = 3 + y (where y is the number of applications deleted) + 2 Now, let's solve for x and y: x = 11 - 5 = 6 (since 5 are the files deleted) y = 3 + 2 = 5 (since 2 applications were deleted) Therefore, there are 6 more files than applications remaining on Dave's phone.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards initially and gave 136 to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nell is:

242 - 136 = 106

Therefore, there are 106 cards left with Nell."
Response:  We know that Ne ll has given 301 of her cards to Jeff and now she has 154 left. So, if we subtract 301 from the total number of cards Ne ll had initially, we get: Number of cards Ne ll had initially = Total number of cards - Cards given to Jeff = 300 - 301 = -1 Now, according to the question, Ne ll had initially 300 cards. Therefore, the correct answer is: Number of cards Ne ll had initially = 300
Response:  We know that Ne ll had 528 cards initially and Jeff had 11 cards. So, Ne ll gave some of her cards to Jeff. Now, she has 252 cards left. To find out how many cards Ne ll gave to Jeff, we can divide the number of cards Ne ll has now (252) by the number of cards Jeff had initially (11). Therefore, Ne ll gave 23 cards to Jeff.
"Response:  If Nell had 566 card... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. If Nell had 566 cards to start with and gave Jeff some of them, then she has fewer cards left. We know that she gave him ""some"" cards, but we don't know exactly how many. So let's assume that she gave him half of her remaining cards. This means that after giving him cards, she has 566 - (half of 535) = 535 cards left. Therefore, Jeff now has 535 cards."
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 cards of 10 each. She gave some to Jeff, so she has fewer now. Let's call the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Number of baseball cards = 309 - x + 149 (since she has 149 cards of 10 each). Now, we need to find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than cards of 10. So, let's subtract the number of cards of 10 from the total number of baseball cards: More baseball cards than cards of 10 = 309 - x + 149 - 356 = 415 - 207 = 208. Therefore, Nell has 208 more baseball cards than cards of 10.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball player cards and 214 ten-card sets before she gave some of her cards to Jeff. After giving them away, she has 404 baseball player cards and 495 ten-card sets. So, we can write an equation: 246 + 214 = 404 + 495. Solving for the number of ten-card sets, we get: 214 = 391. Therefore, there are 391 ten-card sets more than the number of baseball player cards at Nell's disposal.
Response:  We know that Ne ll had 573 cards initially and gave some to John. So, after giving them to John, she had fewer cards than before. Then, she gave some more cards to Jeff. Now we are told that she has 210 cards left. Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her initial number of cards (573) and the number of cards she has now (210). That means Jeff got 363 cards from Ne ll.
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 cards of 10 each. She gave some to Jeff, so she has fewer now. Let's call the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Number of baseball cards = 438 - x + 178 (baseball cards) + 18 (cards of 10 each). Now, we need to find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than cards of 10. So, let's subtract the number of cards of 10 from both sides of the equation: Number of baseball cards > 178 - 18 = 160. Therefore, Nell has 160 more baseball cards than cards of 10.
"Response:  We know that Nell had initially 239 baseball cards and 38 ""10"" cards, so she had in total 277 cards (239 + 38). Then, she gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her collection to 376 ""10"" cards and 111 baseball cards. Therefore, the number of ""10"" cards more than baseball cards is:

376 - 111 = 265
So, there are 265 more ""10"" cards than baseball cards at Nell's collection after giving some cards to Jeff."
Response:  We know that Paco started with 40 peanuts and he ate 19 of them. So, the number of peanuts he had left is: 40 - 19 = 21. Therefore, Paco initially had 21 peanuts.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 28 peanuts initially and he ate some of them. The number of peanuts he ate is given as ""some"". So, we can assume that he ate at least one peanut. Therefore, the number of peanuts Paco ate is equal to 1. Now, we are asked how many peanuts Paco left after eating some of them. Since he had 28 peanuts initially and he ate 1 peanut, he has 27 peanuts left. Finally, we are told that Paco has 7 peanuts remaining. So, the total number of peanuts Paco ate is 1, and the number of peanuts he has remaining is 7. Hence, the answer is 1."
Response:  At first, Paco had 40 peanuts and he ate 2 of them, so now he has 40 - 2 = 38 peanuts left. Then, he bought 37 more peanuts, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 peanuts in total. Therefore, there are 75 peanuts left with Paco.
Response:  Paco had 25 peanuts and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 peanuts left. Then, he bought 3 more peanuts. Now, he has 20 + 3 = 23 peanuts in total. Therefore, he ate more peanuts than he bought.
Response:  Paco had 13 peanuts and he ate 2 of them, so he has 13 - 2 = 11 peanuts left. Then, he bought 36 more peanuts. So, in total, Paco has 11 + 36 = 47 peanuts. Therefore, he bought more peanuts than he ate.
Response:  Paco had 40 peanuts and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 peanuts left. Then, he gave 13 peanuts to his friend, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 peanuts left. Therefore, there are 22 peanuts left with Paco.
Response:  Paco had 17 peanuts and he ate 14 of them. So, he has 17 - 14 = 3 peanuts left. Then, he gave his friend 13 of those remaining peanuts. So, now Paco has 3 - 13 = -10 peanuts (he has fewer peanuts than before). Therefore, Paco ate more peanuts than he gave to his friend.
Response:  Paco had 12 pieces of bread and gave 21 to his friend. So he has 12 - 21 = -9 pieces of bread left. He also ate 16 pieces of bread, so he has -9 + 16 = 7 pieces of bread left. Therefore, he gave his friend more than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies. He ate 15 sweets and 54 salts. So, at this point, he has 22 - 15 = 6 sweet cookies left and 75 - 54 = 21 salty cookies left. Therefore, there are 6 sour cookies remaining with Paco.
Response:  At first, Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He then ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies. So, initially, he had 9 + 6 = 15 cookies in total. After eating some of them, he had 36 - 3 = 33 sweet cookies left. Therefore, there are 3 salty cookies remaining with Paco.
Response:  Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies initially. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies after that. So, now he has 37 - 5 = 32 sweet cookies and 11 + 2 = 13 salty cookies. Since he ate more sweet cookies than salty ones, he has more sweet cookies left than salty ones. Therefore, he has 32 - 13 = 19 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies initially. He then ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 salty cookies. So, after eating these cookies, he has 8 + 6 = 14 sweet cookies left, and 34 - 20 = 14 salty cookies left. Therefore, Paco ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate is 14 - 8 = 6.
Response:  If Paco had initially 37 peanuts and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 peanut left. So, the answer is 1 peanut.
Response:  We know that Paco had 36 peppers and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 36 - 14 = 22 peppers left. Then, he ate 10 of them, so he has 22 - 10 = 12 peppers left. Therefore, there are 12 peppers left with Paco.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 32 cookies left (41 - 9 = 32). He then ate 18 of them, leaving him with 14 cookies (32 - 18 = 14). Therefore, Paco ate more cookies than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 6 pies and gave away 30. So he has 6 - 30 = 24 left. He then ate 23 of them. To find out how many he gave away more than he ate, we need to subtract the number he ate from the total he had left: 24 - 23 = 1. Therefore, Paco gave away his friend more than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 97 salty pretzels and 34 sweet pretzels. Then he ate 15 sweet pretzels and 56 salty pretzels. So, after eating, Paco has 97 - 15 = 82 salty pretzels left and 34 - 56 = 0 sweet pretzels left. Therefore, there are no more sweet pretzels left with Paco.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 26 salty pretzels and 17 sweet pretzels. He ate 14 sweet pretzels and 9 salty pretzels. So, the number of salty pretzels left with Paco is: 26 - 9 = 17.
Response:  Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies initially. He ate 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet cookies afterward. So, the number of sweet cookies he ate is 32 - 23 = 9 more than the number of salty cookies he ate. Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet cookies and salty cookies he ate is 9.
Response:  Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies initially. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. So, he ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate is 28 - 15 = 13. Therefore, he ate 13 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  Gwen received $7 for her birthday and spent some money. So she had $7 - x dollars left after spending where x is an unknown number. Since she has $5 left, we can set up the equation: $7 - x = $5. Solving for x, we get: x = $2. Therefore, Gwen spent $2.
Response:  Gwen received some amount of dollars at her birthday and spent $8 out of it. So she has $6 left. We can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: Number of dollars Gwen received = x Number of dollars Gwen spent = 8 Now we want to find out how much money Gwen received on her birthday. To do that, we need to isolate the variable x in the equation. We can do this by subtracting $8 from both sides of the equation: Number of dollars Gwen received = x - 8 Now we have our final answer: Gwen received $x dollars on her birthday.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 from her dad, so she has a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 more from her dad, so she has a total of $13. If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, her mom gave her $2 more than her dad did (($9 - $5) / $5 = $2).
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mom and $6 more from her dad, so she got a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). So, Gwen received $5 more from her dad than from her mom.
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her dad and then her mom gave her an additional $7. So, in total, she got $12 ($5 + $7). If she spent $4, then she has $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). Therefore, her mom gave her $8 more than her dad.
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she has a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she received an additional $1 from her father compared to her mother. Therefore, the answer is $1.
Response:  We know that Josh had 9 glass balls in his collection initially. If he lost some of them, then he has fewer than 9 balls now. So, we can write an equation: 9 - x = 4, where x is the number of balls he lost. Solving for x, we get x = 5. Therefore, Josh lost 5 glass balls from his initial collection of 9.
Response:  If Josh had x shards in his collection and lost 21 of them, then he has x - 21 shards left. Since he now has 12 shards, we can set up an equation as follows: x = 12 + 21. Solving for x, we get that Josh originally had 33 shards in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 glass marbles in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 left. After that, he found 5 new ones, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 marbles in his collection. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.
Response:  Josh had 4 glass balls in his collection initially. He lost 16 balls and found 8 new ones. So, he has fewer balls now than he did at first. To find out how many fewer, we can subtract the number of balls he found from the number he lost: 16 - 8 = 8. Therefore, Josh lost 8 more balls than he found.
Response:  Josh had 7 glass balls in his collection initially. He lost 8 balls, so he has 7 - 8 = 9 balls left. Then, he found 10 new balls, so he now has 9 + 10 = 19 balls in total. Therefore, Josh found more balls than he lost.
Response:  Josh had 21 mosaics in his collection initially. He found 7 more mosaics later. So, the total number of mosaics he has now is: 21 + 7 = 28.
Response:  Josh had 20 glass marbles in his collection and gave 2 to Jack. So, he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left.
Response:  Josh had 22 mramors in his collection initially. Jack gave him 20 more mramors. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 mramors in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 19 marbles in his collection before he lost 11 of them. So, he has 19 - 11 = 8 marbles left now.
Response:  Josh had 22 glass balls in his collection initially. Then he found 13 of them and lost 5 of them. So, the number of glass balls he has now is: 22 - 5 = 17.
Response:  Josh had 15 glass balls in his collection and found 9 of them. So he lost 6 balls (15 - 9 = 6). Then, he lost 23 more balls, so he lost a total of 23 + 6 = 29 balls. Therefore, Josh lost 29 balls more than he found.
Response:  Josh had 3 glass balls in his collection initially. Then he found 6 more balls but lost 5 of them. So, the total number of balls he had after finding and losing some is: 3 + 6 - 5 = 8. Therefore, Josh found more balls than he lost.
Response:  The total weight of the clubnus collected by Marco and his father is given as 4 pounds (lb). Since Marco alone has 19 lb of clubnus, the weight of his father's clubnus must be 4 - 19 = -15 lb. This means that Marco's clubnus weighs more than his father's clubnus by 19 - (-15) = 34 lb. Therefore, Marco's clubnus weighs 34 lb more than his father's clubnus.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the clubnicker is 35 pounds (founnds). Since Marco and his dad together collected it, we can say that the weight of Marco's share is equal to half of the total weight minus the weight of the clubnicker he picked himself, which is 13 pounds. So, the weight of his dad's share is: $35 - 13 = 22 pounds$$. Therefore, the weight of his dad's clubnicker is $22 pounds$$ more than the weight of Marco's clubnicker.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the clubnus collected by Marco and his father is 20 pounds (фунты). Since the father's clubnus weighs 17 pounds, then the weight of Marco's clubnus is equal to 20 - 17 = 3 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marco's clubnus is 3 pounds.
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his dad's clubnicks is equal to the sum of their individual weights. So, the combined weight of Marco's clubnick and his dad's clubnick is: 8 + 32 = 40 pounds. Therefore, their clubnick together weighs 40 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together gathered 24 pounds of potatoes (clubnicks). On their way back, Marco lost 9 pounds of clubnicks, so now he has 3 pounds left. Therefore, his father had originally collected 15 pounds of clubnicks (24 - 9 = 15).
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together gathered 36 pounds of cranberries (clubnuck). On their way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of clubnuck. So now, Marco has 12 pounds of clubnuck left. Therefore, his dad's clubnuck must weigh 24 pounds (36 - 8 = 24).
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father together collected 22 pounds of cranberries. Then, on their way back, his father found an additional 30 pounds of cranberries. So, in total, Marcos has 52 pounds (22 + 30) of cranberries now. Therefore, his father's current weight of cranberries is 36 - 52 = -16 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 37 pounds of clubnuts (15 pounds x 2). So, if Marco's clubnut weighed 15 pounds, then his dad's clubnut must have weighed 22 pounds (37 pounds - 15 pounds = 22 pounds).
"Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 30 pounds of currants (clubnus). If their combined weight is 17 pounds, then the weight of clubnus collected by Marco's father is:

17 - 30 = -13 pounds
So, the weight of clubnus collected by Marco was 30 - (-13) = 43 pounds more than the weight of clubnus collected by his father."
"Response:  We know that Marco and his dad together collected 26 pounds of clubnuts (which is equal to 11 kg). Since Marco's share was 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg), we can calculate how much heavier his father's share was compared to Marco's as follows:

Weight of Marco's share = 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg)
Weight of his father's share = Total weight - Weight of Marco's share = 26 pounds - 10 pounds = 16 pounds (or 7.3 kg)
Therefore, his father's share of clubnuts was 16 pounds (or 7.3 kg) more than Marco's share."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the clubnicks collected by Marco and his dad is 30 pounds (or 30 f). Since Marco's father's clubnick weighed 11 pounds (or 11 f), then the weight of Marco's clubnick can be calculated as follows:
Weight of Marco's clubnick = Total weight - Weight of father's clubnick
= 30 f - 11 f
= 19 f
Therefore, Marco's clubnick weighs 19 pounds or 19 f."
Response:  At first, there were 2 children in the bus. Then, some more children got on the bus at the stop. So, now there are 10 children in total on the bus. To find out how many children got on the bus after the stop, we need to subtract the original number of children from the current number of children: 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, 8 children got on the bus after the stop.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children in the bus. Then, another 38 children got into the bus at the stop. So, now there are 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that some children went to school on an bus and there were already 2 children sitting at the bus stop when they arrived. So, in total, there are now 41 children on the bus. To find out how many children went to school on the bus before stopping, we can subtract the number of children who were already at the bus stop from the total number of children on the bus: 41 - 2 = 39. Therefore, 39 children went to school on the bus before stopping.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off. In this case, it means we need to subtract the number of children who got off from 43. Therefore, the answer is: 21 - x = 0, where x is the number of children who got off at the stop. Solving for x, we get x = 22. Thus, 22 children got off the bus at the stop.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 41 children in the bus. After some of them got off at the stop, we are told that ""some"" of them left the bus. This means that the number of children remaining on the bus is less than 41. So, the number of children who remained on the bus after some of them got off is:

41 - Some (less than 41) = 18

Therefore, there were 18 children on the bus after some of them got off at the stop."
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the stop, there were 10 less children left in the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children, i.e., 21 - 10 = 11. Therefore, 11 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children in the bus and after stopping at the station, 63 children got off the bus. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 5 + (63 - 5) = 78 children. Therefore, 78 - 14 = 64 children remained in the bus after some other children got off. Hence, 64 children more than those who left the bus boarded it.
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children on the bus and after stopping at the station, 68 children got off the bus. So, in total, 36 + 68 = 104 children boarded the bus. Now, we are told that some of them left the bus, leaving only 12 children behind. Therefore, the number of children who left the bus is equal to the number of children who remained on it - 12 = 92. Hence, 92 more children got off the bus than got on it.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 more got into the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after reaching the stop is: 22 + 40 = 62. Now, some of them left the bus, so the remaining number of children in the bus is: 62 - 2 = 60. Therefore, 60 children exited the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 children got into the bus while some left it. So, the total number of children who entered the bus is 82 - 28 = 54. Now, we are told that 30 children remained in the bus after some left it. Therefore, the number of children who left the bus is 30 - 28 = 2. Hence, the correct answer is 54 - 2 = 52 children more entered the bus than left it.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children in the bus and then 24 more children got into the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after the stop is:

23 + 24 = 47

Now, some children left the bus, so the number of children remaining in the bus is:

47 - 8 = 39

Therefore, 39 children remained in the bus after some children left it."
Response:  If the baker made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than 51 tarts. So, the number of tarts that the baker made is greater than 51. Therefore, the answer is 82 (133 - 51 = 82).
Response:  The baker made 54 tarts and sold some of them. We know that he has 13 tarts left. So, we can calculate how many tarts he sold as follows: Number of tarts sold = Total number of tarts - Number of tarts left = 54 - 13 = 41 tarts. Therefore, the baker sold 41 tarts.
Response:  We know that the baker sold 145 tarts and has 72 left. So, if he sold all of them, then he must have made more than 145 tarts. Therefore, the number of tarts the baker made is equal to 145 + 72 = 217.
Response:  The baker made 155 tarts and his friend bought 140 of them. So, if we subtract the number of tarts that were sold from the total number of tarts made, we get: 155 - 140 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 tarts left with the baker.
Response:  The baker made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) left. Then, he bought 170 new torts, which means he now has 36 (16 + 170) torts in total. So, there are 36 torts remaining at the bakery.
Response:  The baker made 13 tarts and sold 91 of them, so he has 13 - 91 = 78 remaining tarts left. Then, he bought 154 new tarts, which means he now has 78 + 154 = 232 tarts in total. So, the baker bought more tarts than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new tarts. Now he has 92 + 31 = 123 tarts in total. Therefore, the baker sold more tarts than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 remaining (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made another 76 tarts. Now, he has 35 + 76 = 111 tarts in total.
Response:  The baker made 144 tarts and sold 71 of them. So he has 73 remaining (144 - 71 = 73). Then he made another 111 tarts. Now he has a total of 184 tarts (73 + 111 = 184). Therefore, the number of tarts that the baker made more than he sold is 184 - 71 = 113.
"Response:  The baker made 149 tarts and 91 pastries. If he sold 10 tarts and 90 pastries, then the number of tarts left with the baker is:

Tarts = Total tarts - Sold tarts = 149 - 10 = 139

Therefore, there are 139 tarts remaining with the baker."
Response:  The baker made 7 tarts and 148 pies. If he sold 15 tarts and 103 pies, then the number of pies left with the baker is: 148 - 103 = 45 pies.
"Response:  We know that the baker made 126 tarts and 48 pies. If he sold 115 tarts and 81 pies, then we can calculate how many more tarts than pies he made as follows:

Number of tarts made - Number of tarts sold = Number of tarts left with the baker
= 126 - 115 = 11

So, the baker made 11 more tarts than pies."
Response:  According to the question, the baker made 19 tarts and 131 pastries. If he sold 70 tarts and 88 pastries, then we can calculate how many more pastries than tarts he made as follows: Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = Number of pastries left with the baker. In this case, the number of pastries made is 131, and the number of pastries sold is 88, so the number of pastries left with the baker is: 131 - 88 = 43. Therefore, the baker made 43 more pastries than tarts.
"Response:  According to the question, the baker made 157 tarts and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 tarts and 147 pastries, then we can write an equation as follows:

Torts = Solds (torts) + Remaining torts
Pastries = Sold (pastries) + Remaining pastries

Now let's solve for ""Remaining torts"" and ""Remaining pastries"":

Remaining torts = Torts - Sold torts
= 157 - 158
= -1

Remaining pastries = Pastries - Sold pastries
= 169 - 147
= 22

So there are 22 more tarts than pastries that the baker sold. Therefore, the number of tarts the baker sold is greater than the number of pastries he sold."
Response:  We know that the baker made 54 tarts and 143 pies. If he sold 68 tarts and 92 pies, then we can calculate how many more pies than tarts he sold as follows: Number of pies sold = 92 - 68 = 24 Number of tarts sold = 68 Therefore, there are 24 more pies than tarts sold by the baker.
Response:  The baker initially made 48 tarts and sold 44 of them. So, there are 48 - 44 = 14 tarts left with the baker.
Response:  If the baker initially made 40 tarts and sold 8 of them, then he has 32 remaining (40 - 8 = 32). So, the baker made more tarts than he sold. Therefore, the correct answer is 32.
Response:  The baker initially made 169 tarts and sold 137 of them. So he has 32 tarts left (169 - 137 = 32).
Response:  The baker made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones. So he has (173 - 103) = 70 tarts left. He sold 86 tarts, so now he has (70 - 86) = -14 tarts. Since it can't be negative, there are no tarts left for the baker. Therefore, the correct answer is zero (0).
Response:  The baker made 99 tarts, bought 167 new ones, and sold 89. So he has 89 - 99 = -10 tarts left with him. Therefore, the baker bought more tarts than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 8 tarts, bought 139 new ones, and sold 145 tarts. So, he sold more than he bought. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of tarts he bought from the number of tarts he sold: 145 - 139 = 6. Therefore, the baker sold 6 more tarts than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 62 tarts first and then added another 149. So in total he has 62 + 149 = 211 tarts. He sold 144 of them, so the number of remaining tarts is 211 - 144 = 67. Therefore, there will be 67 tarts left with the baker.
Response:  The baker made 81 tarts and then made another 92 tarts. So in total, he made 173 tarts (81 + 92). He sold 46 of them, which means that he has 127 tarts left (173 - 46 = 127). Therefore, the baker made more tarts than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 61 pies and 167 tarts. If he sold 108 tarts and 44 pies, then the number of tarts left with the baker is: Number of tarts left = Total number of tarts - Sold tarts = 167 - 108 = 59 tarts. Therefore, there are 59 tarts remaining with the baker.
Response:  The baker made 56 pies and 124 tarts. If he sold 104 tarts and 29 pies, then the number of remaining pies is: 56 - 29 = 27. So, there are 27 pies left with the baker.
Response:  The pekaer made 52 pies and 84 tarts. If he sold 102 tarts and 94 pies, then... (calculate)...the number of tarts sold is greater than the number of pies sold. So, the number of tarts sold is 102 - 94 = 8 more than the number of pies sold. Therefore, the baker made 8 more tarts than pies.
Response:  According to the question, the baker made 134 pies and 11 tarts. If he sold 140 tarts and 92 pies, then we can calculate how many more pies than tarts the baker made as follows: Number of pies made - Number of pies sold = Number of pies left with the baker 134 - 140 = -6 (negative sign indicates that there are fewer pies left) Similarly, we can calculate how many more tarts than pies the baker made as follows: Number of tarts made - Number of tarts sold = Number of tarts left with the baker 11 - 92 = 81 (positive sign indicates that there are more tarts left) Therefore, the baker made more tarts than pies. So, the answer is 81.
Response:  We know that the baker made 14 tarts and 153 pies. If he sold 8 pies and 97 tarts, then we can calculate how many more tarts were sold than pies as follows: Number of tarts sold = Total number of tarts - Number of tarts sold = 14 - 8 = 6 More tarts were sold than pies. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  According to the question, the baker made 43 tarts and 114 pies. If he sold 154 pies and 78 tarts, then we can calculate how many more pies were sold than tarts as follows: Number of pies sold = 154 Number of tarts sold = 78 Difference between number of pies and tarts = 76 (more pies were sold) Therefore, according to the information provided in the question, the baker sold more pies than tarts.
Response:  Kelly has 22 games from Nintendo and needs to buy 140 more games - (22) = x. So, she needs to buy x games.
Response:  Kelly has 106 games for Nintendo. If she gives away 64 games, then she will have 42 games left (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  Kelly had 91 games from Nintendo initially. If she has 92 games now, that means she gained one game. So, originally, Kelly had 91 + 1 = 92 games.
Response:  Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To leave 12 games from Nintendo, she needs to give away some of her Nintendo games. We can start with 4 games since 4 x 20 = 80, which is less than 70 (the number of Sony games she has). So, Kelly needs to give away 4 Nintendo games to have 12 left.
"Response:  Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and needs to give 31 games from Sony to have an equal number of games for both consoles. So, we need to find out how many games from Sony Kelly currently has so that she can give away an equal number to balance it out.
We know that Kelly has 132 games from Sony, so if she gives away 31 games, she will be left with 101 games from Sony.
So, Kelly needs to give away 71 games (132 - 101) from Sony to balance it out with her 46 games from Nintendo."
Response:  Kelly has 80 games for Nintendo and found additional 31 games. So, in total, she has 80 + 31 = 111 games. To have only 6 games left, Kelly needs to give away 111 - 6 = 105 games.
Response:  If Randy has 38 blocks left and he used 52 blocks to build the tower, then initially he had 52 - 38 = 14 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he has 72 blocks left after building the tower, then we can say that he used 97 - 72 = 25 blocks to build the tower. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  Randy has 79 blocks in total. He uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, he has 79 - (14 + 11) = 54 blocks left.
Response:  Randy has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower. So, he has 31 blocks left (58 - 27 = 31). Now, he uses 53 blocks to build a house. So, he has 18 blocks left (31 - 53 = 18). Therefore, Randy used a total of 18 + 27 = 45 blocks to build both the tower and the house together.
Response:  Randy has 37 blocks in total. He used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. So, he used more blocks for building the tower than for building the house. The difference between these two numbers is: 33 - 13 = 20. Therefore, Randy used 20 blocks more for building the tower than for building the house.
"Response:  Randy has 86 blocks and he used 79 to build a tower and 82 to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Blocks used for tower = 86 - 79 = 8
Blocks used for house = 82
Now, we need to find out how many more blocks were used to build the house than the tower. We can do this by subtracting the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house:
More blocks used for house = 82 - 8 = 74
So, Randy used 74 more blocks to build his house than he did to build his tower."
Response:  Randy used 36 blocks to build a tower. So he had 59 - 36 = 23 blocks left after building the tower.
Response:  Randy has 95 blocks and he uses 20 to build a house (which means he has 75 left). He then uses 50 of those remaining blocks to build a tower (which means he has 25 left). So, Randy used more blocks to build the tower than he did for the house. Therefore, the correct answer is: More blocks were used for building the tower than for building the house.
Response:  Randy has 90 blocks and uses 89 to build a house and 63 to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the tower, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks available (90 - 63 = 27). So, Randy used 27 more blocks to build the house than to build the tower.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 books in total and we have already read 5 of them. So, the number of books we have not yet read is:

20 - 5 = 15

Therefore, we have already read 5 books out of the total of 20 books in the series ""Сuмасшедшая глупая школа""."
"Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the series that we have read so far and 8 more that we haven't read yet. Therefore, the total number of books in the series is:

13 + 8 = 21

So, there are 21 books in the ""Silly School"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 22 different books in the series and we have already read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books we need to read, we can subtract the number of books we have already read from the total number of books: 22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, we still need to read 10 more books from the series. Similarly, for films, we know that there are 10 different films in the series and we have already watched 56 of them. Subtracting the number of films we have already watched from the total number of films gives us the number of films we still need to watch: 10 - 56 = -46. Since negative numbers cannot be used as an answer, we will round up to zero (0) to indicate that we have already watched all the available films in the series.
Response:  We know that there are 4 different books in the series and we have read 19 of them. This means that there are 15 remaining books (4 - 19 = 15). Similarly, we know that there are 17 films in the series and we have watched 7 of them. This means that there are 10 remaining films (17 - 7 = 10). Therefore, to find out how many more films you need to watch, you simply subtract the number of films you have already watched from the total number of films available: 10 - 7 = 3. So, you still need to watch 3 more films from the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Silly School"". If we read 19 books, then we have read 19 - 16 = 3 more books than the number of films. Therefore, there are 3 more books than films in the series ""Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""Silly School"". If we read 19 books, it means we have read 19/8 = 2.375 books from the series (since there are 8 books total). Similarly, if we watched 61 films, it means we have watched 61/10 = 6.1 films more than the number of books we read. Therefore, there are 6.1 - 2.375 = 3.725 more films than books in the series ""Silly School"". So, there are 3.725 more films than books in the series."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in total. If we read 13 books, then we have read more than 10 books. Similarly, if we watched 12 films, then we have watched fewer than 11 films. Therefore, the number of books we read is greater than the number of films we watched. So, the answer is 13 - 11 = 2.
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 films in total. If we read 7 books, then we have 4 (11 - 7) books left to read. Similarly, if we watched 21 films, then we have 56 (17 - 21) films left to watch. So, we have read more books than films. Therefore, the answer is 4.
"Response:  We have read 8 books from the series ""Crazy Stupid School"". If there are 14 books in total in the series, then we need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different books in total. If we have watched 34 films and read 4 books, then we still need to watch 28 more films (62 - 34 = 28). So, we need to watch 28 more films.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 films in total and we have watched 4 of them so far. So, to find out how many more films we need to watch, we can subtract the number of films we have already watched from the total number of films. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of films left to watch = Total number of films - Number of films watched = 8 - 4 = 4

So, you still need to watch 4 more films from the series ""Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 different films and 15 different books in the series ""Silly School"". If we read 11 books, then we have not read all of them (since there are 15 total). Therefore, the number of books left to read is equal to the number of books - the number of books we read = 15 - 11 = 4. So, there are 4 more books than movies in the series ""Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 films in the series and we have watched 63 of them. This means that we have not watched 100% of the films (63 / 17 = 3.59). Similarly, we know that there are 11 books in the series and we have read 13 of them. This means that we have not read 100% of the books (13 / 11 = 1.18). Therefore, there are more films than books in the series ""Сuмасшедшая глупая школа"". The difference between the number of films and books is 3.59 - 1.18 = 2.41. So, there are 2.41 more films than books in the series ""Сумасшедшая глупая школа""."
Response:  We know that there are 10 different books in the series and we have watched 19 of them. So, the number of books we haven't watched is 10 - 19 = -9. Similarly, we know that there are 6 different films in the series and we have watched 14 of them. So, the number of films we haven't watched is 6 - 14 = -8. Therefore, we have read more books than films. The difference between the number of books read and films not watched is 14 (books) - (-8) (films) = 22. Hence, we have read 22 more books than films.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in total. If we read 16 books and watched 19 films, then we have read more books than films. So, the number of films we watched is less than the number of books we read. To find out how many fewer films we watched, we can subtract the number of films from the number of books: 19 - 16 = 3. Therefore, we watched 3 fewer films than books.
Response:  We know that Dave won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy toys. So he has 2 remaining tickets. To find out how many tickets Dave used to buy toys, we can divide the number of tickets he bought (toys) by the number of tickets he had left (2). Therefore, Dave used 3 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  We know that Dave won some number of tickets in the arcade and used 12 of them to buy something. This means he has X tickets left, where X is the total number of tickets he won minus the 12 he used. Since he has 14 tickets left, we can set up the equation: X = 14. Solving for X, we get: X = 26. So Dave won 26 tickets in the arcade.
Response:  We know that Dave won 18 tickets and spent $5 on toys and $11 on clothes. So, he has $18 - $5 = $13 left after buying things. Therefore, Dave has 13 tickets remaining.
Response:  If Dave used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 tickets to buy clothes, then he used more tickets for toys than for clothes. So, Dave used 5 more tickets (12 - 7 = 5) for buying toys than for buying clothes.
Response:  If Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys and he has 18 more tickets left over to buy clothes, then Dave used 8 + 18 = 26 tickets in total to buy both things. So, Dave used more tickets to buy clothes than he did for toys.
Response:  We know that Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. Then we are told that Dave spent $10 on toys, which means he has $10 / 2 = $5 left after buying the toys. So, Dave has 12 tickets and $5 left.
"Response:  We know that Haley had 14 trees in her backyard before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 9 of them died. So, we have:

Number of trees that survived = 14 - 9 = 5

Therefore, more trees died than survived in the typhoon."
Response:  We know that Haley had 13 trees in her backyard before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 6 of them died. So, we have 13 - 6 = 7 trees left. Therefore, more trees survived than died after the typhoon.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 20 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon, only 4 trees remained. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of trees = 20 - Number of trees remaining after typhoon. In this case, number of trees remaining after typhoon is 4. Therefore, we can solve for the original number of trees using subtraction: Number of trees = 20 - 4 = 16. Hence, Haley originally had 16 trees in her backyard.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Hayley planted several trees in her backyard before the typhoon hit. After the typhoon, 5 of the trees died. So, initially, Hayley had x trees. Now, we know that x - 5 = 12, since there are still 12 trees left after the disaster. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, Hayley originally planted 7 trees in her backyard.
"Response: 
Hayley had 9 trees in her backyard before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 4 of them died, leaving 9 - 4 = 5 trees alive. Then she planted 5 new trees, so now Hayley has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total."
Response:  At first, Haley had 12 trees in her yard. After the typhoon, two of them died. So, the number of trees left is: 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in her yard.
Response:  At first, Haley had 3 trees in her yard. After the typhoon, 10 trees died (13 - 3 = 10). So, the number of trees that perished during the typhoon is 10 more than the number of trees she initially had, which is 3 + 10 = 13. Therefore, 13 more trees died than survived.
Response:  We know that Haley initially grew 11 trees in her yard and after the typhoon, 2 of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, more trees survived than died, i.e., 9 > 2.
"Response:  If they collect 66 meals in a day and each meal contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges are collected in total as follows:
Total number of oranges = Number of meals x Number of oranges per meal
= 66 x 28
= 1904 oranges
Therefore, they collect 1904 oranges in a day."
Response:  If they collect 8 meshes per day, it means that in one day they will collect 8/1 = 8 mesh of apples. To collect 24 mesh of apples, they need to collect for 3 days (24 / 8 = 3). Therefore, it will take them 3 days to gather 24 mesh of apples.
"Response:  If they collect apples for 4 days and collected 56 baskets of apples in total, then they must have collected x baskets per day, where x is the number of days they collected apples. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can write:
x = 56 / 24
x = 2
So, they collected 2 baskets of apples per day."
Response:  If they collect 38 meals per day and each meal contains 42 apples, then in one day they will collect 38 x 42 = 1604 apples. In total, during 49 days of harvesting, they will collect 1604 x 49 = 78528 apples. Therefore, after 49 days of harvesting, there will be 78528 meals of apples.
Response:  They collect 66 meals per day and each meal contains 25 apples. So in total they collect 66 x 25 = 1600 apples per day. Now we need to find out how many days it takes for them to collect 87 days of apple harvest. Therefore, we divide 87 by 1600: 87 / 1600 = 0.0546 (or approximately 54.6 days). Since they collect apples every day, after 54.6 days they will have collected 87 days worth of apples. Therefore, their final total is 1600 x 54.6 = 86,960 apples.
Response:  If they collect 8 meshes per day and each mesh contains 35 oranges, then they collect in total 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they collect 16 meshes per day and each mesh contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will collect 16 x 57 = 902 oranges. To collect 80 meshes of oranges, it will take them 80 / 902 = 8.84 days. Therefore, it will take them approximately 8.84 days to gather 80 meshes of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 67 meals of oranges per day and each meal contains 12 oranges, then they collect 67 x 12 = 804 oranges per day. Now, if they collect only 35 meals of oranges, then they will collect 35 x 12 = 420 oranges per day. So, the answer is 420 oranges.
Response:  They collect 74 meshes per day and throw away 71 of them, which means they have collected 3 meshes more than they threw away. So after 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 3 x 51 = 153 meshes of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 76 baskets per day and throw away 64 of them, that means they have collected 12 baskets with apples (since 76 - 64 = 12). Since each basket contains 50 apples, they have collected 12 x 50 = 600 apples in total per day.
Response:  They collect 28 meals of ripe oranges and 52 meals of immature oranges per day for 26 days. Therefore, they will have collected in total: 28 x 26 = 704 meals of ripe oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 meals of immature oranges. So, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 meals of oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 25 x 82 = 2050 meks of apples (both speos and immature). So, there will be 2050 - 61 = 1439 mekshands of mature apples left after 25 days of harvesting.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 24 meshes of immature oranges + (31 x 45) = 1365 meshes of mature oranges. So, after 45 days, there will be 1365 - 24 = 1341 meshes of unripe oranges left to gather.
Response:  The number of speckled apples collected daily is given as 44 + 25 = 69. So, there are more speckled apples than unripe ones collected every day. Therefore, the difference between the number of speckled and unripe apples collected daily is 44 - 25 = 19.
Response:  We know that every day they collect 5 meals of ripe oranges and 74 meals of unripe oranges. So, in total, they collect 5 + 74 = 79 meals of oranges per day. Since we are asked how many more unripe than ripe oranges they collect each day, we can say that the number of unripe oranges collected is 79 - 5 = 74 meals per day. Therefore, there are 74 more unripe oranges than ripe oranges collected each day.
"Response:  If they collected 54 meshes of oranges in total and they gathered 18 meshers per day, then we can calculate how many days it took to collect all those oranges as follows:

Total number of meshes = 54
Number of meshes per day = 18
Days required to gather all the oranges = Total number of meshes / Number of meshes per day = 54 / 18 = 3
Therefore, it took them 3 days to gather all 54 meshes of oranges."
"Response:  If they collected 56 meals of oranges in total, and they gathered for 14 days, then we can calculate how many meals they collected per day as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of meals / Number of meals per day
= 14 days
Number of meals per day = Total number of meals / Number of days
= 56 meals / 14 days
= 4 meals per day
Therefore, they collected 4 meals of oranges per day."
Response:  After 73 days of gathering, they have collected 25 x 73 = 1825 unripe apples and 5 x 73 = 365 ripe apples. So, the total number of ripe apples after 73 days is 365 + 1825 = 2190 ripe apples.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 65 = 390 unripe oranges and 46 specially grown oranges per day. Therefore, after 6 days, they will have collected in total 390 + 46 = 436 unripe oranges.
"Response:  The number of speckled apples collected daily is given as 86, and the number of unripe apples collected daily is 41. So, we have:

Number of ripe apples = 86 - 41 = 45

Therefore, more ripe apples are collected each day than unripe ones."
Response:  We know that every day they collect 71 meals of unripe oranges and 60 meals of ripe oranges. So, in total, they collect 71 + 60 = 131 meals of oranges per day. Since we are asked how many more unripe than ripe oranges they collect each day, we can say that the difference between the number of unripe and ripe oranges collected is equal to the number of unripe oranges collected minus the number of ripe oranges collected. Therefore, the difference is 131 - 60 = 71 meals of unripe oranges collected each day more than the number of ripe oranges collected.
Response:  The length of the room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how long it is compared to its width, we need to divide the length by the width. So, the ratio of the length to the width is: $ \frac{12}{11} = 1.09$  Therefore, the room is slightly longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that the length of Jessie's room is 7 feet (or 8.5 feet if we convert it to decimal format). To find out how wide her room is, we need to divide its length by the area of the rug she wants. The area of the rug is given as 14 square feet. So, we can calculate the width of Jessie's room as follows: Width = Length / Area of Rug = 7 / 14 = 0.5 (or 0.5 x 3 = 1.5 feet) Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is approximately 1.5 feet or 18 inches.
"Response:  We know that the width of Jessie's room is 7 feet = 84 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). So, we can calculate the length of the room as follows: Length = Width x Number of Feet + Number of Inches / 12 Since we want the length to be equal to 14 square feet, we can set up an equation like this: Length = 7 x 10 + (84 / 12) = 14 Now let's solve for ""Length"": Length = 14 x 10 + 7 = 1160 + 7 = 1167 inches Therefore, the length of Jessie's room is 1167 inches or approximately 98.5 feet."
Response:  The room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, so its area is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since Jessie already has 16 square feet of carpet, she needs 165 - 16 = 149 square feet more to cover the entire half of the room.
Response:  The room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, so its area is 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Since each tile has an area of 4 square feet, we need to divide the total area of the room by the area of one tile to find out how many tiles she needs: 24 sq ft / 4 sq ft = 6 tiles. Therefore, Jessie needs 6 tiles to cover half of the room.
Response:  The total area of all rooms is given as follows: Area = Length x Width = 19 ft x 18 ft = 342 sq ft Now we need to find out how much carpeting Jessie needs for each room. Since there are 20 rooms in total, the number of square feet of carpeting needed per room is: Number of square feet of carpeting needed per room = Total area / Number of rooms = 342 sq ft / 20 rooms = 17.1 sq ft Therefore, Jessie will need 17.1 square feet of carpeting per room.
Response:  The width of the room is given as 19 feet and its length is given as 20 feet. To find out how long the room is compared to its width, we can divide the length by the width: Length / Width = 20 ft / 19 ft = 1.056. So, the room is about 5.6% longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug of size 10 square feet to cover his room. Since the length of the room is 5 feet, we can calculate the width as follows: Width = Length x Area per Foot = 5 ft x 10 sq ft/ft = 50 sq ft Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is 50 square feet.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug of size 10 square feet to cover his room. Since her room has a width of 2 feet, we can calculate its length as follows: Length = Width x Area of Rug / Size of Room Length = 2 ft x 10 sq ft / 10 ft = 20 ft Therefore, the length of Jessie's room is 20 feet.
Response:  We know that Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet and her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To cover the entire floor, she needs to have enough carpet to cover an area of 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. So, she needs 80 - 18 = 62 square feet more carpet.
Response:  We know that the store received $23 for each sold t-shirt and they earned $230 during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of football = Total amount earned $23 x Number of football = $230 Now, we need to find out how many footballs were sold. To do this, we divide the total amount earned by the price per football: Number of football = $230 ÷ $23 = 10 footballs Therefore, the store sold 10 footballs during the game.
Response:  The total revenue of the store is $51, and they sold 3 football jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University. Therefore, we can calculate the cost price of each football jersey as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Football Jerseys x Cost Price per Football Jersey Total Revenue = $51 x? Cost Price per Football Jersey = Total Revenue / Number of Football Jerseys Cost Price per Football Jersey = $51 / 3 Cost Price per Football Jersey = $17 Each football jersey costs $17.
Response:  We know that the store earned $87 per sold t-shirt and they sold a total of 95 t-shirts during both games. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they earned $403 ($87 x 47) in revenue from selling t-shirts during that game alone.
Response:  We know that the total number of football shirts sold during both games is 242. If they sold 115 football shirts during the Arkansas game, then the number of football shirts sold during the Texas Tech University game is 127 (242 - 115).
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling football shirts during both games is $98 x 2 = $196. Since they sold 163 football shirts in total, we can calculate how much they earned per game as follows: $196 / 2 = $98. Therefore, they earned $98 for each game.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling football shirts during both games is $78 x 186 = $14,508. Since they sold 172 football shirts during the Arkansas game, the amount of money earned from those sales is $78 x 172 = $13,096. Therefore, the amount of money earned from selling football shirts during the Texas Tech game is $14,508 - $13,096 = $1,412.
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt they sell, they get $62 and for each hoodie they sell, they get $99. So if they sold x football shirts, they got $62x dollars and if they sold y hoodies, they got $99y dollars. Now we are told that they sold 183 football shirts and 31 hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University. Therefore, their total revenue from selling football shirts is $62 \* 183 = $11,546 and their total revenue from selling hoodies is $99 \* 31 = $3079. So, in total, they earned $11,546 + $3079 = $14,625.
Response:  We know that the shop earns $67 for each football shirt and $165 for each baseball cap. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University, they sold 74 football shirts and 156 baseball caps. So, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total revenue = Number of football shirts x Price per football shirt + Number of baseball caps x Price per baseball cap In this case, the total revenue would be: Total revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 = $53,980 + $25,990 = $79,970 Therefore, the shop earned $79,970 from selling baseball caps during the game.
Response:  We know that the total revenue of the store is $192 for each football shirt and $34 for each baseball shirt. So, the total revenue from selling football shirts is $192 x 157 = $28,690. Similarly, the total revenue from selling baseball shirts is $34 x 19 = $656. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a football shirt and a baseball shirt is: $28,690 - $656 = $28,034.
"Response:  We know that the cost of each football jersey is $86 and the cost of each t-shirt is $232. So, if they sold x football jerseys and y t-shirts during the game, then their total revenue from these sales would be:
R = 0.86x + 2.32y
We are also given that they sold 254 football jerseys and 43 t-shirts. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation above to solve for y:
R = 0.86(254) + 2.32(43) = 2179.6 + 966.6 = 3146.2
Now, we want to find out how much more expensive the t-shirt is than the football jersey. To do this, we can subtract the value of x (the number of football jerseys sold) from the value of y (the number of t-shirts sold):
Difference = y - x = 43 - 254 = -211
So, the difference between the price of a t-shirt and a football jersey is -$211. Therefore, the price of a t-shirt is $211 cheaper than the price of a football jersey."
Response:  The original price of each football is $51. During the game, they offered a discount of $8 per football, so the new price became $43 ($51 - $8). Since they sold 130 footballs, their total revenue from selling footballs can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Number of footballs x Price per football Revenue = 130 x $43 Revenue = $5270 So, they earned $5270 in revenue from selling footballs during the game.
Response:  The original price of each football was $201. During the game, they increased the price to $418 (201 x 2 = 402 + 15). They sold 14 footballs during this time period. So, the total amount of money earned from selling footballs is: Total revenue = Number of footballs sold x Original price per football = 14 x $201 = $2,850.
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University, the Razorback store made $60 selling t-shirts. If they get $10 from each sold t-shirt, then we can calculate how many t-shirts were sold as follows: Number of t-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per t-shirt So, in this case, number of t-shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts Therefore, the Razorback store sold 6 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the game is $215, and they sold 5 footballs. So, we can calculate the cost of each football as follows: Cost = Total Amount / Number of Footballs = $215 / 5 = $43 per football. Therefore, the cost of each football is $43.
Response:  The shop receives $5 for each t-shirt and $5 for each hoodie. They sold 20 t-shirts and 64 hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University. Therefore, they earned $100 from selling t-shirts ($5 x 20) and $320 from selling hoodies ($5 x 64). So, in total, they earned $420.
Response:  The total amount of money that Magasin Razorback received from selling t-shirts and hoodies is given by the equation: $76x + $204y = Total Revenue Where x is the number of t-shirts sold and y is the number of hoodies sold. Since they sold 158 football shirts and 2 tank tops, we can plug these values into the equation as follows: $76(158) + $204(2) = Total Revenue To find out how much money Magasin Razorback earned from selling t-shirts, we need to subtract the cost price of each t-shirt from its selling price: $76(158) - $20 = $3980 Therefore, Magasin Razorback earned $3980 from selling t-shirts.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from both t-shirts and hoodies is $210 + $240 = $450. Since they sold 177 football jerseys and 23 hoodies during the game, we can calculate the revenue from each item as follows: Revenue from football jerseys = Number of football jerseys sold x Price per football jersey = 177 x $240 = $43,890 Revenue from hoodies = Number of hoodies sold x Price per hoodie = 23 x $240 = $5,620 Therefore, the difference between the price of a hoodie and a football jersey is: Difference = Revenue from hoodies - Revenue from football jerseys = $5,620 - $43,890 = $38,270 So, the price of a hoodie is $38.27 more than the price of a football jersey.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts and hoodies is $115 + $25 = $140. Since they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 hoodies, we can calculate the cost per item as follows: Cost per t-shirt = Total revenue / Number of t-shirts = $140 / 113 = $1.26 per t-shirt Cost per hoodie = Total revenue / Number of hoodies = $140 / 78 = $1.85 per hoodie Now, to find out how much more expensive a t-shirt is than a hoodie, we need to subtract the cost per hoodie from the cost per t-shirt: Difference between t-shirt and hoodie prices = Cost per t-shirt - Cost per hoodie = $1.26 - $1.85 = -$0.59 (Note: The negative sign indicates that t-shirts are cheaper than hoodies.) Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, a football jersey costs $1.26 less than a hoodie.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. However, we are told that there are more stools than tables, so the total number of stools must be greater than 50. Therefore, there are at least 51 stools in total.
Response:  We know that there are 12 stools in total and they are divided equally between two tables (or compotes). So each table has 6 stools. Therefore, the number of stools at each table is 6.
Response:  We know that there are 9 stools in the backyard and each set of tables has 3 stools. Therefore, we can deduce that there are 9 / 3 = 3 sets of tables. So, they have 3 sets of tables with 3 stools each, totaling 9 stools.
"Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is:

11 x 13 = 143

So, there are 143 chairs in their backyard."
Response:  We know that there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs (or stools). So, in total, there are 10 x 6 = 60 stools. If 11 people sit on them, then we have to subtract 11 from 60, which gives us 49 remaining stools. Therefore, 49 stools remain unoccupied.
"Response:  We know that they have 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is:

12 x 14 = 168 chairs

Now we are told that there are 6 extra chairs. So, the total number of chairs for guests is:

168 + 6 = 174 chairs

Therefore, there are 174 chairs available for guests at the party."
Response:  They have 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs. So, they have in total 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. If there will be 14 people at the party, then they need additional 2 chairs (14 - 12). Therefore, they need to buy 2 more chairs.
"Response:  If they have 9 sets of tables and chairs, then each set contains x stools and y tables (where x + y = 9). Since there are 14 seats for each table, we can write:
x + y = 14... (1)
Now, let's solve equation (1):
x = 7 (since y = 9 - x)
So, there are 7 stools more than tables."
"Response:  If Lewis earned $460 in total for 5 weeks of harvesting, he earns this amount per week:
$460 / 5 weeks = $92 per week"
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned $1216 during harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks of work he had as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
So, Lewis worked for 78 weeks during the harvest season."
Response:  Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, he has earned a total of $4,592 ($21 x 216) during that time. If he is required to pay an tax of $702, then his remaining balance after taxes will be: $4,592 - $702 = $3,890. So, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $3,890 in his account.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks during the harvest season, his total income for that period is:
$1357 x 223 = $296,813
Now, if he works for 73 additional seasons at the same rate, his total income will be:
$296,813 x 73 = $6,043,533
Therefore, Lewis will have earned a total of $6,043,533 working for 73 additional seasons after the initial 223-week harvest season."
Response:  Lewis earns $28 per week during the harvest season and works overtime for an additional $939 per week. So his total weekly income is $28 + $939 = $967 per week. Since there are 109 weeks in a year, his annual income from working during the harvest season would be $967 x 109 = $105,430.
Response:  Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, he has earned a total of $87,615 ($403 x 233) during the harvest season. However, he must pay $49 in rent every week, so his total income after paying rent is $87,566 ($87,615 - $49).
Response:  Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, he has earned a total of $472,084 during his entire farming career (1359 x $368). If he pays $388 in rent each week, then he will have paid a total of $535,376 in rent over the course of his farming career ($472,084 + $535,376 = $997,460).
"Response:  Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks of harvesting. If he pays $216 in rent each week, then his total rent paid over those 1181 weeks is:
$216 x 1181 = $250,361
So at the end of the season, Lewis will have:
$491 x 1181 = $579,711
Therefore, he will have $250,361 left after paying rent for the entire season."
Response:  We know that Lewis has been working for 19 weeks and earned $133 in total. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide his total earnings by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest time. So, if he earned a total of $178, it means he worked for 89 weeks (since $178 / $2 = 89).
Response:  The depth of water is 10 times greater than Dino's height, so if Dino is 9 feet tall, then the depth of water is 90 feet (10 x 9). Since Dino is standing in the water, his head must be below the surface of the water to some extent. So, we can say that the distance from the top of Dino's head to the bottom of the water is equal to the depth of the water minus his height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 90 feet - 9 feet = 81 feet deeper than Dino's height.
Response:  We know that Ron is at a depth of 14 feet and Din is 8 feet below him. So, if we draw a line from Ron to Din, it will be at an angle of 8 feet downward relative to the horizontal line connecting them. Now, let's find out how much water there is between Ron and the bottom of the pool. Since the water level is constant, we can assume that the volume of water in the pool is equal to the volume of water between Ron and the bottom of the pool. Therefore, we need to calculate this volume. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length x width x height. In our case, the length (L) is equal to the distance between Ron and the bottom of the pool (which we are assuming to be 8 feet), the width (W) is equal to the distance between Ron and Din (which we calculated earlier as 8 feet), and the height (H) is equal to the depth of the water (which we assumed to be 2 times the height of Din). Substituting these values into the formula, we get V = L x W x H = 8 x 8 x 2 = 64 cubic feet. Finally, since we want to find out how deep the water is between Ron and the bottom of the pool, we divide the volume of water by the area of the cross-sectional surface of the pool at that point. This gives us the average depth of the water between Ron and the bottom of the pool, which is 64 / (π x (8 + 8)) = approximately 9.5 feet.
Response:  We know that Dylan is 11 feet below Ron in water. So if Ron stands at 12 feet tall, then Dylan must be at 12 - 11 = 1 foot above the surface of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water is equal to 1 + (5 x 5) = 7 times the height of Ron.
Response:  We know that Dina is 4 feet tall and Ron is 13 feet tall. So, if we assume that the water is deep enough for Din to stand in it with her head above water level, then the depth of the water would be equal to the height of Ron minus the height of Din (or 13 - 4 = 9 feet). Therefore, the depth of the water was 9 feet.
Response:  We know that Ding is 9 feet taller than Ron and the water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height. So if Ron is 13 feet tall, then Ding is 13 x 16 = 208 feet tall. Therefore, the depth of the water was 208 - 13 = 195 feet.
Response:  The height of Ron is 15 feet = 4.5 meters (since 1 foot = 0.3048 meters). And DIn's height is 6 feet = 1.8288 meters (since 1 foot = 0.3048 meters). So, the difference in their heights is: 4.5 - 1.8 = 2.7 meters. Now, we are told that the depth of water is 9 times Ron's height, so: 2.7 x 9 = 24.3 meters. Therefore, the depth of water was 24.3 meters.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and they are evenly distributed across two bookshelves, then each shelf must have 17 books (34 / 2 = 17).
Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf holds 2 books, then there are 42 / 2 = 21 shelves. Therefore, he has 21 shelves.
Response:  We know that Brian has 27 books and 80 journals in total. Since he has 23 bookshelves, each shelf can hold 27/23 = 1.1 x 23 = 25 books. So, Brian has 27 + 25 = 52 books altogether.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book takes up one shelf space, then he has 9 shelf spaces for his books. Since he also has 46 journals per shelf, he has a total of 426 journals (9 x 46 = 426). So, there are 426 journals in total that Brian owns.
Response:  If Brian has 23 books and each book is in one of his 29 bookshelves, then he has 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, if he has 61 journals and each journal is in one of his 29 bookshelves, then he has 61 x 29 = 1809 journals. Therefore, Brian has a total of 647 + 1809 = 2456 items in his bookshelves.
Response:  We know that Brian has 7 bookshelves and each shelf has an equal number of books. Therefore, we can write the equation: 7x = 28, where x is the number of books on each shelf. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. So, there are 4 books on each of Brian's 7 bookshelves.
"Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then...

Step 1: Count the number of bookshelves Brian has.
Number of bookshelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 38 books / 2 books per shelf
= 19 bookshelves

Therefore, Brian has 19 bookshelves."
"Response:  If Kэroл wants to invite 10 friends to her birthday party and each pack of invitations contains 2 invitations, then she will need:

10 friends x 2 invitations per friend = 20 invitations in total
So, Kэroл will need 5 packs of invitations (20 / 4 = 5)."
"Response:  Since Carol sent invitations to 12 friends and she bought 3 packages of equal size, then the number of invitations in each package is:

Number of invitations per package = Total number of invitations / Number of packages
= 12 friends x 3 packages
= 36 invitations
Therefore, there are 36 invitations in each package."
Response:  If Kэroл bought 7 packs of invitations and each pack contains 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Now, if she sends only two friends an invitation, then she will have 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left.
Response:  Carol bought 6 packs of invitations with each containing 14 invitations, so she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she also bought additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number to 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends to her birthday party.
Response:  If Kэroл bought 2 packs of invitations and each pack contains 3 invitations, then she has in total 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To invite 9 friends, she needs additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played n games, then her total score is 12n. Since she scored only 36 points, we know that n = 36 / 12 = 3 games. So, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  Melissa played 3 games and scored an equal number of points in each game. So, she scored x points in Game 1, y points in Game 2, and z points in Game 3. Since she scored the same amount of points in each game, we can write the equation: x = y = z. Now, we know that the total number of points Melissa scored is 81, so we can set up the equation: x + y +z = 81. Solving for x, y, and z, we get: x = 27, y = 27, and z = 27. Therefore, Melissa scored 27 points in each game.
Response:  Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points in each game. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can use the formula: Total score = Points scored in games + Bonus points. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 109 x 79 + 82 = 6,538 + 82 = 6,456. Therefore, Melissa scored 6,456 points in 79 games.
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 21 points and played some games. If she scored 7 points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: 

Total score = Number of games x Score per game

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

21 = (Number of games) x 7

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for the number of games:

3 = Number of games

Therefore, Melissa played 3 games."
Response:  Melissa scored an equal number of points in each game, so she must have scored $x$ points in each game. Since there were 13 games in total, we can write the equation: $\text{Total score} = x + x +... + x$, where $x$ is the score in each game. We are given that Melissa scored a total of 91 points, so we can substitute this value into the equation: $\text{Total score} = x + x +... + x$. Solving for $x$, we get: $x = \frac{\text{Total score}}{13}$. Plugging in the value $x = \frac{91}{13}$, we get the final answer: Melissa scored 7 points in each game.
"Response:  If the Ferris wheel in the park ""Rayskiy"" has 4 seats and can accommodate 20 people at once, then each seat can accommodate 5 people (20 / 4 = 5)."
"Response:  If there are n seats in the Ferris wheel and it can accommodate m people at once, then we have the following equation:
n = m × 9 (since each seat can hold 9 people)
Now, if 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously, then we have:
m = 18 / 9 (since each person takes up 9/9 = 1 seat)
So, there are n = 18 / 9 = 2 seats available in the Ferris wheel."
"Response:  We know that each coaster in the park has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. To find out how many people can ride the coasters at once, we need to multiply the number of seats by the number of people who can fit in each seat. So, if there are 20 coasters in total, we can calculate the maximum capacity as follows:
Maximum capacity = Number of seats x Number of people per seat
= 19 x 15
= 285
Therefore, up to 285 people can ride the coasters simultaneously in Park ""Rayskii""."
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 of these seats are broken, then we have 18 - 10 = 8 working seats left. Therefore, at most 8 x 15 = 120 people can simultaneously ride the Ferris wheel.
Response:  The wheel has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people, so in total it can carry 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since there are already 16 people on the wheel, we can add another 80 people (84 - 16).
Response:  We know that there are 2 small places and 23 large places in the Ferris wheel park. Each small place can accommodate 14 people, so together they can accommodate 28 people (2 x 14 = 28). Now we need to find out how many people can fit on the big places. Since each big place can accommodate 54 people, the total number of people who can go on the Ferris wheel is equal to the number of big places minus the number of small places, which is 23 - 28 = -5 people. Therefore, the answer is -5.
Response:  We know that there are 7 big places and each of them can accommodate 12 people, so the total number of people who can go on the Ferris wheel in big places is 7 x 12 = 84 people. Now we need to subtract the number of small places from the total number of people who can go on the Ferris wheel. There are 3 small places and each of them can accommodate 16 people, so the total number of people who can go on the Ferris wheel in small places is 3 x 16 = 48 people. Therefore, the final answer is 84 - 48 = 36 people.
"Response:  If there are 16 people who can simultaneously ride the Ferris wheel in the park ""Rayskii Park"", then each place on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 16/4 = 4 people. Therefore, each place on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 4 people."
Response:  If there are 4 people who want to ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, then each seat on the Ferris wheel will have 4/1 = 4 passengers. Therefore, there are 4 seats on the Ferris wheel in total.
Response:  If we ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of slices, then there are 7 x 14 = 98 slices in total. So, if there were 14 slices in each pizza, then each pizza would have 98 / 14 = 7 slices.
"Response:  If each pizza has 2 slices and we ordered several pizzas, then...

Step 1: How many slices are in one pizza?
Answer: 2 slices/pizza x Total number of pizzas = Total number of slices

Step 2: How many total slices did we order?
Answer: Total number of slices = Number of pizzas x Number of slices per pizza

So, if we ordered 28 cups (or slices) of pizza, and each pizza has 2 slices, then we must have ordered 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas!"
Response:  We ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, we need to calculate how many slices of pizza there are in total: 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. Since there are 25 people, they will get 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices of pizza per person.
Response:  We ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If there are two of us, we will get 45 slices in total (9 x 10 = 90). So, each person will get 22.5 slices (45 / 2 = 22.5).
Response:  We know that Peyge helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted some seeds in 45 flower beds. Since each flower bed contains 10 seeds, we can write an equation as follows: Number of seeds = 45 flower beds x 10 seeds/flower bed = 450 seeds. Therefore, Peyge and her mother planted 450 seeds.
Response:  If Peyge helped her mom plant flowers and they put an equal number of seeds in each clump, then the number of seeds they planted in each clump is the same as the number of clumps they planted. So if they planted 9 clumps, they planted 9 x (equal number of seeds) = 9x seeds total.
Response:  We know that Peyge helped her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. Since only 58 seeds turned into flowers in each cluster, we can write an equation: 58 = x, where x is the number of clusters. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 58: x = 36 / 58. So there were 36 clusters in total.
"Response:  We know that Peyge helped her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. Since only 60 seeds germinated into flowers in each bed, we can say that:
Number of beds = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds that germinated
= 55 / 60
= 9
Therefore, Peyge and her mom planted 9 beds with flowers."
Response:  We know that Peyge helped her mother plant flowers and they put 10 seeds in each clump. So, if they planted a total of 60 seeds, then there must be 6 clumps (6 x 10 = 60).
Response:  We know that Peyge helped her mom plant flowers in 8 gardens. If they planted an equal number of seeds in each garden, then the total number of seeds they planted is 8 times the number of gardens. Since there are 32 seeds in each packet, we can write the equation: 8x = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So, Peyge and her mom planted 4 seeds in each of the 8 gardens.
Response:  Mэтью had some crackers and he gave each of his 11 friends 2 crackers each. So, the total number of crackers given away is: 2 x 11 = 22 crackers. Therefore, the number of crackers left with Matthew is: 22 - 22 = 0 crackers.
"Response:  If Mэтью had 8 creamers to give away, and he gave each of his friends 2 creamers, then...

1. How many friends did Mэтью have initially? (Since he had 8 creamers)
2. How many creamers did Mэтью give away in total? (Since he gave each friend 2 creamers)
3. Therefore, how many friends received creamers from Mэтью?

Let's solve these questions one by one:

1. Initial number of friends = Number of creamers / Number of creamers per friend
= 8 / 2
= 4 friends

So, Mэтью had 4 friends initially.

2. Total number of creamers given away = Number of creamers given away per friend x Number of friends
= 2 x 4
= 8 creamers

Mэтью gave away 8 creamers in total.

3. Friends who received creamers = Total number of creamers given away / Number of creamers per friend
= 8 / 2
= 4 friends

Therefore, 4 friends received creamers from Mэтью."
Response:  Matthew had 15 crackers and gave an equal number to each of his 5 friends. So he gave away 15 x 5 = 75 crackers. Now he has 15 - 75 = -60 crackers left. Since Matthew cannot have negative crackers, there must be some mistake in the problem. Therefore, none of his friends can have eaten any crackers.
Response:  Mэтью had 24 creamers and gave an equal number to his 3 friends. So he gave 8 creamers to each friend (since 24 / 3 = 8). Now, Mэтью has 17 creamers left, which means he gave away 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 creamers in total.
Response:  Matthew had 22 creamers and 34 pies. If he gave an equal number of creamers and pies to his 11 friends, then each friend got x creamers and y pies, where x + y = 22 (the total number of creamers Matthew had). Since there are 34 pies in total, each friend got z pies, where z = 34 - y (since y is the number of pies each friend got from Matthew). Now we can solve for y and z using the two equations: x + y = 22... (1) 34 - y = z... (2) Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get 2x + y = 34... (3) Solving for y, we get y = 7 (since 2x = 20, and 34 - 7 = 27). So each friend got 7 pies from Matthew. As for the creamers, since Matthew had 22 creamers initially, and he gave an equal number to his 11 friends, each friend got x creamers, where x = 22 / 11 = 2 creamers per person.
Response:  Mэтью had 29 creamers and 30 pies. If he gave an equal number of creamers and pies to his two friends, then each friend received 14 (half of 29) creamers and 15 (half of 30) pies. So, if Matthew gave one pie to each of his friends, how many pies did each person eat? Each person ate 15 pies.
"Response:  Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 pies. If he gave an equal number of crackers and pies to his 7 friends, then each friend got... See full solution

Response:  Matthew gave an equal number of cookies to his 18 friends. So, he divided the total number of cookies (36) by 18. Therefore, each friend got 2 creamers (36/18 = 2).
Response:  Matthew gave each of his friends 6 peanuts. If he had 36 peanuts in total, then he must have given 36 / 6 = 6 peanuts to each friend. So, 3 friends received peanuts.
Response:  Matthew had 23 creamers initially and divided them equally among his two friends. So, each friend got an equal number of creamers. If Matthew had x creamers initially, then he gave away x/2 creamers to his friends. After giving away these creamers, Matthew had (23 - x/2) creamers left. Since there are only three possible values for x (0, 11, or 23), we can use elimination to find the solution. For example, if x = 0, then Matthew had no creamers initially, so he couldn't have given any away, and he would have been left with all 23 creamers. But that's not what the problem states. Similarly, if x = 11, then Matthew would have been left with 14 creamers after giving away 11/2 creamers. That doesn't match the information provided in the problem either. Therefore, the only possible value of x is 23. So, Matthew had 23 creamers initially, and he gave away none to his friends.
Response:  Mэтью had 31 creamers and gave an equal number to his 5 friends. So he gave away 31 / 5 = 6 creamers to each friend. Therefore, after giving them away, he has 31 - 6 x 5 = 23 creamers left.
Response:  Matthew gave an equal number of cookies and pies to his four friends. So, if he had initially 32 cookies and 98 pies, then the total number of cookies given away is 32 x 4 = 128. Similarly, the total number of pies given away is 98 x 4 = 392. Therefore, each friend got 128 / 4 = 32 cookies and 392 / 4 = 98 pies.
Response:  Matthew gave an equal number of cookies and pies to his four friends. If he initially had 10 cookies and 8 pies, then the total number of cookies and pies he had was 10 + 8 = 18. Since each friend got an equal amount, the number of cookies or pies each friend received is also 18 / 4 = 4.5 per person (since you can't have a half pie). So, each friend ate 4.5 pies.
Response:  Matthew gave an equal number of cookies and tarts to his 28 friends. So, if he initially had 13 cookies and 15 tarts, then he must have given each friend x cookies and y tarts, where x + y = 28 (since he has 28 friends). Now we can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method in linear equations. For example, using substitution method, we get: x = 13/28 = 1/4 and y = 15/28 = 1/3. Therefore, each person got 1/4 creekers and 1/3 tarts.
Response:  Debbi bought several bottles of water when they were on sale. She drank 109 bottles per day. If she had enough bottles for 74 days, then...
Response:  Debbi bought 153 bottles of water when they were discounted. If she drank an equal number of bottles each day, then...
Response:  Debby bought 264 bottles of water and she drinks 15 bottles per day for 11 days. So, we need to calculate how many bottles she drank in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of days by the number of bottles she drank each day: 11 days x 15 bottles/day = 165 bottles (drunk). Since Debby had 264 bottles initially, that means she has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left.
Response:  We know that Debbi bought 301 bottles of water at a discount and drank 144 bottles per day for several days. To find out how many days she drank water, we can use the following equation: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption  Number of days = 301 / 144 = 2  Therefore, Debbi drank water for 2 days.
Response:  Debbi bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda at a discount. If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, how many days will it last her? We can start with the total amount of liquid she has: Total = 88 + 13 = 101 bottles. Since she drinks 4 bottles of water per day, that means she uses up 4 x 25 = 100 bottles of water in one month (since there are 25 bottles in each month). So, the number of days it will last her is: Number of days = Total - Used = 101 - 100 = 1 day. Therefore, it will last her for one day.
Response:  Debbi bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda at a discount. If she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day, how many days will it last her? We can start with the total amount of soda that Debbi has: 256 bottles. Since she drinks 4 bottles per day, in one day she consumes: 256 / 4 = 64 bottles of soda. So, in X days (where X is the number of days that Debbi has left of soda), she will consume: 64 bottles/day x X = Total amount of soda remaining After X days, which we want to find out. To do this, we need to subtract the total amount of soda consumed from the initial amount of soda that Debbi had: Total amount of soda remaining after X days = Initial amount of soda - Amount of soda consumed in X days Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Initial amount of soda = 256 bottles Consumed amount of soda per day = 64 bottles/day Time period = X days Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: Total amount of soda remaining after X days = 256 - (64 x X) Now, we want to find out how long it will take for Debbi to finish all the soda she has. To do this, we divide the total amount of soda remaining by the daily consumption rate: Number of days until Debbi finishes all the soda = Total amount of soda remaining / Daily consumption rate = (256 - (64 x X)) / 64 = X / 64 Now, let's solve for X: X / 64 = X Solving for X, we get: X = 10 days Therefore, Debbi will finish all the soda she has in 10 days.
Response:  Debby drinks 6 bottles of water per day. If she bought only 12 bottles of water, then she will run out of water in 2 days (12 / 6 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2 days.
"Response:  We know that Debbi bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water at a discount. If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days it will last her as follows:

Days = (Total amount of water / Daily consumption of water) + (Total amount of soda / Daily consumption of soda) - 1

In this case, Total amount of water = 180 bottles = 180 x 0.033 liters/bottle = 6.2 liters
Daily consumption of water = 15 bottles = 15 x 0.033 liters/bottle = 0.495 liters

So, Days = (6.2 liters / 0.495 liters/day) + (95 bottles / 54 bottles/day) - 1 = 17.6 days
Therefore, Debbi has enough water to last for approximately 17.6 days based on her daily consumption rate."
Response:  Debbi bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water at a discount. If she drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, how many days will last her supply of soda? We can start by dividing the total number of bottles of soda that Debbi has by the number of bottles she drinks per day: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day = 360 / 131 = 275 days So, it will last Debbi approximately 275 days to finish her supply of soda.
Response:  We know that Fey placed her crayons in 14 rows with 11 crayons each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of crayons as follows: Total number of crayons = Number of rows x Number of crayons per row = 14 x 11 = 154 crayons So, Fey has 154 crayons.
"Response:  We know that Fey placed 12 carandashes in total and divided them into 3 rows. So, we can write an equation:
Number of carandashes in each row = Total number of carandashes / Number of rows
We are given that Fey placed 12 carandashes in total, so let's substitute this value into the equation:
Number of carandashes in each row = 12 / 3
Now, let's simplify the equation:
Number of carandashes in each row = 4
So, Fey placed 4 carandashes in each row."
Response:  We know that Fey had 28 packages of chalk and each package contained 24 chalk sticks. Therefore, in total, she had 28 x 24 = 672 chalk sticks. Since she wanted to place them in rows, we can divide this number by the number of rows she could make (which is equal to the number of chalk sticks divided by the number of chalk sticks in each row). So, if she wants to make n rows, then the number of chalk sticks in each row is 672 / n. Now, since there are 16 chalk sticks in each row, we can find out how many rows she could make by dividing 672 by 16: 672 / 16 = 43. So, Fey could make 43 rows of chalk sticks.
"Response:  We know that Fey has 6 packs of chalk and each pack contains 14 chalk pieces. Therefore, the total number of chalk pieces owned by Fey is:

6 packs x 14 chalk pieces/pack = 84 chalk pieces
So, Fey has 84 chalk pieces in total."
Response:  We know that Fey had 35 kandandas in total and 7 of them were colored. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of kandandas = Number of rows x Number of kandandas per row. In this case, we have: Total number of kandandas = 35 / (5 + 1) = 35/6 = 5.83... Therefore, Fey could make 6 rows with her 35 kandandas.
Response:  Fey has 19 rows of 4 chalkboards each, so she has 19 x 4 = 76 chalkboards in total. Since there are 27 chalkboards in each row, Fey has 76 / 27 = 2.85 chalkboards in total. Therefore, Fey has 2 chalkboards more than 2.85 chalkboards. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Fey has placed her crayons in 7 rows and each row contains 36 or 30 crayons (depending on the row). Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information as follows: Number of crayons = Total number of rows x Number of crayons per row So, if there are 36 crayons in each row, then the total number of crayons is: Number of crayons = 7 x 36 = 248 If there are 30 crayons in each row, then the total number of crayons is: Number of crayons = 7 x 30 = 210 Therefore, the answer to the question is either 248 or 210, depending on whether there are 36 or 30 crayons in each row respectively.
"Response:  We know that Fey has placed her pencils in 11 rows and each row contains 31 pencils and 27 pencils. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of pencils = Number of rows x (Number of pencils in each row)
= 11 x (31 + 27)
= 11 x 58
= 609
So, there are 609 pencils in total."
Response:  We know that Fey had 30 kandradyshes to place in rows. Since each row can have up to 5 kandradyshes, we can make at most 6 rows (since 30 / 5 = 6). Therefore, Fey could make 6 rows of kandradyshes.
Response:  If Fey had 6 carandashes in total and placed them equally in two rows, then she must have placed 3 carandashes in each row. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Fey had 35 packs of crayons and each pack contained 4 crayons. Therefore, in total, she had 35 x 4 = 140 crayons. Since she wanted to arrange them in rows, we can assume that she arranged all 140 crayons in rows. So, there were 140 / 2 = 70 rows of crayons.
Response:  Fey has 31 packs of pencils, each containing 6 pencils. So she has 31 x 6 = 186 pencils in total. Since she wants to arrange them in rows with 19 pencils in each row, she will have 186 / 19 = 9 complete rows. Therefore, Fey has 9 x 19 = 171 pencils left after arranging them in rows.
"Response:  Fey has 30 rows of her colored pencils and each row contains 71 colored pencils. Therefore, the total number of colored pencils that Fey has is:

30 rows x 71 pencils/row = 2130 pencils
So, Fey has 2130 colored pencils in total."
"Response:  Fey has placed her colored pencils and regular pencils in 16 rows, with each row containing 6 colorful pencils and 21 regular pencils. Therefore, the total number of colorful pencils is:

6 x 16 = 96

So, there are 96 colorful pencils in total."
Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in the school and 98 students. If all 7 school buses are full, then the number of students who can be accommodated per bus is 98 / 7 = 14. So, each bus has 14 seats.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in school and each class has 30 students (as per the assumption). So, the total number of students in school is:

84 x 30 = 2520

Therefore, there are 2520 students in the school."
Response:  We have: Number of classes = 67 Classes per bus = 6 Students per class = 66 Total number of students = 66 x 67 = 4120 Now we need to determine how many buses are needed for the excursion. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus: Bus capacity = 6 students/bus Total number of students / Bus capacity = 4120 / 6 = 683 buses Therefore, we will need 683 buses for the excursion.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in school and each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, we can assume that there are 87 x 58 = 4960 students in total. Since each student needs two seats in the bus, we need at least 4960 / 2 = 2480 buses to accommodate all the students. So, the answer is 2480 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in school and each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, we can write: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class. Now, we need to find out how many students are in one class. To do this, we divide the total number of students (which is given as 120) by the number of classes (which is also given as 24): Number of students per class = Total number of students / Number of classes. Substituting these values into our first equation gives us: Number of students per class = 120 / 24 = 5. So, there are 5 students in each class. Finally, since there are 84 seats on each bus, we can calculate the number of buses needed for all the students to fit by dividing the total number of students by the number of seats per bus: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus. In this case, Number of buses = 120 / 84 = 3/4 or 0.75 buses.
Response:  We have: Number of classes = 66 Classes per bus = 8 Students per bus = 102 / 8 = 13 students/bus Total number of students who want to go on the excursion = 22 students who do not want to go on the excursion = 64 students Total number of buses needed = Total number of students divided by total number of students per bus = 64 / 13 = 5 buses
"Response:  We have 102 classes in school and 11 students who want to go on an excursion. If we divide the number of students going on the excursion by the number of buses available (99), we get:

Number of students per bus = 11 / 99 = 0.1111... or approximately 11 students per bus.
Therefore, 11 students will be sent on the excursion."
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students (on average). So, we have:
Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class
= 72 x 3
= 216 students
Now, we need to find out how many buses will be needed for the excursion. Since each bus can accommodate 3 students, we can divide the total number of students by 3 to get the number of buses required:
Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus
= 216 / 3
= 72 buses
Therefore, 72 buses will be needed for the excursion."
Response:  We know that there are 17 classes in school and 46 autobuses. If all autobuses are full, then the number of students who can go on the excursion is equal to the total number of places available in all autobuses divided by the number of autobuses. Therefore, we have: Number of places = Total number of places / Number of autobuses = 92 (students) / 46 (autobuses) = 2 So, there will be 2 students per bus if all autobuses are full.
Response:  If there are 11 boys in class Haley and each boy gets 9 marbles, then the total number of marbles distributed is 9 x 11 = 99 marbles. So, Haley had 99 marbles initially.
Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and she gives each of the boys 5 marbles, then how many marbles does each boy get? So, there are 4 boys in total who will receive marbles from Haley. Therefore, the number of marbles each boy gets is 4/4 = 1.
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, then she will have 9 marbles left after giving some to each of the boys. Since there are 4 boys in total, if we divide 9 marbles equally among them, each boy will get 2.25 marbles (since you can't have a fraction of a marble). So, the answer is 2 mraimors per boy.
Response:  We know that there are 13 boys who like to play marbles and 50 boys who like to play cards. If Haley has 26 marbles in total, then each boy will get an equal number of marbles. Therefore, the answer is 26/13 = 2 marbles per boy.
Response:  If Hayley has 20 glass marbles and she distributes them equally among two boys, each boy will get 10 marbles (since 20 / 2 = 10).
Response:  If Haley had 28 mramors and gave each boy 2 marbles, then she would have given out a total of 28/2 = 14 marbles. So, 14 boys received marbles.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for x days. Since he read 14 pages per day, the total number of pages he read is 392 x = 5680 pages. So, it took him x = 5680 / 14 = 405 days to finish reading the book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days and he reads 22 pages per day. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages per day Now, we are given that Frank read 22 pages per day, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Number of days = Total number of pages / 22 Therefore, if we know the total number of pages in the book, we can solve for it using the above equation. For example, if the total number of pages in the book is x, then we can calculate the number of days Frank took to read it as follows: Number of days = x / 22 Substituting x with the information provided in the question (569 days), we get: Number of days = 569 / 22 = 25.73 pages per day Now, since Frank read 22 pages per day, we can conclude that there were approximately 25.73 pages in each day s worth of reading. Since Frank read for 569 days, the total number of pages in the book is: Total number of pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day = 569 x 25.73 = 14085 pages In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, the total number of pages in Frank's favorite book is approximately 14085 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 6 days and it had 612 pages in total. Since there are 24 chapters in the book, each chapter has 25 pages (612 / 24 = 25). So, Frank read 25 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 220 days and there were 555 pages in total. Since each chapter has an equal number of pages (5 chapters x 555 pages = 2775 pages), we can calculate how many pages Frank read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total pages / Number of days taken to finish reading
= 2775 pages / 220 days
= 12.4 pages/day
Therefore, each chapter had approximately 12.4 pages."
Response:  We know that Fank read his favorite book for 660 days and there are 193 pages in the book. Since each page has an equal number of pages (15 chapters), we can assume that each chapter is approximately 12.8 pages long (193 / 15 = 12.8). Therefore, Frank read one chapter per day. So, he read 15 chapters or 12.8 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read several books and each book had 249 pages. So, if he reads x books in 3 days, then he will have read a total of x \* 249 pages in those 3 days. To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we can divide the total number of pages he read by the time it took him to read them: x \* 249 pages / 3 days = x pages/day. Therefore, Frank read 76 pages per day (x = 76).
Response:  We know that Frank read several books and each book had 66 pages. Therefore, he needed 12 days to finish reading one book. To find out how many books he read in total, we can use the following formula: Number of books = Total time taken / Time taken per book. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of books = 492 days / 12 days/book = 40 books. So, Frank read 40 books.
Response:  We know that Frank took 16 days to finish his favorite book and there were 112 pages in it. So, he read at most $pages per day$. Therefore, we can write an inequality as follows: $\$pages \leq 16$. Solving for $\$, we get $\$ = 16$. Thus, Frank read $16$ pages per day.
"Response:  If Frank read 8 pages per day and there were 576 pages in total, he would need to read for:

576 / 8 = 72 days
Therefore, Franks needed 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 30 days and each chapter had 450 pages. Therefore, he read 30 x 450 = 13,500 pages in total. So, he read 13,500 / 30 = 450 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book and it had three chapters, each containing 594 pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, in this case, we have: Number of days = 607 days Total number of pages = 3 x 594 pages per chapter = 1782 pages Now, let's substitute these values into our equation: Number of days = 1782 pages / 3 chapters x 594 pages per chapter = 1782 pages / 3 x 594 = 594 pages per chapter Therefore, there are 594 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 664 days and each chapter had 405 pages. Therefore, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Number of chapters = Total number of chapters / Number of days taken to finish reading the book
= 2 x 405 (pages in each chapter) / 664 (days taken to finish reading the book)
= 81 x 405 / 664
= 307.5 chapters/day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 307.5 chapters every day during those 664 days."
"Response:  If we have 6 packages of DVDs and they cost $120 in total, then each package costs:
$120 / 6 = $20 per package
Therefore, each package of DVDs costs $20."
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then the cost of 33 packages would be:
$81 x 33 = $2693
So, the cost of purchasing 33 packages of DVDs would be $2693."
"Response:  If each pack of DVD costs $107, then we have:
$107 = x (since there are n packages)
Now, if we apply the discount of $106 to each package, we get:
$106x = $107n
Solving for n, we get:
n = $\frac{106}{107}$
So, the number of packages that can be bought for $93 is:
$$\boxed{\text{93} \times \frac{106}{107} = 92}$$"
Response:  The cost of each DVD packaging is $76. If there is a discount of $25 for each packaging, then we need to calculate how much we will pay for each packaging after applying the discount. So, the amount we will pay for each packaging = $76 - ($76 x 25%) = $76 - $19 = $57. Therefore, you will have to pay $57 for each packaging.
Response:  We have $104 to spend. If we divide it by the cost of each package ($26), we can buy... (divide) $104 / $26 = 4 packages. So, we can buy 4 packages of DVDs with $104.
Response:  If we have $28 to spend and we want to buy 2 packages of DVD disks, then each package must cost at least $14 (since $28 / 2 = $14). Therefore, each package costs $14.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in total. If we organize them into groups of 2 each, then...

Group 1: Banana 1 and Banana 2
Group 2: Banana 3 and Banana 4
Group 3: Banana 5 and Banana 6
...and so on until Group 17 (Banana 17 and Banana 18).
Therefore, there will be 9 groups of bananas."
"Response:  We know that there are several bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of 140 groups with 187 bananas each. Therefore, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is:
Total number of bananas = Number of groups x Number of bananas per group
= 140 x 187
= 23,600 bananas
So, there are 23,600 banans in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and 63 oranges. If we organize the bananas into groups of 7, then each group will contain 203/7 = 29 bananas. Therefore, the size of each group of bananas is 29 bananas. Similarly, if we organize the oranges into groups of 95, then each group will contain 63/95 = 0.66 oranges (since you can't have a fraction of an orange). So, the size of each group of oranges is 0.66 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in Philip's collection. If we organize the bananas into groups of 47, then each group will contain 47/142 = 0.33 (or approximately 1/3) of the total number of bananas. Similarly, if we organize the oranges into groups of 178, then each group will contain 178/356 = 0.5 (or approximately half) of the total number of oranges. Therefore, the size of each group of oranges is 5.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's collection of bananas and he has 392 bananas altogether. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group. In this case, we have: Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2 Therefore, each group contains 2 bananas.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group and we have to find out how many groups of bananas we have in total. So, if we divide the number of bananas (180) by the number of bananas per group (18), we get:

180 / 18 = 10 groups

So, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are organized into two groups. So, we have 290 / 2 = 145 bananas in each group. Now, let's consider the apples. There are 87 apples and they are divided into 93 groups. Therefore, the number of apples in each group is 87 / 93 = 0.92 (or approximately 1 apple per group).
Response:  We know that there are 384 apples and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. Since the bananas are organized into groups of 345, we can say that each group contains 345/345 = 1 banana. Therefore, the size of each group of apples is 16 / 1 = 16 groups of apples. So, the size of each group of apples is 16.
"Response:  If Brandy's mom made 38 pieces of gingerbread and each piece contains 19 pieces, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gingerbread that Brandy's mom made:

"Response:  If Brandy's mom made 22 pieces of gingerbread for 5 people and had to throw away 17 pieces, then each person got how many pieces of gingerbread?
We know that the total number of pieces of gingerbread is 22, and there are 5 people. So, if we divide 22 by 5, we get the number of pieces of gingerbread per person:
$$ \frac{22}{5} = 4 $$
So, each person got 4 pieces of gingerbread."
Response:  If MaMa Brandy prepared 18 pieces of gingerbread for 10 guests and 9 guests did not come, then each guest received how many pieces of gingerbread? We know that 9 guests did not come, so the total number of guests is 10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, each guest received 18 / 1 = 18 pieces of gingerbread.
"Response:  If Brandy's mom made 14 pancakes for 2 guests and each guest received an equal amount of pancakes, then...

Let x be the number of pancakes each guest received. Since there are 2 guests, the total number of pancakes is 2x.
Since Brandy's mom made 14 pancakes in total, the number of pancakes she gave to each guest is 14 / 2 = 7.
So, each guest received 7 pancakes."
"Response:  If MaMa Brandy prepared 10 pieces of gingerbread for guests and each guest received 2 pieces, then...

Step 1: How many guests did MaMa Brandy invite?
Number of guests = Number of pieces of gingerbread / Number of pieces per guest
= 10 / 2
= 5 guests

Therefore, MaMa Brandy invited 5 guests to share her homemade gingerbread."
Response:  If Frank had 42 pieces of candy and he divided them equally among two bags, then each bag would contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy.
"Response:  If Frank had some number of candies and divided them into 26 packages with 33 candies in each package, then...

1. The total number of candies = Number of packages x Number of candies per package
= 26 x 33
= 878

So, Frank had 878 candies initially."
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 candies initially and he lost 24 of them. So, he has 33 - 24 = 9 remaining candies. If he puts these candies in packets of 9 each, then he will have 9 / 9 = 1 packet left over. Therefore, there will be 1 packet of candies left with Frank.
"Response:  If Frank has 22 candies and he wants to divide them equally among 5 packages of 11 each, then we can calculate the number of packages as follows:

Number of packages = Total number of candies / Number of candies in each package
= 22 / 11
= 2
Therefore, Frank will have 2 packages of 11 candies each."
Response:  If Frank has 16 confections and he wants to divide them equally among two packages, then each package will contain 8 confections (16 / 2 = 8).
"Response:  We know that Shirley sold 25 boxes of treacle. Since each box contains 14 packets of treacle, we need to divide 25 by 14 to find out how many boxes she needs to deliver:

$$ \therefore 25 / 14 = 3 $$
So, Shirley needs to deliver 3 boxes of treacle."
"Response:  We know that Shirley sold 10 boxes of treacle (Trefoyl). If there are x boxes in each container, then we need to deliver 5 containers with boxes. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5
Now, we have to solve for x. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 5:
x = 5 / 5 = 1
So, there is one box in each container. Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 5 jars with boxes."
Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in total. So we can write an equation as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of regular bottles + Number of diet bottles. In this case, the total number of bottles is equal to 67 + 9 = 76. Therefore, the number of regular bottles was greater than the number of dietary bottles by 67 - 9 = 58.
"Response:  The number of ordinary gasoline bottles is 22, and the number of dietary gasoline bottles is 61. So we can write this as follows:

Number of ordinary gasoline bottles = 22
Number of dietary gasoline bottles = 61 - 22 = 39

Therefore, there are 39 more dietary gasoline bottles than ordinary gasoline bottles."
Response:  The total number of bottles in the store is 30 + 8 = 38. So there were altogether 38 bottles in the store.
Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of ordinary soda and 53 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of ordinary bottles + Number of diet bottles. In this case, the total number of bottles is equal to 79 + 53 = 132. Therefore, the number of ordinary bottles was greater than the number of dietary bottles by 132 - 53 = 80.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of dietary soda and 83 bottles of regular soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of dietary soda + Number of regular soda. 
Total number of bottles = 54 + 83 = 137. 
So, there were more than 100 bottles of regular soda (137 - 54 = 83). Therefore, the answer is 83."
Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles in total and 9 of them were regular ginger ale bottles. So, the number of diet ginger ale bottles is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, there were 8 bottles of diet ginger ale at the store.
Response:  The number of ordinary gasoline bottles is 60, and the number of dietary gasoline bottles is 19. To find out how many more ordinary gasoline bottles there are than dietary gasoline bottles, we need to subtract the number of dietary gasoline bottles from the number of ordinary gasoline bottles: 60 - 19 = 41. Therefore, there are 41 more ordinary gasoline bottles than dietary gasoline bottles at the store.
Response:  We know that there are 72 ordinary soda bottles and 32 dietary soda bottles in total. There are also 78 apples. So we can write an equation based on this information as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of ordinary soda bottles + Number of dietary soda bottles = 72 + 32 = 104. Now let's divide the total number of bottles by the number of apples to find out how many more bottles than apples: Number of bottles per apple = Total number of bottles / Number of apples = 104 / 78 = 1.35. Therefore, there are 1.35 times more bottles than apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 jablons and 80 bottles of ordinary soda water. So, we have:
Jablons = 36
Bottles of soda water = 80
Now, let's find out how many bottles of diet soda water there are:
Diet soda water = 54
So, now we can calculate the difference between the number of jablons and the number of bottles of diet soda water:
Difference = Jablons - Diet soda water = 36 - 54 = -18
Therefore, there are 18 fewer bottles than jablons in the store."
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were regular soda bottles. So, the number of diet soda bottles is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, there were 2 diet soda bottles at the store.
Response:  We know that there were 4 bottles of diet soda and they had 79 more bottles of regular soda than usual. So, if we assume that the number of bottles of regular soda is x, then we can write an equation as follows: 4 + 79x = 153 (since there are 153 total bottles). Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution.
"Response:  The total number of bottles is given as follows:
Total Number of Bottles = Number of Ordinary Soda Bottles + Number of Dietetic Soda Bottles + Number of Light Soda Bottles
= 57 + 26 + 27
= 100
Therefore, there were 100 bottles in total at the store."
"Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of ordinary soda and 60 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write this as follows:

Total number of bottles = 81 + 60 = 141
Now, let's find out how many bottles of diet soda there are:
Number of diet soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of ordinary soda bottles
= 141 - 81
= 60
So, there are 60 more bottles of diet soda than ordinary soda. To summarize, the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 81, and the number of bottles of diet soda is 60. Therefore, the difference between these two quantities is 21 (81 - 60)."
Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of ordinary soda and 40 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of ordinary soda + Number of diet soda. In this case, the total number of bottles is equal to 49 + 40 = 89. Therefore, there were 89 bottles of both ordinary and diet soda combined.
"Response:  If in the previous day there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace and after they ate a hearty meal they went to see it, then in that day there were 317 visitors. So, the difference between the number of visitors in the two days is:

317 - 295 = 22
Therefore, 22 more people visited Buckingham Palace in the second day than in the first day."
"Response:  If in one day (yesterday) there were 246 visitors to Buckingham Palace, and after they had dinner, they went to see it, then in 25 days (if we assume that they visited every day) there will be:

Number of visitors = Number of days x Number of visitors per day
= 25 x 246
= 6,150

Therefore, the number of people who visited Buckingham Palace over the past 25 days is 6,150."
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the previous day and then 666 visitors came in that day, then the difference between the two days is 334 (100 - 666). So, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in that day was 334 more than in the previous day.
Response:  We know that after they had eaten their hearty meal, they went to Buckingham Palace. Rachel found out that on that day, 132 visitors came to Buckingham Palace. If in the last 327 days, Buckingham Palace has received 406 visitors per day, how many visitors did it receive on the previous day? Answer: To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors who came on the day Rachel and her friends visited from the total number of visitors in the last 327 days. So, let's do that: 406 - 132 = 274 visitors per day. Therefore, on the previous day, Buckingham Palace received 274 visitors.
Response:  We know that after they had eaten their hearty meal, they went to Buckingham Palace. Rachel found out that in the previous day, 45 visitors came to Buckingham Palace. Now we want to find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace on that particular day. So, if in the last 85 days, Buckingham Palace received 829 visitors, then the number of visitors who came to Buckingham Palace on that particular day is equal to 829 - 45 = 784. Therefore, the answer is 784.
Response:  We know that in one day (yesterday), there were 188 visitors to Buckingham Palace. If we multiply this number by 57 days, we get 10,460 visitors for the entire period of time (57 days).
Response:  If in the previous day there were 600 visitors to Buckingham Palace and after they had eaten a hearty meal, they went to see it again, then the number of visitors that day will be greater than 600. So, if Rachele learned that 661 people visited the palace that day, we can conclude that the difference between the number of visitors that day and the number of visitors the previous day is equal to 661 - 600 = 61. Therefore, the number of visitors who came to Buckingham Palace that day was 661.
Response:  We know that in the previous day there were 419 visitors and yesterday (the day before) there were 103 visitors. So, the total number of visitors until now is: 419 + 103 = 522 visitors. Now we are told that after they had their heavy meal, they went to Buckingham Palace and found out that today there were 92 visitors. Therefore, the total number of visitors since the last time Raechel visited Buckingham Palace is: 522 - 92 = 430 visitors.
"Response:  We know that in the last 89 days, there were 3 consecutive days with different numbers of visitors to Buckingham Palace: 
* Day 1: 808 visitors
* Day 2: 471 visitors
* Day 3 (the day after Raechel and her friends visited): 512 visitors
We can represent this information as follows:
Day 1: 808
Day 2: 471
Day 3: 512
To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace over the last 89 days, we need to add up all these numbers:
808 + 471 + 512 = 1891
So, during the last 89 days, Buckingham Palace was visited by 1891 people."
"Response:  On day 1 (yesterday), there were 191 visitors to Buckingham Palace. On day 2 (today), Racheal found out that 705 people visited the palace today. So, the difference between the number of visitors on day 2 and day 1 is:

705 - 191 = 514

Therefore, in total, 514 more people visited Buckingham Palace today than during the previous 245 days."
Response:  We know that he needs 159 g of wax to glue the feathers together and we want to find out how much wax he already has. So, let X be the amount of wax he already has (in grams). According to the problem, if the feathers require 628 g of wax in total, then the amount of wax he already has is equal to 628 - 159 = 469 g. Therefore, the answer is 469 g.
"Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of paint to color the feathers and he has already used 260 grams of wax. So, the amount of wax left with him is:

260 - 49 = 211 grams
Therefore, he still has 211 grams of wax left."
"Response:  We know that he needs 57 g of paint to color the feathers and 22 g of wax for gluing them together. If the total weight of the feathers is 353 g, then we can calculate how much wax he already has as follows:

Total weight of feathers = 353 g
Weight of paint needed = 57 g
Weight of wax needed = 22 g

So, if he needs 57 g of paint and 22 g of wax, and the total weight of the feathers is 353 g, then he must have had 318 g of wax before (353 - 57 - 22 = 318)."
Response:  We know that he needs 166 grams of wax to glue all the feathers together. Currently, he has 20 grams of wax. So, we need to find out how many times 20 grams is divided by 166 grams. To do this, we can divide 20 grams by 166 grams using basic arithmetic: 20 / 166 = 0.125. Therefore, he still needs 83 more grams of wax (166 - 0.125 = 83).
"Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required is 17 g and the current amount of wax available is 557 g. To find out how much wax is needed for the feathers, we can divide the required amount (17 g) by the remaining amount of wax (540 g). So, the number of grams of wax needed for the feathers is:

17 g / 540 g = 0.031 g
Therefore, the answer is 0.031 g or 31 mg."
"Response:  We know that he has 11 g of wax and needs 492 g for feathers. To find out how much more wax he needs, we can divide the amount needed (492 g) by the amount he already has (11 g):

492 g / 11 g = 44 g

So, he still needs 44 grams of wax."
Response:  If they will fill 90 barrels in 6 days, then they will fill 15 barrels per day (90 / 6 = 15).
Response:  If there are 266 collectors and they will fill 90 barrels of wine in 5 days, then each day they will fill 18 barrels (90 / 5 = 18).
Response:  If there are 294 collectors who fill 244 barrels of grapes per day and 47 barrels of blackberries per day, then in one day they will fill 244 + 47 = 301 barrels. Therefore, in 146 days (or 146 x 244 = 35,844) they will fill 301 barrels / day \* 146 days = 46,564 barrels of grapes. 
"Response:  If 235 collectors gather 100 barrels of blackberry juice per day and 221 collectors gather 100 barrels of grape juice per day, then in total, they will gather 
$$ \text {Total number of barrels gathered} = \text {Number of collectors} \times \text{Amount of juice collected per day} $$
= $235 \times 100$
= $23500$ barrels per day
Now, if it takes $77$ days to harvest all the grapes, then the total number of barrels of grape juice gathered is:
$$ \text {Total number of barrels gathered} = \text {Number of days} \times \text {Total number of barrels gathered per day} $$
= $77 \times 221$
= $16477$ barrels
Therefore, the total number of barrels of grape juice gathered over $77$ days is $16477$ barrels."
Response:  If he visited the vineyards after 57 stops and 252 collectors filled 108 barrels per day, then in total, they will fill 58 * 108 = 6048 barrels of wine during 58 days.
Response:  If there are 36 collectors who fill 8 barrels of grapes per day, it means that in one day they will fill 36 x 8 = 288 barrels. To fill 240 barrels, it will take 240 / 288 = 81 days. Therefore, the answer is 81 days.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium has an equal number of marine animals. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Number of marine animals in one aquarium = Total number of marine animals / Number of aquariums

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of marine animals in one aquarium = 52 / 26 = 2

So, there are 2 marine animals in each aquarium."
Response:  We know that there were 40 marine animals in total and each aquarium had 2 animals. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of marine animals / Number of marine animals per aquarium. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
"Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 39 animals. Therefore, the total number of marine animals is:

56 x 39 = 2274

So, there are 2274 marine animals in Tauler's collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 46 animals. Therefore, the total number of marine animals is:

22 x 46 = 980

So, there are 980 marine animals in Tauler's collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 19 animals, so...

Step-by-step solution:
Let's count the number of aquariums for marine animals first:
15 x 19 = 285 (animals in marine aquariums)
Now let's count the number of aquariums for freshwater animals:
62 x 19 = 1174 (animals in freshwater aquariums)
So, in total, there are 285 + 1174 = 1459 animals in all the aquariums."
Response:  If white football shirts are sold in packs of 13 each, then...
"Response:  If Мама buys 66 white football shirts and each pack contains 3 white football shirts, then...

1. How many packages will she have if she buys 66 white football shirts?

Answer: 66 / 3 = 22 packages (rounded up to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, Мама will have 22 packages of white football shirts."
"Response:  If there are 28 packages and each package contains 56 white football shirts, then the total number of white football shirts is:

28 packages x 56 football shirts/package = 1492 football shirts
Therefore, there are 1492 white football shirts in total."
"Response:  If we buy 57 packs of white football shirts, then the total number of white football shirts is:
57 x 53 = 2910
So, if Mama buys 34 pairs of shorts along with these football shirts, the total number of white football shirts she will have is:
2910 - 34 = 2876
Therefore, Mama will have 2876 white football shirts in total."
"Response:  If MaMa buys 51 white football jerseys and each pack contains 3 jerseys, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many packs of football jerseys MaMa can buy with 51 jerseys.
Number of packs = Total number of jerseys / Number of jerseys in a pack
= 51 / 3
= 17 packs

So, there will be 17 packs of white football jerseys that MaMa can buy."
Response:  We know that Mama buys a total of 70 white football jerseys. If she buys them in packages, and she buys 14 packages, then we can assume that each package contains how many football jerseys? So, let x be the number of football jerseys in each package. Then, we have the equation: 70 = 14x. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 14: x = 70/14. Therefore, there are 5 football jerseys in each package (70/14).
Response:  If you have 4 sundries with an equal number of peanuts and a total of 36 peanuts, then each sundry must contain 9 peanuts (36 / 4 = 9).
"Response:  If you had 33 peanuts and each package contains 11 peanuts, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many packages of peanuts you have.
Number of packages = Total number of peanuts / Number of peanuts in each package
= 33 / 11
= 3 packages

Therefore, you have 3 packages of peanuts."
Response:  If there are 41 pieces of gingerbread in each package and you have 53 packages of gingerbread, then the total number of pieces of gingerbread is: 53 x 41 = 2193. So, there will be 2193 pieces of gingerbread at your disposal.
Response:  We have 14 peanuts in total and we know that each pack contains an equal number of peanuts as there are in the total amount. So, if we divide the total number of peanuts by the number of packets, we get the number of peanuts in each packet: 14 / 7 = 2 peanuts per package. Therefore, each package contains 2 peanuts.
Response:  If there are 3 peanuts in each package and you have a total of 21 peanuts, then you must have had x packages where x is the number of packages that contain 3 peanuts each. Since you have 21 peanuts in total, we can write the equation: 3x = 21. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. Therefore, you have 7 packages containing 3 peanuts each.
Response:  We know that there were 26 packages with an equal number of cookies and candies. If we had 15 sweets and only 52 pieces of candy, then each package contained 3 pieces of candy (since 52 / 26 = 3). So, there were 26/3 = 8 packages of candy.
Response:  We have 14 sundries with an equal number of peanuts. If we had 28 peanuts and 86 candies in total, then each bag contained 5 peanuts (28 / 14 = 5). So there were 14 bags of peanuts.
Response:  The postman has to deliver 5 unwanted letters per quarter, and he delivers 25 letters to each house in a quarter. So, if there are x houses in one quarter, then the number of unwanted letters he has to deliver is 5x/4. Therefore, the number of houses in one quarter is 4x/5.
Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each block and the postman needs to deliver 9 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, we need to calculate how many pieces of unwanted mail he will have to deliver overall. So, the total number of pieces of unwanted mail that the postman has to deliver is: 20 x 9 = 180 pieces of unwanted mail.
Response:  There are 6 houses in total, and each house will receive 24 pieces of advertising mail. Therefore, the total number of pieces of advertising mail that the postman needs to deliver is 6 x 24 = 144.
Response:  If there are n houses in a block and the postman wants to give each house 2 advertising letters, then he will have to deliver a total of 2n advertising letters. So, we can write an equation as follows: 2n = 14 (since the postman has 14 advertising letters to distribute). Now, we need to find the value of n. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: n = 14 / 2 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 houses in the block.
"Response:  If there are 20 homes in one quarter and the postman needs to deliver 32 pieces of advertising mail to each home in each quarter, then the total number of pieces of advertising mail that the postman will need to deliver is:

20 homes x 32 pieces per home = 640 pieces of advertising mail
So, the postman will need to deliver 640 pieces of advertising mail in each quarter."
Response:  The postman has to deliver 30 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 78 blocks. Since there are 19 houses in each block, he will give 30 x 19 = 570 pieces of unwanted mail in total.
Response:  The postman has to deliver 8 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he delivers 32 letters to each house in a block, then there are 55 houses in one block. Therefore, there are 55 x 8 = 440 houses in total.
"Response:  Since there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses, the number of reclam letters that the postman needs to deliver is:

81 x 12 = 972

So, the postman needs to deliver 972 advertising letters in total."
Response:  The postman needs to give 4 pieces of advertising mail to each house in each block. Since there are 16 blocks, he will need to deliver 4 x 16 = 64 pieces of advertising mail altogether.
Response:  We need to divide the mramor into groups of 4. So we will have 5 groups (since 4 x 5 = 20). Therefore, there will be 5 groups.
Response:  We need to divide the total number of eggs (15) into groups of 5 each. So we will create 3 groups. Therefore, the answer is 3.
"Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide her egg collection into groups of 11 eggs each, and there are x eggs in total, then we can write an equation as follows:
x / 11 = number_of_groups
Now, let's solve for x:
x = (number_of_groups \* 11)
So, if Rebecca has 50 eggs, for example, we can calculate that she wants to divide them into 4 groups of 11 eggs each:
Rebecca has 50 eggs → x = (4 \* 11) = 44 eggs
Therefore, the answer is 44 eggs."
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide her eggs into 4 groups. Since she has 8 eggs in total, each group will have 2 eggs (8 / 4 = 2). Now, we need to decide how many marbles Rebecca has and how they should be distributed among the groups. According to the question, Rebecca has 6 marbles. Since there are 4 groups, each group will get 1 marble (6 / 4 = 1). So, each group will have 2 eggs and 1 marble.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide her collection of eggs into 3 groups. Since she has 4 marbles and 15 eggs, we can start by dividing the eggs equally among the 4 marbles. So each marble will have 3-1/2 eggs (15 / 4 = 3-1/2). Now let's divide these eggs into 3 groups: Group 1 - 3-1/2 eggs; Group 2 - 3-1/2 eggs; Group 3 - 3-1/2 eggs. Therefore, there will be 3 eggs in each group."
Response:  We need to divide the total number of items into groups of 6. So, we will create 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 groups. Therefore, there will be 18 groups.
Response:  We need to divide the total number of items into groups of size 3. So, we will create 33 groups (since 99 / 3 = 33). Now, let's count how many items are in each group: Group 1 has 9 bananas + 9 eggs + 2 mramors = 20 items. Therefore, there will be 33 groups.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of 5. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with her total number of eggs and marbles.
We have 20 eggs and 6 marbles. To make 5 groups of eggs, we will need at least 10 eggs (since each group needs 5 eggs). Therefore, we have:
Number of eggs = Total number of eggs - Number of groups needed for eggs
= 20 - 10
= 10
So, Rebecca has 10 more eggs than marbles."
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide her eggs into groups of 20. She has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. So, we can start with 5 marbles and 12 eggs = 17 (marbles) + 12 (eggs). Now, let's subtract the number of marbles from the total number of objects: 17 + 12 - 5 = 24. Therefore, there are 24 eggs left after dividing them into groups of 20.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and he got 11 points in each round, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of rounds = Total score / Score per round So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of rounds = 154 / 11 = 14 rounds Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds of the game.
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds in the game and received 46 points for each round, then he got a total of:

177 rounds x 46 points/round = 8,322 points
So, Luke scored 8,322 points in the game."
Response:  If Luke got an equal number of points in each round, then he must have scored x points in the first round and x points in the second round. Since he has 84 points overall, we can write the equation: x + x = 84. Solving for x, we get: x = 42. So, Luke scored 42 points in each round.
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of the game, then he would have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,322 points in the entire game. Therefore, the correct answer is 21,322.
Response:  If Luke earned 3 points in each round of the game and he played n rounds, then his total score is 3n. Since he scored 78 points, we can set up the equation 3n = 78. Now, we need to solve for n. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 3: n = 78 / 3 = 26. So, Luke played 26 rounds of the game.
Response:  Emily made beaded necklaces for her friends using two beads. She could make 32 necklaces with these two beads. Therefore, each necklace requires 16 beads (32 / 2 = 16).
"Response:  If Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace requires 28 beads, then the total number of beads used by Emily is:

11 necklaces x 28 beads/necklace = 308 beads

Therefore, there were 308 beads used by Emily."
Response:  We know that Emily has 16 beads and needs 8 beads for each necklace. Therefore, she can make 2 (16 / 8) = 3 necklaces.
Response:  Emily made 18 beaded necklaces for her friends. Since she had 6 beads in total, each necklace required 3 beads (since 18 / 6 = 3). Therefore, there are 3 beads per necklace.
Response:  Emily made 4 oversized necklaces and each one requires 5 beads. So, she had to make 4 x 5 = 20 beads in total.

Answer: Let's think step by step. Emily can make 72 / 6 = 12 oжерелий with 6 beads each, for a total of 72 beads."
Response:  Emily has 5 beads and wants to make 20 necklaces for her 43 friends. To calculate how many beads are needed per necklace, we can divide the total number of beads (5) by the number of necklaces (20): 5 / 20 = 0.25 bead/necklace. So, each necklace requires approximately 0.25 beads.
Response:  Emily made 26 oversized pearl necklaces for her 44 friends. Since each necklace requires two pearls, we can calculate how many pearls Emily had as follows: Number of pearls = Total number of necklaces x Number of pearls per necklace = 26 x 2 = 52 pearls So, Emily had 52 pearls in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children in total from the district of Lawrence. Of these, 668278 children stayed at home during summer vacation, which means that 150780 children went to camp. Therefore, more children spent their summer vacations at camp than those who stayed at home.
"Response:  We know that there are 100% of children who go to camp (i.e., 202958) and 33.33% of children who stay at home (i.e., 777622). So, we can calculate the difference as follows:

Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp
= 777622 - 202958
= 574664
Therefore, there are 574664 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898,051 children in the county of Lawrence. During summer vacation, 629,424 children go to camp, leaving 268,627 children at home. Therefore, 268,627 children remain at home.
"Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in the county of Lawrence. During summer vacation, 274865 children stay at home while the rest go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children go to camp. To do this, we divide the number of children who stay at home (274865) by the total number of children (313473): Number of children going to camp = Number of children staying at home / Total number of children = 274865 / 313473 = 8709
Therefore, 8709 children go to camp during summer vacation in Lawrence County."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, during summer vacation, 907611 children from the district of Lawrence stay at home, while 455682 children go to camp. So, the number of children in the district of Lawrence is: 907611 + 455682 = 1363293 children.
"Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 8000 children from Lawrence County go to camp and 828521 are the total number of children in the county. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of children who went to camp = 8000
Total number of children in the county = 828521 - 8000 = 748521
Number of children who remained at home = Total number of children in the county - Number of children who went to camp = 748521 - 8000 = 668521
Therefore, approximately 668521 children remained at home during the summer vacation."
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 61619 children from Lawrence County stayed at home, while the remaining 30057 went to camp. So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is 91676. Therefore, approximately 34% (or 30057/91676) of the children from Lawrence County went to camp.
Response:  We know that 34044 children from Lawrence County go to camp and 134867 stay home, so together they are 47511 (34044 + 134867). Now we need to add the number of children who come from other counties, which is 424944. Therefore, the total number of children who visited the camp is 47511 + 424944 = 470055.
"Response:  We know that in total there are 610769 children who go to camp during summer vacation, and 590796 of them stay at home. So, we have:

610769 - 590796 = 198873

Therefore, approximately 198873 children are from the county of Lawrence."
Response:  We know that in total there are 644997 children from Lawrence County who stayed at home during summer vacation. Additionally, we know that 893835 children from Lawrence County went to camp. So, the number of children from Lawrence County is: 644997 + 893835 = 732832.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie and that Adam has 9 apples in total. So, if Adam has x apples more than Jackie, then Jackie has x/2 apples. Since Adam has 9 apples, we can write the equation: x + (x/2) = 9. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 18. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 9. Therefore, Jackie has 9 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. In this case, 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So, we can say that Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples owned by Jackie and Adam is 1. Hence, Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jeff has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jeff has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jeff has: 10 - 8 = 2. So, Jeff has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together. If he has more than them together, then he must have at least 2 apples more than them. So, his total number of apples is 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, he has 8 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 7 jacks. So, if Adam has x jacks, then Jackie has 7 - x jacks. Now we are told that Adam has more than 9 jacks combined with Jackie. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (7 - x) = 9. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 9. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us x = 4.5. Since we cannot have a half jack, we must round up to 5 jacks for Adam. Therefore, the answer is 5 jacks.
Response:  We know that together Adam and Jack have 12 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the total number of apples, we will get the number of apples that Jack has. Therefore, the number of apples that Jack has is: 12 - 8 = 4.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 4 apples and together with Jackie they have 2 apples. So, Adam must have at least 5 apples. Moreover, we are told that Jackie has 10 apples, so in total they have 12 apples (5 + 7). Therefore, Adam has 5 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 5 apples and less than or equal to 10 apples. So, we can say that Adam has at least 6 apples (since he has 5 more than Jeff). Now, let's check if this is possible based on the information given in the problem: According to the problem, Jeff has 89 apples and 11 jacks. If Adam has 6 apples, then Jeff must have 84 apples (since he has 89 - 11 = 78 apples left). But this is impossible since we were told earlier that Jeff has exactly 89 apples! Therefore, we conclude that Adam must have exactly 10 apples (since he cannot have fewer than 6 apples and more than 10 apples).
Response:  Yesterday (the day before), Helen prepared 31 pies. Today, she prepared 270 pies in the morning and 419 pies last night. So, the total number of pies Helen prepared until now is: 31 + 270 + 419 = 650 pies.
Response:  Yesterday, Елена made 90 pechenies with chocolate drops. Today, she made 51 pechenie with hazelnut and 484 pechenies with chocolate drops. So, in total, Елена made 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 pechenies with chocolate drops.
Response:  Yesterday, Елена испекла 527 печеньев с шоколадными каплями and 86 печеньев with honey. Today, she also made 86 pechenyas with honey and 554 pechenyas with chocolate drops. So, in total, Елена made 527 + 86 = 613 pechenyas with chocolate drops.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 144 bread rolls with chocolate drops and 397 bread rolls with honey. Today, she baked 85 bread rolls with honey and 403 bread rolls with chocolate drops. So, the number of bread rolls with honey that Helen baked is 85 + 403 = 488. Therefore, the number of bread rolls with honey that Helen baked is 488.
Response:  Yesterday, Elena baked 19 peanut butter cookies with chocolate drops. Today, she baked 237 peanut butter cookies without chocolate drops. So, the number of peanut butter cookies Elena baked with chocolate drops is greater than the number of peanut butter cookies she baked without chocolate drops. Therefore, the answer is 237 - 19 = 218.
Response:  Yesterday, Elena baked 197 peanut butter cookies and today she baked 75 peanut butter cookies. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 122 peanut butter cookies (197 - 75 = 122).
Response:  Yesterday, Elena baked 280 peanut butter cookies and 300 peanut butter cookies with chocolate drops, for a total of 580 peanut butter cookies. Today, she baked 280 peanut butter cookies and 359 peanut butter cookies with chocolate drops, for a total of 649 peanut butter cookies. So, yesterday Elena baked more peanut butter cookies than today.
Response:  We know that Katy has 81 games for Nintendo DS and her friends have 59 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 81 = x + y (where x is the number of games her friends have). Now, we are given that Katy's friends have 59 games, so we can substitute this value in the equation: 81 = x + 59. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 22. Therefore, Katy has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  Katy has 91 games for Nintendo DS and her new friends have 88 games together. So, if we add these numbers, we get: 91 + 88 = 179. Therefore, all of Katy's friends together have 179 games.
Response:  Katy has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  Katy has 84 new games and her friends have 8 new games, so together they have 92 new games (84 + 8). Now, let's find out how many old games Katy has and her friends have. According to the question, Katy has 19 old games, and her friends have 69 old games. So, together they have 88 old games (19 + 69). Therefore, the total number of games that Katy and her friends have together is 92 (new) + 88 (old) = 180 games.
Response:  Katy has 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 142 games (62 + 80). Her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so they have a total of 114 games (73 + 41). Therefore, there are 28 more games that Katy has than her friends (142 - 114 = 28). So, the number of old games that Katy's friends have is 28.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Katy had 57 games for Nintendo DS and her friends had 63 games for Nintendo DS. So, we can write an equation as follows: 57 = x + y (where x is the number of games that Katy's friends have). Now, we are told that Katy has more games than her friends, so we can say that x > 57. Therefore, the difference between the number of games that Katy's friends have and the number of games that Katy has is greater than 57. In other words, the answer is: x - 57 > 0.
Response:  Katy had 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Her friends have 34 new games, which means they have a total of 34 games as well. Therefore, Katy has more games than her friends, specifically 96 - 34 = 62 more games.
Response:  We know that Fred had $60 last week and Jason had $19. Now, after Jason washed the car, he has $33 more than before, so his new amount is $33 + $19 = $52. Therefore, Jason earned $52 by washing the car.
Response:  Fred had $86 last week and now he has $9 + $5 = $14 more dollars, so he has $86 + $14 = $100 total. Jason didn't work, so he still has $5. Therefore, together they have $100 + $5 = $105.
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 last week and now he has $40. So, he earned an additional $21 during the past week. Similarly, we know that Jason had $16 last week and now he has $69. So, he earned an additional $53 during the past week. Therefore, Fred earned $21 more than Jason during the past week.
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 last week and now he has $21 + $7 = $98. So, his total amount of money is $98. Now, we know that Jason started with $22 and earned $78 during the weekend, so his new amount of money is $22 + $78 = $100. Therefore, Jason earned $36 more than Fred during the weekend.
Response:  Fred had $111 last week and now he has $115 after working as a car washer for 4 days. So, he earned $4 ($115 - $111) more than last week. Similarly, Jason had $40 last week and now he has $44, so he earned $4 ($40 - $36) more than last week. Therefore, the total amount of money they both earned from washing cars is $7 ($4 + $4).
Response:  Fred had $49 last week and now he has $112 after working as a car washer. So, his earnings from car washing are $63 ($112 - $49). Now, let's calculate Jason's earnings from delivering newspapers. Last week, he had $3, and now he has $63 ($63 + $3 = $66). Therefore, they both earned $63 each from their respective jobs.
Response:  At first, Fred had $78 and Jason had $31. Then, Jason spent $25 on something (we don't know what) and now has $6 ($31 - $25). Now, they both went to work as newspaper sellers and earned $14 each. So, Jason has $6 + $14 = $20 and Fred has $78 - $14 = $64.
Response:  We know that Fred had $33 last week and earned $16 during the past weekend for delivering newspapers. So his new balance is $33 + $16 = $49. Then, we learn that Jason had $95 last week and did not earn any money over the weekend. Therefore, Jason still has $95. Now, let's calculate how much money Fred earned from washing cars: He earned $74 for washing 3 cars, so he earned $28 per car ($74 / 3 = $28). Since he washed 2 cars, he earned $28 x 2 = $56 in total from washing cars. So, the final amount of money Fred earned is $49 (from delivering newspapers) + $56 (from washing cars) = $105.
"Response: 
Fred had $47 last week and earned $111 in delivery work, so now he has $568 ($47 + $111). Then, he also earned $34 from washing cars, so his current amount is $602 ($568 + $34)."
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 71 kg (or 156 lbs). Then she started running every day and lost 20 kg (or 44 lbs). So now she weighs... 51 kg (or 112 lbs).
"Response:  We know that Jessie currently weighs 27 kg and after starting to run every day, she lost 101 kg. So, her weight before starting running can be calculated as follows: 
Weight before running = Current weight - Lost weight
= 27 kg - 101 kg
= -74 kg
Therefore, Jessie weighed -74 kg before starting to run every day."
Response:  We know that Jessie started running every day and lost 126 kilograms. Now she weighs 66 kilograms. So, her initial weight was 66 + 126 = 192 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie weighed 192 kilograms before starting to run daily.
Response:  We know that Jessie started running every day and lost 35 kilograms. So her weight before starting to run was 69 kilograms (since she lost 35 kilograms). Therefore, her current weight is 69 + 35 = 104 kilograms.
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 114 kg (kg). Then she lost weight at a rate of 50 g per day during the first week and another 60 g per day during the second week. So in total, she lost 50 + 60 = 110 kg over two weeks. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 114 - 110 = 4 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie started running after she gained weight and before starting to run, she weighed 9 kg. So her weight before starting to run was 9 kg. Now let's analyze the given information: After one week of running, she lost 62 kg, which means she had gained an additional weight equal to the amount she lost in one week. Therefore, her weight after one week of running is: 9 kg + (62 kg / 7 days) = 9 kg + 8.71 kg/day x 7 days = 9 kg + 59.97 kg = 68.97 kg After two weeks of running, she lost another 140 kg, which means she had gained an additional weight equal to the amount she lost in two weeks. Therefore, her weight after two weeks of running is: 68.97 kg - (140 kg / 14 days) = 68.97 kg - 10 kg/day x 14 days = 68.97 kg - 140 kg = -71.03 kg This means that Jessie actually gained weight while running! However, this is impossible since she claimed to have lost weight. Therefore, there must be some mistake or miscalculation somewhere.
Response:  After Jessie started running every day, she lost 56 kg in the first week and 99 kg in the second week. So, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kg.
Response:  We know that there were 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the enclosure. If 64 of them hide, then we have to subtract this number from the total amount of animals. So, the remaining number of zebras is: 95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, 31 zebras do not hide.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 97 alligators in the enclosure. If 40 of them hide, then we have:
Number of alligators = 97 - 40 = 57
So, out of the total number of alligators (97), 40 are hiding, leaving 57 non-hiding alligators."
Response:  We know that in the zoo enclosure there were initially 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators hide, then we can conclude that 75 - 82 = 9 alligators do not hide. Therefore, 9 alligators do not hide.
"Response:  We know that there were 24 snakes and 51 alligators in total. If 24 of them (all snakes) hid, then the number of animals left visible is: 51 - 24 = 27 alligators. Since we are told that ""the overall number of animals in the cage was 79,"" this means that the remaining 27 alligators plus any other animals (either zebras or giraffes) make up the total number of animals in the cage. Therefore, the answer to your question is 27 + x, where x represents the number of other animals in the cage (zebras or giraffes)."
"Response:  The farmer had initially 171 tomatoes in his garden. If he collected 134 of them yesterday and 30 today, then the total number of tomatoes he has now is:

171 - 134 + 30 = 265

So, after today, there will be 265 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden."
"Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden initially. If he collected 56 of them yesterday and 41 today, then the total number of tomatoes left after yesterday's collection is:

160 - 56 = 104

So, there are 104 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden after both collections."
"Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden to start with. If he collected 154 yesterday and 50 today, then the total number of tomatoes he has collected is:

154 + 50 = 204

So, the farmer has collected a total of 204 tomatoes."
Response:  We know that initially there were 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in the farmer's garden. If he collected 172 potatoes, then we can calculate how many tomatoes are left as follows: Number of tomatoes = Initial number of tomatoes - Collected potatoes = 175 - 172 = 3 Therefore, the farmer has 3 tomatoes left in his garden.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in the farmer's garden. If he collected 53 tomatoes, then we can write an equation based on this information:

Tomatoes = Initial amount - Collected amount
= 177 - 53
= 124

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are left in the garden. Since we know that initially there were 12 potatoes, and the farmer collected none of them, so the number of potatoes remaining is still 12. Therefore, the final answer to your question is:

Tomatoes = 124
Potatoes = 12"
Response:  We know that there were initially 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in the farmer's garden. If he collected 137 tomatoes altogether, then we can calculate how many tomatoes he had of each color separately: Number of green tomatoes = Initial amount - Amount collected = 105 - 137 = -32 Number of red tomatoes = Initial amount - Amount collected = 71 - 137 = -66 Therefore, there are 32 green tomatoes and 66 red tomatoes left in the farmer's garden after collecting 137 tomatoes.
Response:  If John needs 4 nails to attach big wooden boards to the wall of his house, and each board requires 2 nails for attachment, then he will need... (do the calculation)...4 nails / 2 = 2 boards. So, John will need 2 big wooden boards to cover one side of his house.
Response:  We know that John needs 13 big wooden boards for his house and each board requires 17 nails to attach it to the wall. So, in total, he needs 249 nails (13 x 17 = 201). However, some of the smaller boards require additional 8 nails each, so we need to add 8 more nails to the total count. Therefore, John needs 257 nails (249 + 8) to build his house.
"Response:  We know that John used 11 nails to attach big wooden boards to the wall of his house. Each board requires 3 nails for attachment. Therefore, the total number of nails required is:

11 gvozdy = 3 x Number of boards

We are also given that John used additional 8 nails. So, the total number of nails used by John is:

Total number of nails = Number of boards x 3 + 8

Now we can substitute the values from the question into this equation:

Total number of nails = (Number of boards) x 3 + 8
= (11 gvozdy) x 3 + 8
= 33 + 8
= 41

Therefore, John needs 41 wooden boards to cover the wall of his house."
Response:  For each big board, John needs 15 gvozdy for assembly, and for each small board, he needs 5 gvozdy. Since there are 12 big boards and 10 small boards in total, we need to calculate how many gvozdy John will need altogether. So, the final answer is: 12 x 15 = 180 + 10 x 5 = 50 = 230 gvozdy.
Response:  John will use 16 doorks for the sten of his home. Each dors requires 2 gwods for creping, so he will need 16 x 2 = 32 gwods in total. Therefore, John will need 32 gwods for the sten of his home.
"Response:  Since there are 8 big wooden boards for the wall of the house, and each board requires 74 nails to be nailed onto it, we can calculate how many nails John will need as follows: Number of boards = 8; Each board needs 74 nails = 74 x 8 = 592 nails Total number of nails needed = 592 nails"
Response:  For each big board, John needs 14 gimlets for mounting, and he has to use 12 of them. So, he needs 12 x 14 = 168 gimlets for big boards alone. Now, let's consider small boards. Each small board requires 25 gimlets for mounting, and John has to use 17 of them. Therefore, he needs 17 x 25 = 425 gimlets for small boards. In total, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 gimlets for staining the wall of his house.
Response:  We know that Robin has several packages of chewing gum and each package contains 3 pieces of gum. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = Total number of pieces of gum / Number of pieces per package. In this case, the total number of pieces of gum is given as 42, and the number of pieces per package is 3. Therefore, we can solve for the number of packages as follows: Number of packages = 42 / 3 = 14 packages. So, there are 14 packages of chewing gum with Robin.
Response:  Robin has 43 packages of chewing gum with each package containing 23 pieces. So, in total, he has 43 x 23 = 1007 pieces of chewing gum. Now, we are told that Robin has 8 extra pieces of chewing gum, so the total number of pieces of chewing gum he has is 1007 + 8 = 1015 pieces. Therefore, the correct answer is 1015.
"Response:  We know that Robin has several packages of chewing gum and each package contains 7 pieces. So, if we call x the number of packages, we can write:
x × 7 = 41 (total number of pieces)
Now, we are also given that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum, so we can add them to our calculation:
x × 7 + 6 = 41
Solving for x, we get:
x = 9
So, there are 9 packages of chewing gum in total with Robin."
Response:  Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum.
Response:  Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces. So, in total, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. Similarly, he has 45 packages of candy, and each package contains 9 pieces too. Therefore, Robin has 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy.
Response:  Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 6 pieces. So, in total, Robin has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gum. Similarly, he has 14 packages of candy and each package contains 6 pieces. Therefore, Robin has 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that one industrial bench can produce 3 shirts per minute. So if we have produced 6 shirts in total, it means that the bench worked for x minutes, where x is the number of shirts produced divided by the number of shirts produced per minute. In this case, x = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the industrial bench worked for 2 minutes to produce all 6 shirts.
Response:  The industrial bench worked for 5 minutes. If it can make 4 shirts per minute, then in 5 minutes it made... (5 min \* 4 shirts/min) = 20 shirts. Therefore, the industrial bench made 20 shirts during those 5 minutes.
Response:  We know that the industrial bench made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today. If he can make 3 shirts per minute, then we need to find out how many minutes he worked yesterday. So, let's divide the number of shirts he made yesterday by the number of shirts he could make in a minute: 9 / 3 = 3 minutes. Therefore, the industrial bench worked for 3 minutes yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in total. Today, it made 3 shirts. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 10 shirts (13 - 3 = 10). If the machine can make 8 shirts per minute, then it worked for 10/8 = 1.25 minutes. Therefore, the industrial bench worked for approximately 1.25 minutes overall.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in total, and today it made 8 shirts. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 1 shirt. Since the machine can make 2 shirts per minute, we need to divide the number of shirts made today by the time it took to make them: 8 / 2 = 4 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 4 minutes today.
Response:  The industrial bench can make 3 shirts in one minute. Yesterday, it made 4 shirts, and today it made 8 shirts. So, the total time the bench worked is: 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 12 minutes and made 6 ru...
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 6 ru...
Response:  We know that they earned $165 in total over 5 days. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total amount = Daily earnings x Number of days. Now, we are asked to find out how much they earned per day. Therefore, we can substitute the value of 'Number of days' from the problem statement into the above equation and solve for 'Daily earnings': Total amount = Daily earnings x 5 $165 = Daily earnings x 5 $33 = Daily earnings $6.60 Thus, they earned $6.60 per day playing the Ring Toss game at the carnival.
"Response:  The game ""Ring Toss"" brought in $144 per day. They were at the carnival for 22 days. So, how much money did they make in total? To find this out, we need to multiply the amount of money earned per day by the number of days they were there: $144 x 22 = $3,068. Therefore, they made $3,068 during their time at the carnival."
"Response:  We know that the game ""Ring Toss"" brought in $420 over 30 days and together with other games they brought in $22 over 30 days. So, if we subtract the amount of money brought in by all other games from the total amount brought in by ""Ring Toss"", we get:
$$ Total = $420 - $22 = $398 $$
So, the game ""Ring Toss"" brought in $398 per day."
"Response:  The game earned $382 for the first 44 days and $374 for the remaining 10 days. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the game is:

$382 + $374 = $756

So, they earned a total of $756."
Response:  The game earned $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days for a total of $186. So, they earned an average of $11 per day during the first 20 days ($120 / 20 = $11).
Response:  We know that in the first 154 days of the carnival, they earned $325. To find out how much they earned per day during this period, we can divide the total amount by the number of days: $325 / 154 = $2.09 per day. Now, let's calculate how much they earned per day for the remaining 57 days of the carnival: $114 / 57 = $2.00 per day. Therefore, they earned $2.09 per day during the first 154 days and $2.00 per day during the remaining 57 days, for a total daily earnings of $4.09.
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packages of bread and 4 packages of cake. So, we have:

Bread = 10 packages
Cake = 4 packages

Now, let's find out how many packages of bread Lucy bought more than cake:

Bread - Cake = 10 - 4 = 6 packages

So, Lucy bought 6 packages of bread more than she bought cake."
Response:  Lucy bought 4 packs of bread (печень), which means she bought 4 x 8 = 32 pieces of bread. Then, she bought 22 packs of cake (торт), which means she bought 22 x 6 = 132 pieces of cake. Finally, she bought 16 packs of chocolate (шоколад), which means she bought 16 x 4 = 64 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, in total, Lucy bought 32 + 132 + 64 = 230 packages of food.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of bread and several packages of cake. So, she had at least 23 + several = total number of packages of products. Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 2 packages of bread and 12 packages of cake. Since each package contains 4 units (bread) or 8 units (cake), we can calculate the total number of units she bought as follows: Bread: 2 x 4 = 8 Cake: 12 x 8 = 96 Total number of units: 8 + 96 = 104 Now, let's check how many units are left after she made her purchase: 56 - 104 = -48 So, Lucy did not buy any products in this case.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got into the bus at the next stop. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Therefore, currently, there are 16 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got into the bus at the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people left the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people inside the bus. Therefore, there are currently 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, another 9 people got on the bus at the stop (including the person who asked the question). So, now there are 13 people in the bus. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people entered the train, so now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train.
"Response:  We know that there were 22 parents and in total, 676 people were present at the program. To find out how many students were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. Therefore, the number of students who attended the program is:

676 - 22 = 654

So, there were 654 students present at the program."
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents, 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. Therefore, we can write the equation: Parents + Students + Teachers = Total number of people in the program. Now let's solve for the total number of people: Total number of people = Number of parents + Number of students + Number of teachers = 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531 So, there were 1531 people present in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in the program. To find out how many more students than parents there are, we can subtract the number of parents from the total number of people: 521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents in the program.
"Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in total. The program could accommodate 44 people at most. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Number of people present = Maximum capacity - Number of available places
= 44 - (61 + 177) / 2
= 44 - 238 / 2
= -194

So, unfortunately, no one was present in the program as the number is negative."
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave. So, if we subtract the depth from the total distance, we get: Distance = Total distance - Depth = 1307 - 919 = 388 feet Therefore, the end of the cave is located 388 feet away from the entrance.
Response:  The distance from their current position to the end of the cave is given as $g = 1218 - 849 = 369$ feet. Since they are moving at a speed of $17$ feet per minute, it will take them $\frac{distance}{speed} = \frac{369}{17} = 21$ minutes to reach the end of the cave.
"Response:  They are currently at a depth of 659 feet and need to reach the end of the cave which is 762 feet deep. To find out how much more they have to go, we subtract the current depth from the final depth:

762 - 659 = 103 feet

So, they still have 103 feet to go until they reach the end of the cave."
Response:  We know that Peyge initially had 8 goldfish in the pond and then 6 of them were eaten by stray cats. So, the number of goldfish left in the pond is 8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, 2 golden fish disappeared or were eaten by the stray cats.
Response:  We know that Peyge had 7 goldfish and 12 salmon in the pond. If the stray cats liked them and started eating them, then we can assume that some of the fish disappeared. So, let's say that 4 goldfish (out of 7) and 3 salmon (out of 12) were eaten by the cats. Now, we have 3 goldfish and 9 salmon left in the pond. Therefore, the answer is 4 + 3 = 7 fish that disappeared.
Response:  According to the problem, Peyge had 16 goldfish and 71 somas in her pond. If without homes cats started eating them, then the number of fish that disappeared is equal to the total number of fish minus the number of fish left after the cats finished eating them. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Number of goldfish that disappeared = Total number of goldfish - Number of goldfish left after cats finished eating them. Substituting the values given in the problem into this equation, we get: Number of goldfish that disappeared = 16 - 2 = 14. So, 14 golden fish disappeared.
"Response:  We know that Peyge grew 15 goldfish in the pond and that 5 of them were eaten by stray cats. So, we have:

Goldfish left = Original number - Number eaten
= 15 - 5
= 10

Therefore, there are 10 golden fish left in the pond after the stray cats ate 5 of them."
Response:  At first, the chef had 43 jablos (jablotas). After preparing several pies, he was left with 2 jablos. So, the chef used 41 jablos to prepare the pies.
Response:  At first, Shef had 58 apples. After preparing some pies, he used 35 of them. So, how many apples did Shef have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of apples he used from the total number of apples he initially had: 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, Shef had 23 apples left after preparing some pies.
Response:  We know that initially, Shef had 40 jablocks and 54 pears. After preparing some pies, he had 39 left. So, we can write an equation as follows: 40 + 54 = x, where x is the number of jablocks used to prepare the pies. Solving for x, we get x = 6. Therefore, Shef used 6 jablocks to prepare the pies.
Response:  Adam can place 11 toy figures on each shelf in his room, so he has 11 x 4 = 44 toy figures that he can place on all four shelves. Since there are 4 shelves and 40 drawers in total, we have 44 / 4 = 11 toy figures per drawer. Therefore, the number of toy figures that Adam's shelves can hold is 11.
Response:  If Adam could place 10 toy figures in each shelf of his room and there were 8 shelves in total, then we can calculate the number of shelves as follows: Number of shelves = Total number of places for toys / Number of toys per shelf Therefore, the number of shelves is: Number of shelves = 10 (toys per shelf) x 8 (total number of shelves) = 80 Now, let's find out how many poles are in Adam's room: Poles = Number of shelves x Number of toys per pole Therefore, the number of poles in Adam's room is: Poles = 80 (shelves) x 10 (toys per pole) = 800 So, there are 800 poles in Adam's room.
Response:  Adam can put 8 toy figures and 10 boxes on each shelf in his room. Since there are 4 shelves, he can accommodate a total of 32 toy figures (8 x 4) and 40 boxes (10 x 4). Therefore, the total number of objects that Adam's shelves can hold is 72 (32 + 40).
Response:  We have 10 gardens with 544 pots in total. Each pot has 32 flowers, so we have в total of 544 x 32 = 17,688 flowers.
Response:  We have 466 pots and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 stems. Therefore, we have: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,798 flowers Number of stems = 466 x 181 = 86,066 stems
Response:  We have 141 pots and each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 stems. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total Number of Flowers = Number of Pots x Number of Flowers per Pot = 141 x 71 = 9631 flowers. So there are 9631 flowers in total.
Response:  We have 40 colors in each pot, and we have 400 total colors. Therefore, if we divide 400 by 40 (the number of colors per pot), we get the number of pots: 10. So, there are 10 pots in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 sticker sheets in Steve's collection. Since they cannot be divided evenly into groups of 154, we need to find out how many groups can fit in each container. To do this, divide the total number of items (Skittles + sticker sheets) by 154: Total = 9830 (Skittles + sticker sheets). Now, divide the total number of items by 154: Number of groups per container = Total / 154 = 63. So, each group contains approximately 63 items (Skittles or sticker sheets).
Response:  We know that there are 495 groups of lollipops and each group contains 495 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops is 495 x 495 = 248750. Similarly, we can calculate the number of Skittles as follows: Number of Skittles = Total number of candies / Number of groups of Skittles = 3941 / 495 = 79. Therefore, the size of each group of Skittles is 79.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and we want to divide them into groups of size x. Since Steve also has 517 lollipops and 90 weights, let's assume that each group contains an equal number of Skittles, lollipops, and weights. Therefore, we can write the following equation: Number of Skittles = Number of Lollipops + Number of Weights x = 896 + (517 \* x) x = 896 + 4090x Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. To do so, we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation: x = 896 / (517 + 4090) x = 896 / 4107 x = 21.36 So, if we have 896 Skittles, we can divide them into groups of approximately 21 Skittles per group.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in school and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class. In this case, we have: Number of students = 304 x 75 = 22,600 students. Therefore, there were 22,600 students in total at the school.
