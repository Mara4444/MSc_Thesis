Explanation: According to the question, it takes 10 minutes for Ryan to learn 1 Jam of Malay language and 8 minutes for him to learn 1 Jam of Chinese language. Therefore, if Ryan wants to learn 2 Jams of Malay language in 2 hours, he will need 2 x 10 minutes = 20 minutes. Similarly, if he wants to learn 2 Jams of Chinese language in 2 hours, he will need 2 x 8 minutes = 16 minutes. So, the difference between the time taken to learn 2 Jams of Malay language and that of Chinese language is 40 - 16 = 24 minutes."

Explanation: According to the question, there are 7 apples in total and each apple is cut into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of apple pieces is 7 x 5 = 35. However, since some of the apple pieces are already cooked, we need to subtract that amount from the total number of apple pieces. In this case, 3 apple pieces are already cooked, so we subtract 3 from 35 to get 32. Finally, we add 3 (the number of uncooked apple pieces) to 32 to get our final answer of 14."

Explanation:
Nell has 239 cards in total, including 38 cards of baseball and 10 other types of cards. Jeff has 376 cards in total, including 111 cards of baseball. To find out how many cards of each type Nell has, we can divide the number of cards she has by the number of cards Jeff has for that type. For example, to find out how many cards of baseball Nell has, we can divide 38 by 111 = 0.34 or approximately 34%. Similarly, to find out how many cards of non-baseball types Nell has, we can divide 10 by 376 = 0.027 or approximately 2.7%. Therefore, the ratio of cards of each type that Nell has is: Baseball: 34%, Non-Baseball: 2.7%."

Explanation:
The number of kaos sold by Toko Kaos Razorback is 87, and the price per kaos is $ 87. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling kaos during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech is:
Total amount of money earned = Number of kaos sold x Price per kaos
= 87 x $ 87
= $ 7,609
Since there were 95 kaos in total during the game, the number of kaos sold by Toko Kaos Razorback is:
Number of kaos sold = Total amount of money earned / Price per kaos
= $ 7,609 / $ 87
= 87
Therefore, the number of kaos sold by Toko Kaos Razorback during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech is 87."
"Response: 378
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 242 Kaos sold for each game of Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, the total number of Kaos sold is 242 x 2 = 484 Kaos. Since the price per pair of Kaos is $ 106, then the total amount of money earned from the sale of Kaos is 484 x $ 106 = $ 50,976."

"Response: 30
Explanation: To find out how many DVDs can be bought with a $76 discount of 25%, we need to calculate 25% of $76, which is $19. So, if the original price of each DVD was $19, then after the discount of 25%, the price would be $19 / (1 - 0.25) = $14. If you want to know how many DVDs can be bought with $76, divide $76 by $14, which gives you 5. Therefore, there are 5 DVDs that can be bought with the remaining amount of $76 after the discount of 25%."

Explanation: According to the question, Rachel has 317 friends who have visited the Buckingham Palace and she wants to know how many of them have also been to the palace's garden.

Explanation: According to the question, there are 100 windows in the palace of Buckingham, and each window has 666 panes. Therefore, the total number of panes in all the windows of the palace is 100 x 666 = 754."

"Response: 320
Explanation: According to the question, there are 71 paintings in the palace of Buckingham, and each painting has an average size of 557 square meters. Therefore, the total area of all paintings is 71 x 557 = 38,677 square meters. Since the palace has 57 rooms, the total area of all paintings per room is 38,677 / 57 = 694.6 square meters per room."
"Response: 457
Explanation: According to the question, there are 39 paintings in the palace of Buckingham. If we multiply this number by 661 (the total area of the palace), we get 258,390 square meters. Dividing this number by 600 (the number of rooms in the palace) gives us an average size of approximately 457 square meters per room."
"Response: 567
Explanation: According to the question, there are 92 windows in the palace of Buckingham and each window has 4 panes, making it a total of 368 panes of glass in the palace. Additionally, there are 103 mirrors in the palace, which also have 4 panes each, resulting in a total of 419 panes of glass for the mirrors. Therefore, the total number of panes of glass in the palace is 368 + 419 = 567."
