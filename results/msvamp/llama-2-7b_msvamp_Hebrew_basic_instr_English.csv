"Response: 36 (or 3 times 12)
Explanation:
In one day, Golliath is acting as a teacher for 18 children. In another day, she is teaching 10 children. Since each child requires approximately half an hour of her attention per day, Golliath spends approximately 9 hours with them in total over both days (half an hour x 18 children + half an hour x 10 children = 9 hours). Therefore, if we assume that there are 24 hours in a day, Golliath spends 36 hours (or 3 times 12 hours) with the children over two days."
Response: 3 more children.
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath will be acting with 8 children in the morning and 8 more in the afternoon. If she is acting with 15 children in total, then she will be acting with 30 children across both sessions (8 + 8 = 30)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath is acting as a teacher for 14 children on Wednesday and 16 children on Thursday. Therefore, if she is teaching 16 children, how many children is she teaching on Wednesday? The answer is 14."
"Response: 30 (or more)
Explanation: According to the question, Golliath is taking care of 16 children in one day, which means she has 4 times as many children as she would have if she were taking care of 12 children per day. Therefore, if she takes care of 12 children per day for two days, she will have taken care of 48 children (12 x 2 = 24), and if she takes care of 16 children per day for three days, she will have taken care of 576 children (16 x 3 = 48)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath is scheduled to babysit 14 children on Wednesday and 8 children on Thursday. If she is babysitting more children on Thursday than she was on Wednesday, then she must be babysitting 7 additional children on Thursday compared to Wednesday."

"Response: 120
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath has 9 children on day two, 7 children on day three, and 96 children on day four. Therefore, if she had more children on day two than on day three, her total number of children on day two would be greater than 7."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath has 14 children and spends time with them every day. On the second day (Sheni), she spends time with 2 more children, making it a total of 16 children. On the third day (Shlishi), she spends time with an additional 3 children, bringing the total number of children she is caring for to 19. Therefore, on the fourth day (Rabii), Golliath will be caring for 7 more children than she was on the second day (Sheni)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath has 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. Therefore, she is taking care of more children on Monday than on Wednesday (by 4 children)."
Response: 20 children (15 + 18 + 7 = 20)
Response: 24 children (13 + 10 + 15 = 28)
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath is taking care of 7 children on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, which means she has 7 + 13 = 20 children under her care overall. Therefore, the number of children surrounding Golliath while she is working as a babysitter is 20."
"Response: 70
Explanation:
To calculate the number of children Golliath is acting with in each day, we need to divide the total number of hours she spends playing games (34 hours) by the number of days she has available for playtime (2 days). This gives us an average of 17 hours per day that Golliath spends playing games. Since there are 12 children in her first group and 14 children in her second group, the ratio of children she acts with in each group is 12:14 or 3:4. Therefore, the number of children Golliath acts with in each day is 70 (3 x 23 = 69)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath will be acting with 19 children in the morning and 18 children in the afternoon. Therefore, she will have acted with a total of 40 children throughout the day (19 + 18 = 40)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath will be acting with six children in the morning and eight children in the afternoon. Therefore, if she is acting with more than six children in the afternoon (i.e., eight children), then she must have been acting with fewer than six children in the morning (i.e., six children)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath is taking care of 18 children in total across two days (Shabbat and Sunday). On Shabbat, she takes care of 4 children, and on Sunday, she takes care of an additional 3 children, for a total of 7 children that she takes care of on Sunday."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Golliath will have 4 children on Wednesday, 6 children on Thursday, and 17 children on Friday. Therefore, if she has more children on Thursday than on Wednesday, the difference between these numbers is 2 (6 - 4 = 2). So, the number of additional children Golliath will have on Thursday compared to Wednesday is 2."

"Response: 51
Explanation:
Bob ate 33 pieces of candy and then he ate another 4. He also ate 14 chocolates. In total, Bob ate 51 candies and chocolates."
"Response: 42 more chocolates than he ate.
Explanation:
Bob ate 38 chocolates from the box and then he ate another 36 chocolates. So in total, Bob ate 74 chocolates (38 + 36). However, the question asks how many more chocolates did Bob eat than what was left in the box after he finished eating all the chocolates that were shaped like eggs. Since there were 16 egg-shaped chocolates left in the box after Bob finished eating them all, the difference between the number of chocolates Bob ate and the number of chocolates left in the box is 42 (74 - 32). Therefore, Bob ate 42 more chocolates than what was left in the box after he finished eating all the chocolates that were shaped like eggs."

"Response: 41
Explanation:
Alon brought 3 bags and 20 coins to the park. Gideon brought 5 bags and 59 coins to the park. To find out how many bags Alon had at the park, we need to subtract the number of bags that Gideon brought from the total number of bags that Alon brought. Therefore, Alon had 41 bags at the park (3 - 5 = 41)."
Response: 12 (the number of balls that Elon brought) + 8 (the number of balls that Gadi brought) = 20 balls in total.
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Elon brought 5 balls to the park. If Elon and G'ik brought 6 balls to the park together, then G'ik brought 1 ball more than Elon. Therefore, G'ik brought 3 balls to the park."

Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 4 acorns on the tree. The squirrel picked up 2 of them and left 2 on the tree. Therefore, the number of acorns that the squirrel collected is 3 (2 acorns)."
"Response: 8
Explanation:
If 3 of the branches are still attached to the tree and there are 5 remaining branches that are not yet detached, then there will be 8 branches in total (3 + 5 = 8)."
"Response: 10
Explanation:
According to the question, there were initially 2 branches on the tree. If 6 of them are still attached and 3 have fallen off, then there must have been 10 branches in total (including both the initial 2 and the additional 6). Therefore, the number of branches that needed to be removed for the tree to start leaning is 4 (10 - 6 = 4)."
"Response: 8
Explanation: To determine how many branches were needed to be added initially, we need to find out how many branches are required for each of the two scenarios separately and then add them up. In scenario 1 (all branches are in good condition), 2 branches are required, so we need 2 + 0 = 2 initial branches. In scenario 2 (some branches are not in good condition), 4 branches are required, so we need 2 + 4 = 6 initial branches. Therefore, there would have been 8 branches needed at first."
"Response: 10
Explanation:
The tree had three branches that were attached to it at the beginning. After two of them broke off, there were 23 branches left on the tree. To determine how many branches were originally attached to the tree, we need to subtract the number of broken branches (2) from the total number of branches (23). Therefore, there were 10 branches originally attached to the tree."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
At first, there were 7 apples on the tree. After that, 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now, there are 6 apples left on the tree. To determine how many apples were needed to be on the tree initially, we can use the information that after 2 new apples grew, there were 6 apples left on the tree. Therefore, in total, 9 apples were needed to be on the tree initially (7 + 2)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were originally 4 branches on the tree. After that, 3 new branches grew on the tree. Therefore, there are currently 7 branches on the tree - the original 4 plus the 3 new ones."
"Response: 39
Explanation:
The tree has 52 branches and is determined to have two branches from each node. Therefore, there will be 7 branches remaining after pruning (since you mentioned that 7 branches are still attached to the trunk). To find out how many branches were needed initially, we can divide the total number of branches by the number of branches left after pruning: 52 / 7 = 39."
"Response: 120
Explanation:
The tree has 3 trunks, and each trunk has 8 branches. Now there are 9 branches on each of the remaining 2 trunks. To find out how many branches were initially on each trunk, we multiply the number of trunks by the number of branches on each trunk. Therefore, there were 3 x 8 = 24 branches on each of the initial 3 trunks, for a total of 24 x 3 = 72 branches in the beginning."

"Response: 4 inchs (or 10 cm)
Explanation:
The snake's length is given as 36 inches, and its body is longer than its tail by 15 inches. To find the distance between the head and the tail, we need to subtract the length of the tail from the total length of the snake. Therefore, the distance between the head and the tail is 4 inches (or 10 cm)."
"Response: 30 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the snake's length is 25 inches and its tail is 18 inches longer than its body. Therefore, the total length of the snake including the tail is 25 + (18 - 2) = 30 inches."
"Response: 30 inches
Explanation:
The snake's length is given as 19 inches, and the distance between the snake and the observer is 10 inches more than the snake's length. Therefore, the distance between the observer and the snake is 19 + 10 = 29 inches. The eagle's length is given as 20 inches more than the snake's length, so the distance between the observer and the eagle is 29 + 20 = 49 inches."

Therefore, the distance between the curve and the straight line is 48 inches (19 + 12 = 31)."
Response: 4 inches (or 10 cm)
"Response: 22 inches
Explanation:
The distance between two points can be calculated using the formula: Distance = √(Sum of squares of differences).
In this case, we have:
Distance = √((39 - 17)² + (17 - 0)²)
= √(62 + 17²)
= √85
= 22 inches
Therefore, the distance between the two points is 22 inches."
Response: 16 inches (48 cm)
"Response: 20 inches
Explanation:
The snake's length is given as 14 inches, and the distance between two points on its body is given as 37 inches. To find out how much farther away the second point is from the first point than the snake's length, we need to subtract the snake's length from the distance between the two points. This gives us a difference of 20 inches (37 - 14 = 20). Therefore, the answer is 20 inches."

"Response: 29
Explanation: The total number of books was 137, and after selling 137 at a discount of 50%, he had 105 left. Therefore, there were initially 29 books."
"Response: 42
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, after selling 108 books at a discount of 30%, he would have sold 35 books and left with 62 books remaining. Therefore, he sold 42 books at the discounted price."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the question, after buying 50 books at a discount of 20%, he was left with 151 books. To find out how many books he bought initially, we can use the formula: Number of books bought = Total number of books / (Discount percentage x Original price). In this case, the original price of each book is $100, and the discount percentage is 20%. So, if he bought 50 books, the total cost of the books would be $50 x 80% = $40, leaving him with $110 for the remaining 101 books. Therefore, he bought 36 books initially."
"Response: 72
Explanation:
If he bought 150 new books after selling some of his old ones at a price of $3 per book, and he had 58 books left, then he sold 92 books (150 - 58 = 92). Therefore, if he has 72 books now, that means he bought 40 more books ($72 / $3 = 40)"
"Response: 73
Explanation:
The original number of books was 21. After buying 42 new books at a discount of $X per book, he now has 15 more books than before. Therefore, if he sold each book for $Y, where Y > X, then his total revenue would be:
Total revenue = Number of books x Price per book
= 15 + 42 x ($X / 42)
= 15 + (42 x $X) / 42
= 15 + $X
So, if he sold each book for $Y, his total revenue would be $Y × 15 = $73."
"Response: 42
Explanation:
The original number of books was 71. After buying some at a discount price of $50 each, he bought 38 new ones. If he now has 116 books in total, how many more books did he buy than what he originally had? The difference between the original number and the current number is 42 books."

"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, after selling some books and pages at a discount, Pol left with 13 books and -23 pages.

"Response: 48
Explanation:
Dani found 36 balls in the park and threw away 35 of them. Now he has 22 balls left.

"Response: 276
Explanation:
The original number of cards in Nili's deck was 528. After she gave some cards to Guf, there were 11 fewer cards left in her deck, which means that Guf received 517 cards (528 - 11 = 517). Therefore, Nili gave Guf 252 cards (517 - 252 = 276)."
"Response: 289
Explanation:
The original number of cards in the deck was 566. After she gave some cards to her husband, there were 234 cards left in her hand. Now, after she gave him another set of cards, there are 535 cards left in her hand. Therefore, the number of cards left in her husband's hand is 289 (535 - 234)."
"Response: 287
Explanation:
To find out how many more BYISVOL cards there are than 10 cards, we need to subtract the number of remaining 10 cards from the total number of cards given to her. The total number of cards she received is 309 BYISVOL and 356 10 cards, for a total of 345 cards. Since she gave away 415 BYISVOL cards and 149 10 cards, there are 287 more BYISVOL cards than 10 cards left with her."
"Response: 378
Explanation:
The total number of cards in both decks is 246 + 214 = 460. Since she gave some cards to her friend and now has 404 Bee suit cards and 495 Ten suit cards remaining, the difference between the two suits is 495 - 404 = 91. Therefore, there are 91 more Bee suit cards than Ten suit cards. To find out how many more than 10 cards, we divide 91 by 10 = 9. So, there are 9 more than 10 cards in the Bee suit deck."

Explanation:
Ron stood at 4 meters away from the waterfall, which is 16 times higher than its width. The depth of the water is 9 meters deeper than the height of the waterfall. If Ron was standing 4 meters away from the waterfall, the depth of the water would be 20 centimeters (8 inches)."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, after they decided to go for a swim, the depth of the water was 9 feet. If Ron is 15 meters tall and Danny is 6 meters tall, how much deeper will the water be if Ron dives in? To find this out, we need to subtract Danny's height from the total depth of the water, which gives us 20 meters (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, the water will be 20 meters deeper if Ron dives in."

"Response: 35
Explanation:
If she bought 109 bottles of water at a price of $X per bottle and sold them for $Y per bottle, her profit would be:
Profit = Number of bottles x Price per bottle - Cost per bottle
= 109 x $X - Cost per bottle
We are given that she made a profit of $74 in one day. So, if she sold each bottle for $Y per bottle, we can set up the equation:
$74 = (Number of bottles) x ($Y - $X)
Now, we know that she sold 109 bottles, so we can plug this value into the equation:
$74 = (109) x ($Y - $X)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$74 = 109($Y - $X)
Subtracting $X from both sides gives us:
$65 = $Y - $X
Dividing both sides by $Y gives us:
$65 / $Y = $X - $X
Simplifying further, we get:
$65 / $Y = $X
So, if she sold each bottle for $Y per bottle, then she made a profit of $65 per bottle. Since she had 109 bottles, she made a total profit of $65 x 109 = $7400."

Explanation:
If Debi bought 153 bottles of water at a discount of $0.20 per bottle and she drank one bottle every day, then she would have drunk 153/1 = 153 days' worth of water. Since it took her 17 days to drink all the water, she would have drunk 153 / 17 = 9 days' worth of water each day."
"Response: 308
Explanation:
If she bought 264 bottles of water at a discount of 50%, then she paid $132 for them (264 x $0.5 = $132). If she drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, then she had 308 bottles left (15 x 11 = 165, plus the original 264)."
Response: 28 days.
"Response: 20 days
Explanation:
If she bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of secret sauce at a discounted price, then she paid $X for the water and $Y for the secret sauce. Let's assume that the cost per liter of water is $Z and the cost per liter of secret sauce is $W. Then, we can calculate the total cost of the water as follows:
Total cost of water = Number of liters x Cost per liter = 88 x Z = X
Similarly, the total cost of the secret sauce is: Total cost of secret sauce = Number of liters x Cost per liter = 13 x W = Y
Now, if she drinks 4 liters of water and 87 liters of secret sauce in one day, then the number of days it will take to finish the remaining water is: Number of days = Total amount of water / Amount drunk per day = X / (4 + 87) = 20
Therefore, it will take her 20 days to finish the remaining water."

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, Deborah bought 360 bags of sugar and 162 bags of flour at a discounted price. If she had 122 bags of flour and 9 bags of sugar on hand at the beginning of the day, how many days would it take for her to run out of both if she uses them equally?
To calculate this, we need to divide the total amount of each ingredient that Deborah has by the number of days she wants to last without running out (in this case, 48 days).
So, if Deborah uses each bag of sugar and flour equally, she will run out of both after 48 days."

"Response: 40
Explanation:
There are 87 classes in the school and 58 students per class, so there are a total of 496 students in the school (87 x 58). Since each bus can hold at most 20 students, we need 40 buses to transport all the students on the trip."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
Since there are 24 classes in total and each class has an equal number of students (as stated in the question), we can assume that each class has 24/24 = 1 student per carpool.

"Response: 3
Explanation: Since there are 102 students in total and 8 buses available for transportation, each bus can accommodate at most 13 students (102 / 8 = 13). If 22 students do not want to go on the trip, then 3 buses are required to take them (22 / 13 = 3)."
Response: 46 students went on the trip.
"Response: 4
Explanation:
Since there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students, the total number of students is 72 x 3 = 216 students. Since there are already 3 autobuses available for transporting students, we need an additional 111 - 3 = 108 autobuses to accommodate all the students. Therefore, 4 autobuses are needed to transport all the students."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
Since there are 17 classes in the school and each class has 4-5 students, the total number of students in the school is 17 x 4 = 68 students. Since there are 46 buses available for transporting students, the number of stops per bus can be calculated as follows: Number of stops per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 68 students / 46 buses = 1.47 stops per bus. Therefore, if all buses fill up with passengers, there will be approximately 1.47 stops per bus."

If you have 14 eggs with a price of $5 each and 28 eggs with a price of $4 each, then the total cost of all the eggs is:
$5 x 14 = $70
$4 x 28 = $112
So, the total cost of all the eggs is $70 + $112 = $182.
Since there are 86 items in total, the cost per egg is:
$182 / 86 = $2.15
Therefore, you have 30 eggs."
"Response: 100 houses.
Explanation: If the messenger needs to give 5 phone numbers for each block and there are 25 phone numbers in total, then there will be 100 blocks (since there are 25 phone numbers / 5 phone numbers per block = 100 blocks)."

Response: 35 homes will receive two phone lines each.
Response: 64 (he needs to give 64 phone numbers)
"Response: 24
Explanation:
To determine how many phone calls Sheli needs to make to each of the 78 blocks, we need to divide the total number of phone calls by the number of blocks. Since there are 19 houses in each block, Sheli needs to make 24 phone calls (19 x 78 = 1462)."
"Response: 17
Explanation:
If he gives 32 phone numbers to each of the 55 houses in the block, there will be 32 x 55 = 1700 phone numbers in total. Therefore, there are 17 blocks with 1700 / 15 = 113 homes per block."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
If there are 12 houses in each block and 81 blocks in total, then there will be 12 x 81 = 972 houses in total. Since each house needs 4 phone lines, the total number of phone lines required is 972 x 4 = 3680 phone lines. Therefore, the person needs to provide 3680 phone lines to all the houses in the city."
"Response: 20
Explanation:
If there are 16 houses in each block and 4 telephone lines are needed for each house, then the total number of telephone lines required is 16 x 4 = 64. Since there are 17 blocks, the total number of telephone lines needed is 64 / 17 = 20."

"Response: 20
Explanation: Since Rabka has 4 cups and each cup contains 15 beans, there will be a total of 60 beans (4 x 15 = 60). Therefore, each group will receive 3 beans (60 / 20 = 3)."
"Response: 30 groups of beads can be formed with Rabka's remaining beads.
Explanation: To determine how many groups of beads can be formed, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of beads in each group. In this case, there are 18 beads left over after Rabka has taken 6 beads from the bag, so we can form 18 / 6 = 3 groups of beads. Since there are 72 pebbles and -66 gullies, we cannot form any more groups using these additional items. Therefore, the final answer is 30 groups of beads can be formed with Rabka's remaining beads."
"Response: 40 groups of beads can be formed with Rabka's remaining beads.
Explanation: To determine how many groups of beads can be formed, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of beads in each group. In this case, there are 99 beads left, and each group requires 3 beads. Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can be formed is:
40 = 99 / 3
So, Rabka can form 40 groups of beads using her remaining beads."
"Response: 34
Explanation:
Ravka has 20 beads and -6 dots. To find out how many more beads Ravka needs to have an odd number of beads, we subtract 6 from 20, which gives us 14. Since Ravka wants to have an odd number of beads, she needs 34 more beads."

"Response: 180 (shares)
Explanation:
To calculate the number of shares Ami can buy for each of her 72 friends, we need to divide the total number of shares by the number of friends she wants to buy for. In this case, there are 6 different types of shares, and Ami wants to buy 3 shares for each of her 72 friends, so the total number of shares she needs to buy is:
6 x 72 = 432
divided by 72 = 6
So Ami can buy 6 x 3 = 18 shares for each of her friends."
"Response: 16 (or 17) charros are needed for each sharsheret.
Explanation:
The total number of charros required is calculated as follows:

"Response: 74 kg (or 163 lbs)
Explanation:
Grace lost 56 kg (or 123 lbs) in the first week and 99 kg (or 218 lbs) in the second week. Therefore, her weight after the second week is:
Weight after second week = Weight before second week - Weight lost in second week
= 92 kg - 99 kg
= -7 kg
Since she did not lose any weight during the first week, her weight at the end of the two weeks is:
Weight after both weeks = Weight before first week + Weight lost in first week + Weight lost in second week
= 92 kg + (-56 kg) + (-7 kg)
= 74 kg
Therefore, Grace's weight after the two weeks is 74 kg or 163 lbs."

Explanation:
Let's assume that each ""סקיטל"" represents 154 people (as per the question). Therefore, the total number of people in all 4502 ""סקיטלים"" is:
4502 x 154 = 676,308
Similarly, the total number of people in all 4276 ""מחסכות"" is:
4276 x 154 = 645,344
Now, let's find out how many groups of 154 people there are in both sets combined:
Total number of people in both sets = 676,308 + 645,344 = 1321,652
Number of groups of 154 people = Total number of people / 154 = 1321,652 / 154 = 850
Therefore, the size of each group is approximately 850 people."
"Response: 276
Explanation:
To find out how many larger groups there are in total, we need to divide the number of soccer teams (4,950) by the number of smaller groups (3,941). This gives us an average size of each group as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of soccer teams / Number of smaller groups
= 4,950 / 3,941
= 1.28

So, approximately 1.28 times more than the number of smaller groups have larger groups. To find the exact number of larger groups, we can round up this value to the nearest whole number:

Number of larger groups = Round up (1.28 x 3,941)
= Round up (4,676)
= 276

Therefore, there are 276 larger groups in total."
