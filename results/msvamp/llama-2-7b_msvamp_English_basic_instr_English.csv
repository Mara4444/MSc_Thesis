Explanation: According to the question, there are 5 more birds that joined the two original birds already sitting on the fence, making a total of 7 birds. However, there are only 4 more storks that joined them, so the number of birds exceeds the number of storks by 3 (7 - 4 = 3)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The number of birds initially sitting on the fence is 3.
Then, 2 more birds come to join them, making it 5 birds in total (including the initial 3).
After that, 6 more storks arrive, bringing the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence to 11 (5 birds + 6 storks).
So, there are 4 more storks than birds sitting on the fence (6 storks - 3 birds = 4)."
"Response: 7 (birds) - 5 (storks) = 2
Therefore, there are 2 more birds than storks sitting on the fence."
Response: 4 storks - 2 birds = 2 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.
"Response: 4
Explanation: The total number of birds initially was 3 + 2 = 5. Then, 6 more storks joined them, making it 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, there are 4 more storks than birds sitting on the fence (8 - 5)."
"Response: 37 pages
Explanation: To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the first chapter.
Total number of pages in the first chapter = 48 + 48 = 96 pages
Number of pages in the second chapter = 11 pages
Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the first and second chapters = 96 - 11 = 37 pages."
"Response: 43 pages
Explanation: To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we need to subtract the length of the first chapter from the length of the second chapter. The second chapter is 80 pages long, and the first chapter is 37 pages long, so we can calculate the difference as follows:

Second chapter length - First chapter length = 80 - 37 = 43 pages
Therefore, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter."

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Chapter 1 - 35 pages
Chapter 2 - 18 pages
Chapter 3 - 3 pages
To find out how many more pages Chapter 2 has than Chapter 3, we need to subtract the length of Chapter 3 from the length of Chapter 2:
18 pages (Chapter 2) - 3 pages (Chapter 3) = 15 pages
Therefore, Chapter 2 has 15 more pages than Chapter 3."
"Response: 40 pages
Explanation:
Let's analyze each chapter's length in pages:
Chapter 1 - 53 pages
Chapter 2 - 75 pages
Chapter 3 - 21 pages

Explanation: If Rachel picked 4 apples from her tree and the tree originally had 7 apples, then after picking the 4 apples, there would be 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel's tree had 4 apples initially. If she picked some apples and now there are 2 apples left on the tree, then Rachel must have picked 2 apples."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from the tree, leaving 5 apples still on the tree. Of these remaining apples, 3 are ripe and 2 are unripe. Therefore, the number of unripe apples on the tree is 2."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel had 3 ripe apples on her tree before she picked any. Now, there are 7 apples left on the tree, including 6 that are ripe. Therefore, the tree had 3 + 6 = 9 apples, including both ripe and unripe ones, before Rachel picked any."
"Response: 8 apples
Explanation: Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree, which means that there were originally 6 + 2 = 8 apples on the tree."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from her tree, leaving the tree with 2 ripe apples (the original number of ripe apples). Then, the tree gained 27 unripe apples. To find out how many ripe apples the tree had initially, we need to subtract the number of apples that were picked (3) from the total number of apples on the tree (2 + 27 = 39). Therefore, the tree had 5 ripe apples at the beginning."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Rachel initially had 7 apples on her tree. After she picked some of them, there were 2 new apples that grew on the tree, bringing the total number of apples to 6. Therefore, the tree had 9 apples in total (7 + 2 = 9)."
"Response: 5 apples
Explanation: Rachel's tree initially had 2 apples, and then she picked 4 of them. After that, 3 new apples grew on the tree, so there are now 5 apples on the tree in total - 2 + 4 + 3 = 5."
"Response: 50 apples
Explanation: Rachel had 52 apple trees and picked 2 apples from one of them, leaving 7 apples remaining on that tree. Since there is only one tree involved in this problem, we can conclude that all 52 trees originally had 50 apples each (52 - 2 = 50)."

Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug initially. So, Ed had 2 + 5 = 7 more marbles than Doug. Now, it is stated that Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, the number of marbles Doug lost is equal to the difference between the total number of marbles he originally had and the number of marbles he has left after losing them at the playground. In this case, Doug had 5 marbles initially, so he lost 5 - 0 = 5 marbles."
Response: 26 (marbles)
Response: 14 (marbles)
"Response: 20
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, which means Ed had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles initially.
Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground, so he had 20 (initial number of marbles) - 3 = 17 marbles initially.
Therefore, the answer is 20."
"Response: 31
Explanation:
Ed initially had 24 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed's total number of marbles = 24 + Doug's total number of marbles.
Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground, so Doug's new total number of marbles = Doug's original total number of marbles - 27.
Now, Ed found 9 more marbles, so Ed's new total number of marbles = Ed's original total number of marbles + 9.
Therefore, Ed has 31 more marbles than Doug now."
Response: 46
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had x - 19 marbles, then Ed lost 7 marbles. Therefore, Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing 7 marbles."

"Response: 305
Explanation: Let's first calculate the total number of students in the school after the addition of new girls:
Total number of girls = 135 + 496 = 631
Total number of boys = 214 + 910 = 1124
Now, let's find out the number of boys in the school after adding the new boys:
Number of boys in the school = Total number of boys - Number of boys who were already in the school
= 1124 - 214
= 910
Therefore, there are 910 boys in the school now."
Response: 624 (308 x 2 + 318)
Response: 694 (315 + 309)
Response: 337 boys
"Response: 1030 (step-by-step calculation)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that there are 458 more girls than boys in the school. This means that for every boy in the school, there are 458 + 1 = 459 girls.

So, if there are x boys in the school, then there are 459x girls in the school.

Step 2: The question states that there are 692 girls in the school. So, we can set up an equation using this information:

459x = 692

Step 3: To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 459:

x = 692 / 459

x = 1030

Therefore, there are 1030 pupils in the school, including 458 boys and 572 girls."

Response: 54 inches
Response: 30 inches
"Response: 3 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper (which is 29 inches), and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog (which is 49 inches). Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the grasshopper is 49 - 3 = 46 inches."
Response: 57 inches
Response: 19 inches
"Response: 10 inches
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information to find out how far the mouse jumped compared to the grasshopper. We know that the grasshopper jumped 24 inches, and the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, the distance the frog jumped is equal to 33 - 24 = 9 inches more than the grasshopper's jump. Now, we need to subtract the distance the mouse jumped from the frog's jump to find out how far the mouse jumped compared to the grasshopper. According to the problem, the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so the distance the mouse jumped is equal to the frog's jump minus the mouse's jump. Therefore, the mouse jumped 9 - 5 = 4 inches farther than the grasshopper."
Response: 15 inches
"Response: 40 inches
Explanation: The grasshopper jumped 35 inches, which is 4 inches more than its own distance. So, if we add both distances together, the total distance that the grasshopper and the frog jumped in the competition would be 35 + 4 = 40 inches."

Response: 28 inches
"Response: 7 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance that the grasshopper jumped is 21 inches, and the distance that the mouse jumped is 16 inches less than the frog's jump. Therefore, the distance that the grasshopper jumped compared to the mouse is:
Grasshopper - Mouse = 21 - 16 = 7 inches
So, the grasshopper jumped 7 inches farther than the mouse."
Response: 22 inches (39 - 17 = 22)
Response: 27 inches
"Response: 2 inches
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the mouse jumped 16 inches fewer than the grasshopper. Since the grasshopper jumped 14 inches, the mouse jumped 16 - 14 = 2 inches fewer than the grasshopper."

"Response: 183
Explanation: According to the question, Paul initially received a box of 253 crayons and lost/gave away 70 of them during the school year. Therefore, he had 253 - 70 = 183 crayons left by the end of the school year."
Response: 374
"Response: 23

Explanation:
Paul had 440 crayons initially. He gave away 111 crayons to his friends, leaving him with 329 crayons (440 - 111 = 329). Then, he lost 106 crayons, which means he has 23 crayons left (329 - 106 = 23)."
"Response: 16

Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 213 crayons during the school year and lost 16 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons that were either lost or given away is 213 + 16 = 229 crayons."
"Response: 140
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paul received a total of 589 crayons as a gift.
* During the school year, he gave away 571 crayons (which is equal to 589 - 161).
* He lost 161 crayons.

Now, let's find out how many more crayons Paul gave to his friends than those he lost:

Number of crayons given to friends = Number of crayons received - Number of crayons lost
= 589 - 161
= 428

Therefore, Paul gave 428 more crayons to his friends than those he lost."
"Response: 536 - 90 = 446

Explanation:
Paul gave away 90 crayons to his friends, so he had 110 - 90 = 20 crayons left. Then, he lost 412 crayons, which is equal to 412 - 20 = 392 crayons. Therefore, Paul lost 392 more crayons than he gave to his friends."
Response: 79 crayons (332 - 558 = 79)
"Response: 535 - 52 = 483

Explanation: Paul initially had 535 crayons and gave 52 to his friends during the school year. This means that he lost 535 - 52 = 483 crayons."

Response: 140 (more crayons than erasers)
Response: 70 (erase - crayon)
"Response: 346
Explanation: According to the problem, Paul received 346 crayons in total. By the end of the school year, he had 291 left after losing or giving away 315. Therefore, he initially received 346 - 315 = 31 crayons."
Response: 95 (more)
"Response: 98 (crayons) - 523 = -425
Explanation: Paul started with 457 erasers and 320 crayons, so he had a total of 777 items (457 + 320). At the end of the school year, he was left with 523 erasers and crayons, which means he lost 254 erasers and crayons (-523). Therefore, he has 98 more crayons than erasers left (-425)."
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The waiter initially served 11 customers.
After some left, he still had 3 customers.
So, the number of customers who left = total initial customers - remaining customers.
= 11 - 3
= 8
Therefore, 8 more customers left than remained behind."
"Response: 2
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The waiter initially had 3 customers.
After some left, he still had 4 customers.
So, the number of customers who left = 4 - 3 = 1.
Therefore, the number of more customers who stayed behind than those who left is 2 (since there are 2 more customers remaining)."
Response: 30 customers (the sum of 9 and 12)
Response: 9 customers
Response: 5 customers left.
"Response: 9
Explanation: The waiter initially had 12 customers and lost 15 customers. This means that he gained 14 new customers. However, since some of these new customers may have also left, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers the waiter has now. Therefore, the waiter currently has 9 customers."
Response: 5 new customers arrived.
"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Initially, the waiter had 8 customers.
2. Some customers left, leaving him with 5 customers.
3. Then, he got 99 new customers.

So, if the initial number of customers was 8 and some customers left, leaving him with 5 customers, that means there were initially 8 + 5 = 13 customers in total.
Now, when he got 99 new customers, the total number of customers would be 13 (initial) + 99 = 112 customers.
Therefore, 40 customers left (112 - 8)."
Response: 24 (Customers)
Response: 5 dollars
"Response: 1$
Explanation: According to the question, Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 on something else (presumably the candy bar). Therefore, the candy bar must have cost $3."
"Response:  $1
Explanation: Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 x 99 = $297 on buying candy bars. Therefore, he has $4 - $297 =-$293 left."
Response:  Each candy bar costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
"Response:  Dan bought 4 candy bars.
Explanation: According to the question, Dan had $2 and spent $6 per candy bar. Therefore, if he bought x candy bars, then his total spending would be $2 + (x \* $6) = $2 + $12 = $14. Since Dan only had $2 initially, it is not possible for him to have spent more than that amount, so we can conclude that he bought 4 candy bars."
"Response:  $5
Explanation: Dan had $7 to start with. When he bought a candy bar for $2, he spent $2, leaving him with $5 ($7 - $2). Then when he bought a chocolate for $3, he spent another $3, leaving him with $2 ($5 - $3)."
Response: 13 dollars ( $ 7 + $ 6 )
"Response: 4 dollars
Explanation: To find out how much Dan spent buying the candy bar compared to the chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the total amount of money Dan had ($2). The cost of the candy bar is $6, so if Dan spent all his money on these two items, then he spent $6 on the candy bar and $3 on the chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the amounts he spent on each item is $6 - $3 = $4."
"Response:  $ 3 - $ 2 = $ 1  
Therefore, Dan spent $ 1 more to buy the chocolate than he did to buy the candy bar."
"Response:  $16 - ($8 + $5) = $16 - $13 = $3 
Therefore, Dan has $3 left after buying a candy bar and receiving $5 from his friend."
Response: 75 cents (or $0.75)
"Response:  $2.60
Explanation: Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 to buy 10 candy bars, which costs the same amount of money. Therefore, the remaining amount of money that Dan has after buying the candy bars is $2.60 ($4 - $3)."
Response:  $1.50 per candy bar 
"Response:  $ 4 
Explanation : To find out how much Dan spent buying the candy bar than he did buying the chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the total amount of money that Dan spent. According to the question, Dan spent $ 3 on the chocolate and $ 7 on the candy bar, so the difference between these two amounts is $ 7 - $ 3 = $ 4. Therefore, Dan spent $ 4 more to buy the candy bar than he did to buy the chocolate."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Dan spent $7 on the chocolate and $2 on the candy bar, so he spent $7 + $2 = $9 on both items combined. Therefore, he spent more money buying the chocolate ($7) than he did buying the candy bar ($2)."
"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the question, Paul has 115 books initially. He sells 78 books at a garage sale, which means he is left with 115 - 78 = 37 books."
Response: 282 books (105 - 137 = 282)
Response: 46 books (books sold at garage sale)
Response: 96 (books)
Response: 72 (books sold)
"Response: 30 (books sold - books bought) = 30

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Paul initially had 21 books.
* He sold some of his books at a garage sale and made $X amount of money.
* After selling his books, he used that money to buy 42 new books.
* Now, he has 15 books left.

To find out how many more books Paul sold than he bought, we need to subtract the number of books he bought from the number of books he sold:

Number of books sold = 21 (initial number of books) - 42 (number of new books bought) = -21

So, Paul sold 21 more books than he bought. Therefore, the answer is 30 (books sold - books bought)."
"Response: 38 - 71 = -33
Paul bought more books than he sold. He bought 38 new books and sold 71 books, so he gained 33 books."
Response: 42 books were sold at the garage sale.

"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 21 bottle caps before going to the park. If he found some more bottle caps at the park and now has 53 bottle caps in total, then the number of bottle caps he found at the park is equal to the difference between his current total and his initial total, which is:
53 - 21 = 32
Therefore, Danny found 32 bottle caps at the park."
Response: 51
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 35 old bottle caps that he threw away and then found 36 new bottle caps at the park. So, the difference between the number of bottle caps he found and the number he threw away is 36 - 35 = 1. Therefore, Danny found 1 additional bottle cap at the park compared to the ones he already had."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Danny had 63 old bottle caps that he threw away, and he found 30 new bottle caps at the park. Therefore, the total number of bottle caps Danny threw away is 63 + 30 = 93. Since Danny currently has 42 bottle caps in his collection, the difference between the number of bottle caps he threw away and the number he found at the park is 93 - 42 = 51. So, Danny threw away 51 more bottle caps than he found at the park."
Response: 10 (bottle caps)
Response: 30 wrappers
"Response: 52
Explanation: According to the information provided, Danny had 30 bottle caps before going to the park. He then found 30 more bottle caps at the park, which means he gained 30 - 30 = 0 bottle caps. Additionally, he found 14 wrappers at the park, so he gained 14 + 14 = 28 wrappers. Therefore, Danny found 52 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park (28 wrappers / 30 bottle caps)."
"Response: 39

Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 68 bottle caps before finding any additional ones at the park. He also found 28 wrappers at the park, which means he now has 51 wrappers in total (including the initial 28). To determine how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny found at the park, subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 51 - 68 = -17. Therefore, Danny found 39 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers initially. After finding additional bottle caps and wrappers, Danny's new total for bottle caps is 28, and his new total for wrappers is 16. To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps: 28 (bottle caps) - 16 (wrappers) = 12 (more bottle caps than wrappers)."
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 62 wrappers before finding additional ones at the park. After adding those new wrappers to his collection, he now has 43 wrappers. To find out how many more wrappers Danny has than bottle caps, subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 43 - 27 = 15. Therefore, Danny has 15 more wrappers than bottle caps."
"Response: 41
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Danny had 66 bottle caps initially and lost 66 - 25 = 41 of them at the park. Therefore, Danny had 41 bottle caps at first."
Response: 7 (Danny found 7 additional bottle caps at the park)
"Response: 60
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny collected 60 bottle caps before throwing away 60 of them at the park. This means that he had 60 bottle caps initially. The additional 58 new bottle caps he found do not affect the number of bottle caps he already had."
"Response: 48
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 6 old bottle caps before throwing away 6 of them at the park. This means that he had 6 - 6 = 0 old bottle caps left after throwing them away. Then, he found 50 new bottle caps at the park, which brings the total number of bottle caps in his collection to 60 (including both old and new). Therefore, the difference between the number of bottle caps Danny found at the park and the number he threw away is 50 - 6 = 48."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 52 bottle caps in his collection after throwing away 54 and finding 48 new ones. Therefore, the difference between the number of bottle caps thrown away (54) and the number of bottle caps found (48) is equal to 6."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 30 bottle caps before going to the park. This is because it states that he ""found 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps at the park."" If he already had 30 bottle caps before going to the park, then he must have collected 59 new bottle caps (82 - 30 = 59) and lost 11 bottle caps (29 - 30 = -11). Therefore, Danny now has 42 bottle caps in his collection."
Response: 68 wrappers
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 50 bottle caps and 46 wrappers at the park initially. After finding additional bottle caps and wrappers, Danny's collection consisted of 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers. To determine how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park, we subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 52 - 21 = 31. Therefore, Danny found 31 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park."
"Response: 44
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park initially. Afterward, he collected 31 additional bottle caps and 9 additional wrappers for a total of 9 = 44 more wrappers than bottle caps."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 12 bottle caps before adding any new ones. He then added 11 wrappers to his collection, which means he now has a total of 12 + 11 = 23 items in his collection (still mostly bottle caps). So, Danny has 30% more bottle caps than wrappers in his collection right now."
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps before adding any new items from the park. If he found 15 additional bottle caps and 18 additional wrappers at the park, then he now has 67 + 15 = 82 wrappers and 35 + 18 = 53 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny has 82 - 35 = 47 more wrappers than bottle caps."
"Response: 28
Explanation: Let J = number of peaches that Steven has and P = number of peaches that Jake has. Since Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven, we can write: P = S - 11. Also, Jake has 17 peaches, so we can write: P + 17 = 11. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: S = 28 (peaches). Therefore, Steven has 28 peaches."
Response: 29
"Response: 25
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that if Steven has x peaches, Jake will have x - 18 peches.
Steven has 19 peaches. So, Jake will have 19 - (x - 18) = 19 + 18 = 37 peaches.
Since Jill has 37 peaches, and Steven has 19 peaches, we can conclude that Jill has 37 - 19 = 18 peaches."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 3 peaches. Since Steven has 5 peaches, we can set up the equation:
Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches + 5
Substituting the value of Steven's peaches (5), we get:
Jake's peaches = 5 + 5
Jake's peaches = 10
Therefore, Jake has 10 more peaches than Jill."

"Response: 40 - 16 = 24
Jill has 24 more peaches than Jake."
Response: 31
Response: 25
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that Jake has x peaches. Since Jake also has 8 more apples than Steven, Jake has x + 8 apples.
Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples, so he has 17 - x peaches. Since Jake has x + 8 apples, we can set up the equation:
x + 8 = 17 - x
Solving for x, we get:
2x = 9
x = 9/2
Therefore, Steven has 9 more peaches than apples."
"Response: 5
Explanation: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 9 peaches (3 - 3 = 9). Steven has 12 peaches, which is 3 more than the number of peaches that Jake has. Therefore, Steven has 3 more peaches than apples."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Steven has 12 peaches.
Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches.
Jill has 67 more peaches than Jake, so Jill has 8 + 67 = 75 peaches.
Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that Jake has x - 12 = 6 peaches. Since Jill has 8 more peaches than Steven, Jill has 8 + x = 14 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 14 peaches."
"Response: 30
Explanation: Jake has 30 peaches.
To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to use the information given in the problem:
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means he has (19 - 12) = 7 peaches less than Steven.
Additionally, Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, which means he has (72 + x) = 89 more peaches than Jill for some value of x.
So, Jake's total number of peaches is 7 + 89 = 96. Therefore, Jake has 96 peaches."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 peaches less than Steven. Additionally, Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill, which means that Jill has 14 + 3 = 17 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 9 peaches."
Response:  Jake has 42 peaches.
Response: 25
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that Steven has 8 + 8 = 16 peaches more than Jake. Additionally, Steven has 10 more apples than Jake, so Steven has 18 (peaches) - 10 (apples) = 8 more peaches than apples. Therefore, Steven has 6 more peaches than apples than Jake."
"Response: 7
Explanation: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, which means that Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches. Therefore, Steven has 7 more apples than peaches."

"Response: 100 - 78 = 22
Therefore, Olivia had $22 initially."
Response: 23 dollars (159 - 148 = 11 + 23)
"Response: 52 dollars
Explanation:
Olivia had $3 in her wallet initially. She collected $49 from an ATM, so now she has $49 + $3 = $52.
However, after visiting the supermarket, there were only $49 dollars left, which means that Olivia spent $52 - $49 = $3 at the supermarket. Therefore, she collected $52 - $3 = $49 more money at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket."
"Response: 38 dollars
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Olivia had $53 in her wallet initially.
* She collected $91 more dollars from an ATM. So, now she has $144 ($53 + $91).
* After visiting a supermarket, $14 was deducted from her total amount.

Now, let's find out how much more money Olivia spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM:

Total amount collected = $91
Amount spent at supermarket = $14
Difference between total amount collected and amount spent = Total amount collected - Amount spent = $91 - $14 = $77

Therefore, Olivia spent $77 more at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM."
Response: 37 dollars
"Response:  $25

Explanation: According to the problem statement, Olivia had $54 in her wallet initially and spent $29 at the supermarket. Therefore, the amount of money she spent is $29."
"Response: 90 dollars
Explanation: To find out how much money Olivia has left after spending $38 at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount of money in her wallet. The initial amount of money in her wallet was $128, and she spent $38, so she has $128 - $38 = $90 left."

"Response: 30 - 15 = 15
Dave deleted 15 apps from his phone."
Response: 7 (files)
"Response: 7
Explanation: Dave initially had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 apps. To find out how many more apps than files he has left on the phone, we need to subtract the number of files from the number of apps. So, 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone."
"Response: 22
Explanation: Dave initially had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 apps. To find out how many more files than apps he has left on the phone, we need to subtract the number of apps from the total number of files. So, 24 (files) - 2 (apps) = 22."

"Response: 375
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Nell had 301 baseball cards at first. She then gave 301 of those cards to Jeff, leaving her with 154 cards. So, if Nell had 301 cards initially, she must have started with 375 cards in total (301 + 154 = 375)."
"Response: 476
Explanation:
Nell initially had 528 baseball cards, and Jeff had 11 cards. This means that Nell had 517 more cards than Jeff (528 - 11 = 517). Then, Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her collection by x number of cards. Since Nell still has 252 cards left after giving some to Jeff, we can set up the equation: 517 - x = 252. Solving for x, we get x = 476, so Nell gave Jeff 476 cards."

Response: 26 (more baseball cards than 10 cards)
"Response: 45
Explanation:
Nell initially had 38 10-card packs and 239 baseball cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, who received 376 10-card packs and 111 baseball cards from Nell. To find out how many more 10-card packs Nell has than baseball cards, we need to subtract the number of 10-card packs she gave to Jeff (376) from the total number of 10-card packs she originally had (38 + 376 = 414). Then, divide this difference by the original number of baseball cards (239):
414 - 376 = 38
38 / 239 = 45
Therefore, Nell has 45 more 10-card packs than baseball cards."

Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her $8 more than her father."
"Response: 2 dollars
Explanation: Gwen received $3 from her mom and then spent $4, leaving her with $7 ($3 + $6 - $4). Since her dad gave her an additional $6, Gwen received a total of $13 ($7 + $6) from both parents. Therefore, Gwen's dad gave her $13 - $7 = $6 more than her mom."
Response: 3 dollars 
"Response: 3 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, Gwen received $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom, for a total of $7. If she spent $6, that means she had $1 left over after spending (the amount she received from her mom is less than the amount she spent). So, Gwen's dad gave her $3 more than her mom did ($6 - $2 = $4, which is equal to $3 since there are 4 dollars difference between the two amounts)."

Explanation:
Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds, so his dad's strawberries must have weighed 35 - 13 = 22 pounds more than Marco's."
"Response: 3 pounds
Explanation: According to the passage, Marco's strawberries weighed 20 pounds in total with him and his dad picking them together. Since his dad's strawberries weighed 17 pounds less than Marco's, that means Marco's strawberries alone must have weighed 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3)."
Response: 40 pounds (8 + 32)
"Response: 16 pounds
Explanation: Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back, which means he had 3 pounds left (3 - 9 = -6). Since Marco's strawberries now weighed 3 pounds, his dad's strawberries must have originally weighed 16 pounds (24 - 9 = 16)."
"Response: 40 pounds
Explanation: Marco's strawberries initially weighed 36 pounds, and after he and his dad were on their way back, his dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marco's remaining strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed after losing 8 pounds, you can simply subtract 8 from the initial weight of 36 pounds, which gives you 28 pounds. So, his dad's strawberries now weigh 40 pounds (36 - 8 = 28)."

Explanation: The number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop is 4 (since 2 children were already on the bus). Therefore, the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 10 - 2 + 4 = 8 more children than there were before the bus stop."
Response: 54 (26 + 38)
Response: 3
Response: 20 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
"Response: 23
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initial number of children on the bus = 41
* Number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop = unknown (not provided in the question)
* Current number of children on the bus = 18

To find out how many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than there are now, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children on the bus:

Number of children who were on the bus before the bus stop = 41 - X
Where X is the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop.

Since we know that 18 children are currently on the bus, and we want to find out how many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than there are now, we can set up an equation:

41 - X = 18

Solving for X, we get:

X = 23

Therefore, there were 23 more children on the bus before the bus stop than there are now."

"Response: 46
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 121 cakes.
* He sold 105 of them, so he has 121 - 105 = 16 cakes left.
* He bought 170 new cakes, so now he has 16 + 170 = 186 cakes.

Therefore, the baker still has 186 cakes."

"Response: 39
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries, then we can calculate the difference between the number of cakes and pastries that the baker made as follows:
Number of cakes made by the baker - Number of cakes sold = 126 - 115 = 11
Similarly, the difference between the number of pastries made by the baker and those sold is:
Number of pastries made by the baker - Number of pastries sold = 48 - 81 = -33
Since the baker made more cakes than pastries, the difference between the two quantities is positive. Therefore, the baker made 39 more cakes than pastries."

Explanation: If Baker sold 8 cakes and initially made 40 cakes, then he made 40 - 8 = 32 more cakes than those he sold."
"Response: 32
Explanation: Let's assume that the baker has sold all the cakes he had initially (169). If he had sold 137 cakes to his friend, then he must have had some left over after selling them. So, the number of cakes the baker still has is equal to the initial quantity minus the number of cakes sold = 169 - 137 = 32."
Response: 94 cakes
Response: 40 (more)
"Response: 6 (more)
Explanation: The number of cakes the baker sold is 145, while the number of cakes he bought is 139. Therefore, the difference between these two numbers is 6, which means that the baker sold 6 more cakes than he bought."
"Response: 7
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 62 cakes initially.
* Then, he made 149 more cakes. So, the total number of cakes he made is 62 + 149 = 211 cakes.
* He sold 144 of these cakes. This means that the number of cakes he has left is 211 - 144 = 67 cakes.

Therefore, the baker would still have 67 cakes."
Response: 53 (more cakes)
"Response: 23
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The baker made 61 pastries and 167 cakes. If he sold 108 cakes, then he has (167 - 108) = 59 cakes left.
If he also sold 44 pastries, then he has (59 - 44) = 15 cakes left.
Therefore, the baker still has 15 cakes."

Response: 25 blocks were used to build the tower.
"Response: 54 blocks
Explanation: To find out how many blocks Randy has left, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for building the tower and the house from the total number of blocks he had (79). So, 14 + 11 = 25, which means Randy has 79 - 25 = 54 blocks left."
Response: 27 + 53 = 80 blocks were used by Randy to construct both the tower and the house together.
"Response: 4
Explanation: Randy used 33 blocks to build the tower and 13 blocks to build the house. Therefore, he used 33 - 13 = 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response: 3 blocks
Explanation: To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than he did to build the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks Randy had (86). So, if Randy used 79 blocks to build the tower, then he used 86 - 79 = 8 blocks to build the house. Therefore, Randy used 3 blocks more to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response: 23
Explanation: If Randy has 59 blocks and used 36 of them to build a tower, then there are 59 - 36 = 23 blocks left."
"Response: 30 blocks
Explanation: To determine how many more blocks Randy used to build the tower than he did to build the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks Randy had (95). We can do this by using the following equation:
Number of blocks used to build the tower - Number of blocks used to build the house = Total number of blocks available for building the tower - Total number of blocks available for building the house
In this case, the number of blocks used to build the house is 20, and the number of blocks used to build the tower is 50. Subtracting these values from the total number of blocks available gives us:
30 blocks
Therefore, Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."

Response: 28 feet
"Response: 392 square feet
Explanation: To determine how much more carpet Jesse needs, we first calculate the total area of the room by multiplying its length and width: 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, that means there are 149 square feet left to cover (165 - 16). Therefore, Jesse needs 392 square feet of additional carpet to cover the entire floor (149 + 243 = 392)."

"Response: 4 feet
Explanation: To find out how much longer Jesse's room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length of the room. The length of the room is 20 feet, and the width is 19 feet, so we can calculate this by subtracting the width from the length: 20 - 19 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide."
"Response: 2 feet
Explanation: To find the width of Jesse's room, we need to divide the length of the room (5 feet) by the area of the carpet she needs (10 square feet). This gives us a width of 2 feet for Jesse's room."
"Response: 5 feet
Explanation: To find the length of Jesse's room, we need to divide the area of the carpet (10 square feet) by its width (2 feet). This gives us a length of 5 feet for Jesse's room."
"Response: 36 square feet
Explanation: To determine how much additional carpet Jesse needs, we must calculate the area of the remaining space after covering the length of the room with the existing carpet. The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length of the room is 4 feet (which is equal to 48 inches), and the width of the room is 20 feet (which is equal to 240 inches). Therefore, the total area of the room that remains uncovered by the existing carpet is:
Area of Remaining Space = Length x Width = 48 inches x 240 inches = 11,520 square inches
Since there are 144 square inches in a square foot, we can convert the area of the remaining space from square inches to square feet as follows:
Area of Remaining Space (in square feet) = 11,520 square inches / 144 square inches per square foot = 80 square feet
Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 80 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room."
"Response: 105 t-shirts were sold.
Explanation: To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we need to divide the total amount of money earned ($230) by the profit per t-shirt ($23). This gives us a ratio of $230 / $23 = 9.67 t-shirts. Since you can't have a fraction of a t-shirt, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 105 t-shirts."
Response:  The cost of each T-Shirt = $51 / 3 T-Shirts = $17 per T-Shirt.
"Response:  $436.20
Explanation:
The Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $87 per t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game, they sold 47 t-shirts, so they made $436.20 in revenue from those sales ($87 x 47 = $436.20)."
Response: 127 t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game.
Response: 89 x $98 = $87.21
"Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $134 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Explanation: To find out how much money the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game (172) from the total number of t-shirts sold during both games (186). This gives us:

186 - 172 = 14
So, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $134 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game ($78 x 14 = $109 + $25)."
Response: 4570 dollars.
"Response: 
The Razorback Shop made $11200 in revenue from selling jerseys ($156 x 74) during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game."
"Response: 
The cost of a T-shirt is $192 / 157 = $1.20 per T-shirt.
The cost of a jersey is $34 / 19 = $1.78 per jersey.
Therefore, a T-shirt costs $1.20 more than a jersey."
"Response: 70$
Explanation: To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the revenue from selling a t-shirt ($232) from the revenue from selling a jersey ($232). This gives us a difference of $100, which means that a jersey costs $100 more than a t-shirt. Therefore, the answer is $70."
"Response:  The Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $642 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.
Explanation: To calculate the total amount of money the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made from selling t-shirts, you need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the original price of each t-shirt ($51). Then, subtract the discount amount ($8) from that total to find the revenue generated during the game.
$ Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Original Price of each t-shirt - Discount Amount
Revenue = 130 x $51 - $8
Revenue = $642
Therefore, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $642 in revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game."
Response: 3598 dollars.
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop made $60 in total sales during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. If they made $10 per t-shirt sold, then they must have sold 6 t-shirts ($60 / $10 = 6)."
Response:  The cost of each T-Shirt = $215 / 5 T-Shirts = $43 per T-Shirt.
Response:  The Razorback Shop made $139 in revenue from selling T-shirts ($215 x 20 = $4300 - $5).
Response:  The Razorback Shop made $204 x 2 = $408 from selling two jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.
"Response: 
$240 - $210 = $30
So, a T-Shirt costs $30 more than a Jersey."
"Response: 40$
Explanation: To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a jersey. According to the information provided in the question, the price of a jersey is $115, while the price of a t-shirt is $25. Therefore, the difference between the two prices is:

$115 - $25 = $90

So, a jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt."

Response: 19 drums of grapes are filled per day.
"Response: 35840 drums of grapes (rounded to the nearest whole number)
Explanation: To find out how many drums of grapes will be filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the average daily production of grapes (244 drums/day) by the number of days (146 days). Therefore, the total number of drums of grapes that will be filled is: 244 drums/day x 146 days = 35840 drums (rounded to the nearest whole number)."
"Response: 
To find out how many drums of grapes will be filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of drums filled per day by the number of days left. So, if 221 drums of grapes are filled per day, then

Explanation: According to the question, the mailman must provide five pieces of unwanted mail to every block. If he delivers 25 letters to each home in a block, there are 5 homes per block because 25 / 5 = 5."
Response: 180 pieces of junk mail (9 x 20).
"Response: 384 (24 x 16)
Explanation: If there are six houses on a block and the mailman needs to deliver 24 pieces of junk mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman will need to deliver is 24 x 6 = 144. Since there are 16 houses per block, the mailman will need to deliver an additional 144 + 16 = 384 pieces of junk mail overall."
"Response: 70 houses (in a block)
Explanation:
The mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block, so the total number of junk mails given by the mailman is 14 x 70 = 980 junk mails. Since the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, and he gave 980 junk mails, then there must be 980 / 2 = 490 blocks. Therefore, there are 70 houses in each block."
Response: 768 pieces of junk mail (32 x 20 houses per block).
Response: 265 pieces of junk mail per house (19 houses x 30 pieces/house = 570 total pieces / 78 blocks = 265 pieces/block).
"Response: 40 houses per block.
Explanation: According to the question, the mailman must deliver 8 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he delivers 32 pieces of mail to each house in a block, then there are 32/8 = 4 houses per block. Therefore, there are 55 x 4 = 220 houses in all the blocks combined."
"Response: 56 (pieces of junk mail)
Explanation:
The mailman needs to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each of the 12 houses in each of the 81 blocks. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman needs to deliver is:

12 x 81 = 972
However, since some of the blocks may have fewer than 12 houses due to the presence of alleys or other features, we need to adjust this amount accordingly. Let's assume that there are 10 houses per block, which means that there will be 10 x 81 = 810 blocks in total. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman needs to deliver is:

972 / 10 = 97.2 pieces of junk mail per block
Therefore, the mailman should give 56 pieces of junk mail in each block (since there are 56 blocks in total)."
"Response: 252 pieces of junk mail.
Explanation:
The mailman needs to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each of the 17 houses in each of the 16 blocks. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman needs to deliver is:

Response: 3 beads per necklace
Response: 20 beads (4 x 5 = 20)
"Response: 24
Explanation: To determine how many necklaces Emily can make, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of beads required for each necklace. In this case, Emily has 6 beads, and each necklace requires 3 beads, so:

Total number of beads = 6
Number of beads per necklace = 3
Number of necklaces Emily can make = Total number of beads / Number of beads per necklace
= 6 / 3
= 2
Therefore, Emily can make 24 necklaces (2 x 12)."

"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's assume that the total number of snakes in the cage is x. Since there are 95 snakes in the cage, we can write the equation:
x + 61 = 95
Now, we know that 64 snakes were hiding, so we can subtract this amount from the total number of snakes:
x - 64 = 31
Solving for x, we get:
x = 30
Therefore, there were 30 snakes that were not hiding in the cage."
Response: 57 alligators (97 - 40 = 57)
Response: 40 alligators were not hiding.
"Response: 63 (rounded)
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
Total number of animals in the cage = 79
Number of snakes hiding = 24
Number of alligators hiding = 51
Now, we need to find out how many animals are not hiding. To do this, we subtract the number of animals that are hiding from the total number of animals in the cage:
Animals not hiding = Total number of animals - Number of animals hiding
= 79 - 24 - 51
= 63 (rounded)
Therefore, there are 63 animals that are not hiding in the cage."
