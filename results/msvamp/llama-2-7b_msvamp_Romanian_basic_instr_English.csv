Therefore, Jerry has 5 books more than the number of action figures he has."
"Response: 18

"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's assume that each bus can accommodate 30 students. Therefore, if all 7 buses are full, then there will be a total of 30 x 7 = 210 students in each excursion. Since there are 98 students in the school, this means that only 210 - 98 = 112 students can go on the excursion at most."
"Response: 672
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
* The school plans an excursion.
* The school has 84 classrooms.
* 95 buses are full with 118 seats each.
To find out how many students are in the school, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the number of buses and divide it by the number of seats per bus. We can do this as follows:
Number of students = Number of classrooms x Number of buses / Number of seats per bus
= 84 x 95 / 118
= 672
Therefore, there are 672 students in the school."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has 66 students and there are 6 locations in each school bus. To calculate how many school buses are needed, we can divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus: 66 students / 6 locations = 11 students per bus. Since there are 67 classes in the school, we need 4 school buses to accommodate all the classes (4 x 11 students = 44 students). Therefore, 4 school buses are necessary for the excursion."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus (which is 2 in this case). So, 87 / 2 = 43, which means that 4 buses are needed to transport all the students on the field trip."
"Response: 15
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has an equal number of students (since there are no hints about any variations in this case). Therefore, if there are 120 students in total and 24 classes, then each class has 120/24 = 5 studnets. Since there are 84 seats available per bus, we can conclude that there will be 84/5 = 16 students per bus. So, there are 16 x 24 = 432 students in total."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 102 students in total and 8 seats per bus, then we need 13 buses to accommodate all the students (102 x 8 = 856). Since 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, we subtract 22 from 102 to get 80 students who will be going on the field trip. Therefore, we need 4 buses to transport these 80 students."
"Response: 34
Explanation: Let's assume that 8 elevi do not go to the trip. Then, the number of elevi who will go to the trip is:
Number of elevi = Total number of elevi - Number of elevi who don't want to go to the trip
= 102 - 8
= 94
Since there are 99 places in each bus, the maximum number of elevi who can go to the trip is:
Maximum number of elevi = Available seats in each bus x Number of elevi who want to go to the trip
= 99 x 94
= 926
Therefore, 34 elevi will go to the trip."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. Since there are 3 seats in each bus and 111 students in school, we can calculate that 4 buses are needed to accommodate all the students."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If there are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in school, then each bus can hold at most 92/46 = 2 students. Therefore, there are 5 students per bus."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 290 bananas and 87 portocales in Philip's collection. If the bananas are divided into 2 groups of 145 each (since 290 / 2 = 145), then the remaining 45 bananas will be grouped with the portocales. Therefore, each group of bananes contains 3 (45 / 14 = 3)."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 384 portocale and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups of 3-5 each, then the number of groups that can be formed with 10 or more portocales is 345 x 10 = 3450.

Response: 2891
Response: 334 more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace in that day than in the previous day.
Response: 132
"Response: 137
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to the Palace in the last 85 days is X. Since 829 people visited the palace in total during this period, we can write:
X + 45 = 829
Now, after eating a large meal, 45 more people came to visit the palace, so the new number of visitors in one day is:
X + 45 = (X + 45) × 85 / 86 = X × 85 / 86 + 45
Subtracting X from both sides gives us:
45 = (X × 85 / 86 - X)
Simplifying and solving for X, we get:
X = 137
Therefore, there were 137 visitors to the Palace in the day mentioned in the question."
"Response: 3904
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* After eating a heavy meal, they went to see Buckingham Palace.
* There were 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace.
* Rachel found out that 557 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day.
* If there were 188 visitors the day before, how many visited Buckingham Palace in 57 days?

We can use the information from the third bullet point to find the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the 57-day period. Let's assume that the number of visitors per day is constant (which may not be true, but it simplifies the calculation). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of visitors as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days
= 557 x 57
= 3904

So, there were approximately 3904 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the 57-day period."
Response: 61 more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace in that day than the previous day.
Response: 58
Response: 631
"Response: 368
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* In the day after they had lunch at the palace, 705 visitors came to the palace.
* The previous day, there were 191 visitors to the palace.
* The day before that, there were 457 visitors to the palace.

So, we can write the equation:
Number of visitors on x = 705 (day after lunch) - 191 + 457 =...
We know that the number of visitors on the day after lunch is equal to 705 minus the number of visitors on the previous day plus the number of visitors on the day before that.
Substituting the values, we get:
705 = 191 + 457
Solving for ""x"", we get:
x = 368
Therefore, there were 368 more visitors to the palace on the day after lunch than there were in the 245 days preceding it."

Explanation: According to the passage, there are 22 aquariums for saltwater animals and 74 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 46 animals in it, so the total number of animals is 22 x 46 = 936, plus 74 x 46 = 3368. Therefore, Tyler has 3368 - 936 = 2432 animals."

"Response: 
The postman should give 30 pieces of undeliverable mail to each of the 78 neighborhoods. If there are 19 houses per building, how many pieces of undeliverable mail should he give to each house?

Explanation:
To determine how many pieces of undeliverable mail the postman should give to each house in a building with 19 houses, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of houses in the building. In this case, if the postman needs to deliver 30 pieces of undeliverable mail to each of the 78 neighborhoods, and there are 19 houses per building, then he will give 30 / 19 = 1.6 pieces of undeliverable mail to each house in that building."
