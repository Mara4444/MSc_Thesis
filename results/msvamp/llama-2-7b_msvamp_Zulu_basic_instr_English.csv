Response:  The number of people who can ride on the Ferris wheel at once is 18. However, since there are only 15 people present, only 15 can ride on the Ferris wheel at a time.
Response:  The number of people who can fit on the Ferris wheel at Pharadesi Park is 14. However, if we consider the safety regulations that limit the maximum capacity to 16 people per car, then the total number of people who can enjoy the ride at any given time would be 16 x 3 = 48.
Response:  The number of Ferris wheels at Pharadesi Park is 23 and there are 54 people who want to ride them. Therefore, the number of people who can ride each Ferris wheel is: 23 / 54 = 0.42 or approximately 1/2.
Response:  The number of Ferris wheels that can fit inside Pharadesi Park without overlapping each other is 7. If we divide this number by 2, we get 3.5 Ferris wheels that can be placed side by side to fill up the entire park without any overlap. Therefore, there are 3 and half Ferris wheels that can be accommodated in Pharadesi Park.
