Response:  There are 65 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. So, we have to find out how many red peaches are in each basket.
Response:  There are 11 baskets with 10 red peaches each. So we have 110 red peaches. Then add 18 green peaches to that number. We get 120 total peaches.
Response:  There are 6 baskets with 16 red peaches each. So, we have 1/6 * 16 = 8 red peaches in total.
Response:  There are 7 baskets with 10 red peaches each. So we have 70 red peaches total. Now let's add up all the green peaches for that number. We need to find out how many green peaches are in the whole set. Since there are only two green peaches per basket, then we can say that there are 2 * 7 = 14 green peaches in the whole set.
"Response:  There are four red peaches per basket. So we have to multiply that number with four to get the number of baskets.
There are three green peaches per basket. So we have to multiply that number with three to get the number of baskets.

So, there are seven peaches in all baskets. We need to divide this number by two because it is not an even number. 

7 ÷ 2 = 4"
Response:  There are two baskets with four red peaches each. So we have 8 red peaches altogether. Now let's see what is the number of green peaches. We know that there are 12 peaches in all baskets. So we need to find out how many green peaches there are in one basket.
Response:  There are 16 peaches in a basket. If we have 13 red peaches then that means that there were 14 - 13 = 3 blue peaches left over. So now there are 15 + 3 = 18 peaches in the basket. Now let's find out how many green peaches are in the basket. Since there is one less red peach than before (3 vs 4), it means that there must be 1 more green peach. Therefore, there are 19 - 3 = 16 green peaches in the basket.
"Response:  There are 15 baskets with 19 + 4 = 21 peaches per basket.
There are 14 * 7 = 84 peaches total"
Response:  There are 10 peaches divided into four groups of three peaches each. So we have 3 x 10 = 30 peaches in total. Now let's divide these 30 peaches among six groups of two peaches each. So we get 2 x 30 = 60 peaches in total.
Response:  There are 6 green peaches, 60 yellow peaches, and 2 red peaches. So we have to find out how many of them are not red. We know that there are 3 types of fruits - green, yellow, and red. Green is one type of fruit so it has 1 less number compared with red. Therefore, there are 5 green peaches left after subtracting 1 from each number.

Response: 
Response: 
Response:  There are 3 birds sitting on the fence. So there will be 1 bird less than storks.
Response:  There are 3 birds sitting on the fence. So there is 1 bird less than the number of storks that have come to sit with them.
Response:  There are 5 storks and 3 birds sitting on the fence. So there is 1 less bird than storks. Now we have 6 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence. So there is 1 less bird than storks. Now we have 5 storks and 1 bird sitting on the fence. So now there are 4 storks more than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 birds sitting on the fence. So there is 1 bird left over. Now we have 4 birds sitting on the fence. So now there are 5 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 5 - 1 = 4 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  The first chapter is 48 pages long and the second chapter is 11 pages long. So, we can say that the first chapter is 48 - 11 = 37 pages longer than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter is 37 pages long and there are two chapters in total. So, we need to find out how much longer the second chapter is compared with the first one.
Response:  The first chapter is 60 pages long and it contains 93 pages. So, we can say that the second chapter will have ( 60 + 93 ) = 123 pages
Response:  The first chapter contains ( 67 - 36 ) = 31 pages
Response:  The total number of pages in this book = (66 + 35) + 24 = 121
Response:  The first chapter is 91 pages long. So it takes 91 - 23 = 70 pages to make up for the difference between the two chapters.
Response:  The first chapter is 35 pages long. So it takes up 35 * 30 = 1150 minutes to read this chapter. Now let's see what happens with the second chapter. It is 18 pages long. That means that we need to divide 1150 minutes between 2 people who are reading together. We get 150 minutes per person. So now we know that each person needs 150 minutes for their own part of the story.
Response:  The first chapter is 53 pages long. This means that it takes 53 * 20 = 1050 minutes to read this chapter. So, reading time for the third chapter would be (1050 - 21) / 75 = 2 hours
Response:  The total number of pages in the book = (31 * 61) + 1 = 1521
Response:  The total number of pages = (2 x 23) - 1 = 120
Response:  The first chapter has 2 x = 8 pages. So the total number of pages for both chapters is 8 + 68 = 82 pages
Response:  In the morning, there were 62 campers who went rowing. In the afternoon, there were 39 campers who went rowing. So, we have to find out how many people went rowing in the morning that didn't go rowing in the afternoon. We know that there are 62 - 39 = 23 people who went rowing in the morning but not in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, there were 52 campers who went rowing. In the afternoon, there were 61 campers who went rowing. So, we have an increase of 11 campers going rowing in the afternoon compared to the morning.
Response:  In the morning, there were 15 campers who went rowing. There are now 32 campers who have gone to go rowing. So we know that 15 + 32 = 45. Now let's see what happened in the afternoon. Some more campers went rowing. That means that 30 more people went rowing than they did in the morning. So, 30 + 45 = 65. Therefore, the number of campers going rowing in the afternoon is 65.
Response:  In the morning there were 30 people who went rowing. So, we have to subtract 30 from 60 (total number of people) and get the remaining 40.
Response: 
Response:  In the morning, there were 39 campers who went rowing. In the afternoon, we have to subtract that number from the total of all campers going rowing (44). So, 39 - 39 = 4. That means that 4 people left their boats for the day.
Response: 
Response: 
Response:  In the morning, there were 59 campers who went hiking. So, we have to subtract that number from the total number of campers going both ways (13 + 59 = 84). Then, add 21 to get the final answer: There are 85 campers who went either way.
Response:  In the morning, there were 29 + 66 = 103 campers going to go rowing. In the afternoon, there were 26 + 26 = 52 campers going to go rowing. So, we have 103 - 52 = 51 campers who went rowing in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, there were 41 campers who went rowing and 4 campers who went hiking. So, we have 41 + 4 = 45 campers going to go rowing. In the afternoon, there are 26 campers who went rowing. So, we have 26 + 1 = 27 campers going to go rowing. Therefore, altogether, there are 45 + 27 = 68 campers going to go rowing and hiking.
Response:  In the morning, there were 43 campers who went rowing. So, we know that 43 + x = 46 ( where x is the number of people going rowing in the afternoon ).

Response:  In the morning, Jack got 6 emails. In the afternoon he got 8 emails. So, there are 4 extra emails in the afternoon compared to the morning.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning + 1 email in the afternoon = 5 emails
"Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning = 1 * 6 = 6 emails in the morning.
Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon = 2 * 3 = 9 emails in the afternoon.
Jack received 5 emails in the evening = 4 * 5 = 20 emails in the evening.
So, Jack received 12 emails in the day = (6 + 9 + 20) = 36 emails in the day."
"Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning = 5 * 5 = 25 emails in the morning.
Jack received 8 emails in the afternoon = 8 * 2 = 16 emails in the afternoon.
So, Jack received 25 + 16 = 41 emails in the morning and afternoon."
Response:  In the morning, Jack got four emails. So he had four emails in his mailbox at that time. Now let's see what happened during the day. He got five more emails in the afternoon. That means he has now five emails in his mailbox. Finally, in the evening, he got eight emails. Therefore, he has now eight emails in his mailbox.
"Response:  In the morning : Jack received 3 emails - 1 email = 2 emails.
In the evening : Jack received 8 emails - 1 email = 7 emails.

So, Jack received 2 + 7 = 9 emails in total during the day."
Response:  In the morning, Jack receives 7 emails. So he has 7 - 10 = 3 extra emails.
Response:  In the morning, Jack receives 9 emails + 10 emails = 19 emails. In the evening, he gets 7 emails + 7 emails = 14 emails. So, there are 19 - 14 = 5 extra emails that Jack got in the morning compared to the evening.

"Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning = 1/6
Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon = 1/3
Jack received some more in the evening = 2/3
So Jack received a total of 10 emails in the day = 1 + 1/3 + 2/3 = 4/3"
Response:  Jack got 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning. He then got 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon. So, we can say that Jack got 6 emails in the day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack got 5 emails and 6 letters. So, we have to add these numbers together. The sum of both is 11. Now, let's see what happened during the afternoon. He got 9 emails and 7 letters. We need to subtract this number from 11. That means that there are 4 more letters than emails. Therefore, the total number of letters received in the day is 14.
Response:  In the morning, Jack got 10 emails + 12 letters = 18 emails. In the afternoon, Jack got 3 emails + 44 letters = 45 letters. So, there are 18 - 45 = 9 emails that Jack got in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack got 6 emails + 8 letters = 12 emails. He also got 2 emails + 7 letters = 11 letters. So, there are 12 - 11 = 3 extra letters in the morning compared to the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters in the morning. He then received 2 emails and sent 74 letters in the afternoon. So, we can say that Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails in the day
Response:  Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters in the morning. He then received 6 emails and sent 8 letters in the afternoon. So, Jack sent 4 + 6 = 12 emails in the day
Response:  Jack got 7 emails in the morning. He also got 3 emails in the afternoon. So, he got 10 emails in the whole day.
Response: 
"Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon = (3 x 2) = 6 emails in the afternoon.
Jack received 6 emails in the morning + 6 emails in the afternoon = 12 emails in the day
Jack received some more emails in the evening = (6 x 1) = 6 emails in the evening.
Therefore, Jack received a total of 12 emails in the day.
So, Jack received a total of 10 emails in the day.
Therefore, Jack received a total of 12 emails in the day.
Therefore, Jack received a total of 10 emails in the day."
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. So it is 9 inches away from the frog. Now let's see what the frog jumps. It jumps 12 inches. So it is 12 inches away from the grasshopper.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 31 inches + 35 inches = 56 inches.
Response:  The frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, it is clear that the frog jumped at least 17 + (36 - 17) = 45 inches
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 25 inches. The frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, the distance between them is (25 + 18) = 43 inches. The mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog. So, (43 - 2) = 41 inches.
Response:  The distance between the frog and the grasshopper is 19 + 10 = 29 inches. So the difference in their jumps is 29 - 19 = 14 inches.
Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, it is 39 - 19 = 20 inches away from the grasshopper.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 25 inches. The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, the distance between them is 32 + 25 = 57 inches. The mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog. So, the distance between them is (32 - 26) = 14 inches.
Response:  The distance between the frog and the grasshopper is 24 + 33 = 61 inches. So the difference in their jumps is 61-33 = 22 inches.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. So it is known that the distance between its starting point and its endpoint was 13 + 2 = 15 inches. Now we need to find out what the distance of the frog's jump was. Since the grasshopper jumped 2 inches further than itself, then the frog must have jumped at least 15 - 2 = 13 inches
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 35 + 4 = 41 inches.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. This means that it was 19 inches away from the ground when it started to jump. So, if we add up all of its jumps (19 + 4 = 25), then the total distance covered is 25 inches. Now let's see what happened with the other two animals. The frog jumped 44 inches less than the grasshopper. That means that the frog's starting point was at an angle of 45 degrees relative to the ground. Since the frog jumped 44 inches less than the grasshopper, this means that the frog jumped 24 inches more than the grasshopper. Therefore, the frog jumped 24 inches more than the grasshopper.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. So it is 39/19 = 2.5 times as long as the frog. Therefore, the mouse jumped 12/2.5 = 4 inches less than the frog.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The frog jumped 16 inches less than the grasshopper. So, the distance between them is (21 + 16) - (16). This means that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches more than the frog.
Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches while the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. So, the difference between their jumps is 18 inches.
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog. So, the mouse jumped 6 inches less than the grasshopper.
Response:  The distance between the frog and the grasshopper is equal to (14 + 37) = 63 inches. So the difference in their jumps is 63 - 14 = 39 inches.

"Response:  The recipe says that there are three cups of sugar, ten cups of flour, and fifteen cups of salt. We know that Mary has six cups of flour. So we can calculate this mathematically as follows:
Mary's total cups: Six + Three = Nine (cups)
Mary's remaining cups: Nine - Six = Three (cups)"
Response: 
Response:  The recipe says that there are 9 cups of sugar, 7 cups of flour, and 4 cups of salt. We know that Mary has already used 2 cups of flour. So we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. This leaves us with 8 cups of flour left over. Now, let's see what happens when you add 1 cup of salt to this amount of flour. You get 10 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add another 3 cups of flour to make her cake.
"Response:  The recipe says that there are 11 cups of sugar, 6 cups of flour, and 9 cups of salt. So we know that:
11 + 6 + 9 = 24 cups of sugar

Now let's find out what number of cups of flour she has used so far:
12 cups of flour

So, based on this information, we can calculate:
24 - 12 = 12 cups of sugar"
Response: 
Response:  The recipe says that there are 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. So we know that there are 12 - 10 = 2 cups of sugar left over. Now let's see what happens when you add 2 cups of sugar to the flour. There will be 14 + 2 = 16 cups of flour.

Response:  There are 66 students per classroom. So we need 66 * 6 = 336 students for one bus. We have 67 classrooms. So we need 337 - 1 = 336 classrooms for one bus.
Response:  There are 57 students left out of the total number of students ( 58 ) and that means we need at least one more student per classroom than what it says. So, for every classroom, we will have 1 extra student. That means we need at least 3 more students per classroom.
Response:  There are 120 students in total and each classroom has the same number of students. So, we can say that every student is present in one classroom. Therefore, there are 120 * 1 = 12 students per classroom.
Response:  There are 102 students in the school. If 22 students don't want to go for the trip, then we need to find out how many seats are left after subtracting 22 from 102. So, we have (102 - 22) seats remaining. Now, let's see what number of buses are required based on these seats. We will use the formula: Number of Buses = Seats / Classrooms/ Bus/ Student. Since there are (102 - 22) seats available, we can divide this number with the total number of seats per classroom which is 8. This gives us the following result: Number of Buses = (102 - 22)/8 = 20
"Response:  There are 11 students in the school and 99 seats on each school bus.
There are 101 seats left over after subtracting the number of students who don't want to go (8). So, we have 100 seats available for those who do want to go on the trip.

So, there will be 100 - 8 = 92 students going on the trip."
"Response:  There are a total of 111 students in the school.
So, we have 111 * 3 = 331 students per bus
There are 72 classesrooms in the school.
So, we need 72 * 3 = 216 seats for the bus
216 + 331 = 556 seats"
"Response:  There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school.
46 * 92 = 4240
4240 / 17 = 2160
2160 * 16 = 41680"

Response:  They had 30 + 8 = 32 bottles of regular soda. Then we add 41 to that number - that's 31 more bottles. So now we have 32 + 31 = 61 bottles in all.
Response:  They had 79 + 53 = 126 bottles of regular soda. So, there were 63 - 53 = 24 extra bottles of regular soda compared to diet soda.
Response: 
Response:  There are 17 bottles in all. Out of these, there are 9 regular soda bottles. So, we need to find out how many diet soda bottles there are. We know that there are 29 apples. Therefore, we can say that there are (17+9)-29=28 diet soda bottles.
Response: 
Response:  They had 72 + 32 = 104 bottles of regular soda. Then we need to find out how many more bottles there are compared to the number of apples. So, we subtract the total number of apples from the total number of bottles. We get 108 - 32 = 96 bottles

"Response:  We know that we have 14 x 28 = 504 cookies.
We also know that there are 86 + 84 = 168 candies in total.
So, 504 - 168 = 352 cookies left over.
Therefore, we need to find out how many bags of cookies we have after removing these 352 cookies from our original 504 cookies.
Now, let's see what happens when we divide 504 - 352 between 14 :
504 - 352 ÷ 14 = 252
252 is an integer so it means that we can remove 252 cookies from 504 without losing any more than one cookie per bag.
Thus, 504 - 252 = 252 * 12 = 3200 cookies remaining.
3200 / 14 = 200"

Response:  Helene baked 527 chocolate chips cookies yesterday and 86 raisins cookies today. So, we can say that Helene baked 527 - 86 = 485 chocolate chip cookies yesterday. Today, Helene baked 554 + 86 = 586 chocolate chip cookies.
"Response:  Helene baked 144 chocolate chips cookies yesterday.
Helene baked 397 raisin cookies yesterday.
Now we need to find out how many raisins were in those two batches of cookies.
144 chocolate chip cookies = 144 x 4 = 480 raisins
397 raisin cookies = 397 x 5 = 1,097 raisins
So there were 1,097 raisins in both batches of cookies.
Therefore, Helene baked 1,097 raisin cookies yesterday.
Now let's see what happened today.
85 raisin cookies = 85 x 3 = 243 raisins
403 chocolate chip cookies = 403 x 2 = 864 raisins
So there were 864 raisins in both batches of cookies.
Therefore, Helene baked 864 raisin cookies today.
Thus, Helene baked 1,097 + 243 + 864 = 2,165 raisin cookies yesterday and today.
2,165 raisins"

Response:  There were 12 people on the bus initially. At the next stop, four more people got on the bus. Each bus cannot have more than 36 people. So, we know that the number of people who got on the bus is less than or equal to 36. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus is less than or equal to (12 + 4) = 14
Response:  There were 8 people on the bus initially. At the next stop, 12 more people got on the bus. So, we have an increase of 12 in number of passengers. Now, let's see what happens to those who get off. Three people got off from the bus. This means that there is a decrease of three in number of passengers. Therefore, after adding up all these changes, the total change will be 12+3 = 15. The new number of passengers on the bus is therefore 8+15=23
"Response:  Initially there were 4 people on the bus.
13 more people got on the bus
