"Response: 594 (step-by-step calculation)

Step 1: Identify the information given in the question.

* Number of girls who were already enrolled in school = 732
* Number of boys who were already enrolled in school = 761
* Number of girls who joined the school = 682
* Number of boys who joined the school = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students currently enrolled in the school.

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 732 + 761
= 1493

Step 3: Find out how many girls are currently enrolled in the school by subtracting the number of girls who joined the school from the total number of students.

Number of girls currently enrolled in school = Total number of students - Number of girls who joined the school
= 1493 - 682

"Response: 90
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of small seats = 3
Capacity per small seat = 16 people
Total capacity of small seats = 3 x 16 = 48 people
Number of large seats = 7
Capacity per large seat = 12 people
Total capacity of large seats = 7 x 12 = 84 people
Now, let's calculate the total number of people who can ride the big bike with large seats:
Total capacity of big bike = Total capacity of large seats + Total capacity of small seats
= 84 + 48
= 132 people
Therefore, the answer is 132 people."
