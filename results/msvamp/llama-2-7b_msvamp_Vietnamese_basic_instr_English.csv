"Response: 170
Explanation: According to the question, Bobby has already eaten 28 pieces of candy and then he ate an additional 42 pieces. Therefore, in total, Bobby has eaten 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. Additionally, the question states that Bobby also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. So, the total number of sweets that Bobby has eaten is 70 (candy) + 63 (chocolate) = 133."
Response:  Bobby has eaten 47 pieces of candy (33 + 14 = 47).

"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ed has 6 more bullets than Doug. So, if Ed has 22 bullets now, then Doug had 7 - 6 = 14 bullets initially."
"Response: 18
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ed has 5 more bullets than Doug. If Ed had 27 bullets initially and lost 3 balls on the field, then Doug must have started with 24 bullets (27 - 3 = 24)."
"Response: 35

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Ed has 24 bullets more than Doug. So, if Ed had x bullets initially, then Doug had x - 24 bullets initially. Since Doug lost 27 bullets on the playing field, he now has x - 27 = 9 bullets. Therefore, Ed has 24 + 9 = 33 bullets more than Doug."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the question, Ed has 29 balls more than Doug. If Ed had 29 balls and lost 17 of them, then he would have 12 balls left (29 - 17 = 12). Therefore, Ed has 12 balls more than Doug."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 19 balls initially and lost some balls in the game. After losing some balls, Ed has 8 more balls than Doug. So, if Ed had 19 balls initially and lost x balls, then he would have 19 - x balls left after losing them. Since Ed now has 8 more balls than Doug, we can set up the equation: 19 - x = 8 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, Ed lost 4 balls during the game."
"Response: 41
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ed has 91 balls and lost 21 of them on the playground. Therefore, Ed has 70 balls left (91 - 21 = 70). Since Doug has 30 balls, Ed has 41 more balls than Doug (70 - 30 = 41)."

Response: 139
"Response: 425
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x male students in the school. Since there are 510 more female students than male students, the number of male students is given by x - 510.

"Response: 579
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x male students in the school. Since there are more female than male students, we can say that x < 281. Therefore, the number of male students is less than or equal to 281 - 281 = 0. So, the number of male students is 0. Hence, the number of female students is 868 - 0 = 868."

"Response: 405
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of girls = 308
Number of boys = 318
Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 308 + 318
= 626
Now, we know that there are 36 teachers in the school. So, the total number of students and teachers together is:
Total number of students + Total number of teachers
= 626 + 36
= 662
Therefore, there are 405 students in the school (including both boys and girls)."
"Response: 4860
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
Number of girls = 315
Number of boys = 309
Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys

= 624
Number of teachers = 772
Total number of people at school = Number of students + Number of teachers
= 624 + 772
= 1396
Therefore, there are 1396 people (students and teachers) at the school."

According to the passage, there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain. If 60 families of birds fly south for winter, then the number of families that fly south is 45 more than the number of families that live near the mountain (19). Therefore, the answer is 45."
"Response: 109
Explanation:
The passage states that ""Có 87 gia đình chim sống gần núi."" This means there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain. If 7 of these families migrate to warmer climates for winter, then the number of families remaining behind is 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, there are 109 families of birds left in the area after 7 families have migrated to warmer climates (80 + 3 = 109)."

If 18 more families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is 265 (87 + 18 = 265)."
Response: 103 (49 + 59)
"Response: 38
Explanation:
The passage states that ""27 gia đình chim bay đi vào mùa đông từ gần một ngọn núi."" This means that there are 27 families of birds leaving their original mountain area to migrate to warmer places during winter.

Later in the passage, it is mentioned that ""Nếu có 41 gia đình chim sống gần núi ban đầu thì có bao nhiêu gia đình chim sống gần núi?"" which translates to ""If there were originally 41 families of birds living near the mountain, how many families of birds are still living near the mountain?""

Since 27 families of birds have already left for warmer areas, there must be at least 41 - 27 = 14 families of birds still living near the mountain. Therefore, the answer is 14 or 38 (since 14 is closer to 38 than 14)."
"Response: 120
Explanation:
According to the passage, 86 families of birds have migrated away from their original location near the mountain towards warmer climates for winter. If there were initially 45 families living near the mountain, then the total number of families that have migrated away is 86 - 45 = 41. Therefore, there are 120 (41 + 45) families of birds that have either migrated away or stayed near the mountain."
Response: 62
"Response: 40

"Response: 358
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul received 110 pens as gifts for his birthday and gave away 90 pens to his friends during the year. Therefore, he has 220 pens left (110 - 90 = 220). Since he lost 412 pens more than he gave away, he must have lost 632 pens in total (412 - 90 = 632).

"Response: 198
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 457 pieces of stickers and 320 pens as his birthday gift. At the end of the year, he had 523 pens left while not losing any pen. Therefore, the number of pens he has is 198 (523 - 320)."

Response:  There are 2 bongs of roses in the vase now. Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, Jessica has cut 8 additional roses from her garden and placed them in the vase with the original 10 roses. Therefore, there are a total of 20 roses (10 + 8) in the vase now.
Response:  Initially, there were 16 bougainvilleas in the vase. Since Jessica added 16 more from her garden, the total number of bougainvilleas in the vase is now 32 (16 + 16). Therefore, initially, there were 16 bougainvilleas in the vase.
"Response: 18
Explanation: According to the passage, Jessica took 4 bōng hồng (bunches of flowers) out of the bowl and added some new ones from her garden to replace them. This means that she cut 4 + X bōng hồng, where X is the number of new bunches she added. Since there are now 23 bōng hồng in the bowl, we can set up the equation: 4 + X = 23. Solving for X, we get X = 18. Therefore, Jessica cut 18 bōng hồng."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Jessica had 15 roses in the bowl and added 18 new ones from her garden. Therefore, there are now 40 roses in the bowl (15 + 18 = 40)."
Response:  Jessica has thrown away more than she has cut from her own garden. Let X be the number of roses Jessica threw away and Y be the number of roses she cut from her own garden. Since there are now 15 roses in the vase after Jessica added some new ones, we can write the equation: X + Y = 34 (since Jessica threw away 34 roses). Now, since Jessica cut 34 roses from her own garden, we have Y = 34. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get X > 0. Therefore, Jessica has thrown away more roses than she has cut from her own garden.
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, there were originally 7 baskets of roses in Jessica's garden, and she cut additional roses from her own garden, making a total of 59 roses. Since there are 20 roses left in the bowl, we can deduce that Jessica cut 31 roses (59 - 20 = 31)."

Explanation: According to the question, there are initially 43 children on the bus. Then, some of them get off at the stop. Therefore, the number of children left on the bus is 21 (43 - 12 = 21). So, 12 children get off at the stop."
"Response: 33
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initial number of children on the bus = 41
* Number of children who got off at the stop = 5 (since there are 5 fewer children now)
* Remaining number of children on the bus = 41 - 5 = 36

Explanation:
According to the question, if Baker made 133 bánh nướng and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than 51 bánh nướng - 133 = 82 bánh nướng that he did not sell. Therefore, the number of bánh nướng Baker made is 82 + 51 = 133."
"Response: 29

Explanation:
Let's assume that Baker has sold x number of bánh nướng. Since he had 54 bánh nướng to start with, we can write the equation:

x + 13 = 54... (1)

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 54 - 13 = 41

So, Baker has sold 41 bánh nướng."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, if the baker made and sold 145 bánh nướng, then he must have made at least 72 more bánh nướng before selling them all. Therefore, the number of bánh nướng that the baker made is equal to 72 + 145 = 217."
"Response: 15 - 140 = -125
Explanation: If the friend of Baker buys 140 bánh from him and Baker has 155 bánh to sell, then Baker will have -125 bánh left to sell after the transaction."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Bánh nướng đã làm 121 chiếc bánh (total number of bread made)
* Ông ta bán 105 cái (number of bread sold)
* Mua 170 cái mới (number of new bread bought)

Now, let's calculate the remaining number of bread that Baker has:
Remaining bread = Total number of bread - Number of bread sold + Number of new bread bought
= 121 - 105 + 170
= 36

Therefore, Baker has 36 pieces of bread left."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the passage, the baker made 13 bánh and sold 91 of them. Therefore, he bought more than he sold. The difference between the number of bánh he bought (154) and the number he sold (91) is 63. So, the baker bought 63 more bánh than he sold."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Bánh nướng made 170 bánh. (This is the total number of bánh that were made)
* Anh ta bán 78 cái. (This means that the baker sold 78 bánh)
* Mua 31 cái mới. (This means that the baker bought 31 new bánh)

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of bánh sold and the number of bánh bought:
Difference = Sold - Bought
= 78 - 31
= 47

Therefore, the baker sold more bánh than he bought, which is 47 bánh."
"Response: 29
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initial number of bánh nướng made by the baker = 110
* Number of bánh nướng sold by the baker = 75
* Additional number of bánh nướng made by the baker after selling 75 = 76

Now, let's calculate the total number of bánh nướng left with the baker:
Total number of bánh nướng left with the baker = Initial number of bánh nướng - Number of bánh nướng sold
= 110 - 75
= 35

Therefore, the baker has 35 more bánh nướng left."
"Response: 250
Explanation:
The original number of bánh nướng made by the baker was 144. He sold 71 of them, leaving him with 73 unused bánh nướng. Then he made additional 111 bánh nướng, bringing the total number of bánh nướng he has made to 214 (144 + 73). Therefore, the baker has made more bánh nướng than the number he sold."
"Response: 327

"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the question, if Baker made 19 bánh and 131 món bánh ngọt, then he made a total of 150 bánh (19 + 131). If he sold 70 bánh and 88 bánh ngọt, then he sold a total of 158 bánh (70 + 88). Therefore, Baker made 25 more bánh ngọt than bánh."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, if Baker made 157 bánh and sold 169 bánh ngọt, then he has sold more than he made. If he sold 158 bánh and 147 món bánh, then he has sold an additional 3 bánh (158 - 155 = 3) and 1 món bánh (147 - 146 = 1). Therefore, Baker has sold 3 more bánh than he made."
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if Baker made 54 bánh and sold them all, then he has 54 - 14 = 40 remaining bánh to sell. If he sells 68 more bánh, then he will have 40 + 68 = 108 bánh left to sell. Therefore, Baker sells more bánh than he originally had."

"Response: 26

Explanation:
The baker bought 139 new bread rolls and sold 145 of them. So, he sold more than he bought by 6 (145 - 139 = 6)."
"Response: 35
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initially, the baker made 62 bánh (bánh).
* Then, he made additional 149 bánh (bánh).
* He sold 144 of them.

So, the number of bánh left with the baker is:
62 + 149 = 211
Subtracting the number sold (144):
211 - 144 = 67
Therefore, the baker has 67 bánh left."
"Response: 55
Explanation:
According to the question, after baking 81 bánh nướng, Baker made additional 92 bánh nướng, resulting in a total of 173 bánh nướng produced (81 + 92 = 173). Out of these, he sold 46 bánh nướng, leaving him with 127 un Sold bánh nướng (173 - 46 = 127). Therefore, Baker made more than the number of bánh nướng he sold by 100 (127 - 46 = 81)."
"Response: 359
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Bánh nướng đã làm 61 món bánh and 167 chiếc bánh, so there are 61 + 167 = 228 bánh total.
* If Baker sells 108 chiếc bánh, then he has sold 108 / 228 = 0.47 or approximately 47% of the total number of bánh.
* Since Baker has sold 47% of the total number of bánh, that means he still has 228 - 47 = 181 bánh left to sell.

Therefore, the answer is 181."

Explanation: To determine how many Nintendo games Kelly needs to give away to have 12 remaining, we can use the following calculation:
Number of Nintendo games Kelly has = 20
Number of Sony games Kelly has = 70
Total number of games Kelly has = 20 + 70 = 90
Number of Nintendo games Kelly wants to keep = 12
Number of Nintendo games Kelly must give away = Total number of games - Number of Nintendo games she wants to keep = 90 - 12 = 78
Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 78 Nintendo games to have 12 remaining."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park. If 20 people can sit together at once, then each seat can hold how many people? Therefore, the answer is 5 (20 / 4 = 5)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, each seat on the Ferris wheel can hold 9 people. Since there are 18 people who want to ride the Ferris wheel together, we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats are available on the wheel. Therefore, there are 5 seats available on the Ferris wheel for these 18 people to ride together."
"Response: 450
Explanation:
The number of people who can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at the same time is calculated as follows:
Number of seats in each Ferris wheel = 19
Number of people who can sit in each seat = 15
Total number of people who can ride on all 20 Ferris wheels = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat
= 19 x 15 / 15
= 450
Therefore, 450 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels simultaneously."
"Response: 60 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time if 10 seats are broken.
Explanation: If there are 18 seats in total and 10 of them are broken, then there are 8 available seats for riders. Since each seat can accommodate 15 people, the maximum number of riders who can go up together is 8 x 15 = 120 people. However, since some seats are broken, we need to subtract that amount from the total number of possible riders, resulting in 120 - 10 = 60 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 6 seats available on the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park. Each seat can accommodate 14 people, so the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 6 x 14 = 84 people. If there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, then there are 84 - 16 = 68 people who cannot join the Ferris wheel ride."
Response:  The number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel on small seats is 14 x 2 = 28 people.
"Response: 48
Explanation: To find out how many people can ride the large seats, we need to multiply the number of large seats by the maximum capacity per seat. There are 7 large seats with a maximum capacity of 12 people each, so the total maximum capacity is 7 x 12 = 84 people. Since there are already 3 small seats with a maximum capacity of 16 people each, the total number of people who can ride the roller coaster is 84 + 3 x 16 = 48 people."

Since there are 35 gifts per box, and each gift contains 4 bamboo sticks, the total number of bamboo sticks in one box is 35 x 4 = 140. Therefore, to make all 35 boxes, the total number of bamboo sticks required is 35 x 35 = 1225. However, since we are asked how many rows Faye can make, we need to divide the total number of bamboo sticks by the number of sticks required for one row, which is 2. Therefore, the answer is 80 rows."

"Response: 560
Explanation:
The number of classes in the school is given as 21. Since there are 98 students in the school, each class has an average of 4.6 students (98/21).
Since there are 7 buses for transporting students to and from school, each bus can carry an average of 73 students (7/7 = 1.0).
Therefore, each bus has 560 seats (73 x 7 = 560)."
"Response: 6720
Explanation:
The number of classes in the school is given as 84. Each bus can accommodate 118 students, so we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students that each bus can hold to find out how many buses are needed. Therefore, the number of buses required = Total number of students / Number of students per bus = 84 / 118 = 6720."
"Response: 13
Explanation:
Let's assume that each bus can accommodate 6 students per seat. Since there are 67 classes in total and 66 students in each class, we need to divide the number of students by the capacity of each bus to determine how many buses are needed for the trip. Therefore, we can calculate the number of buses required as follows:
Number of buses = Number of students / Capacity of each bus
= 67 classes x 66 students/class / 6 seats/bus
= 13 buses
Therefore, the school needs 13 buses for the trip."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of classes = 87
Number of students per class = 58
Number of seats per bus = 2
Now, we need to find out how many buses are required to accommodate all the students and teachers for the trip. We can do this by dividing the total number of students and teachers by the number of seats available on each bus:
Total number of students + teachers = 87 (classes) × 58 (students per class) = 4930
Total number of seats on all buses = Number of buses × Number of seats per bus = 2 (seats per bus) × 16 (number of buses needed) = 32
So, there will be 16 buses needed to transport all the students and teachers for the trip."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that there are 24 classes in the school and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is equal to 24 x 120 = 2880 students.
Since there are 84 seats available per bus, the maximum number of buses required to transport all the students is 2880 / 84 = 35 buses.
So, each class has approximately 30 students (based on rounding off 35 buses to nearest integer)."
"Response: 34
Explanation:
Let's assume that out of 102 students in the school, 22 students do not want to go on the field trip. To accommodate these non-participating students, we need an additional 8 seats per bus (since there are 8 seats per bus). Therefore, we need 34 buses (22 non-participating students / 8 seats per bus = 34 buses)."
"Response: 34
Explanation: If 8 hoc sinh do not want to go on the field trip and there are 102 classes in the school, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is 102 - 8 = 94. Since each bus can accommodate 99 students, the total number of students who will go on the field trip is 94 x 99 = 9260. Therefore, 34 students will not be able-to go on the field trip."
"Response: 48
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students (111) by the capacity of each bus (3). This gives us 48 buses needed for the trip."

Response:  Frank will take 392/14 = 27 days to finish reading his favorite book.
Response: 304 pages
"Response: 135
Explanation: According to the question, it takes Frank 6 days to finish reading his favorite book, which has 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. Therefore, he reads 612/6 = 102 pages per day."
"Response: 137

Explanation:
We know that Frank took 220 days to complete the book, and the book has 555 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages per chapter as follows:

Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to complete the book
= 555 pages / 220 days
= 2.5 pages per day

Now, let's convert this to pages per chapter:

Pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 pages / 5 chapters
= 111 pages per chapter

Therefore, each chapter in the book contains approximately 111 pages."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
According to the question, it took Frank 660 days to finish reading his favorite book, which has 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the total number of days by the number of chapters:
660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter
So, Frank read 44 chapters per day."

Explanation: According to the question, it takes Frank 12 days to read each book, and he has read 66 pages in each book. Therefore, if he reads 50 books, it will take him 50 x 12 = 600 days to finish reading all the books."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the passage, it took Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book. If the book has 112 pages, then he read approximately 9 pages per day (16 days / 112 pages = 9 pages/day)."
"Response: 12 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank reads 8 pages per day, and there are 576 pages in the book. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 576 / 8 = 73 days. Since there are 10 days in a week, Frank will need 73/10 = 12 weeks or 12 days to finish the book."
"Response: 7250

Explanation:
Frank took 30 days to complete the book, and each chapter has 450 pages. Therefore, he read 450 x 30 = 13,500 pages in total. Since there are 41 chapters, the total number of pages in the book is 13,500 x 41 = 569,500 pages."
"Response: 1820

Explanation:
The book has 3 chapters, and each chapter has 594 pages. Since Frank took 607 days to complete the book, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read the book
= 594 pages/607 days
= 0.96 pages per day

Since there are 3 chapters, the total number of pages in the book is:
Total number of pages = Number of pages in each chapter x Number of chapters
= 0.96 pages/day x 3 chapters
= 288 pages

Therefore, each chapter has approximately 288 pages."
"Response: 17

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Frank took 664 days to complete his favorite book, which consists of 2 chapters each with 405 pages. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the total number of days by the number of chapters he completed:

664 days / 2 chapters = 332 days per chapter

Therefore, Frank read approximately 17 chapters per day (332 days / 20 chapters)."

Let's assume that the total number of chuoi is 290 and the total number of cam is 87. If we arrange the chuoi into 2 groups, each group will have 145 chuoi (290 / 2 = 145). Since there are 93 groups of cam, each group of cam has 10 cam (93 / 9 = 10)."
"Response:  The size of each group of camellia flowers can be calculated as follows:
Let's assume that the total number of camellia flowers is 384 (since there are 384 camellia flowers in Philip's collection). Since there are 192 chuoi flowers, we can divide the total number of camellia flowers by the number of chuoi flowers to get the average size of each group of camellia flowers:
Average size = Total number of camellia flowers / Number of chuoi flowers
= 384 / 192
= 2
So, each group of camellia flowers has an average size of 2."

Response:  The store has more than 83 cans of regular soda. Specifically, they have 54 cans of light soda and 83 cans of regular soda, for a total of 137 cans. Therefore, the store has 54 + 83 = 137 cans of soda in total.
"Response: 35
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that there are 9 bottles of regular water (not diet) and 8 bottles of diet water. Therefore, the total number of bottles of water is 9 + 8 = 17.
As for the apples, there are 29 apples. So, the total number of drinks consumed by the family is 17 (bottles of water) + 29 (apples) = 46."
"Response: 34
Explanation:
The number of cans of regular soda is 60, and the number of cans of diet soda is 19. To find out how many more cans of regular soda there are than diet soda, we subtract the number of diet soda from the total number of cans:

Let's assume that the weight of each can of soda is 300 grams (as mentioned in the question).
The total weight of 79 cans of regular soda is:
79 x 300 = 23,700 grams
Now, we know that the store has 4 cans of diet soda for every 1 can of regular soda. So, to find out how many cans of regular soda the store has, we can divide the total weight of regular soda by the number of cans of diet soda:
23,700 / 4 = 5,875 cans
Therefore, the store has 5,875 cans of regular soda."

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after 295 visitors came on the previous day. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on those two days is:
317 - 295 = 22
So, there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day."
Response:  There are 1089 people who have visited Buckingham Palace in the past 25 days if there were 246 visitors on the day before and 703 visitors total.
"Response: 344
Explanation:
If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 666 visitors the same day as Rachel and her friends, then there would be an additional 344 visitors (666 - 100) compared to the previous day."
Response: 589 people. Explanation: If there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and 406 visitors over 327 days, then there would have been 589 total visitors (132 + 406) on the day before.
"Response: 3760
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is X. Since there were 45 visitors yesterday and 829 visitors in total over 85 days, we can write the equation:
X × 85 = 45 + 829
Now, let's solve for X:
X = (45 + 829) / 85
X = 874
So, there are approximately 874 people who visit Buckingham Palace every day."
"Response: 3064
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The number of people who visited Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends went there is 557.
* The number of people who visited Buckingham Palace the day before Rachel and her friends went there is 188.
* There are 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace.

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over a period of 57 days:

Day 1: 188 visitors
Day 2: 557 visitors (including Rachel and her friends)
...
Day 57:? visitors

To find out the total number of visitors over 57 days, we need to multiply the number of visitors per day by 57:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day × Number of days
= 188 × 57
= 10,936

However, since there are 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace, the total number of visitors cannot be more than 71 times the number of days:

Total number of visitors = Number of paintings × Number of days
= 71 × 57
= 3977

So, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over a period of 57 days is between 3977 and 10,936. Since the exact number of visitors is not provided in the question, we can only give an approximate answer as 3064."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day was $x$. Since 600 people visited the palace on the previous day, we can write an equation based on this information:

$x + 600 = 661$

Now, let's use the information provided in the question to find out how many more people visited the palace on the current day than on the previous day:

$x + 600 - 600 = 661 - 600$

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

$x = 41$

Therefore, there were 41 more people who visited Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day."
"Response: 568
Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the question to find out how many people have visited Buckingham Palace before the day of the current visit.
We know that there were 419 visitors on the previous day and 103 visitors on the day before that. Therefore, the total number of visitors on the two previous days is:
419 + 103 = 522
Now, we need to subtract the number of visitors who came on those two previous days from the total number of visitors on the current day (92):
92 - 522 = -430
So, there are 430 fewer people who have visited Buckingham Palace before the current day.
Therefore, the answer is 568."
Response:  There are 365 people who have visited Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days. Explanation: According to the information provided, there were 471 visitors on the previous day, 808 visitors on the next day, and 512 visitors on the current day. To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days, we can use the following formula: Number of visitors = (Current day visitors + Previous day visitors) - (Next day visitors). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of visitors = (512 + 471 - 808) = 365.
"Response: 368
Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the question to find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous days.
The number of visitors on the current day = Number of visitors on the previous day + Number of visitors on the day before that +... + Number of visitors on the day 7 days ago
= 191 + 457 +... + 705 - 705
=?

We know that there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the current day, and 191 visitors on the previous day. So, we can start our calculation from there:

Number of visitors on the current day = 191 + (457 - 191)
= 191 + 266
= 457

Therefore, there were 457 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day."

= 828521 - 800059
= 364789"
"Response: 30542

Explanation:
The number of children from Lawrence County who went to camp is given by the formula: (Total number of children in Lawrence County) - (Number of children who stayed at home).

Total number of children in Lawrence County = 91676
Number of children who stayed at home =?

From the question, we know that there are 61619 children who did not go to camp. Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home is:

Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children in Lawrence County - Number of children who went to camp
= 91676 - 61619
= 30542

So, there were 30542 children from Lawrence County who went to camp."
