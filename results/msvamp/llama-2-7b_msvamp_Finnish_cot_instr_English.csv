Response:  Julia ran with 18 other children on Monday and played soccer with 10 of them on Tuesday. So, there were more children playing soccer with her on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is (Monday - Tuesday) = 8.;
"Response:  Julia went for 11 laps with an adult on Monday and played doubles with two children on Tuesday. So, the number of laps she played with each child is:
Monday: 11 laps / 2 children = 5.5 laps per child
Tuesday: 0 laps (since it was doubles)
Therefore, one child played more laps than the other on Tuesday.";
Response:  Julia played with five children on Monday and four children on Tuesday. So she played with a total of nine children (5 + 4 = 9). Since she played with each child for one hour, she spent a total of 9 hours playing with them. Therefore, she spent 9/2 = 4.5 hours playing with each child on average.;
Response:  Julia played with 14 children on Monday (last night). Then she played with 16 children on Tuesday (today). So, she played with more than 14 children today. Therefore, Julia played with at least 16 children yesterday (Monday) and at least 16 children today (Tuesday).;
Response:  If Julia played more than 12 laps with her friends on Monday (day before yesterday), then she must have played at least 13 laps with them. Since she didn't play any laps with them on Tuesday (yesterday), we can conclude that she played exactly 13 laps with them on Monday. Therefore, the answer is 13.;
Response:  Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and Monday. If she played more with them on Monday than on Tuesday, then she played with 8 of them on Monday.;
Response:  Julia ran 17 laps on Monday, 15 laps on Tuesday and two laps on Thursday. So in total she ran 34 laps with Monenko.;
Response:  On Monday (keskiviikon), she played with 97 children. She did not play with any child on Tuesday (tiistain). So, the number of children she played with on Monday is equal to the number of days she did not play with any child. Therefore, the answer is 97.;
Response:  On Monday (yhdeks√§n tiistaina), Julia played with five children. So, there were 5 - 3 = 2 additional children that she did not play with on Monday. Therefore, Julia played with 7 children in total on Monday (2 + 5). Similarly, on Tuesday (keskiviikkona), Julia played with 9 children. Thus, the number of children Julia played with on Wednesday is 15 - 9 = 6.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia played with one child on Monday (lasted for 14 hours), two children on Tuesday (lasted for 20 hours), and three children on Wednesday (lasted for 30 hours). So, she spent more time playing with two or three children than with one child. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 or 3.;
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia traveled with her nine children on Monday (yesterday), Tuesday (today) and Thursday (tomorrow). So, we have three days of traveling. Now let's analyze each day separately:
Monday (yesterday): Julia traveled with all nine children. Therefore, there were 9 children x 1 trip = 9 children present on Monday.
Tuesday (today): Julia traveled with 7 children. Therefore, there were 7 children x 1 trip = 7 children present on Tuesday.
Thursday (tomorrow): Julia will travel with no children as she is leaving tomorrow. Therefore, there are 0 children x 1 trip = 0 children present on Thursday.
Now, let's calculate the total number of children Julia had with her during these three days:
Total number of children = Number of children on Monday + Number of children on Tuesday + Number of children on Thursday
= 9 + 7 + 0
= 16
Therefore, more than half of Julia's children (i.e., 16 out of 25) were with her on Monday.";
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia ran for 14 laps on Monday, 2 laps on Tuesday, and 8 laps on Wednesday. So, Julia ran a total of 24 laps during these three days. Now, let's compare how many laps Julia ran with her son on each day: On Monday, Julia ran 14 laps alone and 0 laps with her son (since she didn't run with him). On Tuesday, Julia ran 2 laps alone and 0 laps with her son (again, since she didn't run with him). And on Wednesday, Julia ran 8 laps alone and 0 laps with her son (just like on Monday and Tuesday). Therefore, we can conclude that Julia did not run more laps with her son on any of those days.;
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia went skiing for eight days with her son during Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Therefore, we can write down the number of days she spent skiing as follows:
Monday = 8 days
Tuesday = 11 days
Wednesday = 9 days
Now, let's find out which day had more children with Julia than the other two days combined. To do this, we need to subtract the total number of days that Julia spent skiing with her son from the total number of days that she spent skiing overall. So, if we calculate like this:
Total number of days Julia spent skiing = 8 + 11 + 9 = 28 days
Number of days Julia spent skiing with her son = 8 + 11 + 9 = 28 days
Therefore, we see that Julia spent an equal number of days skiing with her son on each of the three days mentioned in the question (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). Hence, none of these days had more children with Julia than the others.";
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia ran for 15 laps on Monday, 18 laps on Tuesday, and 7 laps on Wednesday. So, we have three different values of laps run by Julia - 15, 18, and 7. Now, let's find out which value is greater than the other two. We can do this by comparing each value with the others using basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. For example, if we compare the value 15 with the value 18, we see that 18 is greater than 15. Similarly, if we compare the value 7 with either of the other two values (15 or 18), we see that 7 is less than both of them. Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, it can be concluded that Julia ran more laps on Monday (15) than she did on Wednesday (7).;
"Response: 
Julia played 13 laps on Monday and 10 laps on Tuesday. So she played a total of 23 laps.
On Wednesday, she played cards with 15 people.
So, the number of times Julia played with more than 10 people is:
23 - 10 = 13
Therefore, Julia played monenko (i.e., alone) 13 times.";
"Response: 
Julia played with 7 laps on Monday and 13 laps on Tuesday. So she played with 7 + 13 = 20 laps in total.
Since she played with 20 laps, there is no ""Monenko"" (which means ""more than"") in the statement, so the answer is 0.";
"Response: 
Julia played soccer on Monday for 12 laps and Tuesday for 14 laps. Therefore, she spent a total of 36 hours playing soccer (12 + 14 = 36). Since she played with each child for an equal amount of time, she spent 2 hours playing with each child (36 / 18 = 2). So, Monenko played with 9 children (2 x 9 = 18).";
Response:  Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. Therefore, she spent more time playing with children on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the number of children Julia played with is greater on Monday than on Tuesday.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia played with five children on Monday and six children on Tuesday. So, the total number of children she played with is 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, one child was more with her on Monday than on Tuesday.;
Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. On Monday she played with 4 children and on Tuesday she played with some more children (but not all of them). So, the number of children she played with on Tuesday is less than or equal to 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Julia had played with four children on Monday and 17 children on Tuesday. So, the total number of children she played with is: 4 + 17 = 21. Therefore, one child was more with her on Monday than on Tuesday.;
Response:  If Bobby eats 25 more karkkia after he has already eaten x karkkias, then the total number of karkkia he has eaten is x + 25 = 43. So, initially, Bobby had eaten x = 18 karkkia.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 cookies and then he ate 42 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 70 cookies (28 + 42). Additionally, he also ate 63 suckers. Therefore, the final number of cookies that Bobby ate is 70 + 63 = 133.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 cookies and then he ate four more. So, in total, Bobby ate 37 cookies (33 + 4). Additionally, he ate 14 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of things that Bobby ate is 37 + 14 = 51.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 cookies and then he ate 36 more. So in total, he ate 74 cookies. Now let's consider the number of chocolate bars. According to the question, Bobby ate 16 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can say that Bobby ate more cookies than chocolate bars. The difference between the number of cookies and chocolate bars is: 74 - 16 = 58. So, Bobby ate 58 more cookies than chocolate bars.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 20 cookies and then he ate 34 more. So far, he has eaten 54 cookies. Then he ate 18 additional cookies, bringing the total to 72 cookies that Bobby has eaten.;
Response:  Bobby had 21 cookies at first and then he ate 5 of them. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 cookies left. Then, he ate 9 more cookies, so now he has 16 + 9 = 25 cookies left. Therefore, Bobby has 25 cookies left.;
Response:  If Bobby had eaten 22 karkki at first and then he ate 5 more, so in total he has eaten 22 + 5 = 27 karkki. Therefore, there are still 8 karkki left (27 - 8 = 19). So, Bobby had eaten 19 karkki initially.;
Response:  Bobby had 19 karkkia and he ate two of them. So, he has 19 - 2 = 17 karkkia left.;
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 32 karkki and he still has 20 left, then he must have eaten 52 karkki in total (32 + 20 = 52).;
Response:  If Bobby had initially 36 cookies and he ate 17 of them, then he has 36 - 17 = 19 cookies left. Later, if he ate another 15 cookies, then he has 19 - 15 = 4 cookies left. So, there are 4 cookies left for Bobby.;
Response:  At first, Bobby had 30 cookies and he gave away 23 of them. So, now he has 7 cookies left (30 - 23 = 7).;
Response:  We know that Alan has 7 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons. So, in total, we have 7 + 3 = 10 balloons in the park. Therefore, Alan had more balloons than Jake in the park.;
Response:  According to the question, Alan has two balloons in the park and Jake has three balloons. So, we can write this as an equation: 2 + x = 3, where x is the number of balloons that Jake had more than Alan. Now, we need to solve for x. We know that Jake had more balloons than Alan, so x must be positive. Therefore, the solution is x = 1. So, Jake had one more balloon than Alan.;
Response:  If Alan brought two balloons and Jake brought three balloons, then together they have five balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, Jake brought 3 balloons to the park.;
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons and he brought more than Allan, then Allan must have brought x balloons. So, we can write an equation as follows: 6 = Jake's total + Allan's x. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. We know that Jake brought 6 balloons, so his contribution is 6. Similarly, Allan's contribution is also 6, since he brought fewer balloons than Jake. Therefore, the value of 'x' is 0. So, Allan did not bring any balloons to the park.;
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 more than Allan, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park.;
Response:  At first, Alan had 3 and Jake had 5 balloons in the park. Then, Alan bought two more balloons from the park. So, at this point, Alan had 3 + 2 = 5 balloons, and Jake still had 5 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Alan and Jake had in the park was 5 (Alan) + 5 (Jake) = 10 balloons.;
Response:  At first, Alan had two and Jake four balloons in the park. Then, Alan bought three more from the park. How many balloons did Alan have at the end? So, Alan had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total. Now, let's compare it with Jake. Jake had 4 balloons initially, and then he also bought three more from the park. So, Jake had 4 + 3 = 7 balloons in total. Therefore, Alan had more balloons than Jake at the end.;
"Response:  We know that Alan had two balls in the park and then bought three more. So, at this point, Alan has five balls (2 + 3). Now, we are told that Jake had six balls initially. Then, he bought three more, so now Jake has nine balls (6 + 3). Therefore, Jake had more balls than Alan. The final number of balls owned by each is:
Alan - 5 balls
Jake - 9 balls";
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 5 balloons and Jake had 4 balloons, so together they had 9 balloons in the park (5 + 4 = 9). Then, Alan bought 3 more balloons from somewhere else, which means he now has 12 balloons in total (5 + 4 + 3 = 12). So, the final number of balloons that Alan brought to the park is 12.;
"Response:  We know that Alan had six balloons and Jake had two in the park. Then Jake bought three more balloons from the park. So now we have:
Alan - 6 = Jake - 2 + 3 (new balloons)
Now let's simplify this equation:
Alan - 6 = Jake - 2 + 3
Jake had 2 balloons initially, so he gained 3 new balloons. Therefore, Jake has 5 balloons now (2 initial + 3 new).
So, there are more balloons with Jake than with Alan. The answer is 5.";
"Response:  We know that Alan has six balloons and Jake has three in the park. Then Jake buys four more balloons from the park. So, now Jake has seven balloons (three he already had + four he bought). Now we compare how many balloons each of them have:
Jake - 7 balloons = Alan - 6 balloons
So, Jake has one more balloon than Alan.";
Response:  Firstly, Alan threw five balls and Jake threw six balls into the park. Then Jake bought three more balls from outside the park. So, in total, how many balls did Jake bring into the park? Well, we know that Jake brought six balls initially plus he bought three more balls, so altogether Jake brought nine balls (6 + 3) into the park. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Alan brought 3 inflatable balls and 20 regular balls to the park, while Jake brought 5 inflatable balls and 59 regular balls to the park. So, we need to find out how many inflatable balls and regular balls each of them brought to the park separately.
Inflatable Balls:
Alan brought 3 inflatable balls, so he contributed 3 x 1 = 3 inflatable balls to the total number of inflatable balls at the park.
Jake brought 5 inflatable balls, so he contributed 5 x 1 = 5 inflatable balls to the total number of inflatable balls at the park.
Total Inflatable Balls: 3 + 5 = 8 inflatable balls were brought to the park by both Alan and Jake.
Regular Balls:
Alan brought 20 regular balls, so he contributed 20 x 1 = 20 regular balls to the total number of regular balls at the park.
Jake brought 59 regular balls, so he contributed 59 x 1 = 59 regular balls to the total number of regular balls at the park.
Total Regular Balls: 20 + 59 = 79 regular balls were brought to the park by both Alan and Jake.
Therefore, there are 8 inflatable balls and 79 regular balls at the park.";
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Alan brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park, while Jake brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park. So, together they had 12 + 6 = 18 objects in total. Therefore, Alan had 7 + 5 = 12 objects, and Jake had 6 + 4 = 10 objects in the park.;
Response:  If Allan has five balloons and he gives three of them to Jake, then Allan has two balloons left. Now, if Jake brings six balloons to the park, then Jake brought four more balloons than Allan had (since Allan had two balloons left). Therefore, Jake brought eight balloons to the park.;
Response:  Allan had two balls initially and bought three more, so he has five balls in total (2 + 3 = 5). Now, Jake brought six balls to the park, which means that he has six balls more than Allan. Therefore, Jake has 11 balls (6 + 5 = 11) in total. So, Jake has eleven balls more than Allan.;
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese per day. To find out how many hours he learns more English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages. So, in one day, Ryan learns 6 - 2 = 4 hours of English. Therefore, he learns more English than Chinese.;
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate how many hours he studies each language per day as follows:
English = 6/24 = 0.25 hours/day (or 15 minutes/day)
Chinese = 7/24 = 0.29 hours/day (or 38 minutes/day)
So, Ryan studies Chinese for more than English.";
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends three hours studying English and a few hours studying Chinese every day. So in total, he spends 3 + x = 4 hours per day learning both languages where x is the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. Since he studies both languages for four hours a day, we can conclude that he spends half of his time (i.e., 2 hours) studying Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends 2 hours studying Chinese every day.;
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and a few hours studying Chinese. If he spends twice as much time studying English than Chinese, that means he spends x hours studying English and y hours studying Chinese, where x > y. Therefore, Ryan spends 7x - 7y hours studying Chinese per day.;
"Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and 3 hours studying English. If he spends 2 more hours studying English than Chinese, then... (1)
Ryan studies English for x hours. Since he spends 5 hours studying Chinese, we can write an equation:
x + 3 = 7... (2)
Now, we know that Ryan spends 2 more hours studying English than Chinese, so we can substitute this information into equation (2):
x + 3 = 7 ‚Üí x + 3 = 9... (3)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English.";
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese, he will have studied for a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours. So if he studies for 5 days, he will have studied for a total of 13 x 5 = 65 hours.;
Response:  Ryan has already studied English for 6 hours and Chinese for 5 hours. If he studies two more days of English, then he will have studied English for a total of 8 hours (6 + 2). So, in total, Ryan will have studied English for 8 hours and Chinese for 5 hours, which means he has learned a total of 13 hours (8 + 5) of language during those two additional days.;
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 5 hours and Chinese for 4 hours per day, he will study English for 30 hours (5 hours/day x 6 days) and Chinese for 28 hours (4 hours/day x 7 days). So if he learns English for 30 hours, he will learn Chinese for 28 hours.;
"Response:  According to the question, Ryan studies English for four hours per day and Chinese for six hours per day. If he learns 86 days of language in total, we can calculate how many hours he learns each subject per day as follows:

English: 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours (of English)
Chinese: 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours (of Chinese)
Therefore, Ryan learns approximately 352 hours of English and 504 hours of Chinese per day.";
Response:  Ryan studies English for 6 hours, Chinese for 7 hours and Spanish for 3 hours. To find out how many hours he learns each language, we need to divide the number of hours he spends studying that language by the total number of hours he spends studying all three languages. So, Ryan learns English for 6/10 = 2 hours, Chinese for 7/10 = 3.5 hours, and Spanish for 3/10 = 0.35 hours.;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, 3 hours per day studying Chinese, and 58 hours per week studying Spanish. To calculate how many more hours he studies English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages. So, let's do that:

Total time spent studying English + Total time spent studying Chinese = 6 x 24 (hours/day) + 3 x 24 (hours/day) = 144 + 72 = 216 hours/week

Now, to find out how many more hours Ryan studies English than Chinese, we can simply subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages:

Number of hours studied English - Number of hours studied Chinese = 216 - 72 = 144 hours/week

So, Ryan studies English for 144 hours more per week than he does Chinese.";
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English, Chinese for 2 hours and Spanish for 4 hours. To calculate how many hours he learns more English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent on Spanish from the total time spent on all three languages. So, in one day, Ryan learns 7 - 2 = 5 hours of English and 4 - 2 = 2 hours of Spanish. Therefore, Ryan learns 5 hours more English than Spanish every day.;
Response:  Ryan studies English for two hours every day, Chinese for five hours and Spanish for four hours. To find out how many hours he learns Chinese more than Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning Spanish from the total number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, if Ryan learns Chinese for five hours and Spanish for four hours, then he learns Chinese for one hour more than Spanish (5 - 4 = 1). Therefore, Ryan learns Chinese for one hour more than Spain each day.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and Chinese, then he spends 2 hours per day studying English (since he spends 3 - 2 = 1 hour per day studying English). Therefore, he spends 1/2 \* 24 = 12 hours per day studying Chinese (since he spends 12 hours - 12 = 0 hours per day studying Chinese). So, Ryan spends 12 hours per day studying Chinese.;
Response:  Ryan spends 7 days learning English and Chinese. He learns 4 hours of English per day and 5 hours of Chinese per day. Therefore, he learns a total of 4 x 7 = 28 hours of English and 5 x 7 = 35 hours of Chinese during his trip.;
Response:  On Monday (maanantai), Tiffany had 8 bags of trash. The next day (tiistaina), she found 7 more bags of trash. So, in total, Tiffany had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of trash. Therefore, the correct answer is 15.;
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 7 bags of trash. If she found 12 valuable bags on Tuesday, then she must have collected 5 more bags of trash on Monday (since there are 7 + 12 = 19 bags in total). Therefore, Tiffany found 5 additional bags of trash on Wednesday.;
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected four bags of trash. If she had six containers in total, and she found additional three valuable bags on Tuesday, then we can conclude that she had two more containers than she found valuable bags. Therefore, the number of containers Tiffany found on Tuesday is equal to 2 + 4 = 6.;
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany gathered boxes and bags for recycling. She had boxes and bags on Monday. The next day (Tuesday), she found four more bags in her box. So, on Monday, Tiffany had x boxes and bags. Since she found four more bags on Tuesday, now she has x + 4 boxes and bags. Therefore, Tiffany had 8 boxes and bags on Monday (x = 4).;
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany gathered 10 bags of trash. Then she found 3 more bags of trash on Tuesday and 7 more bags of trash on Wednesday. So in total, Tiffany had how many bags of trash? 
Let's count the number of days from Monday to Wednesday: 3 + 2 = 5 days.
So, Tiffany had 5 x 10 = 50 bags of trash in total.";
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany gathered 8 bags of trash. The next day, she found 10 more bags of trash, and the day after that, she found 4 more bags of trash. So in total, Tiffany collected how many bags of trash? We can use the information given to us to find out: 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 bags of trash. Therefore, Tiffany collected 22 bags of trash after Monday.;
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany gathered 3 bags of trash and each bag contained 10 plastic bottles. Therefore, she had 3 x 10 = 30 plastic bottles in total. On Tuesday, she found 7 more bags of trash, each containing 12 plastic bottles. So, she found 7 x 12 = 84 plastic bottles in total. Finally, there were 44 plastic bottles in each of the 5 bags that she found on Wednesday. Hence, the total number of plastic bottles Tiffany collected is 30 + 84 + 44 = 168 plastic bottles.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples than green apples there are, we can divide the number of red apples by the number of green apples: 17 / 16 = 10 (more red apples). So, there are 10 more red apples than green apples in the basket.;
Response:  We have 5 red apples and 11 green apples. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 11 - 5 = 6. So, there are 6 more green apples than red apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 15 persimmons in total and 3 of them are green. So, if we divide the number of green persimmons (3) by the total number of persimmons (15), we get 0.2 or 20%. Therefore, there are 20% of the persimmons in the bowl that are green, which means there are 3 green persimmons in the bowl.;
Response:  We know that there are three red apples and some green apples in the basket. If there are more green than red apples, then we can say that the number of green apples is greater than or equal to 3 (the number of red apples). So, let's assume that there are x green apples in the basket. Since there are 10 more green apples than red apples, we can write an equation as follows: x = 3 + 10. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10, giving us x = 40. Therefore, there are 40 green apples in the basket.;
Response:  We have 7 red persimmons, 15 yellow ones and 8 green ones. In total we have 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 persimmons in the basket.;
Response:  We have 7 red persimmons (punainen), which means we have 7 x 1 = 7 persimmons with red color. Then we have 71 yellow persimmons (keltainen), which means we have 71 / 2 = 35.5 persimmons with yellow color. Finally, we have 8 green persimmons (vihr√§), which means we have 8 / 1 = 8 persimmons with green color. Therefore, there are more green persimmons than red persimmons. So, the answer is 8 - 7 = 1 more green persimmon than red persimmon.;
Response:  We have 2 red persimmons and 6 yellow ones. So far, we have 8 persimmons in total. Now, let's count how many green persimmons there are: 14. Therefore, there are more green than yellow persimmons. The number of green persimmons is 14 - 6 = 8.;
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red persimmons and 11 yellow ones. Therefore, we can write this as an equation:

19 + 11 = x

Now, we also know that there are 12 green persimmons. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:

19 + 11 + 12 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

32 = x

Therefore, there are more than 32 red persimmons.";
Response:  We have 6 punaista persikkaa (red apples), which means we can write 6 as x. Then, we have 90 keltaista persikkaa (yellow apples) and 16 vihre√§√§ persikkaa (green apples). So, we can write 90 as y and 16 as z. Now, let's find out how many red and green apples are in the corset. To do this, we need to multiply x with y and z. Therefore, the number of red and green apples in the corset is 6x + 90y + 16z = 6(90 + 16) = 540.;
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red persimmons and 14 yellow persimmons in the basket. Therefore, we can write:

Number of red persimmons = 18
Number of yellow persimmons = 14

Now, let's find out how many red and yellow persimmons are in the basket together:

Total number of persimmons = Number of red persimmons + Number of yellow persimmons
= 18 + 14
= 32

So, there are 32 persimmons in total - 18 red and 14 yellow ones.";
"Response:  We know that there are five red apples (Korissa), and each of them has either green or yellow skin. So, in total, we have 5 x 2 = 10 different colors of apple skins. Now, let's count how many greens and yellows among those 10 colors:

* Green: 3 (since there are 3 green apples)
* Yellow: 7 (since there are 7 yellow apples)

So, out of the 10 different colored apples, there are 3 green and 7 yellow ones. Therefore, the number of green and yellow apples is 3 + 7 = 10.";
Response:  In each basket, there are 7 red apples and 3 green apples. So in total, we have 7 x 65 = 455 red apples and 3 x 65 = 195 green apples. Therefore, there are 455 + 195 = 650 apples in all the baskets combined.;
Response:  There are 11 boxes of persimmons in total. Each box has 10 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, if we multiply the number of red persimmons by each box, we get 10 x 11 = 110 red persimmons. Similarly, we can calculate the number of green persimmons as follows: 18 x 11 = 208 green persimmons. Therefore, there are 110 + 208 = 318 persimmons in total.;
Response:  There are six boxes of persimmons in total. Each box has 16 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, there are 16 x 6 = 96 red persimmons in total.;
Response:  There are 7 boxes of persimmons in total. Each box has 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons. So, there are 10 + 2 = 12 persimmons in each box. Therefore, the number of green persimmons in all 7 boxes is 12 x 7 = 84 green persimmons.;
Response:  If there are two persimmons in each box and each box has four red persimmons and three green persimmons, then we have a total of 2 x 2 = 4 boxes with red persimmons and 2 x 3 = 6 boxes with green persimmons. Therefore, there are 4 + 6 = 10 boxes in total. So, there are 10 persimmon corners.;
Response:  There are two boxes of persimmons. In each box, there are four red persimmons and some green persimmons. If there are 12 total persimmons in the boxes, then...;
Response:  We know that there are 16 persimmons in total and 13 of them are red. So, the number of green persimmons is 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green persimmons in the bowl.;
"Response:  If there are 19 red apples and 4 green apples in each of 15 baskets, then the total number of apples is:

19 x 15 = 285 red apples
4 x 15 = 60 green apples
Total number of apples = 285 + 60 = 345 apples
Therefore, there are 345 apples in all 15 baskets combined.";
Response:  We know that there are 13 persimmons in total (4 red + 6 green). Since each basket contains an equal number of persimmons, we can assume that there are baskets containing 4 and 6 persimmons as well. Therefore, there must be 4 baskets with 4 persimmons each and 6 baskets with 6 persimmons each. So, there are 4 x 4 = 16 persimmon baskets in total.;
Response:  We know that there are six green apples and two red apples in total. So, if we divide the number of green apples (6) by the number of red apples (2), we get 3. Therefore, there are three more green apples than red apples.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had four action heroes in his room. Then he added more action heroes to the shelf. If he now has eight action heroes on the shelf, that means he added how many action heroes to the original number of four? So, Jerry added 4 + 4 = 8 action heroes to the shelf.;
Response:  We know that Jerry had 3 action figures in his room initially (Jerryll√§ oli aktionhahmoja h√§nen huoneessaan). Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf (My√∂hemmin h√§n lis√§si 7 muuta action-hahmoa hyllyyn). Therefore, if we add both initial and additional numbers together, we get: 3 + 7 = 10. So, Jerry had 10 action figures in his room at the end.;
"Response:  According to the question, Jerry had four action heroes and 22 books in his room initially. Later, he added six more action heroes to the shelf. So, the total number of action heroes Jerry had was:
4 + 6 = 10
Therefore, Jerry had ten action heroes in his room.";
Response:  We know that Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his room initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had is 5 + 7 = 12. Now, let's count the number of books again - it was 9 earlier, so the final answer is 12 action figures and 9 books.;
"Response:  We know that Jerry had two action heroes and ten books in his room initially. Later, he added four more action heroes to the shelf. So, the total number of action heroes Jerry had was:

2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's count the number of books Jerry had after adding the new action heroes:

10 (initial books) + 4 (new action heroes) = 14

Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 14 books.";
Response:  According to the question, Jerryll√§ was initially 8 action heroes and 9 books in his room. Later, he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of books Jerry had in his room is: 8 + 9 + 10 = 27 books.;
"Response:  At first, Jerry had seven action heroes and two books in his room. Later, he added four more books to the shelf. So, how many more action figures than books did Jerry have in his room initially? 
Option A: Seven - Two = Five (correct)";
"Response:  We know that Jerry had five action figures and two books in his room initially. Later, he added nine more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items Jerry had in his room was:
5 (action figures) + 2 (books) = 7
Then, when he added nine more books, the new total number of items in his room became:
7 + 9 = 16
Therefore, Jerry had more than 10 books in his room after adding the additional nine books.";
"Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action heroes in his room. Later, he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, how many action heroes did Jerry have in total?

Total number of action heroes = Number of new action heroes + Number of old action heroes - Number of removed action heroes
= 4 + 8 - 5
= 17

Therefore, Jerry had 17 action heroes in his room at the end.";
"Response: 
Jerry had three action heroes in his room initially. Later, he added four more and removed some old ones from the shelf. If he now has six action heroes on the shelf, that means he must have removed two old action heroes from the shelf. Therefore, the answer is 2.";
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action heroes in his room. Then he added more and removed some old ones, so he now has 8 action heroes in total. Therefore, he added 1 new action hero to his collection.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures in his room (given). Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 old ones (also given). So, if Jerry now has 10 action figures on the shelf, that means he initially had 7 + 2 = 9 action figures.;
Response:  If Jerry had 9 action figures in his room initially and then added 7 more later, he now has a total of 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in his room. Since the question asks how many more action figures than books Jerry has, we can deduce that Jerry has 16 - 10 = 6 more action figures than books in his room.;

"Response:  If there are initially 6 birds sitting on top of Aidan, and then more birds come to sit on top of him, we can assume that each additional bird represents an increase of 1 unit in the total number of birds sitting on top of Aidan. Therefore, if x is the initial number of birds (6), and y is the total number of birds after they all arrive (including both the original 6 and any new birds that have arrived), we can write the equation:
y = x + x (number of new birds)
In this case, the number of new birds is equal to the number of birds that came to sit on top of Aidan, which is given as ""monta lintua"". So, plugging in the value of ""monta lintua"" into the equation above, we get:
y = x + x(monta lintua)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
y = 6 + 6(monta lintua)
Now, we are asked to find the value of y, or the total number of birds sitting on top of Aidan after they all arrive. To do this, we need to solve for y in the equation above. We know that y is equal to 6 plus some multiple of 6, depending on how many new birds arrive. In other words, y = 6 + 6x, where x is the number of new birds. Now, we are told that the total number of birds sitting on top of Aidan is 20. This means that we can set up the following equation:
20 = 6 + 6x
Solving for x, we get:
x = 14
So, there are 14 new birds that came to sit on top of Aidan. Therefore, the final total number of birds sitting on top of Aidan is:
y = 6 + 6(14) = 30
Therefore, there are 30 birds sitting on top of Aidan after they all arrive.";
Response:  At first, there were four birds on the branch (the initial condition). Then, four more birds came to join them (the event that occurred). So, in total, there are now eight birds on the branch (the final state). Therefore, at the beginning, there were four birds on the branch.;
"Response:  We have 4 eagles and 46 storks sitting on Aidan's back. Six more birds come to join them. How many birds are there in total on Aidan's back?

So, we can see that the number of birds on Aidan's back is 4 + 46 = 50 birds!";
Response:  We have three eagles and two storks sitting on Aida's back. Five more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have... (3 + 2 =) 5 birds and 2 storks on Aida's back!;
Response:  We have 3 lintus and 4 storks sitting on Aidan's back. Two more lints join them. So now we have 5 lintus + 4 storks = 9 birds in total sitting on Aidan's back.;
"Response:  We have two storks and six cranes sitting on the branch. Three more birds come to join them. How many more horses are there than birds on the branch? 

So, we can see that there are 9 birds in total (2 storks + 6 cranes) and 3 new birds came to join them, so the number of birds is now 9 + 3 = 12 birds. However, according to the question, there are more horses than birds on the branch, which means that the answer must be greater than 12. Therefore, the correct answer is 13 or more horses are on the branch than birds.";
Response:  We have four birds and six storks sitting on Aida's back. Two foxes are following them. So, we can say that there are 4 + 6 = 10 creatures sitting on Aida's back. Therefore, the answer is 10.;
Response:  We have three lintu (birds) and four storks sitting on Aidan's back. Six foxes came to them. So, we need to find out how many birds and storks are there in total. Therefore, the number of birds is 3 + 4 = 7, and the number of storks is also 4. So, the total number of birds and storks on Aidan's back is 7 + 4 = 11.;
Response:  We have 6 lintu (birds) and 3 storkki (storks). The total number of birds is 6 + 3 = 9. Then we have 2 varpus (rabbits) following them. So, in total, there are 9 birds and 2 rabbits. Therefore, the answer is 9 birds more than rabbits.;
"Response:  We have four birds and three storks sitting on Aida's back. Six hares came to them. How many more bears than birds are there on Aida's back?

Explanation: In this riddle, we need to count the number of animals that are present on Aida's back. The given information is as follows:

* Four birds (lintu)
* Three storks (storkit)
* Six hares (varpus)

So, the total number of animals on Aida's back is 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, there are seven animals on Aida's back. Since the question asks how many more bears than birds are there, we can conclude that there are no bears on Aida's back, since bears are not mentioned in the riddle. Hence, the answer is 0.";
Response:  We have four birds sitting on Aidan's back and eight storks coming to join them. So, in total we have... (4 + 8) = 12 birds sitting on Aidan's back!;
"Response:  We have two eagles sitting on top of Aidan. Five other birds and four storks join in. How many more birds are there than ticks on Aidan's back?

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Two eagles = 2 (birds)
2. Total number of birds joining = 5 + 4 = 9 (birds)
3. Number of ticks on Aidan's back =? (we don't know this information)
4. Therefore, the difference between the total number of birds and ticks is: 9 - x, where x is the number of ticks on Aidan's back.

So, the answer to the question is 9 - x, where x is the unknown number of ticks on Aidan's back.";
Response:  We have three eagles sitting on top of Aidan. Then two more birds and six rabbits followed them. So in total we have... (calculate)...3 + 2 = 5 birds and 6 + 6 = 12 rabbits. Therefore, there are more rabbits than eagles on Aidan's back.;
Response:  We have 5 birds (storks) and 3 birds (swallows) already sitting on the branch. Then, 4 more swallows come to join them. So, in total we have 5 + 4 = 9 birds sitting on the branch. Therefore, there are more swallows than storks on the branch.;
Response:  We have 6 hawks and 2 ducks sitting on Aidan's back. Three more ducks come to join them. So, in total we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on Aidan's back. Now, let's count how many bears are there. The question states that there are more bears than ducks, so we can assume that there are at least as many bears as ducks. Therefore, there are 9 ducks (including the three new ones) plus however many bears there are. Since there are no bears mentioned in the question, we can conclude that there are zero bears. Hence, the correct answer is 0 bears.;
"Response:  We have three eagles sitting on top of Aidan. Six rabbits and two eagles join in. How many more hippos than eagles are there on top of Aidan?

So, we can see that there are 3 eagles already on top of Aidan, and then 6 rabbits and 2 more eagles join in. Therefore, the total number of animals (including both eagles) on top of Aidan is 3 + 6 = 9. Since there are 2 eagles among them, the number of eagles is 2/9 = 1/4 or half of the total number of animals. So, there are more hippos than eagles on top of Aidan.";
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. Therefore, we can say that the number of pages in the first chapter is greater than the number of pages in the second chapter. So, the difference between the number of pages in the two chapters is 37 (48 - 11).;
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter, we get: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter.;
Response:  We know that there are 60 pages in the first chapter and the total number of pages is 93. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter. Now, we substitute the values given in the problem: Number of pages in second chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.;
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has a different number of pages. The second chapter is 36 pages long, so the first chapter must be shorter than that. If we assume that the total number of pages in both chapters is equal to 67 (since they add up to 67), then we can set up the following equation: Chapter 1 = x + 36 Chapter 2 = 67 - x where x is the number of pages in Chapter 1. Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving for x, we get: x = 31 So, the first chapter has 31 pages.;
Response:  The total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write: Total pages = First chapter pages + Second chapter pages + Third chapter pages. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, there are 125 pages in the book.;
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, and we know that the second chapter has 23 pages less than the first one. So, the number of pages in the first chapter is greater than or equal to 91 - (23 x 2) = 91 - 46 = 45 pages. Therefore, there are 45 pages in the first chapter more than in the second chapter.;
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and we know that the second chapter has 18 pages less than the first one. So, the number of pages in the second chapter is 35 - 18 = 17 pages. Now, let's find out how many more pages are in the second chapter compared to the third chapter. We know that the third chapter has only 3 pages, so the difference between the second and third chapters is 17 - 3 = 14 pages. Therefore, there are 14 more pages in the second chapter than in the third chapter.;
"Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, and we know that there are more than 21 pages in it because if there were only 21 pages, they would have been listed as ""21"" instead of ""53"". So let's assume that the number of pages in the first chapter is x. Since the third chapter has fewer pages than the second chapter (which has 75 pages), we can say that x > 75. Moreover, since the total number of pages in all three chapters must be equal to or greater than 169 (since each chapter has at least one page), we can write the equation: x + 75 + 21 = 169. Solving for x, we get x = 108. Therefore, there are more than 108 pages in the first chapter than in the third chapter.";
Response:  Since there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter is 61 pages long, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Length of each chapter Total pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages Therefore, there are 1931 pages in the book.;
Response:  The first chapter has 10 pages, and each page has 23 lines. Therefore, the total number of lines in the first chapter is 10 x 23 = 230 lines.;
"Response:  The total number of pages in the book is given as 2 x 81 = 162 pages. Since one chapter has 68 pages and the other has 81 pages, we can write:

Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter
= 162 - 68
= 94 pages

Therefore, there are 94 pages in the second chapter.";
"Response:  The number of groups that went fishing in the morning is given as 62 and the number of groups that went fishing in the afternoon is given as 39. So, we can write an equation:

62 + x = 101 (where x is the number of groups that went fishing in the afternoon)

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 62 from both sides of the equation:

x = 101 - 62

x = 41

So, there were 41 more groups that went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon.";
"Response:  We know that 52 men went fishing in the morning and 61 of them went to the lake in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of men who went to the lake = Total number of men - Number of men who went fishing in the morning

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of men who went to the lake = 61 - 52
= 9

Therefore, 9 men went to the lake in the evening.";
Response:  We know that 15 members of the group went fishing in the morning and some others went to the beach in the afternoon. If there were 32 male campers in total, then we can assume that at least 15 of them (the ones who went fishing) were males. This means that at most, 17 males could have gone to the beach in the afternoon (since there are only 32 male campers in total). Therefore, the number of male campers on the beach in the afternoon is 17.;
Response:  If some of the guys go out at 7 in the evening and there are 60 guys in total, then we can assume that not all of them went out at the same time. So let's say x is the number of guys who went out at 7 pm. Then we know that 60 - x is the number of guys who didn't go out at 7 pm. Now, if some of these guys also go out at 9 am, then we can subtract another amount (let's call it y) from the remaining guys. Therefore, the number of guys who went out at 9 am is equal to 60 - (x + y). Now we need to find out what values of x and y satisfy this equation. Can you solve for x and y?;
"Response: 
Aamulla (morning) there were 36 men.
Iltaisin (evening) there were 13 more men.
So, in total, there were 36 + 13 = 49 men present at some point during the day and evening.
Therefore, the correct answer is 49.";
"Response: 
Aamulla (morning) there were 44 men.
Iltaisin (evening) there were 31 men.
So, during the morning, 44 - 31 = 13 more men went to fishing than in the evening.";
Response:  The number of men in the camp at morning is given as 53, and at evening it is 48. So, there are 5 fewer men in the camp at evening than in the morning. Therefore, the number of men in the camp at morning was greater than the number of men at evening by 5 (or 53 - 48 = 5).;
"Response: 
A man went to the sea in the morning and evening. So, there are two times when he went to the sea:

* Morning (33 men)
* Evening (34 men)

Now, let's find out how many more men went to the sea in the evening than in the morning:

Evening - Morning = 34 - 33 = 1

So, one more man went to the sea in the evening than in the morning.";
"Response: 

* 13 men went to the waterfall in the morning. (So there were 13 - 0 = 13 men who went to the waterfall.)
* In the afternoon, 59 men went for a walk. (So there were 59 + 13 = 72 men who went for a walk.)
* Therefore, there were 72 men who were involved in the activity.";
"Response: 

* 29 campers went fishing in the morning and 66 campers went for a hike in the afternoon.
* 26 male campers went swimming in the evening.

So, during the daytime (morning + afternoon), more campers went swimming than went fishing. Specifically, there were 26 male campers who went swimming in the evening, while only 29 campers went fishing in the morning. Therefore, the answer is 26 - 29 = -3 campers.";
"Response: 

* 41 people went to the lake and 26 of them were there in the evening. So, the number of people who went to the lake is 41.
* Among those who went to the lake, 4 people went on a hiking trip. So, the number of people who went on a hiking trip is 4.
* Therefore, the total number of people who went on both the lake and hiking trips is 4 + 41 = 45.";
Response:  We know that 46 men went to sailing in one day. Of those, 43 men went in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, the number of men who went to sailing in the afternoon is 43 + x, where x is the number of men who went in the afternoon but not in the morning. Therefore, the answer is 43 + x = 46. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, three men went to sailing in the afternoon but not in the morning.;
Response:  If there were initially 7 omelets in the tree and Rachel picked 4 of them, then there are now 3 omelets left in the tree. So, the answer is 3.;
Response:  At first, there were four olives in the tree (Rachel). She picked some of them and now there are two left in the tree. So, how many olives did she pick?  Solution: 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, Rachel picked 2 olives from the tree.;
Response:  If Rachel had seven ripe apples in her basket and now there are five left, then she must have picked three of them. So, the number of ripe apples left in the tree is 5 - 3 = 2.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially 8 olive in the tree (Rachel picked two). Now we have 7 olives left in the tree and 6 of them are ripe. So, if we subtract the number of ripe olives from the total number of olives, we get: 
Number of initial olives = 8
Number of ripe olives = 6
So, the number of initial non-ripe olves was 8 - 6 = 2.";
Response:  At first, there were six fresh apples in the tree (Rachel picked four). Now, there are two fresh apples left and four more that are ripe. So initially, there were six + 4 = 10 apples in the tree.;
Response:  If Rachel picked three mature apples from the tree and now there are two mature apples in the tree and 27 mature apples on the ground, then initially there were 30 mature apples in the tree (27 + 3 = 30).;
Response:  If Rachel picked seven apples from the tree and then two new apples grew on the tree, that means there are now nine apples in total (seven + two). So, initially, there were nine apples in the tree (not six as stated in the question).;
"Response: 
Rachel picked two apples from the tree. Then, four more apples grew on the tree after she picked them. So, there are now seven apples in total (2 + 4 = 7).";
Response:  If there were initially x omelettes in the bush, and Rachel took two, then there are left x - 2 omelets in the bush. After she picked two more, there are now (x - 2) + 2 = 52 omelets in total. So, the initial number of omelets was x = 54.;
Response:  If Rachelilla picked 3 olives from each of the three trees, she would have picked in total 3 x 3 = 9 olives. So there were initially 9 olives in the tree.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Rachel picked four olives from each of the four trees. Therefore, she picked a total of 4 x 4 = 16 olives. Since there are seven olives in each tree, the total number of olives in all the trees is 7 x 4 = 28 olives. So, Rachel picked 16 - 28 = -12 olives.;
Response:  We know that there were two more balls than Doug had compared to Eddy. So, if Doug had x balls, then Eddy had x + 2 balls. Since Doug lost some corners, he now has less balls than Eddy. Therefore, we can write an equation: x - d = (x + 2) - m where x is the number of balls Doug had initially, d is the number of corners he lost, and m is the number of balls Eddy has now. Solving for x, we get: x = 19. So, Doug lost 10 corners.;
"Response:  We know that there were more balls than Doug had at first. So, if Doug lost 11 balls, then he must have started with less than 10 balls. Let's assume that Doug had x balls to start with. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Edil had 10 + x balls.
Doug lost 11 balls.
So, Edil now has 10 + x - 11 = 9 + x balls.
We are told that Edil had 45 degrees more than Doug. So, we can write another equation:

Edil's angle = Doug's angle + 45 degrees.
Now, let's solve for x and find out how many degrees more Edil had than Doug:

x = 45 - (Doug's angle / 9)
Substituting Doug's angle as 36 degrees (since Doug had fewer balls than Edil), we get:

x = 45 - (36 / 9) = 29 degrees
Therefore, Edil had 29 degrees more than Doug.";
"Response:  We know that there were six more balls than Doug had initially. So, if Doug had x balls to start with, then Edil had 6 + x balls. Since Doug lost seven balls, he now has x - 7 balls. Therefore, the number of balls Doug has now is:
x - 7 =... (1)
We are also given that Edil had 22 corners. If Edil had x balls to start with, then the total number of balls in the game was:
x + x = 22 (2)
Now, we can solve for x using equation (1):
x - 7 = 22
Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:
x = 15
So, Doug had 15 balls to start with.";
Response:  We know that there were five balls more than Doug had initially. So, if Doug had x balls initially, then Edil had 5 + x balls initially. Since Doug lost three balls at the playground, he now has x - 3 balls. Therefore, the number of balls Doug had initially is x = 8.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially more balls with Ed than Doug (24 - 13 = 11). Then, Doug lost 27 balls at the playground. Finally, Ed found 9 additional balls. So, the difference in the number of balls between Ed and Doug is now:

Ed has 11 + 9 = 20 more balls than Doug.";
Response:  We know that there were 29 more balls in Ed's basket than in Doug's. So, if Ed had x balls, then Doug had x - 29 balls. Since Ed lost 17 balls during the game, he now has x - 17 balls left. Now we need to find out how many balls Doug had initially. From the problem statement, we know that Doug had 36 balls more than Ed. Therefore, Doug had (x - 17) + 36 =? balls at first. Solving for x, we get x = 53. So, Ed had 53 - 17 = 36 balls left after losing some during the game, and Doug had 53 + 36 = 89 balls at first.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 19 balls more with Ed than with Doug. So, Ed had 19 + x balls, where x is the number of balls Ed lost. Since Ed lost some balls on the playground, he now has 8 more balls than Doug. Therefore, the number of balls Ed lost is equal to the difference between his initial amount and his current amount, which is 19 - 8 = 11.;
Response:  We know that there were more balls than Doug had (Ed had 30 extra). Then Ed lost 21 balls at the playground. So, Ed had 30 - 21 = 9 balls left. Now we are told that Ed had more corners than Doug did. Therefore, if Ed had 9 corners and Doug had x corners, then we can write an equation: 9 > x. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So, Doug had 7 corners less than Ed.;
Response:  We know that there were 12 more balls than Doug had initially. So, if Doug had x balls to start with, then he had x - 12 balls after Ed took some away. Since Ed lost 20 balls in total, he must have had 20 + x - 12 = 32 balls at one point. Now, since Ed had 17 corners, and each corner has 4 balls, we can deduce that Doug had 17 x 4 = 68 balls initially.;
Response:  If 408 students suggested potatoes and 42 kitchens, then there are 10 (408 / 42) times as many students who suggested potatoes as there are kitchens. Therefore, 408/42 = 9 students suggested potatoes for every kitchen.;
Response:  If 479 students suggested potatoes and 489 students suggested peas, then there are more students who suggested peas than those who suggested potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who suggested peas is greater than the number of students who suggested potatoes by 10 (489 - 479 = 10). So, 10 students suggested peas more than they suggested potatoes.;
Response:  According to the question, out of 310 students, 185 students suggested potatoes and 26 students suggested carrots. So, the number of students who suggested carrots is 26.;
"Response:  The total number of students is 288 and they suggested different food items as follows:

* Peko (pekonia): 264 students
* Peruna (perunamuusia): 105 students

So, the number of students who eyed perunamuusia is 105.";
Response:  If 457 students suggested potatoes and others suggested apples, then the number of students who suggested potatoes is 457. Now, if 63 students suggested more potatoes than apples, that means there are 63 students who suggested at least one apple. So, the number of students who suggested apples is 63. Therefore, the number of students who suggested peaches is 63 - 457 = -380.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, out of 182 students, 166 students eyed more pekoni than perunamuusia. So, the number of students who eyed pekonia is 166.;
Response:  According to the question, out of 324 students, 324 students suggested potatoes (374), 128 suggested tomatoes (128), and none suggested cucumbers (0). Therefore, there were 324 + 374 + 128 = 626 students who participated in suggesting new food products.;
Response:  According to the question, out of 257 students, 25% (or 64) suggested potatoes, and 30% (or 78) suggested carrots. Therefore, more students suggested potatoes than carrots. So, the number of students who suggested potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested carrots.;
Response:  According to the given information, there are 144 students who suggested potatoes (pekonia), and 79 students who suggested tomatoes (tomaatteja). Therefore, we can say that the number of students who suggested more than one type of vegetable is equal to the number of students who did not suggest any vegetables. So, the number of students who suggested only potatoes is 144 - 79 = 65. Similarly, the number of students who suggested only tomatoes is 79 - 46 = 33. Now, we need to find out how many students suggested more than two types of vegetables. To do this, we will subtract the total number of students who suggested only one type of vegetable from the total number of students. So, the final answer is: Number of students who suggested more than two types of vegetables = Total number of students - (Number of students who suggested only potatoes + Number of students who suggested only tomatoes) = 144 - (65 + 33) = 80.;
Response:  According to the given information, there are 228 students in total. If 337 students recommended carrots and 23 students recommended tomatoes, then we can say that 564 (337 + 23) students did not recommend any of these vegetables. Now, let's consider how many students recommended more carrots than tomatoes. Since 228 students were asked to suggest vegetables, if x number of students suggested more carrots than tomatoes, then the total number of students who suggested carrots is 228 + x. Therefore, the number of students who suggested more carrots than tomatoes is equal to 228 + x - 564 = x - 337. So, the number of students who suggested more carrots than tomatoes is 190.;
"Response:  The total number of students is 450 and they were asked to suggest one of the 66 given options. Since 450 students participated in the survey, we can say that x = 450 (since all students did not participate). Now, let's analyze the information provided in the question:

* 450 students suggested peruna (permutation 450C66 = 1275)
* 38 students suggested peko (permutation 38C66 = 239)
* The remaining students did not participate (let's assume it's 100 for simplicity, although it could be any other number)

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who suggested at least one option:

1275 + 239 + 100 = 1614

So, there were 1614 students who participated in the survey and suggested at least one option.";
Response:  If 218 students suggested potatoes and only 351 suggested peas, then there are 351 - 218 = 133 students who suggested peas. Therefore, 133 students eyed peas.;
Response:  According to the given information, out of 269 students who participated in the survey, 330 students suggested potatoes, which means that 330/269 = 1.25 times more students suggested potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes. Therefore, there were 76 / (1.25) = 60 students who suggested tomatoes more than the number of students who suggested potatoes.;
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.;
Response:  There are 34 girls and 841 boys in school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 841 - 34 = 807. So, there are 807 more boys than girls in the school.;
Response:  There are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, there are 485 - 232 = 253 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys in the school, then there must be x number of boys in the school. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can write an equation as follows: Number of girls = x + 228. Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is equal to the sum of the number of girls and boys, which is given as 697. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation: x + (x + 228) = 697. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 228 = 697. Subtracting 228 from both sides gives us: 2x = 469. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 234. So, there are 234 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls in the school, then the total number of students is 635 + 510 = 1145. Since we know that there are more boys than girls, the proportion of boys to girls must be greater than 1:1. So, if x is the number of girls in the class and y is the number of boys, we can write: x/y > 1 (or x < y). Now, since there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls, we have: x = 635 and y = 635 + 510 = 1145. Therefore, there are 1145 - 635 = 510 boys in the class.;
Response:  If there are 868 students in total and 281 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to 587 (868 - 281 = 587). So, the number of students in the school is 587 + 281 = 868.;
Response:  If there are 700 students in total and 142 more boys than girls, then the number of girls is 700 - 142 = 558. So, the number of male students is 142 + 558 = 690. Therefore, there are 690 males and 558 females in the school.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially 706 children in total (including both boys and girls). Then, 418 of them joined school. So, the number of children who did not join school is:

706 - 418 = 288

Therefore, there are currently 288 children in the school.";
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly admitted girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, there are 946 girls in the school currently.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = 632 + 465 = 1097 Girls Number of boys = 410 Therefore, there are more girls than boys in the school. The difference between the number of girls and boys is: Difference = Number of girls - Number of boys = 1097 - 410 = 687;
Response:  We know that there were initially 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 girls joined the school, leaving us with 50 girls (732 - 682 = 50). Now we have 8 boys left from the initial group of 761 boys, so the total number of students in the school now is 50 + 8 = 58. Therefore, there are currently 58 girls in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 496 girls in total and 910 boys in total. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students (135 + 214 = 349), we get the number of boys left in school: 910 - 496 = 414. Therefore, there are currently 414 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in total. If we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we get 308 - 318 = -10. Therefore, there are -10 students at the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Since we also know that there are 772 teachers, the ratio of students to teachers is 624 / 772 = 0.83. So, there are approximately 83% students in the school.;
Response:  If there are 402 more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys is equal to 739 - 402 = 337. Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of girls. So, if we have x boys and 458 more girls, then the total number of students is x + 458 = 1350 (since the total number of students cannot be negative). Therefore, the number of boys is x = 692.;
"Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in school. If 403 girls joined the school, then we have:

Boys = 362
Girls = 362 + 403 = 765

So, there are more girls than boys in the school.";
Response:  Edward had $18 initially and spent $16 of it. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left now.;
Response:  Edward had $13 and he used some of it. Now he has $3 left. So, Edward spent $10 ($13 - $3).;
Response:  Before Edward used $9, he had $0 (since he started with nothing). Then he spent $9, so now he has $9 - $9 = $0. After that, he spent another $8, so now he has $0 + $8 = $8. Therefore, before Edward used his money, he had $0.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Edward had $16 and spent it on 92 books that cost him $1 each. So he spent $92. Now he has $6 left. To find out how much he had before spending, we can subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $16 - $92 = -$76. Therefore, Edward had $76 before he started spending his money.;
Response:  If Edward bought two books for $6 each, then he spent a total of $6 x 2 = $12. So, he has $12 now.;
Response:  If Edward used $6 for notebooks and $16 for pens, then he had $10 (the remaining amount) before using the money for those items. So, Edward had $10 + $10 = $20 before using any money.;
Response:  If Edward used $4 for books and $3 for pens, then he has $12 - ($4 + $3) = $12 - $7 = $5 left after buying the books and pens. So, Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. Now he has $19. So, Edward spent more money on books than on pens. The difference between the amount of money he spent on books and pens is $16 - $8 = $8. Therefore, Edward spent $8 more on books than on pens.;
Response:  Before Edward used his $17, he had $17 + $10 = $27. Now he has $27 - $7 = $20. So before he used his money, Edward had $20.;
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 jumps in the gym today and David made more than him. So, we can say that David made x jumps. Since they together made 58 jumps, we can write an equation as follows:

Zachary‚Äôs jumps = David‚Äôs jumps + Zachary‚Äôs total jumps (given)
x = 44 + 58
x = 102
Therefore, David made 102 jumps in the gym today.";
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 more painstakes than David. So if David made x painstakes, then Zachary made (x + 51) painstakes. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Zachary made (x + 51) painstakes, and David made x painstakes. Now we need to find out how many more painstakes Zachary made than David. To do this, we subtract x from (x + 51): (x + 51) - x = 51. Solving for x, we get: x = 43. So Zachary made 43 more painstakes than David.;
Response:  We know that David made 44 attempts today and he made more than Zachary. So, Zachary must have made 44 - 9 = 35 attempts.;
"Response:  We know that David made 51 attempts and succeeded in 49 of them. So, he failed in 2 times. Now we need to find out how many attempts Zachary made. According to the question, Zachary made fewer attempts than David. So, let's say Zachary made x attempts. Since David made 49 more attempts than Zachary, we can write an equation as follows:

David's total attempts = Zachary's attempts + David's successful attempts
= x + (49 - 2)

Now, we are given that David's successful attempts were 49, so we can substitute this value into the above equation:

x + (49 - 2) = 49

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 37

So, Zachary made 37 attempts. Now, we need to find out how many attempts Zachary and David made together. We know that David made 51 attempts and Zachary made 37 attempts, so their combined attempts are:

Zachary and David's combined attempts = David's attempts + Zachary's attempts
= 51 + 37
= 88

Therefore, Zachary and David made 88 attempts in total.";
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 presses and 44 rejections. David made more than 19 presses but fewer than Zachary. So, we can say that David made at least 19 + 5 = 24 presses. Therefore, David made 24 - 19 = 5 presses.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 punches and 17 hooks. David made more than 29 punches but fewer than Zachary. So, we can say that David made at least 29 + 1 = 30 punches. Therefore, David did nyrkkeilyharjoituksia (boxing exercises) exactly 30 times.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 53 punches and 14 knockouts. David made more than 17 punches but less than Zachary. So we can say that Zachary made x punches. Since he made 53 punches in total, we can write an equation: x + 14 = 53. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 39. Therefore, Zachary made 39 punches.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 35 presses and 3 throws. David made more than 58 presses but fewer than Zachary. So, if we subtract 35 from 58, we get 23. Therefore, Zachary made 23 presses more than David.;
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 46 punches and 58 hooks. David made more than 38 punches but fewer than Zachary. So we can say that Zachary made x punches more than David. Now we have two equations:

Zachary made 46 punches + 58 hooks = Total (punches + hooks)
David made less than 38 punches but more than 0 punches.
Now we need to find out what value of ""x"" satisfies both equations. Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 19
So Zachary made 19 more punches than David.";
Response:  We know that David made more than 39 pressure points than Zachary because he is mentioned first in the passage. Therefore, we can say that Zachary made less than 39 pressure points. Now let's consider John. Since he did not make as many pressure points as David, we can conclude that he made at least 42 pressure points (since 39 is already taken). So, David made 39 or fewer pressure points.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 pressures and David made more than Zachary. So, we can say that David made at least 51 + 1 = 52 pressure. Since John did four times less than David, he made 4 x 52 = 208 pressures. Therefore, John made 208 pressures.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 15 pressure points and David made more than Zachary. So, we can say that David made at least 16 pressure points (more than 15). Now, we also know that John made fewer pressure points than David. Therefore, we can conclude that John made less than 16 pressure points. Finally, we are asked how many pressure points Zachary made more than John. Since Zachary made 15 pressure points and John made fewer than 16, we can say that Zachary made at least 1 more pressure point than John. So, the answer is 1.;
Response:  If David made 30 more than Zachary, then Zachary made x painstakingly. Since David made 37 painstakingly, we can write an equation as follows: 37 = 30 + x. Now solve for 'x'.;
Response:  If David took 56 more steps than Zachary, then Zachary took 56 - 5 = 51 steps. Since David took 38 steps, together they took 38 + 51 = 89 steps.;
Response:  According to the question, David took more than 40 press-ups but less than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 34 press-ups, then David must have done at least 34 + 4 = 38 press-ups. Moreover, we know that David took fewer kicks than Zachary. If Zachary took 62 kicks, then David took fewer than 62 - 17 = 45 kicks.;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, David took 36 more steps than Zachary. This means that if Zachary took x steps, then David took x + 36 steps. Also, we know that David took 33 fewer steps than Zachary. So, if Zachary took x steps, then David took x - 33 steps. Now, we are given that Zachary took 58 steps and made 33 kranssi (which is equal to 33/2 = 16.5 steps). Therefore, the number of steps taken by David is:

David took 58 - 16.5 = 41.5 steps more than Zachary.";
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, David took 27 more punches than Zachary and 7 fewer punches than Zachary. So if Zachary threw 5 punches and 17 boxing matches, then Zachary threw more boxing matches than he threw punches. Therefore, the number of boxing matches Zachary threw is equal to the number of punches he threw minus 5. In other words, Zachary threw 12 boxing matches (17 - 5).;
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had five pages of math and two pages of reading. So, in total, she had 5 + 2 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had more pages of math than pages of reading.;
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had three pages of math and four pages of reading. We know that she had more pages of reading than math. So, let's say she had x pages of reading and 3x pages of math. Since we know that x > 3x, we can set up the equation: x = 4x - 9. Solving for x, we get: x = 12. Therefore, Rachel had 12 pages of reading and 36 pages of math.;
Response:  If Rachel had to do five pages of math homework and even more reading comprehension homework, that means she had to do seven pages of total homework. So, if she had to do seven pages of homework in total, then she had to do one page of homework for every two pages of math homework plus one page of homework for every three pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, Rachel had to do four pages of homework (one page per two pages of math homework) + three pages of homework (one page per three pages of reading comprehension homework). Hence, Rachel had to do a total of seven pages of homework.;
"Response:  If Rachel had to write seven pages of math problems and she already wrote four more than reading comprehension questions, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many pages Rachel wrote for reading comprehension questions.
Rachel had to write seven pages of math problems, so the number of pages she wrote for reading comprehension questions is equal to seven minus the number of pages she wrote for math problems.
Number of pages written for reading comprehension = 7 - x
Where x is the number of pages Rachel wrote for math problems.

Step 2: Find out how many pages Rachel wrote for math problems.
According to the question, Rachel wrote four more pages of math problems than reading comprehension questions. So, the number of pages Rachel wrote for math problems is equal to the number of pages she wrote for reading comprehension plus four.
Number of pages written for math problems = Number of pages written for reading comprehension + 4
Substituting the value from Step 1, we get:
Number of pages written for math problems = 7 - x + 4

Now we have two equations:

Number of pages written for math problems = 7 - x + 4
Number of pages written for reading comprehension = 7 - x

Solving both equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 3
Therefore, Rachel wrote three pages of math problems and four pages of reading comprehension questions.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, Rachel had to do eight pages of math homework. If she needed to make three more pages than reading comprehension exercises, then...;
Response:  If Rachel had to do 8 pages of homework in total and she did 6 more pages than math, then... (1)...she did 2 pages of math homework. So, the number of pages Rachel had to do is: 8 - 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.;
Response:  If Rachel had to do 10 pages of homework and she was supposed to read more than math, then we can assume that she had to do at least 7 pages of reading (since 10 - 3 = 7). So, Rachel had to do 7 pages of reading.;
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to write two pages of math, three pages of reading comprehension, and ten pages of biology. So, in total, she needed to write 15 pages (2 + 3 + 10).;
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. Therefore, she had a total of 9 + 2 = 11 pages of homework in these subjects. Now, let's find out how many more pages of math than reading she had. We know that Rachel had 96 pages of biology homework, so we can subtract this amount from her total number of pages to get the number of pages of math she had. So, if we subtract 96 from 11, we get 25. Therefore, Rachel had 25 more pages of math than reading.;
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. She also had 3 pages of biology assignments. So, in total, she had 11 + 2 = 13 pages of work related to math and science (biology). Therefore, Rachel had more math than biology assignments.;
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading comprehension homework, and 8 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages of homework she had in biology than in math, we can subtract the number of pages in math from the number of pages in biology: 8 pages - 7 pages = 1 page. So, Rachel had one more page of homework in biology than in math.;
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 9 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading homework, and 29 pages of biology homework. So, in total, she had:

9 + 11 + 29 = 60 pages

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 60 pages of homework.";
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension homework. Additionally, she had 3 pages of biology homework. So in total, Rachel had to complete 8 + 7 + 3 = 18 pages of homework.;
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to do five pages of math homework, ten pages of reading comprehension homework, and six pages of biology homework. So in total, she had to do:
5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages of homework.";
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel had two pages of reading and four pages of math homework. We can assume that each page has a certain number of problems or questions. So, let's calculate the total number of problems or questions for both reading and math.
For reading, there are two pages with an unknown number of problems per page. Therefore, the total number of problems for reading is 2 x? (where? represents the number of problems per page).
For math, there are four pages with an unknown number of problems per page. Therefore, the total number of problems for math is 4 x? (where? represents the number of problems per page).
Now, we need to find out how many more math problems than reading problems Rachel had. Let's call this difference D. Then, we have:
D = Total number of math problems - Total number of reading problems
= 4 x? - 2 x?
= 8?
So, Rachel had 8 times as many math problems as she did reading problems.";
Response:  We know that Rachel had four pages of math problems and seven pages of calculations to do in total. Therefore, we can say that she had $4 + 7 = 11$ pages of math problems altogether. So, Rachel had more than $11$ pages of math problems than reading material ($= 19$).;

Morning: 6
Evening: 2
Now, let's compare these numbers to find out how many more emails Jack sent in the morning than in the evening:
Number of emails sent in the morning - Number of emails sent in the evening = 6 - 2 = 4
Therefore, Jack sent four more emails in the morning than in the evening.";
Response:  According to the question, Jack sent six emails in the morning and eight in the evening. So, if he sent six emails in the morning, then he must have sent two more emails in the evening, making it a total of eight emails that Jack sent during the day. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack sent four emails in the morning and some in the evening. If he received five emails per day, then he must have sent at least one email in the evening. So, the number of emails Jack sent in the evening is 1. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack sent = 4 + 1 = 5.;
"Response:  According to the question, Jack sent six emails in total: three in the morning, two in the afternoon, and five in the evening. So, we can calculate the number of emails Jack sent per day as follows:
Morning (3): 6 / 3 = 2 emails/day
Afternoon (2): 6 - 2 = 4 emails/day
Evening (5): 6 - 4 = 2 emails/day
Therefore, Jack sent a total of 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 emails per day.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack sent 5 emails in the morning, 8 in the evening, and 72 at night. So, we can write down the number of emails Jack sent each time as follows:
Morning (aamu): 5
Evening (ilta): 8
Night (illall): 72
Therefore, Jack sent a total of 5 + 8 + 72 = 95 emails.";
Response:  According to the question, Jack sent four emails in the morning and five in the evening. So, he sent a total of nine emails (4 + 5 = 9). Therefore, Jack received 9 emails during the daytime (morning and afternoon) and 8 at night (evening).;
Response:  According to the question, Jack sent three emails in the morning, four in the afternoon, and eight at night. So, he sent a total of 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 emails. Therefore, Jack sent 7 emails during the daytime (morning and afternoon) and 8 emails during the evening.;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack sent 10 emails in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:

10 = x + y + z

Where 'x'";"y', and 'z' represent the number of emails Jack sent at different times.

From the question, we know that Jack sent 3 emails in the morning (aamu), 4 emails in the afternoon (iltap√§iv√§), and 3 emails in the evening (illall). Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation as follows:

10 = 3 + 4 + 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10 = 10

So, Jack sent exactly 10 emails in total, regardless of the time of day. There is no difference between the number of emails he sent in the morning, afternoon, or evening."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack sent 9 emails in the morning, 10 in the evening and 7 at night. So, we can write down the number of emails Jack sent each time as follows:
Morning (9 emails): x
Evening (10 emails): x + 10
Night (7 emails): x + 7
Now, we are given that Jack sent more emails in the morning than he did at night. Therefore, we can set up an inequality based on this information:
x < x + 7
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
2x < 17
Solving for x, we find that Jack sent 8 emails in the morning and 9 emails at night.
Therefore, the answer is:
Jack sent 8 emails in the morning and 9 emails at night.";
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack sent 10 emails in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of emails = Number of emails sent in the morning + Number of emails sent in the afternoon + Number of emails sent at night

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:

Total number of emails = 10 + 5 + 4

Simplifying and solving for the value of ""Number of emails sent in the afternoon"", we get:

Number of emails sent in the afternoon = Total number of emails - Number of emails sent in the morning - Number of emails sent at night
= 10 - 10 - 4
= 5

Therefore, Jack sent 5 emails in the afternoon.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack sent six emails in the morning, three in the evening, and a few more in the evening. So, he sent a total of ten emails during the day. If he sent ten emails during the day, then he must have sent two emails in the evening (since there are only four hours between the end of the day and the start of the evening). Therefore, Jack sent three emails in the evening.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack received three emails and 64 messages in the morning. Then he received five emails and 54 messages in the afternoon. So, altogether Jack received 3 + 5 = 8 emails and 64 + 54 = 118 messages during the day. Therefore, Jack received 8 emails and 118 messages in total that day.;
Response:  Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 11 messages (5 + 6 = 11). In addition, he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon, so he received a total of 16 messages (9 + 7 = 16) during the day. Therefore, Jack received a total of 16 messages during the day (11 + 16 = 27).;
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in total. This means that he received an average of 5 emails and 6 letters per day. 
Now, let's find out how many emails Jack received in the morning more than in the evening:
Morning (aamulla): 10 emails / 3 emails = 3.33 times more emails in the morning
Evening (iltap√§iv√§ll√§): 5 emails x 44 letters = 220 letters
So, Jack received 3.33 times more emails in the morning than in the evening.";
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. So he received a total of 14 messages in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 9 messages in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received more messages in the morning than in the afternoon. The difference between the number of messages he received in the morning and the number of messages he received in the afternoon is 5 (14 - 9 = 5).;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack sent six emails and received two emails in total. Therefore, he sent 6 - 2 = 4 more emails than he received. So, Jack sent 4 x 9 = 36 emails during that day.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack sent four emails and two letters in the morning. This means he sent a total of six messages (four emails + two letters). Then, according to the next part of the question, Jack received six emails and sent eight letters. So, in total, Jack sent 14 messages that day (eight letters + six emails). Therefore, Jack labeled 14 emails per day.;
Response:  If Jack sent 9 emails per day and he received 7 emails in the morning, then he had 2 extra emails to send in the afternoon. So, Jack sent 9 - 7 = 2 more emails in the afternoon.;
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack sent three emails at lunchtime and five emails at breakfast time. Therefore, we can write down the following equation:
3 + 5 = x (where x represents the number of emails Jack sent in the evening)
Now, according to the question, Jack also sent 16 emails in the evening. So, we can add this value to our previous equation:
3 + 5 + 16 = x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 24
Therefore, Jack sent 24 emails in total.";
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack sent three emails in the afternoon and six emails in the morning. Therefore, he sent a total of 3 + 6 = 9 emails that day. So, Jack received 10 - 9 = 1 email in the evening.;
Response:  The length of a grasshopper is 30 cm (according to the question). If the cricket jumped 15 cm and the frog 15 cm, then the distance between them would be: Grasshopper + Cricket = 30 cm + 15 cm = 45 cm. So, the frog jumped as far as the grasshopper.;
"Response:  The length of a ""tuuma"" is not given in the problem statement, so we cannot use it directly to calculate the distance traveled by the frog and the snake. However, we can convert both distances into meters using the conversion factor provided earlier.

The length of 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters (cm), and there are 10 cm in 1 decimeter (dm). Therefore, we can convert the distances as follows:

* Tuuma = 100 cm
* Meter = 1000 cm / 10 = 100 m

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by each creature:

Frog: The frog jumped 31 tuumaa, which is equal to 3100 cm or 31 meters (using the conversion factor above).
Snake: The snake slid 35 tuumaa, which is equal to 3500 cm or 35 meters (using the conversion factor above).

Therefore, the total distance traveled by both creatures is:

Total distance = Frog distance + Snake distance
= 31 meters + 35 meters
= 66 meters";
Response:  The total distance that all three animals jumped is given as 10 + 17 + 15 = 42 centimeters. Since the hein√§t√§rkk√§ and the hare both jumped 10 centimeters, we can say that the sum of their jumps is equal to the total distance they jumped. So, the distance that the sammakko jumped must be equal to 42 - (10 + 10) = 22 centimeters. Therefore, the sammakko jumped 22 centimeters.;
"Response:  The distance that the frog jumped is given as 25 tuumaa (or 25 cm). Since the frog jumped farther than the snake and the mouse combined, we can say that the sum of their jumps is less than or equal to the distance that the frog jumped. Therefore, we have:

Distance = 25 cm + (18 cm + 2 cm) = 45 cm

So, the mouse jumped 23 cm (45 cm - 22 cm).";
Response:  The total distance that all three animals jumped is given as 60 cm (30 + 10 + 20). Since the snake and the frog both jumped farther than the hare, we can say that the sum of their distances equals the total distance. So, if the snake jumped x cm and the frog jumped y cm, then together they jumped x + y cm. Now, since the hare only jumped half as far as the snake, it means that the hare jumped x/2 cm. Therefore, the distance that the hare jumped is equal to half of the total distance, which is 30 + 10 + 20 = 60 cm. So, the hare jumped 60 / 2 = 30 cm.;
"Response:  The total distance that all three animals jumped is given as 30 + 39 + 94 = 163 cm. So, if we divide this total distance among the three animals, we get:
Sammakko: 39/3 = 13 cm
Hein√§sirkka: 30/3 = 10 cm
Hiiri: 94/3 = 31 cm
Therefore, the answer is: Sammakko hypp√§si 13 cm, hein√§sirkka 10 cm, and hiiri 31 cm.";
Response:  We know that the total distance of all three jumps is equal to 25 + 32 + 26 = 83 tuumaa (or feet). Since the hein√§ sirkka and the hiiri together made a jump of 26 tuuma less than the sum of the other two jumps, we can say that the hiiri's jump was 83 - 26 = 57 tuumaa (or feet) long.;
Response:  We know that the total distance traveled by all three animals together is 33 + 5 = 38 tuumaa (or 140 inches). Since the snake and frog traveled together for 30 seconds, their combined distance traveled would be half of the total distance, or 38 / 2 = 19 tuumaa (or 76 inches). Therefore, the hippo traveled 19 - 5 = 14 tuumaa (or 56 inches) further than the frog. So, the answer is 14 inches.;
Response:  The hare jumped 13 times its own length and the attacker jumped twice as far as the hare. So if the hare is x meters long, then the attacker jumped 2x meters away from it. Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog is x + 2x = 3x meters.;
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 35 cm and the cricket jumped 10 cm more than the grasshopper. So, the total distance traveled by both insects is: 35 + (10 + 10) = 65 cm.;
Response:  The total distance that all three animals jumped is given as 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm. Since the rat jumped 10 cm more than the frog and the frog jumped 16 cm less than the frog, we can write: Rat's jump distance = Frog's jump distance + 10 cm = 40 cm + 10 cm = 50 cm. So, the frog jumped 20 cm (= 40 cm - 20 cm).;
Response:  The total distance that all three animals jumped is given as 40 cm + 19 cm = 59 cm. Since the rat jumped 12 cm less than the frog and the frog jumped 38 cm more than the mouse, we can write: Rat jumped x cm, Frog jumped 38 + x cm, Mouse jumped x cm. Now we have two equations: x + 12 = 59 (from the rat) and 38 + x = 59 (from the frog). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 27 cm, so the mouse jumped 27 cm.;
"Response:  The distance that Hein√§Sirkka jumped is given as x in the problem statement. We know that Rotta jumped 25 tuumaa (or 25 cm) more than Sammakko and Hiiri combined. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 25 = 3(16)

Here, x represents the distance that Hein√§Sirkka jumped, and 3 represents the number of times that Sammakko and Hiiri jumped together (since they are both shorter than Roatta). Solving for x gives us:

x = 49

So, Hein√§Sirkka jumped 49 cm (or 49 units) further than Hiisi.";
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. To find out how many times the frog jumped farther than the grasshopper, we can divide the distance the frog jumped by the distance the grasshopper jumped: 39 / 17 = 2.29. So, the frog jumped about 2.29 times farther than the grasshopper.;
Response:  The distance that the frog jumped is given as 20 cm more than the distance that the mouse jumped. So if the mouse jumped x cm, the frog jumped x + 20 cm. Therefore, the distance that the hare jumped is equal to the difference between the distances jumped by the frog and the mouse: x + 20 - (x - 10) = 30 cm. Solving for x, we get x = 40 cm. So the hare jumped 40 cm.;
"Response:  We know that the total distance traveled is given as x + 16 = 37 (since the sammakko traveled 16 more than the hiisi). So we can write an equation:
x + 16 = 37...(1)
Now we are told that the hiisi traveled less than the snake. This means that the difference between the two distances must be equal to the distance traveled by the snake minus the distance traveled by the hiisi. Therefore, we have:
x - 16 = 37 - 16...(2)
Solving for x in either of these equations will give us the answer. For example, if we solve (1), we get x = 59. If we solve (2), we also get x = 59. So the answer is 59.";
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 14 cups of flour and she has already prepared 5 cups. So, to find out how many more cups she needs, we can subtract the number of cups she has from the total amount needed:

14 - 5 = 9

Therefore, Mary needs 9 more cups of flour.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour and needs to add more sugar than flour. So, we can start with the given information as follows:
Mary has 4 cups of flour (which is equal to 9/4 = 2.25 cups of sugar)
So, she still needs 7.75 cups of sugar (9 - 2.25 = 7.75).";
Response:  We know that Mary has already brought six cups of flour and needs eight more cups to make the recipe. So, she needs an additional four cups of flour. Therefore, the answer is 4 cups.;
Response:  If Mary has already brought 11 cups of flour and needs 2 more cups for the recipe to require 13 cups in total, then she must have brought 9 cups of flour (since 11 + 2 = 13).;
Response:  The recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and a few cups of flour. Mary has already put 3 cups of flour in. So, to find out how many cups of flour are left, we need to subtract the amount she has from the total required. In this case, there are 8 cups of flour remaining (11 - 3 = 8). Therefore, the recipe requires 8 cups of flour.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already brought 12 cups of flour and needs 2 more to make 15 cups in total. So, she must have brought 14 cups of flour initially. Therefore, the number of cups of flour Mary has brought is 14.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to make the cake. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount needed (9 - 3 = 6). So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour to make the cake.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 kupillita of sugar to the mixture and she needs to add how many more kupillitas of sugar to make 14 kupillitas in total? So we can calculate it as follows:
Mary has already added = 2 kupillita
Total amount of sugar needed = 14 - 2 = 12 kupillitas
Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 kupillitas of sugar to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary needs to make 12 cups of tea and she has already prepared 11 cups of tea leaves. So, we need to find out how many more cups of tea leaves Mary needs to prepare. To do this, we can divide the total number of cups needed (12) by the number of cups Mary has prepared so far (11). This gives us an additional amount of tea leaves that Mary needs to prepare: 12 - 11 = 1 cup. Therefore, Mary needs one extra cup of tea leaves to complete the recipe.;
"Response:  We know that Mary needs to make 10 cups of tea and she has already prepared 7 cups of tea leaves. So, we need to find out how many more cups of tea leaves Mary needs to prepare. To do this, we can divide the total number of cups needed (10) by the number of cups Mary has already prepared (7):

Number of additional cups = Total number of cups / Number of cups prepared = 10 / 7 = 2
So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of tea leaves to make the remaining 3 cups of tea.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of flour to make the dough. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of flour needed = (Amount of flour in recipe) - (Number of cups already used)

In this case, the total amount of flour needed is:

Total amount of flour needed = 12 cups x 140 grams/cup + 7 cups x 85 grams/cup = 1680 grams - 2 cups x 140 grams/cup = 960 grams

Therefore, Mary needs an additional 960 grams of flour to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added five cups of flour to her recipe and she needs six more cups to make six cups of flour in total. Similarly, she needs eight more cups of sugar than the number of cups of flour she needs, so she needs seven cups of sugar in total. However, we are told that she only needs seven cups of salt, which is less than the difference between the number of cups of sugar she needs and the number of cups of flour she needs. Therefore, Mary needs three cups of sugar more than she needs salt.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of sugar to make tea. So, she needs to add how many more cups of sugar to make 12 cups in total? To find out, we can divide the number of cups required (12) by the number of cups Mary has already added (2). Therefore, Mary needs to add 9 more cups of sugar.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the mixture and she needs 5 more cups to complete the recipe. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Mary needs 5 - 4 = 1 additional cup of sugar.";
Response:  We know that Mary needs six cups of sugar and nine cups of flour to make the cake recipe. She has already added two cups of flour. So, she needs seven more cups of flour (9 - 2 = 7).;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour and needs to add 4 more cups of sugar (since she has 5 cups of sugar required). So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to be added after adding 11 cups of flour.

Let's assume that the recipe requires x cups of sugar. Since Mary has already added 11 cups of flour, we can write an equation as follows:

x - 11 = 5

Now, let's solve for 'x':

x = 16

So, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has brought three cups of sugar and ten cups of flour with her. If she needs five more cups of flour than sugar, then... (1)

We can start by using the information given in the problem to set up an equation. For example, we know that Mary has brought three cups of sugar, so we can write:

3 = x (where x is the number of cups of sugar Mary needs)

Similarly, we know that Mary has brought ten cups of flour, so we can write:

x + 10 = y (where y is the number of cups of flour Mary needs)

Now, let's solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. Since we want to find out how many cups of flour Mary has brought, we will use substitution. So, we will substitute the first equation into the second one:

3 = x
x + 10 = y

Substituting the value of x from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

3 + 10 = y

Solving for y, we get:

y = 13

So, Mary has brought 13 cups of flour. To find out how many cups of sugar she needs, we can simply subtract the amount of flour she has brought from the total amount of flour required:

Number of cups of sugar needed = Total number of cups of flour required - Number of cups of flour brought by Mary
= 15 - 13
= 2

Therefore, Mary needs two cups of sugar.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already brought 13 cups of flour and needs 12 more to make the recipe. So, the total number of cups of flour Mary has is:

13 + 12 = 25 cups of flour

Therefore, Mary has brought 25 cups of flour with her.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and needs to add more. To find out how many cups she needs to add, we can use the following formula:

Total amount of flour needed = Total amount of flour in the recipe - Amount already added

In this case, the total amount of flour in the recipe is 14 cups (since there are 14 cups of flour listed in the recipe). The amount already added by Mary is 7 cups. So, to find out how many cups Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount already added from the total amount of flour needed:

Number of cups Mary needs to add = Total amount of flour needed - Amount already added
= 14 - 7
= 7

Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 additional cups of flour to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and needs to add more. To find out how many cups she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has from the total amount needed (11 - 10 = 1). So, Mary needs to add 1 cup of sugar.;
"Response:  We know that Mary needs to make 3 cups of tea and she has already prepared 6 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to prepare. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour needed (10 cups) by the number of cups she has already prepared (6 cups):

10 cups / 6 cups = 1.67 cups
So, Mary needs to prepare 1.67 more cups of flour.";
Response:  We know that Mary needs to make 9 cups of tea using 14 cups of sugar and 40 cups of salt. She has already added 4 cups of sugar. So, she needs to add how many more cups of sugar? = 9 - 4 = 5 cups of sugar.;
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 9 cups of sugar for her recipe and she has already added 2 cups of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (9 cups) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2 cups):

Number of additional cups = Total amount / Amount already added = 9 / 2 = 4.5
Since you cannot have a fraction of a cup, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 5 cups of sugar to complete her recipe.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour (which is equal to 3 times 4 cups). Now we need to find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add more than the amount of salt she has. So, let's subtract the number of cups of salt from the total number of cups of ingredients needed:

Total number of cups of ingredients needed = 11 cups of sugar + 6 cups of butter + 9 cups of salt = 26 cups

Number of cups of sugar Mary has already added = 12 cups

So, the difference between the total number of cups of ingredients needed and the number of cups of sugar Mary has already added is:

Difference = Total number of cups of ingredients needed - Number of cups of sugar Mary has already added = 26 cups - 12 cups = 14 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 14 cups of sugar more than the amount of salt she has.";
Response:  We know that Mary needs to make 7 cups of tea and she has already prepared 4 cups of tea. So, we need to find out how many more cups she needs to prepare. To do this, we can divide the total number of cups needed (7) by the number of cups she has already prepared (4). This gives us 1 3/4 or 1.75 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to prepare 1 3/4 cups of tea more.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and she needs to add 2 more cups (since the recipe requires 12 cups). So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 2 cups.;
Response:  If there are currently 19 lintuer families living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer climates during winter, then in total we have 19 x 60 = 1140 lintuer families that migrated. Now, if 60 additional lintuer families came from elsewhere to join them, then the total number of lintuer families that migrated would be 1140 + 60 = 1200. Therefore, 360 more lintuer families migrated than those who remained behind.;
Response:  We know that there are 87 bird families near the mountain and that most of them migrate to warmer areas during winter. If 7 bird families flew away for winter, then we can assume that 80 bird families remained behind (87 - 7 = 80). Therefore, 80 bird families stayed in the area during winter.;
Response:  We know that 20 lintuerperhet left for warmer climates during winter and only 14 remained at the mountain. So, initially there were 20 + 14 = 34 lintuerperhet at the mountain.;
"Response:  We know that 85 birds live near the mountain and we are asked how many birds remain after some of them leave for Africa or Asia. If 23 birds left for Africa and 37 birds left for Asia, then the number of birds remaining near the mountain is:

Number of birds remaining = 85 - (23 + 37)
= 85 - 60
= 25

Therefore, there are 25 birds remaining near the mountain.";
"Response:  We know that there are eight birds near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer climates. If 42 birds left for Africa and 31 birds left for Asia, then we can say that:

Number of birds that left for Africa = 42
Number of birds that left for Asia = 31

Now, let's find out how many more birds left for Africa than for Asia:

More birds left for Africa = Number of birds that left for Africa - Number of birds that left for Asia
= 42 - 31
= 11

So, 11 more birds left for Africa than for Asia.";
Response:  We know that there are 38 birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer climates during winter. If 47 birds left for Africa and 94 birds left for Asia, then the total number of birds leaving for Asia is 94 + 47 = 141. Therefore, more birds left for Asia than for Africa. So, the answer is 141.;
Response:  We know that 38 lintuer flew away from Finland to Africa and 80 lintuer flew away from Finland to Asia. So, in total, 38 + 80 = 118 lintuer left Finland. Now, we are told that there were initially 18 lintuer living near the mountain. Therefore, after all these lintuer fled, there would be 18 - 118 = -90 lintuer remaining in Finland. Since negative numbers indicate a decrease in quantity, it means that 90 fewer lintuer remained in Finland compared to before they flew away.;
"Response:  We know that there are currently 87 lintuerperts living near the mountain and they will migrate to warmer areas during summer. If 18 new lintuerperts join them, then the total number of lintuerperts living near the mountain after their arrival is:

$ Number of lintuerperts = 87 + 18 $
= $ 105 $
Therefore, there are $ 105 $ lintuerperts living near the mountain after the new birds arrive.";
Response:  We know that 59 lintuerperts flew away during winter and 24 new ones came to live near the mountain in the Arctic region. So, the number of lintuerperts left at the mountain was 49 - (59 + 24) = 15. Therefore, there were 15 lintuerperts left at the mountain.;
"Response:  We know that 27 birds flew away to warmer climates during winter and there were originally 41 birds near the mountain. So, the number of birds left behind is:

Number of birds left = Original number of birds - Number of birds that flew away
= 41 - 27
= 14

Therefore, 14 lintuer remained near the mountain after the migration.";
"Response:  We know that 86 birds flew away from the mountain during winter and there were originally 45 birds living on the mountain. So, we can write an equation:

Number of birds left = Number of birds original + Number of birds fled

Now, let's solve for the number of birds that fled:

Number of birds fled = Total number of birds - Number of birds original
= 86 - 45
= 41

Therefore, 41 birds flew away from the mountain during winter.";
"Response:  We know that there are 41 bird families near the mountain and 35 of them flew to Asia. So, we have:

Number of birds in Asia = Number of bird families in Asia x Total number of birds in Asia (from the problem)
= 35 x?

We also know that 62 bird families flew to Africa from the mountain. So, we have:

Number of birds in Africa = Number of bird families in Africa x Total number of birds in Africa (from the problem)
= 62 x?

Now, we want to find out how many more birds flew to Africa than to Asia. To do this, we can subtract the number of birds in Asia from the number of birds in Africa:

Difference between number of birds in Africa and number of birds in Asia = Number of birds in Africa - Number of birds in Asia
=? - 35

So, there were 27 more birds that flew to Africa than to Asia.";
"Response: 
1) The three original birds stay in the mountain area.
2) 26 new birds come from the north and join them.
3) Two of these birds fly south for winter.
4) How many birds are left in the mountain area after all this movement?
Solution:
Let X be the number of original birds (3).
New birds coming from the north = 26.
Total birds in the mountain area = X + 26.
After two birds fly south = Total birds in the mountain area - 2.
So, there are X birds left in the mountain area.
X = 3.
Therefore, there were 3 birds left in the mountain area after all the movement.";
Response:  We know that Paul gave away or lost 70 books during his school year. So, at first, he had 253 - 70 = 183 books left. Now, we need to find out how many books he still has until the end of the school year. Since there are 9 months left in the school year (January to September), and Paul gives away/loses 70 books every month, he will have 183 - 7 x 70 = 183 - 490 = 164 books left at the end of the school year. Therefore, Paul has 164 books left at the end of the school year.;
Response:  We know that Paul gave away or lost 374 books during his school year (551 - 177 = 374). Therefore, he received $374$ color pencils as birthday gifts.;
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 111 pencils to his friends and kept 106 for himself. So, he had 106 - 111 = -75 pencils left. Since we can't have negative number of pencils, there must be 75 pencils left with him.;
"Response:  If Paul gave away 213 roses during his school year and he lost 16 roses, then the number of roses he had at the end of the year is:

213 - 16 = 207

So, there were 207 roses left with Paul after he gave away 213 roses and lost 16 roses.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paul gave away 589 colorful pens as birthday gifts. He distributed 571 of them among his friends and kept 16 for himself. Therefore, he gave away 571 - 16 = 555 colorful pens to his friends.;
Response:  If Paul gave away 90 roses to his friends and lost 412 roses himself, then he must have had more than 412 - 90 = 322 roses left after giving them away. Therefore, he lost 322 roses more than he gave to his friends.;
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 ruisku and lost 558, then he has 332 remaining. So, he received 332 as his birthday gift.;
Response:  If Paul gave away 52 roses and had 492 left initially, then he has 492 - 52 = 440 roses left after giving them away. So, 535 - 440 = 95 roses were given away or lost.;
"Response:  We know that Paul had 521 colored pencils and 66 erasers at the beginning of the school year. He used some of them during the year (he didn't mention how many) and at the end of the year he was left with 154 pencils and 66 erasers. So, we can calculate the number of missing or given away erasers as follows:

Number of erasers given away = Number of erasers at the end of the year - Number of erasers at the beginning of the year
= 66 - 66
= 0

So, none of the erasers were given away. Now let's count the number of missing pencils:

Number of missing pencils = Number of pencils at the end of the year - Number of pencils at the beginning of the year
= 154 - 521
= -367

Therefore, 367 colored pencils are missing or have been given away.";
Response:  We know that Paul had 531 colored pencils and 38 erasers at first. Then he used some of them to make gifts for his classmates, so he had fewer left. Specifically, we are told that he had 391 colored pencils and 38 erasers left after giving away some. Therefore, the number of red roses Paul had left is 391 - 38 = 353.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 601 coloring books and 406 crayons as birthday gifts. At the end of the school year, he had only 336 crayons left, even though he hadn't lost any. Therefore, we can conclude that Paul had 265 crayons (601 - 336) left at the end of the school year.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 315 kyn√§vyy in total and he gave or lost some of them during the school year. So, at the end of the school year, he had 291 kyn√§vyy left. Now, we need to find out how many red pencils he got as a birthday gift. The question states that he received 29 red pencils, so the answer is 29.;
"Response:  We know that Paul gave away 308 kernels of corn to his friends. Since he had 231 kernels left after giving some away, we can calculate how many kernels he gave away by subtracting the number he had left from the total number he gave away:

308 - 231 = 77

So, Paul gave away 77 kernels of corn to his friends.";
Response:  We know that Paul received 457 towels and 320 colored pens as his birthday gift. At the end of the school year, he had only 523 items left, which means he didn't lose any. Therefore, we can conclude that he still has 457 towels and 320 colored pens. So, the number of remaining ruusukyn√§ (red pens) is 457 + 320 = 777.;
Response:  The tarjoilija had 11 customers initially and some of them left. So, he had fewer customers than before. Now, we need to find out how many customers are left. We know that there were 3 customers remaining after some of the initial 11 customers left. Therefore, the number of customers who remained is 3.;
Response:  The tarjoilija had three customers initially and some of them left, leaving him with four customers remaining. So, the number of customers that remained is 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, one customer remained at the end.;
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers. Then, 9 + 3 = 12 customers left. So, initially, he had 9 customers.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 14 customers and now 5 are left. So, we can say that the number of customers Tarjeili has is equal to 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, he has 9 customers remaining.;
Response:  The initial number of customers was 13 and some left, leaving 4 new customers. So, the total number of customers after this is: 13 - 4 = 9. Therefore, 5 customers remained.;
Response:  The initial number of customers was 12 and then 15 more customers arrived, so the total number of customers became 12 + 15 = 27. Now, 14 new customers came to the restaurant, so the current number of customers is 27 - 14 = 13. Therefore, there are still 13 customers in the restaurant.;
Response:  The initial number of customers was 3 and then some more came (4). So, the total number of new customers that came is 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, there were 1 new customer who came to the restaurant.;
Response:  The initial number of customers was 8 and some left, leaving 5 remaining customers. Then, he received 99 new customers. So, the total number of customers after receiving the new customers is: 5 + 99 = 104. Therefore, 3 asiaskastayed behind.;
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers and some of them left, leaving him with 14 customers. Then he got 10 new customers. So, in total, he has 14 + 10 = 24 customers now.;
Response:  At first, Danilla had $3 - $2 = $1 left after buying the candy bar with $2. So, she had $1 initially.;
"Response:  We know that Danilla had $4 initially and spent some of it to buy a chocolate bar. So, he had $3 left after buying the chocolate bar. Now we want to find out how much the chocolate bar cost. Let's use the information given in the question: ""H√§nell√§ oli kolme dollaria j√§ljell√§, kun h√§n osti suklaapatukan."" This means that Danilla had $3 left after buying the chocolate bar. Therefore, the cost of the chocolate bar is equal to the amount of money Danilla had left after buying it, which is $3. So, the answer is $3.";
Response:  Danilla paid $4 for each suklaapatukka, so she spent in total $396 (4 x 99) dollars. Now we know that she has $4 - $396 = $-352 left. So there is $352 left over after buying the 99 suklaapatukkaa.;
Response:  If Danilla paid $3 for one suklaapatukka and he bought two suklaapatukka with $4, then we can say that each suklaapatukka cost him $\frac{3}{2} = \$1.50$. So, each suklaapatukka costs $\$1.50$.;
Response:  If he paid $3 for each suklaapatukka and bought 2 suklaapatukka, then how many did he buy in total? So, the answer is 4 (2 x $3 = $6).;
Response:  Danilla spent $2 for the chocolate bar and $3 for the ice cream, so she has $1 left over. Therefore, there is $1 remaining.;
Response:  Danilla spent $7 on candy and $6 on chocolate, so in total she spent $13 ($7 + $6).;
Response:  The total amount of money spent for chocolate is $6 + $3 = $9. So, she spent more money on chocolate than on caramel. Therefore, the answer is $9.;
Response:  Danilla spent $2 on candy and $3 on ice cream, so she spent a total of $5.;
Response:  Danilla had $4 and bought a candy bar for $8. So, she has $4 - $8 = $-4 left.;
Response:  At first, Danilla had $4. Then she spent $3 on the candy. So now she has $1 left ($4 - $3). Therefore, the candy cost $3.;
Response:  Danilla spent $3 for 10 chocolate bars, so he spent in total $3 x 10 = $30. Now, he has $4 left, because he started with $4 and spent $30. So, there is $4 left.;
Response:  We know that Danilla had $3 and he bought two chocolate bars with it. Since each bar costs the same amount of money, we can say that one chocolate bar cost $\frac{2}{3}$ of the initial amount of money Danilla had. So, the price of one chocolate bar is $\$ \frac{2}{3}$. Now, we need to find out how much each chocolate bar costs. Therefore, we multiply the price of one chocolate bar by the number of chocolate bars Danilla bought: $\$ \frac{2}{3} \times 2 = \$1$. So, each chocolate bar costs $\$1$.;
Response:  She spent $3 for candy and $7 for chocolate. So she spent in total $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, she used more money for chocolate than for candy.;
Response:  Danilla spent $7 on candy and $2 on cookies. So she spent a total of $9 (7 + 2). Therefore, she spent more money on candy than on cookies.;
Response:  We know that Paulilla is left with 37 books after selling 78 books at the auto trade show. Therefore, he has 37 books remaining.;
"Response:  We know that Paulilla had sold 137 cars and he has 105 left to sell. So, initially, he must have had x books. Since he sold 137 cars, we can write an equation as follows:
x - 137 = 105
Now solve for 'x'.
Solution: To solve this equation, we need to isolate 'x' from all other variables. In this case, we can do it by subtracting 137 from both sides of the equation:
x - 137 = 105
Subtracting 137 from both sides gives us:
x = 22
So, initially, Paulilla had 22 books.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Paulilla were initially 108 books. He sold some of them in an auto trade and gave away 35 books to his friend. After these transactions, he had 62 books left. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold in auto trade + Number of books given away

Now, let's solve for the number of books that Paul sold in the auto trade:

Number of books sold in auto trade = Total number of books - Number of books left after giving away
= 108 - 62
= 46

So, Paul sold 46 books in the auto trade.";
"Response:  We know that Paulilla was left with 151 books after buying some cars from the sale. So initially he had 50 books and bought x cars. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

50 + x = 151... (1)

Now, we are asked to find out how many books Paul bought. To do this, we need to solve for 'x' in equation (1). Can you do it now?";
Response:  We know that Paulilla are two books and he bought some cars from a car dealership. He sold 150 new cars at the dealership. If he had 58 books initially, then he must have sold x books. So, we can write an equation as follows: 2 + x = 150. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 148. Therefore, Paul sold 148 books.;
Response:  If Paulilla were to have sold more books than he bought, then the number of books he sold must be greater than the number of books he bought minus the number of books he already had (15). So, if he bought x books and already had y books, then the number of books he sold is x - y.;
"Response:  We know that Paulilla are 71 books initially and he sold some of them to buy a new car. After selling, he had 38 new books. So, the total number of books he has is:

Total no. of books = Initially there were 71 books + Books bought after selling (38)
= 71 + 38
= 109

So, he bought more books than he sold.";
"Response:  We know that Paulilla were 108 books and 55 pens. If he sold them for 66 books and 59 pens, then we can calculate how many books he had initially.

Initial number of books = Total number of books - Number of books sold
= 108 - 66
= 42

So, Paul had 42 books in his initial stock.";
"Response: 
Paul had 51 books and 106 pens. If he sold them for $82 each, then he made $82 x 51 = $4132 in total from selling books. And if he sold 106 pens at $14 each, then he made $106 x $14 = $1476 in total from selling pens. So, the total amount of money Paul made from both book and pen sales is $4132 + $1476 = $5608.
Now, let's find out how many pens Paul sold in the car wash. We know that he sold a total of $5608 worth of items, so if we divide this amount by the price of one pen ($14), we get the number of pens he sold: $5608 / $14 = 400 pens. Therefore, Paul sold 400 pens in the car wash.";
Response:  If Paul had initially 27 books and he sold some of them, then he has fewer books now than he did at first. So, if we divide the number of books he had after selling (x) by the initial number of books (27), we get x/27 = 136. Solving for x, we find that x = 109. Therefore, Paul sold 109 books.;
Response:  We know that Paulilla were initially 134 books and he gave away 39 books to his friend. So, now he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. He sold some books at an auction and had 68 books left. Therefore, he sold x books at the auto market. Since we are given that he sold some books at the auto market, we can conclude that x is not equal to zero. So, the answer is x = 68 - 39 = 29 books.;
Response:  We know that Paulilla are 95 books and 153 pens. If he sells them for $13 per book and $23 per pen, then he will get $13 x 95 = $1265 from the books and $23 x 153 = $3401 from the pens. So in total, Paul made $1265 + $3401 = $4666. Therefore, Paul sold 4666 - 13 = 4653 books in the auto parts store.;
"Response: 
Paul had 42 books and 143 pens. If he sold them for 113 books and 19 pens, then we can calculate how many pens he sold as follows:
Number of pens sold = Number of pens he had - Number of pens he got
= 143 - 19
= 124
So, Paul sold 124 pens in the auto parts store.";
Response:  Jessica had 8 roses in her garden and put them in a vase. So, initially there were 8 + 2 (the initial 10) = 10 roses in the vase.;
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the garden. Then Jessica cut 10 of them and put them into vases. So, now there are 10 + 16 = 26 roses in total (including both those in the garden and those in the vases). Therefore, there were initially 16 roses in the garden.;
"Response: 
Jessica removed 4 roses from the garden and cut more roses in her garden. So, initially there were 20 roses (23 - 4 = 20). Now, she removed some more roses, so the number of roses left is 16 (20 -? = 16). Therefore, Jessica removed 4 roses.";
Response:  If Jessica threw away 33 roses and there were initially 15 roses in Vasili's garden, then after she threw them away, there would be 15 + 33 = 48 roses left in the garden. Now, if Vasili has 17 roses now, that means Jessica must have taken away more than 48 - 17 = 31 roses from the garden. So, the answer is 31.;
Response:  If Jessica threw away 34 roses and cut more than she threw away from her garden, then there are now 15 roses in the garden instead of 21. So, if we subtract the number of roses that she threw away (34) from the total number of roses before she started (21), we get 8. Therefore, Jessica threw away more roses than she cut from her garden.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses in Vasilisa's garden and she cut additional 13 roses from it. So, the total number of roses in her garden after cutting is 7 + 13 = 20. Therefore, Jessica cut 20 - 7 = 13 roses from her garden.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses in Vasilisa's garden and then Jessica added more roses to it, bringing the total number of roses to 21. So, we can deduce that there are now 8 roses left in the garden (21 - 13 = 8).;
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. If we add the number of roses she cut from her own garden (which is not specified), then the total number of roses would be more than 15. Therefore, the number of roses Vasilisa cut must be less than or equal to 15 - x, where x is the number of roses she had before cutting any from her own garden. Similarly, if we subtract the number of orchids she cut from her own garden (also not specified) from the total number of orchids, we get the number of orchids remaining in her garden, which is greater than or equal to 62 - y, where y is the number of orchids she had before cutting any from her own garden. Now, let's substitute these values into the equation for the total number of roses: Total Number of Roses = Initial Number of Roses + Number of Roses Cut from Her Own Garden - Number of Orchids Cut from Her Own Garden Substituting the given values, we get: Total Number of Roses = 15 + x - y = 17 Since x and y are both non-negative integers, we can conclude that x = 3 and y = 4, so the number of roses Vasilisa cut was 3 and the number of orchids she cut was 4. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her own garden. So, after Jessica's action, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of orchids (2) from the new total number of orchids (21): 21 - 2 = 19. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her own garden. So, we have:
Roses: 5 + x = 12 (where x is the number of additional roses)
Orchids: 3 + y = 2 (where y is the number of additional orchids)
Now, we need to find out what values of x and y will satisfy the equation. Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
So, there are 7 additional roses in Vasilisa's garden now. And solving for y, we get:
y = 1
So, there is one additional orchid in Vasilisa's garden now. Therefore, there are 12 roses and 2 orchids in Vasilisa's garden now.";
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her own garden to add to Vasilisa's garden. So, now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. To find out how many more orchids than roses there are now, we can subtract the number of roses from the total number of plants: 20 - 11 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 more orchids than roses in Vasilisa's garden now.;
Response:  If there were initially three roses in the vase and now there are 19, then we can deduce that Jessica has added 16 more roses to the vase (19 - 3 = 16). So, she must have leaked 16 roses from her garden.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. When Jessica cut more roses from her garden, there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, we can say that Jessica cut 14 - 13 = 1 rose from her garden to add to the vase. Therefore, she cut one rose.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids in the garden. Then Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Roses before = 16
Orchids before = 3
New roses =? (from Jessica)
New orchids =? (from Jessica)

Now, let's solve for the new number of orchids:

New orchids = Old orchids + New orchids = 3 + x
Where x is the number of orchids Jessica cut from her garden.
Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:

New orchids = 3 + 7 = 10
So, Jessica cut 7 orchids from her garden.

Similarly, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can use the same approach:

New roses = Old roses + New roses = 16 + x
Where x is the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden.
Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:

New roses = 16 + 7 = 23
So, Jessica cut 7 roses from her garden.";
Response:  We know that there were initially six roses and twenty orchids in Vasilisa's garden. After Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her own garden, there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in Vasilisa's garden. So, we can conclude that there are 5 more roses than orchids in Vasilisa's garden now. Therefore, the number of roses is 22 - 5 = 17 more than the number of orchids.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in Vasilisa's garden. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her own garden. So, now there are 13 orchids and 3 roses in Vasilisa's garden. Therefore, the number of orchids plus roses is equal to 13 + 3 = 16.;
Response:  If Robinilla had 17 tuumes of hair and cut off some of them, then she has less than 17 tuumes now. We know that she cut off some of her hair because she said she cut it by half. So if she had 17 tuumes before and cut it in half, she would have 8.5 tuumes after cutting (since you can't cut something exactly in half). Now we are told that her new length is 13 tuumes, which means that she must have cut off 4.5 tuumes of hair (8.5 - 13 = 4.5). Therefore, Robinilla cut off 4.5 tuumes of hair from her original 17 tuumes.;
"Response:  If Robin had 20 cm of hair and now she has 15 cm, we can calculate how long her hair was before she cut it as follows:

New length = 15 cm
Original length = 20 cm

So, Robin's hair was 5 cm (or 2 inches) longer before she cut it.";
Response:  Firstly, Robinilla had 45 cm long hair and he cut off 35 cm of it. So now he has 10 cm (or 4 inches) of hair left. Then, his hair grew another 12 tummas (which is equal to 12 x 2.5 = 30 cm). Therefore, Robinilla's hair length now is 4 + 30 = 34 cm or 13 inches.;
Response:  If Robinilla had 19 tuumaa (or 19 cm) of hair when she was younger and now she has grown another 18 tuumaa (or 18 cm), then her total length of hair is now 37 tuumaa (or 37 cm).;
"Response:  If Robin had originally 15 cm long hair and she cut off 13 cm of it, then her new length is:
New length = Original length - Cut off length
= 15 cm - 13 cm
= 2 cm
Therefore, Robin's hair is now 2 cm long.";
Response:  The length of Robinilla's hair was initially 45 cm (sentts). Then it grew to be 8 tuumaa (tall), which is equal to 8 x 10 = 80 cm. Finally, he cut off 20 tuumaa, which is equal to 20 x 10 = 200 cm. So now his hair is 80 + (-20) = 60 cm long.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 bottles in his collection and he found 53 corks in the park. So, we can say that Danny had 12 - 53 = 41 bottles before finding those corks. Now, after finding those corks, he has 41 + 53 = 94 bottles. Therefore, Danny has 94 bottles now.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he found more bottle caps in the park. So, let's say he found x bottle caps in the park. Since we know that Danny has 53 bottles in total, the sum of the number of bottle caps he already had and the number of bottle caps he found in the park is equal to 53. Therefore, we can write the equation: 21 + x = 53. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 21 from both sides of the equation: x = 32. So, Danny found 32 bottle caps in the park.;
Response:  At first, Danny had 63 pullonkerki (pullonkorkki in Finnish). Then, he threw away 51 old ones, leaving him with 12 new ones (33 - 51 = 0). So, at first, Danny had 63 pullonkorkki.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 corks from the park and threw away 35 old ones. So, now he has 22 corks in his collection. To find out how many corks Danny found in the park, we can divide the number of corks he currently has (22) by the number of corks he threw away (35). This gives us: 22 / 35 = 0.63 or approximately 63%. Therefore, Danny found 63% of the total 36 corks in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 pullon korkeita and threw away 63 old ones. So, now he has 42 pullon korkki in his collection. To find out how many pullonkorkki Danny threw away, we can subtract the number of new ones (42) from the total number of pullons he had before throwing any away (63). Therefore, Danny threw away 63 - 42 = 21 pullonkorkki.;
"Response: 
Danny found 22 pulls and 8 packages in the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 items initially. Then he collected additional 28 pulls and 63 packages from the park, so his final collection is 30 + 28 + 63 = 114 items. Therefore, Danny had 114 pulls and 63 packages initially.";
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 pullonkorkki and 30 packaging from the park. Now he has 17 pullonkorkki and 57 packaging in his collection. So initially, Danny had 22 + 30 = 52 items.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 pullonkorkki and 14 packaging from the park. Now he has 7 pullonkorkki and 86 packages in his collection. So we can calculate how many pullonkorkki Danny found as follows: Number of pullonkorkki = Total number of pullonkorkki + Number of pullonkorkki in his collection - Number of pullonkorkki he already had. In this case, the total number of pullonkorkki is 30 (found from the park) plus 7 (already had). Therefore, the number of pullonkorkki Danny found is 30 - 7 = 23.;
Response:  According to the question, Danny found 11 pullonkorkeita and 28 packetsof pulls from the park. Now he has 68 pulls and 51 packets in his collection. To find out how many more packets than pulls Danny found, we need to subtract the number of pulls from the number of packets: 51 (packets) - 11 (pulls) = 40. So, Danny found 40 more packets than pulls in the park.;
"Response:  We know that Danny found 71 bottle caps and 24 packages in the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 packages. So, we can write an equation:

Number of bottle caps = 71
Number of packages = 24

Now let's find out how many more bottle caps Danny has than packages:

Number of bottle caps - Number of packages = 28 - 16 = 12

So, Danny has 12 more bottle caps than packages.";
Response:  We know that Danny found 10 pullorkorkki and 62 packaging in the park. Now he has 27 more pullorkorkki and 43 more packaging than before. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of pullorkorkki = 27 + 10 = 37 Number of packaging = 43 + 62 = 105 Therefore, Danny now has 105 packages more than pullorkorkki.;
"Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 pullorkorkki in the park and now he has 25 pullorkorkki left. So, we can calculate how many pullorkorkki Danny had initially as follows:

Initially, Danny had = Total number of pullorkorkki - Number of pullorkorkki lost
= 66 - 66
= 0

So, Danny did not have any pullorkorkki initially.";
Response:  If Danny had 25 bottle caps in his collection before and he found 3 more after searching through the park, then we can say that he found 3 + 25 = 28 bottle caps in total. Therefore, the answer is 28.;
"Response: 
Danny collected old bottles and threw away 60 of them from the park. He found 58 new ones and now has 67 bottle caps in his collection. So, how many bottles did Danny have initially?
Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

Initially, Danny had = 60 - 60 = 0 bottles (since he threw all of them away)
Now, he has = 58 + 67 = 125 bottles (including both old and new ones)
Therefore, Danny initially had 0 bottles.";
Response:  If Danny threw away six old bottles and found 50 new ones, then the total number of bottle caps in his collection is 6 + 50 = 56. So, Danny found 56 bottle caps in the park.;
Response:  If Danny threw away 54 old bottles and found 48 new ones, then he has 52 bottle caps in his collection now. So, Danny threw away 6 bottles (54 - 48 = 6).;
Response:  At first, Danny had 82 packs and 29 bottle caps in his collection. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 packages. So initially, Danny had 82 + 29 = 111 items in his collection.;
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 packs and 39 bottle caps in his collection. Then he found more items in the park and added them to his collection. After adding these new items, Danny now has 16 bottle caps and 68 packs in his collection. So initially, Danny had 66 + 39 = 105 items in his collection.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Danny found 46 packaging boxes and 50 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 packages in his collection. To find out how many bottle caps Danny found, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he already had (21) from the total number of bottle caps he found (50). So, Danny found 29 bottle caps in the park.;
"Response:  We know that Danny found 65 packages and 5 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 packages. So, we can write an equation:

Number of packages = 65
Number of bottle caps = 31

Now, let's solve for the number of packages more than bottle caps:

Number of packages > = Number of bottle caps + 9 (since Danny found 9 packages)

Solving for the inequality, we get:

Number of packages > = 31 + 9 = 40

So, Danny found more than 40 packages than bottle caps in the park.";
"Response:  We know that Danny found 58 bottle caps and 25 packages in the park. Now he has 11 packages and 12 bottle caps. So, we can calculate how many more bottle caps Danny has than packages as follows: Number of bottle caps = 12 (Danny's current bottle caps) - 11 (Danny's current packages) = 1 
So, Danny has one more bottle cap than package.";
Response:  We know that Danny found 15 pullorkorkki and 18 packaging in the park. Now he has 67 packages and 35 pullorkorkki. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = 67 + 15 = 82 Number of pullorkorkki = 35 + 18 = 53 Therefore, Danny has more than 53 packages than pullorkorkki.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer persimmons than Steven. So if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 11 persimmons. Therefore, the number of persimmons Steven has is 28 (x + 11).;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 14 persimmons. Since Steven has more persimmons than Jake, we can say that Jake has less than or equal to x persimmons. Therefore, Jake has exactly 7 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven, and Steven has more persimmons than Jill. So, if we start with Jake, he has 18 - 1 = 17 persimmons. Now let's move to Steven, who has 19 + 13 = 32 persimmons. Finally, let's consider Jill, who has x persimmons. Since Steven has more persimmons than Jill, Jill must have less than 32 persimmons. Therefore, Jill has exactly 30 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven, and Steven has more persimmons than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x persimmons, then Steven must have x + 8 persimmons. Since Jill has 5 persimmons, Jake must have at least 3 more persimmons than Jill, so Jake has 3x + 5 = 10 persimmons. Therefore, Jake has 10 persimmons more than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x persimmons, then Steven must have x + 4 persimmons. Now, we can see that Jill has more persimmons than both of them, so she must have at least x + 4 - 10 = 3 persimmons. Therefore, Jill has 3 more persimmons than Jake.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x persimmons, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:
x = 7 - 2 + 9 =?
Solving for x, we get:
x = 10
So, Jake has 10 persimmons.";
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than seven pears and more than six pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has 7 - x pears. Also, we know that Jill has more than eight pears than Jake, so Jill has x + 8 pears. Now, let's substitute these values in the equation: 
x + (7 - x) = 17... (1)
Now solve for x:
x = 9
So, Jill has 9 + 8 = 17 pears.";
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 9 persimmons and more than 18 persimmons than Jill. So, Jill has at least 9 persimmons. Now we know that Steven has 16 persimmons, which is more than Jill has. Therefore, Steven has at least 7 persimmons (16 - 9 = 7) more than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 15 pears (kuusi persikkaa) less than Jake. So if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 15 pears. Since Jill has 5 fewer pears than Steven, Jill has x + 15 - 5 = x + 10 pears. Therefore, Jake has 36 pears (kuusi persikkaa).;
Response:  We know that Steven has more than five pears less than Jake and he has 18 pears more than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x - 5 = 13 pears. Now we are told that Jill has 87 pears, so Jake must have x > 87. Therefore, Jake has at least 88 pears.;
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 15 persimmons than Jake and less than 16. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 15. Now we are told that Jill has 12 persimmons more than Jake, so Jill has x + 12. Since Steven has more than Jill, Steven must have x + 15 > x + 12, which simplifies to 3 = 3. Therefore, Jill has 15 persimmons more than Jake.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more olives than him. So, if we subtract 12 persimmons from Steven's total of 30 (since he has 19), then Jake must have 18 persimmons. Now, let's add 79 olives to Jake's total, which is already 18. Therefore, Jake has 96 persimmons in total.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more olives than Steven. So, if we subtract 13 apples from Steven's total of 9 apples, we get Jake's total of 6 apples (9 - 13 = 6). Now, let's add three more olives to Jake's total, so he has 6 + 3 = 9 olives in total. Therefore, Jake has 9 olives.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more olives than Steven. So, if we assume that Jake has x persimmons and y olives, then Steven must have x + 8 olives. Therefore, Steven has more persimmons than olives. Now, we are told that Steven has 17 persimmons and 16 olives, so we can set up the equation: x = 17 - 8. Solving for x, we get x = 9. Therefore, Steven has 9 persimmons more than olives.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more olives than Steven. So if we subtract three persimmons from Jake's total of 12, he will have 9 persimmons left. Now let's add ten olives to Jake's remaining nine persimmons, which gives him a total of nineteen olives. Therefore, Steven has twenty-five olives more than Jake.;
"Response:  We know that Steven has 12 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than zero. So, we can say that Jake has x persimmons. Since Jill has 67 persimmons more than Jake, we can write an equation as follows:
Jake + x = 67... (1)
We also know that Steven has 12 persimmons, so we can add this to both sides of Equation (1):
Jake + x + 12 = 67 + 12... (2)
Now, let's solve for ""x"" in Equation (2). To do this, subtract 12 from both sides of Equation (2), which gives us:
Jake + x = 55
Now, divide both sides of Equation (3) by ""Jake"":
x = 55 / 4 = 13
So, Jake has 13 persimmons.";
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 persimmons and Jake has fewer than 12. So, Jake must have at least 6 persimmons. Now we also know that Steven has more persimmons than Jake, so Jill has less than 8 persimmons. Therefore, Jill has exactly 7 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 persimmons and Jake has less than 12 persimmons. So, Jake must have at least 12 - 19 = 7 persimmons. Therefore, Jake has 7 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 persimmons and Jake has less than 14 persimmons. So, Jake must have at least 14 - 6 = 8 persimmons. Now we also know that Jill has more persimmons than Jake, so Jill has exactly 8 + 3 = 11 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 13 persimmons and 52 omelets. So, if we subtract 13 from 52, we get 39. Therefore, Jake has 39 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 8 persimmons and 12 olives. So, in total, he has 8 + 12 = 20 fruits. Now, we are told that Jake has fewer than 13 olives and more than 17 persimmons than Steven. This means that Jake has at least 20 - 13 = 7 olives and at most 17 + 17 = 34 persimmons. Therefore, Jake has exactly 7 olives and 34 persimmons.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Kahdeksan and more olives than ten. So, if we assume that Jake has x persimmons and y olives, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 18 (the number of persimmons Jake has)
x - 8 = 0 (Jake has fewer persimmons than Kahdeksan)
y = 22 (the number of olives Jake has)
Now, let's substitute these equations into each other to find out how many persimmons Steven has more than olives:
x + y = 18... (1)
x - 8 = 0... (2)
y = 22... (3)
Substituting (2) into (1), we get:
x + y = 18
x - 8 = 0
y = 22
Solving for x, we get:
x = 10
So, Steven has 10 persimmons more than olives.";
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more olives than Steven. So if we subtract three persimmons from Jake's total of 20 (which is equal to the number of olives), then Jake would have 17 persimmons left. Now let's add four olives to Jake's remaining 17 persimmons, which gives him a new total of 21 persimmons. Therefore, Steven has 19 olives and 15 persimmons more than Jake.;
Response:  The total amount of money that Oliva had was $78. She spent $15 at the supermarket, so now she has $63 left ($78 - $15). Therefore, Oliva has $63 left in her wallet.;
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and has $33 left, then she must have had $105 initially (78 + 33 = 105).;
"Response: 
Olivian lompakossa oli $100 at first. He collected $148 from an ATM. After he went to the supermarket, there was $159 left. So, how much did he spend in total?
Let X be the amount of money Olivian spent at the supermarket. We know that after he went to the supermarket, there were $159 - X dollars left in his wallet. Since we also know that Olivian had $100 initially and collected $148 from the ATM, the total amount of money he had is:
$100 + $148 = $248
So, the amount of money Olivian spent at the supermarket is:
X = $248 - $159 = $89
Therefore, Olivian spent $89 at the supermarket.";
Response:  According to the problem statement, Olivia found $3 in her wallet and withdrew $49 from an ATM. After shopping at the supermarket, she had $49 left. So, the amount of money she spent at the supermarket is $49 - $3 = $46. Therefore, Olivia collected more money from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket. The difference between these two amounts is $49 - $46 = $3.;
Response:  We know that Oliva had $53 at first and raised $91 from the ATM. So, she had $144 ($53 + $91) after buying something in the supermarket. Therefore, she spent more money than she raised at the ATM. The difference between what she spent and what she raised is $47 ($144 - $91).;
Response:  We know that $106 was spent at the supermarket and after visiting both places, there were $26 left. If he spent $49 at the exhibition hall, then the amount spent at the supermarket is: $$ Supermarket = Total - Exhibition Hall = 106 - 49 = 57 $$;
"Response:  If there were originally $54 in the wallet and now only $29 is left, then we can calculate how much was spent as follows:

$29 (amount remaining) = $54 (original amount) - $? (amount spent)

We are given that $29 is left in the wallet, so we know that the total amount spent must be equal to or greater than $29. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

$54 - x = $29

Where x represents the amount spent. Solving for x, we get:

x = $26

So, Olivia spent $26 from her original $54.";
"Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had initially $128 in her wallet, then we can calculate how much money is left as follows:

$128 (initial amount) - $38 (amount spent) = $90 (remaining amount)

Therefore, there are $90 dollars remaining in Olivia's wallet after she made the purchase at the supermarket.";
Response:  We know that Daveilla had 19 apps installed on his phone and he removed 5 of them. So, after removing those 5 apps, he has 14 apps left on his phone. Therefore, the number of apps Daveilla has on his phone is 14.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 18 applications in his phone. When he removed 18, there were 5 left. So, initially, Dave had 18 + 5 = 23 applications in his phone.;
"Response:  We know that Dave had 10 apps installed on his phone initially and then he added 11 new ones. So, the total number of apps on his phone after adding the new ones is:

10 + 11 = 21

Now, we are asked how many apps Dave removed. The answer can be found in the last part of the question: ""Poistettuani muutaman"". This means that Dave removed some apps, but not all of them. Therefore, the number of apps left on his phone after removing some is:

4 (the number of apps left on his phone) =? (the number of apps Dave removed)

Solving for the unknown value, we get:

4 = x

So, Dave removed 4 apps from his phone.";
"Response:  The initial number of apps was 21 and he added 89 new ones, so the total number of apps is:

21 + 89 = 106

So, he added 83 new apps (106 - 24).";
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 apps installed initially and he added 71 new ones. So, the total number of apps he had was 15 + 71 = 86. Now, we are asked how many apps he removed. Since some were already removed before the question, let's assume he removed 30 apps (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the final number of apps Dave had on his phone after removing 30 is 86 - 30 = 56.;
Response:  The total number of applications and files was 16 + 77 = 93. If he removed some apps and files, then the remaining number is 5 (applications) + 23 (files). So, he removed 88 (16 - 5 + 23) applications and files.;
Response:  The total number of files was 17 + 21 = 38. If he removed some applications and files, then the remaining number must be less than 38. So, he removed 38 - (number of applications and files he removed) = x. Therefore, the number of files he removed is x.;
Response:  The number of applications and files that were removed is given as 15 and 24 respectively. This means that there are 15 - 3 = 12 applications left after removing some. Similarly, there are 24 - 6 = 18 files left after removing some. Therefore, the number of applications and files that he has left is 12 + 18 = 30. So, he has 30 applications and 4 files left.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 19 applications and files on the phone. When we deleted some of them, the number of applications decreased to 6, but the number of files remained at 15. So, the answer is 15.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 apps installed on his phone and he added some more. So, let's say he added x apps. Now we have 17 + x = 18. Solving for x, we get x = 3. Therefore, Dave added 3 apps to his phone.;
Response:  The total number of files and apps was 59 + 15 = 74. After deleting some apps and files, there were 12 apps and 30 files left. So, the number of apps he deleted is 74 - 12 = 62.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 24 files and 13 applications in the phone. If we subtract the number of applications (13) from the total number of files (24), we get 11. So, the person removed 11 files.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 24 applications and 9 files in the phone. Then, some of them were deleted, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that half of the initial number (i.e., 12) were deleted. Now, we have 5 files and 12 applications left. Therefore, the person has 12 applications left in their phone.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 11 applications and 3 files in Daveilla's phone. When he removed some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, the number of files Daveilla has left is 24.;
"Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards in total and gave 136 to Jeff. So, we can calculate the number of cards Nell has left as follows:

Number of cards Nell has = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff
= 242 - 136
= 106

Therefore, Nell has 106 cards left.";
Response:  At first, Nell had 301 cards (given). Now she has 154 left (given). So, initially, Nell had 301 - 154 = 147 cards.;
"Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. Now, she has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her initial number of cards (528) and her current number of cards (252). Therefore, the answer is:

Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 528 - 252 = 276

So, Nell gave 276 cards to Jeff.";
"Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now, we are told that Nell has 535 cards left. So, the number of cards Jeff has is equal to the difference between the total number of cards and the number of cards Nell has left minus the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
Jeff's cards = Total cards - (Nell's cards left - Number of cards given to Jeff)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Jeff's cards = 566 - (535 - 234)
= 566 - 301
= 265
Therefore, Jeff has 265 cards.";
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer than 309 - the number of cards she gave away = 278 baseball cards left with her. Now, we are told that she has 415 baseball cards in total, so she must have received 415 - 278 = 137 new baseball cards from someone or somewhere. Since she already had 356 10-card packs, she now has 137 + 356 = 493 10-card packs in total. Therefore, Nell has more than 10 10-card packs, specifically 493 - 10 = 483 10-card packs.;
"Response:  We know that Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has fewer than before. So, let's call the number of baseball cards she had after giving some to Jeff as x. Then we can write the equation:

x + 214 = 404... (1)

We also know that Nell has more than 10 cards left after giving some to Jeff, so let's call the number of 10-card packs she has as y. Since each pack contains 10 cards, we can write:

y + 246 = 495... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method?";
Response:  We know that Nell gave some cards to both John and Jeff. So, she had 573 - 195 = 378 cards left after giving some to John. Then, she gave even more cards to Jeff, so now she has 378 - x = 210 cards left. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff x = 168 cards.;
"Response:  We know that Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has fewer than before. Specifically, we are told that she had 438 baseball cards and 18 10-card sets, which means she had a total of 466 cards (438 + 18). After giving some to Jeff, she has 55 10-card sets and 178 baseball cards left. So, the number of 10-card sets Nell has more than 10 is:

55 - 10 = 45

Therefore, Nell has 45 more 10-card sets than 10.";
"Response:  We know that Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has fewer cards than before. Specifically, she has 376 10-card packs and 111 baseball card packs left. So, if we subtract the number of 10-card packs from the total number of cards she had (239), we get:

239 - 376 = -137

Now, let's check how many more 10-card packs Nell has than baseball card packs:

111 - (-137) = 158

So, Nell has 158 more 10-card packs than baseball card packs. In other words, for every 10-card pack she has, she has 158 more baseball card packs.";
Response:  If Paco had 19 cookies and gave away 6, then he had 19 - 6 = 13 cookies left. So, at the beginning, Paco had 35 - 13 = 22 cookies.;
Response:  If Paco had eaten 28 cookies and he has 7 left, then he must have eaten 21 cookies initially. So, the number of cookies that Paco ate is 21.;
"Response: 
Paco started with 40 loaves of bread and ate two. So he had 40 - 2 = 38 left. Then he bought 37 more loaves, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 loaves of bread left.";
Response:  First, Paco ate 25 cookies. Then he ate 5 more. So, in total, he ate 30 cookies. Later, he bought 3 additional cookies. Therefore, the final number of cookies that Paco ate is 30 + 3 = 33.;
"Response: 
Paco s√∂i 13 loaves of bread. This means he ate 2 (since each loaf is 6). So far, he has eaten 2 + 2 = 4 loaves of bread.
Then, he bought 36 more loaves of bread. So, in total, he now has 4 + 36 = 40 loaves of bread.
Therefore, he bought more bread than he ate.";
"Response: 
Paco had 40 loaves of bread to share among his friends. He gave 5 loaves to each of 3 friends, so he had 40 - (5 x 3) = 20 loaves left.";
Response:  Paco ate 17 loaves of bread and gave 13 to his friends. So he had 14 left over after giving some away. Therefore, he ate more than his friends did. The difference is 14 - 13 = 1.;
Response:  Paco ate 12 loaves of bread and gave away 21 to his friends. So he had 21 - 12 = 9 more loaves left after giving them away.;
Response:  Paco had 22 pieces of salty crackers and he ate 15 of them. So, he has 22 - 15 = 7 pieces of salty crackers left. Now, he also had 75 pieces of sweet crackers and he ate 54 of them. So, he has 75 - 54 = 21 pieces of sweet crackers left. Therefore, Paco has 7 + 21 = 28 pieces of crackers left.;
"Response: 
Paco initially had 9 sweet and 6 salty crackers. He then ate 36 sweet and 3 salty crackers. So, he has eaten a total of 72 crackers (36 + 3). Now, we need to find out how many salty crackers were left after he finished eating.
Let's use the information given in the question:
Paco had 6 salty crackers initially.
He ate 3 salty crackers.
So, the number of salty crackers left after he finished eating is:
6 - 3 = 3
Therefore, there are 3 salty crackers left after Paco finishes eating.";
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Paco consumed 37 pieces of candy and 11 saltwater crackers. He then ate five more pieces of candy than he did saltwater crackers. Therefore, if he ate x pieces of candy, he would have eaten 5x - 11 saltwater crackers. Since we know that the total number of candies is 42 (including both types), we can set up the equation: 5x = 42 - 11. Solving for x gives us x = 21. So, Paco ate 21 pieces of candy more than he did saltwater crackers.;
Response:  According to the question, Paco first ate eight sweet and six salty cookies. Then he ate 20 more sweets and 34 more salty cookies. So in total, Paco ate 8 + 20 = 28 sweet cookies and 6 + 34 = 40 salty cookies. Therefore, Paco ate 40 salty cookies.;
Response:  At first, Paco had 37 cookies and he ate 36 of them. So, how many cookies did Paco have left after eating 36 cookies? Answer: After eating 36 cookies, Paco had 1 cookie left (37 - 36 = 1).;
Response:  Paco had 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So, he had 22 cookies left (36 - 14 = 22).;
Response:  Paco had 41 pieces of bread and gave away 9 to his friend. So he has 32 pieces left (41 - 9 = 32). He ate 18 himself, so he has 14 pieces left after eating (32 - 18 = 14). Therefore, Paco ate more than his friend because he ate 14 pieces while giving away only 9.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Paco gave 30 cookies to his friend and ate 23 of them. So, he gave more cookies than he ate. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies given and the number of cookies eaten is equal to the number of cookies that Paco gave to his friend minus the number of cookies that he ate. In other words, we can write this as follows:
Given = Cookies given to friend - Cookies eaten by Paco
= 30 - 23
= 7
So, Paco gave 7 more cookies to his friend than he ate.";
"Response:  We know that Paco consumed 97 salty crackers and 34 sweet crackers in total. He also had 15 sweet crackers left after consuming them. Therefore, the number of sweet crackers Paco had left is:

15 - (97 / 2) = 34

So, there were 34 sweet crackers left for Paco to consume.";
Response:  We know that Paco ate 26 salty crackers and 17 sweet crackers in total. He also ate 14 sweet crackers and 9 salty crackers. So, how many salty crackers did Paco have left? Well, if he had 9 salty crackers left after eating 14 sweet crackers, then he must have had 35 (26 + 17) - 9 = 26 salty crackers left initially. Therefore, there were 26 salty crackers left for Paco to eat.;
"Response:  We know that Paco consumed 39 makkara and 6 suolaista keksi√§. He ate 23 suolaista and 32 makeaa keksia. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Makkara = 39 - 6 (suolaista)
Makeaa = 32 - 23 (suolaista)

Step 1: Calculate how much money Gwen received from her mother.
$3 (given by mother) + $6 (given by father) = $9

Step 2: Calculate how much money Gwen spent.
-$4 (spent) = $5 (remaining amount)

Therefore, Gwen received $9 from her mother and father combined, and she spent $4 of it, leaving her with $5 remaining. So, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother did.";
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her mother and $7 more from her mother, then she received a total of $12 ($5 + $7) from her mother. However, if she spent $4, then she has $8 left ($12 - $4). So, the amount of money that Gwen received from her mother is $8, which is more than the amount she received from her father ($5).;
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her mother and $2 from her father, so she has a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she has $1 left with her. So, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother. The difference between the amount given by the father and the amount given by the mother is $1 ($7 - $6 = $1).;
Response:  We know that Joshin had nine gold coins initially and he lost some of them. So, if he has four gold coins left, then he must have lost five gold coins. Therefore, the answer is 5.;
Response:  If Joshin had 21 gold coins and he lost 21 of them, then he has 0 - 21 = -21 gold coins left in his collection. Since he has 12 corners, each corner can hold one gold coin. So, the number of gold coins Joshin had in his collection is equal to the number of corners he has multiplied by the number of gold coins each corner can hold. Therefore, the answer is -21 x 12 = -244 gold coins.;
Response:  At first, he had 19 gold coins and lost 11 of them, so he has 8 left (19 - 11 = 8). Then, he found 5 new coins, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 gold coins in total.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Joshin had 4 gold coins initially and lost 16 of them. So he had 4 - 16 = -12 gold coins left. Then, he found 8 new gold coins. Therefore, his final number of gold coins is -12 + 8 = 0.
So, Joshin menetti enemm√§n kuin l√∂ysi marmorit.";
Response:  If Joshin had 7 gold coins and lost 8 of them, then he has 7 - 8 = 9 gold coins left. Now, if he found 10 new gold coins, then his total number of gold coins is 9 + 10 = 19. So, he gained 19 - 7 = 12 more gold coins than he lost. Therefore, the answer to the question is 12.;
Response:  We know thatjoshi has 21 gold coins and he found 7 corners. So, there are 21 - 7 = 14 remaining coins. Therefore, joshing now has 14 gold coins.;
"Response:  We know that Joshin collection contained 20 gold coins and he gave two balls to Jack. So now, we need to find out how many corners Josh has after giving those balls to Jack. 
Let's assume the number of corners Josh had before giving the balls to Jack is x. Now, after giving the balls to Jack, Josh has x - 2 corners. Therefore, the answer is x - 2.";
"Response:  We know that Joshin initial collection contained 22 gold coins and Jack gave him 20 angles. So, we can write the equation as follows:

Joshin initial collection = 22
Jack gave Josh 20 angles
New amount of gold coins with Jack's gift =?

To find out how many gold coins Josh has now, we need to subtract the number of angles Jack gave him from his initial collection. Therefore, the answer is:

New amount of gold coins with Jack's gift = Initial collection - Number of angles given by Jack
= 22 - 20
= 2

So, Josh now has 2 gold coins more than he initially had.";
Response:  If Josh had 19 gold medals before and he won 5 more, then he has now 24 gold medals (19 + 5).;
Response:  We know that Joshin had 22 gold coins and he found 13 marbles. He lost 5 marbles. So, now he has 22 - 5 = 17 gold coins left.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Joshin had 15 gold coins and found 9 marbles. This means he gained 6 (15 - 9 = 6) marbles. However, he lost 23 marbles, which is more than the number of marbles he gained. Therefore, the answer is 23.;
Response:  We know that Joshin had three gold coins and found six marbles. He lost five marbles. So, he gained 6 - 5 = 1 more marble than he lost. Therefore, the number of marbles Joshin found is 3 + 1 = 4.;
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father's mushrooms is 4 kg. If Marco's mushrooms weigh around 20 kg, then his father's mushrooms must have weighed twice as much, or 40 kg. Therefore, Marco's mushrooms were heavier than his father's by 30 kg (or 66 pounds).;
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father's mangoes is 15 kg. If Marco's mangoes weigh about 5 kg, then his father's mangoes must have weighed more than 10 kg (15 - 5 = 10). Therefore, Marco's father's mangoes weighed 10 kg more than Marco's mangoes.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 20 kg of mushrooms, and his father's mushrooms weighed 17 kg, then Marco's mushrooms must have weighed 3 kg (20 - 17 = 3).;
"Response:  Marco's mangoes weigh about 5 kg and his father's mangoes weigh about 20 kg. So, the difference in weight between their mangoes is:

20 kg - 5 kg = 15 kg

Therefore, Marco's mangoes are heavier than his father's by 15 kg.";
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected over 10 kg of strawberries. Then, Marco reduced them to 3 kg. So, we can say that Marco's portion of the strawberries was 3/2 = 1.5 kg. Now, we need to find out how much did Marco's father have originally. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Marco's father's strawberries = Total strawberries - Marco's strawberries
= 10 kg - 1.5 kg
= 8.5 kg

Therefore, Marco's father's strawberries were 8.5 kg.";
Response:  According to the question, Marco and his father together collected over 10 kg of strawberries. Then, Marco's father reduced three kilograms of them. So, now Marco's strawberries weigh 12 kg. Therefore, Marco's father's strawberries must weigh 7 kg (10 kg - 3 kg).;
Response:  Marco and his father together collected 22 kg of mushrooms. On their way back, Marco's father found an additional 20 kg of mushrooms. So now Marco has 13 kg of mushrooms left. To find out how much his father had, we need to subtract the amount that Marco has from the total amount they collected: 22 kg - 13 kg = 9 kg. Therefore, Marco's father currently has 9 kg of mushrooms.;
"Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 20 kg of mushrooms, and Marco's mushrooms weighed 15 kg, then his father must have had x kg of mushrooms. Since they collect them together, their total weight is equal to the sum of their weights, so we can write: 
x + 15 = 20... (1)
Now we solve for x: x = 5 kg. So, Marco's father's mushrooms weigh 5 kg.";
"Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 30 kg of mushrooms, then their total weight must be equal to 17 kg (the difference between the total weight of Marco's mushrooms and the combined weight of Marco and his father). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Marco's mushrooms + His father's mushrooms = 17 kg

Now let's solve for Marco's mushrooms:

Marco's mushrooms = 17 kg - (Marco's father's mushrooms)

We are given that Marco's father's mushrooms weigh 20 kg, so we can plug this value into the equation:

Marco's mushrooms = 17 kg - 20 kg
= -3 kg

Therefore, Marco's mushrooms weighed -3 kg less than his father's mushrooms.";
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 10 kg of mangoes, then the weight of Marco's mangoes must be equal to half of that amount, which is 5 kg. So, the weight of Marco's father's mangoes must be 5 kg + x kg, where x is the difference between 5 kg and 10 kg. Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's mangoes is 5 kg + 5 kg = 10 kg.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 30 kg of mushrooms, and Marco's father's mushrooms weighed about 5 kg, then Marco must have had how many mushrooms? We can calculate this as follows: Total weight = 30 kg / 2 = 15 kg (Marco's share) x Number of mushrooms = 15 kg / 5 kg (per bag) = 3 bags So, Marco had 3 bags of mushrooms that weighed 3 x 5 kg = 15 kg in total.;
Response:  Before boarding the bus, there were 5 children (Bussi oli t√§ynn√§ lapsia). Now, after some children have gotten off the bus and new ones have boarded, there are 10 children in total (Bussissa oli yhteens√§ 10 lasta). Therefore, there are now more children in the bus than before (Montako lasta on bussissa nyt enemm√§n kuin ennen bussipys√§kki√§). The correct answer is 5.;
Response:  We know that there are 26 people in the office and 38 people boarded the bus. So, we need to find out how many people are left behind. Therefore, the number of people who did not board the bus is equal to the total number of people minus those who boarded the bus. In this case, it means that 26 - 38 = 9 people remained in the office. Thus, there are 9 people remaining in the office.;
Response:  The number of children who boarded the bus is given as 2. So, initially there were 41 - 2 = 39 children in the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus at the bus stop, so now there are 39 + 2 = 41 children in the bus. Therefore, the correct answer is 41.;
Response:  The bus was full of 43 passengers. Then, 21 passengers got off at the bus stop. So, the number of passengers left in the bus is: 43 - 21 = 22.;
Response:  The initial number of children was 41 and they got off at some bus stop. Then there were 18 children left in the bus. So, initially, there were 41 - 18 = 23 children in the bus before the bus stop.;
"Response:  We know that 10 students got off the bus and some others boarded it. So, there are fewer students in the bus now than before. Let's assume that the number of students who boarded the bus is x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of students in the bus = Number of students who got off the bus + Number of students who boarded the bus
= 10 + x

Since there were 21 students initially, we can set up another equation:

Number of students in the bus = 21

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and x). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 4

So, 4 students boarded the bus at the bus stop.";
"Response:  We know that there were 63 children getting off the bus and 14 children boarding the bus. So, the difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of children who were already on the bus when it arrived at the stop. Therefore, we can write:

Number of children getting off the bus = Number of children boarding the bus + Number of children already on the bus

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

63 - 14 = x

Solving for x, we find that there were 49 children already on the bus when it arrived at the stop.";
Response:  We know that there were initially 36 luggage pieces and then 68 passengers boarded the bus, which means that some of them had to leave their luggage behind. Moreover, some passengers got on the bus. Therefore, we can deduce that the number of luggage pieces left in the bus is equal to the difference between the initial amount (36) and the total number of passengers who boarded the bus minus those who got off (12). So, the answer is 24.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 more boarded the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus at this point was 62 (22 + 40). Then, 2 children got off the bus at the stop. Therefore, the number of children left in the bus after they got off is 62 - 2 = 60.;
Response:  The initial number of passengers was 28 and then 82 more boarded the bus. So, the total number of passengers at that point was 108 (28 + 82). Then, some passengers got off the bus, leaving 30 passengers remaining in the bus. Therefore, the number of passengers who boarded the bus is 82 - 30 = 52.;
Response:  We know that there were 23 children at first and then 4 more got on the bus when some others got off. So, in total, there are 8 children left on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 15 (23 - 8).;
Response:  If Leipuri sold 133 cakes and bought 51, then he must have had more than 51 cakes at first. So, if Baker made more cakes than Leopuris, then Baker must have made at least 82 cakes (133 - 51 = 82).;
Response:  If he sold some of his 54 cookies and has 13 left, then we can calculate how many he had initially. So, if he sold some of his initial 54 cookies, that means he has less than 54 now. Let's assume he had x cookies initially. Then, after selling some, he has x - 13 cookies left. Now, let's find out how many cookies he sold. Since he sold some, he must have sold at least one cookie, since he doesn't have any left. Therefore, the number of cookies he sold is at least 1. So, the total number of cookies he sold is x - 1 = 53.;
Response:  If he sold 145 kebabs and has 72 left, that means he made a total of 217 kebabs (145 + 72).;
Response:  If he sold 155 cakes and his friends bought 140 from him, then he has 15 - 14 = 1 more cake left. So there is one more cake to be baked.;
Response:  The person bought 170 new bread rolls and sold 105 of them. So, they have 65 bread rolls left (170 - 105 = 65).;
"Response:

He sold 91 houses and bought 154 new ones.
So, he bought more than he sold.
Therefore, Baker bought 63 more houses than he sold.";
"Response: 
Leipuri teki 170 kakkua (sold 170 bread).
He sold 78 and bought 31 new loaves of bread.
So he has 49 less bread than he originally had.
Therefore, Baker sold more bread than what he purchased.
The difference between the number of bread he sold and the number he purchased is 49.
So, Baker sold 49 - 49 = 0 bread more than what he purchased.";
"Response:  First, he made 110 cakes and sold 75 of them. Then, he made additional 76 cakes. So, the total number of cakes he has made is:

110 - 75 = 35 (cakes he already sold) + 76 = 111 (new cakes he made)

Therefore, there are 111 cakes in total that he has made and still has.";
"Response: 
Leipuri teki 144 kakkua ensin ja myi 71 kappaletta siit√§. T√§m√§ tarkoittaa sitten, ett√§ h√§nell√§ oli j√§ljell√§ 73 kakkua (144 - 71 = 73).

"Response:  If he sold 10 cakes and 90 muffins, then the number of remaining cakes is:

Leipuri teki = 149 cakes + 91 muffins - 10 cakes - 90 muffins = 62 cakes

So there are 62 cakes left.";
Response:  If he sold 15 cakes and 103 lemonades, then we know that he had 148 - 15 = 133 lemonades left initially. Therefore, there are still 133 lemonades left.;
"Response:  The baker made 126 cakes and 48 bread rolls in total. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 bread rolls, then we can calculate how many more cakes than bread rolls the baker made as follows:

Cakes (made) = Total cakes x Sold cakes / Total cakes
= 126 x 115 / 126
= 139

So, the baker made 139 more cakes than bread rolls.";
"Response:  The baker made 19 cakes and 131 bread rolls in total. If he sold 70 cakes and 88 bread rolls, then we can calculate how many more bread rolls the baker made initially as follows:

Number of bread rolls initially = Total number of bread rolls x Percentage sold / 100
= 131 x (70/131) / 100
= 131 x 56 / 100
= 742

So, the baker initially made 742 bread rolls.";
Response:  If he sold 157 cakes and 169 pastries, then together they add up to 326 items. If he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries, then together they add up to 305 items. So, there are 21 more cakes than pastries (326-305=21). Therefore, the baker sold 21 more cakes than lemonades.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, the baker sold 54 cakes and 143 bread rolls initially. If he then sold 68 cakes and 92 bread rolls more, we can calculate how many bread rolls he sold more than cakes as follows: Number of bread rolls sold more = Total number of bread rolls sold (143) - Number of cakes sold (68) = 143 - 68 = 75 So, the baker sold 75 more bread rolls than cakes.;
Response:  If he had made 48 cakes initially, there would be 0 cakes left after he made 44 of them. So, there are 4 - 44 = 36 cakes left.;
Response:  If he had made 40 cakes at first and then sold 8 of them, that means he has 40 - 8 = 32 cakes left. So, if he sells 8 more cakes, he will have 32 - 8 = 24 cakes left. Therefore, he sold 8 + 8 = 16 cakes in total.;
Response:  If his friend bought 137 chocolates and he had initially 169 chocolates, then there are 32 chocolates left (169 - 137 = 32).;
Response:  Firstly, he bought 103 new bread rolls and sold 86 of them, so he has 173 - 86 = 87 bread rolls left.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Baker bought 167 new bread rolls and sold 89 of them. So he has 78 remaining bread rolls that he did not sell (167 - 89 = 78). Now we need to find out how many more bread rolls Baker bought than he sold. To do this, we can subtract the number of bread rolls he sold from the total number of bread rolls he bought: 78 - 89 = -11. Therefore, Baker bought 11 more bread rolls than he sold.;
"Response: 
Leipuri teki kahdeksan kakkua (8 cakes).
He bought 139 new cakes and sold 145.
So he bought more than he sold.
Therefore, Baker sold 6 more cakes than he bought.
In numerical terms, Baker sold 145 - 139 = 6 more cakes than he bought.";
Response:  First, he made 62 cakes and then he added 149 more to make a total of 211 cakes. He sold 144 cakes, so there are still 7 cakes left (211 - 144 = 7).;
"Response: 
Leipuri teki ensin 81 kakkua, then he made additional 92 kakkua. So in total, he made 173 kakkua (81 + 92).
Now, he sold 46 kakkua. So, the number of kakkua that Baker had after selling is:
173 - 46 = 127
Therefore, Baker had 127 kakkua more than he sold.";
Response:  If she sold 108 kakkua and 44 leivonnaista initially, then there are 252 kakkua (108 + 144) and 61 leivonnaista left. To find out how many more kakkua can be made, we need to subtract the number of kakkua already sold from the total number of kakkua available for making: 252 - 108 = 144. So, 144 kakkua can still be made by baking.;
Response:  If he sold 104 kakkua and 29 leivonnaista, then we know that he has 56 - 104 = 38 leivonnaista left. So there are 38 leivonnaista still left.;
"Response:  The baker made 52 leivonnaista and 84 kakkua initially. If he sold 102 kakkua and 94 leivonnaista, then we can calculate how many more kakkua than leivonnaisa the baker made as follows:

New total number of kakkua = Initial total number of kakkua + Sold kakkua (102)
= 84 + 102
= 186

Now, let's find out how many more leivonnaista than kakkua the baker made:

New total number of leivonnaista = Initial total number of leivonnaista + Sold leivonnaista (94)
= 52 + 94
= 146

So, the baker made 146 more leivonnaista than kakkua.";
"Response:  The baker made 134 leivonnaista and 11 kakkua initially. If he sold 140 kakkua and 92 leivonnaista, then we can calculate how many more leivonnaista the baker made than kakkua as follows:

Number of leivonnaista made by the baker = Initial number of leivonnaista + Number of leivonnaista sold - Number of kakkua sold
= 134 + (140 - 11) - 92
= 156
Therefore, the baker made 156 leivonnaista more than kakkua.";
Response:  If he sold 8 lemonade and 97 cakes, then he had 14 cakes left initially. Now if he sells some of his remaining cakes, let's say x number of cakes, then he will have (14 - x) cakes left. Similarly, if he sells some of his remaining lemonaid, let's say y number of lemons, then he will have (97 - y) lemons left. So now we can calculate how many more cakes he has sold than lemons as follows: Number of cakes sold = Total number of cakes available for sale - Number of cakes left after selling = (14 - x) - (97 - y) = x - y Now we know that x - y is equal to the number of cakes he has sold more than lemons. Therefore, the answer is x - y.;
Response:  The girl baked 43 cakes and 114 bread rolls. If she sold 154 bread rolls and 78 cakes, then we can calculate how many more bread rolls than cakes she sold as follows: Number of bread rolls sold = 154 Number of cakes sold = 78 Now, let's subtract the number of cakes from the total number of bread rolls to find out how many more bread rolls were sold: Difference in bread rolls = Total bread rolls sold - Cakes sold = 154 - 78 = 76 So, the girl sold 76 more bread rolls than cakes.;
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she needs to have 140 games left after buying some more, then we can calculate how many games she needs to buy as follows:

Number of games Kelly already has = 22
Number of games Kelly wants to have left = 140 - 22 = 118
So, Kelly needs to buy x number of games where x = 118 / 22 = 5.33 games. Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 6 or 7 Nintendo games (depending on whether you round up or down).";
Response:  Kelly has already played 106 games, so she has 64 - 106 = 38 games left to play.;
Response:  At first, Kelly had 91 Nintendo games, so she had x games initially. Now, she has 92 games left, which means that x - 92 = 91. Solving for x, we get x = 93. Therefore, Kelly started with 93 Nintendo games.;
"Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games, that means she has a total of 90 games. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away so that she will have 12 left, we can divide 90 by 12:

90 / 12 = 7

So, Kelly needs to give away 7 Nintendo games in order to have 12 left.";
"Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and needs to give away 75 Sony games to have 31 remaining. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of Nintendo games = 46
Number of Sony games given away = 75 - Number of Sony games left after giving them away

Now, let's solve for the number of Sony games left after giving them away:

Number of Sony games left = Number of Sony games given away - (Number of Sony games left x Percentage of Sony games Kelly wants to keep)

We are told that Kelly wants to keep 31 Sony games, so we can plug in this value for percentage:

Percentage of Sony games kept = 31 / Total number of Sony games

Substituting this value into our previous equation, we get:

Number of Sony games left = 75 - (75 x 31 / 100)

Simplifying and solving for the number of Sony games left, we find that there are 24 Sony games left after Kelly gives away 75 games:

Number of Sony games left = 24

Therefore, Kelly has 31 Sony games left after giving away 75 games.";
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and she found 31 new ones, then she has 80 - 31 = 49 remaining games. To have 6 games left, we need to divide 49 by 6, which gives us 8. So, Kelly needs to give away 8 of her existing games to have 6 left.;
"Response:  If he has built 52 kortteli of the tower and there are 38 korttelia left, then we can calculate how many korttelia he had at the beginning as follows:

Randyll√§ had x korttelia at the beginning.
After building 52 kortteli of the tower, he had x - 38 korttelia left.
So, x = 90.";
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he wants to build a tower with them. If he uses all of his blocks for building the tower, then he will have none left over. So, we can say that the number of blocks he used for building the tower is equal to the total number of blocks he had minus the number of blocks left over after building the tower. In this case, if there are 72 blocks left over after building the tower, then Randy must have used 97 - 72 = 25 blocks for building the tower.;
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 cards and he builds two structures - one tower with 14 cards and another building with 11 cards. So, we need to find out how many cards are left after these constructions.

Tower construction uses 14/79 = 0.18 cards (or 18%) of Randy's total cards.
Building construction uses 11/79 = 0.14 cards (or 14%) of Randy's total cards.
So, there are 79 - 0.18 - 0.14 = 65 cards left after both constructions.";
"Response:  We know that Randyll√§ has 58 cards in total and he used 27 of them for building the tower and 53 for building the house. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of cards used for building the tower = 27
Number of cards used for building the house = 53 - 27 = 26

Now, let's find out how many bricks (or kives) Randyll√§ used to build each structure:

For the tower, he used 27 cards, which means he used 1 card per brick (since there are 27 bricks in one card). Therefore, he used 27 bricks for building the tower.

For the house, he used 26 cards, which means he used approximately 1.09 bricks per brick (since there are 26 bricks in one card). Therefore, he used around 28 bricks for building the house (since you cannot have a fraction of a brick).

So, to summarize:

Randyll√§ used 27 bricks for building the tower and 28 bricks for building the house.";
"Response:  We know that Randyll√§ has 37 cards in total and he used 33 cards for building the tower and 13 cards for building the house. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of cards = Number of cards used for tower + Number of cards used for house

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of cards = 33 + 13

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total number of cards = 46

Therefore, Randyll√§ built 46 more rooms in the tower than in the house.";
"Response:  We know that Randylla used 79 cards for building the tower and 82 cards for building the house. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of cards used for building the tower = 79
Number of cards used for building the house = 82 - 79 = 3

Now, let's find out how many more cards Randylla used to build the house than she did for the tower. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cards used for the tower from the number of cards used for the house:

Difference between the number of cards used for the house and the tower = 82 - 79 = 3

So, Randylla built 3 more layers in her house than she did in her tower.";
Response:  If Randy has 36 cards in front of him and he takes one card at a time from the deck, then after taking 59 cards, there will be 0 cards left in the deck. So, the number of cards remaining is 0.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Randylla built 20 cortices and 50 towers. We can assume that each tower has x number of rooms (lofts). Therefore, we have:

Number of rooms in towers = Number of towers x Number of rooms per tower
= 50 x x

Since Randylla built more rooms in the tower than in the house, we know that x > 20. So, there are at least 30 rooms in each tower.";
"Response:  The number of rooms in Randall's house is 90. If he builds the house from 89 lots and the tower from 63 lots, then the total number of rooms in both buildings is:

Rooms in House = Number of Lots x Number of Rooms per Lot
= 89 x 5 (assuming each lot has 5 rooms)
= 445 rooms

Since we know that Randall built more rooms in his house than in his tower, we can conclude that there are more than 445 rooms in Randall's house. Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 445 rooms.";
"Response:  The question is asking about the number of books read in the series ""Hullu tyhm√§ koulu"". We know that there are 20 different books in the series. So, if we haven't read any of them yet, then we have not read any books from the series. Therefore, the answer is 0.";
"Response:  The number of books in the series is given as 21 (13 + 8). So, the number of books in the series called ""Hullu tyhm√§ koulu"" is 21.";
"Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and you have read 12 of them. So, the number of books left to be read is:

22 - 12 = 10

So, you have 10 more books to read from the series.";
Response:  We know that there are four books and 17 movies in the series. If you have read 19 books, then you still need to watch 8 movies (4 - 19 = 8).;
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in total. If we subtract the number of movies (14) from the total number of items (books + movies), we get:

Total number of items = 16 + 14 = 30

Now, let's find out how many more books than movies there are:

Number of books = Total number of items - Number of movies = 30 - 14 = 16

So, there are 16 more books than movies in the series.";
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series and 10 movies. If we assume that each book is equivalent to one movie (which might not be true, but it makes calculations easier), then:

Books = Movies x 8/10 = 8
Movies = Books / 8 = 10
So, there are 10 more movies than books in the series. Therefore, the answer is 10.";
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in total. If we assume that you have read more books than movies (which is what the question implies), then we can calculate the number of books you have read as follows:

Books = Total Books - Number of Movies You Have Watched
= 10 - 12
= 8

So, you have read 8 books more than the number of movies you have watched.";
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in total. If we have read 7 books and watched 21 movies, then we have a total of:

Books read = 7
Movies watched = 21

So, to find out how many more movies we have watched than books we have read, we can subtract the number of books from the number of movies:

More movies than books = 21 - 7 = 14

Therefore, we have watched 14 more movies than books we have read.";
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the series that you have read so far and there are a total of 14 books in the series, then we can calculate the number of remaining books as follows:
Remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read
= 14 - 8
= 6
So, you still need to read 6 more books from the series.";
"Response:  We know that there are 62 movies and 19 books in total. If you have watched 34 movies and read 4 books, then we can calculate how many books you still have to read as follows:

Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books already read
= 19 - 4
= 15

So, you still have 15 books left to read.";
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in total. If we have read 7 books, then we still need to watch 4 movies. Therefore, the number of movies left for us to watch is 4.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 movies and 15 books in total. If we have watched 40 movies, it means we have not watched all of them. So, let's assume we have watched x movies out of 14. Similarly, if we have read 11 books out of 15, it means we have not read all of them either. Therefore, the number of books we have not read is 15 - 11 = 4. Hence, the number of books more than movies is 4.;
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in total. If we have watched 63 movies and read 13 books, then we can calculate how many more movies we have watched than books as follows:

Movies watched - Books read = (63 - 13) = 50

So, there are 50 more movies than books.";
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series. If we assume that you have read more books than movies, then we can say that you have read at least 10 books - 6 movies = 4 more books. So, the answer is 4.;
Response:  The number of movies in the series is 8, and you have watched 19 movies. Therefore, you have watched 19 - 8 = 11 more movies than books.;
Response:  We know that Dave has already won 7 flags and he bought them from toys. So, if he still has 2 flags left, then he must have used (7 + 2) = 9 flags to buy those toys.;
"Response:  We know that Dave has won 12 flags and he still has 14 left. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Dave's total number of flags = Number of flags he won + Number of flags he still has
= 12 + 14
= 26

Therefore, Dave won 26 flags in total.";
"Response:  If he has won 18 flags and bought 5 toys and 11 clothes, then we have:

Toys = 5 (from the previous question)
Clothes = 11 (from the previous question)
Total items = Toys + Clothes = 5 + 11 = 16

So, Dave is left with 18 - 16 = 2 flags.";
Response:  If he won 19 flags and used 12 lembas muffins and 7 other clothes for each flag, then we can calculate how many more flags he used lembas than clothes as follows: Number of flags = Total number of flags / Number of lembas muffins + Number of other clothes  = 19 / 12 + 7 = 10 Therefore, he used 10 more flags with lembas than with clothes.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Dave has won 13 flags. If he uses 8 flags for dolls and 18 flags for clothes, we can write an equation as follows:

Dave used 8 flags for dolls = 13 flags / 2 (since he has twice as many flags for dolls)

Substituting this value into the original equation, we get:

18 flags for clothes = 13 flags / 2

Now, let's solve for the number of flags Dave used for clothes:

18 = 6.5

So, Dave used 6 more flags for clothes than he did for dolls. In other words, he used 6 + 8 = 14 flags for clothes.";
Response:  We know that Dave has won 14 flags and lost 2, so he currently has 14 - 2 = 12 flags left. If he spends $10 on toys, then he will have $10 / $1 = 10 remaining dollars. Therefore, Dave still has 12 flags left after buying toys.;
Response:  The question states that there were 14 trees in total and 9 of them died due to the typhoon. So, we can calculate the number of trees that survived as follows: Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees - Number of trees that died = 14 - 9 = 5 trees. Therefore, 5 trees survived the typhoon.;
Response:  The tree had 13 branches and after the typhoon, 8 of them were left standing. So, how many more trees survived than died? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of dead branches (8) from the total number of branches (13). Therefore, the answer is 5.;
"Response:  We know that Haley had 20 sticks of firewood and after the typhoon, 4 sticks were left. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of sticks = 20 - Number of sticks remaining after typhoon

Now, let's solve for ""Number of sticks"" (x) in the equation:

Number of sticks = 20 - 4
= 16

Therefore, 16 sticks of firewood died during the typhoon.";
Response:  If 12 trees were left after the typhoon and Haley kasvatti them all in her garden, then she must have planted 6 trees initially (since there are 12 trees left). So, Haley planted 6/3 = 2 trees originally.;
"Response: 
Haley had 9 trees in her backyard before the typhoon. Then she planted 5 more trees after the typhoon. So, now Haley has how many trees left?
Let X be the number of trees Haley has left.
We know that X + 9 = 14 (since there were originally 9 trees).
Now we can solve for X:
X = 14 - 9 = 5
So, Haley has 5 trees left in her backyard.";
"Response:  After Taifuunin, two trees in Hayley's backyard died. If she had initially grown 12 trees, then how many trees does she have left now?

Step-by-step calculation:

Initially, Hayley grew 12 trees.
After Taifuun, 2 trees died.
So, the number of trees remaining = Initial number of trees - Number of trees that died.
= 12 - 2
= 10
Therefore, Hayley has 10 trees left in her backyard after Taifuun.";
Response:  If Haley had grown three trees initially and they all died in the typhoon, then there were originally three trees. Since 13 trees died after the typhoon hit, we can deduce that 10 (i.e., 13 - 3) trees survived the typhoon. Therefore, the answer is 10.;
Response:  If two trees died in Haley's backyard after Typhoon X, and he had grown 11 trees initially, then we can assume that there were 11 - 2 = 9 trees left alive after the typhoon. So, 9 trees survived the typhoon more than those that died.;
Response:  They collect 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 28 apples. So, they collect 66 x 28 = 1804 apples per day.;
Response:  If they collect 8 bags of apples per day and there are 24 bags in total, then it will take... (do the calculation)...days to collect all the apples.;
Response:  They have to fix 56 apples in total and they found out that the repair process will take 4 days. So, if they are fixing 56 apples per day, then...;
"Response:  The man collects 38 baskets of apples per day and each basket contains 42 apples. After 49 days, how many baskets of apples do they have in total?

Step-by-step calculation:
Day 1: Collected 38 baskets x 42 apples/basket = 1576 apples
Total apples after Day 1 = 1576 apples
Repeat this process for next 49 days...

After 49 days, the total number of baskets of apples collected is:
1576 + (49 x 1576) = 7064 baskets
Therefore, the man has 7064 baskets of apples after 49 days.";
Response:  They fix 66 baskets per day and each basket has 25 apples. So they have 66 x 25 = 1600 apples in total per day. After 87 days of harvesting, they will have 1600 x 87 = 134,600 apples.;
Response:  They collect 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 apples. So, they collect in total... (do the calculation);
Response:  If they fix 16 baskets per day and each basket has 57 apples, then in 80 baskets there are 80 x 57 = 4480 apples. So it takes 80 days to fix 4480 apples.;
Response:  If they collect 67 baskets per day and each basket contains 12 apples, then the total number of apples collected is 67 x 12 = 804 apples per day. To find out how many apples are corrected if 35 baskets are corrected, we can divide the total number of apples corrected by the number of baskets corrected: 804 apples / 35 baskets = 23 apples per basket. So, approximately 23 apples are corrected in each basket.;
"Response:  The farmer collects 74 baskets of apples per day and throws away 71. After 51 days of harvesting, how many baskets of apples do they have left?

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how many baskets of apples are collected and thrown away each day. We can then use this information to calculate the total number of baskets of apples that the farmer has after 51 days of harvesting.

So, let's break down the information given in the question:

* The farmer collects 74 baskets of apples per day.
* They throw away 71 baskets of apples per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of baskets of apples that the farmer has after 51 days of harvesting:

Total number of baskets = (Number of days x Number of baskets collected per day) - (Number of days x Number of baskets thrown away per day)
= (51 days x 74 baskets/day) - (51 days x 71 baskets/day)
= 3890 baskets - 3621 baskets
= 269 baskets

Therefore, after 51 days of harvesting, the farmer has 269 baskets of apples left.";
Response:  They collect 76 baskets per day and throw away 64. So they have 12 baskets left after throwing away. And in each basket, there are 50 apples. Therefore, they collect 12 x 50 = 600 apples per day.;
"Response:  They collect 28 apples per day and have 26 days of harvest left after today. So they will collect in total:

28 x 26 = 704 apples

Therefore, they have 704 apples in total.";
"Response:  They collect 82 baskets of ripe apples and 61 baskets of ripe apples per day. After 25 days, how many baskets of ripe apples do they have in total? 

Option (A): 82 + 61 = 143 baskets
Option (B): 82 x 25 = 2050 baskets
Option (C): 61 x 25 = 1525 baskets
Option (D): 143 - 82 = 61 baskets

Which option is correct?";
Response:  They collect 31 baskets of ripe apples and 24 baskets of ripe apples per day. How many baskets of unripe apples do they have after 45 days of harvesting?;
Response:  The first day they collected 44 sacks of ripe apples and 25 sacks of ripe apples per day. So in one day, they collected....................... sacks of ripe apples.;
Response:  If they collect 5 baskets of ripe apples and 74 baskets of ripe apples per day, then in one day they will have collected 5 + 74 = 79 baskets of ripe apples. Therefore, more than 79 baskets of apples are being corrected per day.;
"Response:  If they corrected 54 baskets of apples in total and they corrected 18 baskets per day, then we can calculate how many days it took to correct all the apples as follows:

Total number of baskets = 54
Number of baskets corrected per day = 18

To find out how many days it took to correct all the apples, divide the total number of baskets by the number of baskets corrected per day:

Days = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets corrected per day
= 54 / 18
= 3

Therefore, it took them 3 days to correct all the apples.";
"Response:  If they corrected 56 baskets of apples in total and they collected them for 14 days, then we can calculate how many baskets they collected per day as follows:

Total number of baskets = Number of baskets corrected / Number of days
= 56 / 14
= 4

So, they collected 4 baskets of apples per day.";
"Response:  They collect 25 baskets of unripe apples and 5 baskets of ripe apples per day. How many baskets of ripe apples do they have after 73 days? 

Rearrange the given information to formulate an equation:

Unripe apples collected = 25 x (days)
Ripe apples collected = 5 x (days)
Total number of apples collected = Unripe apples + Ripe apples

Now, substitute the values we know into the above equations:

Unripe apples collected = 25 x (73) = 1825
Ripe apples collected = 5 x (73) = 365
Total number of apples collected = 1825 + 365 = 2190

Therefore, after 73 days, they have 2190 baskets of ripe apples.";
Response:  After six days of harvesting, they have collected 65 + 46 = 111 sacks of unripe apples. So, they have 111 - 65 = 46 sacks of unripe apples left after six days of harvesting.;
Response:  The total number of apples collected is 41 + 86 = 127. So, the number of kyps√§√§ apple that are collected per day is 127 / 2 = 63.5. Therefore, approximately 64 kyps√§√§ apples are collected per day.;
Response:  If they collect 71 unripe apples and 60 ripe apples per day, then in one day they will have collected a total of 71 + 60 = 131 apples. Therefore, more than 131 apples are being corrected per day.;
Response:  The length of the room is given as 3 meters and its width as 3 meters too. So, we can say that the area of the room is equal to the product of its length and width, which is 9 square meters (3 x 3 = 9). Therefore, the length of the room is 9 / 2 = 4.5 meters long.;
Response:  We know that Jesse has a room that is 2 meters long and needs a carpet that covers an area of 14 square meters. To find out how wide the room is, we can use the formula: Area of the carpet = Length x Width. Since the length of the room is given as 2 meters, we need to find out what width will give us an area of 14 square meters. So, we divide 14 by 2 to get the width in meters: Width = 14 / 2 = 7 meters. Therefore, Jesse's room is 7 meters wide.;
Response:  The width of the room is two meters or 200 cm. Since we know that the length of the room is 4 meters (or 400 cm), we can calculate its area as follows: Area = Length x Width = 4 m x 2 m = 800 cm^2 Now, let's convert this value to square meters: Area in m^2 = 800 cm^2 / 100 = 8 m^2 Therefore, the length of the room is equal to 8 meters or 800 cm.;
Response:  The room is 3 meters long and 3 meters wide, so its area is 3 x 3 = 9 square meters. Since she already has 16 square meters of carpet, to cover the entire floor, she needs additional 9 - 16 = 7 square meters of carpet.;
Response:  The length of one side of the room is 2 meters and its width is 12 meters. To find out how many panels are needed to cover the entire wall, we need to divide the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wall (length x width) by the size of each panel (width x height). So, if we have a room that is 2 meters long and 12 meters wide, then the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãits walls is: Area = Length x Width = 2 x 12 = 24 square meters. Since each panel has a size of 1 meter x 1 meter = 1 square meter, we can calculate the number of panels needed as follows: Number of Panels = Total Area / Size of Each Panel = 24 / 1 = 24 panels. Therefore, you will need 24 panels to cover the entire wall of the room.;
Response:  The length of the room is 19 feet and its width is 18 feet. To find out how much carpeting he needs to cover the floor, we need to multiply the length and width of the room. So, the area of the room is 19 x 18 = 342 square feet. Since he has 20 rooms, he needs 342 square feet / 20 rooms = 17.1 square feet of carpeting per room.;
Response:  The length of the room is given as 19 meters and its width as 20 meters. Therefore, we can calculate the area of the room using the formula Area = Length x Width. So, the area of the room is 19 x 20 = 380 square meters. Now, to find out how long the room is, we need to divide the area by the width. So, the length of the room is 380 / 20 = 19 meters.;
Response:  We know that Jesse wants to cover his room with a carpet of size 10 square meters. Since we are given that the length of the room is 1.5 meters, we can calculate its width as follows: Width = Length / Area of Carpet Width = 1.5 meters / 10 square meters = 0.15 meters or 15 cm. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 15 cm.;
Response:  The area of the room is given as 10 square meters and it needs to be covered with a carpet that is 2 meters wide. So we can calculate the length of the room in meters as follows: Length = Area / Width = 10 / 2 = 5 meters. Therefore, the length of the room is 5 meters.;
Response:  The room is $2\text{ m} \times 6\text{ m} = 12\text{ m}^2$. To cover the entire floor with carpeting, we need to calculate how much carpeting is needed for each square meter of the room. Since there are 18 square meters in total, we can divide this number by 18 to find out how many square meters of carpeting are needed per square meter of room: $$ \frac{\text{Total area of carpeting}}{\text{Area of room}} = \frac{18\text{ m}^2}{\text{12\text{ m}^2}} = 1.5 \text{ m}^2 $$ So, to cover the entire floor with carpeting, Jessel will need $\boxed{1.5\text{ m}^2}$ of carpeting.;
Response:  The total amount of money they earned from selling T-shirts is $23 x 2 = $46. Since they earned $46 and sold $230 worth of T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 5 T-shirts ($230 / $46).;
Response:  The price of each T-shirt is $17. So if he sells three T-shirts, he will make $51 ($17 x 3).;
"Response:  We know that they sold 95 t-shirts in total and made $87 per shirt. So, their total revenue from selling t-shirts is:

$87 x 95 = $8325

Now, we want to find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game alone. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then their revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is:

$87 x 47 = $4069

So, the amount of money they made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is $4069.";
Response:  We know that they sold $106 for each t-shirt and they sold 242 t-shirts in total. So, if they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they must have sold 127 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game (242 - 115 = 127).;
Response:  We know that they sold $98 for each t-shirt and they sold a total of 163 shirts in both games. So, if they sold 89 shirts in the Arkansas game alone, then they made $89 x 89 = $7,521 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.;
Response:  We know that they sold $78 for each t-shirt and they sold 186 t-shirts in total. So, if they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they earned $13040 from selling t-shirts during that game ($78 x 172 = $13040). Now we need to find out how much money they earned from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Since they sold 186 t-shirts in total, and they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they must have sold 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game ($186 - $13040 = -$11954). Therefore, they did not earn any money from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.;
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is $62 x 183 = $11,506 and $99 x 31 = $3,079. So, they earned a total of $14,585 from selling T-shirts.;
"Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is given as $67 per T-shirt and $165 per paid shirt. Therefore, the total revenue from selling T-shirts is:

$67 x 74 = $4892 (T-shirts)

$165 x 156 = $25,300 (painted shirts)

So, they earned $25,300 from painting shirts.";
"Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts and shirts is $192 + $34 = $226. Since they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 shirts, we can calculate the average price of each item as follows:
T-shirt price = Total amount earned / Number of items sold = $226 / 157 = $1.45 per T-shirt
Shirt price = Total amount earned / Number of items sold = $226 / 19 = $11.67 per shirt
Therefore, a T-shirt costs more than a shirt ($1.45 vs. $11.67).";
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $86 and each paid is $232. So, we can calculate the total revenue from selling T-shirts as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt = 254 x $86 = $21,904. Similarly, for paid shirts, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = Number of paid shirts x Cost per paid shirt = 43 x $232 = $9,752. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a paid shirt and a T-shirt is: Difference = Paid Shirt Cost - T-Shirt Cost = $9,752 - $21,904 =-$12,152.;
"Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $51, and they sold 130 T-shirts during the game. So, their total revenue from selling T-shirts was:

Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt
= 130 x $51
= $6,430
Therefore, they earned $6,430 from selling T-shirts.";
"Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $201 and they sold 14 T-shirts in total. Therefore, the revenue from selling T-shirts was:
Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt
= 14 x $201
= $2850
So, they earned $2850 from selling T-shirts.";
"Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is $60. If they earn $10 for each T-shirt sold, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of T-shirts sold = Total amount earned / Amount per T-shirt
= $60 / $10
= 6 T-shirts

Therefore, Arkansas sold 6 T-shirts during the game.";
Response:  The total amount of money made from selling five T-shirts is $215. To calculate how much each shirt sold for, we can divide this total amount by the number of shirts sold: $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt.;
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is 20 + 64 = 84. Since they sell each T-shirt for $21.50, their total revenue from T-shirt sales is 84 x $21.50 = $1790. Therefore, they earned $1790 from selling T-shirts.;
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling shirts is $76 x 158 = $11,932 and from selling hoodies is $204 x 2 = $408. So, they earned a total of $11,932 + $408 = $12,340 from selling both types of clothing during the game.;
"Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $24 and that of each pair of shorts is $21. So, if they sold 177 pairs of shorts and 23 pairs of T-shirts, then their total revenue from sales would be:
Revenue = Number of pairs of shorts x Cost per pair + Number of pairs of T-shirts x Cost per pair
= 177 x $21 + 23 x $24
= $3,653 + $529
= $4,182
Therefore, the T-shirts cost more than the shorts.";
"Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling both types of shirts is given as $115 for each paycheck and $25 for each T-shirt. Since they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 regular shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas, we can calculate the average price of each type of shirt as follows:

Average price of regular shirts = Total amount of money earned / Number of shirts sold = $115 x 78 = $90 per shirt

Average price of T-shirts = Total amount of money earned / Number of T-shirts sold = $115 x 113 = $130 per shirt

Therefore, the T-shirts cost more than the regular shirts by $40 ($130 - $90).";
Response:  They have five tables and ten chairs. If they have more chairs than tables, then they must have... (do you want to know the answer?);
Response:  If they have two tables with the same number of chairs, and there are 12 chairs in total at the backyard, then each table has 6 chairs (since 12 / 2 = 6).;
Response:  If they have three tables with chairs and there are nine chairs in total at the backyard, then how many table sets do they have? We can assume that each set consists of one table and six chairs (three for each table). Therefore, the number of table sets is equal to the number of chairs divided by six, which is 9 / 6 = 1 1/3 or 1.5 table sets.;
Response:  If they have 11 plates and 13 chairs at the backyard party, then we can deduce that there are 11 + 13 = 24 people at the party. Since each person needs one chair, there are 24 chairs in total. Therefore, there is one chair for every two plates, so there are 5.5 chairs per plate (round up to 6). So, they have 6 chairs at the backyard party.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 tables and 6 chairs in total. If 11 people sit at the chairs, then we can deduce that 5 chairs are empty (since 11 > 6). Therefore, there are 5 free chairs available.;
"Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and 14 chairs in total. Since there are six extra chairs, we can assume that each table has two extra chairs. Therefore, the number of people at each table is:

12 tables x 2 chairs per table = 24 people

So, there are 24 people attending the party.";
Response:  We know that there are four table settings and three chairs for each setting. So in total, we have... (calculate)...4 x 3 = 12 seating arrangements. Since there will be 14 guests attending the party, they will need to sit at these 12 tables. Therefore, they will need to buy 12 chairs.;
Response:  If they have 14 chairs for every table and there are 9 tables in total, then the number of chairs is equal to 14 x 9 = 126 chairs. So, they have more than 9 tables.;
Response:  If Jos Lewis makes $460 in five weeks, that means he earns $92 per week ($460 / 5 = $92).;
"Response:  If Lewis earned $1216 and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks it took him to earn that amount as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks

Therefore, Lewis worked for 78 weeks to earn $1216.";
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks and pays $702 in taxes, he will have $3458 left after paying taxes. So at the end of harvest season, Lewis has $3458.;
"Response:  If Jos Lewis earns $1357 per week and works for 223 weeks in a year, his total income would be:
$1357 x 223 = $294,063
So, if he works 73 harvesting seasons, his total income would be:
$294,063 / 73 = $4008 per season";
Response:  If Lewis earns $28 per week and works for 40 weeks in a year, he will have earned $1,120 ($28 x 40) during that time period. Additionally, if he works overtime every week, his total income would be $1,579 ($1,120 + $459). Therefore, during an Elongated Season, Lewis would have earned $1,579.;
Response:  If he earns $403 per week and pays $49 in rent per week, his net income is $354 ($403 - $49). During harvest season, he makes an additional $176 per week (based on the given percentage of increase). Therefore, during harvest season, he will have a total income of $530 per week ($354 + $176).;
"Response:  If he earns $368 per week and has to pay $388 in rent every week for 13 weeks (or 1 month), then he will have paid a total of:

$368 x 13 = $4,724 in income during that period.

Now, let's calculate how much he pays in rent over that same period:

$4,724 x $388 = $1,705,360 in rent.

So, he pays $1,705,360 in rent during the harvest season.";
Response:  If he earns $491 per week and pays $216 in rent every week, then his total income is $491 - $216 = $275 per week. Since there are 11 weeks left before harvest time, he has earned a total of $275 x 11 = $3025 during that period. Therefore, at harvest time, he will have $3025 - $216 (rent paid) = $2809 remaining.;
Response:  According to the question, Lewis has collected $133 in 19 weeks. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide the total amount by the number of weeks: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.;
Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week, he has earned $178 in total after 89 weeks (or 20 months). So, the harvest lasted for approximately 20 months.;
Response:  If they decided to go swimming and the water is 10 times deeper than Dean's height, then... (1) The depth of the water is equal to 10 x Dean's height = 10 x 9 = 90 meters. So, the water is 90 meters deep compared to Dean's height.;
Response:  We know that Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron and that the water is twice as deep as Dean. So, if Dean is 2 meters deeper in the water than Ron, then Ron must be 4 meters below the surface of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water is 8 meters (2 x 4 = 8).;
Response:  The height of Ron is 12 meters and Dean is 3 meters shorter than him, so Dean's height is 9 meters. Since they decided to go swimming in water that is five times deeper than Ron's height, the depth of the water is 5 x 12 = 60 meters.;
Response:  We know that Dean is two meters taller than Ron and that the water depth is 15 times greater than Dean's height. So if we let D be Dean's height (which is 2m + 1.5m = 3.5m), then the water depth is 15D = 15(3.5) = 52.5 m. Therefore, the water was 52.5 meters deep.;
Response:  The water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, so if Ron is at a depth of 4 meters, then the water must be at least 64 meters deep (16 x 4 = 64).;
Response:  We know that Ron is 4.5 meters tall and Dean is 1.5 meters shorter than him, so Dean is 2.5 meters tall. The water is nine times deeper than Dean, so the depth of the water is 9 x 2.5 = 22.5 meters deep.;
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and divides them into two shelves, then each shelf will have 17 books (34 / 2 = 17). So, there are 17 books in each shelf.;
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf has two books, then he must have... (1)

Step-by-step solution:
Let B be the number of shelves Brian has. Since each shelf has 2 books, the total number of books Brian has is 42 = 2 √ó B. (1)
Now we want to find out how many shelves Brian has. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by the number of books on each shelf: B = 42 / 2 = 21. (2)
So, Brian has 21 shelves.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Brian has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves. Therefore, he has a total of:

* Number of books = 27 x 23 = 611 books
* Number of magazines = 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines

So, Brian has a total of 611 books and 1840 magazines.";
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book has 46 pages (leaves), then he has a total of 9 x 46 = 404 pages or leaves in his ten bookshelves.;
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Brian has 23 books and 61 newspapers. Since each newspaper is in 29 bookshelves, we can calculate the total number of newspapers as follows:

Total number of newspapers = Number of newspapers per shelf x Total number of shelves
= 61 newspapers / 29 bookshelves
= 2.07 newspapers per shelf

Now, let's find out how many books Brian has in total. We know that he has 23 books, so their total number is also equal to the number of bookshelves multiplied by the number of books per shelf:

Total number of books = Number of books per shelf x Total number of shelves
= 23 books / 29 bookshelves
= 0.83 books per shelf

Therefore, Brian has a total of 23 + 2.07 (newspapers) = 25.07 books and 61 + 0.83 (books) = 61.83 newspapers in his collection.";
Response:  We know that Brian has seven bookshelves and each shelf contains an equal number of books. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of books in x shelves = Total number of books / Number of shelves. In this case, the total number of books is given as 28, so we can substitute it into the above equation to get: Number of books in x shelves = 28 / 7 = 4. So, there are four books in each of Brian's seven bookshelves.;
Response:  If Brian has 38 books in total and each shelf has two books, then we can say that...;
Response:  If Carol sends invitations to 10 friends and each package contains two invitations, then we need... (calculate)...packages of invitations to make sure that no one is left out. Therefore, the answer is... (write your answer).;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 12 friends and bought three packages with an equal number of invitations in each package, then there are 12 x 3 = 36 invitations in total.;
"Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to 5 friends and bought 7 packs of invitations with each containing 10 invitations, then:

Number of invitations sent = Number of friends x Number of packs = 5 x 7 = 35

So, there are 35 - 2 (the number of invitations she sent to her two friends) = 33 invitations left over.";
Response:  If Carol sent birthday invitations to her friends in six packages of 14 each, then she had 6 x 14 = 84 invitations in total. Since she bought 6 additional invitations, she now has 84 + 6 = 90 invitations in total. Therefore, Carol can invite up to 90 friends to her party.;
Response:  If Carol wants to invite 9 friends and she has already sent out 3 invitations, then she needs to buy additional invitations for 6 more friends (since each pack contains 3 invitations). Therefore, she needs to buy 6 extra invitations.;
"Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game she played and she scored a total of 36 points, then she must have played x games where x is the number of games she played. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 
x \* 12 = 36
Solving for x, we get: x = 3
So, Melissa played 3 games.";
"Response:  If Melissa played three games and got a total of 81 points, then she must have scored x points in each game. We can write an equation as follows:
x + x + x = 81... (1)
Since Melissa played three games, we know that x represents her score in each game. So, we can substitute x with 3x to get rid of the repetition:
3x + 3x + 3x = 81... (2)
Now, simplify the equation:
9x = 81... (3)
Divide both sides by 9:
x = 9... (4)
Therefore, Melissa scored 9 points in each game.";
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points for every game. So, her total score is:

Total score = (109 x Number of games) + (82 x Bonus points)
= (109 x 79) + (82 x 3)
= 8564 + 246
= 8810
Therefore, Melissa scored 8810 points in 79 games.";
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 21 points in some games and she scored 7 points in each game. So, if we divide 21 by 7, we get the number of games played by Melissa, which is 3. Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and played 13 games, then she must have scored an average of 7 points per game (91/13 = 7). So, Melissa scored 7 points in each of her 13 games.;
Response:  If there are four seats in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride at once, then each seat has to accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5). Therefore, each seat can hold 5 people.;
Response:  If there are 9 people in each place and 18 people can drive at the same time, then we have to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many places there are. So, the number of places is 18 / 9 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 places on the Ferris wheel.;
Response:  If there are 20 bicycles and each bike has 19 seats, then the total number of seats available is 20 x 19 = 380 seats. Since each seat can accommodate 15 people, the maximum number of people who can ride at the same time is 380 / 15 = 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.;
Response:  If there are 18 seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 18 x 15 = 270 people. Since 10 seats are broken, we have to subtract that number from the total capacity. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is 270 - 10 = 260 people.;
Response:  If there are six seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can hold 14 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since there are already 16 people in the Ferris wheel, we have reached the maximum capacity. Therefore, no more people can join the Ferris wheel.;
"Response:  We know that there are two small areas with 23 seats in total. In each small area, there are 14 seats available for children and 54 seats available for adults. Therefore, we can calculate the maximum number of people who can fit in the small areas as follows:
Maximum capacity = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat
= 14 + 54 = 68
So, the maximum number of people who can fit in the small areas is 68. Now let's move to the large area. There are 23 seats available in this area, and we know that all of them are for adults. So, the maximum number of adults who can fit in the large area is:
Maximum capacity = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat
= 23 x 54 = 1208
Therefore, the maximum number of people who can fit in both areas combined is:
Maximum capacity = Small area capacity + Large area capacity
= 68 + 1208 = 1276
So, the answer to the question is 1276.";
"Response:  We know that there are three small seats and seven large seats in the garden. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, and each large seat can accommodate 12 people. Therefore, we have:
Small seats: 3 x 16 = 48 people
Large seats: 7 x 12 = 84 people
So, altogether, we can accommodate 48 + 84 = 132 people in the garden.";
Response:  If 16 people can drive a car at the same time and there are four seats in each car, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit in each seat. So, the answer is 4.;
"Response:  If four people can ride a bicycle at the same time, and each seat in the bicycle can hold two people, then we have:
Number of seats = Number of riders / 2
= 4 / 2
= 2
So there are 2 seats in the bicycle for the four people to ride together.";
Response:  If we have seven pizzas and each pizza has the same number of cold toppings, then there are 7 x 14 = 98 cold toppings in total. Since there is one cold topping for every four hot toppings (pizza dough), there are 98 / 4 = 24 hot toppings per pizza. Therefore, there are 24 leivettyt (hot toppings) in each pizza.;
Response:  If there are 28 pieces of dough and each piece can be divided into two slices (viilut), then we have 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas. Therefore, we tilasimme 14 pizzas.;
Response:  We have 25 people and each person has 4 slices of pizza, so... (insert calculation here);
Response:  If we have nine pizzas and each pizza has ten slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90. Since there are two of us, we will get 90 / 2 = 45 slices of pizza.;
"Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted seeds in 45 flowerpots. Since each pot contains 10 seeds, we have:

Number of seeds = 45 x 10 = 450 seeds

Therefore, they planted 450 seeds in total.";
Response:  If they planted 9 flowers with 45 seeds each, then they planted a total of 45 x 9 = 395 seeds. So, they planted 395 seeds in the flower bed.;
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total. They put 12 seeds in each of 3 pots, so they had 3 pots. Now, we need to find out how many seedlings grew in each pot. According to the question, only 58 seedlings grew into flowers out of the 12 seeds in each pot, so the number of seedlings that grew in each pot is 58/12 = 4.75. Since you can't have a fraction of a pot, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 pots. Therefore, Paige and her mother had 5 pots.;
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds in total. They put 15 seeds in the flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in the flower bed. So, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total number of seeds x Percentage of seeds that grew into flowers Total number of seeds = 55 Seeds grown into flowers = 60 Seeds (since they are equivalent to 100%) Therefore, the number of flowers is: Number of flowers = 55 x 60/100 = 33 flowers.;
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each pot, then they had 10 pots. If they froze 60 seeds, that means they have 60 / 10 = 6 pots left. So, Paige and her mother had 10 + 6 = 16 pots of flowers.;
Response:  If they planted 8 bouquets of flowers and each bouquet has 32 seeds, then they planted a total of 8 x 32 = 256 seeds in all.;
Response:  If Matthew gave two cookies to each of his three friends, then he had 2 x 3 = 6 cookies in total.;
Response:  If Matthew gave two cookies to each of his eight friends, then he gave a total of 16 cookies (2 x 8 = 16). So, he gave one cookie to four friends and three cookies to four other friends.;
Response:  If Matthew gave 15 cookies to his friends and he had 10 left after that, then each friend must have eaten at least 3 cookies (since there are 15 - 10 = 5 remaining). So, the number of cookies each friend ate is 3.;
Response:  If Matthew gave 24 cookies to his friends and he had 17 left over, that means he gave each friend 24 / 3 = 8 cookies. So, Matthew gave 8 cookies to each of his three friends.;
"Response:  If Matthew gave out 22 cookies and 34 cakes to his 11 friends, then each friend received:

Cookies: 22 / 11 = 2 cookies per person
Cakes: 34 / 11 = 3 cakes per person
Therefore, each of Matthew's friends s√∂i 2 cookies and 3 cakes.";
Response:  If Matthew gave out 29 cookies and 30 cakes to his friends, then he must have given each friend x cookies and y cakes, where x + y = 59 (the total number of items given). Since each cookie is worth 1/4 of a cake, we can write x = 14 (since 14 x = 59). Therefore, each friend received 14 cookies and 30 cakes, which means that each friend sough 30 / 14 = 2.14 cakes.;
"Response:  If Matthew gave out 14 cookies and 21 cakes to his 7 friends, then each friend received:

Cookies: 14 / 7 = 2 per person (on average)
Cakes: 21 / 7 = 3 per person (on average)
So, each of Matthew's friends s√∂i 2 cookies and 3 cakes in total.";
Response:  If Matthew had 36 cookies and wanted to share them equally among his 18 friends, each friend would get 2 cookies (36/18 = 2).;
Response:  If Matthew has 36 cookies and he wants to share them equally among his 4 friends, then each friend will get 9 cookies (36/4 = 9).;
Response:  If Matthew has 23 cookies and he gave equal number of cookies to his two friends, then each friend got 23/2 = 11 cookies. So, each friend s√∂i 11 cookies.;
"Response:  We know that Matthew has 31 cookies and he gave some to his friends. So, let's say he gave x cookies to his friends. Now we have:

Matthew has 31 cookies ------------------------------ (1)
He gave x cookies to his friends

Now, we are asked how many cookies Matthew gave to his friends. So, we can substitute the value of x in equation (1):

31 - x = 23

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, Matthew gave 9 cookies to his friends.";
Response:  If Matthew had 32 creations and gave them equally to all people, then each person would have received 32/number of people = 0.4 creations per person. Since there are 98 kakkua (cookies), each person would have eaten 0.4 creations / 98 kakkua = 0.0041 creations per cookie. Therefore, each person ate approximately 0.0041 creations for every cookie they ate.;
Response:  If Matthew had initially 10 ideas and 8 cakes, then he gave away 2 ideas to each of his friends. So, now he has 10 - 2 = 8 ideas left. And if he gave away 3 cakes to each friend, then he has 8 - 3 = 5 cakes left. Therefore, each friend ate 5 cakes.;
Response:  If Matthew had 28 friends and he gave each of them one cookie (kakku), then he would have given away 28 cookies in total. Now, if he also gave each friend one cake (keksia), then he would have given away 28 cakes as well. So, in total, Matthew gave away 28 + 28 = 56 treats to his friends.;
"Response:  If she drank 109 bottles in one day and the duration of drinking was 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she had purchased as follows:

Number of bottles = Total amount drunk / Amount drunk per day
= 109 / 74
= 1.48
So, Debbie had purchased approximately 1.48 bottles.";
"Response:  If Debbie had 153 bottles of wine and she drank the same number every day for 17 days, then she would have drunk 
$$ \text {153} \times \frac{\text{days}}{\text{bottles}} = 153 \times 17 = 2495 $$ bottles in total. So, she drank $2495$ bottles of wine in $17$ days.";
"Response:  If Debbie had 264 bottles of wine and she drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, then she would have drunk in total:

264 bottles x 11 days = 2910 bottles (drunk)

So, Debbie has 73 bottles left (2910 - 15 x 11 = 73).";
Response:  If Debbie drank 301 bottles of water when they were on sale and she drinks 144 bottles per day for several days, then we can calculate how many days she has been drinking using the number of remaining bottles. So, if she has 157 bottles left, it means that she has drunk for x days where x = 157 / 144 = 2.86 days. Therefore, Debbie has been drinking for approximately 2 days and 10 hours.;
"Response:  If Debbie had 88 vesipulloja and 13 limsaa when they were on sale, that means she bought them at an original price of $x per unit. Then, if she drank 4 vesipulloa and 87 limsaa per day while they were on sale for $y per unit, her total cost would be:

Total Cost = Number of units x Original Price + Number of units x Discounted Price
= 4 x $x + 87 x $y

We know that Debbie spent a total of $560 on drinks, so we can set up the equation:

$560 = Total Cost

Now we have two equations:

4x + 87y = 560... (1)
x + y = 88... (2)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = $10
y = $5

So, the original price of each vesipullo was $10, and the discounted price was $5. Therefore, one vesipullo lasts for 2 days ($10 / $5).";
Response:  If Debbie had 200 vests and 256 mugs when they were on sale, that means she bought them at an average price of $X per unit. Then, if she drank 312 vest pullojas and 4 mugs per day, we can calculate how many days it would take for her to drink all those mugs using simple arithmetic. So, in this case, the number of days it takes Limsa to last is approximately 789 days or about 2 years.;
Response:  If Debbie buys 12 water bottles and she drinks one per day, then in total she will need 12 days to finish them all. So, the answer is 12 days.;
"Response:  If Debbie drinks 15 water bottles and 54 Limsaa per day, we can calculate how many days one water bottle lasts as follows:

Days = (Total amount of drink / Amount drunk per day) √∑ Number of water bottles
= (95 liters + 180 liters) √∑ 15
= 630 liters √∑ 15
= 42 liters per day

So, one water bottle will last for approximately 42 liters per day.";
Response:  If she drinks 122 vesipulloa and 9 Limsa per day, then in one day she drank (122 + 9) = 131 liquid units. Since we know that each Limsa contains 360 ml of liquid, then the total amount of Liquid she consumed from Limsa is (9 x 360) = 3180 ml. Now, since we are given that she has 360 Limsaa and 162 Vesipulloa, we can calculate how many days it would take her to finish both of them. We will divide the total amount of liquids she consumes daily by the number of liters in each Limsa and Vesipullo respectively. So, the number of days it takes her to finish both Limsaa and Vesipulloa is: Number of days = Total amount of liquid consumed / Amount of liquid in each Limsa and Vesipullo. In this case, the calculation would be: Number of days = 3180 ml / 360 ml = 9 days. Therefore, if she drinks 122 vesipulloa and 9 Limsa per day, it would take her approximately 9 days to finish both of them.;
Response:  In total there are 14 rows and each row has 11 pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils Faye has is: 14 x 11 = 154 pencils.;
"Response:  If Faye has 12 cans and she wants to arrange them in three rows, then we need to divide the number of cans by the number of rows. So, if there are 3 rows, each row will have how many cans? ü§î

Option (B) - 6 cans per row 
Option (C) - 9 cans per row 
Which option is correct?";
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 packs of 24 each, so in total she has 28 x 24 = 672 kyn√§it√§. Since we want to divide them into rows or rivets, let's assume that she can make 16 rows (or rivets) with these kyn√§√§t. Therefore, the number of rows Faye can make is 672 / 16 = 43 rows.;
Response:  We know that there are 22 kyn√§ss in each row and Faye has 6 rows of kyn√§ri. Therefore, the total number of kyn√§ri is 22 x 6 = 132. So, Faye has 132 kyn√§ri.;
"Response:  If Faye has 35 regular pencils and 7 colored pencils, she can make 35 rows of 5 pencils each. Since each row requires 5 pencils, we have:

35 / 5 = 7 rows with regular pencils

Now, let's consider the colored pencils. Each row requires 5 colored pencils, so we have:

7 / 5 = 1 1/2 rows with colored pencils

Therefore, Faye can make 7 rows with regular pencils and 1 1/2 rows with colored pencils, for a total of 8 1/2 rows.";
Response:  In total, there are 19 rows in the grid. Each row has either 4 or 5 knives (kyn√§). Therefore, we can conclude that each row contains at most 4 + 5 = 9 knives. Since there are 19 rows, the total number of knives is 19 x 9 = 161. So, Faye has 161 knives.;
"Response:  In total, there are 7 rows with 36 kyn√§√§ and 30v√§rikyn√§√§ in each row. Therefore, the number of violet pencils Faye has is equal to the number of rows multiplied by the number of violet pencils in each row. So, we can write:
Faye has x violet pencils.
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:
x = (7 rows) √ó (36 kyn√§√§/row) + (30 v√°lkyn√§√§/row)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 240 + 90
So, Faye has 330 violet pencils.";
Response:  We are given that Faye has 11 rows of knitting and each row contains 31 knots and 27 variegated knots. Therefore, in total, Faye has....................... knots and.............. variegated knots.;
Response:  If Faye has 30 balls and each ball contains 5 marbles, then the total number of marbles is 30 x 5 = 150 marbles. Since she wants to divide them into rows, we need to find out how many rows can be formed with 150 marbles. To do this, we can use division. We know that 150 divided by 5 (the number of marbles in each row) gives us 30 rows. So, Faye can make 30 rows of marbles.;
Response:  If Faye has 6 pencils and she wants to divide them into two rows of equal length, then we can assume that each row will have an equal number of pencils. Therefore, if Faye sets aside x pencils for one row, then she will have 6 - x pencils left over for the second row. Since Faye has 6 pencils in total, we can set up the equation: 6 = x + (6 - x). Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, Faye sets aside 3 pencils for each row.;
Response:  We know that there are 35 packages of chopsticks and each package contains 4 chopsticks. So, in total, we have 35 x 4 = 140 chopsticks. Since he arranged them into rows and columns, we can assume that he had 140 / 2 = 70 chopsticks in each row. Therefore, he could make 70 rows of chopsticks.;
Response:  We know that there are 31 packages of pencils and each package contains 6 pencils. So, in total, we have 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Since he arranged them into rows of 19 pencils each, then he has 186 / 19 = 10 pencils left over. Therefore, the number of pencils Fayn has is 10 + 186 = 196 pencils.;
"Response:  We have 30 rows of kylies and each row has either 71 or 24 kylies. Therefore, we can write an equation:

Total number of kylies = Number of rows x Number of kylies in each row
= 30 x (71 + 24) / 2
= 30 x 95 / 2
= 675

So, Faye has 675 kylies in total.";
"Response:  We know that Faye has 16 rows of knitting and each row contains either 6 or 7 knots. Therefore, we can write an equation:

Faye has 16 rows of knitting, so the total number of knots = 16 x (number of knots in one row)
= 16 x (6 + 7)
= 16 x 13
= 208 knots
Therefore, Faye has 208 colored knots and 21 white knots.";
"Response:  We know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 15 passengers (as assumed), we have:
Number of seats per bus = 7 x 15 = 105 seats
Since all buses are full, we have:
Total number of seats available for the trip = Number of buses x Number of seats per bus = 7 x 105 = 735 seats
Therefore, each bus has approximately 735/7 = 105 seats.";
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 buses are full. This means that each bus has 118 seats. Now we need to find out how many students are in the school. To do this, we can divide the number of buses (95) by the number of seats per bus (118). So, the total number of students in the school is: 95 / 118 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 students in the school.;
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in total and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, we have:

Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Number of students per classroom
= 67 x 66
= 4302

Since there are six seats available in each bus, we need:

Number of buses required = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus
= 4302 / 6
= 717

Therefore, we require 717 buses for the trip.";
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students (58). Therefore, we can say that the total number of students in all classrooms is also 87 x 58 = 4960. Since there are two buses available for the trip, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many buses are required: 4960 / 2 = 2480. So, we need 2 buses for the trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students. Therefore, we can say that the total number of students in all classrooms is 24 x 120 = 2880. Since there are 84 seats in each bus, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus to find out how many students can fit in one bus. So, the answer is 2880 / 84 = 35 students per bus.;
Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms in the school and 102 students attending it. If 22 students do not want to go on the trip, then we need to calculate how many buses will be needed for the remaining students. To do this, we divide the number of students who want to go on the trip (102 - 22 = 80) by the capacity of each bus (8). So, we need 10 buses (80 / 8 = 10). Therefore, 10 buses will be needed if 22 students do not want to go on the trip.;
Response:  If there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in each classroom, then the total number of students in the school is 102 x 11 = 1122 students. Since 99 students can fit in each bus, the total number of buses needed to transport all the students for the trip is 1122 / 99 = 11.34 buses. So, approximately 11 buses will be needed for the trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in total and each bus can accommodate 3 students. So, we need to divide the number of students (111) by the capacity of each bus (3). Therefore, we will need 37 buses for the trip.;
"Response:  We know that there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 17 students (as there are 17 classrooms), we can calculate the number of buses needed to transport all the students as follows:

Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus
= 92 / 17
= 5.3 buses

So, approximately 5.3 buses would be needed to transport all the students if every bus is full.";
Response:  If there are n boys and each boy gets 9 gold coins, then the total number of gold coins given is 9n. Since Haley has x gold coins, we can write the equation: 9n = x. Solving for n, we get n = 4. So, there are 4 boys in total, and Haley gave each of them 9 gold coins, hence she had 9 + 9 = 18 gold coins initially.;
Response:  If there are 10 boys and each boy received 5 marbles from Hayley, then the total number of marbles distributed is 5 x 10 = 50 marbles. So, Hayley gave 50 marbles to each of the 10 boys.;
Response:  If there are 23 boys and each boy wants to have 15 balls, then we need to divide 23 by 15 to find out how many gold coins they will get. So, the answer is 150 (23 / 15).;
"Response:  If there are 13 boys who love playing ball games and 50 boys who like playing cards, then we can say that each boy likes to play either ball games or cards with probability 1/2. Therefore, the number of boys who like playing both ball games and cards is equal to the total number of boys minus twice the number of boys who like only one of these activities. So, the number of boys who like playing both ball games and cards is given by:

Number of boys = Total number of boys - (2 x Number of boys who like only one activity)
= 26 - (2 x 13)
= 26 - 26
= 0
Therefore, none of the boys in Halyll√§ like playing both ball games and cards.";
Response:  If Haleylla has 20 gold coins and there are other boys in her class who want to play ball games with her, then we can assume that she will divide the coins equally among them. So, if there are x boys in her class, each boy will get 20/x gold coins.;
Response:  If Haley has 28 gold coins and gives two to each of her four sons, then she gave a total of 4 x 2 = 8 gold coins to them. So, there are 28 - 8 = 20 gold coins left with Haley.;
Response:  The book had 392 pages and he read 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it took him to make the book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Reading speed in pages per day. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Frank took 27 days to write his book.;
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish reading the book. So, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows: Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages per day Total pages = 569 x 22 = 12380 pages Therefore, there are approximately 12,380 pages in the book.;
"Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish reading the book which has 612 pages and is divided into 24 chapters. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Total number of pages = Number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to finish reading the book
= 612 / 6
= 102 pages/day

So, Frank read 102 pages per day.";
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish writing his book of 555 pages divided into five chapters. To find out how many pages each chapter had, we can use the following formula: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of pages in each chapter = 555 / 5 = 111 pages per chapter. Therefore, each chapter had approximately 111 pages.;
Response:  We know that Frank took 193 days to write his book and it was divided into 15 chapters. Therefore, he wrote one chapter per day. Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank read each day. Since the book had 660 pages in total, Frank read 660/15 = 44 pages per chapter. So, he read 44 pages per day.;
Response:  We know that Frank read three books and each book had 249 pages. Therefore, he read a total of 3 x 249 = 747 pages in three days. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he took to read them: 747 pages / 3 days = 249 pages per day.;
Response:  We know that Frank read 66 pages per book and it took him 12 days to finish reading one book. Therefore, he read 66 x 12 = 792 pages in total during those 12 days. Now, we need to find out how many books Frank read in total. Since he had 492 days, he could have read at most 492 / 12 = 40 books per year. So, Frank read 40 x 4 = 160 books in total.;
"Response:  If it took him 16 days to write the book and he read 112 pages per day, then we can calculate his reading speed as follows:

Days = 16
Pages = 112
Reading Speed = Pages / Days
= 112 / 16
= 7 pages per day
Therefore, Frank Luki read 7 pages per day while writing his book.";
Response:  If he read 8 pages per day and there are 576 pages in total, then it will take him... (do calculation)...days to finish reading the book.;
"Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to write his book and there were 450 pages in total. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he wrote per day as follows:

Pages written per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to write the book
= 450 pages / 30 days
= 15 pages per day

So, Frank wrote 15 pages per day during the 30 days it took him to finish writing his book.";
"Response:  Since there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:
Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter
= 3 x 594
= 1782
Now, since Frank took 607 days to complete the book, we can calculate the average time taken to write one page as follows:
Average time taken to write one page = Total pages / Time taken to complete the book
= 1782 / 607
= 2.9 pages/day
So, Frank wrote approximately 2.9 pages every day for 607 days to complete his book.";
"Response:  We know that Frank wrote two chapters in his book and each chapter had 405 pages. Therefore, he wrote a total of 2 x 405 = 810 pages in his book. Since it took him 664 days to write the book, we can calculate how many pages he wrote per day as follows:

Pages written/day = Total pages written / Number of days taken
= 810 pages / 664 days
= 1.23 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 1.23 pages every day during the time he spent writing his book.";
Response:  The cost of one DVD is $15. Since there are 8 DVDs in the package, their total cost would be $15 x 8 = $120. So, the price of the entire package is $120.;
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages would cost:
$81 x 33 = $2693
Therefore, buying 33 DVD packs would cost $2693.";
"Response:  If one DVD package costs $107, then we can calculate how many packages we can buy with $93 as follows:
$93 / $107 = 0.85 (or approximately 85%)
So, you can buy 85% of 1 DVD package with $93, which is:
$93 x 0.85 = $78.25
Therefore, you can buy 78 DVD packages with $93.";
"Response:  The original price of the package is $76, and there is an discount of $25. To find out how much you have to pay for the package, we can use the following formula:

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

In this case, the discount percentage is 25/76 = 0.32 or 32%. So, we can calculate the discounted price as follows:

Discounted Price = Original Price x (1 - Discount Percentage)
= $76 x (1 - 0.32)
= $76 x 0.68
= $50

Therefore, you will have to pay $50 for the package.";
"Response:  If you have $104 and want to buy X DVD packages where each package costs $26, then we can write an equation as follows:

$104 = x \times $26

Now, divide both sides of the equation by $26 to solve for X:

X = $104 / $26
= 4

So, you can buy 4 DVD packages with your $104.";
Response:  If we buy two DVD packs for $28, then each pack costs half of that amount or $14 per pack.;
"Response:  We have 18 bananas and we want to group them into smaller sets or groups called ""ryhmi"". So, how many groups of bananas can we make if we divide them equally among 3 or more groups?

Let's assume that we have 3 groups (or ryhmi) for our 18 bananas. Therefore, each group will contain 6 bananas (18 / 3 = 6).";
"Response:  If there are 140 groups of bananas and each group has x bananas, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = Total number of bananas / Number of groups of bananas
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
x = (Number of bananas in the collection) / 140
Now, we need to find out how many bananas are in the collection. According to the question, the total number of bananas is equal to 360. Therefore, we can plug this value into our equation:
x = 360 / 140
Simplifying the fraction, we get:
x = 2.5
So, the person has 2.5 bananas in their collection.";
Response:  We have 203 bananas and 63 apples in total. If we divide them equally among seven groups of bananas and nine groups of apples, respectively, then...;
"Response:  We have 142 bananas and 356 apples in total. If we divide them equally among 47 groups of bananas and 178 groups of apples, respectively, then each group will contain:

Number of bananas per group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 142 / 47 = 3

Similarly, the number of apples per group can be calculated as follows:

Number of apples per group = Total number of apples / Number of groups = 356 / 178 = 2

Therefore, each group of apples contains 2 apples.";
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in total and each group has an average of 392 bananas. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bananas per group as follows: Number of bananas per group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2 So, each group contains approximately 2 bananas.;
Response:  If there are 18 groups of bananas and each group contains 18 bananas, then the total number of bananas in all groups is 18 x 18 = 324. So, there are 324 bananas in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 87 apples and 290 bananas in total. If we divide the bananas into two groups of equal size, each group will have 145 bananas (since 290 / 2 = 145). Now, if we divide the apples into 93 groups, each group will have 9 apples (since 87 / 9 = 9). So, the size of each banaaniryhm√§ is 145 bananas, and the size of each appelsiiniryhm√§ is 9 apples.;
Response:  We know that there are 384 apples and 192 bananas in total. The bananas are divided into 345 groups of 1-3 bananas each, so the number of bananas per group is 345 x 3 = 1035. Similarly, the apples are divided into 16 groups of 1-16 apples each, so the number of apples per group is 16 x 1 = 16. Therefore, the size of each apple group is 16.;
Response:  If Brendan's mother made 38 cakes and each cake had 19 pieces, then she gave away 670 pieces of cake (38 x 19 = 670). So there were 670 guests at the party.;
"Response:  If Brendan's mother made cookies for 14 people and each person had 30 cookies, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many cookies were given to each of the 14 people.
Number of cookies per person = Total number of cookies / Number of people = 300 cookies / 14 people = 21 cookies per person

Step 2: Now calculate how many cookies Brendan's mother actually made in total.
Total number of cookies made by Brendan's mother = Number of people x Number of cookies per person = 14 people x 21 cookies per person = 284 cookies

Therefore, Brendan's mother made 284 cookies in total.";
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Brendan's mother made 22 cookies and threw away 17 of them. So, the number of cookies that Brendan's mother actually gave him is equal to the total number of cookies she made minus the number she threw away. In other words, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of cookies given to Brendan = Total number of cookies made - Number of cookies thrown away

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

Number of cookies given to Brendan = 22 - 17
= 5

So, Brendan had 5 cookies in total.";
Response:  If Brendan's mother made 18 cookies and each guest received an equal number of cookies (9 guests), then each guest would have received 2 cookies (18 / 9 = 2).;
"Response:  If Brendan's mother made 14 cookies for two guests, then each guest received how many cookies? 
We know that Brendan's mother made an equal number of cookies for both guests, so if one guest received x cookies, then the other guest also received x cookies. Therefore, we can write the equation:
x + x = 14
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 14
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 7
So, each guest received 7 cookies from Brendan's mother.";
Response:  If Brendan's mother made 10 cookies for each of her 10 guests, then she made a total of 100 cookies (10 x 10 = 100).;

= 25 x 14
= 350 marbles

So, she needs to deliver 350 marble boxes.";
Response:  If Shirley has 10 boxes of marbles and each box contains 5 marbles, then she needs 5 boxes to have 5 x 5 = 25 marbles in total. Therefore, there are 25 - 10 = 15 marble boxes left over after Shirley takes 5 boxes.;
Response:  The total number of bottles is 67 + 9 = 76. Now we need to find out how many bottles of normal milk they had more than diet milk. So, let's divide the number of bottles of normal milk (67) by the number of bottles of diet milk (9). This gives us 7.44 or approximately 8 bottles. Therefore, they had more than 8 bottles of normal milk than diet milk.;
Response:  The total number of bottles of regular water was 22 and the total number of bottles of dietary water was 61. So, the difference between them is 61 - 22 = 39. Therefore, they had more than 39 bottles of dietary water.;
"Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the numbers of regular and diet cola bottles plus the number of apples. So, we have:
Total = Number of regular cola bottles + Number of diet cola bottles + Number of apples
= 30 + 8 + 41
= 79
Therefore, they had 79 bottles in total.";
Response:  The total number of pulloa (pullets) was 79 + 53 = 132. Now we need to find out how many more normal liver were there than dietary lime. So, let's subtract the number of dietary limes from the total number of pulloa: 132 - 42 = 90. Therefore, there were 90 more normal livers than dietary limes.;
Response:  The total number of fruits and vegetables they had was 54 + 83 = 137. Since there were more than 100 items in each category, we can say that the number of normal food items was greater than the number of dietary food items. Therefore, the answer is: More than 100.;
Response:  The total number of bottles is 17 and out of those, 9 are regular soda and the rest is diet soda. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 9/17 = 5. Now, we have to find out how many diet soda bottles each person drank. Since there were 4 people in total, each person drank an average of 5/4 = 1.25 diet soda bottles. Therefore, they drank 1.25 x 9 = 11 diet soda bottles in total.;
"Response:  The total number of bottles is 105 (19 dietary and 60 regular). To find out how many more regular bottles they had than dietary bottles, we can subtract their numbers:

Number of regular bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of dietary bottles
= 105 - 19
= 86

So, there were 86 more regular bottles than dietary bottles.";
Response:  The total number of fruits is 72 + 32 = 104. Since they have more than 78 omelets, they must have at least 26 fruits other than omelets. Therefore, the number of fruits they have more than omelets is 104 - 78 = 26.;
"Response:  The total number of pulloa (pullets) is given as 36 + 80 = 116. Now we are asked how many more pulloa (pullets) they had than omenaa (onions). So, if they had x pulloa, then they had x - 36 omenaa. Therefore, the number of pulloa (pullets) they had more than omenaa is:
x - 36 = 116
Solving for x, we get:
x = 80
So, they had 80 more pulloa (pullets) than omenaa.";
Response:  The total number of bottles is 30 and out of those, 28 are regular water and only 2 are slimming juice. So, to find out how many bottles of slimming juice they drank, we can divide the number of slimming juice bottles (2) by the total number of bottles (30). Therefore, they drank 2/30 = 1/15 of a bottle of slimming juice.;
Response:  We know that there were four dietary pulloas and 79 more regular pulloas than dietary pulloas. So, in total, they had 83 pulloas of regular limsa (4 + 79). Therefore, the number of pulloas of regular limsa they had is 83.;
Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the numbers of regular soda bottles and diet soda bottles: 57 + 26 = 83. Therefore, they had 83 bottles in total.;
Response:  The total number of bottles is 81 + 60 = 141. Now we know that there are more than 60 bottles of normal milk (since they have more than 60 bottles of light milk). So, the number of bottles of normal milk must be greater than or equal to 60. Therefore, the number of bottles of normal milk is between 60 and 141, inclusive. Since there are only 79 bottles of normal milk, the correct answer is 79.;
Response:  The total number of bottles is 49 + 40 = 89 bottles. So, if they drank 40 bottles of diet soda and 6 bottles of light soda, then they drank a total of 40 + 6 = 46 bottles. Therefore, they drank 46 bottles in total.;
"Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 295 visitors the day before, then we can write an equation based on this information:

Yesterday (day n-1): 295 visitors
Today (day n): 317 visitors

Now we need to find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace today compared to the previous day. To do this, we subtract the number of visitors from one day ago from the number of visitors today:

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22

So, 22 more visitors came to Buckingham Palace today than visited it the previous day.";
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 246 visitors, then the number of visitors in total for the past 25 days is:

703 + (246 x 24) = 703 + 58,960 = 59,663

So, approximately 59,663 people visited Buckingham Palace over the past 25 days.";
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 666 visitors, then the difference between the two numbers is 364 (100 - 666). So, if we subtract this number from the total number of visitors yesterday, we get the number of visitors today: 364 - 100 = 264. Therefore, there were 264 more visitors at Buckingham Palace today than there were yesterday.;
Response:  If there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace today and Rachel found out about it, then the number of visitors yesterday must be equal to the number of visitors today minus the number of visitors today plus 132 (since they visited the palace today). So, if 406 people visited the palace in the last 327 days, then the number of visitors yesterday was 406 - 132 = 274.;
Response:  If 829 people visited Buckingham Palace last week and there were 45 visitors yesterday, then the number of visitors yesterday is equal to 829 / 85 = 9.76 (round up to 10). So, approximately 10 people visited Buckingham Palace yesterday.;
Response:  If there were 188 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 557 visitors, then the difference between the two days is 369 (557 - 188). So, in 57 days, the total number of visitors would be 369 x 57 = 20,430.;
"Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings in the palace and Rachel found out that 661 visitors came to the palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, then we can write an equation as follows:

Let x be the number of visitors who came to the palace yesterday (the previous day).
We know that the total number of visitors today is 661 + x.
So, we can write the equation:

x + 661 = 600 + 600

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 661 = 1200

Subtracting 661 from both sides:

2x = 539

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 269

Therefore, there were 269 visitors to the palace the previous day.";
Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and 419 visitors the previous day. If we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (103), we get 316. So, before the day in question, there were 316 visitors at Buckingham Palace.;
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 471 visitors the day before that, then there were 351 visitors on the day before that (512 - 471 = 351). Similarly, if there were 808 visitors on the day before that, then there were 457 visitors on the day before that (808 - 471 = 457). Therefore, in total, there were 457 + 351 + 808 = 1616 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the last 89 days.;
"Response:  If there were 191 visitors yesterday and 457 visitors the day before that, then the total number of visitors in the past 3 days is:

191 + 457 = 648

Now let's find out how many more visitors came to the palace today compared to the previous 2 days:

648 - (191 + 457) = 648 - 648 = 0

So, there were exactly the same number of visitors to the palace today as there were in the previous 2 days combined.";
"Response:  We know that the total weight of feathers is 628 grams and we need to find out how much more vapor he has. So let's subtract the amount of vapor he already has from the total weight of feathers:

628 g - 159 g = 469 g

So, the man has 469 grams of vapor left.";
"Response:  We know that the girl needs to mix 49 grams of paint with the glue to stick the feathers together. If she has already used 260 grams of glue, then we can calculate how much glue is left as follows:

Glue remaining = Total amount of glue - Amount already used
= 288 grams - 260 grams
= 188 grams

So, the girl has 188 grams of glue left.";
Response:  We know that the total weight of the feathers is 353 grams and we need to find out how much vapor is already available with him. So let's assume he has x grams of vapor already. Now, if he needs 57 grams more for each color, then the number of colors he can make will be 57 / 22 = 2.61 colors. Since there are 7 colors in all, we can say that he can make approximately 2.61 √ó 7 = 18.47 colors. Therefore, he has (353 - x) grams of vapor left.;
Response:  If he has 20 grams of glue and needs 166 grams to stick the feathers together, then he needs an additional 146 grams (166 - 20 = 146) of glue.;
"Response:  We know that there are 557 grams of wax and she needs only 17 grams more. So we can calculate how much each feather weighs as follows:

Total weight of wax = 557 grams
Required amount of wax = 17 grams
Weight of one feather = Total weight of wax / Number of feathers
= 557 grams / Number of feathers

Now, we need to find out how many feathers there are in total. Let's assume that each feather weighs approximately 0.3 grams (this is just an estimate, but it will do for our calculation). Therefore, if there are x feathers, then the total weight of all feathers is:

Total weight of all feathers = Number of feathers √ó Weight of one feather
= x √ó 0.3 grams

Now, we have two equations:

557 grams = x √ó 0.3 grams... (1)
17 grams = x √ó 0.3 grams / Number of feathers... (2)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 560

So, there are 560 feathers in total. Now, let's calculate the weight of each feather:

Weight of one feather = Total weight of all feathers / Number of feathers
= 560 grams / 560
= 1 gram

Therefore, each feather weighs approximately 1 gram.";
Response:  We know that the total amount of glue needed is 492 grams and he has already used 11 grams. So we need to find out how much more glue he needs. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of glue (492 - 11 = 481) by the amount of glue he uses at one time (11 grams). This means he needs an additional 43 grams of glue (481 / 11 = 43).;
Response:  The problem states that there are 94 workers who will fill 90 barrels of grapes in six days. To find out how many barrels of grapes each worker can fill per day, we need to divide the total number of barrels by the number of workers: 90 / 94 = 0.96 or approximately 1 barrel per day per worker. Therefore, approximately 1 barrel of grapes will be filled per day per worker.;
Response:  The task is to fill 90 baskets of grapes in 5 days. If we divide this number by 5, we get... (insert calculation)...which means that approximately 18 baskets of grapes will be filled each day.;
Response:  The total number of tynnyri√§ filled with grapes is 244 + 47 = 301. To find out how many tynnyri√§ will be filled in 146 days, we need to divide the total number of tynnyri√§ by the number of days: 301 / 146 = 2.05 tynnyri√§ per day. So, approximately 2.05 tynnyri√§ of grapes will be filled every day.;
Response:  If they fill 221 tynnyri√§ of grapes per day and they have to fill 77 tynnyri√§ in total, then they will need to fill 77/221 = 0.346 tynnyri√§ of grapes per day. So, in 77 days, they will fill 0.346 x 77 = 26 tynnyri√§ of grapes.;
"Response:  If there are 108 tynnyri√§ of grapes per day and they have to fill 58 tanks in total, then we can calculate how many tanks will be filled each day as follows:

= 66 / 3
= 22 packages
Therefore, the mother has 22 packages.";
"Response:  If √Ñiti buys 28 packages of white shirts and each package contains 56 white shirts, then we can calculate how many white shirts are in each package as follows:
Number of white shirts in each package = Total number of white shirts / Number of packages
= 56 x 28
= 1492
So there are 1492 white shirts in total.";
Response:  If there are 53 white shirts in total and mother buys 57 packages of white shirts, then she has bought 57 x 1 = 57 white shirts. Additionally, if she buys 34 pairs of trousers, then she has 34 + 57 = 91 pieces of clothing in total. Therefore, mother has 91 / 2 (since each package contains two shirts) = 45.5 white shirts left after buying all the clothes.;
Response:  If √Ñiti buys 51 white T-shirts and each pack contains 3 shirts, then she has... (51 / 3) = 17 packets of T-shirts.;
"Response:  If √Ñiti buys 70 white shirts in total and she buys them in packages of 14 each, then we can find out how many white shirts are in each package as follows:

Response:  If you have 26 pouches and each pouch contains an equal number of candies, then you have 26 x 1 = 26 candies in total. Now, if you have 15 chocolates and 52 sweets, that means you have 52 - 15 = 37 sweets left. Since each pouch can hold an equal number of sweets as chocolates, you will have 37 / 2 = 18.5 pouches full of sweets. So, you have 18 pouches and 8.5 pouches full of sweets.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 cups and each cup has the same number of sweets. So, if we have 28 candies in total, then we can divide them equally among the 14 cups, which means each cup will contain 28 / 14 = 2 candies. Now, let's count how many cups we have. If we have 86 cookies, and each cup contains 2 cookies, then we have 86 / 2 = 43 cups of cookies. Therefore, we have 43 + 14 = 57 cups in total.;
"Response:  If Inkantaja gives 5 letters to each of the 10 blocks, then he will give a total of 5 x 10 = 50 letters in all. 
If he gives 25 letters to each of the 4 houses, then he will give a total of 25 x 4 = 100 letters altogether. So there are 100 / 50 = 2 houses per block. Therefore, there are 2 x 10 = 20 blocks in total.";
Response:  Since there are 9 garbage bags in total and each bag contains 10 pieces of trash, we have 9 x 10 = 90 pieces of trash in total. Now, since there are 20 houses in each block, we need to divide the total number of trashes equally among them. So, we will give 90/20 = 4.5 trash bags to each block. Therefore, each block will receive 4-5 garbage bags.;
Response:  If there are six houses in total and each house receives 24 garbage bags, then we need to divide 24 into six parts. There are 4 houses per part (since there are 6 houses in total). So, each house will receive 4/6 = 2/3 of one garbage bag. Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 2/3 x 24 = 16 garbage bags.;
Response:  If the postman delivers 14 letters to each house in total, and he gives two letters to every house, then we can calculate how many houses there are as follows: Number of houses = Total number of letters / Number of letters per house = 14 x 2 = 28 houses. Therefore, there are 28 houses in the area.;
Response:  If there are 20 homes and each home receives 32 pieces of trash, then we need to divide 32 by 20 to find out how many pieces of trash each home will receive. So, the answer is 1.6 (or 16/10) pieces of trash per home.;
Response:  We have to deliver 30 garbage bags to each of the 78 blocks. Since there are 19 houses in each block, we need to divide 30 by 19 to find out how many bags to give to each house. So, we need to give 1.6 garbage bags to each house.;
"Response:  If there are 8 trash bags per 55 blocks and each block has 32 trash bags, then we can calculate how many blocks have 8 trash bags as follows:

Number of trash bags = Number of blocks x Number of trash bags per block
= 55 x 32
= 1700

So, there are 1700 blocks in total.";
Response:  We have to deliver 4 trash bags to each of the 81 blocks in total. Since there are 12 houses in each block, we need to divide 4 by 12 to find out how many trash bags to give to each block. So, we will give 3 trash bags to each block. Therefore, we will give a total of 3 x 81 = 243 trash bags.;

Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 munas and she wants to divide them into four groups. So, we need to find out how many muna each group can have. Since there are 6 kulmaa (angles), we can use each angle twice, so each group will have 2 kulmaa. Now, let's calculate how many muna each group can have: Group 1 - 2 kulmaa x 8 muna = 16 muna Group 2 - 2 kulmaa x 8 muna = 16 muna Group 3 - 2 kulmaa x 8 muna = 16 muna Group 4 - 2 kulmaa x 8 muna = 16 muna Therefore, each group has 16 muna, so the total number of muna in each group is 16 x 4 = 64 muna.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 gold medals and 15 eggs. We need to divide these eggs into three groups. So we can assume that each group will have 5 eggs (since there are 3 groups). Therefore, Group A will have 5 + 5 = 10 eggs, Group B will have 5 + 5 = 10 eggs, and Group C will have 5 + 5 = 10 eggs.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into six groups of eggs. Since each group must contain at least 3 eggs, we can create 6 groups. Therefore, there will be 6 groups or Ryhmiin.;
"Response:  We have 99 bananas and we want to divide them into three groups. Each group can contain at most 33 bananas (since there are 3 groups). So, we will have: Group 1 - 33 bananas; Group 2 - 33 bananas; Group 3 - 33 bananas. Now let's count how many apples and coconuts each group has: Group 1 has 0 apples and 9 mangoes; Group 2 has 0 apples and 6 mangoes; Group 3 has 0 apples and 5 mangoes. Therefore, we have formed 3 groups with the following number of items in each group: Group 1 - 0 apples, 9 mangoes; Group 2 - 0 apples, 6 mangoes; Group 3 - 0 apples, 5 mangoes.";
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 chickens. The number of eggs is greater than the number of chickens, so we can say that for every chicken, there are more than one egg. Therefore, if we divide the total number of eggs (20) by the number of chickens (6), we get an average of more than one egg per chicken. So, Rebecca has more than 5 chickens. 
Question: What is the ratio of boys to girls in a class of 30 students if 14 of them are boys and 16 are girls?  
Formulate a ratio as a fraction or a decimal. 
Answer: Let's use division to find out! If there are 14 boys and 16 girls in the class, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls to get the ratio: 14/16 = 0.875. This means that there are approximately 87.5% boys and 12.5% girls in the class.";
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 gold medals and 12 eggs. Each egg can produce 3 marbles, so she has produced 36 marbles in total (12 x 3 = 36).

Response:  Since there are two eggs and Emily can make 32 necklaces, we need to find out how many eggs each necklace requires. We know that one egg is enough for 4 necklaces (since 4 x 1 = 4), so if Emily has 2 eggs, she can make 2 x 4 = 8 necklaces. Therefore, each necklace requires 1/8 of an egg.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Emily made 11 kuukautiskorua for her friends. Each koru requires 28 helmi√§. So, in total, Emily had 11 x 28 = 308 helmi√§.;
Response:  If Emily can make one koru at a time and each koru has 8 helmios, then she needs to make 8/1 = 8 koruja for every 8 helmios she has. Since she has 16 helmios in total, she needs to make 16 / 8 = 2 times 8 = 16 koruja. So, Emily can make 16 koruja.;
"Response:  We know that there are 18 kaulakorua and 6 helmi√§ in total. So, we need to divide the number of helmios among the kaulakorut. Since each kaulakoru needs at least one helmi, we can start by assigning one helmi to each of the 18 kaulakorua. This means that now we have 18 kaulakorua with one helmi each. Next, we can assign additional helmios to some or all of the remaining kaulakorua, depending on how many helmios each one wants. For example, if Emily decides to give 2 helmios to her friend Sarah, then Sarah will get two helmios out of the six available (since she already has one from earlier). Now, let's count how many helmios each kaulakoru has:

Kaulakoru 1: 1 helmi
Kaulakoru 2: 1 helmi + 1 extra helmi = 2 helmios
...
Kaulakoru 17: 1 helmi + 1 extra helmi = 2 helmios
Kaulakoru 18: 0 helmios (already had one)
Total number of helmios assigned: 6 / 18 = 3.33 helmios per kaulakoru
Therefore, the answer is 3.33 helmios per kaulakoru.";

Response:  We know that out of 859 students from Lawrence County, 8 went to camp and the remaining stayed at home. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students who went to camp = 8. Now, let's find the number of students who stayed at home using the information provided in the passage: Total population of Lawrence County is 828521. Therefore, the number of students who stayed at home can be calculated as follows: Number of students who stayed at home = Total population - Number of students who went to camp. Substituting the values given in the passage, we get: Number of students who stayed at home = 828521 - 8. Simplifying, we get: Number of students who stayed at home = 828433. Therefore, 828433 students stayed at home.;
Response:  We know that out of 61619 residents in Lawrence County, 30423 stayed at home and 31206 went to camp. So, we can calculate how many children from Lawrence County attended summer camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Children who stayed at home = 31206 - 30423 = 7843. Therefore, 7843 children from Lawrence County attended summer camp.;
"Response:  We know that out of 34,044 students from Lawrence County, 13,486 went to camp and 42,494 came to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of students at camp = Number of students from Lawrence County - Number of students who went to camp

Now, let's solve for the number of students at camp:

Number of students at camp = 34,044 - 13,486 = 20,558

Therefore, there were 20,558 students at the camp.";
Response:  We know that from the camp went 610769 people and came back 590796 people. So, we have an increase of 200003 people who were at home during summer vacation. Now, let's calculate how many people are in Lawrence County. To do this, we divide the total number of people who were at home (200003) by the number of people who went to camp (610769).

Response:  We know that Admilla has three more olives than Jackie. So, if Admilla has nine olives, then Jackie must have six olives. Therefore, the number of olives Jackie has is 6.;
Response:  Adilla has 10 olives and Jack has 2 olives. To find out how many more olives Adilla has than Jack, we need to subtract the number of olives Jack has from the number of olives Adilla has. So, the answer is: Adilla has 10 - 2 = 8 more olives than Jack.;
Response:  We know that Jack has 10 olives and Adilla has 9 olives. To find out how many more olives Jack has than Adilla, we need to subtract the number of olives Adilla has from the number of olives Jack has. So, the difference between their numbers is 10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jack has one more olive than Adilla.;
Response:  The number of olives that Jack has is 10 and the number of olives that Amil has is 8. So, we can say that the difference between the number of olives that Jack has and the number of olives that Amil has is 2 (10 - 8). Therefore, the number of olives that Jack has is more than the number of olives that Amil has by 2.;
Response:  We know that Adamiila has 4 more apples than Jacky. So, if Adamiila has x apples, then Jacky has x - 4 apples. Since they have together 6 apples, we can write the equation: x + (x-4) = 6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Adamiila has 3 apples and Jacky has 3 - 4 = -1 apple.;
Response:  We know that Han has more than 9 olives than Adami and Jack together. So, if we assume that Adami and Jack have x olives between them, then Han must have at least 9 + x olives. Therefore, the number of olives Han has is greater than or equal to 9 + x.;

"Response:  We know that Helen made 527 chocolate cookies and 86 raspberry ones yesterday. So, if she made 86 raspberry kakkua (which is equal to 86 x 3 = 258) and 554 chocolate kuusi (which is equal to 554 x 3 = 1652), then we can calculate how many chocolate cookies Helen made as follows:

Chocolate cookies = Total number of cookies - Number of raspberry kakkua
= 527 - 258
= 269

So, Helen made 269 chocolate cookies.";
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 397 rusitleip√§ and today she made 85 rusinakakku. So, the total number of rusinakakku that Helen made is 397 + 85 = 482.;
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies yesterday and 237 today. So, she baked more chocolate cookies today than yesterday. Now, let's calculate how many chocolate cookies Helen baked more of:

More chocolate cookies = Today's chocolate cookies - Yesterday's chocolate cookies
= 237 - 19
= 218

So, Helen baked 218 more chocolate cookies than Rusinakakkuja.";
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 197 chocolate cookies and 46 rye bread rolls. Today, she made 75 rye cakes and 66 chocolate cakes. So, yesterday, Helen made more chocolate cookies than today (197 vs 75).;
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 280 Rusnian cakes and today she made 300 Russian cookies. So, yesterday she made more than 300 Russian cookies. Therefore, the answer is 280 - 300 = -20.;
Response:  We know that Katilla has played 81 games and her friends have played 59 games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 81 = x + 59 where 'x' is the number of games Katilla's friends have played. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation: 22 = x. Therefore, Katilla has more games than her friends (81 - 59 = 22).;
Response:  According to the question, Katylle had 91 DS games, and she gave away 88 of them to her new friends. So, the number of games left with her is 91 - 88 = 13. Now, she has given 53 games to her old friends, so the total number of games she has given away is 13 + 53 = 66. Therefore, the number of games her friend has is 66 - 53 = 13.;
Response:  We know that Katiella has 78 new games and 86 old games in total. And she plays with her friends for 48 new games. So we can calculate as follows: Total number of new games = Number of new games played with friends + Number of new games owned - Number of old games owned = 48 + 78 - 86 = 20. Therefore, Katiella and her friends have 20 new games together.;
Response:  We know that Katiella has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19). Now, we are told that Katiella and her friends have 8 new games together, which means they have a total of 91 games (103 - 8). Finally, we know that Katiella's friends have 69 old games, so their total number of games is 150 (69 + 91). Therefore, the answer to the question is 150.;
Response:  We know that Katiella has 62 new games and 80 old games, so together they have 142 games (62 + 80). Now we need to find out how many old games her friends have. According to the question, her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so their total number of games is 114 (73 + 41). Therefore, the number of old games that Katiella's friends have is 114 - 41 = 73.;
Response:  We know that Kat has more than 63 DS games and Yst√§vill√§ has 57 games. So, we can say that Kat has at least 63 + x games where x is the number of games Yst√§vill√§ has. Therefore, Kat has more than 63 games. The exact number cannot be determined from the given information.;
"Response:  We know that Katilla has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now, we are told that her friends have 34 new games with them. So, the number of games Katilla has more than her friends is:

96 - 34 = 62

Therefore, Katilla has 62 more games than her friends.";
"Response:  We know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19 initially. Then, after one weekend, Jason has $33 left. So, we can calculate how much money Jason earned from working on cars as follows:

$33 (Jason's current amount) - $19 (initial amount) = $14

Therefore, Jason earned $14 from working on cars during the weekend.";
"Response: 
Fred had $86 and spent $10 on cars during the weekend, so now he has $76 ($86 - $10).
Jason had $5 and didn't do any work, so he still has $5.
Now, let's add up the money they have:
$76 + $5 = $81.";
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 and Jason had $16 initially. So, in total they had $35 ($19 + $16). Then, we know that Fred has $40 now, so he gained $40 - $35 = $5 more than what he already had. Similarly, Jason has $69 now, so he gained $69 - $35 = $34 more than what he already had. Therefore, Fred earned $5 more than Jason during the weekend.;
Response:  We know that Fred has $114 and Jason has $22. So, together they have $136. Then we are told that Fred has $21 left after buying something. Therefore, Jason had $78 before he bought anything. Now let's calculate how much money Jason spent during the weekend: $78 - $22 = $56. So, Jason spent $56 during the weekend.;
Response:  Fred had $111 and Jason had $40 before they started working. After one weekend, Fred earned $115 from washing cars and Jason earned $44 from delivering newspapers. So, in total, Fred gained $86 ($115 - $39) and Jason gained $24 ($44 + $2). Therefore, they both made a profit of $86 and $24 respectively.;
"Response: 
Fred had $49 and earned $73 during the weekend, so his new balance is $122 ($49 + $73).
Jason had $3 and earned $50 during the weekend, so his new balance is $53 ($3 + $50).
The difference between their earnings is $69 ($122 - $53). Therefore, they earned $69 from selling newspapers.";
"Response: 
Fred had $78 and spent $25 on gasoline, so now he has $53 ($78 - $25).
Jason had $31 and earned $14 from delivering newspapers, so now he has $45 ($31 + $14).
So, they together made $98 ($53 + $45) from delivering newspapers.";
"Response: 
Fred had $33 last week and Jason had $95 last week. So together they had $128 ($33 + $95).
Fred worked for one day during the weekend and earned $16.
He spent $74 on car maintenance.
So, Fred earned $16 - $74 = -$58 that day (he spent more than he earned).
Therefore, Fred did not earn any money that day.";
Response:  We know that Fred had $47 last week and earned $111 from delivering newspapers. He also made $34 from selling cars. So, his total earnings are: $47 + $111 + $34 = $182. Therefore, Fred has $182 in cash.;
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 71 kg. If she started running every day and lost 20 kg, then her current weight is 51 kg. So, Jessie now weighs 51 kg.;
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg. If she lost weight at a rate of 101 - 27 = 74 kg per week (which is an unrealistic but simple assumption), it would take her approximately 5 weeks to lose 35 kg (from 27 kg to 92 kg). Therefore, before starting to run daily, Jessie weighed around 35 kg more than what is stated in the question.;
Response:  If Jessie started running every day and lost 126 kg (which is equal to 278 lbs), then he weighed 66 kg (or 145 lbs) before starting to run. Therefore, his weight before starting to run was 66 - 126 = -60 kg or -135 lbs.;
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running every day for some time, he lost 35 kg, so now his weight is 34 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg.;
Response:  If Jessie started at 114 kg and lost 50 kg in the first week, then she weighed 64 kg after one week. In the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so now she weighs 28 kg (60 - 50 = 10). Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 28 kg.;
"Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg. If she lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week, then her weight before running must have been:
Weight = 9 kg + (62 kg / 7 days) + (140 kg / 8 days)
= 9 kg + 9 kg/day x 7 days + 140 kg/day x 8 days
= 9 kg + 63 kg + 112 kg
= 284 kg
Therefore, Jessie weighed 284 kg before starting to run.";
"Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 92 kg. Then she started running every day and lost weight at a rate of 56 kg in the first week and 99 kg in the second week. So, how much did Jessie weigh after the first week of running? We can calculate it as follows:
First week (Week 1): Jessie's initial weight - weight loss = 92 kg - 56 kg = 36 kg
Therefore, Jessie weighed 36 kg after the first week of running.";
Response:  If there were initially 95 k√§√§rmett√§ and 61 alligators in the zoo enclosure, then after 64 k√§√§rmetti... (read more);
Response:  If there were initially 97 alligators and 40 of them hid, then there are now 57 alligators left that did not hide (97 - 40 = 57). So, there are 57 alligators that did not hide.;
Response:  If there were initially 75 alligators and 3 crocodiles in the zoo enclosure, then after 82 crocodiles and 19 alligators hid, there would be 0 alligators left to hide because they are all hiding together with the original 3 crocodiles. Therefore, none of them remained hidden.;
Response:  If there were 79 animals in the enclosure and 24 of them are k√§√§rmett√§ (snakes), then the number of alligators is 51 - 24 = 27. Since none of the alligators are hiding, we can conclude that there are 0 alligators hiding, which means that the total number of animals not hidden is 79 - 27 = 52. Therefore, there are 52 animals that are not hiding.;
Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and gave away 30 today. So he has 134 - 30 = 104 tomatoes left today.;
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden and he picked 56 yesterday. So, he had 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden yesterday. Then today, he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left in his garden.;
Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and he picked 154 of them yesterday. So, the number of tomatoes left in the garden is 90 - 154 = -64. Today, he picked 50 more tomatoes from the same garden, so now there are -64 + 50 = 14 tomatoes left in the garden. Therefore, the farmer gathered 14 tomatoes today.;
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes, then we know that he has 3 tomatoes left (since he started with 175). So, the number of tomatoes he has left is 175 - 3 = 172 tomatoes. Similarly, since he picked 172 potatoes, he must have 4 perennials left (since he started with 77). Therefore, the number of perennials he has left is 77 - 4 = 73 perennials.;
"Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 peppers in his garden. If he picked 53 tomatoes, then we know that the number of tomatoes left is:

177 - 53 = 124

So, there are 124 tomatoes left in the garden. Similarly, if he picked 53 tomatoes, then the number of peppers left is:

12 - 53 = -40

Therefore, there are -40 peppers left in the garden.";
Response:  The farmer had initially 105 green and 71 red tomatoes, so in total he had 176 tomatoes (105 + 71 = 176). If he picked 137 tomatoes, then we know that 137 - 176 = -49 tomatoes were left behind. Since negative numbers are not possible, there must be 49 tomatoes left after picking.;
Response:  If each board requires two nails to attach it to the wall, and John has four boards in total, he will need 8 nails (4 boards x 2 nails per board).;
"Response:  If he used 13 large planks and each of them requires 17 nails, then we need to calculate how many nails are needed for all 13 planks:

13 x 17 = 201 nails

But there is an additional requirement that 8 small nails are also needed. So, in total, John needs:

201 + 8 = 209 nails

Therefore, John needs 209 nails to build the wall with 13 large planks.";
"Response:  If Talon sein√§t h√§n naulasi 11 naulaa, which were big trees. If each tree required three nails and eight additional nails were used, then John needs to hang how many boards onto the wall?

Step-by-step calculation:

Number of trees = Number of naulas x Number of nails per tree
= 11 x 3
= 33 trees

Total number of nails used = Number of trees x Number of nails per tree
= 33 x 8
= 264 nails

Therefore, John needs to hang 264 boards onto the wall.";
Response:  The total number of large boards used = 12 x 3 = 36. And the total number of small boards used = 10 x 2 = 20. So, the total number of nails needed = 36 + 20 = 56. Therefore, John needs 56 nails to build the wall.;
Response:  If each board needs two nails and John used 16 boards, then he needed 32 nails in total. So, John needed 32 nails to attach the wooden boards to the wall of his house.;
"Response:  If John needs to use eight large wooden boards for his wall and each board requires 74 nails, then we can calculate how many boards he will need as follows:

Number of boards = Total number of nails / Number of nails per board
= 74 x 8
= 580

So, John will need 580 wooden boards for his wall.";
"Response:  We know that there are 12 large and 17 small pieces of wood. If we assume that each large piece requires 14 nails, then we need:

Large pieces: 12 x 14 = 168 nails
Small pieces: 17 x 25 = 425 nails
Total number of nails needed: 168 + 425 = 593 nails
Therefore, John needs 593 nails to build the fence.";
Response:  There are 3 pieces in each package and 42 packages in total. Therefore, Robinilla has 42 x 3 = 126 pieces of candy.;
Response:  We know that there are 43 purkkaa in total and 23 of them belong to Robinilla. So, the number of purkkaa belonging to Robinilla is 23/43 = 0.536 (or approximately 1/2). Therefore, Robinilla has 1/2 or 50% of the total purkkaa.;
Response:  We know that in each package there are seven balls and Robinilla has six extra balls. So, in total, Robinilla has 6 + 7 = 13 balls. Since each package contains 7 balls, we can conclude that Robinilla has 13 / 7 = 1.85 packages. Therefore, Robinilla has 19 packages of balls.;
Response:  There are 28 pancakes and 13 cakes in total. Since there are four pieces of each type, we can calculate the number of pancakes as follows: 28 / 4 = 7. So, Robinilla has 7 pancakes.;
Response:  We know that there are 21 pancakes and 45 cookies in total. Since there are nine pieces of candy in each pack, we can calculate how many candies Robin has as follows: Number of pancakes = Total number of pancakes / Number of pancakes per pack = 21 / 9 = 3 Therefore, Robin has 3 groups of 9 candies each or a total of 27 candies.;
Response:  We know that there are 28 pancakes and 14 candies in total. Since there are six pieces of candy per pack, we can calculate how many packs of candy Robin has as follows: Number of packs = Total number of candies / Number of candies per pack = 14 / 6 = 2. Therefore, Robin has 2 packs of candies.;
Response:  The machine can make three shirts per minute. If it made six shirts in total, that means it was working for x minutes. So we have the equation: 6 = 3x. To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 2. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes.;
Response:  The machine worked for five minutes and can produce four shirts per minute. So in five minutes, it produced 4 x 5 = 20 shirts.;
"Response:  The machine made 9 pairs yesterday and 44 pairs today. If it makes three pairs per minute, then... Yesterday, the machine worked for... Today, the machine worked for... 
Explanation: To find out how many minutes the machine worked yesterday, we need to divide the number of pairs it made by the number of pairs it can make in a minute. So, if it made 9 pairs yesterday and can make 3 pairs in a minute, then it worked for 9/3 = 3 minutes. Similarly, to find out how many minutes the machine worked today, we need to divide the number of pairs it made today by the number of pairs it can make in a minute. So, if it made 44 pairs today and can make 3 pairs in a minute, then it worked for 44/3 = 14 minutes.";
Response:  The machine made 13 pairs yesterday and 3 today. That means it makes 8 pairs per minute. So, in total, the machine worked for... (calculate)...minutes.;
Response:  The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 today. This means it makes 2 shirts per minute. Therefore, the machine worked for x minutes today. Since we know that the machine works continuously, we can say that x = total time taken to complete the task / number of shirts produced. In this case, x = (number of shirts produced) / (time taken to complete the task). Substituting the values given in the question, we get x = (9 + 8) / 2 = 16/2 = 8 minutes. So, the machine worked for 8 minutes today.;
Response:  The machine can make three shirts per minute. Yesterday it made four shirts and today it made eight shirts. So in total, the machine worked for... (4 + 8) = 12 minutes.;
Response:  The machine can make six shirts per minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday and 14 shirts today. So, in total, the machine made... (calculate)...shirts!;
Response:  Yesterday, the machine could make 5 shirts per minute. Today, it made 12 shirts in total. So, if we divide the number of shirts made today by the time taken yesterday, we get... (calculate)...the answer is 6 shirts per minute!;
Response:  They earned $165 in 5 days, so they earned $33 per day.;
Response:  They earned $144 per day and were at the carnival for 22 days. Therefore, they earned in total... ($144/day x 22 days) = $3088.;
Response:  The amount of money they earned each day is $420 / 30 = $14 per day. They received $22 in total, so they spent $22 / $14 = $1.64 per day playing the game. Therefore, the number of days it took to earn $420 was 420 / $1.64 = 257 days.;
Response:  The game raised $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days, for a total of $756.;
"Response:  The total amount of money earned in the first 20 days is $120, and there are 16 remaining days. So, we can calculate the daily earnings as follows:

Daily earnings = Total amount earned / Number of days
= $120 / 20
= $6 per day

Therefore, they earned $6 per day during the first 20 days.";
Response:  The total amount of money collected in the first 154 days is $325. In the remaining 57 days, they collected $114, which means they collected an average of $20 per day during that period. Therefore, they collected $20 x 57 = $1140 in the last 57 days.;
"Response:  Lucy bought 10 packets of cookies and 4 packets of cake. If she bought x packets of bread instead of cake, then we can write an equation as follows:

Lucy bought x packets of bread = 4 packets of cake - (10 packets of cookies + x packets of bread)

Now let's solve for x:

x = 4 - (10 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 6

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 3

So Lucy bought 3 packets of bread instead of cake.";
"Response:  Lucy bought x packets of cookies (x), y packets of chocolate (y), and z packets of candy (z). We know that x + y + z = 40 (the total number of packets she bought). Now we can solve for each variable separately: x + y = 38 (since there are 38 packets in total); y = 17 (since Lucy bought 22 packets of chocolate); and z = 13 (since she bought 16 packets of candy). So Lucy bought 13 packets of candy.";
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of cake. The total number of packages she bought is given as 27. So, we can deduce that she bought x - 23 packages of cake, where x is the total number of packages she bought. Since she had 27 packages in total, we can set up the equation: x = 27 - 23 = 4. Therefore, Lucy bought 4 packages of cake.;
"Response:  If Lucy bought two packages of cookies and 12 packages of candy, she had $56 left after buying them. So, if she bought x packages of cookies, then she spent $x/2 dollars for them (since each package costs half as much as the other). Similarly, if she bought y packages of candy, she spent $y dollars for them. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$56 = ($x/2) + $y

Now, we need to solve for x and y. We know that x + y = 12 (the number of packages of candy she bought), so we can substitute this value into our first equation:

($x/2) + ($y) = $56

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$x + $y = $56

Subtracting $y from both sides gives us:

$x = $48

So, Lucy bought 12 packages of candy (y = 12). Since each package of candy cost $y = 12$, Lucy paid a total of $12 \times 12 = $144 for all the candy she bought.

As for the cookies, since Lucy bought 2 packages of cookies, she paid $2 \times 2 = $4 for them. Therefore, Lucy spent a total of $144 + $4 = $148 for all the food she bought.";
"Response:  We know that there were initially 12 people in the bus and then 4 more got on at the next stop. So, the total number of people in the bus now is:

12 + 4 = 16

So, there are 16 people in the bus.";
Response:  At first, there were eight people in the bus (kahdeksan). Then, 12 new people boarded the bus and 3 people got off (12 + 3 = 15). So, there are now 15 people in the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus (the initial number). Then, 9 more people got into the bus (the additional number), so the total number of people in the bus is: 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people in the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train (including the 8 new passengers). So, the total number of people in the train is 11 + 8 = 19.;
"Response:  The number of participants in the program was 22 older adults and a total of 676 people. To find out how many students were in the program, we need to divide the total number of participants by the number of older adults. So, if there were 22 older adults and 654 other people (a total of 676), then the number of students in the program is:

Number of students = Total number of participants / Number of older adults
= 676 / 22
= 30
Therefore, there were 30 students in the program.";
"Response:  The number of old people is given as 73 and there are 724 students in total. Therefore, the number of students minus the number of old people gives us the total number of people in the program. So, we can write:
Number of people = Number of students - Number of old people
= 724 - 73
= 651
Therefore, there were 651 people in the program.";
"Response:  The total number of students is given as 695 (174 + 521). To find out how many students were present with their parents, we need to subtract the number of older students from the total number of students. So, the number of students who were present with their parents is:

695 - 174 = 521

Therefore, there were 521 students present with their parents.";
Response:  We know that there were 61 older people and 177 students participating in the program. Since each group had 44 places available, we can calculate the total number of participants as follows: Total number of participants = Number of older people + Number of students x Number of places per group Total number of participants = 61 + (177 x 44) = 61 + 7880 = 8491 So, there were 8491 individuals involved in the program.;
Response:  The distance from the bottom of the cave to the surface is 3500 meters. To find out how far away the entrance is, we need to divide this distance by two since they have to travel upwards. So, the distance from the entrance to the bottom of the cave is 1750 meters (3500 / 2).;
"Response:  The distance traveled so far is given as $849$ jalkaa. If they move at a speed of $17$ nopeudella (jalka/sekunti), in how many seconds have they moved?

$$\therefore \text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{849}{17} = 50 \text{ sekunnia}$$

Now, since they are moving for $50$ seconds, they will cover a distance of:

$$\therefore \text{Distance covered} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{849}{50} = 16,98 \text{ jalkaa}$$

Therefore, the distance from the entrance to the deepest point in the cave is $16,98$ jalkaa.";
Response:  We know that they have walked for 659 steps and are currently at a depth of 762 feet in the hole. To find out how far away from the end of the hole they are, we need to divide the distance they have traveled (659 steps) by their current depth (762 feet). This gives us an estimate of how many steps it will take them to reach the bottom of the hole: 659 / 762 = 0.86 or approximately 86% of the way down the hole. So, they are about 86% of the way down the hole from where they started.;
Response:  We know that Paige had raised eight goldfish in a pond. Suddenly, how many goldfish disappeared? Therefore, we can conclude that two goldfish disappeared. So, the answer is 2.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 sunfish in her pond, but the ducks ate them all up. Now she has 15 fish left. So, we can calculate that initially, Paige had 7 + 12 = 19 fish in total. Since some of them were eaten by the ducks, let's say 15 (the number of fish left) - 19 (total initial number of fish) = -4. Therefore, 4 fish disappeared or got eaten by the ducks.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 smelt in her pond, but the ducks ate them all. Now she has two left. So, we can calculate the number of goldfish that disappeared as follows: Number of goldfish = Total number of goldfish - Number of goldfish remaining = 16 - 2 = 14 Therefore, 14 goldfish disappeared.;
Response:  We know that Paige has 15 goldfish in total and 5 have already been eaten by the guppies. So, we can calculate how many goldfish are left as follows: Number of goldfish remaining = Total number of goldfish - Number of goldfish eaten = 15 - 5 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left.;
Response:  At first, Piirka had 43 omelets and then he used some to make pirakas (piirade). After that, he had 2 omelets left. So, Piirka used 41 omelets to make pirakas.;
Response:  We know that Kokilla had 58 olives and she made 17 piers using 35 of them. So, we have to find out how many olives are left after making those piers. To do this, we need to subtract the number of olives used in each pier from the total number of olives Kokilla had. For example, if Kokilla used 5 olives to make one pier, then she will have 58 - 5 = 53 olives left. Therefore, there are 53 olives left.;
Response:  We know that Kokilla had 40 olives and 54 grapes to start with. After pipping them, he had 39 left. So, if we divide the number of olives (40) by the total number of fruits (54), we get the number of olives used in piping = 40/54 = 75%. Therefore, Kokilla used 75% of the olives for piping.;
"Response:  The total number of action heroes that can fit in the room is given as 11. Since there are four shelves and each shelf has 4 compartments (kaappia), we have:
Number of compartments = Number of action heroes x Number of shelves
Compartments = 11 x 4 = 44
So, there are 44 compartments or shelves in the room where the action heroes can be placed.";
Response:  We know that there are 8 action heroes in the room and 10 action heroes were supposed to fit in the room. So, we need to find out how many of them did not fit in the room. Therefore, the number of hangers = 10 - 8 = 2.;
Response:  The room can accommodate eight action heroes and ten hostages. Since each action hero takes up one space, there are eight spaces available for them. Similarly, since each hostage takes up one space, there are ten spaces available for them. Therefore, the total number of items that can fit in the man's room is 8 + 10 = 18.;
Response:  There are 544 gardens in total, and each garden has 32 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 544 x 32 = 17,688.;
Response:  We have 466 containers (ruukku) in total. Each container has 53 flowers and 181 bees. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of containers x Number of flowers per container Total number of bees = Number of containers x Number of bees per container Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,908 Total number of bees = 466 x 181 = 87,366 Therefore, there are 24,908 flowers and 87,366 bees in total.;
Response:  We have 141 ruukkua in total and each ruukku has 71 kukkaa. So, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total number of ruukkua x Number of kukkaa per ruukku = 141 x 71 = 9631 kukkaa In addition to the flowers, there are also 91 keys in each ruukku. Therefore, the total number of keys is: Total number of keys = Number of ruukkua x Number of keys per ruukku = 141 x 91 = 12591 keys;
Response:  We know that in each pot there are 40 flowers and altogether there are 400 flowers. So, if we divide the total number of flowers by the number of pots, we get: Number of pots = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers in each pot = 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 pots.;
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in total and 4276 pebbles. If we divide the number of pebbles by the number of skittles, we get an average of how many pebbles each skittle has (since they are equally divided). So, the average number of pebbles per skittle is:
$$\frac{4276}{4502} = \boxed{0.96}$$
Now, let's assume that each group of pebbles contains $r$ pebbles, where $r$ is a positive integer. Since there are $154$ groups in total, we can write:
$$\boxed{4276 = r \times 0.96^{153}}$$
Solving for $r$, we get:
$$\boxed{r = \frac{4276}{0.96^{153}}} = \boxed{468}$$
So, each group of pebbles contains approximately $468$ pebbles.";
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4950 pyyhkies. If we divide the number of pyyhkies by the number of Skittles, we get an average of how many pyyhkies each Skittle has. So, the average number of pyyhkies per Skittle is (4950/3941) = 12.16. Now, if we round up this value to the nearest whole number, we get 13 pyyhkies per Skittle. Therefore, each group of pyyhkies will contain 495 / 13 = 37 Ryhmi√§.;
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and 517 pencils. Since each pencil can be used to draw one line, we have drawn 517 lines. Now, let's count how many spaces are left between these lines. There are 90 windows and 3 empty spaces, so there are 93 spaces left. Since each space represents a group of Skittles, we have 93 groups of Skittles. Therefore, each group has 9 Skittles (9 x 9 = 81). So, the size of each group is 81 Skittles.;
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has an equal number of students, then we can assume that there are 5 classes (270 / 5 = 54). So, there are 5 classes in total with an equal number of students in each class.;
Response:  In class 304, there are 75 students per class. So, in total, there are 304 x 75 = 22,500 students in all classes combined.;
